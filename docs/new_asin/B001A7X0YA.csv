3446000,4,B001A7X0YA,"This latest Barbie video, a cross between ""Best Friends"" and fairytale, is one of the more original films Mattel have produced and my seven-year old children thoroughly enjoyed it.

It begins with Barbie and Teresa practicing a guitar duet when a smaller girl bursts in having just had a terrible row with her best friend. Barbie starts to tell her a story of two friends who were put in great danger because each thought her friend had betrayed her, but their friendship won out in the end ...

The friends concerned, Liana and Alexa, share everything, including their love of music. One day they are given a magic mirror - and find a girl, Melody, magically hiding inside it.

Melody is an apprentice to the three muses who use the magical ""Diamond castle"" to inspire and spread music through the land. Unfortunately one of the muses, Lydia, wants to be the sole ruler of music. With the aid of her magical flute and an evil winged serpent called Slider, Lydia has turned her fellow muses to stone. Melody has the secret key to the Diamond castle, so Lydia and Slider are searching for her.

Alexa and Liana set out to help Melody rescue the petrified muses and overthrow Lydia - they will face dangers and deception along the way.

The story is one of friendship rather than romance, but ""Ken"" makes an appearance as Ian and Jeremy, a pair of rascally but warm-hearted twins who are travelling musicians. Ian and Jeremy share the role of comic relief with two adorable puppies, Sparkles and Lily: the twins have been given some quite amusing dialogue with plenty of ironic banter, probably intended to keep adults who are watching the film with their offspring amused.

Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, over-sugary and over here. However, I have been pleasantly surprised.

Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccarine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including ""The Diamond Castle"" was significantly higher than I would have originally expected, and the quality has kept rising as each successive Barbie film seems to be more beautifully made than the last. They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music.

Prsonally I love classical music and want my children to have the opportunity to learn to appreciate it. So it was a big positive for me when I was listening to CDs of classics such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's magic flute, and my daughter, then aged five, recognised the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)

With one exception the soundtrack to ""The Diamond Castle"" isn't taken from the classics, the songs in the musical are all modern. (The exception is a pastiche of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" which plays when the castle finally appears near the climax of the film. The orchestral accompaniment was recorded by a top rank classical orchestra, the Czech Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra. In my opinion Arnie Roth, who conducted the orchestra and co wrote the music with David Blamire, did a good job of it - almost as good the music he wrote for ""The Princess and the Pauper"" which has the best soundtrack of those Barbie films which have new music rather than raiding the classics.

Those people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.

And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my own daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality. However, if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy female body shape is, it is not quite impossible that this film may contribute to it.

Barbie is often accused of reinforcing gender stereotyping, but I don't think the charge is entirely fair, and even less for this film than most of the others - insofar as gender stereotypes are present in ""The Diamond Castle"" the film appears to be taking the mickey out of them.

On the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so.

Or alternatively, if you want to watch it with your children, there are a fair number of more sophisticated jokes thrown in to keep you amused.",1220918400,36,4925,4.738317757009346
3446001,5,B001A7X0YA,"I pre-ordered this and was pleasantly surprised to find it in the mail one day before it went on sale to the public. My girls, ages 3 & 5 1/2 immediately wanted to see it. This is one of the best Barbie movies, and we own them all. As another reviewer said the last couple movies haven't been as good, but still wholesome. Barbie always has beutiful music, a moral, beautiful costumes, and a handsome prince. In the diamond castle two best friends set out to defeat evil together. What more could a little girl ask for? These are movies I can sit through myself. You won't be sorry with this latest product from Barbie. Of course now we'll have to get the Barbies...",1220918400,37,666,4.379032258064516
3446002,5,B001A7X0YA,My 6 year-old daughter and I were very excited to see this preview. She gets every new Barbie movie for her birthday. We really enjoyed Barbie and the Diamond Castle. We will definitely be purchasing this when it is released!,1220745600,4,225,4.65
3446003,5,B001A7X0YA,"Ok, I'm not a huge fan. But w/ a 4yr old girly-girl, I can appreciate the Barbie movies.

It seems to me that the last 2 movies have been so-so. Needless to say, I wanted to rent this one first. I am happy though! I just finished watching it's pre-dvd, TV airing & I will actually be buying this one.",1220745600,6,300,4.0
3446004,5,B001A7X0YA,"Another amazing Barbie movie! I'm way over the target demographic, but it's such a cute movie. Great songs (as good as Princess and the Pauper!), and the same charming Parisian boudoir graphics. The song sang by Sara Paxton in Aquamarine, ""Connected"", is sung by them too with a lovely new twist. Good morals for kids, that friends may be different, but you have got to stick with them. All the songs have great harmonies! And there is a new type of look, namely the Muse sisters look very Egyptian/European (something new in Barbie movies...)

In a nutshell, two best friends (Alexa and Liana) along with a girl (Melody) trapped in a mirror, must save the Diamond Castle (the birthplace of music) from an evil witch who has stolen music and trapped another world in darkness. Two charming (but a tad cocky!) boys are here to help them along the way. It's even better because they throw in catchy songs and beautiful graphics (prettier than a Pottery Barn Teen catalog even!)",1220745600,6,975,4.735294117647059

3446099,4,B001A7X0YA,"I bought this movie for my daughter when she started collecting the other movies. I read the reviews before buying and against the judgment of other mothers, I purchased this. I felt that this movie didn't show any scary parts that would be sensitive to kids other than tragic parts. When the house burned, no one died so it isn't really scary. Secondly I do not see how the men imposed a one night stand when the girls were mad at them. You would have to be thinking about that when you watch it to see it that way. I didn't however like the music as it was quite pitchy and the one girl seems to be like greedy and would rather get something handed to her then help a friend. I thought the dogs were kind of dumb however my daughter enjoyed them. I think this movie is appropriate for kids to watch and I feel it would keep there attention while teaching them about friendship.",1405987200,,879,4.269461077844311

The storyline is good and for the most part the characters are well done.  I rated it four stars primarily because I thought the male characters were more annoying than interesting.

3446175,5,B001A7X0YA,".....about this movie. One negative review said this:

""The two princely characters aren't princes but instead Lotharios. In the first scene in which they appear, some women in a tavern are mad at them for one-night stands when they expected love. The men flee and then follow the Barbie girls to try to seduce them. At first the Barbies don't want to have much to do with them and one says ""you're kidding?!""

It should be noted here:  is this reviewer AWARE of the age group that these Barbie movies are being marketed to? Do they really think that the children watching this are really going to ""pick-up"" on these kinds of ""messages""?

I don't think so.

But, be that as it may, here are my thoughts.

The Diamond Castle is my favorite of the Barbie movies, (& I have over a dozen of them), because it has an extremely compelling story line, but most of all, because of the music.  I spent many years in music, & the songs, & the importance of music in this movie, are integral to the movies plot.

It is an EXTREMELY exciting story, as the race comes down to who can restore things right, between Alexa & Liana to find the castle, & Lydia's attempt to stop them.

When Liana & Alexa finally realize how to bring the castle back, that was absolutely brilliant what Liana figured out what the ""key"" really was!

NO, taking into account the age group that these Barbie movies are marketed to, I see no problem with this or any of the other Barbie movies.

BTW: I am a 57 y/o male who also runs an online animation forum, so I have a much less ""biased"" view of this movie!

I MOST definitely recommend this movie!",1325894400,,1613,4.375838926174497
3446176,4,B001A7X0YA,"Ugh, if I have to watch one more Barbie movie I at least want it to be this one!  This Barbie movie has the best soundtrack BY FAR, with songs that have great guitar instrumentation, fun and cute lyrics, and amazing vocals! No seriously!  My daughter has most of the Barbie movies out there, and even at 3.5 loves to sing all the songs from this movie.  So, if you have an avid Barbie Fan and can deal with the ""Sims-like"" graphics found in all the Barbie movies, then this is the ONE you must buy!

Barbie & The Diamond Castle is a really good kids' DVD, with just enough action and tension to keep the rest of the household watching.

3446186,3,B001A7X0YA,"Well as my review title stated, this wasn't our favorite Barbie movie, and yes, we have them ALL!! The plot on this was a little bit thin, not that that matters for a movie aimed at 5 year olds, but a woman who wants to become, not the ruler of the world, but the only ""singing muse""  So she resorts to evil and murder to do so. WHAT?? I had an especially good time explaining to my daughter the scene in which the barmaid pours water over one of the ""player"" princes heads... ""why did she do that mommy?""  ""well you see honey, its because he had sex with her then didn't call her back ever again...this is commonly referred to as a one night stand""  yeah right!
No but the music was just okay, silly storyline, and it gets really old how Barbie is just the pillar of morals in every movie... even when she is sharing screen time with her bff, she is still the one who does everything ""perfectly""... figures out the riddle, gives her food to the starving woman, takes Melody on when Alexa won't go, risks her life to switch the mirrors at the beginning, etc.

I'm sure you've read all the other reviews so I won't recap the storyline, but it is one of the last BArbie movies made where she is telling a story at the beginning; so this seems more like a fantasy then a real life happening; if you know what i mean. I miss that in the new Barbie movies.
Great songs, easy to sing along to, Barbie and her BFF have great voices, which makes it easy to listen to as well.
I love how these 2 girls save the day...and the boys merely are there to help out! Girl Power at its Best!

I just felt sad after watching this. There were no magical moments. It felt like they ran out of storylines.....like they chewed on a bunch of stories old & new & spit out this one. I noticed that they are starting to churn out these movies......and they are becoming like a show you could watch on tv .........BORING!

I wish that mattel would read these reviews, and make the effort to return to the quality of the originals such as Rapunzel, Swan Lake, Princess & pauper & pegasus......otherwise start selling them at a lower price",1276214400,,796,4.925373134328358

(yes, at age 3, outtakes seem to make sense.)It puts it all into perspective. The movies are colorful, calm and the music is not annoying.

Every element that is attractive to little girls is in this movie: singing, dancing, best friends, food fights, clothes, guitar playing, puppies, castles, cute boys, and of course the obligatory evil ""witch"" and her dragon.

3446204,2,B001A7X0YA,"I am astonished at all the adults writing glowing reviews of Barbie movies!  I can only think that the adults who rate them highly love them because the kids they love adore the movies.  These movies are plasticky drawn animated characters (like Barbie herself, I suppose) that are so without any facial expression that it's creepy, the lyrics and music are painfully sophmoric, and the dialogue and stories are mind-numbingly cliched.

This movie in particular has the added annoyance of the usually wonderful Tim Curry (a real Brit) overacting and actually sounding like he's doing a bad British accent a creepy ogre, and two playah male characters that have jilted lovers in their town.  Ick.

That said, my 6 year old and even the 1 1/2 year-old love these movies and they're harmless enough.  But you can't call these exceptional for any reason.  They're bland time-killers for the kids.

I love to sit down and watch movies with my kids, so I appreciate any movie that's at least watchable.  Like the Disney classics as well as the new ones they're making (Disney seems to be undergoing another renaissance), as well as ANYTHING made by Pixar, and SOME of the Dreamworks films.  For simpler films, we've enjoyed National Geographic Kids, and some PBS shows on DVD  like Jakers.

3446213,4,B001A7X0YA,"Hey, this is a great movie, and I really do love it.
I love all the Barbie movies dearly, but lately I'm noticing changes.
1. Barbie's face
  her face is so different! It's morphing into a more plastic-y form. The nose is tiny, and her eyes aren't as deep and beautiful a blue.
2. The movies are becoming so different. No romance! Call me crazy but I personally love true-love romance (like in Swan Lake, where the two lovers loved each other more than themselves and would die to save the other. Mmm... :) so sweet.)
3. The dogs, Lily and Sparkles, aren't like real puppies at all. They practically talk to their humans and walk on two feet! I prefer the cats on the Princess and the Pauper. Much more realistic, and cuter, too!

Other than that, this is a very enjoyable movie. The princes, I must admit are wierd and make you uncomfortable at times, but they are funny in their sarcastic, carefree manner and faked arrogance. And they are far more handsome than some of the other princes. (i.e. Louis, from the 3musketeers, who is the worst-looking prince I've ever seen in a barbie movie.) I didn't really care for the way Liana and Alexa's dresses magically changed at the gateway. There's always a change from Barbie's old, plain dress to the signature, fancy, movie-cover dress, and they were just trying to get that change in there, and a little magic is good for little girls. And it turned out looking kinda cheesy. But the other parts are much more mature and interesting for older girls. It's aimed more towards preteens and early teens. Adults might enjoy, too. I love this movie and I'm glad to see some more mature issues without being too mature and keeping the magical little-girl sense. But one more thing, something other reviews have said was that the girls were lesbian. WHAT? Come on people, when you were little, wasn't it your dream for your very best friend to live in the same house as you? I used to imagine we were sisters, so I could be with her every day. Don't make something like that up and smear mud on a kid's movie. If this were an adult movie, sure, it'd be concerning, but it's not! It's a movie for little girls who know nothing about that and I hate to see parents going, ""oh, they must be lesbian"" and thus having to explain to their kids why they tossed the movie out. If you've read a review saying that the girls are lesbian, ignore them because they aren't!!!",1239235200,,2404,4.4840182648401825

We were not familiar with the story, we just thought the dolls were pretty and they were on sale.  So, we saw the DVD and purchased it.  Like other reviewers here, I agree that there are mature themes in this movie that I wasn't expecting. When you watch a movie made for a younger audience you don't want to see characters like the ""prince twins"" in this movie.  As an adult, I understood the scene where a woman threw a shoe at them.  My 3 yr old didn't understand it.  She just enjoyed the music.  She doesn't know what ""backstabbing friend"" means.  There is no need for that in this movie.  They could have presented this in a more innocent way. My husband thinks she is too young for Barbie but face it - this is the age group that finds these movies interesting. One more thing, my daughter kept asking, ""When are we going to see the Diamond Castle?""  Good question.  It took quite a long time to get to that part.

However, my kid eats these movies up. In a child's mind, the movies are very different, because the characters have different names, different clothes, and different castles.

3446236,2,B001A7X0YA,"Absolutely disgusting. What do you get when you pair the worlds' most anatomically daring blonde doll with a couple of gooey eyed dogs? Well, its ""Barbie and the Diamond Castle"", yet another film in the famed Barbie cannon, that will have young girls (and some boys) in their therapists' offices for many many more years to come. Oh glory!

I actually have seen this - truth be told, I got it for free, and thought, ""Hey, why not spend an evening gouging my eyes out with audiovisual abuse?"". And I went on from there. As Amazon says, ""Barbie and the Diamond Castle opens with Barbie and her friend Teresa singing, playing guitar, and relating a story about friendship to Stacy who's just had a disagreement with her best friend Courtney."" But oh, dear reader, it is so much more complexthan that. If only you knew!

To cut things short, Barbie tells us a tale about loss in this story. Even though shes not in it much, she makes sure to hog the limelight. That Barb! The music is something off a Miley Cyrus soundtrack, and the two animals really got on my nerves. Seriously, its 2008. Do we still have to reduce cartoon animals to these slithering blobs of cuteness who do nothing except elicit oohs and aahs?

If I was 3, I would probably be eating this up, but since I'm not, I'm gonna go with a negative ranking and a review summary of ""Nonsense"". AVOID.",1226620800,3,1359,4.493927125506073
3446237,4,B001A7X0YA,"As I am reading the reviews for this DVD, which we recently purchased, I was dumbfounded at the speculation of the Lesbian subplot!  First, I have no problem with alternative lifestyles; it's an individual choice.  With that said, I suppose if you are ""looking"" for it or have something against being gay, you could find that kind of subplot in some twisted way -- but I would challenge any pre-k to tween age kid to find it.  Kids who would enjoy this movie are all about friends at this time in their lives, and are learning what friendships are and just how they work.  It's a great story of unconditional friendship.  Period.

I did raise an eyebrow for a moment at the scene where the women in the tavern were obviously miffed by Jeremy's and Ian's arrival -- but it was not clear exactly why they were miffed to my Daughter.  If she was older it might have been awkward trying to explain the ""one night stand"" dynamic.

The incidents of more mature concepts could be compared to the humor you find in Shrek or Madagascar, whereas there is an adult level of humor that kids don't pick up on, but parents do, and that makes the movie enjoyable for the parents.  I think this approach is something new for the Mattel films, and perhaps they just need some time to refine their comedic passes.

The music is great, and ecclectic too!  I love the contrast in music from rock and roll, to contemporary to classical.  The tunes are catchy and I even find myself singing along when I hear it -- which my Daughter thinks is fun.

In general I'm happy with the purchase.  My Daughter loves the movie and would watch it over, and over, and over again, if I let her.  Isn't that what really matters?

I'd love to give it 5 stars, but I think Mattell needs to polish up their attempts to camouflage adult humor.",1226361600,,1804,4.421212121212121

3446239,3,B001A7X0YA,"Parents may want to beware of this latest title in the so far excellent series of Barbie DVDs. Up to now, the DVDs have had classic stories with age appropriate dialogue and sequences. The Barbie DVDs remain delightfully innocent and playful.
This latest DVD starts from the outset hinting at lesbian tendencies in the songs (which may confuse young viewers as to the intent behind the words). This theme is reinforced by two smooth tongued men seeking sex with the two heroines. They evolve in helping the two friends and end up looking like frat boys with good hearts. At the conclusion, it is left somewhat ambiguous as two whether Barbie and her best friend are indeed straight. There are some nice special effects, like the redone Stargate Atlantis ""castle"" rising from the water. Rainmaker Effects took the same dazzling sequence and cartooned it up and made it girly, to represent the Diamond Castle, instead of the city of Atlantis, from the hit SciFi TV show.
While not an open declaration of lesbian celebration, this latest Barbie DVD is quite a departure from the sweet and innocent titles so far to date. The themes are too mature for young girls.
I apologize to anyone who may be offended, as I certainly to not criticize alternative lifestyle choices. I feel that young girls may not have the fully developed intellect to overcome suggestion through the DVD content.",1225238400,5,1381,4.8559322033898304

This move had a pretty catchy song called ""connected"" and the animals were cute..as always but this time they did not wear as much makeup.

Some things I found interesting:

*This is the first time I have seen Barbie's sister Stacey.. usually Kelly is getting the camera time but when Barbie is your sister I guess you can be a star too..it is just like in real life..famous relative etc.

*As soon as the movie shows the scenes with the two maidens singing to eachother you can feel the strong lesbian subplot. This plot is confirmed by the end of the movie when the girls do not go with the princes and continue to live together in their cottage.

I found the plot refreshing and the movie creative and different!

We have bought every Barbie movie in the past year (she is 3 years old) and this has been our absolute favorite.  The storyline is more geared toward older kids, but with all of the singing and characters, it definately will keep a young child's attention as well.  The songs are very catchy...she loves them and is constantly wanting mommmy and daddy to sing along.  Even my husband can tolerate watching it, which is saying a lot.",1223942400,3,539,4.525773195876289

I rented this from the library asap when it came to the library and I'm so glad I did this is one of the best Barbie movies they have came out with so far and I'm 20 and I loved the movie personally I think it's a movie that pretty much everybody can enjoy and relate to if they love The Middle Ages Era (The Reinassance) Mattel is absolutely genius for making this movie.  Excellent movie get's five star's from me.

Does anyone know if their going to make this movie into a ds game or anyother type of video game?

Because if so I'm getting the game.

Excellent movie though Mattel you make excellent Barbie movies will still keep watching these.",1223251200,4,685,4.3203125

3446260,3,B001A7X0YA,"Really a 3 and a half as far as I am concerned - it is more like Magic of Pegasus than one of the musical's that Barbie has done so well at. My girls and I loved Princess and the Pauper, and the Island one, but this one doesn't really work for me. It is more like Barbie as Rapunzel or Magic of Pegasus - it doesn't have the witty lyrics and great fun the other two musicals have had.

This story takes a long time to set up. First there is Barbie and Theresa who are singing, then Barbie's sister comes in and has had a fight with her best friend, so Barbie tells her the story of Alexa and Liana - best friends. By the time the story of Alexa and Liana begins it is a good way into the movie! It is all about sticking together and working together - as friends you can do anything.

Even once we get the story of these two it takes a while before the real story begins - where Alexa and Liana have to help Melody defeat the evil Muse and return to Diamond Castle for the Magical instruments.

There are two likely lads, but they aren't as mature as they have been in other movies, these are Jack the Lads, with English accents and while they are helpful, they are also somewhat annoying as characters.

It is interesting looking at all the tie in merchandise - most of it has very little to do with the story at all - there are flying horses which come in once when the muses are released - a carriage - used once when the girls return to their home right at the end, the little Kelly characters which turn up briefly at the end for less than 2 minutes - and so on.

This part of the merchandising really peeves me - at least they could be less cynical about selling stuff - incorporate the figures more fully into the story if you are going to flog them off after.

Anyway - it is all right but not fabulous - your little girls will probably like it, but I don't think it will be a family favourite - and take away all the mechandising stuff inside the DVD case before yoru kids start begging for it!",1222905600,4,2003,4.071065989847716

3446263,1,B001A7X0YA,"I am a mom of three girls, ages 1, 3, and 6. We own all the barbie movies of every kind.  Of course we have our favorites.  However this one is very different from the rest for me.  Although it seemed to have a good message in the end, getting there was no fun at all.
1.  The movie starts off with a friend that had a fight and calls her friend a ""backstabber.""  My young girls might have small quarrels with their friends but already this seemed too mature for them.  All they really want is singing and dancing at this age!
2.  Their garden is ruined by a big storm, this threw my 3 year old who is scared of lightning into a tizzy.  Then their house gets burned down.  This happens to be my 6 year olds biggest fear.
3.  They go to a restaurant in a village where everyone is throwing food at each other and yelling.  They get a job singing because the boys who were supposed to show up don't keep there commitment.  The girls hook up with these two ""rascals"" as the movie refers to them.  No thanks.  My girls don't need any help thinking hooking up with guys who are rascals is ok.  By the way my daughters have a very committed stable dad who is always there so this is not from a chip on my shoulder.
5.  At one point one of the girls almost walks off a cliff to her death when she is under the spell of the evil scorcerer. It had a weird feeling because the girl had no control over her self.  Very weird concept for a 3 or 6 year old.
4.  To get to the end where everything ""works out"" you have to go through alot of dark scary scenes where my girls were jumping up and down running around scared.

Having said all of that, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and quite a few other girl movie are not with out their scary, evil moments.

But, this seemed WAY too mature for my girls.  The innuendos and dynamics did not seem to connect with 3, 4, 5,6, or even 7 years olds which is who this is marketed to.
However,the music was fun and my 6 year old LOVES the song connected.

So I wouldn't say, ""DON""T buy this movie.""  That's for evey one to decide on their own.  But I would like to have know about alot of these scenes before hand.  And maybe I would have rented the movie and then been done with it.

What I don't get is little girls at this age only care about the dresses, the music and a cute prince or two.  Why does there have to be so much other stuff?",1222300800,53,2366,4.021459227467811

3446267,3,B001A7X0YA,"We just rented Barbie and the Diamond Castle which my daughter has been eagerly awaiting.  Some items of caution: The two princely characters aren't princes but instead Lotharios.  In the first scene in which they appear, some women in a tavern are mad at them for one-night stands when they expected love.  The men flee and then follow the Barbie girls to try to seduce them.  At first the Barbies don't want to have much to do with them and one says ""you're kidding?!"" when the girl in the mirror says they are desirable, but by the end of the movie they have made friends.  This, in my mind, is way more dangerous than keeping an eye out for an evil villan, and children under eight are pretty incapable of understanding faked emotion in order to manipulate - my daughter thought they were ""bad guys"" until they saved the girls - and then she said, ""oh, maybe they're nice then after all,"" which is the conclusion the movie seems to make, although the girls leave them to go home at the end.  This is right in line with So Sexy So Soon, which I'm reading about marketing sexiness to children to sell products (and age compression means younger and younger kids are targeted).
  And then there's the symbolism that fair is pure and dark is flawed - which maybe I'm particularly bugged by because I'm brunette - but why does it always have to be the darker beauty who is led into temptation and the fair one is virtuous?!  Nothing against being fair, truly it's all beautiful; I would just like a little more randomness to the heroine's traits! (Not that I should expect this in a Barbie movie, but when they marketed they were best friends, dark and fair, I thought perhaps both would equally be heroines and there wouldn't be a ""better"" one!)  Of course it's the reverse with the guys, as if ""dark"" were the only definition of handsome!  We're still a far way from celebrating diversity of all kinds.",1221350400,89,1903,4.518950437317784
3446268,3,B001A7X0YA,"My daughter and I love the Barbie movies. We even have one of the CD's. The animation is always so colorful, and I love the classic style themes of friendship and sacrifice. Diamond Castle has a great premise of loyalty to friends, good verses evil, and even a tame love story. I could do without the modern style music, however. These stories really target little children, and there are already ""older girl"" versions of Barbie. I hope this isn't a new trend for the Barbie princesses. I have been able to recommend these to conservative Christian friends, and I still will but I'd leave this one out. I am overall very please with the Barbie movies and think they are some of the greatest children's shows for ""little princesses"".",1221004800,5,732,4.682170542635659

They especially like the Princess series of movies with great music.  They actually love the classical music as much as the Barbie songs.  Then we got to puff balls and I was disappointed.  Island Princess was better but we hit a real low with Mariposa.

I am pleased very pleased with the Diamond Castle.  The music and story are much better - it reminds me some of the Princess and the Pauper which is one of my favorites.  However there is not as much original music to pull it together.  It is not quite as good as the earlier princess movies but it is so much better than the Fairytopia movies.  It's a good solid movie that my girls will enjoy watching over and over.  It is one that I will be able to watch it with them (unlike the Fairytopia movies).",1220918400,10,927,4.24
