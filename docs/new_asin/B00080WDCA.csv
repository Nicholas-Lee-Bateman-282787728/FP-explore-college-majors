Moving to Northern California as an adult, I found myself amazed by how accessable the coast was! So wonderful to explore. It seemed to stretch on forever. This program  captures the spirit of the California coast and highlights those who are fighting to maintain public access to vast stretches of this beautiful. and valuable resource. This is a program everyone can learn from. Educational and entertaining.  - SS",1123804800,3,554,4.882978723404255
