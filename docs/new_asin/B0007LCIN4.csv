8048147,5,B0007LCIN4,Easy to follow instructions. Very inspiring and fun to just watch. I'm very happy with my purchase.,1425945600,,99,4.882352941176471
8048148,3,B0007LCIN4,"I thought this was a great video, the instructor is clear on what moves you'll be doing. My only problem with the video was the camera work and sound quality. I'm not sure if the camera man was falling asleep, or playing with his new camera or if the editor was acting funky. The camera would sometimes zoom in too closely to the hips or a dancer's face (for example) when the instructor was talking about how the feet should be placed, so you end up missing a portion of the basic footwork. Of course there's room for practice so you eventually get it right, but it is a slight annoyance. The sound quality was also a little off, so the instructor would be yelling the moves while the drums were playing. Or the music would be too loud when the narrator spoke. There's also one part where you can hear the camera man talking which, you get used to but it is distracting the first few times.

Other than that I thought it was a very good instructional/educational video. Sometimes, when you're watching the dancers, they didn't seem coordinated with the instructor so it got confusing at some points but with practice you work out those kinks and it's no big deal. It is a really fun video I just wish the quality of it was a little better and that I had gotten it at a cheaper price. It feels like a video made in the late 80s early 90s!",1391731200,4,1338,4.309523809523809
8048149,4,B0007LCIN4,"I used to be in a Hawaiian/Tahitian dance group a few years ago. I bought similar dvds like this one, mainly for fitness, and to hopefully get my 5 year old daughter interested in dancing.

It's great for beginners, as well as intermediate dancers, for children, and adults. There are about 5 or 6 dances they teach, easy step-by-step, with live music, and a tropical backgound.

8048150,5,B0007LCIN4,I have so much fun with this workout! My friend and I bought cheap Hula skirts at Party City and we have a blast with this dvd! What I love about it is that it's like being in a real class. And it's very challenging! You are going to sweat and your thighs will burn! I wish they'd put out some more dvds!,1325203200,,304,3.8412698412698414

I Love It!... one of my favorite part is they have Live Drummer on Class!. I had a great time learning basic and intermedia steps & moves, also the meanings of hands figures, etc., wow its a good work-out at least I took 2 ltr. of water, even the video looks from 1990's is very very instructional.

8048152,5,B0007LCIN4,"compared to many other forms of dance, there are not as many dvds that feature polynesian styles, especially tahitian dance.  so I am always searching for new ones and am willing to take a chance and buy one I haven't heard about.  I am sooooooo glad I bought this, it is an Authentic tahitian dance class, in studio that takes you beautifully through basic, intermediate, and advanced steps.  the instructor, who is heard on voice over, takes you ""down to the floor"" several times using either the tahitian bump or ami technique.  there is also a chance to practice the duck walk (the move where dancers scoot across the floor in a squatting position, all while continuing to do the tahitian bump.

you wouldnt think after 20 minutes of this you would be sweating, but I bet you will.  there is also another workout section featuring hula, not as intense, and a beautiful demonstration of a couples style hula dance, plus more demos of poi ball.

this is an unknown gem and I hope that riki liufau produces more great dvds!!!",1251417600,19,1026,4.6353591160221
8048153,5,B0007LCIN4,This DVD was the best exercise program I ever spent money on! You will learn all the best authentic moves of the Tahitian dance. Some basics of hula is covered along with the poi balls and fire knife. The Tahitian portion is the longest covered and is very well instructed.,1186617600,12,273,4.48
