5891782,4,B00E5S2HGS,"This is a decent set,half I loved..and the other half I thought was so-so. Still a good buy

-The Outing (1987): full screen, picture looks like a high quality VHS, no extras
It's about a evil genie that gets unleashed and causes rampage. It start off slow but picks up and doesn't stop. My favorite of the set.

-The Vagrant (1992): widescreen,has great picture, no extras
It's about a man moving into a new home but there's a bum that starts to make his life a living hell.
The movie is fun and there's never a dull moment..I enjoyed it a lot.

-What's the Matter with Helen (1971): widescreen, has great picture, no extras
It's about two women who sons go to prison for  murder, the women start to get death threats. So they move to California to
get away from all that. But still this person keeps calling and one of the woman starts to see a man outside of their place.
The movie is a slow burner with a small kill count, I found it not really my cup of tea.

-The Godsend (1980): widescreen, has good picture, no extras
It's about a family who comes across a lost pregnant women so they take her in. She then has the baby at their house then
just vanishes. So they take care of the baby as their own..while it gets older it kills...it's a demon child.
The movie again is a slow burner but it's okay..I wouldn't watch it again.",1382745600,30,1332,4.290836653386454

Don't waste your money on this crap release buy a bootleg someplace because i promise the quality will be better.

5891786,3,B00E5S2HGS,"This is a short and sweet review. 2 movies to a disc, but not as bad as Movies 4 You, which had 4 movies to a disc. ""What's the Matter With Helen"" was already on the Midnite Movie label, and this is just as clear as that. Also, the correct aspect ratio of 1.85:1(IMDB the same). ""The Vagrant"" has its DVD debut, is the correct aspect ratio of 1.85:1(IMDB the same) and the picture looks pretty good, nothing to compare it to.

""The Godsend"" has its DVD debut also, but shows at 1.66:1(IMDB says 2.35:1). The color is pretty good and again, nothing to compare it to. Last is ""The Outing"", also DVD debut(had a DVD Pal) which is shown at 1.37:1 (IMDB says 1.85:1). Color is lousy, picture is dark, blacks blown out, no detail in night scenes, the whole movie is dark. Where did they get this print from, I wonder?

All in all, it didn't rate higher than a 3 star because of 2 movies are not in their correct aspect ratio. One already is in another set and one is a lousy print...but worth the $9 for the 4, but only for the two.",1381881600,12,1026,4.1767676767676765

5891794,5,B00E5S2HGS,"A night in with a bunch of movies I haven't seen before except one. The Outing, I liked it from the first time I seen it on video and being different just left that mark on you. Storyline is great and the acting was fantastic, suspense was chilling so will they survive the night. Okay it's time to tell you a little bit about it, a daughter who's father is in charge of the museum decides to visit there one night with a group of friends, now that said it all doesn't it. People just don't learn or listen but that is our own mistake, now back to the show while they are exploring the museum they come across some new pieces and really don't know how dangerous they are. I liked it as my interest was fixed on the great acting and storyline so I rated this an A grade for the mystery, which is there to catch the unweary and put that tense moment all the way throughout. So time for the movie and relaxation to a classic that will have an impact on you. Enjoy!",1438905600,,961,4.117021276595745
5891795,3,B00E5S2HGS,"Im not going to attempt to give these flicks the scholarly analysis they deserve but I will give a brief rundown of each and scribble whatever pops into mind.

WHATS THE MATTER WITH HELEN?  If you enjoy watching Shelley Winters act the loon then you might want to give this a look. I won't say what it is but its possible Fatal Attraction stole an idea from this film..?  Not exactly captivating but would recommend to fans of strange cinema as a one-timer. Nice ending. FYI: Must avoid the musical numbers. Run far, far away from them. Youve been warned.

THE VAGRANT  I thought I had the whodunit angle figured out but nope I had it all wrong. Dark comedy/satire has its moments but kinda fell apart towards the end. The steamroller lost its momentum and then took a dump without so much as bothering to wipe either.  Definitely worth a look and who knows you might get more out of it than I did.

THE GODSEND  Okay creepy kid award goes to. Believe me any rational adult would throw this little turd off a cliff. Slight riff on The Omen this peculiar little thriller is. Kind of lukewarm, but watch out for a brief but hard-to-forget appearance by Angela Pleasence whom, without much to do here, is still quite chilling in her near-somnambulant role, taking a backseat only to the insanely creepy (when she wants to be) Sheila Keith.

THE OUTING  Evil genie on the loose/dead teenager hybrid, 80s style requisite slasher undertones (or is that overtones); bodycount movie. It does have some cool effects such as the scene where a guy has his head painfully turned all the way around and a cool bitten off fingers/blood-spurt gag. Great tagline  Dont say see you later say goodbye!",1437609600,3,1683,4.614093959731544

5891803,1,B00E5S2HGS,"I often judge a DVD release by the information on the sleeve however this sleeve has little or incorrect information.  The MGM midnight double feature of What's the Matter with Helen? has subtitles. I don't know if any of the 4 movies on the Shout release have subtitles. If so, they don't want to tell you on the sleeve so I expect not.  The Outing is also stated as a 1982 movie. Well it's actually a 1987 movie. These are the mistakes one expects from an Asian bootleg (actually they probably have subtitles).  However the biggest crime is the fact that 2 of these movies (The Godsend and The Outing) are not presented in the original aspect ratio of the theatrical release, I know people will say ""Well at least it's not an Echobridge release"" but seriously is it worth releasing substandard DVDs that are $1-2 cheaper than a proper release? Where does it end! Would you spend $1 for a cooked pizza base because it's cheap! Of course not. You don't want to pay for a gourmet Pizza but you're prepared to pay for more than a base so come on Shout, give us a Pizza that's got all the ingredients yet is still value for money!",1417132800,,1127,4.408653846153846

5891811,3,B00E5S2HGS,"I was very happy to watch this collection. I think all of the movies that are included are worth a watch. I agree that What's the Matter with Helen is a silly addition as it is more of a suspense film. I was pleasantly surprised with The Vagrant. It actually was my favorite movie to watch out of the whole set. The Lamp was the main reason that I purchased the film, and I actually liked it least.

I probably could have enjoyed the lamp more if it hadn't been for the picture distortion. On both Volumes 1 and 2 of the 4 All Night Horror Marathons, every other movie will have the color completely distorted. I'm not referring to aspect ratio or definition. It is like the shades go wonky. On this set, What's the Matter with Helen and The Outing were both heavily distorted that way. I actually returned Volume 1, because of the heavy distortion. Not before watching all the movies first, though!",1399680000,,899,4.4156626506024095

5891813,2,B00E5S2HGS,"This is a decent movie set. The Vagrant , The Outing and The Godsend are good movies. What's the matter with Helen should not be on this set. Just because it deals with crazy people and murder. It does not make it a horror movie. I do recommend this movie set for anyone who likes the genre.",1390694400,2,291,4.12280701754386
5891814,4,B00E5S2HGS,"Scream Factory offers up an entertaining DVD compilation of forgotten and underrated cult classics with its ""4 Movie All Night Horror Marathon"" 2-disc set. The combination is made up of films which span three decades and come in a variety of different levels of quality when it comes to production. It truly is a perfect blend of genre flicks for a fun evening in with friends and family.

1971's ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" is a great thriller that constantly reminds the viewer of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford's ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds take the lead spinster roles that Davis and Crawford made famous and mold them into their own. Two women move to California to get a fresh start after their sons are indicted for murder in their small hometown. Just as they are settling into their new glamorous lives, the past comes back to haunt them in the form or mysterious calls and shadowy figures following them.

""The Vagrant"" stars Bill Paxton in the role of a yuppie that is haunted by a deformed homeless man after he moves into his new house. Talk about a fun 1990's black comedy with some nice thrills and chills. Paxton is fabulous as the anxiety-driven suit being terrorized by the deliciously vile Marshall Bell playing the vagrant.

1980's ""The Godsend"" is the British equivalent of ""The Bad Seed."" It's obviously not as well-executed as the 1958 original, but the creepy little girl (Wilhelmina Green ) causing all the commotion is effective and gives you goose bumps at the proper times throughout its run time. Playing out a bit like ""The Omen,"" the Marlowes adopt the baby girl a strange woman gives birth to in their home. Suspicions arise when the couple's other children begin dying from freak accidents that occur when little Bonnie is around.

""The Outing"" is the edited and shortened version of 1987's ""The Lamp."" Filled with idiotic teens doing even more idiotic things in a closed museum, it revolves around an evil genie released from its bottle to wreak havoc. There are some great scenes in the film, which is basically your typical teen slasher flick with supernatural elements added in. You can't help but feel like this would make a brilliant companion for a double feature with ""Leprechaun.""

All the films included in the ""4 Movie All Night Horror Marathon"" 2-Disc set are rated R except ""What's the Matter with Helen."" The rating is understandable for ""The Vagrant"" and ""The Outing"" as there are some scenes of nudity and gore. However, ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""The Godsend"" are both tame by today's standards and have violence and some language but not much else to find offensive.

Although there's no extras included with ""4 Movie All Night Horror Marathon"" 2-Disc set, it lives up to its name and is worth every penny you'll spend on it. If I were younger and surrounded by genre-loving friends, I could see doing a six hour binge of these movies. There's something in this collection for every type of fan of gore and scares.",1389830400,,3020,4.798076923076923
5891815,4,B00E5S2HGS,"This one surprised the hell out of me because the only reason I heard to own this collection was to get ""The Outing"" (aka The Lamp) on DVD for the first time.  The Outing was without a doubt the weakest movie in this collection!!!!!!!!  On to the individual reviews:

What's the Matter with Helen:  This was quite a bit more watchable than I had really supposed.  I figured I would be in for a slow burner with the ""big shock"" at the end, I was right, but I fully enjoyed the journey there.  Well acted.  4 out of 5.

The Vagrant:  Wow, I can't believe I had never heard of this film.  I was expecting something straight horror, not trippy surrealistic horror.  It's got Bill Paxton (Game Over, Man!!!!!!), the always great Michael Ironside, and Marshall Bell (Kuato's twin brother) as the titular Vagrant.  Definitely a hidden gem.  I was a little torn over the ending though.  4 out of 5.

The Godsend:  Hmmm, I'll say this about this movie; I didn't yawn once, but I was never fully entertained either.  This is your standard creepy kid movie like The Omen.  Thing is The Omen's Damien was actually somewhat unnerving while Godsend's ""Bonnie"" isn't.  Well acted.  3 out of 5.

The Outing:  What a waste of potential.  The genie looked great, a pity it didn't appear till the last 15 minutes of the movie.  When a movie uses possessed people and telekinetically flying objects as the main baddie for most of the film you know you're in trouble.  The weakest of the set.  2 out of 5.",1389484800,2,1484,4.464419475655431
5891816,4,B00E5S2HGS,"Too many reviewers have given you their two cents on the picture and sound, so I'll just put in my say quickly about these films:
""What's the Matter with Helen?"" I understand was added in place of an Italian horror film that was supposed to fill its slot, so I am disappointed that it's included here. However, I probably wouldn't have ordered the ""Who Slew Auntie Roo?"" disc from Midnite Movies either, and the picture/sound is good on this one. A fairly obvious, but creepy, shocker involving a clearly deranged Shelley Winters.
""The Vagrant"" I could not sit through, but I didn't put much effort into it. A silly film from Chris Wallis, whom we should demand more from considering all of his great work on the ""The Fly"" and ""The Fly II."" An idiotic time waster.
""The Godsend""--while I have yet to read the novel that this film is allegedly based upon, I have to say that the film is ripe to be rediscovered by historians. One view posits that the film is boring and pointless, not to mention slow. I think the filmmakers tried to make a serious drama (for the most part) and sold their film as ""horror"" which ultimately did not do the film a service. The performances are interesting, but there is not much else here to recommend the film--""The Bad Seed"" this is not, but I think there may be a more interesting film here than most people have posited.
""The Outing""--Okay, another disappointment. I was hoping for ""The Lamp"" to get a proper, special features-packed U. S. DVD release. What a dreamer, right? If you Wikipedia Warren Chaney you will be floored by the amount of work and productions that this guy has been associated with, and I'm not just talking films/movies. This guy is obviously smart and a hard worker, to put it mildly. However, this junky script is not his best work, and the cast/crew (including Chaney himself) obviously didn't put much thought or effort into the effects or into the (weak) story. For a church-going man of commitment, Chaney's work here is trashy and too much involved with playing to the teen/silly nudity/gory scares crowd. But what upsets me is the lack of story development. Geez. The picture and sound appeared okay to me, but the other complaints on here on not without merit. But apparently ""The Lamp"" is a better edit (not to mention a better film, that allegedly makes more sense) so maybe some day we will get a Warren Chaney film set...won't we? Oh forget it...",1388016000,,2417,4.636363636363637
