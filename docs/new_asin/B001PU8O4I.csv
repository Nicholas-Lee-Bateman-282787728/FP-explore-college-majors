3762143,5,B001PU8O4I,"If you like Dickens or are just curious, try these DVD's. They are done as only the Brits can do them with impeccable acting, right-on characterizations, and attention to historical detail. Great entertainment for the whole family and reasonably priced, too. Highest recommendation.",1273968000,19,282,5.5813953488372094
3762144,5,B001PU8O4I,"The American television network TNT proclaims in its advertisements, ""We know drama,"" but it can't hold a candle to the BBC. Since the sixties, the Beeb has been producing exquisite adaptations of classic literature. These include the plays of Shakepeare, Shaw, and Wilde, the novels of Eliot, Austen, and Trollope, and the works of many other treasures of British and Irish literature, not to mention those of other European nations: Ibsen, Checkhov, Dostoyevsky, and so on.

These productions tend to be simple, elegantly-appointed affairs. There's very little flash, and some viewers may be disappointed by their talky, set-bound nature, yet they are quite faithful to their sources. Performances are uniformly top-notch, often by the most talented and justly famous of British actors: Ben Kingsley, Anthony Hopkins, Judi Dench, Patrick Stewart, John Hurt, Diana Rigg, Rex Harrison, John Gielgud, Joan Plowright, and many more.

This series of Dickens adaptations and its parter, Volume 2, do not utilize thespians especially well-known to Americans (though Ian McKellen, Maggie Smith, Bob Hoskins, and Daniel Radcliffe do star in ""David Copperfield"" on Volume 2), but the acting and direction are excellent.

If you love British literature and history, particularly the Victorian period, you will find these DVD sets to be thoroughgoing treats. They will expose you to dramas both familiar and obscure and will encourage you to delve more deeply into the perennial delight that is Charles Dickens.

Both 2009 sets use slim rather than standard DVD cases, so they are more compact versions of the sets issued in 2005 and 2006, but their contents are identical. They are highly recommended in either form.",1262908800,40,1707,5.33457249070632

I gave it two stars because they are excellent stories just being an older version the story is very long winded, also for some reason the movie kept freezing up.",1387929600,3,231,4.523809523809524
3762182,2,B001PU8O4I,"These DVDs skip and are of low quality.  The productions are Masterpiece Theater and are wonderful, but they are disturbing to watch as they regularly and unexpectedly pixelate, stick or stall, and skip entire parts.

3762184,4,B001PU8O4I,"i would highly recommend this set. i would also warn that it takes some getting used to. Charles Dickens wrote in a style all his own.
while i enjoyed Martin Chuzzlewitt, i found this Oliver Twist version lacking. and i enjoyed Little Dorritt much much more. (it is a different dvd set). while i will keep watching and enjoying this set, i will probably watch Little Dorritt 2 or 3 time more often than this.
Sorry, but that is my honest answer.  and as i said, i really did enjoy Marting Chuzzlewitt (sp?) from this set.

3762195,4,B001PU8O4I,I bought this for my Dad for Christmas.  He is a huge Charles Dickens fan and has all of the movies on tape.  He finally upgraded t.v.s and can no longer use his v.c.r. so I finally upgraded him to DVDs.  This set has a great collection of the classic Dickens movies and is a great gift for fellow Dickens lovers.,1354147200,,313,4.098360655737705
3762196,5,B001PU8O4I,"This box of Dickens dramas is a wonder. My wife and I rate it probably as the best ""literary"" made-for-TV drama series that we've seen yet. Yes, we've both read most of the books, and I've actually lectured on a few of them. But what a treat to see these solid, caring, often imaginative presentations, with fine direction, a few star actors filling key roles, abetted by superb work from the other players. The sets and costumes. too, open up the Dickens world in their own persuasive way. Very rarely do the productions seem narrowly stagy or limited; they have a real movie feel. Could anyone conceivably do these as well as the British, or more specifically the BBC? Hard to believe.

Most of the Dickens novels are big sprawling productions where a great many characters appear, cross paths, and become part of a story that illuminates some key aspects of the social reality of the Victorian Age. The wonder is that, as presented here, the stories also seem very contemporary and relevant. The script-writers are really expert at leaving out certain things in the texts and yet conveying the complexity and sweep of the story. There are so many delicious moments in these shows: Lady Dedlock's confrontations with Tulkinghorn, Tom Pinch's seeing the light about Pecksniff in Martin Chuzzlewit, the wonderful opening of Bleak House where Lizzie helps her father fish corpses from the Thames. Yes, these are not played just as entertainment; there is real darkness here, moral darkness, the darkness of poverty, of narrowness and stupidity, and the filth that accompanied the glitter of Victorian life is not concealed. These are balanced, of course, by the warmth Dickens always generates when things go right, and when good people work together. Compulsive viewing, we found.

I often found that the language of the great Victorian writers was too much for the slick and quick readers among my students. Well, here is a way of tasting something of the Dickens language, of entering the Dickens world, without straining to master the idiom. I'm not advocating that we stop encouraging people to read Dickens, but here is another road to his wonderful world. Those who have read him will enjoy almost all of this, while others may be led into a print-world they will treasure.

One sour note: speaking of language, why does the BBC preface these dramas with such idiotic advertisements for their other productions? These noisy, stupid come-ons are totally out of place and show complete contempt for the (presumably) North American viewers at whom they're directed.",1329004800,9,2568,4.981351981351981
3762197,1,B001PU8O4I,Watch out because the Our Mutual Friend movie only got half way through and then seemed to get stuck and wouldn't go any further. I tried it on 3 different players with the same result.,1325635200,9,185,4.314285714285714
3762198,3,B001PU8O4I,"The disks I did review all worked. Unfortunately, Dickens has to be spread out because going through the full box and all of the films was just a little to dark with their stories. Not horror, but depressing to try and imagine how life was for so many centuries ago.",1320624000,,266,4.34
3762199,2,B001PU8O4I,"The BBC produced this series which means that quality is top-notch. I cannot recommend this item! If you are a die-hard literature buff, this is for you. But I think that people who speak American contemporary English will be hard pressed to overcome the old world British English spoken. It is woven into a thick accent of 1700's - 1800's slang, with the nuances of the Englishes' English. By missing those nuances, the flavor of the times and the meanings are missed. The cover of the DVDs claim closed caption, THEY LIED!!!",1311120000,7,526,4.728260869565218
3762200,5,B001PU8O4I,"I have been deeply impressed with the quality of BBC films which I purchased last month.  Character development is a big plus with me.  Although there is a major plot in each of the Dickens stories, there are also numerous sub plots.  I have ordered additional works presented by BBC and hae enjoyed them all.",1309737600,5,309,4.581818181818182
3762201,1,B001PU8O4I,"I have a large collection of BBC dramatizations of classic English literature and was looking forward very much to the Charles Dickens collection, but when watching Great Expectations I found that episodes froze about 1 to 2 hours into the disk on both sides. I had played the disk on a Sony DVD player and tried playing it on our computer DVD drive with the same result. The video itself was great except for the freezing, which forced us to skip 3 episodes.

I ordered a replacement with the same results. I played Our Mutual Friend with the same result on both the DVD player and computer: episodes froze about 1 to 2 hours into the disk. Episodes earlier and later on the disk played without any problem. I was greatly disappointed and returned the collection for a refund--doubly disappointed because I had looked forward to purchasing volume 2 as well.

I'm curious whether anyone else has had a similar problem with BBC double-sided DVDs. I assume there's an incompatibility between the device used to burn the disks and our Sony DVD player and IBM ThinkCentre M51 DVD drive.

Subsequent to writing the preceding review, I bought the prior version of The Charles Dickens Collection, Volume 1, in which each title is packaged in its own slipcase. The DVD's in that version play without freezing. It was a used box set, but I'm happy to have a fully functioning set of the DVD's. I also have Volume 2 in the slimcase packaging, and those DVD's also play without problem.",1304812800,16,1475,4.687258687258687

3762203,4,B001PU8O4I,I thought all the stories were well done and keep close to the literary companions. The only one that had a hard time holding my interest was Hard Times. I also have vol 2 which so far is fantastic.,1299283200,,198,4.102564102564102
3762204,4,B001PU8O4I,"I see other reviewers have given this set 5 stars. I cannot quite justify 5, overall, which for me, means pretty much everything has to be right. These books on DVDs are fairly true to the Dickens originals. The actors, for the most part, do their jobs well. Of course, Dickens was a genius of a writer, so no complaints with the stories at all. What I found a bit negative, though, are the sets, and at times, the costumes. Even the lighting and cinematography has a rather obvious low budget look about it. Think made-for-TV, then also think low budget, soundstage instead of location, and you will have the idea. These are not bad discs, but just don't expect them to look like Hollywood productions, because they definitely will not. Packaging is nice, with each disc having its own binder.",1299196800,5,794,4.638297872340425

8334812,5,B001PU8O4I,"Highly recommended. These versions were first shown on PBS in the mid-80's and are superior to the adaptations they have shown recently of a couple. (The latest ""Our Mutual Friend"" even gave away the entire surprise in its first five minutes! This one keeps the surprise in its proper place!) The brilliant Tom Wilkinson plays Mr. Pecksniff perfectly in ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" with Paul Schofield. Diana Rigg is tragic and superior in ""Bleak House"" and I'm delighted to find Joan Hickson as Miss Havisham! In an extra on the ""Hard Times"" DVD, this being the only adaptation that is unwatchable...in the extra, is a spooky half hour adaptation of ""The Signalman"" with Denham Elliott, well worth the purchase. The unfortunate policy of Amazon in accepting returns of DVDs only within a month-long period necessitates watching the DVDs quickly---some stories are 8 hours long. I would have preferred not to binge-watch them, and I still have ""Great Expectations"" and ""Oliver Twist""  to go but the month is up today, so hopefully  the discs continue to work.. One, ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" did freeze up and skip; turning the player off and on again seemed to fix that. Excellent production values and adaptations!
I turned off the DVD player and turned it back on, and it worked fine.",1495324800,2,1273,4.971830985915493

8334817,1,B001PU8O4I,"Acting very good, production just fine. I foolishly bought Vols. 1 & 2 at the same time and found , over a period of months, that EACH AND EVERY DVD ON  BOTH VOLUMES HAVE QUALITY ISSUES, CAUSING UNVIEWABLE SECTIONS RANGING FROM A FEW MINUTES TO AS MUCH AS 20 MINUTES. This purchase was, without doubt, the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. Based on many other reviews, this seems to not have been an anomaly.
