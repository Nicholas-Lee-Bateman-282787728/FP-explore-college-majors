5242734,5,B0091Q3254,"Awesome DVD. Great concert at O2 plus bonus features, video trilogy and the acoustic show in Toronto. A must have for a Noel Gallagher fan.",1356998400,,139,4.6
5242735,5,B0091Q3254,"I am reviewing the Blu-Ray version of this disc - my copy says ""made in the EU"" but plays fine on my US blue ray player (i'm not sure if there will be a proper US Release on this title).  The total running time on the BR disc is around 3 hours.  95 min or so for the O2 concert, and an hour and a half of bonus/extras.  The O2 concert is quite good, in hi-def with a decent sound mix; the ""Ride the Tiger"" string-together of videos is in hi-def but only 2.0 sound; the intimate club show is in 2.0 but not high-def (but, is very good nonetheless as it is mostly Oasis tunes) and the NME Show is around 25 min in Hi-def picture, with 2.0 sound.  Most of the key cuts from the NG/HFB album are in the main program, along with some new tunes and some Oasis songs.  I had seen NG/HFB do a 35 minute set at the KROQ Christmas show in 2011 here in LA, and they were very impressive, thus spurring my purchase of this full-length show blu-ray.  I am of the opinion that the Noel-solo album is one of the better things he's done, so i'm very happy to have this show on disc.  There is an additional (CD) disc of stripped down demos of the NG/HFB album (in same order as the actual, plus some extra cuts) included in the blu-ray package i have, so despite the price, you do get quite a bit in the package.",1351987200,10,1296,4.019455252918288

5242737,5,B0091Q3254,"Video editing was very good. Sound was excellent. Top notch band, the addition of the choir on several numbers was very effective and a logistic challenge, no doubt. A great setlist, a combination of older Oasis stuff and NGHFB 1st album, and overall production values make this a worthy addition to anyone's concert library.",1430956800,,325,5.037037037037037
5242738,5,B0091Q3254,A+ seller. I recommend.,1428451200,,23,5.0
5242739,5,B0091Q3254,Two great shows!! Definitely worth every penny. Noel and the crew are great performers and his banter with the audience is classic!!,1426550400,,132,5.045454545454546
5242740,5,B0091Q3254,"A perfect show by an amazing artist. Editing could have been better, but it really doesn't matter as it is Noel Gallagher we're talking about here. What a show!",1423785600,,160,4.551724137931035
5242741,5,B0091Q3254,Awesome! My husband love it!,1414627200,,28,4.8
5242742,5,B0091Q3254,I loved the playlist that also includes a few Oasis songs. Noel is an excellent musician and it's on his great era as solo without his brother Liam.,1394409600,,148,4.321428571428571
5242743,5,B0091Q3254,"I adore all things Noel Gallagher and Oasis. I saw Noel live 3 times on his US tour. He is always great live! So of course, I had to own this. I have already watched it a few times. Put it on as background music while going about the house too. The CD is great too. I love that it is the album demos. You can hear how the songs are different from the album. Work in progress/genius at work!",1393372800,,390,3.8875
5242744,5,B0091Q3254,"It's Noel Gallagher, I get the BD+CD and I give it 5 stars for the BD and the CD is just a plus. The audio disc gives you the original form of the tracks we all now from the debut album. The Blu-ray is Noel and company doing what they do best: art. The BD includes  3 shows, the main show listed on the back of the package and two more shows, one of them doesn't look great because it seems that something went wrong on the production, but still sounds good.

If you are an Oasis fan, buy it, we get classics here with Noel's new band and the new tracks from him.",1388880000,,563,3.9298245614035086
5242745,4,B0091Q3254,What can anybody say negative about Noel Gallagher?  An accomplished professional in the art of entertainment and that he does well in this live concert. No Oasis fan would find anything less than an enjoyable experience with this DVD.,1384473600,,235,5.0256410256410255
5242746,5,B0091Q3254,"This live DVD is the most frequently seen for past one year, and makes me a big fan of Noel Gallagher. For Oasis fans, the last part is for them including the titles like ""Whatever"" and ""Don't look back in anger"". You'll be so happy with it. Really good.",1376956800,,254,4.204081632653061
5242747,5,B0091Q3254,"Not an oasis fan,i learned about Noel through Paul Weller. Took a chance on this dvd and loved it. Only thing lacking is some rapport with audience since what he does say is incomprehensible with his accent. Could have used subtitles. Music is exciting and band is great.",1371945600,,271,4.666666666666667
5242748,4,B0091Q3254,"It is a good performance, maybe not the best I think there was a need of more energy and power.",1371427200,,95,3.8
5242749,3,B0091Q3254,The audio was average at best.  Actually sounds a little fuzzy. A big minus on my system.  Enjoyed the performance though.,1370304000,,122,4.761904761904762
5242750,5,B0091Q3254,Any fan of Oasis will love the shows and demos. The O2 show reminded me of the great show I saw @ the Academy of Music in Philadelphia.,1369267200,,135,3.857142857142857
5242751,3,B0091Q3254,"This review is for the first disk only, if the second one is anything like the first then I don't even know if I'll want to watch. It's a VERY artsy fartsy looking DVD. With the annoying little ""old timey film"" edits. You know, where the picture moves up and down horizontally til it ""calms down"", as well as the writing with the song title as if it's a rough edit. Plus every few songs or so, they interrupt the show to show Noel and co. out and about signing autographs and or looking at pyramids etc. I don't mind seeing that, so long as it's at the beginning of the show or even after. But during??? Way to break up the momentum of the show. Also, the song Supersonic (one of my fav. songs) is in black & white. Maybe it's just me but I've NEVER been to a live show and seen any of that stuff. Then the crowd shots, yeah what I want to see is the back of some random woman dancing in the bloody nose section, not even seeing the band. Is it really THAT hard to make a concert DVD? Get a camera, put it in front of the stage so you can see the entire band, and you leave it there. No edits. Leave the screw ups, the banter, everything in. That to me would be PERFECT. I guess that's too difficult to do with all this new technology. I'm sure glad I only paid $3 for this.",1367625600,4,1274,4.0
5242752,5,B0091Q3254,"Being an Oasis fan, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds is definitely up to par with Noel's legacy. My fiancee and I even drove from Houston, TX to Atlanta, GA to have the experience of seeing NGHFB live and it was well worth the trip. I never had the chance to see Oasis live so this was a very close second. When I read that this DVD was going to be released and have all the extras such as the ""Ride the Tiger"" video trilogy, and demos for every track from the album plus ""The Good Rebel,"" ""I'd Pick You Every Time,"" and ""Freaky Teeth,"" I knew I had to have it in my collection. My fiancee is also just as huge of a NGHFB and Oasis fan as I am (if not more), so I got this for her for Valentine's Day.  We both watched it that night and enjoyed every second of it. I even had the demo CD in my car for a couple weeks. For any Oasis/NGHFB fan, this is a must-have!",1363392000,3,865,3.942857142857143

5242755,5,B0091Q3254,Noel Gallagher is the greatest song writer ever....he deserves my money and yours. You know he does and his music is amazing!,1357516800,,125,4.7272727272727275

8534410,5,B0091Q3254,"Warning: the jump cuts are annoying as hell but, everything else is top notch.  This is not Oasis.  Clearly not.  But, it's a hot s*&t band in top form busting out Noel's best writing and the small one himself is in fine vocal form.  If you want to know who won the punch up between Beady Eye and High Flying Birds, look no further.  But, every single DVD of Oasis is better IMHO.  Especially Lord Don't Slow Me Down followed by the Definitely Maybe DVD.  Worth looking out for and picking up.",1457654400,,493,4.293478260869565
