2992489,5,B000WW1YOW,"I love how the authors have us rooting for Light the entire series.  It's amazing.  I only watch this anime and Bleach, and Death Note is now one of my favorite shows of all time.  Suspenseful, thoughtful, and things actually happen (main characters are not immune to being killed).  I'd suggest watching it from the beginning, but I had a friend start watching it in the middle of the series and she was hooked half way through the first episode she watched.  Even if you don't like anime or other Adult Swim shows, you will love Death Note.",1214352000,,542,4.489795918367347
2992490,5,B000WW1YOW,"Since I first saw this on Adultswim I became completely captivated by this new import from Japan. I have bought all the current English dubbed dvds and this series has now become my favorite anime. This series has intrigue, suspense, supernatural elements including horror. A very faithful adaptation of the hit manga series.",1210636800,,325,5.150943396226415
2992491,5,B000WW1YOW,"It is definitely worth owning this entire sereies.  I have watched it all, and me as well as many top review sites can put this series in the top 5 anime out there.

I say this for those who were like me and couldn't wait for the rest, go to youtube and type the deathnote ep (insert # here).  33 episodes are uploaded so far.  for the rest, just got to google video and find them.  Enjoy.",1209859200,,389,4.0
2992492,5,B000WW1YOW,This show will keep you involved an in suspense the whole time you watch. I recommend getting this. I wish that Naruto would come out as fast as this show because it is up there with Death Note. I am going to keep on getting all the episodes that comes out. This is as addicting as Heroes.,1208736000,,289,4.087719298245614
2992493,4,B000WW1YOW,"I have read the whole Manga series and my wife didn't. We both enjoy watching the Anime together. The Anime stays faithful to the Manga story. The plot gets more complicated and interesting by 10 folds. She is really getting sucked in the story as Light & L battle wits.
The enclosed mini L statue is plasticy and nothing too excited. I wouldn't buy it on its own. But for a few bucks along with the DVD, it isn't bad and L crouches happily on top of our TV. You may want to concider the regular edition without the statue.
What I hate about the series is the English dubbing, which quite lame, but not bad. The extras are nothing to be excited about, so I subtracted a star for the cons I mentioned. Otherwise, it is a must buy.",1207699200,,729,4.214285714285714
2992494,4,B000WW1YOW,"If you've seen volumes one and two, you know what to expect: the same eerieness tinged with irreverance combined with excellent animation that makes this series one of the better ones to visit the States in some time.  Some pretty big revelations go down in this volume and one wonders how or where they can go with the story.  Anyway, worth your dollars!",1207526400,,355,4.619047619047619
2992495,5,B000WW1YOW,"This dvd has some great episodes, and many important things happen during them. I am not gonna spoil anything, but if youve kept up with the series so far on Adult Swim, then you know that this release will be good.",1206921600,,215,4.2682926829268295
2992496,5,B000WW1YOW,"This is where the show starts to get even more interesting.  We find the character Light continuing to play the role of ""god of the new world,"" ending the lives of the people he deems evil and unworthy of life.  Light continues to write names in the Death Note, with the genius detective L hot on his trail.  Light stays sharp so that he can eliminate L, keep his grades up, and keep Ryuk from going into withdrawal by feeding him apples.  The show begins to start getting much more interesting in Volume 3 with Light entering college and L begins to keep an even closer watch on Light.  More importantly, the revelation of another Death God coming to Earth with a second Death Note.  The Death God not only gives the second Kira a Death Note, but they also provide a nice pair of Shinigami eyes to the owner allowing them to see everyone's name and lifespan by just looking at their face.  What will this mean for Light?",1201737600,5,921,4.382352941176471
2992497,5,B000WW1YOW,Death Note is the most amazing manga/anime series...all manga/anime fans should own this. I adore the Mello figurine too.,1254355200,,121,5.421052631578948
2992498,3,B000WW1YOW,DEATHNOTE WAS GREAT UNTIL L DIED. THE SERIES SHOULD HAVE ENDED WITH LIGHT WINNING. AT LEAST THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT THE CRAP DUO THAT IS MELLOW AND NEAR.,1243814400,2,162,4.433333333333334
2992499,5,B000WW1YOW,"Death Note vol. 6, Great Quality, I've had no problems in video frame being slow or skipping. The Series itself is clinching, I strongly advise to watch them in order for spoilers are in this one and others. Quite basically what the main plot boils to is that a young boy named Light, picks up a Notebook, whoever name he writes in it with the picture of him/her's face in his mind, dies. He has many people attempting to hunt him down, but only a select few show great difficulty towards his goal. He meet's a few friends to help him along the way, Some are quite normal while others are abit more...out there. If you have never watched anime before this is a great one to start out with.",1243641600,,689,4.3076923076923075
2992500,5,B000WW1YOW,Death Note is truly a well written and mind thinking anime for people of many ages.  Just when one may think you know where the story maybe going there is a twist in the story line.  I would also highly suggest the Death Note books.,1230336000,4,232,4.133333333333334
2992501,4,B000WW1YOW,"The series is great and a good way to practice listening comprehension with Japanese as well as be entertained. It is a dark series, but for those that like murder mystery, suspense, and horror, it is a great watch.",1230076800,,215,4.538461538461538
2992502,5,B000WW1YOW,"There is thus far nothing wrong in my world regarding Death Note, including the more recent attempts at beating a dead horse with a stick with the live-action ""L-change the WorLd"" and the BB murders novel.  The only disappointing thing for me was the decision to not include L's successors in the live-action Death Note movies (though there is a vague nod to Near at the end of ""L-change the WorLd"").  Considering that the original manga is really an extremely convoluted mind-game of chess, where there are more thought bubbles than speech bubbles, it's amazing that they were able to pull off fantastically the first two live action movies albeit in a truncated form.

More amazing is that the anime version manages to keep the manga's mind games nearly whole.  Unlike most people, I find the characters of L's successors, Mello, and especially Near, not to mention the background of all three young men being orphans raised in a home full of brilliant children for the express purpose of picking certain of them for duties such as L, aka the Whammy House, to be much more interesting.  Particularly in the fact of their different approaches from L, their similarities and drive to beat each other to avenging L and to end the reign of Kira - all while Mello does so with a dark, passionate drive and seeming hatred of Near and his passive, painstaking method.  In a way seeing how Mello and Near interact gives you more of a perspective of L's background than watching L himself for a majority of the series.

Basically, if you've made it this far through my review I'm surprised you haven't already hit the 'One-Click' buy button.  This is the point of the anime where you go from the long, steady, plodding pace of Death Note to the beginning of the brawling, psychotic stampede to the end of the series.",1229990400,3,1809,4.684542586750789

2992504,5,B000WW1YOW,"Honestly, this is one of the best tv series ever simply because of the mental part of it.  There isn't so much action in the sense of people fighting.  It's all about the mental warfare.  This series will keep you guessing what is going to happen inbetween each episode and as you're watching the episode itself.  This is something that everybody and anybody should watch at least once through.

The Bad Part:  It technically ended with the resolution at the end of the first ""season"".  You can tell what part I'm talking about when you see it.  Then because the fans loved it so much and they pressured him, he went about making a second ""season"".  Think of it really being two books in the set.  The second set of episodes takes some episodes to really get along.  He had to take it slow to keep the human reactions in the show realistic as opposed to them ""magically"" figuring somthing out or slipping up.  So that's it's only real downside.

There is one other part I don't particularly care for, but I can't say because it's a spoiler.  If you enjoy the series, you'll know instantly what part I mean when you see it. ;)",1219536000,,1125,4.424390243902439
