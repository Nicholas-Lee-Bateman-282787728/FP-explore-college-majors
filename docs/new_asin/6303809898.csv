I can't even figure out why they named it Solar Force. They could have named it Spazmatrons from the Moon and it would have been a better title. At least that would make a little more sense. Nothing about it was either original or compelling. Solar Force's only value is maybe for camp... that is if you call lame movies campy.

Where do I even start? First off the story looks like someone just got the Big Book of Clich Science Fiction, opened a random page, closed their eyes and put their finger on some part of the book and said, ""Lets put that in"" then repeated the process. I see stuff taken from Terminator, Mad Max, and about a  dozen B-Movies. Sad thing is the plot doesn't really fit any of these tidbits right. They throw just about all the clichs they can and just when you thought it was safe, they throw some even lamer clichs out. The plot unfolds almost as if the writers had a short attention span. There is no cohesion.

When was the last time you watched a fight scene in a movie and were looking at your watch wondering when it would be over? Look no further. They must have had such a small budget they couldn't hire a fight choreographer. Funny how action scenes feel like they actually slow down the movie. The soundtrack is just as bad. For instance every time the leading lady comes into a scene this music comes into play that I can only describe as a mix between light calypso and turning the crank on a Jack-in-the-Box really slow. About the only scene that actually found some heart in was the result of the absolute worst plot twist in the entire movie. I don't think it was worth the wait.

Solar Force was a bad idea that was executed just as bad. I can't find anything redeeming about this movie aside for the fact that it really amused me on how bad it was. That is the only way I can recommend anyone seeing this movie. If you have a group of friends who like to take shots ala MST3000 then party on and rent this puppy. Everyone else just wait until you can see in some form where you don't have to pay for it and prepare to be disappointed.",1158278400,,2254,4.2227378190255225
7854064,3,6303809898,"I am a big fan of Michael Pare, as well of biker movies.  This movie combines almost all of the qualities that make a good sci-fi adventure movie a classic.  I has a likeable hero, two love-to-hate villians, and an enjoyable, developed plot all the way through.  Unfortunatley, where this film lacks is in teh musical score.  The same annoying song is used over and over again, and oftentimes the music doesn't really seem to fit the action.  This film might actually be made better with no music at all, such is the extent to which the music ruins the movie, depriving it of a deserved five-star rating.",1068249600,2,604,4.555555555555555
7854065,1,6303809898,"If you love horrible special effects and bad acting that ISN'T humorous, then this movie is for you.  Also, this movie is for those who don't want to be surprised.  I had everything figured out about 10 minutes before it happened.  In a nutshell: THIS MOVIE BLOWS!",1002931200,2,264,4.574468085106383
7854066,2,6303809898,"For Billy Drago (Diplomatic Immunity) fans this is not an example of his best work but if you collect his movies, add it. The storyline is okay and Michael Pare (appearing with Mr. Drago again in Deadly Heros) is good in his role as a motorcycle-riding lunar cop from the future. For Drago fans though, Mr. Drago is the bad guy as usual but he uses a lot of profanity which is really not his style. As a psycho biker, Drago's role could have been developed more to give Pare a much better advisary. A good portrayal in the movie is done by Robin Smith (Never Say Die). He's an android from hell sent to finish up what Pare doesn't. Still, this movie is worth a look for any sci-fi lover.",990662400,,687,4.251908396946565
