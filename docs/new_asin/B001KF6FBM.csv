3665684,5,B001KF6FBM,"I'd never seen ""La Cenerentola"" before, but Rossini is always a pleasure.  The pace of the dialog and story are fetching and the stepfather looked and acted appropriately dissipated for one who squandered the family's wealth.  I'd like to see other productions in the future.",1435017600,2,275,5.088888888888889
3665685,5,B001KF6FBM,"Just recently got into opera and this was easily one of the best Ive seen. The story of Cinderella is always told like it is a sad story, but they brought out the humor in it. I would love to have seen it live.",1433116800,,210,3.7954545454545454
3665686,4,B001KF6FBM,"I have been more thqn pleased with the majority of my purchases.  My biggest disappointment was Donizetti's Linda de Chamounix.
First it took a long time to receive the cd and when I did, one disc was missing so I had to return it.  Meanwhile it cost me $7.00 to return it and I do not know if it was received or not, nor do I know if I got a refund or not.  I really enjoyed the opera and would have liked to  have it but after all the fuss, I doubt that I will order again.  This was really the first time Amazon  let me down.",1415404800,,528,3.8425925925925926

3665688,5,B001KF6FBM,"There are some operas, gentle reader, that justify multiple DVD performances to experience the work with different performers and conductors. Cenerentola is one of them (others include Elisir, Traviata, Lucia and Boheme). This one supplements, but does not necessarily excel the versions starring Elina Garanca, Joyce DiDonato, Cecilia Bartoli or Frederica Von Stade. It is surprising how one's perspective changes with the performance, but if the budget can only handle one, this one will delight.

I was totally unfamiliar with Ruxandra Donose, but hope that more recordings will issue. She has a rich yet supple mezzo that makes the fiendish Rossini coloratura seem easy. She has exceptional stage presence and really does a first rate job with this challenging piece

Maxim Miranov is another ""joy to enjoy""; he was (and is) a few years younger than Juan Diego Florez in 2005 but has the light and supple voice that should produce many years of enjoyment, assuming that the current trend for Rossini continues. He can also be heard in a DVD of L'Italiana In Algerie. He, too has good stage presence, even at this early (2005) stage in his career.

Luciano Di Pasquale is a Don Magnifico to dislike: he is unshaven and wears a shirt that looks like it has not been washed since it was purchased! Musically and dramtically excellent, Di Pasqualr creates a character that is frequently despicable. But the wine cellar scene is priceless.

Similar kudos to Simone Alberghini (Dandino) and Nathan Berg (Alidoro).

One aspect that makes this performance work so well is Maestro Vladimir Jurowski in the pit. I had not heard him conduct before, but as a then young conductor, he had a real feel for the inticate music of Rossini.

Disc quality is excellent both as to picture and sound, with the DTS surround giving a real sense of the Glydebourne house.

In sum a dandy performance of a favorite opera.",1364428800,2,1900,4.93730407523511
3665689,5,B001KF6FBM,"If you're looking for a CENERENTOLA with substance, this is it.  Briefly, a list of what you will not see here: giant rats, giant wedding cakes, flying donkeys, angels, overdone slapstick, references to Rene Magritte, or any of the other ""cute"" gimmicks of other recent productions of this opera.  What you will see: a handsome, historically appropriate staging which places the opera squarely where it belongs, in the age of Lord Byron and Jane Austen (like Austen's novels, the opera deals with social advancement through marriage).  In the hands of director Peter Hall, the opera is not a fairy tale but a human drama.  What he has created is a thoughtful, elegant production that is more than a little ""English"" in feel; even the English subtitles are literate.

That there are no verifiable ""stars"" in the cast is of no consequence; the musical values of this production couldn't be higher.  Ruxandra Donose's Angelina is a woman of spunk and spirit, not at all meek or submissive.  Her sad little song in the first scene seems like an attempt at one-upmanship towards her stepsisters; by opera's end, Donose is spouting her coloratura with total ease and no hint of the aspiration we sometimes hear in this sort of vocal writing.  The plainness and modesty of Donose's bearing makes Angelina's transformation into a princess all the more wonderful to behold.  Maxim Mironov, the Don Ramiro, is a true Rossini tenor - light, sweet, and agile, able to etch his coloratura with exactitude.  His one weak point is a lack of authority or true anger in his denouncing of Angelina's family in the Second Act Sextet; Mironov is a boyish and not very imposing presence.  Simone Alberghini, looking like a suitor in a Jane Austen novel, is so charming and debonair a Dandini that for once one can understand the passions at stake as the stepsisters vie for him.  A true dark bass-baritone, he is ideal for the role in looks and gesture, and he brings depth to the role: one senses Dandini's bitterness at being rejected by Angelina in favor of Ramiro and at having finally to ""unmask"" himself as the valet.  Nathan Berg plays the prince's mentor Alidoro (here presented as an Enlightenment-like philosophe) as a man possessed by a moral message; possessed of a velvety bass voice with spectacular coloratura, Berg delivers his aria like a wild-eyed prophet.  Among the stepsisters, Lucia Cirillo stands out for her believable, well-acted (and non-ugly) Tisbe.  My least favorite member of the cast is Luciano di Pasquale, the Don Magnifico.  Fully behind Peter Hall's concept, di Pasquale creates an uncouth, loutish, even repulsive character (and spits out his patter to percussive effect).  But like Ebeneezer Scrooge, Don Magnifico needs some endearing quality to make the final reconciliation believable, and this di Pasquale does not provide.  Di Pasquale has quite a lovely bass voice, but at times he uses it like a bulldozer.

If you're used to hearing CENERENTOLA's orchestral score rendered as pretty wallpaper music, then brace yourself for Vladimir Jurowski's assertive and dramatic interpretation.  The sounds which emanate from the London Symphony on this occasion are reminiscent of the best period-instrument orchestras, partly due to their use of just intonation and valveless brass instruments, which add a certain bright abraisiveness.  The orchestra is an unapologetic participant in the opera, and Jurowski gets every bit of ""meat"" from the score. (And the fortepiano's comic ""asides"" in the recitatives are a delight.)

CENERENTOLA has several classic Rossinian ""confusion ensembles"", and Peter Hall's staging of them is apt, keeping in mind the doom and panic which the text portends: characters crawl, weave, ""swim"" in slow motion, or simply sink to the ground in despair.  And I liked that this production leaves no doubt that there is a whole bevy of guests at the Prince's ball, not just the Don and his stepdaughters.

In short, this is a brilliant CENERENTOLA - full of wit, intelligence, and musical excellence.  Viewers wanting an ""all-star"" cast will probably look elsewhere; for a dead-on interpretation of the opera's spirit, this is the version to own.",1262044800,8,4183,5.080409356725146
3665690,5,B001KF6FBM,"This Glyndebourne Opera production from 2005 is one of the best opera DVDs I own. I was surprised that there was not a single performer who was familiar to me. Perhaps the members of the cast specialize in Rossini, such is their mastery of his music. Everyone excels, making this production a complete delight. In addition, the directing is crisp, the costumes and sets look great on an HDTV. A splendid production all around.",1246924800,2,426,4.77027027027027
