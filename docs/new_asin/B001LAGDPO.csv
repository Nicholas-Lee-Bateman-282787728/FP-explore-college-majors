I couldn't care less about the quality of sound & video. Yes, it is not in its best, yes it is not even 5.1 Surround (it is 2.0 Stereo) but it never bothers you when it is Clash, while they're pouring their soul out on stage with their glorious London Calling/pre-Sandinista era. You can feel that they are in complete control and really enjoying it. And they are with the audience that they're always in love with, small room of full crowded people, you can really feel the spirit.

It is well worth the price considering other lousy band concerts, needs to be in every true fans or even every decent music lovers' collection. Non-stop 43 minutes of the Clash, all grown up but still too young, who could ask more...",1366502400,2,988,4.364130434782608
8317746,5,B001LAGDPO,"This is the Clash at the height of their powers, post-London Calling, giving it their all, with everything to lose. It's actually a punk era rock n' roll performance if you think about it. Joe's not suffering hepatitus; his voice is in fine ruff form. Mick isn't whacked on guitar effects and blow; he hits the notes spot on. Paul has increased his skill and is now really a bass player, And Topper hasn't fallen under the spell of heroin. The addition of the keyboardist fr Ian Dury & the Blockheads is good and yet not in the way. They may be having all the other problems that many bands have but they were, without a doubt, transcending them. Last but not least- if you want to watch it on your dvd player- i was told that you could download it to your computer and then rip a copy of that. Yes, some quality may dwindle (negligable i'm sure) but you could then see it on the big tv screen. I'm lazy and still just watch it on the computer.

And as to the other reviewer giving it only 2 stars i'd have to disagree big time. Full concert footage of the Clash is tough to find. Take what you can get, and this is it!",1345593600,2,1119,4.180555555555555
8317747,2,B001LAGDPO,"Truthfully, the recording quality of this is poor. The vocal mix is terrible and the instruments seem to be in and out at times. If you are looking for a good quality DVD to see one of the best live bands of all time, this is not it. The guys also seem to be a bit tired and worn out. I also am only able to watch this DVD on my PC; my DVD player does not recognize it. This problem may be because of the PAL/Region 0 coding. I can't totally knock this DVD since any chance to see the Clash live is truly a blessing in itself. Sorry to have to report this.",1238371200,21,556,3.8434782608695652
