Al and Marcia demonstrate the steps individually and then put it together so you know what it's supposed to look like.  Then you can go back and practice right along with them in the comfort of your own home.  Before you know it you'll have the confidence to get up on the dance floor and have a great time dancing the night away. It doesn't matter if your learning alone or with a partner, you'll quickly catch on to the steps.",1157760000,10,527,4.147058823529412
