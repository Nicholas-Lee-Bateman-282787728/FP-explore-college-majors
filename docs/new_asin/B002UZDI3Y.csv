3993802,5,B002UZDI3Y,"This is a great DVD.  I bought it particularly to share with my grandchildren, but I find it to be a good workout for myself.  The simple follow along workouts for calisthenics and the blocks and punches really keep the kids interested.  The cartoon segway is also an added plus for a little more enjoyment. These instructors are to be complimented for their ability to really get down to a kid's level and at the same time offering good, solid instruction in Kung Fu.  There is a lot of discipline to be learned here.  Looking forward to another good DVD from YMAA.",1266192000,2,566,4.509803921568627
3993803,5,B002UZDI3Y,"Kung Fu for Kids was just the right DVD to send to my grandchildren in Florida. First, they watched it intently. Then they watched it and also tried out the movements. After a few more times they had it almost memorized. Still, they continue to enjoy watching and working out with this DVD. Not only is this a good way to strengthen young muscles, but it is also excellent for coordination. My son frequently works out along with his children. As another reviewer noted, this DVD is not just for kids!",1266105600,,501,4.516483516483516
3993804,5,B002UZDI3Y,"Kung Fu for Kids is a video designed for kids, just as mom or dad may use a yoga video for daily exercise.  Regardless of style of kung fu practiced any student, soon-to-be student, or beginner student will recognize all of the basic stances, punches, kicks, and blocks covered in this DVD.  Even parents considering sending the kids off to the local martial arts school may find value in using the video to allow their children to explore and experience basic training before signing a contract only to find out that the kiddo hates class.

This DVD begins with simple follow-along workouts, including warm-ups, basic stances, blocks, and punches and kicks.  Sprinkled throughout are tips that will help the practitioner develop balance, breathing, and mental focus.  The instructor and senior students demonstrate the techniques movement-by-movement for better understanding and learning of the postures, blocks, punches and kicks included in the workout.  Towards the end, Dr. Yang explains some simple symbology, Nicholas Yang provides a testimonial to the practice of traditional Chinese martial arts, and Ben Warner speaks about the benefits of working with children.  Lastly, parent testimonials attest to the benefits of martial arts training.

As a kung fu instructor, I find that often times children can be overwhelmed by the number of postures, kicks, punches, etc., not even considering if chinese names are used.  This DVD allowed me to see how YMAA approaches the instruction of children in a format that is not overly rigorous, yet focused on critical basic skills.  With that in mind, I am certain that any instructor may find benefits or ideas from the approach demonstrated in the video.

Finally, there is no reason why this video should be considered ""for kids only.""  This video could be used as a daily workout video for any adult student.  The workout presented is physical training in of itself, similar to the one I use as conditioning in my dojo.  If the viewer watches closely, you will notice that the instructor Ben Warner himself sometimes struggles with catching his breath from the calisthenic workout!",1266105600,,2135,5.132947976878612

3993846,4,B002UZDI3Y,"My 6 1/2 year old just started Kung Fu classes about a month ago and loves it.  Since it is only twice a week I wanted to give him a chance to work on his skills while he is at home during the days he has no class.  This is a wonderful way for him to do so. The teacher explains the moves in a way that a child can comprehend and follow along.  The segments aren't excessively long for the beginner and they offer a breather with the little animated star doing a small sampling of what is to come in between.  I love the section that talks about the moral aspects of martial arts and I think it will be helpful in reminding my son that his Kung Fu practice should be incorporated into other aspects of his life, not just for physical skills and ""becoming a ninja"" as is probably the motivation for many small children who develop interest in the martial arts.  I do feel that the parent and instructor comments later in the video should have been kept a little more brief as they will probably only be viewed one time and never again, but it is good that that segment was after the workout so it's easy to turn it off at the appropriate time.  I suppose it does lead a person to believe the part for their kid's is longer than it actually is if one looks at the running time as a factor in one's purchase decision.  I'd have rated it with 5 stars if it hadn't been for that.",1336089600,,1374,4.104477611940299

3993852,5,B002UZDI3Y,"As a classroom teacher, I whole-heartedly recommend this DVD. You cannot go wrong with this one whether you buy it for yourself, your kids, your grandkids, or especially for the classroom.

I set aside 15-20 minutes daily in the morning for physical exercise with my second graders. While the weather is good, we walk the track, but during the winter, I have to get creative. This DVD was perfect!!The kids loved it! They were so energized and ready for the day not to mention that it helped increase self-confidence for some of my kids. They just felt so ""cool.""

Kung Fu for Kids breaks each exercise down into bite-size chunks and so that even those who can't chew gum and walk at the same time (me) will be able to follow the step-by-step instructions. After the easy to understand instructions, there is a full round of workout with that particular move. You choose the area you want to work on whether it's punches, kicks, etc.

I especially liked the cultural notes included at the end of the DVD. The fact that youths are the Kung Fu models make it all the more appealing and doable.

The kids also loved the graphics and would ask to do a workout with the Kung Fu star graphic. Crazy, but funny.

If you have any doubts about getting this, just know this, it will be money well-spent, get it!!",1280966400,,1302,4.523404255319149

3993855,5,B002UZDI3Y,"This is a great workout dvd for all the little kids that just came from the movies watching ""The Karate Kid"". This is real Kung Fu taught by real teachers. Kids love to punch and kick, jump and block. My small granddaughter came into the room as I was watching this DVD and she was able to follow right along. She is only four, but I teach taiji in my dojo so she is familiar with some of the movements. It was a workout for me too! She followed along the entire first set where the kids were practicing routines and lost interest at the end of the series where senior student were given corrections and instruction.

This will be a wonderful introduction to the basics of kung fu for those millions of kids who will go to the movies and want to be the next Master. I would think it work work really well for kids in the elementary school grades.

The only technical flaw that I saw was the instructor placed himself in the middle of the group of children in the first section of the dvd. This caused the two young kids in the front to have to turn their heads to look at him in order to follow along. It threw them off balance.

Buy this for your young kids and grand kids and then do it with them! No more couch potatoes!",1276473600,2,1223,4.151898734177215
3993856,5,B002UZDI3Y,"This video really has two distinct parts.  The first 30-40 minutes of the DVD works quite well by itself as a fun kids' program that is something of a combination between an exercise video and the type of live action show that you might find on Nick Jr. or PBS.  The host, Ben Warner, has a fun-loving, kid-friendly attitude, a quality required in any good children's show host.  Plus, the program is fast-paced, exciting, and even has animated breaks between sections featuring a Kung Fu Star that performs the techniques to be practiced next, a feature that's sure to be a hit with the younger set.  The instructor also brings in some moral and ethical lessons to help lead children down the path to better behavior, and at the end of this first portion of the video, they even focus on the kids, giving each of them the chance to be in front of the camera and talk about what they like best about Kung Fu.  This is a segment that would not be out of place on any episode of Sesame Street.  Honestly, I could easily see the first part of this video as a template for an ongoing television series designed to get kids moving.

After this first portion, the video then goes back through the techniques, using two of the more advanced students to demonstrate, and discusses each of them in more detail.  This is a nice opportunity for older viewers to learn more about the techniques and how to perform them properly.  Finally, the video ends with a series of testimonials from instructors and parents that describe how martial arts training can lead to positive development in children.  Presumably, this was done to convince wary parents that practicing Kung Fu will not turn their children into bullies.  However, I have to say that this is probably the weakest portion of the video, as it seems to go on for too long.  It is at the end, though, so it is easy to simply stop the DVD before you reach this section.  As a result, it in no way detracts from the value of the video.

I also want to add that the target audience of this video is kids.  If you are an instructor looking for ideas to enhance a children's class, this is probably not the best place to go.  Not that it is without value in this regard, but rather, this is simply not the purpose of the video.  As such, instructors looking for program-enhancing knowledge are likely to be disappointed by the content.

This video is not for instructors, though.  It's for kids.  And as a video for kids, I give it top marks.  It's fresh, fun, entertaining, and was able to keep my youngest son enthralled for a good 20-30 minutes.  Not bad considering that he's not yet even two years old.",1275782400,13,2649,4.475
3993857,5,B002UZDI3Y,"My six-year-old daughter found this DVD on my desk and asked if she could do it. She knew immediately what it was just from the cover, and thought it looked like fun. I popped it in the DVD player, and let her go at it while I watched from the couch. My daughter kept with it the entire time. There are some animated segments between instructional pieces that add to the childlike nature of what they're doing, and it helped to really keep her attention on the material. There were no slow points, no time wasted on lengthy descriptions of things a kid really doesn't care about.

The video moves quickly through the material, keeping kids' attention focused on what they're doing. There is very little emphasis on HOW to do what they're doing, but if your kid does this for a few days a week, they'll be doing it right without thinking too heavily on it. Even if your kid doesn't learn a martial art from this (and they probably won't), it'll get them off the couch and doing something fun and worthwhile.

The production values of this DVD were actually better than I expected. The instructor is very comfortable and familiar with teaching kids, and it shows. The instruction, lighting, clarity, and pacing of the video was excellent.

I would recommend this video to anyone with young kids.",1273536000,,1293,4.613043478260869
3993858,4,B002UZDI3Y,"I just finished watching ""Kung Fu for Kids: A Fun Workout for Kids with Training Tips for Students, Parents, and Teachers"" with Nicholas Yang and Ben Warner.  It's a good program aimed at kids, and I did find that it gave me some ideas for when I teach younger students as well.  I believe there are many positive things training in martial arts can provide youth, so I applaud all efforts to help younger people remain focused on positive activities, especially martial arts.

The Training Workout portion of the DVD is a follow along with the DVD workout led by Warner.  Warner does not ""teach"" the movements in this section, he just has the viewer follow along in this training workout section.  Nicholas Yang moves around and assists the students as Warner continues leading the group.  The Detail Section provides guidance on how to perform the movements included in the workout portion.

The DVD begins with the Training Workout that includes a short introduction by Warner explaining the meaning of Kung Fu, and that he will be teaching Long Fist Kung Fu on this program.  There are then some safety measures to follow.  Then Warner leads a group of eight kids in a simple warm up that kids can follow along with.

Next comes the run and jump where Warner leads the group with jogging in place and a series of hops and other movements and exercises to get the blood circulating.  Kids will probably have fun with this jumping as well as the animal movements. These two warm up sections end around the 14-minute mark of the DVD.

Next, Warner leads the group with stance training.  The group quickly goes through nine stances, performing each several times before going to the next.  At this point, you are almost 21 minutes into the DVD.  Punches come next, and Warner continues to lead the group through a series of five punches from the horse stance.  Five blocks are practiced next in the same manner.  Five basic kicks are practiced next.  The kicks are performed in place from a fighting stance.  These end at the 30-minute mark, and the kids are then led in some relaxation and breathing exercises to cool down.  The training workout ends at the 32-minute mark.

The next part of the DVD focuses on the Kung Fu Code.  Warner explains the 10 word code as the students recite together before each definition.  The code: Humility, Respect, Virtue/Righteousness, Trust, Loyalty, Will, Endurance, Perseverance, Patience, and Courage.  The kids then share one of their favorite things about Kung Fu.  Hopefully, they will put out a second DVD that includes some of the favorite things mentioned, such as kicking combinations and other drills to keep kids active and interested.

The next sections of the DVD focus on illustrating the correct way to perform the stances, punches, blocks, and kicks that were included in the training workout.  Warner has two older students with him and the three of them perform the movements as Warner discusses how to perform them correctly.  After the instruction, Warner has the two students with him kick pads to illustrate how to train with them.  The section ends just after the 65 minute mark.

To conclude the DVD, there is a short explanation of the Sun/Moon Greeting by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, and then Nicholas Yang and Ben Warner share the importance of Kung Fu in their lives and their goals regarding teaching the art and this DVD.  There are also some positive words from a few parents and adults regarding the Yang Martial Art Academy training programs.

Again, I firmly believe in the positive benefits kids can learn from studying martial arts, and I think this DVD, ""Kung Fu For Kids"" is a good program aimed at younger students.  The DVD has a good menu system so you can go to the section of the DVD you want to study, or the workout program to follow along with.  The DVD insert also contains the menu of what is on the DVD.  Obviously, the best thing is to enroll kids in a good program with a live instructor.  However, if you have kids and want to help them with their interest and training, this at home workout may be just the thing to get them moving.

The instructors teach in a fun but serious manner without talking down to anyone, as we adults sometimes do, that's nice.  An added bonus is this is a video for the whole family not just the kids.

One word: YES. Absolutely, yes!

Going through the DVD is like having a full class of instruction - it goes from a warm up to techniques and these are also broken down into segments which include stances, punches and kicking.

The routine, though quite basic, really will give you and your kid quite a workout! (YES, I would recommend this DVD also to adults for themselves). Although it is designed to be used with kids, there is nothing childish about it. It's solid workout. Solid martial arts!

3993861,4,B002UZDI3Y,"9 year old nephew didn't like this.

I bought this for my 9 year old nephew and he didn't care for this very much.
When I viewed the DVD I noticed that the children in the DVD seemed be younger.
Or to me, not very many looked to be in the age of 9 to 12, even though this is rated for 7 to 12.
I think that at this age children are very age conscious and look for activities done by people their age or older.

So there you go, what can I say.  If you are going to rate a childern's DVD for an age group then you should have children of that age or slightly older.  It may be that 7 to 12 is too wide of an age range to cover at that age.

However, all children are different.  And the DVD its self is very well made.  The photography is well lit and focus is great and the people are always centered in the video.  The menus for the DVD are also very nice.  And the instructor was very patient with the childern and was very good at explaining the moves.",1271721600,3,955,3.8316326530612246
3993862,4,B002UZDI3Y,"This is a great introduction to Shaolin Long Fist Kung-Fu for children. I have practiced Taiji for several years and was looking for a way to introduce my daughter (a second grader) to Chinese martial arts. We have been following the entire routine (four days a week) for almost two months.

The practical part of the video begins with the teacher and a group of kids doing a stretching routine. This is followed by a warm-up and then four sections; stances, punches, blocks and kicks. About 40 minutes in all. There is a detail section where the teacher and two more advanced students practice the moves in the first section. At first my daughter and I just watched the detailed sections but now we pick one each day and work on it.

This is just the ticket for us.

Some minor nits: There is a VERY LONG section where random people (probably the parents of the kids in the class) speak about kung-fu. Judging from what I saw it is simply padding to up the minute count. Sometimes the speakers seem to pause (as if to say ""that's all I have to say"") and then appear to be prompted to continue.

There is a section where Dr. Yang speaks about the Sun/Moon greeting. I wish there was actual instruction on how it is performed. The class repeats it several times but only the hand posture is described.

There is a cute section where the kids in the class say what they like about Kung-fu. Several of them mention kicking combinations which are not discussed elsewhere on the video. On the whole the production values are quite good and I hope YMAA comes out with a second beginners Kung-Fu DVD to go with this one.",1271721600,2,1613,4.4727891156462585

3993864,5,B002UZDI3Y,"This lively, fun program is designed to introduce children to the basic exercise and movements that form the foundation of Kung Fu (and martial arts) training. On first viewing I was excited about the prospect of having fun with my nieces and nephews while introducing them to a sound physical regimen based on the ancient principals of Kung Fu. Soon though, I realized that this program was also valuable for adults like me, who'd enjoy ""back to basics"" martial arts foundation training through a traditional kung fu work-out.

The first part of the program is a typical YMAA kid's training work-out conducted by YMAA children's instructor Ben Warner and a charming and energetic group of youngsters. The work-out begins with stretching, warm-up exercises and running and jumping. In the sections that follow, basic kung fu stances, punches, blocks and kicks are introduced and drilled. The training work-out concludes with breathing techniques and sitting meditation designed to calm the body and mind after exercise. A well rounded training, indeed!

The second part of the program places more emphasis on the individual stances, punches, blocks and kicks with detailed demonstrations by Ben Warner and two young and talented YMAA students. By practicing along with these sections, children - and adults - have the opportunity to practice and learn each movement more thoroughly.

The training sections are followed by parent's and YMAA instructor's testimonials as to the benefits of kung fu training for children. The program ends with a ""slide show"" of funny out-takes which highlight the laughter, fun and joy experienced by the children and instructors during production of this DVD. YMAA has done a fine job with ""Kung Fu for Kids"" - a fun, upbeat kung fu training program for kids - and adults - of all ages.",1269388800,7,1818,5.114478114478114
