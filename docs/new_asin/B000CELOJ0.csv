Quentin Tarantino tries to create movies like this and here is one that is true grindhouse. Give it a try. If you like this one, you will really like ""Shallow Ground"". It has about the same budget and the story line in that one is very good as well.",1251504000,2,340,4.08955223880597
8098174,1,B000CELOJ0,"Don't bother with this movie. It's not even worth getting for free. Hand a video camera to some rednecks and tell them to make a horror movie, And this is what you'll get. The effects in the movie were pretty good for it's extremely low budget, but the obsurd acting makes it all unenjoyable. I don't even know what to say, I'm speechless at how bad this movie was. Picture a few guys in there 30's with acting capabilities of high schoolers making a film for class. The cinematogrophy was even terrible.",1240099200,,504,4.489130434782608
