8044906,5,B00076KRZK,These are two beautiful looking films. They are quite exquisite. The photography is brilliant. I especially liked the English subtitles. They were pleasing on the eye and quite easy to read. They made the narrative of these films flow quite smoothly. Vladimir Cosma's score to MY MOTHER'S CASTLE was splendid.,1174867200,,309,5.2
