1901046,3,B0000A0LAK,"Mr Brozman is an exceptional slide guitarist and if you are an intermediate or better this could be a great learning tool.  However, if you're a beginner, I recommend you look elsewhere.  Why?  1) The small booklet that accompanys the DVDs is lacking and it is difficult to correlate what he's playing with what little info is written down. 2) He may be slowing down, but it is still very difficult to follow exactly what he's doing.  I found I would spend a great deal of time watching and rewinding, watching and rewinding, etc and at the end of my practice session not felt like I had progressed...very frustrating. 3) He is starting from the assumption you know something about open tunings, so if you don't this can cause difficulties.

I purchased a Mel Bay slide basics book that goes through open tunings in D, G and a couple of others.  For a beginner or early intermediate, I suggest starting here, then move to BB's DVDs.",1193270400,12,932,4.5843373493975905
1901047,5,B0000A0LAK,"This DVD, along with volumes 2 & 3, are hands down the best available if you want to play authentic pre-war style blues slide guitar.  Bob Brozman is an extraordinary player with an encyclopedic knowledge of the music.  Bob's incredible chops are vividly documented not only on this DVD but in the 26 recordings he has released since his first in 1981.  Beyond the music, Bob is acknowledged as the world's foremost authority on National guitars.  His 1993 book, The History and Artistry of National Resonator Instruments, is the definitive work on the topic.  Bob's passion for pre-war blues and slide guitar comes across clearly throughout this DVD.

If you have never touched a guitar before this DVD may not be the best place to start.  Even though Bob starts from the very beginning and leads the viewer through all aspects of slide playing in detail, the early sections progress quickly and it is helpful to already be comfortable with first position chords and basic finger picking.  If you have been playing for a while but have not learned finger picking you can learn the basics here if you can resist the temptation to skip ahead to the embellishments Bob demonstrates as the lesson progresses.

Tone is what differentiates a rudimentary slide player from an excellent player.  Bob explains, demonstrates, and leads the viewer through progressive exercises that will help you produce the clean and accurate tones that sets one slide player apart from another.  Even if you are already a slide player the DVD is worth the price for Bob's instruction on harmonics.  I can say from experience that adding a few tasteful harmonics into your slide playing now and then will set you apart at a jam!

DVD 1 in this series starts with the basics and rapidly progresses into repertoire tunes such as ""Walking Blues,"" ""I Can't Be Satisfied,"" ""Crossroads Blues,"" and ""Come On In My Kitchen.""  Along the way Bob teaches tricks and embellishments used by players like Robert Johnson, Bukka White, Muddy Waters, and Tampa Red.  Most of the instruction uses the popular Open G (""Spanish"") tuning though there is a section on Open E (""Vastapol"") tuning.  (More in Volumes 2 & 3.)

You simply will not find anyone that knows the history of the music, the instruments, and how to play it and demonstrate basic and advanced playing techniques better than Bob Brozman.  There are other tutorials on blues slide guitar but why not start with the best?  Highly recommended if you are at all serious about slide guitar playing in the Delta Blues style.",1151625600,19,2540,4.851508120649652
1901048,5,B0000A0LAK,"Simply a must for every slide guitar player. Along with vol. 2&3, this DVD really gets you to improve your bottleneck-style ability.",1136073600,2,132,5.045454545454546
7995420,4,B0000A0LAK,"A good beginner video in which he sets out to teach you the alphabet, not song necessarily, of bottle neck guitar playing.  This is a very thorough, detailed explanation of bottleneck technique.  I also noticed a T. Feldmann review which gave me the confidence to buy it as he has his own series of lessons on bottle neck and fingerstyle that are superb.  Just search for his as well, and if that was not a Tom Feldmann review what a coincidence.  Beware it's not as easy as it may seem to just slide up and down the neck and make the guitar sing like Fred Mcdowell.",1452211200,2,566,4.311320754716981
7995421,5,B0000A0LAK,"get the series - Bob is just incredible to learn from, watch, be inspired!",1446854400,,74,4.357142857142857
7995422,5,B0000A0LAK,Well done.  Fun to learn and Brozman does a great job of breaking down the songs and playing them clearly.  The tabs help where something does not seem clear.  Generally when I had to turn to the tabs I would recognize later that it was clear in the demonstration but I had not been patient with the viewing.  In other words it was the fault of the student not the teacher.  Isn't that curious?,1381795200,,394,4.27027027027027
7995423,2,B0000A0LAK,"Unlike some of the other reviews on here, I found the long section on getting proper tone and positioning very useful. I can see how this wouldn't be appropriate for a beginning guitarist, though.

But when Homespun tells you ""includes tab,"" what they really mean is ""here's a tiny booklet with some licks, but none of the four included songs are tabbed.""

When I phoned Homespun to ask where the alleged tab was for the four songs included, a very nice lady was sad to tell me that they don't exist. When asked how a buyer is supposed to know which of their DVDs that say ""include tab"" actually *don't*, she was at a loss.

I really want to support companies like Homespun, I know they struggle against P2P piracy. But they're flat-out lying to customers about what's included when you do the right thing and buy instead of torrent. They certainly won't get any more business from me unless I've checked it out beforehand via alternate methodology.",1303948800,13,949,4.636904761904762
7995424,5,B0000A0LAK,"After performing bottleneck gospel/blues professionaly for the past 12yrs I've noticed a trend amongst my generation (30somethings) of players which concerns me greatly...wild, fast, sloppy playing sounds more authentic. I have had numerous conversations with fellow players attempting to convince them that fast and sloppy playing isn't more authentic, it's just fast and sloppy playing.

Brozman makes it a point to address just that in DVD 1. He states that the originators were trying thier best to play as clean as possible but due to bad strings, bad guitars and pretty lowsy recording equipment it created a challenge to do so, although many did achieve very clean playing (Tampa Red, Blind Willie Johnson, Robert Johnson, etc.,).

DVD 1 is critical in learning the fundamentals of control, both with slide and picking. I highly recommend DVD 1 for any players.

DVD 2 covers classic detla blues material Brozman style. Plenty of ""tricks"" to be learned even if your not looking to sound like a Brozman copy.

DVD 3 expands into more open tunings. Again, plenty of ""tricks"" to be learned.

Whether these are too advanced for the beginner I cannot say because I'm not a beginner. I can say that minutes into DVD 1 I wished I had these DVD's when I was learning because it's taken me 12yrs to acquire the skills I could've learned in months of working with these lessons.

All in all these DVD's will help get the wheels of creativity flowing in your own playing...and playing clean.",1295913600,3,1487,4.904382470119522
7995425,5,B0000A0LAK,"I have alrealdy reviewed DVD 2, My best suggestion for any new player or experience player is to purchase all three. Bob covers all the necessary steps for you to learnto play bottleneck slide.
All you need is the desire to learn and these DVD's cover what you will need.",1284249600,,271,4.44
7995426,5,B0000A0LAK,"This DVD has a lot going for it. Not only does Brozman teach solid technique, but he goes on to reveal the lick in open G tuning that is at the heart of so much Delta Blues Slide Guitar. Then he expands this lick into two choruses of Delta Blues that sound great, are easy to learn and fun to play. Furthermore, the material is conveyed in a relaxed and confident manner.",1282694400,,371,4.166666666666667
7995427,1,B0000A0LAK,"I ordered all 3 DVD's in this series and cut my losses a few days later by unloading them on a good unsuspecting person on Ebay.  Bob Brozman is the J.C. Whitney of slide guitar - (each song includes every unnecessary option and accessory).  In a massive, tedious, overkill, the first DVD is mostly devoted to how to hold and move the slide just like the instructor.  If you really want to play slide guitar just listen to a lot of whoever you like, tune to open, and have at it. At least you can say you did it yourself.",1232236800,3,521,4.19
7995428,2,B0000A0LAK,"an obviously talented musician, I am not sure I can say that he is a talented teacher.  I own all 3 volumes and really struggle with the tempo. As another reviewer said, the tab is not precise, and Bob moves very quickly through the material.  An advanced intermediate guitarist would likely benefit the most.

One thing that did catch me off guard was when he began to sing.  At first, I thought he was just being funny, and imitating an ""old African-American"" sound and style of singing; like a parody.  I was not correct in this; apparently, this was not meant to be humorous.

Most everything from Homespun is gold.  They seem to choose talented artists who are also gifted teachers.  I am not sure that this DVD fits that bill.  Bob is an incredible guitarist, but for an instructional DVD, a talent for communicating that skill, like so many others on Homespun, is essential.",1213747200,9,881,4.632258064516129
7995429,5,B0000A0LAK,"Rather than write a long and involved review (I'd actually rather be playing guitar), I'll ditto everything ""hepcat"" said above.

No, this DVD isn't for music novices, but if you're new to slide guitar, I think it's perfect. After just a couple of evenings I can tell I've made big strides in my playing.

Note that there are no real tunes on this DVD; that's not what Bob wanted to illustrate. He does use parts of several famous tunes to show some very important slide techniques. I would recommend this DVD for learning technique, and Stefan Grossman's DVD to learn a mess of great tunes. Taken together, you'll have a great foundation for enjoying classic blues slide guitar.

I just wish I'd have purchased the complete set  of Brozman's Bottleneck Blues Guitar. (I'll be getting volume II very shortly, which I think says a lot abut how I feel about volume I.)

Okay, time to play guitar.",1203033600,7,894,4.6687898089171975
