5889568,5,B00E44EZUE,I just enjoy the old mysteries. The original Hildegarde is my favorite. We just need more of them. The new mysteries do not measure up!!,1376611200,47,136,4.48
5889569,1,B00E44EZUE,We couldn't watch most of the movies - with very poor quality of both video and audio.  I would have loved to be able to watch these movies with my 89 year/old mom (who loves old movies) but was truly diappointed with the quality.,1376438400,21,230,4.2272727272727275
5889570,5,B00E44EZUE,"Hildegaard Withers character in the three murder mysteries are without a doubt, the most delightful characterization of a school marm mentality of her era. She played it to a Tee. These three are my most favorite murder mysteries ever. Though Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers and Ngaio Marsh as authors soon would come on the scene, and into movies, Gleason and Whithers showed us a long forgotten era of simplicity, kindness and mesmorizing relationships what we would call, silly old fashion emotions that we have long forgotten as a nation. It was the best and the worst of times and it was a time, we had to talk to each other or go find a phone. Wonderful wonderful black and whites.",1376006400,187,687,4.733333333333333
5889591,4,B00E44EZUE,"As noted in the other reviews, the three Edna May Oliver episodes are fun and well written, one Zasu Pitts is pretty good, the other episodes not so much.  James Gleason is best at supporting the lead, weak when featured.",1515628800,,221,4.525
5889592,4,B00E44EZUE,Who done it comedy that is fun to watch.  I enjoyed all six.  The movies were good with any or all of the Hildgardes.,1515542400,,117,3.8333333333333335
5889593,2,B00E44EZUE,This a two DVD set but was only able to watch one DVD the other DVD wouldn't paly get skipping and stopping.  I enjoyed the first goup of movies it's a shame couldn't watch the rest.,1511136000,,182,4.055555555555555
5889594,5,B00E44EZUE,"Never heard of the writer or these movies but took a chance.  LOVE them.  Gleason is fantastic as a NY cop and I liked all 3 of the actresses that played Hildegarde (though liked May the best).  Sort of smart aleck, gentle digs of the type seen in Laurel and Hardy, Francis the talking Mule, Ma and Pa Kettle and the like.  Have since read a few of the books and they did a good job of capturing the characters.",1510876800,,411,4.1
5889595,4,B00E44EZUE,"The Hildegarde Withers movies are fun old fashion mysteries.  The language is mild and the ""violence"" is minimal.  The first three films of the series stars Edna May Oliver as Hildegarde Withers and she is most similar to the character in the books written by Stuart Palmer.  She is the quintessential old maid school teacher, abrupt, bossy and nosey. One eyebrow raised is enough to convey her contempt for the slow police officers she has to contend with.  The fourth film stars Helen Broderick as Hildegarde.  I am a big fan of hers, but, don't care for her in the part.  She plays the Hildegarde  as sophisticated and she is unimaginable as a school teacher.  Zazu Pitts plays the character in the 5th and 6th films and is too ditzy.  Hildegarde is always the smartest one in the room and 3 steps ahead of everyone else and Ms. Pitts does not convey that.  James Gleason is in all 6 films as Inspector Piper, Hildegarde's foil.  He is uniformly good since he has played similar parts in many movies in the 30's and 40's.  He is best playing off of Edna May Oliver.
The quality of the films is fairly good considering their age.
If you are a 30's and 40's film buff and enjoy your murder mysteries with some humor you should enjoy these especially the ones with Edna May.",1505952000,2,1274,4.491304347826087

5889603,5,B00E44EZUE,"Ah, a return to the screen decency and creativity which produced some masterpieces. Edna Mae and James are a director's delight as they effortlessly pursue clues to solve mysterious crimes. And wonder of wonders, here from 80 years ago is a feminine lead running circles around her male counterpart without it being (artificially) politically correct. ..... So, one can overlook the technological short-comings and simply enjoy the movie because ""That's Entertainment.""",1491436800,3,469,5.619718309859155

5889673,4,B00E44EZUE,Hildegarde Withers steals the show in these classic 'whodunit' thrillers. The acting is quite good and the storyline is believable. It will leave you wondering why you waited so long to buy this collection. Entertainment for all ages you can enjoy for years to come. Murder on the Blackboard should be the first one you watch. You'll be hooked. Don't let the black and white fool you. These movies deliver the goods. But don't take my word for it. Check it out for yourself.,1438992000,2,474,4.654761904761905
5889674,3,B00E44EZUE,"My husband and I were very disappointed with ""The Hildegarde Withers Mysteries"" collection.  We like Edna May Oliver and James Gleason, but their characters (and the Hildegarde successors) grew quickly tiresome.  Miss Oliver bounced between scolding school marm and fraidy cat.  Mr. Gleason's character becomes more and more put-upon as the series progresses, until everything anyone says to him irritates him.  The plots are not very clever either, and the pacing is SLOW.  We own many of the 1930s and '40s mysteries collections and this is our least-favorite -- and was, sadly, the most expensive.  Do yourself a favor and save your clams to spend on Boston Blackie, The Lone Wolf, The Falcon, The Saint, Nick Carter, or even ""The Thin Man"" series.  Any one of these is much, much better than Hildegard Withers.",1438992000,,814,5.029850746268656

5889680,5,B00E44EZUE,"What a joy to watch these wonderful movies from the 30s. The movies and sound are great. As for the movies themselves the first 5 are as good as it gets. Good plots, acting, humor. It is all there and you will find yourself watching them more than once. Well worth addling to your collection. The fifth movie is the only one that is less than great, it is only good, but that takes nothing away from this collection. As stated all but the fifth movie is great, but Edna May Oliver and James Gleason are the best of the best. Gleason is in all six movies and always does a very good job. Oliver is in the first three and those along with the next two are full of the best of plots that keep you thinking what next. The action never stops until the bad guys are rounded up. Every now and then you find a real gem and this is one of them.",1434931200,2,835,4.036144578313253

The original 3 movies with Edna May Oliver are the best, but James Gleason is great in all 6 as the put-upon detective of the duo.  Zazu Pits it good, too, but no one could ever replace Edna as the spinster with a spine!  Wonderfully fun films!!",1421280000,,364,4.098591549295775

watch.  One film froze and wouldn't play further; replacement was sent without fuss and played without problems.  Todays
films could not hold a candle to these 'oldies'.  Excellent value; all mystery buffs should add this DVD to their collection.",1421280000,,371,5.456140350877193

5889706,5,B00E44EZUE,"I loved the first three with Edna May Oliver; the fourth with Helen Broderick wasn't bad but the two with ZaSu Pitts, I agree with the Reviewer who said this:

""Even stranger though, is the casting of ZaSu Pitts as the next Hildegarde Withers (in the last two films offered in this collection). ZaSu handily killed the series by making Hildegarde a bumbling idiot who stumbles onto the correct solution more by accident than any brilliance on her part. She reduces Hildegarde to a dizzy distracted ninny""

5889710,5,B00E44EZUE,"These are just plain fun to watch. Note as I did NOT catch this any other time I watched it, but the original first movie has Edna May Oliver and James Gleason running of to get married. Very cute, as the second has them NOT married. Unexplained, but probably necessary to develop the series. The first three are Oliver and the third has the murder when she is on a trip. This brings the thought that she maybe the first ""murder she wrote"" type who has murders fall into her lap. The fourth is good, new Hilde, and the banter is a bit more henpecked. The fifth and sixty is more team like and almost seems like a marriage set up. The movies are good.
Problems: Amazon has them made after you order and my first two movies on the first two discs are almost the worst copies you can have, not drop outs, but Blacked out by the process or processors. Theses movies were NOT shot in dark out scenes in imitation of a monster night brawl. Adjusting the tv for better watching is a bit much! Instead of $40, or $24 discounted, I suggest the pricing value at more like $12. Enjoy them for being an early quickly done series and see Hollywood glitzing even at this early time. Thanks, Harry!",1417046400,4,1183,4.309417040358745
5889711,5,B00E44EZUE,I am a mystery fan collector and would like to make a few comments on this purchase of the Hildegarde Withers collection.  If you have every heard of Edna May Oliver then you are in for a treat with at least three of the six mysteries on a two disc dvd.  She is a school teacher and along with a homicide detective James Gleason solve the mysteries.  There is a wonderful chemistry between them that adds a little rye humor to the films but never the less ends up solving the crimes.  There are two women in the other three mysteries that solve the crimes in their own ways with the assistance of James Gleason.  I would recommend this two disc set to those mystery fans to add to their collection.,1416614400,2,698,4.297709923664122
5889712,5,B00E44EZUE,Love this series. Wish there were more.,1416009600,,39,4.714285714285714
5889713,4,B00E44EZUE,"Overall, it's worth picking up this set, especially for the first three movies with Edna May Oliver as Hidegarde.  The first three truly
are the best.  They are witty and priceless for the classic movie fan. Oliver's Hidegarde and Gleason's Piper have wonderful chemistry and pizazz together. I caught bits of the Oliver-Gleason movies on Turner Classic a few times and really wanted to see the movies in their entirety.  I really didn't like the other three movies nearly as well.  However, in the interest of ""completion"" they are worth having in this set because there may come a time that the movies aren't available.  The audio and video some times leave a bit to be desired, yes, but it wasn't as bad as I might have thought (given the age of the source material).  Pretty happy with the purchase overall, I'll probably re-watch the first three movies again some time.

In a rare instance of needing a replacement as my first shipment had a loose, damaged disc in the case on arrival, Amazon was really expedient in getting the replacement out the door. :)",1414195200,2,1062,4.708108108108108

5889716,5,B00E44EZUE,"I have just finished watching the Withers' movies over the past weeks, and I must disagree with the reviewers that disparaged the Hildegarde actresses who were not Edna Oliver.  Helen Broderick and Zazu Pitts were perfectly fit for the role each played.  Helen Broderick was a more sophisticated and wise cracking Hildegarde.  Zazu Pitts was hilarious, and brought out a side of James Gleason that was really funny.  It seems that the scripts were written with each actress in mind.  I think that each of the Hildegarde actresses added to the value of the collection, rather than detracting from it.  Just my opinion.........",1413331200,4,625,5.019417475728155

Edna May Oliver ""is"" the reason to have these videos. She has such an original concept of behaving in a humorous way, and it is from a knowledge of herself that helps her bring it off. She makes everyday behaviours that your auntie may have funny and endearing.
Her interaction with her policeman friend is fun.
The time period this happens in is shown enough, skyscrapers in New York etc. that you think, ""how'd they do that?"" in what is ancient history to us modern folk.
So yes, buy tis set of videos. I did not like the non-Edna May Oliver stories that much but I hope they grow on me. This is the first time I have even been aware of Edna May, and she has a worthwhile  to see style of comedy which is original and charming and fun.",1410220800,,925,4.138888888888889

Edna May Oliver is excellent as a high strung and hyper Hildegarde in the first 3 of the 6 films. Helen Broderick is more subdued in her interpretation of the character in the 4th film, while ZaSu Pitts is a little, well, ZaSu Pitts in the last two films. There are 2 things I didn't like. First, the last film, ""Forty Naughty Girls,"" involved the leads in a burlesque show which seemed out of character for Hildegarde - but, of course, it was ZaSu. And second, there were racist representations of Jews and African-Americans in the films. With great respect for what the actors who played these roles had to endure to make a living, it is unfortunate that Hollywood in those days resorted to racist characterizations like this for humor.",1403395200,,889,4.6687898089171975

But, they alone are worth the price of the DVD  just to see her as the main character.  James Gleason is in the entire series and does his part very well, even with ZaZu Pitts playing Hildegard as some dimwit who could not find her way into a classroom, much less teach one!  However,  these are so much fun to watch for an old movie buff like myself who will stop whatever I am doing to see what is coming on in ""black and white"".

Edna Mae Oliver was great in three of the films but Helen Broderick and Zasu Pitts also capture the spirit of the sarcastic character of Hildegarde Withers in the other three.

Helen Crawford and Zusa P. were good, but no one is or was as good as Edna May Oliver.  There are eight good movies in the package.  The picture quality is good.

5889780,5,B00E44EZUE,"I've been looking for this particular video for some time and at a price that was reasonable and affordable, too. I found it here at Amazon.com! And I love it! My videos are pristine in picture quality, no dark spots whatsoever, and the sound is excellent, too! I'm sorry that others who have written in, have had problems with theirs, because to see these first 3 mysteries with Edna May Oliver and James Gleason are just too good to miss in all their glorious restoration!
For me, this collection is my GEM above all! I just can't get over the quality! No squiggly lines at the bottom or any kind of distortions whatever.
I don't care for the three other movies with the other actresses...they just don't make the cut, if you know what I mean!
And in those, they seem to make James Gleason out like a bumbling buffoon...and I don't like that. I think he must've cringed at his scripts each time he had to deliver his lines. Nonsense!...as Edna May would've said! Poor James!
No wonder the last three bombed. But I'll tell you...it's worth every cent to have those first three! They're GOLDEN!
I recommend buying these thru Amazon and if you're not satisfied with what you get, I know that the folks at Amazon will make it right! That's just how they are. At least, that always been my experience! I have full confidence in them!
I so enjoy Hildegarde's and Oscar banter and that ""hint"" of their quiet, yet budding romance that neither will admit to!... Well, at least in the first one they...aw...I best not spoil it by telling about it! Just watch and enjoy their union...real or not!
Good mystery hunting with the ""real"" Miss Withers and her (secret crush!) Oscar Piper! I know I am, as I watch them over and over to my heart's content!",1389916800,3,1740,4.526984126984127

Luckily for the set the amazing James Gleason is in all of the movies as Inspector Piper.

As for picture quality, I have no complaints. The picture is clear, sound is great, just like watching it on TCM..!!!

Edna Mae ceased the role because she moved over to MGM, but Gleason continued as the cantankerous police inspector.  The other three in the set are enjoyable, especially the last one in the series starring Zazu Pitts; she starred in the Hildegarde role in the previous movie but now presents a wonderful interpretation of the old girl sleuth.

These are good little mysteries, and although ""The Penguin Pool Murder"" transfer to DVD is a little rougher than the others, it is still more than watchable and a great start to this particular series.

5889799,5,B00E44EZUE,The quality of the films is excellent. As a lover of 1930's mystery books and detective stories I highly recommend these films. Stuart Palmer wrote the Hildegarde Withers mysteries with  the actress Edna May Oliver in mind. She was a great comedic actress and most of these films star her. Some were made with other actresses  as good at comedy as Miss Oliver.  These are very well done true to Mr palmers written word and well preserved. I recommend them to every one. Bet you get hooked on early mysteries and seek out other Edna May Oliver films.,1380931200,5,549,4.581632653061225

Reloading the disc did nothing to clear the situation.  Never did get to watch the end on Murder on the Blackboard.  Very disappointed and worried about purchasing other digitized old movies because of quality of reproductions or rather lack thereof.",1380844800,17,419,4.791666666666667
5889801,5,B00E44EZUE,"First, I did not detect any sound issues with my DVD-R set of the Hildegarde Withers mysteries.  But yes, at times, the picture quality does tend to be a bit scratchy in appearance.  This is not constant.  Otherwise, this is a pretty good transfer for movies this old.

The first three movies are the best because they star Edna May Oliver.  Her performance of Miss Hildegarde Martha Withers is peerless.  The mysteries are fun; the first involves a class outing that soon turns into murder, with Hildegarde as one of the unlikely suspects.  She's determined to find the killer because she has no confidence that the police ever will.  Enter James Gleason as the harried Inspector on the case.  He's the perfect foil for Hildegarde; their verbal exchanges are hilarious.  It's a pity they weren't paired for the full six films.  Unfortunately two other actresses took over the lead role alongside James Gleason who deservedly got star billing against them.  The first was the mother of actor Broderick Crawford, Helen Broderick.  Although best known as a wisecracking character actress, Broderick stumbles with her interpretation of Hildegarde, turning her into an aloof sidekick given to the occasional acerbic wit.  She is stiff and formal and presides over every scene with a smirk, there's nothing remotely lovable about her.  Even stranger though, is the casting of ZaSu Pitts as the next Hildegarde Withers (in the last two films offered in this collection).  ZaSu handily killed the series by making Hildegarde a bumbling idiot who stumbles onto the correct solution more by accident than any brilliance on her part.  She reduces Hildegarde to a dizzy distracted ninny, ""Oh dear, oh my............""
Oh well, three out of the six films are great, the others are just okay.  (But I did miss Edna May by the end of them.)

Favorite verbal exchange:  ""Could it be suicide?""  ""Not unless he was a contortionist!""",1379808000,134,1914,4.974763406940063

5889803,5,B00E44EZUE,Love the old detective movies especially Hildegarde Withers.  She is always outsmarting the detective.  They are just nice stories with a bit of mystery and takes you back to a better time.,1379462400,2,189,4.875
5889804,5,B00E44EZUE,"This set is a recent discovery for me and a pure delight. I love all three Hildegardes - Edna Mae Oliver is my favorite; Helen Broderick nails the tone of the put-downs (as she does in Top Hat for which she is better known); Zasu Pitts is an acquired taste but comes across as very observant and intelligent in her two outings. My favorites as to mysteries are Honeymoon - the scenes of Catalina are priceless and the mystery is good; and the atrociously titled 40 naughty girls - another great mystery. But all of them are good. Another actor to be praised is James Gleason as the Inspector who makes each of the Hildegardes believable. He treats each of them with the same grudging respect and affection and he carries the entire series. Without him I don't think the whole series would feel as smoothly woven and I can't wait for him to be on the screen. As far as quality, I watch all these old movies on a 9 inch blu ray player/monitor with an ear bud and have not had the problems with sound and video that other reviewers have noted. Penguin Pool is the poorest quality but it is 81 years old and we're lucky to have it at all.

5889805,1,B00E44EZUE,"I love the old movies---watched the first one in this collection and was somewhat disappointed by the poor sound quality---well, old movies do have some issues.

Seeing the 1930's clothes, cars, settings, etc. is always fun for me, but the movie was such a  D R A G.
Slow, predictable (does the butler always do it??).  Not much to hold my attention in the story line.  And nothing in this first movie to entice me to watch the remainder of the titles in this collection.

All and all, for me, the major impact of this move was being so astounded by the lady detective immediately jumping into her role of smarmy,  pseudo-genius,  know-it-all,  while happily making snide put-down remarks about her counterpoint sleuth:  the MORON male police detective.  W0W such modern-day thinking 80 years ago!!!

The movie I watched lost its appeal with the never-ending:  women are SO superior to those pitiful ignoramus men running around bothering everyone.  Male-bashing in the 1930's quite a study in how far we've come!!",1378684800,5,1014,4.894117647058824

I must admit I am disappointed in the audio of the first in the series.  Then again I find a good many of the films from the early thirties seem to have deficiencies in that area.  My preference in the series, of course, is the pairing of Edna May Oliver and James Gleason-what a lark they must have had making these films.",1377648000,51,439,4.129411764705883
5889810,5,B00E44EZUE,"Only the first three movies in the collection feature Edna May Oliver in all her awesome glory. Edna May Oliver IS the one and only Hildegarde Withers.  Edna May Oliver rocks in the role of Hildegarde Withers her almost gaunt drawn prudish face is almost the spitting image of an old maid.  Edna May Oliver's vocal intonation, prim proper speech and how she carries herself as a matronly old spinster school teacher of both quality and breeding is played to absolute perfection.  When she is paired with the dour but manly Inspector  from the New York City Police Department she really shines.  The police inspectors blue collar, street wise roots contrast nicely against Hildegarde Withers Mysteries upper-crust natures and sensibilities.  There is enough comedy in these mystery movies to keep one entertained but the comedy never gets in the way of the who-done-it.  The Mysteries stand on their own in quality as they are not watered down to make room for the comedy.  The comedy comes natural as the banter between Hildegarde Withers and the police detective center on class differences, the inspectors limited schooling \ logic and the detectives rather pugnacious bulldog like tendency to chase all suspects with equal vigor.  Hildegarde Withers constantly reins in the good police inspector as she slowly methodically over time ferrets out the wrong-doer. These movies are great despite these being among the worse prints of the Penguin Pool Murders I have seen.

I purchased a rare DVD print of the Penguin Pool Murders that had Chinese writing as part of the introduction but; BOTH the sound and picture quality was the best I have ever seen anywhere!  The Penguin Pool Murders copy on this DVD is in video at best only poor to fair at 6 out of possible 10 in quality. The video is very dim at times making it difficult to see what is going on.  The video at times us to bright so details are washed out in a sea of intense brightness.  The video is watchable for a person with reasonably good eyes but only just.  People with poor eyesight will get nothing but a killer headache from watching this low quality video transfer.

The sound quality of the Penguin Pool Murders is barely a 5 out of a possible 10.  The sound fades in and out.  Generally the sound is so low you must turn your sound to max volume just to hear what is being said.  At such high volume there is the annoying hum of equipment of some sort throughout the movie.  The audio is hard to hear in some areas degrading to impossible to hear in other areas. The quality of the sound is just bad enough to make you struggle to understand what is being said which prevents one from becoming fully immersed \ involved in the fine acting and strong plot.

The sound and video image in the Murder on the Blackboard is only just slightly better than the first offering at 6 out of 10 and barely that.  Murder on the Blackboard had essentially the same flaws as I reported in the Penguin Pool Murders consisting mostly of equipment noise and bad image quality.

The Murder on a Honeymoon the final DVD movie to feature Edna May Oliver as Hildegarde Withers is by far the best in the bunch regards sound quality.  The sound is loud and relatively clear given the poor sound of the earlier movies in this collection.  Sound in Murder on a Honeymoon is 7.5 out of 10 but video is still only fair to poor in most places.

You might ask if the video and sound are so bad why did I give this The Hildegarde Withers Mysteries Movies Collection my highest 5 star rating, those who read my reviews know I tend to be hard on everything. I demand quality always.  Those who know my reviews might wrongly think I am going soft. NOPE I'm just as hard core as ever!  The Hildegarde Withers Mysteries Movies Collection is just such a rare collection of the finest work that I can't let technical imperfections deprive potential buyers of these gems.  Edna May Oliver is just so completely priceless as Hildegarde Withers that even if I factor every horrible aspect of the digital copy into my equation I still get FIVE STARS.  I am soooo happy The Hildegarde Withers Mysteries Movies Collection is part of my DVD library I don't care about the lapse in quality.  Before The Hildegarde Withers Mysteries Movies Collection there were NO legal copies of Murder on the Blackboard and Murder on a Honeymoon to be had anywhere. The now out of print Penguin Pool Murders DVD sells for ridiculous prices. If you were lucky you might make a copy of a Hildegarde Withers Mystery movie from a showing on cable but that your best hope till now.  The Hildegarde Withers Mysteries Movies Collection shows us the power of a strong woman in a man's world long before the 1960's.  Of course The Hildegarde Withers had to faint at the sight of dead bodies and cling to a strong man when things got rough due to the conventions of the day.  Yet Hildegarde Withers even diluted was still a stong woman in a world where good proper ladies were seldom portrayed as so powerful, strong willed and capable!
