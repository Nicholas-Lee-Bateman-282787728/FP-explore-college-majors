1973358,5,B00015YVR2,"This is a must-see for anyone who's loved this play for years and anyone who is just looking for a wonderful movie to curl up on the couch with.  It's a powerful movie that will certainly touch you.  Once you watch it, it will remain one of your favorites and will be taken out again and again over the years.

I think it's rare to find a play that translates well onto the screen.  All of the details that make a play incredible can look ridiculous in a movie.  But for some reason, PBS got it right.  You feel like you ARE watching a play when you watch this movie.  Their movements are exaggerated enough that you can picture yourself sitting in the audience - and at the same time, their facial expressions are so minute that you could not fully appreciate them if they were on the stage.  It's truly incredible.

The casting is just flawless.  The big names deliver perfect character interpretations, as one would expect from actors such as Paul Newman.  The lesser known names, however, are just as immaculate.  The entire movie is visual perfection from beginning to end.",1236988800,4,1078,4.528497409326425
1973359,5,B00015YVR2,"""Choose an unimportant day"" is the advice her mother-in-law gives Emily, newly arrived at the land of the dead, when she decides to return to the world briefly in Thornton Wilder's incomparable classic. Emily chooses her 12th birthday to return to earth and finds even that day all too painful and quickly leaves Grover Corners to be with the dead. This heartbreaking scene still makes my eyes burn as the play remains powerful, having survived countless high school productions. Paul Newman as the stage manager gives a brilliant performance. Some of his lines must have been poignant for him: ""You wake up one day and you are 70.""  He is now old, over 80-- but he has aged well-- and venerable but still a fine actor and a perfect choice to head this production, originally produced at the Westport Country Playhouse and later moved to Broadway. In commentary that accompanies the play Joanne Woodward, one of the producers, said that she wanted to mount this prouction after the awful events of 9/11.

Almost anything you can say about ""Our Town"" will sound trite, but it is universal, timeless and about all the things that matter-- young love, marriage, old age, death, the daily routines of putting a meal on the table, the beauty of living day to day although we the living sometimes run roughshod over others with our own self-centeredness and do not look at the stars enough.

Watching this production for the second time, I was struck at how poetic Wilder's language is and how beautifully Mr. Newman delivers his lines, along with the other supporting characters as well. This production is a perfect example that less is more. There are few props and often simple piano music; but you will be convinced, for instance, that Newman is preparing ice cream sodas for Emily and George as he only goes through the motions.

If there is any theatre lover who hasn't seen ""Our Town"" this production would be a good way to spend a worthwhile two hours of an evening. Those who love this play, and we are many, will of course want to see it too.",1216684800,15,2047,4.693593314763231
1973360,4,B00015YVR2,"... see it here.  Newman as the Stage Manager is completely in charge, and does not succomb to sentiment. A reader, or viewer, who thinks this play is sentimental, may stand corrected, especially when dismissed by Newman at the end of the production.  The staging is minimalist, as originally intended; this is about masterful actors and dialogue, and stagecraft that evokes and insinuates.  Well done!",1203292800,8,402,5.153846153846154
1973361,5,B00015YVR2,If you can't see the real thing this production is the next best thing. Wonderful staging and acting from all the cast.. Paul Newman's performance is worth the price of the DVD on it's own.,1187740800,7,189,4.428571428571429
1973362,5,B00015YVR2,"We bought this DVD because our daughter got the lead (Emily) in her college's presentation of it and we wanted to get an introduction to the play before we went to see it live.  When we watched the movie, we were thoroughly impressed with the acting of the entire ensemble and with the quality of the production.",1163030400,14,312,4.473684210526316
1973363,5,B00015YVR2,"Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winning 1938 play is one of my favorites, and this in an exquisite production of it. Paul Newman as the Stage Manager, in one of his most memorable performances, leads a superb ensemble cast. So much of this play is mime...cooking on the invisible stove, eating the imaginary breakfast...and the actors flow through the movements so easily, one almost sees the missing objects.
Wilder's play, which was inspired by Gertrude Stein's 1925 ""The Making of Americans"", draws one into it, with the actors sometimes talking directly to the viewer; it has a simplicity and charm that make it stay fresh even when one knows the words by heart.
The time is the early 20th century, in Grovers Corners, New Hampshire, and centers on the Webb and Gibbs families, who live next door to each other, and especially Emily Webb (Maggie Lacey) and George Gibbs (Ben Fox), who fall in love with gentle glances and sweet words. Lacey and Fox are luminous, and capture the heart of this lovely play.
As their parents, Jayne Atkinson and Frank Connors are marvelous as Dr. and Mrs. Gibbs, as are Jane Curtin and Jeffrey DeMunn as Charles and Myrtle Webb.
Originally produced for Connecticut's Westport County Playhouse, the show later moved to Broadway, where it garnered Paul Newman, 78 at the time, a Tony nomination.
Directed by James Naughton, this is a splendid performance of a perfect, and quite profound play; it is a keeper, and one that will make you smile, and sometimes weep, over and over again. Total running time is 120 minutes.",1090022400,68,1553,4.8641509433962264
1973364,5,B00015YVR2,"I was first familiarized with ""Our Town"" when I was a child and it has made a lasting impression on me through the years. I love the town of Grovers Corners,getting to know the People and the Town is a truly magical experience. One of my favorite storys of all time. Thornton Wilder transports the viewer into another time and place in such an uplifting,wholesome and haunting way that leaves one in awe. I beleive this version is truly a credit to Mr Wilder's greatest work ""Our Town""!",1079568000,13,486,4.534090909090909
1973365,5,B00015YVR2,"This PBS production of ""Our Town"" catches much of the flavor of the play as Thornton Wilder intended it to be staged.  Paul Newman is fine as the Stage Manager, bringing his long lifetime of experience to a subtle interpretation of the role.  The rest of the cast bring the town of Grovers Corners to life.  Fans of the original ""Saturday Night Live"" may be surprised to see Jane Curtin as Mrs. Webb; although I would have advised her to lose the weird accent she uses, her performance is realistic and adds to the play.
For those who don't know the play, it shows life in a small town in New Hampshire circa 1901 - 1913.  The main characters are two young people who grow up, fall in love, get married, and are separated by death.  On the surface, it's just another piece of nostalgia, but there are dark currents in Grovers Corners, little ironies and inconsistencies that are often commented on by the Stage Manager, and are embodied in the town drunk Simon Stimson.
Be advised if you don't like sentiment: you'll have a lump in throat throughout the entire third act as the play explores the beauty of everyday life.  And afterward, you'll look at your family and friends in a different way.
Bravo to PBS for having the vision to bring this classic to a new audience, staged in the bare-bones way of the original play.  Buy this DVD - you'll watch it over and over and force it on your friends.",1079222400,41,1398,4.458823529411765
1973366,5,B00015YVR2,This version of Our Town is WONDERFUL! I received a copy a few weeks ago after ordering it from PBS. Wonderfully casted and acted. ALL HAIL SIMON STIMSON!!!!,1073174400,14,157,4.642857142857143
1973377,4,B00015YVR2,"The original 1940 movie was grand for its time, but tacked on a ""happy"" ending Hollywood style.  Without tech reconstruction, it is by today's standards quite inadequate - neither sharp nor clear.  This widescreen version made of the stage play starting Paul Newman in the lead role is a true professional production in every way.  It takes a few minutes to get used to the idea that it's a filmed stage play, onstage, with everything but audience reaction, but once you've overcome that effect and began to appreciate the clever cinematic use of multiple cameras, close-ups, etc., it settles you in to appreciate Thornton Wilder's brilliantly conceived tale about life back in the early 1900s.  Though it can be appreciated on the simplest terms of life in Grovers Corners, New Hampshire at that time, going from a day in the lives of two neighboring families, then to love & marriage between a boy & girl from those families, to death and a deeply philosophical/religious level that closes the story, leaving the audience in tears - the kind that Greeks felt at the close of their tragedy plays with their purgative beauty.  Wilder has created the perfect theatrical production, so beautifully written and constructed that it has become produced by everyone from high schools to summer stocks to professinal theatre with remarkable success.  It simply can't fail.  This version, made not too long before both Newman and his wife, who had a strong hand in the production, died.  It has become their legacy.",1478995200,3,1507,4.9523809523809526

1973380,4,B00015YVR2,"Much as I like Paul Newman, I think Spaulding Gray makes a better Stage manager, and Penelope Ann Miller a better Emily. The Thornton Wilder Society says the Version with Grey/Miller is the best of the bunch (Holbrook/ Newman/ Gray). See what you think. My library has the Holbrook/Gray versions on DVD. Maybe yours does too, or can get it for you.",1468022400,,348,4.629032258064516
1973381,5,B00015YVR2,Great for my middle school English class. It keeps to the original stage directions and minimal use of sets.,1466208000,,108,4.7368421052631575
1973382,5,B00015YVR2,"This is a superb production with Paul Newman as the Narrator. His performance is understated yet potent and he holds the complexity of the plot and the characters together in a seemingly effortless way. The other members of the cast are equally gifted and create a mosaic of perspectives that lift the seemingly ordinary lives of people in Anytown, USA into extraordinary realm that brings the message of the appreciating gifts of life into lucid relief. Of not allowing oneself to become blase or embittered. Using pantomime creates a universality of action, allows the audience to imagine the actions of the characters from their own life experience. Likewise, the minimalist set gives the audience the opportunity to superimpose their own sense of the set and scenery.  As I watched this production, I was led to realize how important it is for each audience member to make the experience of the play their own in order to experience the message of the play in the most visceral way. The timelessness and universality of the message of the play is well served with this production.",1465776000,2,1084,4.923497267759563
1973383,5,B00015YVR2,This is my absolute favorite play and those who have seen it/read it understand. Paul Newman steals the show in this and leaves me in awe every time I watch it.,1462492800,,160,4.193548387096774

1973397,5,B00015YVR2,"This version of one of my favorite plays was out of this world.  The story of Grover's Corner New Hampshire directed and acted in by Paul Newman, was in a word perfect.  I especially loved the two young actors who played Emily and George.  The sincerity and innocence of their love story is almost heartbreaking.  The entire cast was superb, but I especially liked how the town drunk, Simon Stimson was done.  He had more dimensions to his personality and the actor showed him as the unhappy, tortured soul he really was.  George's heartbreak at the death of Emily is palpable, he is so lost and so sad.  This is truly an excellent version of the play.  Don't miss it.",1453161600,,668,4.508333333333334
1973398,5,B00015YVR2,Excellent adaptation made all the more poignant by the stand out performance of the late Paul Newman.  Mr.  Newman brings more passion and conviction to the role of the Stage Manager than any actor I've seen.  Simply inspired.,1448236800,,226,4.894736842105263

1973441,5,B00015YVR2,"My son had to do a play review.  He read the book but I also had him watch this to see the staging.  It is an actual video of the play.  Don't get this expecting a movie.  It is the play filmed.  Ladders are used for the high windows in the house, etc.  I wasn't sure my other family members would want to watch it but got it because my son needed to understand the blocking elements for his theater class.  Instead, my other kids came in and really enjoyed it.  The play has some really good messages  Watching it again reminded me of the first time I read the play. It is a good reminder to care for one another and take advantage of the minutes you have with them because you don't get that time back.  I think everyone should watch or read ""Our Town"" at least once.  No matter what you believe, it is a good reminder to LIVE life.",1387324800,2,834,4.0552147239263805

I showed this play to my students to see what interest they would have in a movie with no props or special effects. As the movie progressed, one could tell that each student was sucked into the storyline. To have students actually fill in the blanks themselves proved to be immensely powerful when it came to Act III.

I highly recommend the book, and especially this version of the play to students in ninth grade or higher (although I think the older the students are, the more they will be moved by the final act).
