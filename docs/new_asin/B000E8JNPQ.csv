2509375,5,B000E8JNPQ,"We have ordered various parts of the Monarch of the Glen series over the past few years. What we've learned is not to buy the cheapest. This is because the discs may be of poor quality. We experienced damaged sectors on series 4 when we ordered online from an individual. So this time we ordered from Amazon.com and had excellent results. The moral of the story: ""Pay a little more from an established company like Amazon.com, and get more in return.""

Regarding the content of the series. We are of Scottish heritage which means we have a personal interest. But the episodes are outstanding for anyone to view for the following reasons: Great acting, fascinating screenwriting, beautiful scenery of northern Scotland; lots of suspense, humor, romance. It's got it all. Once you get into the story you won't be able to stop and will want to buy the entire series.",1232668800,,863,4.753333333333333
2509376,5,B000E8JNPQ,"This is a delightful series chronicalling the lives and loves of the residents of Glenbogle estate in Scotland and the efforts of it's heir, Archie, to keep the old castle financially afloat in a modern world. Start with Series One.  You'll enjoy watching their lives unfold.",1229817600,,275,4.978260869565218
2509377,5,B000E8JNPQ,"I really enjoy this dvd.  I have series 1,2,3,and now 4.  I won't rest until collect all 7.  The characters are so real and the scenery is breathtaking.  I shared the dvd with 2 work friends and we all want to live in Glenbogal.
The second disc had some problems but customer service is taking care of the problem in a very courteous manor.
Thanks",1225324800,,347,4.292307692307692
2509378,5,B000E8JNPQ,"I own the entire Monarch of the Glen series. It is intellectual in that it hits all of Scotland's current issues, but also tremendous fun, with beautiful real scenery, great actors, good stories, no nudity and no gore.",1221436800,4,218,4.7631578947368425
2509379,3,B000E8JNPQ,"The passing of Hector at the end of Season 3 was also the death of this delightful and endearing series.  The writing and direction in Season 4 is unpredictable and the characters lose their quirky, lovable shine as they constantly act in ways that are contrary to the characters we grew to know in Seasons 1-3, often with little rhyme or reason.  It begins to feel as if the writers and director had not actually watched the first 3 seasons.

From Season 4 onward, there are several new characters and story arcs and the series becomes a completely different show.  Season 4 is the transition to the ""new"" Monarch of the Glen that is seasons 5-7 and a rocky, troubled transition it is.",1177977600,19,686,4.5528455284552845
2509380,4,B000E8JNPQ,I watched this on TV in the UK and the series is not actually completed on the DVD series.  Most unfortunate.  We are left high and dry because of the lack of the last (possibly) two or three episodes.  Such a shame for a great and repeatable series.,1169251200,8,250,4.166666666666667
2509381,3,B000E8JNPQ,"loved first 3 series, this one losing its edge, goofy, simple plot lines, disappointing, picked up a little by end of series",1155168000,6,124,4.681818181818182
2509382,4,B000E8JNPQ,"For those who have fallen in love with the BBC series Monarch of the Glen, follow the ups and downs, squabbles and antics, and miscommunication of this family.  Season 4 continues the saga of Archie McDonald trying to save the family estate while trying to also make everyone happy and save his sanity.  Like seasons 1-3, season 4 has you sitting there laughing and also appreciating your own family.",1153353600,5,400,4.782608695652174
2509383,5,B000E8JNPQ,"Monarch of the Glen, having finished as a series in Great Britian, is trickling out slowly on DVD to the States. I have seen the fourth series thanks to our Canadian cousins, and can assure viewers the series continues to feature clever thematic writing to go along with the outstanding cast and unsurpassed scenery. The almost effortless merging of several plot lines continues to move each Episode along. The show's writers have  shown a willingness to move the story in different directions, while most of the fine cast of regulars are starting to open out their roles. Particularily impressive has been the symbolic expansion through the wolves project - one does not expect this degree of art from a television series.

  Frankly one has to go back to the days of Brideshead Revisited for a television show of such richness.",1147305600,28,829,4.9
2509384,5,B000E8JNPQ,"I have watched the first two or three 'series' to date, and this show is absolutely spectacular.  The cast of Monarch is superb!  The plots are fun and easy on the mind.  Probably the best part of the show is the location itself.

The shows stars Alastair Mackenzie as Archibald 'Archie' Horatio Hector MacDonald, also starring, from ""The Good Life or Good Neighbors (depending)"" is Richard Briers as Archie's dad (series 1-3), other cast regulars include Alexander Morton, Julian Fellowes, Dawn Steele, Susan Hampshire, and the hilarious Hamish Clark as Duncan!

If anything will make you want to visit Scotland, it's this show!

What I love best about this series and ones from England are that the 'seasons' are so short.  Some shows are 6 episodes total and some are maybe 10 epsiodes, for the entire 'season'.

It sure beats sitting through 20-24 episodes of American television shows, which tend to drag on and on just to get to the season end.

Please check out this fun little show and I think you'll be very surprised at how brilliant it is!",1146700800,20,1050,4.7569060773480665
2509385,5,B000E8JNPQ,This is a really fun series.,1414713600,,28,3.8333333333333335
2509386,5,B000E8JNPQ,"This is a fun quirky series, awesome location with gorgeous scenery.  The characters are great and you never know what will come up next.  Very entertaining and good clean fun.",1411776000,,176,4.833333333333333
2509387,5,B000E8JNPQ,"This was a great series!  I was disappointed when characters
 were omitted from the series tho - once you were
used to them playing their parts, its hard to see them leave, but, other
than that I couldn't wait to get my hands on season 5, 6, &7!",1400112000,,245,4.083333333333333
2509388,4,B000E8JNPQ,Loved this series when on PBS... and love watching on my own time.  Simple case keeps all the discs organized and protected.,1394496000,,124,4.636363636363637
2509389,5,B000E8JNPQ,A mite slow in the beginning but probably necessary for character development with the storyline somewhat repetive  but the highland scenery is awe inspiring.  Glenbogle is well worth a visit.,1392681600,,192,5.366666666666666
2509390,5,B000E8JNPQ,"Great, great , great, super enjoyable, I love the box set - it is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon (and evening) , the scenery, the characters and the story are each wonderful",1388016000,,182,4.228571428571429
2509391,2,B000E8JNPQ,"The first 3 seasons were quirky and delightful... did anyone notice that in Season 4 Lexie became truly intolerable with her attitude of always having to be right; Archie continually apologized to everyone; Duncan was truly made the fool with that crazy girlfriend; and Paul appeared to be angry all the time.  Molly is still charming and Golly, thank goodness, continues to maintain an equilibrium that others could take note of and emulate...",1373932800,,444,5.082191780821918
2509392,2,B000E8JNPQ,"I fell in love with this series and watched the first three seasons with great interest and enjoyment.  It's to the credit of the creators that I became so personally invested in those dear folks!  So much so, that at the end of season three, I was really distressed at the demise of wonderful Hector and the sudden decision of Archie to marry the kitchen maid.  I don't know which was more upsetting to me!  However I liked the other characters so much...and the pipes and kilts...that I tried season 4 and sincerely tried to like Lexie...but ultimately even the eternally delightful Mollie and the jovial Kilwilly and the possibility of a love interest for old Gollie, weren't enough.  I'll never know if Archie managed to make Glenbogle a financial success or not....too bad.",1365033600,,778,4.776119402985074
2509393,4,B000E8JNPQ,"Not up to the first three seasons, we got used to the earlier characters, but to bad they had to knock off Hector and get rid to many others",1356048000,,140,3.8620689655172415
2509394,5,B000E8JNPQ,"the very best of BBC TV and an amazing story in a night-time soap format.  Well developed characters, and not all goofy prat falls like most British TV.",1295568000,,152,4.428571428571429
8107068,5,B000E8JNPQ,I love all the characters.  Well worth watching time and time again.,1508198400,,68,4.666666666666667
8107069,5,B000E8JNPQ,Every time I watch an episode I feel like I am at my new home in Scotland for the next hour and several minutes. I am totally transported to a different reality.,1498521600,,161,4.0625
8107070,3,B000E8JNPQ,"Season 4 continues to be interesting, but some of the spark is gone with Hector now gone and Lexie's role changing from carefree cook to serious laird's wife. There are still funny moments and different things going on with the estate. It is still a fun show to be watching!",1473465600,,274,4.5
8107071,5,B000E8JNPQ,Wonderful series..love the characters...who wind their way into your heart...beautiful music and scenery...,1444262400,,107,7.3076923076923075
8107072,5,B000E8JNPQ,Series 4 was not one of the greatest seasons but still deserves 5 stars. it reminds where my family was from and humor is delightful. the rest series is good but archie makes the entire series.,1441497600,,193,4.388888888888889
8107073,5,B000E8JNPQ,We love the new characters but miss the old ones. Have loved all of them!,1435536000,,73,3.933333333333333
8107074,5,B000E8JNPQ,"Just so enthralling and a huge joy to watch.  Easy to get caught up in the lives of these characters.  Watching it a second time brought more joy and one saw more of the drama missed the first time we viewed it.  Also realistic as a titled being, and living in an incredibly, beautiful large home, is realistically depicted as necessitating execution of all the hard involved .  Loved it, but felt no envy to exchange places with the characters.  All characters were believable and very well cast.",1432339200,,497,4.6022727272727275
8107075,3,B000E8JNPQ,Not any good since the main character is gone.,1431388800,,46,4.222222222222222
8107076,3,B000E8JNPQ,"This isn't the full version, as released by the BBC. This is the edited version, sent over to America. There are missing scenes. I would think for the DVD version they could have released the full version even if they didn't want to give it to us for PBS or BBC America.",1424044800,,270,4.211538461538462
8107077,5,B000E8JNPQ,"I love the series overall, although I must admit the departure of a few key characters changed the tone in many ways. I just purchased a new copy of Series 4, having watched borrowed copies and owned what I believe is a pirated copy of Series 4, and it seems to me that the episodes on the new DVDs are shorter ; scenes I remember from previous viewings of different DVDs are missing.",1421452800,,384,4.273972602739726
