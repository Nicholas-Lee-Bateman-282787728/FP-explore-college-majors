2518580,5,B000EGI2IC,"After all those children and grandchildren, Now, they tell me!

Dr. Denmark's explanations of both what to do after the baby comes, and why, make so much sense.  It would have saved us a lot of sleep.  I got so excited, after watching this DVD that I immediately ordered two more to be sent for my newborn grandson and for a friend's newborn grandson.

The explanations of why feeding on a schedule works best, how to get the baby to sleep through the night - in just three days - and why crying is good for the baby, especially preemies, how to detect food allergies quickly, how to know precisely to the day when baby is ready to begin solid food; amazing. It's all in there.

And how gentle discipline begins at the beginning - and eliminates the need for harsh discipline later- wow! I wish every family could start with Dr. Denmark's plan.

Oh, did I mention that I highly recommend this DVD? Yes, I recommend 'The well Fed, Well Rested Baby' DVD for both new parents, and for old parents who have been there and who are still scratching their heads.",1141776000,4,1055,4.4404145077720205
2518581,5,B000EGI2IC,"Dr. Denmark was my pediatrician.  I am 51 now.  She was also the pediatrician to my children, and 2 of my grandchildren.  She is an amazing woman.  At the age of 108 she is healthier than I am and her advice on raising a child is priceless.  I can't even put into words how much we love her and rely on her book ""Every Child Should Have a Chance"".  If you can get your hands on that book and you are expecting or have children at all, then BUY THE BOOK also!  You will never regret it.  I'd also like to express my utmost thanks to the amazing mothers who put this DVD together.",1139788800,5,578,4.008771929824562
8109551,5,B000EGI2IC,"Soooo thankful for this DVD. I watched it & started the Denmark Method two days later. My baby girl sleep through the night & is such a happy healthy baby! My life was revolutionized! I highly recommend Dr. Denmark books too! The ladies in this video are very sweet & obviously appreciate what Dr. Denmark did for them & their families. The DVD is dated, but I completely enjoyed it & have learned so much, watching it several times!",1480550400,,433,4.493670886075949

8109554,5,B000EGI2IC,"This was just what my daughter needed to get her baby in the proper state of being nourished. Instead of demand feeding at all hours of the day and him still crying constantly instead of being fed the way the hospital and health dept. recommended, he is now on a schedule and eats the same time of day every day, as well as sleeps through the night with the advice given in this wonderful DVD. I had the privilege of taking my two oldest children to Dr. Denmark and she was different than any other pediatrician I had ever met. Instead of abiding by somebody's rules, she stayed true to what she knew worked, even when others were saying it was wrong. For instance, mothers are being told to place the baby on it's back to sleep. Not only did my daughter's baby refuse to sleep this way, there is a danger in choking on any milk or saliva left in the mouth after feeding or if the baby spits up. Their reasoning was that sleeping on the stomach caused babies to die from SIDS, which is simply not the case. There is so much wonderful information to help new, learning mothers in this DVD. If mothers would just listen to what their instincts tell them, they would realize that living a life without sleep and putting their baby at risk is just wrong. I highly recommend this DVD if you want a peaceful home life with your baby.",1431993600,,1327,4.333333333333333
8109555,4,B000EGI2IC,"We used many of Dr. Denmark's suggestions for our first baby and plan on doing the same with #2 (due in a few weeks).  We are huge supporters of Dr. Denmark and attribute her schedule to helping us survive the first two years with our daughter!  She is an excellent sleeper and eater and has been since the beginning!  This book is a great companion to the Babywise series, which I would also highly recommend!!",1335571200,,411,4.453333333333333
8109556,5,B000EGI2IC,"It presented lots of good advices and suggestions that every new mother should hear but will NOT getting them from most doctors in the present time. Doctors are too busy now. I wish I had the DVD 6 months ago for my son and daughter-in-law. They haven't had a good night sleep since the baby was born and are still exhausted. I hope they can retrain their baby soon. I wish there are more DVDs in Dr. Denmark's routine series--such as  2-3 year olds, 4-5 year olds, school age children and all through teenagers!!!",1306886400,,514,4.468085106382978
8109557,3,B000EGI2IC,"Stick with the book, ""Dr. Denmark Said It.""  This video goes through information regarding the importance of a baby's schedule, how to position the baby when sleeping and what to feed up to 2 years. There are several demonstrations like how to blend your baby food and how to make up the crib.  It also has some special biographical clips of Dr. Denmark.  With a better camera and a just a little more time spent on production, this could have been so much better from a technical aspect.  The presenters are good, but good luck trying to get your hubby to sit through this, the music alone is enough to make them walk out. I've passed my copies on to expecting friends with the warning, ""It looks really dated (with the exception of Dr. Denmark's clips which are historical), but the info is good and worth sitting through.""",1279584000,,825,4.554054054054054
8109558,5,B000EGI2IC,Great information.  We are using the schedule and techniques from the program and are very satisfied.,1264982400,,101,5.3125
8109559,1,B000EGI2IC,"Dr. Denmark helped develop the pertussis vaccine in the 1930s -- that's noble. However, I think the ideas contained in this DVD are dangerous. This video suggests feeding your baby every four hours and how its normal for a baby to cry from 2pm to 10pm every day (!). The suggestions in this video -- leave your baby to sleep on their stomach and no variance in feeding times for breastfeeding (babies digest breastmilk faster than formula, and may need to be fed more often) -- contradict the latest scientific research. If you follow the method outlined in this video, your baby will cry from hunger and neglect. And your baby will sleep -- from lack of calories and sheer exhaustion from trying to tell you that they're starving. I feel sorry for the women depicted in this video who seem well-intentioned and are looking for guidance. If new parents are looking for a baby routine to follow, this is not it. This DVD contains dangerous advice -- I'm shocked this doctor was allowed to give this particular advice for so long and wasn't kicked out of the American Medical Association. I was exhausted by my newborn and frustrated that my newborn threw a monkey wrench into my time plans -- parenting a baby wasn't going how I planned. I wanted a routine, because I'm a type A adult who thrives on routines myself. That's why I bought this DVD. But when I watched it, I got a rude awakening -- not all doctors are particularly concerned about keeping up with new science that comes out after they leave medical school and they've been issued their medical license. As much as I desperately want to return to my pre-baby routine and level of time management, I'd rather suffer a little longer (given that I'm the adult and I know I can hang in there a little longer) than subject my baby to these ideas, which seem like they are from the Dark Ages to me. Why not serve up formula in a lead-painted cup too, which were ALSO around at the time Dr. Denmark started practicing medicine. Every parent really has to decide for themselves whose advice they are going to listen to.",1252886400,7,2073,4.560321715817694
8109560,5,B000EGI2IC,"This DVD saved our lives. I only wish i had watch it before my little boy was born. It covers useful information about crying and sleeping issue,how important it is to set up the feeing routine for babies...It really worked for my baby. Now he can sleep longer and he's happier. Dr. Denmark is amazing!! I encourage everyone to buy it, it is a life-saver!!",1207267200,,356,4.492307692307692
