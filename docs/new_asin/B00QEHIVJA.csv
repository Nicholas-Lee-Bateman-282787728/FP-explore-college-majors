8691079,2,B00QEHIVJA,"Jay (James Buckley) is in Australia and sends our group a text message filled with male fantasies and lies about his situation. Our group somehow gets the funds for a surprise visit where they discover that Jay lied to them. While there, Will (Simon Bird) miraculously bumps into Katie (Emily Berrington) who saves their vacation by introducing the group to her friends and places to go.

This is another crude teen sex comedy. The humor is sexual and lacks any intellect. It is for kids who think talking about sex in the crudest fashion is cool and funny. It is a film I would have loved at one time, but have long out grown.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Crude sex talk and gestures. 5 stars for the immaturers. 2 stars for the rest.",1417392000,,744,4.544776119402985
