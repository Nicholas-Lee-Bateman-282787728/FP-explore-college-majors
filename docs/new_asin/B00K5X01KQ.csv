8656116,3,B00K5X01KQ,"Not so brilliant! I really like you guys and your enthusiasm and the sone rise program idea concept- Raun's new book is great and very helpful.  However, this DVD as well as Raun's DVD I've purchased so far are a little overpiriced. Some of your activities are just hard to organize for working parents with little preparation time . Also, I did not really think of your activities as very innovative- apart from the velcro band- That's a good one, I have to admit.  I wish I had your enthusiasm though. Some of your activities are way too exiting and my child gets easily over-exited from such games to start with. The interaction is present, however my problem is calming down the child, after getting too exited, in order to request things from him. Thanks though!",1409788800,8,767,4.632352941176471
8656117,5,B00K5X01KQ,"These DVDs are amazing. Not only packed full of ideas to uses in playroom but demonstrations of how to add developmental goals to activities. Best explanation of recognizing green lights and how to shift from ""joining"". The recommended playroom toy list and ideas for creative use is great. I will definitely revamp what toys we've been using. Visually see the 3 ""Es"" in action. You'll be so excited to get in the playroom with your child. If your struggling at all in the playroom you need to get this.",1407283200,2,503,4.662921348314606

8656119,5,B00K5X01KQ,"This DVD will help you tap into how much fun it can be to help your child with Autism. And, there is no reason for you and your child not to have fun! I have seen the Son-Rise Program help so many children from all over the world and this DVD will help you learn how to do the same. You will see how easy it is to use your child's motivations in order to help them with important social skills. You will not regret your purchase!!",1401753600,,430,3.954022988505747
