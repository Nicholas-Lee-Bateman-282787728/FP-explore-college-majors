588565,5,6303182402,Is this the step aroebic tape with Donna Richardson,1015286400,,51,4.777777777777778
588566,5,6303182402,"This video includes a 5 minute warm-up, 30 minute step divided into two combinations, and about a 5 minute cool down.  Although the step workout is only 30 minutes, it is one of the most energetic I use!  On one level, this video is a good beginners tape. Tamilee Webb does an excellent explaining the moves and even moves to the front of her step so that she steps on the same foot as the viewer during the routines (some beginners may have difficulty understanding how to ""mirror"" the steppers on the screen).  The workout is also challenging for the beginner.  It offers a lot of arm movements and optional moves such as pivot turns and lunges. It is also a super workout for the advanced because almost every move can easily turn into a power step move by adding propulsion. For example, one move has the steppers stepping over the top three times on one end of the step, walking around the step, and stepping over the top on the other end.  An advanced stepper can hop each time over the top and, instead of walking around the step, leap into a half turn or scissor move and hop over the top on the other end.  I use many different step videos and work out with them 4-7 days a week, and I really feel it after this workout! The music is a little strange, but I've gotten used to it.  It is also obvious which of the two background steppers is Tamilee's favorite, which I find a little humorous.",1015027200,16,1400,4.340996168582375
588567,3,6303182402,"This tape is a challenge.  It got my heart beat up, I sweated and I felt good but this tape is also very repetitive.  The same moves are done over and over and then Tamilee reverses her position on the step and does the same moves from the beginning all over again!  This a great tape for someone who is familiar with the step and more advanced than begiiner but beware that the same moves are done over and over and can lead to boredom.",1007510400,6,437,4.117647058823529
7840126,5,6303182402,"Honestly, the video was of very poor quality and works sporadically. I'm giving a high rating because months after my purchase the seller gave me a for refund for this product. I do love this step workout and have been using it for many years. I find it fun and challenging and when pared with some floor exercises after the workout, very adequate. My old video is having the same problems this new video has & I know it's not my VCR since I have other vhs tapes. Again, I appreciate the seller's immediate response when I informed them that it has not been working properly since day one.",1513728000,,589,4.412844036697248
7840127,5,6303182402,Is there anyway possible to get buns of steel 7 on DVDs. I'm only seeing it on vhs!,1489881600,,83,3.6666666666666665
7840128,5,6303182402,"I love this workout, but I wish they had it available on a DVD.  I had to find an old VHS/DVD player in my storage in order to play it.",1399420800,,135,3.5
7840129,5,6303182402,"When workouts were professional and effective! I was initially peaved that I couldn't get this on DVD since I remember I got great results from this workout years ago.  Tamilee  gently yet firmly encourages you through the entire workout while explaining why each move is effective.  She never yells, never rushes through new steps, so you know just what to expect while doing this tape. It is challenging enough and the perfect balance between simplicity and interesting.  I dug up an old VHS player and felt compelled to resort to this older workout since I have found more modern teachers to be obnoxiously loud, and expect the viewer to be a mind reader when it comes to a new routine.  To be frank, these come latelys don't seem to be impressive physique wise either.  I find it really hard to get inspired while working out to a tape where the instructor isn't pulled in or cut; the true test of fitness accomplishment.  I recommend all Tamilee Webbs workouts in addition to the older ""The Firm"" workouts for the same reasons. Both approach exercising from a more factual, scientific perspective.",1394668800,,1102,4.798941798941799
7840130,5,6303182402,on time and as advertised. i think this is a decent dealer and would buy from him/her again. am satisfied with merchandise,1381017600,,122,4.590909090909091
7840131,5,6303182402,"Tamilee is a good instructor.  I found this vhs in one of my old storage boxes and thought, ""why not?""  I like to throw different workouts in to my weekly routine.  After I did Jillians 30DayShred, level 3 this morning - I had breakfast, cleaned the house and then did this step workout.  I was sweating and felt great!  I am keeping this in the ""extra workouts"" stack to add to my routine now and then - at least twice a month.  I'd prefer it if this was on dvd.",1363219200,,463,4.088888888888889
7840132,5,6303182402,This is an excellent tape and I have missed using it.  Replaced it after several years as I had lost my other one.  Tammy is great and each workout is about 15 minutes with 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down to total 40 minutes.  Just right for a quick yet effective workout for all levels.,1312502400,,295,4.051724137931035
7840133,1,6303182402,"I received this VHS and put it in my player, and I could barely see it.  It was incredibly fuzzy--very poor quality.  I didn't bother to return it since it was just a dollar, but I can't use it.  I was really disappointed.",1234137600,,222,4.116279069767442
7840134,1,6303182402,"I love tamilee but this video is soo boring.  My buns don't feel at all sore.  It was a nice cardio workout but thats about it. I was hoping for more bun work since it is called BUNS of steel.

I couldn't wait for the tape to be over. Ill never do it again, cause altho the cardio was good, i have dozens of step cardio tapes that are much more interesting  :(",1139356800,,360,3.8904109589041096
7840135,4,6303182402,"I like this video, yes it's a little dated and it's not the toughest routine in the world but I always get a good workout with this video.  Tamilee Webb leads you through a 40 minute step routine along with 2 background exercisers, Lori who shows some easier modifications, and Megan who is the advanced stepper and uses a higher platform.  They are dressed in animal print outfits and are in the same drab setting as most of the Buns of Steel workouts are filmed.  But for me it doesn't take away from the workout at all.

You start out with a simple warmup where the step is used for part of it, a brief stretch follows before going into the first combination of the workout.

The first combination builds gradually starting with alternating knee lifts, then raising the opposite arm once each, then both arms which gets a little tricky sometimes, I usually raise the wrong arm a few times but I don't stress over it, Tamilee actually does it once herself.  Then you will do tap up/downs to one corner then the other adding opposition arms to it.  After you have that down you will add over the tops, then walking around the platform to the other side.  You will repeat each part a few times before adding a piece to it.  Later on Tamilee adds lunges onto the step in place of the tap up/downs.  I stick with the taps myself for this part.  The final part that is added is a pivot turn on the last lunge.  This is repeated several times as the combination is building and you will change lead legs each time which can get a little confusing.

The second combination starts with the alternating knee lifts again, but this time you will go into alternating L-steps on each side along with assorted arms movements.  Then you start adding on with a 4 count march into a side squat first, then a tap up/down into hip extensions.  The last part of the combination returns to the alternating knee lifts with a basic step inserted.  Tamilee shows a optional variation of this part later where you do a quarter turn and you are straddling over the step while doing the knee lifts, etc.  Again this combination is repeated often as parts are gradually added.  Tamilee ends the workout by taking you through both combinations a couple more times.  Then you cooldown and do some stretching.

What is helpful with this routine besides the gradual building of the combinations, is that Tamilee will occasionally step over to the other side and do the routine from the same viewpoint as you so you know exactly where your feet need to be.  This is helpful as you are learning the routine.  She also points out that you are mirroring them throughout.

This is a good workout, worth the money if you can find a copy used. Tamilee does a nice job with this one, she is enthusiastic, energetic and seems to be having fun as do her background exercisers.  Plus I enjoy the music too, seems to have a Caribbean flair to it, fit the workout well.  Recommended.",1126396800,7,2940,4.491525423728813
