7802284,4,3865381006,"We like the boxed set.  However, the person who plays the little girl has a British accent.  My students (many of whom I had last year) remember the voices of the Horrible Histories we watched last year.  There was no girl with a British accent.  It is a bit distracting but you do get used to her.",1396742400,,298,4.175438596491228
7802285,2,3865381006,I thought this was the live action version of the program from the UK which my children and I love. Not so. This is a cartoon rip off. Not nearly as witty as the live action. Snarky and crude. Blech. I will be donating it asap.,1381190400,7,227,3.9565217391304346
7802286,5,3865381006,The DVD set works perfectly fine on a PC. There is a specialized Region code though and it will not play in a standalone DVD player. I was aware of this when I bought it and there was a reminder on the packaging. This version is a UK production so some of the characters voices have accents from countries there. All info is the same as American version. Great show. My 6th grade students love them! They complement my social studies class wonderfully!,1372464000,4,452,4.457831325301205
7802287,5,3865381006,"My niece and nephew loved these episodes.  They wanted to watch them over and over again.  Teaches them some history and interesting for adults, too.",1368144000,,149,4.92
7802288,5,3865381006,a fun way to learn about important people and events in history. kids don't even know they are being taught while watching. my kids (10-5) watch 3 episodes in a sitting. great stuff just be aware you need at euro stlye dvd player to run them.,1356480000,,242,4.282608695652174
7802289,5,3865381006,"A brand new 3-DVD Box Set. I love this show ever since 2008. It's funny, teaching and HQ video. You be regret!! ;-)",1354924800,,115,4.043478260869565
7802290,5,3865381006,"Some computers may require special players.  Mine did work on the standard Windows Media Player as well as the VLC player. Great series that is good for kids but won't work in your DVD player unless it is coded for the British region.

IMPORTANT:
If you watched the series in the US and are looking for that version, the US series had a different narrator and voice for the girl character Moe. They have British accents (not surprising).  I bought this for school not realizing there would be different narration, but it does not detract much from the content. However, they do use some other terms like pounds instead of dollars. If you are looking for the US version, this is different but still excellent and entertaining!",1350000000,,725,4.692913385826771
7802291,5,3865381006,"I first discovered this amazing show during my recent trip to Australia. I absolutely loved it, and couldn't wait to turn others on to it when I got back to the States. I am greatly disappointed, however, to discover that it doesn't seem to be available in USA format. What's up with that? PLEASE, whoever is responsible for creating the boxed sets of DVDs--make them available in USA format ASAP!",1322352000,24,397,4.685714285714286
7802292,5,3865381006,"The product arrived before the predicted date.  It was in pretty good condition.  There was some damage to part of the case but , the DVDs are in excellent condition.  The interest in history that it sparks with the kids and the enjoyment they get from watching the DVDs is priceless.",1306281600,4,284,4.529411764705882
