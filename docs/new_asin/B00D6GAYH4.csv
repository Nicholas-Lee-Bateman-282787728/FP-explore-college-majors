8589883,1,B00D6GAYH4,"This was a very poor trapping DVD in my opinion.  The vast majority of the video is watching John Cagnon walk around in the woods.  There's not much footage of him putting in sets or getting catches, and the ones that do happen are filmed very poorly.  There is almost no instruction and virtually no discussion of why he did things the way he did.  I didn't feel like I learned a thing from this video.  Every other DVD I have seen and book I've read has been better.",1447027200,,468,4.213483146067416
