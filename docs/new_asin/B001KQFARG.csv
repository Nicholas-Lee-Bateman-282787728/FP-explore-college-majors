8315858,5,B001KQFARG,A great movie. I'm lucky someone suggested this movie. Its wonderful and uplifting. Definitely a keeper on my Spiritual movies shelf.,1390262400,,133,5.380952380952381
8315859,5,B001KQFARG,"The negative reviews are totally unfounded. True, this movie is flawed, contrived, and ""Hollywood"" at times, but I can give it no less that 5 stars for both its style and its substance.  Stylistically, it is nothing short of a visual marvel with its many gorgeous images of the beautiful Hindu rituals, the exotic and lovely Indian houses and scenery, and the equally exotic and lovely Hindu and Muslim hairstyles and modes of dress.  Substantially, I was reduced to tears at the end of the movie by the film's simple yet profound reduction of dharm (religion)to tolerance, non-violence, justice, and most of all, love.

As an aspie, I am odd person.  Not surprisingly, my religion is quite odd as well.  I consider myself a Christobuddhist with hints of Islamic Sufism and Vedantic Hinduism also as part of my faith.  I hold to my mode of liberal spirituality intensely and consider myself an extremely religious person.  This film is not just for ecclectic weirdos like me, but for all passionately religious folks who feel God is love and vice versa.  To Muslims who read this I say, ""Salaam""; to Jews, ""Shalom""; to Hindus, ""Shanti""; to Catholic Christians, ""Pax""; and to all others (including atheists}, ""Peace"" or whatever the equivalent is in your native language.  This movie was an absolute feast of peace and love to me, and it is my earnest prayer that others experience this amazingly moving film as well.",1332979200,4,1416,4.866666666666666
8315860,5,B001KQFARG,"Phenomenal performance by Pankaj Kapoor is the asset of this movie. The shock this orthodox Hindu priest character experiences when he finds out that the child he is raising is the biological offspring of a Muslim woman is remarkable. The actor has done a wonderful job portraying his part. The movie is about religion differences than caste differences. This is an essentially unique plot and eye-opener for much of the Indian and non-Indian audiences of all religions. Should this happen to them, they will be shocked beyond belief, just like the Chathurvedi priest character in the film.

The film would not have been a success without the melodious voice of singer Sonu Nigam. His opening song is the very best in the movie. All other singers have done an excellent job, too.",1263945600,11,779,4.901515151515151
8315861,3,B001KQFARG,"Dharm is a rather weak effort to explore the relationship between religious form and function through the story of Pandit Chaturvedi, a venerable and somewhat smug Brahmin who adopts a boy believing him to be from a Brahmin family.  When several years later the boy's Muslim birth mother shows up, Chaturvedi is racked with shame and tries desperately to recover his standing in the community through painful penances.  But when communal violence threatens the life of his adopted and now estranged son, he begins to understand another side to religion.

Pankaj Kapoor puts in a strong performance as Chaturvedi, but the rest of the film is rather feeble, typical of commercial Indian cinema where the characters are little more than two dimensional puppets dancing through contrived circumstances.  Many interesting issues crop up - Hindu fundamentalism, xenophobia, misogyny, caste discrimination - but are never explored.  A facile ending leaves us to wonder if Chaturvedi has really learned anything at all.
