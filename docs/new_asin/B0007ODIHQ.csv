2224481,5,B0007ODIHQ,My 8-year old daughter is on her third year of AYSO soccer this year.  She loved watching the video and right away wanted to grab her ball and start practicing some of the techniques.  I believe it provides more than enough dribbling drills to keep a child in this age group challenged.  It also motivates them to watch how good experienced players can become.  The video footage is clear and easy to watch and the narrator speaks slowly and is easy to follow.  The variety of genders and age groups in the player/demonstrators keeps all age groups engaged.,1287360000,,557,4.642857142857143
2224482,5,B0007ODIHQ,"How often do we get to combine insight into a sport

2224483,5,B0007ODIHQ,"SOCCER  FAST FOOTWORK DRILLS shows why fundamentals are key at all levels of soccer play.
Michael Jordan used to practice dribbling for hours. Derek Jeter practices his fielding range everyday.
It is no coincidence that the premier athletes are fundamentally sound players.
This should translate to players at most levels and we soccer coaches and parents need to motivate
these players to see why basic soccer fast footwork skills are important.
This video really does a very good job explaining the skills that players need to succeed.
Highly recommended!

I am always suspicious of videos or books that are getting
unbelievable 5 star reviews. Is the author or producer
part of a large extended family? Does Amazon own a percentage?
Well this program, SOCCER FAST FOOTWORK DRILLS is perhaps the best
program in a very good series of soccer videos. Footwork skills will translate
into excellent shooting opportunities. This program fits
a wide variety of soccer programs including recreational
up to the most competitive school team.
Parents will also gain valuable teaching techniques.
