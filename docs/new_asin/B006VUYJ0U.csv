8505138,1,B006VUYJ0U,"Wow! Warner Bros went all out on this Looney Tunes DVD. Only 3 shorts running about 20 minutes!

The shorts are:

Apes of Wrath
Stork Naked
Bad Ol' Putty Tat

I have to admit that I do like the cool DVD cover, it is just the lack of content that bothers me. I mean only three shorts! And they have have all been released on other Looney Tunes DVDs. I recommend either the Golden Collections or the Spotlight Collections and avoid this release.",1347753600,9,443,4.313253012048193
8505139,2,B006VUYJ0U,"When it has came down the Looney Tunes on video, there just have been a lack of stand-out DVD's that work just like the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection Volumes 1-6. So they have now decided to do mini-collections that have not thrived to make them worth buying. With The Looney Tunes: Unleashed, it is quite honestly the worst DVD collection of Looney Tunes on home video. There are only 3 of the classic cartoons from Bugs Bunny, Tweety & Sylvester and Daffy Duck on this collection. The DVD features 3 shorts, Bad Ol' Putty Tat, Stork Naked, and Apes Of Wrath. The cartoons each are still funny today, like they were made around 60 years ago. While the idea was there, the gripe is it isn't worth the money. There are better DVD's out there for new and die hard looney tunes fans worth the money, but Looney Tunes: Unleashed, will possibly be worth turning your back on.

Price: D-

Shorts: C+

8505140,1,B006VUYJ0U,"Warners has hit rock bottom here!  Wasting a whole DVD with just 20 minutes of cartoons!

It is not like they are paying any real residuals to release these, none of the creators are making any big money off of this, Just Warner Brothers.

Here are the meager offerings:

""Apes of Wrath,"" - Bugs Bunny - 7 minutes
""Stork Naked"" - Daffy Duck - 7 minutes
""Bad Ol' Putty Tat."" - Tweety & Sylvester - 7 minutes

NOBODY SHOULD BUY THIS when there are better, affordable Looney Tunes DVD sets out there!",1328400000,15,497,4.358695652173913
