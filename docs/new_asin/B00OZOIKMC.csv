8685853,5,B00OZOIKMC,"I saw this on PBS, or most of it anyway (PBS only shows a little less than an hour of it) but this is a revelation, they have done a wonderful job transfering the video and audio to DVD (the PBS showing is pretty low quality on the video) this is so good that it could be mistaken for something just recorded, not a standard studio video tape made in 1983, and the music, well it's Liberace, nobody plays music the way he does, he never plays anything straight as written, he leaves his own imprint on every song (this is not a bad thing) playing with an uplifting beat, Liberace starts the evening with some classical fair, when he announces he will be playing calssical music it isn't greated with a lot of enthusiasm, but when he finishes the set he has the audience in the palm of his hand, every set from there on gets the audience more and more involved, and when he plays chopsticks the crowd goes wild, closing the show with audience favorites tops it all, the last song is Beer Barrel Polka, buy this time if you arn't jumping up and dancing, or at least tapping your feet and jiggeling in your seat, you must be musically dead",1433980800,2,1136,4.313084112149533
