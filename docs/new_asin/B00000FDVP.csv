I played the character Nutty in this film, oddly enough this name has gone on to haunt me throughout my personal and professional life.  To answer some of the questions I am asked daily about this film, No, we are not planning a sequel, but I have heard the BlueRay release is in works.  Also, yes, I have heard it rumored that the film ""Avatar"" was loosely based on this film, however I am still failing to see the connection.  Last but not least, No, I am no longer working in the film industry, however I can be booked for motivational speaking engagements, and I am currently producing and starring in a new dance instruction video.  Once again, thanks for all the constant and overwhelming fan mail, and it is always great to hear from fans of the film.  As always, have a very Merry Christmas!",1274400000,3,984,4.531073446327683
7908242,5,B00000FDVP,"This is a must have for any fan of Christmas Movies.  It is rare that a movie will get my eyes to water, but this classic is a tear jerker.  This movie is set in depression era Louisiana and captures the essence of Christmas.  Nutty's role should have definately been expanded and explored at a greater depth.  A true Danny Glover/Aaron Bohl classic.  I do hope I can get my hands on a rare DVD copy someday.",1273795200,3,408,4.246753246753247
7908243,5,B00000FDVP,"The plot was as good as the acting, which was as good as the lighting, sets and sound.  Aaron Bohl, as ""Nutty,"" truly missed his calling as a professional actor.  You will spend the entire movie on the edge of your seat, wondering where the plot is going with the vicious and elusive panther, played convincingly by a Latin American jaguar.  Renfroe's White Christmas may truly ruin all other Christmas movies for you.",1273708800,3,418,4.698630136986301
7908244,5,B00000FDVP,Outstanding movie for any Danny Glover fan!  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an action packed good time movie during the Christmas Season.,1273622400,3,164,4.857142857142857
