1547982,5,B00005JOZI,"A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized ""United 93"". At once speculative and realistic, the 111-minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 9/11, but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.

As it turns out, Greengrass's heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment, as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either under-the-radar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the real-life characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus, which a more commercial filmmaker would have done, he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film, including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently, we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That's not to say it is any less devastating. In fact, the last half-hour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.

The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just-promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. It also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense, such controversy is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point. This is truly essential viewing.",1146182400,34,2209,5.133333333333334
1547983,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 - A

Director Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible. He has made a tasteful, powerful, emotional, great and above all else respectful movie on one of the events that transpired on September 11th 2001.

You all know what this movie is about so there is no need to explain it. The movie begins in the early morning hours of September 11th 2001 in the hotel room of the terrorists who hijack flight United 93. We follow them from there to the airport, to the plane, through the hijacking and right to the end. Everything in this movie is done respectfully and tastefully. There are no cartoonish bad guys, nor are there any Bruce Willis or Wesley Snipes type heroes. The music doesn't swell up or have violins playing in the background when the crew rebels. There are no dramatic slow motion shots either. This is a real movie plain and simple.

The acting in this movie is surprisingly great. All the actors in this are unknowns and this helps in a big big way. If we has Nicholas Cage or Brad Pitt in this movie then that would detract from is severely. We'd look at it and know that they are acting. With the unknowns though, they feel like regular people in a terrible situation. They all give great, convincing performances and really pull you in to the movie, yes even the terrorists do. There is not one main character we follow either, rather it is symbolic of the title; they are all United as one and we care for them individually as well as a whole. We don't get to know them deeply but that doesn't deter because, essentially they are us. You get to know them gradually throughout the movie though.

The music is a truly spectacular aspect of this film. As I said earlier, it isn't overly dramatic nor is it all heroic and such. It is absolutely perfect for this movie; the composer couldn't have done a better job. It's especially wonderful near the end though, truly spectacular.

Greengrass uses a lot of handheld camera work here; most of the movie is in handheld format. This helps us get sucked in to the situation even more because we feel as though we are spectators and going through what the crew and passengers went through. It's very effective and it never gets annoying. Some complain that handheld cameras give them motion sickness, but if it's in the hands of the right director it works great (Mann is a good example) and Greengrass shows he is one of the ones who make it work.

The visual effects are good, for the sparse amount there are in the films. Most of them are just the outlook of the plane windows but they never look hokey or out of place. They seem very natural.

The imagery in this movie is wonderful. It doesn't go overboard exploiting everything that happened nor does it wallow in itself by saying ""Hey, I'm a 9/11 movie, watch how I show all the horrible images we've seen over the past 4.5 years!"" It shows what it needs to. It shows a news report of the second plane hitting, it shows the WTC in the background, smoking. It does not however show the buildings collapse nor does it show the plane exploding. It reminds us of why this is such an important event in our history, why we should never forget it. Greengrass knows that we lived through this and doesn't overdue the graphic-ness (for lack of a better word) of this subject, but he also shows enough and tells enough that future generations will be able to watch this movie and grasp what their Parents and Grandparents experienced that fateful September morning in 2001.

The ending to this movie is absolutely perfect. It ends in a perfect way; right when it should end. It ends right where you expect it too as well. It ends with the plane crashing. The crash is a first person outlook from the cockpit and the ground is spiraling toward you and you really get a great sense of how fast they were really going. Right before it hits, the screen goes to black for about 5 or so seconds. Then text appears explaining what happened following the crash and the text changes about three times before saying that this movie is dedicated to all those who lost their lives on September 11th 2001. You really have to see it though; it's quite moving and is quite simply the perfect way to end this movie.

United 93 is a spectacular movie. This is truly a movie for everyone. Everybody should see it, maybe not right now cause I know some people aren't ready to relive 9/11 quite yet and some think it's too early for a movie like this, but everyone should see it one day. These passengers and the crew struck the first blow in the war against terror, they were true patriots and I commend Greengrass because he didn't make this movie for money (even if that was the studio's intention) nor did he exploit the victims of this event. He made it to tell a story, a very important story of what happened 4 and a half years ago. He showed us how heroic these people are and that America is a strong nation. Honestly, I've never been more proud to be an American.",1146182400,21,4978,4.461538461538462
1547984,4,B00005JOZI,"Paul Greengrass has made some terrific movies: ""The Bourne Supremacy"" for one and the documentary ""Bloody Sunday"" for another. In his re-telling of the chilling and poignant story of the passengers on that fateful flight ""United 93,"" he once again has produced a detailed, obviously carefully researched story that shows us probably more than we actually want to see: for so much of it is painfully personal and tragic.
One interesting choice that Greengrass makes is to stay away, almost completely, from naming anyone on board the airplane. He chooses instead to treat those that successfully overrun the terrorists as a whole: a democratic them against us mentality that robs us from completely investing emotionally in any one in particular. It's a bold move but also one that distances rather than brings us closer.
""United 93"" begins very matter-of factly: the four terrorists going about their ritual cleansing and prayer in preparation of their horrible deed, at the airport people standing in line waiting to check in, the ground crew preparing the plane, the pilots and attendants kibitzing: very calm, very ordinary...only the terrorists know what is to occur. But more to the point, the ordinary passengers on flight 93 returning home, on a business trip, on vacation who think they are boarding a routine flight, have no idea what they will be forced to endure and to what they will be asked to react. Therein lays the drama of this film: people like you and I transformed, out of necessity and circumstances beyond our control, into heroes.
Greengrass films this story as close to real time as possible. The drama unfolds as it happens and the film's genius is that none of this feels manipulated: when the owlish, round-faced passenger says ""no one is going to help us...we must do this ourselves"" the action unravels naturally...without pretense without manufactured ""drama.""
""United 93"" is on many levels horrifying, upsetting and depressing. Yet out of all of this, because it is so well made and acted, let's hope that the survivors of those killed will get at least a small measure of closure if not the release of a full blown catharsis.",1146182400,16,2158,4.980609418282548
1547985,5,B00005JOZI,"Whoever says it is too soon for this movie doesn't know their history. The first movie about Pearl Harbour wasn't made 5 years after the fact, it was 6 months after the attack. People need to be reminded of the horror and the heroism of September 11th. America is a nation of short term memory spans. If it didn't happen yesterday or last week people forget. We think ""How horrible, I hope we get those[...]A week later they get on with their lives and begin to wonder what's the fuss over Osama, terrorists, and just bad stuff that happen to other people in different states or countries.

1547986,5,B00005JOZI,"At first I didn't think I could watch this film (a sneak preview), it was a horrendous day for everyone in the USA . At last, I  prepared myself to  watch United 93. This is a frightening reenactment  of what could have happened on the airplane that didn't make it's intended attack on Washington DC. It has always been easy for me to sit thru a fictional horror film or thriller. Because we know it is make believe and it is for entertainment. This movie strikes a new chord on the human soul. I didn't think I could handle it. But I am glad I did choose to see it. There were people who thought  this movie should not be released.

Let me assure you. You will not leave the film depressed. It is uplifting in a way. Because of the heroic actions of the Americans in the film. It makes you proud to be an American. I highly recommend seeing it. Even for the families of the people on the plane. The director turns each passenger into a hero. It won't be easy to watch. But you really shouldn't turn away from this film.",1146096000,75,1020,4.21025641025641

1547988,5,B00005JOZI,"September 11th 2001, 4 planes were hijacked, 3 of them reached their targets, UNITED 93 is the story of the forth.

JFK said ""We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth."" After 9/11, many artists chose to respond to the horror and tragedy of the events  in the way they knew best - through their craft.  They drew their own line offering  photographs, sculpture, paintings, poetry,  and film that commemorate that day.  Their work, good or bad, will forever be a part of those events. So timing and quality is important. At just under 5 years since the destruction of the Twin Towers in NYC, and the crash of United 93 in a Pennsylvania field, is the time right. Maybe, it will never be right. ""the Flight of United 93,""  although approved by the familes of the passagers, might be a story not yet ready to be told, or more accurately it might be a story not ready to be heard and seen. With public opinion of the handling of the War down, maybe the time is right for a film that depicts the courageous actions of passengers on the fourth hijacked plane.

 Director Paul Greengrass thoughtfully undertakes the unenviable task of telling this pivotal chapter in the events of that tragic day. Greengrass, director of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY shoots UNITED 93 almost virtually in realtime as all 40 passengers and crew gather the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 to board United's flight from Newark to San Francisco. Along with the 40, are 5 men planning to use the plane as a weapon against the U.S. Capitol. Once it ""becomes clear"" that a hijacking has occurred passengers begin to sneak mobile calls, saying their goodbyes, but also discovering that 2 planes have already been rammed into the World Trade Center, confirming their worst fears. The passengers see no other choice than to risk confronting the hijackers to gain control of the plane. Greengrass, along with his superb cast and crew, reconstruct the events from factual information gained from cell calls, flight recorders,  the memories of families and ground controllers. Casting of mostly unknowns adds weight to the film, intensifying the haunting reality of the situation.

This is no TV movie of the week. It is urgent, edgy, moving and ultimately a fitting memorial for the heroic passengers of flight United 93.

Approved by the families of the passengers, a portion of proceeds goes to the FLIGHT 93 MEMORIAL FUND [...] The film was well received when it premiered at the Tribeca Film festival.

Rated R for language and scenes of terror and violence.",1146096000,205,2551,4.7313769751693

1548254,5,B00005JOZI,"I first saw the film United 93 when it was released in 2006. Since this was the first dramatic film about 9/11  the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001  I was curious to see how Hollywood would treat this sensitive subject. Would moviemakers treat this tragedy in their usual histrionic fashion, making it an exercise in crass commercialism or would they seek to honor the victims in a more subdued, historically accurate manner?

Fortunately for all concerned, director Paul Greengrass and his production team chose the latter course, thereby creating an outstanding film that dramatizes the events of that day while at the same time honoring every one of the 40 innocent souls who lost their lives aboard United Airlines Flight 93.

United 93 presents a clear timeline of events aboard the doomed jetliner from the time passengers, crew members, and four terrorists boarded in Newark, New Jersey until the moment it crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  Much of what is dramatized is based on transcripts of radio transmissions and telephone calls, and recalls the heroic efforts of passengers and crew to reclaim the aircraft from the terrorists who had hijacked it.

The film also gives an account of  the larger tragedy unfolding in the skies at the same time.  Air traffic controllers hear garbled radio transmissions from three other hijacked aircraft and report their suspicions to supervisors. The Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Air Force struggle to sift through frequently confusing and faulty information in their efforts to keep abreast of the situation, and make correct decisions on how to best respond.

United 93 has a realistic, almost documentary feel to it. The acting by its fine ensemble cast is  subdued and very natural. (Actors selected to portray passengers and crew met with family members prior to filming, and several other cast members were participants in the actual events of the day. They included air traffic controllers, U.S. Air Force command and control officers, and even the then FAA Director of Operations.)

The Blu-ray edition of United 93 includes the feature film (presented with outstanding 1080p video and DTS Master Audio quality) and a host of excellent special features. The bonus material includes a documentary about the families of the United 93 passengers and crew, and another film that documents the events of the day as told my many of the participants.

Ive seen other films with 9/11 at their subject matter, and none of them are anywhere near as good as United 93.  Even now, fifteen years after 9/11, this is a difficult and harrowing film to watch. But it should be seen by everyone. Most highly recommended.",1467763200,8,2720,5.071748878923767

Boarded in Newark, N.J., the flight was a non-stop 5 hour and 25 minute destined for San Francisco. Once in the air, the pilot and copilot were vitiated. The lead hijacker, in the pilot's seat, affixed a picture of the U.S. Capitol Building on the dashboard in front of him, making it his visual target. The passengers, through cell phone calls to loved ones, were informed of the hijackings that struck the WTC. Their only choice, albeit extremely courageous, was to take control of the aircraft. One of the passengers had experience as a pilot with a single engine plane, and their imperative was to get him in the cockpit. Another passenger had eight years experience working as an air traffic controller and could instruct him in landing it.

From the military not being in a position to do anything to the FAA being forced to just sit back and watch. The nation was powerless to stop this that morning. But a few people on United Airlines flight 93 weren't. They decided their plane wasn't going to hit a 4th target that morning. And they stopped it. The exact details of how they did it will never be known. But this movie makes a pretty likely guess at the general nature of events on that plane.

Those heroes on that plane died that day trying to retake the aircraft. But no one else on the ground lost their lives thanks to their actions.

The movie itself is wonderfully made. It's shot with a lot of handheld cameras, giving the viewer an ""on the scene"" perspective.

Much of the case, aside from the people on the airplane, are not actors. They are the actual people from that day recreating their actions. I saw this movie in the theater the day it opened. It recreated in me every single emotion I felt in 2001. 14 years after that fateful day, United 93 still does that to me.

If you haven't seen this, you need to. It's worth getting the DVD over the instant video. The DVD special features includes a documentary interviewing the families of the flight 93 passengers, including how the actors playing them studied for their roles and how the families approved of the actors' portrayals.",1441929600,2,1667,4.5

The passengers are praying The Lord's Prayer, the highjackers are praying in god's name to kill them.

1548697,4,B00005JOZI,"United 93 is organized and filmed in a documentary fashion, with alternating scenes from Air Traffic Control, a military control room, and the cabin and cockpit of UA93. The handheld, sometimes jittery, film style lends a real-time, intense quality as does the fact that there is no background music. The cast is entirely assembled without any recognizable ""stars"", which also lends an air of authenticity.

Though the scenes on the plane are recreated from logs and phone calls, of course it will never be known exactly what happened during the fatal flight. What seems to be missing, however, is identification of the 4 men that were assumed to have been the leaders among the passengers on the plane, and even the now famous ""Let's roll!"" call when they charged the cockpit. The people on the plane were virtually unidentified and unknown. It would have preferred to know a bit more about them, if only to satisfy my conclusions that they were just like the rest of us - ordinary citizens and that each of us may have had the courage to act in the same manner had we been there.

The hijackers were portrayed as religious but somewhat disorganized and ill-prepared buffoons - probably a simplification given the spectacular devastation that the group of terrorists as a whole were able to inflict on the country.

The chaos of the events that played out within the plane was riveting, but what I found most interesting was the sequence of events on the ground as the controllers and military attempt to make sense out of the developing situation. I still have the 9/11 Commission Report on my bookshelves and intend to eventually reread it.

As the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 hijackings approaches, it occurs to me that there is an entire generation of kids approaching high school that weren't alive then, and have perhaps an unclear understanding, if any, of what occurred that day. I think ""United 93"" will remain a useful and informative film to help make sense of some of the chaos of that day as it fades from our collective memory.",1410220800,2,2043,4.779036827195467

1548755,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 (2006). Rated ""R"". Released April 28, 2006 in the movie theaters.
DVD Running Time: One Hour, 50 mins.  Directed and written by Paul Greengrass.

Based upon the real-life tragic events that shocked the entire citizens of the United States of America on September 11, 2001. If you saw it happening on television LIVE, you were glued to the television set.
  Four airplanes were hi-jacked in the same morning.

At 8:46am, American Airlines Flight 11 (From Boston via LAX) deliberately crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City.

At 9:02am, United Airlines Flight 175 (From Boston via LAX) deliberately crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

At 9:37am, American Airlines Flight 77 (From Virginia via LAX) deliberately crashed into The Pentagon.

At 9:59am, The South Tower completely collapsed to the ground.

Meanwhile, the fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93 was in flight from Newark to San Francisco. It was hi-jacked too. The hijackers made a flight attendant knock on the door for the pilots to open the door. The hijackers took the pilots down. One hijacker took over flying the plane.
  Some of the terrified male passengers got together and decided to do the most bravest act. It was their last hope. They were going to take down the hijackers all at once.
  We all know what happened later as it crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.
  They say this plane may have been intended to crash into the Capitol or The White House in Washington DC.

 This movie is to honor the pilots, flight attendants and passengers who perished and to honor those in the control rooms who tried their damndest.
  This movie is their story.

Cast: Opal Alladin, David Alan Basche, Ray Charleson, Peter Hermann, Joe Jamrog, Christian Clemenson, Polly Adams, Trish Gates, Denny Dillion, Gregg Henry.

1548756,5,B00005JOZI,"Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" is a harrowing, intense docufiction about what apparently happened inside the flight on that fateful day of 9/11 (sadly, a day that many Americans have already put behind them), and the director was brave enough to show the Americans as brave souls who were willing to fight back against the mentally ill cowards who took over the plane for a purpose that I find unspeakable--and eternally unforgivable, period. The film hurtles forward through the old clich of ""real time"", but in this movie it works--the editing, the sound design, the music, the acting, and the violence all work towards a brutalizing but dramatically powerful effect. The film does raise the issue of just exactly what purpose that movies should serve (the touching extra on the suffering of the American families who lost loved ones on that day is especially telling and is a must watch for everyone) today, but the story is so heartbreaking (and to me, upsetting) that it really deserves a hearing despite what my ideas about cinema's function may be. I don't know if it was ethically sound to release a film like this due to the tragedy that accompanied this unfortunate historic incident, but Greengrass isn't afraid to step on toes, and his courting of controversy shows an intrepid sensibility that I admire in filmmakers. But it will be up to you if you find it watchable or simply horrible. In any case, may the world never forget--and never forgive.
The DVD is a great presentation alone, and it has terrific sound and image indeed. The picture is very clear, and I had no trouble with my copy. The widescreen presentation is perfect for catching the intense editing of this film, which helps to enhance its appeal for lovers of suspenseful film construction. I can't say that this film is a pleasant experience (Greengrass does show a talent for riling one to great heights of anger and outrage, and it's hard for me to describe the great filmmaking talent here as a result), but it is necessary viewing for all Americans, and a powerful tribute to the brave men and women who lost their lives on that day.

The entire Middle East is an endless mess. So is Pakistan and Afghanistan. Welcome to the jungle. John McCain wants to help Syria? Let them eat their young.

Going into the theater within about ten minutes I was crying.  And I didn't stop until long after I got home.  It was beautiful and moving.  However to claim one will not leave depressed is a strong claim.  We all have our own reactions and I personally was quite shaken up over it.  I am finally to the point where I would like to see the film again because it was beautiful.

So please do watch it is a great story.  But recognize you are going to have an emotional reaction to the film, or you could be bawling for hours completely unexpectedly as I was.",1363478400,,677,4.178294573643411

I don't find that this documentary tells us anything we didn't know from the media.

My primary objection to the movie is that it is a visual torture, with camera work having the quality of a home movie. Perhaps that was the director's idea of jazzing up the action, but i feel like screaming as the camera keeps jumping, blurring the images, hopping, and dodging for no apparent reason.

First, because we know what is going to happen and are reliving the full horror and dread of that day.  In addition, the director made a wise decision to cast unknown actors and a number of non-actors (such as the flight controllers).  Finally, the story itself - of the passengers coming to the awareness that they are most likely going to die and, without heroics, making sure that the plane isn't a weapon like the prior three - is moving and well-told.",1353369600,,614,4.554545454545455

1548983,5,B00005JOZI,"I can remember the first time I saw ""United 93"" - I was stunned and intensely moved. Released less than five years after the events of September 11, 2001 - the wounds were still raw. Yet the film was sentiment and opinion free - visceral to the extreme - and painfully, brutally honest - and of course all the more admirable for it.

Written and Directed by PAUL GREENGRASS - it had the most difficult material in the world to deal with - fraught with all sorts of depiction dangers and accusations of a crass cash-in. And yet it succeeded on every level. Come the last 15 minutes - your hurt is pretty much uncontrollable and the tears are flowing for real.

It arrived not surprisingly on BLU RAY on the 10th Anniversary of the event (Sept 2011) - and here it is again (June 2012) on a BLU RAY/DVD/DIGITAL DOWNLOAD combo-pack as part of Universal's 100th Anniversary celebrations in the generic card-wrap packaging associated with that huge series of reissues (see comment section for full list). And I'm glad to say it boasts a proper upgrade in picture quality and 'bonus material' which is not just respectful - but equal in power to the movie itself...

It opens with four men in an apartment block. Dressed like a Middle Eastern businessman, the leader of the group squints underneath his immaculately clean reading glasses. But Ziad Jarrah is nervous - and as he breathily chants prayers over his Koran - even seems troubled. But a face that has no such qualms interrupts Ziad. It's Ahmed Al Haznawi - who will later hold the flight at bay with a knife he's smuggled into his belt. The al-Qaeda radical fixes Ziad with a steely gaze and says - ""It's time.""

And so begins their infamous journey - driving to the airport - parking their cars - checking-in with minimal luggage - getting through the security monitors - and eventually boarding ""United 93"" - an early-morning non-stop flight from Newark International to San Francisco. Hours later - 33 passengers and 7 flight crew are fighting back - desperately trying to retake the cockpit from Ziad and Ahmed. But despite their valiant efforts - the Boeing 757 nosedives into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:03 am. And of the four aircraft hijacked and sacrificed that horrible day, it was the only one 'not' to reach Osama Bin Laden's presumed target (The White House, Washington DC).

Why does ""United 93"" work? First up - Greengrass begins with the everyday - the 'ordinary'. In the waiting area - Thomas Burnett makes a business call as he eyes his polished shoes - while a dehydrated Nicole Miller applies lip-gloss once on board. Equally beautiful and seated for take-off, hostess Cee Cee Lyles regrets having not brought enough magazines for her to read on a 5-hour long haul flight - while passengers Patrick Driscoll and his friend William Cashman (70 and 60) plan a hiking holiday to Yosemite National Park from a colour brochure. Hilda Marcin asks politely for a glass of water so she can swallow her medication with her breakfast - while a man opens his laptop on the seat rest in front of him with a relaxed air. A 20-year old Deora Bodley is trying to do just that - she fixes a makeshift pillow on the headrest of her seat - and leaving her headphones in - tries to get some shut-eye. And up in the cockpit while on autopilot - First Officer LeRoy Homer talks to Captain Jason Dahl as they eat their meals from plastic trays about a London holiday he's planning for his wife and their new 11-month old baby. Every scene is humdrum - and of course real - and therefore incredibly unsettling...

Second is the cast. There are no big names in the lead roles (some of the actors are vaguely familiar like Christian Clemenson from ""Boston Legal"" but most are not). Greengrass then combines their largely unknown faces with real people who were actually there on the day - Ben Sliney of Herndon Air-Traffic Control, Thomas Roberts of Boston ATC, Curt Applejack of New York ATC and Major John Fox heads up the military. Along with other staff members, the effect is like watching the events unfold in front of you - but in real-time.

The music by JOHN POWELL is also used sparingly - but when it's applied - it packs either an incredibly sinister punch or ups your pulse-rate big time.

Then there's the astonishing editing. The camera moves behind people's heads as they run down corridors - we get momentary glimpses of worried faces through gaps in clothing - there's close-ups on sweating foreheads which then in turn pull back onto disbelieving faces. There's side profiles of personnel constantly making and answering phonecalls - desperately trying to get a grip on the escalating panic. Speech quickens as the chaos escalates - and it all ratchets up the tension to the nines. So when the horror finally comes - it's devastating.

The first sign of trouble is American Airlines Flight 11, which stops responding to hails from Air-Traffic Control and then disappears off radar over New York (it's gone into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre). Then an officer examines a tape of what was transmitted from the cockpit - he works out that the word 'planes' is used and not 'plane' - as in plural. With 4000 aircraft in the sky - their terror is palpable. Then it gets really ugly. The second of the hijacked aircraft (United 175) finally appears on the New York skyline outside their observation tower. But instead of making an emergency landing - and as they watch - it flies at escalated speed and smashes directly into the South Tower - bursting into flames. Now both buildings are on fire. The moment of silent disbelief that follows in the Control Room is heart-stopping.

The script is fast and punchy too. Wisely Greengrass avoided conspiracy theories in his construction but did include factual details. The American military's Airforce NORAD was conducting a drill on that morning (of all mornings) and was informed by the FAA of the hijackings. At 08:46 a.m. they scrambled four F-15 fighter planes from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts to enter New York airspace, but politicians denied them 'engage' orders. Controversy has raged ever since. But again, Greengrass doesn't discuss this. He just shows the pandemonium at every level of authority while at the same time concentrating on what matters - the 'people' - and especially their eventual bravery - when they realized they weren't going to be any negotiations and they had to stop fanatics killing even more innocents.

Some words now on the bonus material - the 2006 UK single DVD had 3 'Extras' - ""United 93: The Families And The Film"" (60-minutes), a feature-length commentary by Paul Greengrass and ""Memorial Pages"" - passengers and crew remembered with 40 written biographies. However, an American 2 DVD set put out in 2007 provided more. Added on were - ""Flight 93 National Memorial"", ""Chasing Planes - Witnesses To 9/11"" and ""Twin Towers"". This BLU RAY has all 6 features. The ""Families"" documentary in particular is extraordinary - where the actors meet the families with often beautiful results. Those who've lost someone are permanently hurting people - and acknowledgement/discussion of this by anyone other than the authorities (who have to appear to care) is hugely cathartic. In between the interviews are a lot of family photos and home movies - so be prepared for sadness as well as celebration.

To sum up - given the ultra-sensitivity of the material - ""United 93"" is a fantastic film and a major achievement for all involved. It's also a worthy reissue in Universal's 100th Anniversary series on BLU RAY/DVD with well thought-out and fitting extras that both enhance and inform.

I just wish it hadn't taken so many lost lives to produce something of worth and beauty. May they rest in peace...

PS: as an aside - but related to 9/11...
I urge to check out a video on YouTube called ""Regret"" by THE BLUE NILE. Apparently collated and posted by a fan that wanted to say something about the atrocity on its 10th Anniversary - the video uses one of this superlative Scottish band's lesser-known tunes - ""Regret"". The song originally turned up as a UK non-album B-side to the 12"" single of the ""Tinseltown In The Rain"" from 1984 on Linn Records. It's only LP/CD appearance to my knowledge is a 1991 compilation called ""The Tree And The Bird And The Fish And The Bell - Glasgow Songs By Glasgow Artists"". It's hard to find but worth hunting down.

""Regret"" is played against a backdrop of black and white images from that tragic event. Recorded years before in a country some 6000 miles away (and of course about something entirely different) it somehow fits perfectly - both musically and lyrically. Words from it title this review.

More to the point (and I'll openly admit to this) - it moved me to tears.",1346544000,,9200,4.820025348542459
1548984,5,B00005JOZI,"Came just as expected and was a great price. The movie is chilling to watch, but well worth your time to help us all remember that fateful day in our countries history and the lives that were lost that day.",1342483200,,206,4.175
1548985,5,B00005JOZI,"I came across a 9/11 movie toward the end.  I did not know the title.  I thought ""United 93"" was it.  It wasn't.  But I'm glad I ordered it.  It was hard watching the passengers treating the day like just another day, just another flight; knowing the finale. But like another Amazon reviewer said, I felt better at the end of the film that those passengers fought fiercely for their lives.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloody-Sunday-VHS/dp/B00008DDHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloody Sunday [VHS</a>]

I'm working backwards through Director Paul Greengrass' body of work starting with ""United 93"" then ""The Bourne Supremacy.""  I never heard of ""Bloody Sunday"" the movie or the event, which happened when I was a young adult.

This event was horific.  However, I guess I was spoiled by Greengrass' later works.  The only tie is Greengrass' hand-handle technique.  The presentation was disjointed.  I did not connect with any of the people.  I can make this point, because Director Greengrass snippets of various passengers in ""United 93,"" that were powerful enough to make me care very much about them.  So, I think Director Greengrass evolved in this aspect of his up close technique.

As a matter of fact, I just ordered Greengrass ""United 93"" Working Script from Amazon to see exactly how Greengrass scripted the everyday actions of the passengers on the plane before terror struck as well as their individual reactions after the plane was taken over.",1336608000,,1496,5.329059829059829
1548986,5,B00005JOZI,"I lack words for describing correctly the effect this movie made on me. I was shocked beyond what I can describe and consider ""United 93"" as one of the best real events description moments in cinema history.

Paul Greengrass decided to make this film in a totally non-Hollywoodian style and he was dead right on target. No famous names, no Hollywood stars and some real air controllers who were in service on September 11 play themselves. The story keeps (as much as I can judge) strictly to the events of the day and there is no typically American alterations (no little girls waiting for transplantation, etc.). The events on board of United 93, the plane where passengers rebelled against the terrorists and stormed the cockpit, are described based on the real telephonic conversations, radio transmissions and the record from the black box. Some more conversations had to be added, but they fit very much to the rest of the story.

The terrorists are very well described, including their leader (the pilot) who actually hesitates about ten minutes before giving the order of attack - it seems he was the only one of the attackers who was married and was leaving somebody behind. Even this is deduced from the real events, because United 93 was indeed hijacked later after the take off, than the three other planes. The fight on board of the plane is extremely ugly and realistic - no Hollywood usual stuff again.

The incredible conversations between the military air defence command and the Supreme Headquarters of the US Air Force are one of the high points of the movie, with the general in charge begging desperately for a permission to shoot the hijacked planes before learning, that the two fighters that he managed to send in the air on such a short notice are unarmed... etc, etc. This is a great, great description of a great tragedy and possibly the best illustration of the proverbial ""fog of war"" I ever seen.

As one of the previous reviewers, me too I do not think I will ever see this movie again - not because it is bad, but because it is SOOOOO good. Be warned - this is a masterpiece, but it is heartbreaking and the tension is almost unsufferable...",1333324800,,2172,4.692913385826771

1549062,5,B00005JOZI,"When Paul Greengrass went into production on this film, many people said it was ""too soon.""  Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but the fact is that this film will shake you and it's time of release in relation to the actual events depicted may have even helped the film to make a larger impact on its audience, as the events were fresher than they are at this point.

The film is masterfully written and directed.  It is composed in a documentary style, which lends the film a realistic tone.  It feels like you are on the plane and in the middle of the action as the air traffic controllers witness these horrific events.  Another great help to the film's sense of reality is the lack of stars in it.  By not using recognizable, high-profile actors, Greengrass avoids taking you out of the movie as it unfolds.  There are no, ""Hey look, it's Bill Murray!"" moments in the film, and in this case it adds to the audience's ability to get drawn into the story.

The whole film is quite an emotional, stressing experience, but there are two shots that haunt my mind whenever I remember this film.  The first is a shot of the air traffic controllers being baffled about the whereabouts of one of the planes while through the windows in the background you can see that the plane is well within view.  It offers a unique perspective of the events and it is jaw-droppingly effective.  The second shot is the closing shot of the film.  It also offers a unique perspective that I honestly don't think I have seen in other films.  It is the perfect, completely unsettling way to end the film.

An amazing film that is worth viewing at least once. Even if the film is too much to take for any repeat viewings, it needs to be seen.  It is a film experience I will never forget, and I'm sure you won't either.",1322697600,2,1792,4.404255319148936
1549063,4,B00005JOZI,"Of the four passenger jets hijacked on 9/11, United Flight 93 is the only one that didn't reach its target. This was due to the heroism of its passengers who learned about the other hijackings and the hits to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon via phone calls to loved ones after their own plane was commandeered. When they realized that they were to be used as a bomb, they took matters into their own hands. The events depicted are drawn from numerous phone calls made to friends, families and associates during the hijacking.

As a former pilot, I personally prefer the footage that shows the confusion, the consternation, and ultimately the incredulity of the stunned people who manned the control towers, the flight service centers and the FAA, along with the U.S. military. Amid mounting chaos, those guys managed to land every commercial aircraft in United States airspace (approximately 4200) in just under three hours, an unprecedented action done with blinding speed and total safety. The hijacked planes had their transponders turned off so any plane still in the air would be an enemy.

From the extras on the DVD (from Amazon.com), I know the actors actually called upon the families of the victims they portrayed, saw their homes, met their families and heard their voices from phone messages left just before they died. The actors are remarkably authentic in their portrayals. In addition, a number of the air traffic control officials who were on duty that morning portray themselves in the film.

I had avoided seeing this when it was first released, but Seattle stage actor Cheyenne Jackson was cast as Mark Bingham, one of the heroic passengers, so naturally I wanted to see ""our guy"" on the silver screen.

1549064,5,B00005JOZI,I don't see this movie as a cash-in on a tragedy. I personally believe this was done in honor of passengers that became soldiers on that tragic day. It's not too soon to make a movie in their memory. Everyone who worked together to create the film did a superb job of acting and because there were no a-list actors we're not distracted from the story- the emotions were very real and it struck the very core of my being with a sick sadness. Few movies ever make me cry like that.,1316476800,,479,4.217391304347826

1549066,5,B00005JOZI,"From its opening frames to the final credits, UNITED 93 is the most terrifying film you can ever sit through. I know very few people who have taken time to watch it because 9-11 evokes such visceral memories. I lost a childhood friend on this day and so each year his memories surface and I find it a hard day to go through when I think about my friend and then the greater tragedy and how our country changed forever. That said, UNITED 93 is respectful of those who lost their lives on that dreaded day and it honors the brave men and women on this flight who truly were heroes by preventing the final attack from reaching its appointed target. Greengrass' direction is amazingly tight and never allows the film to become overly dramatic. He deftly cuts between the air traffic controllers responding to the initial crashes and the passengers and crew taking their places on United's flght, always capturing the extraordinary ordinariness of people simply making their way in the world and responding to an unfolding crisis without fanfare. However, it's the film's final passage when the terrorists take over Flight 93 that Greengrass' masterful work truly reveals itself as you are on that flight for good until it ends. I literally crawled up the back of my couch in terror and really wanted to just run from the room--and then it made me truly understand the depth of bravery of everyone on board that flight. They did not run, they faced the evil on board with steadfast resolve to not let a bunch of scum take down our nation any further. It's a testament to Greengrass for making a film that honors and celebrates the spirit of those 40 men and women, who truly personify a level of patriotism that very few may ever display in their lifetime. The film is simply brilliant on disc and technically flawless. And each actor--even those who played the evil men--is nothing short of fantastic. I don't know that I would revisit this film any time soon, but it did inspire me to become a major donor to the Flight 93 memorial. If you've never seen it, please make a point to check it out. It's certainly the definition of real horror, but it's a reverent film portraying the boldest and bravest of 40 American heroes we have known in a while.",1316044800,,2245,4.600997506234414

It feels real, heightened by the fact that many of those onscreen are playing themselves.  Actual footage of the day is used seamlessly.  If you aren't emotionally wrenched by the end, you're made of concrete.  It's that strong.

Technically, the film looks better than ever, and the sound mix is an absolute knockout.

The release of this movie on Blu-ray on September 6, 2011 - to coincide with the 10th anniversary of 9/11 - is such an incredible insult and offense it truly leaves me at a loss for words.

This vulgar profiteering is even more offensive since the movie - which is excellent - was deftly able to avoid causing offense when it was made and released.

Corporate America truly is bereft of any soul.

UPDATE - 3.6.12.

I find it interesting to see that so many people have so little sensitivity. No wonder we live in a country where a corporation now is considered a ""person"". Well, not in my world.

There are so many other days of the year this movie could have been released, so clearly this was a well-thought out marketing decision.

1549071,5,B00005JOZI,"I am intrigued by the series of events that transpired on September 11 - many in tandem with another and in a confusing, overwhelming combination. United 93 helps make sense of a coordinated plan that set its sights not only on the World Trade Center but also the Pentagon, perhaps the White House, and even the National Mall, according to reports on the day of the attacks. (The National Mall story was later proven false - there was not a fire there.) On one level, this movie looks at the air traffic control situation and responses to alleged or confirmed hijackings. This macro focus helps explain the interplay between different reports and commands on the part of the government. At one point you see a plane disappear from radar before it hits the World Trade Center - right before the eyes of the air traffic controllers. Drawing the link between the supposedly ""removed, impersonal"" government and the people on the ground helps to humanize the situation even further (think, the FDNY firefighters.)

Still, the government failed in its mission - and the variety of faulty reports and missed opportunities attests to that. The military did not deploy any anti-aircraft weapons against United 93, although the control rooms at various agencies were clearly buzzing with activity. I would best describe the response shown in the movie as ""sound and fury."" And that's exactly what is was. Thankfully, the movie lacks a socio-political agenda and portrays the events fairly. The deepest it delves into social commentary is to show the disorder and unpreparedness on the part of government, military, and aviation agencies such as the FAA and NORAD. Those are things that need to be shown - and viewers can make their own judgments.

If I had to say, I would call this a September 11 movie with a focus on United Airlines flight 93 - not the other way around. With the context of the national terrorist attack, the movie hones in on the crew, passengers, and terrorists aboard the plane. They are seen arriving at the airport and ordering meals, and later calling their families for the final time and organizing a plan of attack. They are shown to be very normal people. Thus, hearing their prayers and farewells helps you appreciate the very fact that you are alive and able to read this.

While touching and emotional, the movie is also tasteful. It sidesteps artistic exploitation. Indeed, the really dramatic sections of the hijacking and passenger response were confined to a few minutes in the middle of the movie and near the end. I give credit to the director for not extending or dramatizing these scenes any more than was necessary. Acts of violence arrive without any warning, helping to convey just how unexpected they really were. Everything is seen for what it is. The hijackers are shown reciting the Quran, the blood is bright red, and at the end, the grassy field in Pennsylvania draws closer and closer as the plane nosedives - and that's the end. It's an immersing experience.

I found this film moved very quickly and I was engrossed throughout. You get a real sense of the panic and confusion on that day and it goes some way to showing how difficult it must have been to deal with as it occurred. I was concerned this film would be pro American and biased, but it didn't seem to excessive in that respect and it gave the film all the more impact because of that. I found myself extremely choked up when the passengers on the flight were ringing relatives to say goodbye and couldn't even begin to imagine having to do something like that. The ending is full of drama and very powerful and although we have no way of truly knowing every event on that flight, this goes some way to portraying the fears and events that may have occurred.

This is not a Hollywood epic. There are no big-name stars to distract you from the story. There are no monologues or dramatizations to try to frame a message or tug at heart strings. No, this movie tries to tell as accurately as possible the tale of the passengers and crew of Flight 93, the airliner hijacked by the death-worshippers of Osama on September 11th, 2001. It tells the story not in long scenes or made-up dialog but by snatches of conversations amongst the passengers and by showing the story on the ground, at Air Traffic Control NYC and NORAD's local sector command center.

The people on that plane could have been any of us... they were just ordinary housewives, business men, retirees. They didn't ask or deserve to be placed in harm's way but it is the nature of terrorist to strike at those who have no reason to fear. Yet, when it became obvious that the terrorists had no intention of holding the passengers hostage or even of landing the aircraft the passengers fought back. They became heroes the same way many people become heroes... they overcome their fear to do what had to be done. They saved many lives that day, no one can guess how many.

1549204,5,B00005JOZI,"I had heard of ""United 93"" from enthusiastic viewers when it first came out.  I waited for it to come to our town but I kept waiting and waiting until I finally asked the theater owner what the delay was all about.  He said that they weren't going to show it because there hadn't been any demand for it.  I said that he ought to at least show it for a week and find out for sure but it never came.  I had heard that it was intense and realistic and, of course, most of us already knew what ""United 93"" was about just from the title.  I had also heard that it was rather low-budget; no ""names"" in the cast, the camera-work seemed hand-held, and a few other comments that are usually reserved for ""B movies"".  However, despite whatever disclaimers I heard, I also understood that the film had an impact on those who saw it.

I rented ""United 93"" the other night and I am still immersed it.  This movie is very professionally made and it grabs you right from the beginning.  There is a lot that we see unfolding before us that we already understand.  It is impressive how the air traffic controllers are intitially curious then mystified then appalled.  The film-makers could have just assumed the audience knew all the background (which we still do) and focus on the lives of the victims leading up to climax of the taking and retaking of the plane.  In other words, they could have made the typical Hollywood disaster film.  By retracing the events of 9/11 sequencially we relived the event and found a conclusion to the one aspect that remained a mystery.

I do not know how much the film relied on second-hand witness accounts (the film reminds us of the many calls to loved ones from the passengers on board).  I don't recall if the black box was recovered in tact.  However, I was satisfied with the reaction of the paasengers and their conclusion of hijacking.  These were not people portrayed as heroic.  Rather, they were portrayed like ourselves as people independently traveling for reasons of their own.  The development of a group focus was excellently done and the ultimate sacrifice that they made for ourselves and themselves was the chaotic effort of amateurs with a cause.

For many of us, 9/11 was a mixture of anger, sorrow, fear and insecurity.  Yet there was courage and pride in that mix as well.  From the NY Police Departments to the NY Fire Departments to the passengers of United 93 we had a lot to be proud of.  Nothing I've seen brings that out as much as the movie ""United 93"".",1265673600,2,2504,4.491150442477876
1549205,4,B00005JOZI,"United Airways Flight 93 was a civil aircraft making a regular passenger run from Newark Airport, New York City, to San Francisco on the morning of 11 September 2001. Members of the terrorist organisation al-Qaeda seized control of four aircraft that morning, including United 93. The other three aircraft were crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, DC. The hijackers of United 93 were planning to crash their aircraft into the Capitol Building in Washington, but the plane was delayed for half an hour due to an overbooked departure window. By the time the aircraft was drawing close to Washington, news of the attacks on New York and Washington had reached the passengers on United 93. Realising that their aircraft was also going to be used as a weapon, the passengers and crew resolved to storm the cockpit and retake control of the aircraft.

United 93 is one of several films based on the events of 9/11, but is the one that is based most closely on the real events of that day. The script was assembled with close attention paid to the findings of the 9/11 Commission and countless interviews with people involved in the events of the day in air traffic control centres, airport towers and in the military. In fact, during the pre-production phase director Paul Greengrass made the decision to employ a large number of these consultants in the film as actors, playing themselves. The most prominent is Ben Sliney, National Operations Manager at the Federal Aviation Administration centre in Virginia. Sliney is credited as the person who gave the unprecedented order to ground every aircraft in American airspace - over four thousand of them - in the aftermath of the attacks. The American military gave their full cooperation to the film, allowing active personnel to portray themselves. The military were caught off-guard by 9/11, which exposed significant weaknesses in the American air defence system (namely that the hijacking of aircraft was not considered a realistic threat and that only four fighter jets were available for the defence of the entire Eastern Seaboard), but they allowed these problems to be shown in the film to convey the sheer unprecedented nature of the attacks.

As part of the quest for authenticity, all forty-four of the actors portraying the hijackers, passengers and crew were picked to match the real passengers as closely as possible. Many of them spent time with the families of the passengers they were portraying in an attempt to get as close as possible to their subjects. The result is a documentary-like feel to the events of the film, in stark contrast to the rather mawkish over-dramatic feel of the several other TV movies and 'docu-dramas' based on the events of the day. Performances are universally flawless, and the fact that so many of the performers in the military command post and the air traffic control centres are not professional actors is a real surprise.

Structurally, the film condenses some events at the beginning of the movie in order to fit the whole story in the running time. However, from the moment Flight 93 takes off, the movie switches to real-time. Greengrass is a superb director, as seen in his previous movies, and here paces events to perfection with the growing chaos of the situation and the increasingly futile attempts by the authorities to stay on top of it vividly depicted. The moment Sliney takes charge and shuts down American airspace is notable as it's the point at which control over the situation is, to some extent at least, regained. This is also significant as Greengrass cuts away from events on the ground at that point and the rest of the movie unfolds entirely within the aircraft.

Obviously, vast numbers of people watching this film will have vivid memories of 9/11 themselves, and each viewer will watch the film partially through the lens of their own experiences and feelings from that day. For this reason, Greengrass tries not to offer any kind of political or ideological commentary on events, as this would invariably skew the film and lose some of its impact. Events unfold starkly and with no attempt to interpret them. On the commentary Greengrass points out that the hijackers were devout Muslims and shows them praying before and during the hijacking, and reveals he wanted to convey a thematic idea that the terrorists were hijacking the religion to excuse their actions as well as literally hijacking the aircraft, but this idea can't come across very well in the film due to the stripping back of any kind of artistic elements in favour of the simple depiction of events. Similarly, the extraordinarily long delays in the military getting authorisation to shoot down hijacked aircraft and the collapse of many of the emergency procedures in place amongst the air controllers also passes without any kind of comment in the film. These things happened. Why they happened was up to the various post-9/11 committees and investigations to discover, and these events were outside the scope of the film, although references to the extreme length of time since the last hijacking over US airspace do convey somewhat that there were relatively few procedures in place to deal with the crisis, and none at all for the use of aircraft as suicide weapons.

Given the film's excellent direction and acting, not to mention its powerful impact and intensity, I strongly considered giving it the 'classic' appreciation. However, I chose not to due to several problems that would be considered minor in other films, but in one based so closely on real events could not pass unnoticed. The most notable is the extremely questionable decision to depict German passenger Christian Adams as an 'appeaser' who urgently counsels against the decision to storm the cockpit and at one point freaks out when all of the other passengers are shown as resolute or upset, but not actually having a breakdown. Given that there is no evidence that the real Adams did any of these things, Greengrass' decision to depict him as doing them is rather unfair and possibly damaging (a somewhat similar dubious decision to the depiction of William Murdoch, the first officer of the Titanic shown gunning down panicking passengers in the Cameron movie when in fact he did no such thing). The other problem is one outside of the film producers' control. At the time of shooting the cockpit voice recordings from the plane had not been publicly released, and there were no signs they were going to be. The recordings actually were released before the movie came out, revealing that several key events in the film are erroneous (the most notable being that the passengers failed to gain access to the cockpit at all). Both of these problems would be to some extent excusable in a full work of fiction, but given the movie's extreme fidelity to the truth elsewhere, they introduce elements of doubt and misdirection to the narrative which are regrettable.

Despite these issues, United 93 (****) is a powerful and affecting film. It is not easy viewing but it is certainly worth watching to get a good sense of the chaos and confusion of that day as people struggled to react to the unthinkable. The movie is available now on DVD (UK, USA).",1263859200,3,7277,4.917005695687551

1549208,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 presents in chronological order the horrific sequence of events that occurred on 9-11-01, which resulted in the World Trade Center Twin Towers collapse, the Pentagon strike, and the crash of United 93 in a farmfield in Pennsylvania.

(United 93 is the airplane that was hijacked by terrorists with the purpose of crashing it into the Capitol building (or the White House)).

The movie is very well done, presented in a factual manner with little Hollywood hyperbole.  It takes the viewer from the hotel rooms of the terrorists (praying to Allah for success), to the air-traffic controllers who tried to make sense out of the events as they occurred in real time, to the boarding of the passengers of United 93, the hijacking, and the heroic, yet failed attempt to regain control of the plane by a group of United passengers.  One can viscerallty sense the profound confusion and indecision of the air-traffic controllers and the passengers that fateful day. What was going on? How to respond to it? The communications between the air-traffic controllers, the military, and the President is shown to be confused and incomplete.  Can United 93 be shot down by militry jets to prevent another major catastrophe? Our unpreparedness for this type of attack is clearly evident.

While air-traffic controllers struggle to determine what to do, we also view the evolving condition on the airplane.  Step by step, as more information is obtained by passengers on furtive cell-phone calls to family members, they come to the stark realization that their plane is doomed, and that they must do something to prevent another disasterous crash.

As the plane speeds headlong into its final moments, with the passengers fighting for control of the cockpit, we see the ground rapidly looming up in the windows of the plane, exactly as the passengers must have seen. It is gripping and horrible.  It feels like we are in the plane with the passengers: the fighting, the confusion, the screams, the plane lurching to and fro, the abject terror of the moment.  Then all goes dark.

This production seems more like a documentary than a movie production.  For instance, the names of the 37 passengers are not given, nor is there any significant character development.  The viewer gets the sense that these 37 random people boarded the plane, knowing nothing about each other, and were forced to quickly 'unite"", communicate, and then react to the developing situation.  Despite the sparce characterizations, there is still considerable emotional impact, as the humanity of the passengers and crew is shown as they make calls to their loved ones to say a final ""goodbye"".

There is historical debate whether the passengers actually entered into the cockpit.  However, there is no doubt that their actions in trying to retake the plane resulted in the crash, and saved Washington from a direct hit on a symbol of American government (the Capitol building).[...]

We are nearly 8 years removed from 9-11-01, when Bin Laden boldly proclaimed war on the USA.  Although we are fortunate to not have suffered another homeland terrorist attack, Bin Laden is still at large, and no doubt has plans to strike us again.  Watching this movie reminds me that the war of terror continues, and we must be continually vigilant lest we forget the past.

The passengers are inspected for hidden weapons, none are found. The passengers board the flight to San Francisco. An air traffic controller notices a problem with Flight 11 out of Boston. [Delays cost $2,000 a minute.] The radar suddenly loses track of Flight 11 when it is near Manhattan. The see smoke coming out of the North Tower (about 8:45 AM). ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" United 175 dropped its transponder. Where is it? It crashes into the South Tower~ Flights are halted in Boston, New York, and Washington. Langley is warned about Flight 11 nearing Washington. When will they engage? The President has to make the call.

On board Flight 93 one of the terrorists makes a bomb in the rest room. They start stabbing the passengers and enter the cockpit to remove the pilots. Air Traffic Controller hear the disturbance and note the change in direction. They have to get the plane before it gets withing 50 or 60 miles from Washington! ""Our time has come"" says the terrorist who is flying the plane. ""Where are those fighter jets?"" The flight attendants try to calm the passengers. ""The Vice-President can make the call."" The news tells of the attack on the Pentagon. All planes are ordered to land, foreign flights are turned back. Some of the passengers decide to fight back since they have nothing to lose. Where can they get weapons? Others make calls on the air phones. Can they come up with a plan?

The passengers attack the hijackers, one goes down. They push a cart against the other terrorist and he goes down. Next the cart is used as a battering ram against the cockpit door so they can attack the last two terrorists. No one can control the airplane so the flight makes an unscheduled landing. It was the only aircraft that failed to reach its target; this saved the Capitol or the White House from attack and destruction. By the time the President authorized shooting down hijacked aircraft it was all over. US airspace was closed, no civilian airliner was in the skies.

This film explains why there should be a memorial to the heroic passengers on Flight 93 - in Washington DC. The credits name the real people and the actors who portrayed them. Some actors were the real people who were involved. Could this hijacking have occurred in earlier times when the pilot was required to be armed and many passengers would also be armed? Should the US government have been more diligent? I wonder how they were able to reconstruct the events in the plane when no one survived?

There was sort of an eerie feel to watching it, knowing what the end would be and knowing that it was a true account.  The movie really drew you in.  I found my heart just breaking for the people aboard that plane and cannot imagine the emotions they must have felt for such a long period of time.  Their courage was nothing short of remarkable.

A couple of things I didn't like about the movie however, one was many of the scenes in the airport tower I couldn't hear, they had the background noise of people talking too loud and it was very difficult to decipher background noise from the main person talking.

Also, I didn't care for the ending, yes it was dramatic, but there was a sense of ""is this movie really over now?""  Not sure what I expected from the ending, but it just didn't feel done.

The events are well known to all.  On the day when four airliners were hijacked by radical Islamic terrorists, those on this craft fought back.  After the killers took over the airplane, several of those on board spoke with their loved ones by phone.  They found out about the other airliners that were flown into the World Trade Center and decided to go down fighting.  This is their story.

The creators of this movie did a great job of recreating the events of that day.  It is very well done and very powerful.  Every American should watch this and honor their memories.",1233014400,3,719,4.5984251968503935

United 93 manages to work as an incredibly skillfull thriller, building a great deal of tension up to a climax, and as a testament to those who lost their lives on 9/11; either way you slice it it's quite a film.",1231372800,3,230,4.2272727272727275
1549273,5,B00005JOZI,"Writer / director Paul Greengrass presents a plausible imagining of events aboard the ill-fated United Flight 93, which went down in a grassy field after the passengers stormed the cockpit rather than allow the hijackers to pursue their objective unchallenged.  This story is interwoven with the events in various control rooms as air traffic controllers and military personnel gradually realize what is happening and find to their horror that they are unprepared to stop it.

This film keeps a tight focus on the events of the day, thereby honoring the memories of the fallen by keeping our attention on their plight and their reaction to it, rather than making political points about the big picture.  There is no mention of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Afghanistan, or Iraq.  The audience becomes observers at the various locations and learns nothing that the actual participants would not have known.  We learn nothing more of the passengers on United 93 than we would if we were fellow travelers on the same flight.  The result is far more powerful than if the filmmakers had strained for effect through trumped up sentimental backstories or political proselytizing.  We are presented with a day of horror and confusion and the nobility of average people struggling to confront it with courage and dignity.",1228435200,4,1309,5.06046511627907

1549275,5,B00005JOZI,"This is a respectful, well-acted, honest, and as scrupulously accurate a cinematic account of the tragic flight of United 93 as we are probably ever going to see. For the few of you who don't know (and for you ""Truthers"" who disrespectfully call people ""sheeple""), United 93 was the fourth plane hijacked on September 11, 2001. The plane was turned toward Washington DC by the terrorists, but it never got there, instead crashing into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. As far as we can tell, the passengers attempted to seize the plane from the hijackers, who drove it a full speed straight into the earth. No one survived.

Some of what we see onscreen is necessarily supposition, based on ambient sounds in cellphone and airphone calls made by the passengers. We'll never know if the passengers succeeded in taking the plane even for a moment, but I like to think so.

People have said that this film is exploitative. They are, of course, welcome to their opinions, but there is nothing exploitative about UNITED 93, any more than there was anything exploitative about APOLLO 13. Film has become a medium for reporting history, hopefully responsibly.

""9/11 Truthers,"" in love with conspiracy theories, advance the idea that the government planned the entire incident, but their ""facts"" are made of inference upon inference, skewed to acheive a particular result. Bushworld did not need 9/11 to advance it's Preemptive War Doctrine; any of a score of minor incidents would have sufficed. Hitler started World War II over a border incident at Gleiwitz, a phony incident in which German soldiers battled other German soldiers masquerading as Polish soldiers. A few phony mannequin soldiers were even ""killed.""

But there was certainly nothing phony about the deaths on 9/11.

The media and the establishment have made ""heroes"" out of the Flight 93 passengers, but this both embellishes and obscures the truth. Americans tend to like their ""heroes"" larger than life, infallible, brave beyond reckoning, and unblemished, the types of mythic figures of which we make statues.

Yet we forget that the true heroes are everyday people, like fathers and mothers who go to work each day, return home each night, and dedicate their lives to the kids and to little things like painting the garage, and people who keep on with an exhausting and impossible task to the end no matter the result.

The Flight 93 passengers are these kinds of heroes, heroes without quotation marks.

After hearing the news that the World Trade Center and The Pentagon had been attacked, realizing that they themselves were doomed if they did nothing, and faced with the reality that they most likely would die anyway, they fought back against the zeal-infected hijackers with airline cutlery, hot water, and sheer determination. Flight 93 became a manned cruise missile, a kamikaze mission, and a battleground on which a group of ordinary, terrified people transcended fear in order to take back what had been taken from them, their lives. That they died in no way diminishes what they accomplished.

This film is a fitting memorial to them.",1221696000,5,3116,5.023255813953488
1549276,5,B00005JOZI,"I saw this late last night and have to say, I watched it knowing I wouldn't be able to sleep afterwards and wanting to stop watching. Hard to do though, such is the grip the director exerts.

Of course, the story itself is so deeply compelling that even if it had been badly made it would have been dificult to switch off.  The sense of ""this could just as easily have happened to me"" is overwhelming.

We all have memories of that day, and one of mine is of a little snippet of the confusion: at one point the media was announcing that a bomb/plane had hit the State Department, a story that disappeared without trace within hours. That confusion, when it is not clear what is true and what is not, is well-captured here - particularly among the air-traffic controllers.

After the second plane hit no one knew whether there was just one more to come or fifty. Of the thousands of planes flying over the US, any number could have been potential missiles. And clearly, no one had ever envisaged the possibility of something like this happening, so for a moment all the experts and professionals were lost in a ""what do we do now"" helplessness.

The sheer courage of the passengers in rebelling should never be underestimated.  It would have been remarkable even if there had been previous, similar hijackings, and from the beginning it had been obvious what was going on. In the heat of that terrible moment, in which almost everyone else was dumbfounded or paralysed, it was truly extraordinary.",1221436800,4,1496,4.626415094339623
1549277,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 is one of the most harrowing movie experiences you're likely to have. This is because, of course, it is based on a real event and the viewer will know the outcome - everyone on the plane dies.  As such, there is no way to know how many of the events depicted on the screen are factual - did the passengers overcome 2 of the hijackers and force their way into the cockpit?  Was the plane headed for the Capitol? (personally, I think it more likely it was headed to the Pentagon, just as 2 planes headed to the WTC)  Was the leader really having second thoughts?  If not, why did the hijackers take so long to make their moves, especially since they were already delayed 30 minutes before takeoff?

As the writer and the director, Paul Greengrass speculates on the answers to these questions and presents a logical sequence of events, interspersed with factually verifiable events such as the timing of the WTC hits and the air traffic controllers' conversations.  These scenes recreate the confusion of 9/11 extremely effectively because, as Greengrass points out in the Director's commentary (multiple times), the use of airliners as cruise missiles was simply an inconceivable event.

Most difficult to watch, however, are the phone calls home from the passengers on the plane as they call to say good-bye.  Presumably these are the actual words spoken by the passengers, and that verity is extremely personal and difficult to watch.

So, if the film is not factual, and does not even claim to be factual, what does it have going for it?  Basically, it feels True.  It never dramatizes the events, and often the dialogue feels ""overheard"" (even the famous ""Let's roll"").  The passengers are scared, but in their fear they realise (perhaps the first in the country) what's going on and choose to act.  We never learn anything about them - another correct step by Greengrass, whose goal appears to be putting the film viewer on the plane with the passengers.  They are strangers to us, they are strangers to each other, but they are all in it together and trust each.  Greengrass has been criticized for humanizing the hijackers.  But, of course, the hijackers WERE humans, and to portray them as monsters or psychopaths would deny human nature.

Obviously many (most?) will find the film impossible to watch.  For those that can (and you know who you are), you will find newfound respect for the courage of the common man, and newfound sympathy for the people involved - not only those that perished, but those air traffic controllers and others that tried their best in an impossible situation to regain control of a situation they could not have conceieved of that morning when they went to work.",1220918400,7,2708,4.787096774193548

People that were even at historic events will say ""it was like a movie"". How can you ever know what it would be like to be on a plane that you and everyone on board knows is going to crash? You can't. It transcends waking consciousness. It still can be imagined, however. It can be portrayed in such a way as to give you the viewer *some* idea -I really believe this after seeing UNITED 93. And it is scary as hell. If you allow yourself to be absorbed by this film I feel you'll come as close as a movie can take you in having some sense -just some- of the sheer terror. You are going to die. It's over. It is over. Your life is gone. You begin to realize this. At first there is denial of coarse but one way or another reality sets in for you. You will never see your family again. You will never eat again, hug your child again, go to the park again, go to the movies again, make love again, nothing. Your going to die in the worst way. You are about to be broken, ripped apart, burned. What awaits you? Are you even able to think or you just overcome? The horror. The flood of emotion, of thoughts, images, your life flashing before you. People freaking out around you. Murderous little foreign relgious nuts, creeps with box cutters stabbing people. What are you going to do? What do you do? What can you do? You'll never really know unless your in that situation. Some people on that plane decided not to just sit there and wait to die. That's not too bad a way to go out. UNITED 93 is a fine film and does justice to this historic moment in American history. Credit is to be given to director Paul Greengrass [THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, and the upcoming GREEN ZONE(!)] for his talents in depicting real-life events in such an outstanding way.

Watch it alone or with someone who can sit through a movie without running their mouth. Turn the lights off, turn the cell phone off, shut up, and sit there straight through, no interruptions.

I've never seen a film that makes you so proud to be a human being, then so fully crushes your spirit until you're in tears.  The last 10 minutes or so are very hard to watch, and I had a lump in my throat when the final scene faded to black.

1549281,5,B00005JOZI,"I can't help but feel ashamed that for quite a while, I wouldn't see this movie. Not because it's horrific, mind you, but because of the fact that I once foolishly assumed that this was exploitative film-making, that not only would it fail to honor the heroes in United 93, but also that it would cheapen the significance of one out of four awful incidents of that tragic day. I absolutely loved the way ""25th Hour"" from Spike Lee handled the 9/11 subject matter: as a background and parallel to the characters' lives. I couldn't imagine watching something that directly dealt with it. I can't say how deeply upset ""United 93"" made me, and yet how proud I am that someone sitting next to me on the subway potentially could have that kind of courage to deal with unimaginable circumstances, I certainly am unsure as to how I would handle something like that. Despite that I knew what the outcome would be, I never stopped rooting for the terrific ensemble cast, and even within the last few minutes, the film provoked a feeling that somehow and some way, the passengers would survive. I remember that when it happened, I was in a college dorm watching the WTC footage live on the television. As gut-wrenching as I felt back then, the scenes that took place at the various control centers made me realize how lucky I was to have the comfort of friends around me as opposed to having to directly deal with the situation. The light small talk that the passengers were having before and after lift-off is very human and very scary: that something very ordinary as talking about your grandchildren with someone sitting next to you could happen within the same few minutes that a hijack would occur. On a side note, I'm still very wary of watching ""World Trade Center"" from Oliver Stone, as I find that his style is ""more is more"", and that he has all the moving parts of a Hollywood Blockbuster that overall lacks humanity. However, I was wrong about this exceptional film, and so it's possible that I may be jumping the gun again.

1549316,1,B00005JOZI,"Like the 9/11 Report upon which it's based, it's laughably easy to expose this travesty for what it is, i.e., another media collusion with the murderous gangsters who run the United States government and who perpetrated 9/11.

Next time you take a commercial flight, bring your cell phone and watch the reception bars drop to zero soon after  takeoff; after about 8,000 feet you never get even one bar. (I've done this 14 times and counting.) What does this mean? It means that the cell phone calls supposedly made from Flight 93 were faked. It means that our government -- in what's known as a 'false flag operation' -- perpetrated the 'attacks'. (Their motive should be obvious to all but the mindless.)

Before you pipe up with the usual ""Nutcase conspiracy theory!!!!"" just do it. Try to get even one bar from above 8,000 feet. Then go to the 9/11 Commission Report and read that the cell phone calls were made from between 35,000 feet and 40,000 feet.

Impossible.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever is left, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.."" Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

The two disc 'Special Edition' includes a documentary called Chasing Planes, produced by Michael Bronner (a producer of United 93) in which the government/filmmakers try to persuade us that 93 was not shot down, mostly through interviews with NORAD officers Marr and Arnold. Problem is, everything they say is completely contradicted by onscreen TV interviews they did immediately after 9/11. I'll paraphrase both of them: ""We had jets shadowing Flight 93 and were prepared to shoot it down"", and ""We were prepared to take lives in the air to save lives on the ground."" Now both they and the 9/11 Commission claim the nearest fighter jet were 100 miles away and that the FAA didn't tell the military (NORAD) about 93 until well after it crashed. A bald-faced, incredible lie, as the Norad time line of September 18, 2001 had been saying for three years before the 9/11 Commission's fantasy was published to save the military/the Bush administration from charges of treason and mass murder.

There were no Hollywood type invented side stories or personal dramas added to the story line. The movie, United 93 didn't just take place on the airplane, but much of it also took place in various control towers, which was quite interesting.

1549318,5,B00005JOZI,"Paul Greengrass had a hefty undertaking here.  Not even five years had passed since the tragic events of 9/11 took place before Greengrass started filming his tribute to the brave souls aboard United 93.  The horrific events were not only still fresh in the minds of the American public but the subject was sore indeed.  Greengrass was either going to succeed in bringing the American public together in their praise and admiration of his film or he was going to send them running from the theaters in aggravation and frustration and thus risked becoming the director labeled as the one who failed to do justice to such a grave subject.

I think we can all agree that Greengrass succeeded marvelously here.

`United 93' is a beautifully honest rendering of the tragic day known as 9/11.  Taking an honest look into not only the lives of the `victims' aboard the plane but also the hijackers and the befuddled men and women on the ground, `United 93' is able to reach into the pit of its audiences soul and extract a real connection to the events taking place on the screen.

The film opens with a calm and eerie depiction of the four men responsible for this tragedy preparing themselves for their `mission'.  It's the perfect way to open the film for it automatically lets us know who these men our.  What I appreciate about what Greengrass does here is that, instead of shooting for the obvious and making this film all about how `evil' and `sadistic' these hijackers were he goes for the more intellectual route by showing us how `human' they were.  They honestly thought they were doing gods will.  It doesn't excuse their horrific actions, and of course neither does this film, but Greengrass successfully creates human `villains' for us.

As effective as the opening is, it's the ending that will really stay with you.  As much as we know how this story ends we find ourselves anticipating the passengers to `save the day' so-to-speak and so when the film abruptly ends we are left heartbroken all over again, as if we are hearing about these events for the first time.

Another aspect of `United 93' that is so masterful is the way Greengrass is able to depict the sudden and effortless decline into confusion and frustration, especially when concerning the men and women still on the ground.  As we are led through the events unfolding before the air traffic controllers we are instantly placed in their shoes and this overwhelming feeling of panic and desperation is etched across our bodies.  We feel tense; we feel scared; we feel alone.  By capturing this feeling Greengrass is able to keep the intensity high throughout the entire film, never losing the mood of the film.

The performances by the cast of unknowns are fantastic; utterly flawless.  By casting real life airline employees he was able to capture a true human nature to the reactions of the crew as well as the passengers.  Also, but casting no-name actors he was able to capture the raw realism of the events.  There are no recognizable faces here so there is no way we can be taken out of the film so-to-speak.  This way we are always thinking about the people being portrayed and not the actor doing the portraying.

I think when speaking of the acting one must point out the brilliance of the four actors portraying the hijackers.  Khalid Abdalla, Lewis Alsamari, Omar Berdouni and Jamie Harding all attacked these roles with fearlessness and confidence.  It was a brave thing, taking on the roles of men who are so loathed, feared and detested in America, but the manage to make these men real and human and thus utterly blew me away.  Ben Sliney has also received a lot of attention and praise for his performance (he played himself).  I must also mention him and his masterful performance; truly grounded and natural.

In the end though, this film belongs to Paul Greengrass.  His direction of this film is flawless (that Oscar should have been his).  His tribute is so honorable.  That word seems appropriate for this film; honorable.  It handles the events, not with sugarcoated delicacy but with emotional resonance and realistic humanity.  The film is gritty and raw and abrasive but in a way that captures the heart of the people involved.

`United 93' is one of the most controversial films around, and truly one of the most difficult to sit through; but it is a masterpiece of modern film making and is a film that everyone should experience at least once.",1207872000,7,4446,4.738621586475943
1549319,3,B00005JOZI,"Unless you live in a cave in Tibet, you know this film is about 9/11, and it's the second film I've seen on this. I saw World Trade Center earlier this year and felt it was so so (Maybe if they left out celebrity casting like this gem does, it would've been better). Donna and I had recorded Flight 93 on television, and I actually still don't know what the difference is between that and United 93. I do know that this one hit closest to home for me, literally. United 93 crashed in Somerset County less than 2 hours from my hometown. And we can postulate that it was a darn good thing it crashed since it was supposedly headed for D.C. Now I am not going to conspiracy theorize of anything with you, but how do we really know? Greenglass does a fine job of making a tasteful movie, but the only thing we know for sure that happened on that plane was what passengers said to people who they called before they all blew up and died. And Greenglass made his film around that.

I'll admit. I cried. I sit here writing this, looking at the small TV where I watched the second plane crash into the WTC on CNN, and I watched my daughter play around me as I watched the movie earlier. She will never know a world without 9/11. She will never know the taken for granted freedoms we once had. It bugged me that Greenglass almost seemed to attempt to get into the psyche of the terrorists in the film, as if he knew what they were thinking. And how white everyone but the terrorists were in the film. The film bugged me. It bugged me that as with my grandparents before me who know where they were when Pearl Harbor was bombed or my parents who know where they were when Kennedy was shot, and now I won't forget where I was in Sept 11, 2001. I was in my bedroom in our first apartment getting ready for work watching on a small Emerson CRT television. And I sit here writing this, I wonder where my daughter will be when the next big catastrophe happens.

Greenglass has a snowballs chance in hell for the directing nod, but maybe if the Academy wants to throw the auteur a bone it'll come in the shape of a film editing Oscar, even though there are some heavy hitters there, as well.

1549322,5,B00005JOZI,"On September 11th, 2001, our nation was changed forever. Terrorists from overseas came to our land and dealt us with a devastating blow, attacking the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As the terrorists thought we were down for the count, we did what we've done so many times before, we came back stronger and paid them back in full, and are continuing to do so through the war on terror. In 2006, two films were released that chronicled certain events from that day, one was Oliver Stone's (""Any Given Sunday"" and ""Alexander"") heartfelt tribute to the rescue efforts at Ground Zero in ""World Trade Center"", and the other was the documentary-style ""United 93"" from director Paul Greengrass (""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum""). The latter of which is the film that I will be discussing here.

""United 93"" tells the powerful story of the passengers aboard the last hijacked flight who thwarted the terrorists from delivering another deadly blow to our country. As 3 hijacked planes had hit their intended targets, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the fourth plane landed in a field, unsuccessfully finding its target. On that tragic morning it seemed as if nothing could stop the terrorist plot, but as the passengers aboard flight 93, via cell phone conversations with loved ones, were quickly learning of what had been transpiring on the ground, they knew they had to do something. Because the only way their flight wasn't going to be turned into another deadly weapon was for them to rise up as one, and fight back!

Many people felt that even after 5 years, it was still too soon to chronicle the events of that tragic day on film. Some even thought that the events should never be put to film, because for some the wound would never heal. For those people I have nothing but sympathy for them, and I completely understand why they would not want to see this film, or ""World Trade Center"". However, for the rest of us, I believe that this film and it's counterpart serve as chilling reminders of that day, of what evil actually lurks around in our world, but also of the incredible courage and indomitable will of the American spirit.

With ""United 93"", acclaimed director Paul Greengrass, serving as both writer and director for the film, has crafted a very moving, incredibly realistic account of what may have transpired aboard that flight. Many of the scenes were based on cell phone conversations between the passengers and their relatives, what was heard on the cockpit recordings, and the rest was based on family members descriptions of what their loved ones were like throughout their lives. Compiling all of these elements together, Greengrass has made ""United 93"" into a film that honors those brave souls that sat down as strangers and stood up as one.

Assisting Greengrass in honoring those victims of 9/11, was a cast of extremely talented, yet unknown actors and actresses that were given the unenviable task of playing these people in this highly emotional time, and not disrespecting their memory or their surviving families. Even though the actors/actresses were not a who's-who of Hollywood, they all handled each of their parts just as good as any A-lister, delivering such heartfelt emotion and depth in every performance. A truly magnificent job on all of their parts, I honestly believe that they did an exemplary job of honoring the memory of the people they were portraying.

I know that many of the families of the victims of that day may never see this movie, but should they ever see it, I believe that they will be honored by the performances of the actors, and the very realistic and moving film that Paul Greengrass has assembled. For those of you out there that feel you don't need to see this movie to remember that day, I understand you viewpoint, but I truly believe you should one day choose to watch this film so that you can remember that even in our darkest hour, there are those who will choose to be heroes.

""United 93"" is rated R for violence and language.",1196467200,2,4048,4.775714285714286
1549323,5,B00005JOZI,"This film uses documentary-like imagery to build deep, gripping suspense up to and through the heroic struggle of the unarmed passengers and crew against four armed murderers who take control of their plane.  It inspires us by showing the short time the passengers had available to decide to act, and the unforgettable bravery they demonstrated.  As one family member of a passenger urged, this film should be seen around the world.  I'd add that every American should visit Shanksville, PA and pay respects to these heroes.

For a detailed description of the real events on the flight, google the Newsweek article called ""The Real Story of Flight 93"".",1194998400,3,652,5.0092592592592595
1549324,4,B00005JOZI,"Watching Paul Greengrass' ""UNITED 93"" is an exercise in anxiety. We all know that the ending is not going to be pretty, and that, as much as our dream would have been for the passenger heroics to have stopped the hijackers and saved the plane; instead there is a big section of torn up field in Western Pennsylvania where the plane ultimately stopped.

The question is, then, is the film created with respect and dignity, or is it just another big budget lump? The answer splits at about 90% in favor of good.

By using unknown actors and people who actually were real-life participants as Sept 11 unfolded, Greengrass avoids the ticky-tacky sentiment and - in a gutwrenching way - forces these men and women to relive that horrible morning all over again. The actors cast were not picked for their dramatic skills as much as their everyday looks and behavior. They spend much of their early screen time making idle chat or calling work on their cell phones, unaware of their impending fates. The timeline cuts back and forth between the Air Traffic and FAA teams, the military and the plane itself.

The story is told in real time, filmed on handheld cameras that force a lack of opinion into ""United 93"" (as opposed to the made for TV&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-93-The-Movie/dp/B000EYJHDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight 93: The Movie</a>). Greengrass captures the confusion and panic, especially the utter horror of the Newark Airport employees as they see the second plane hit the towers. In that regard, ""United 93"" is unlike just about anything you'll ever see.

That remaining 10%, you ask? ""Untied 93"" can't help but indulge in populist myth-making. Greengrass made a valiant effort to get the approval of the passenger/crews family members before embarking on this movie's production. In the bonus documentary, some of the actors meet the families of the deceased, sometimes being more emotional than I'd wager the actors were prepared for. But my guess is, because of that need for confirmation and approval from these folks, almost every person on the flight plays an active role in taking on the terrorists. (With the exception of the one semi-foreign sounding man...which I found pointless.) But we don't know what happened. We can't know what was said. Did one of the passengers really say ""I'll break his wrists""? Did the hostesses really join the charge? Or was this just Greengrass' empathy getting the better of him? And despite the fact that those herky-jerky hand-carried camera shots added to the tension and claustrophobia of the scenes inside the plane, there were moments when my inner-critic started grousing ""buy this man a dman steadi-cam, already.""

That said, ""United 93"" is an affecting piece of film-making. It offers proof that not every major-studio offering gives into the lowest common denominator, and offers us, as citizen viewers, an opportunity to better comprehend the events that will forever mark our generation.

1549325,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93, directed by Paul Greengrass, is a film of technical and tonal brilliance. The way United 93 is filmed, by using a handheld camera, and recorded in real time, lets us experience the unprecedented chaos and horror on the morning of September 11, 2001.

Part of Greengrass's brilliance is that he avoids sentimentality. Rather, the film highlights the defiance of the passengers aboard United 93, by using the facts, as far as we know them, to launch into an admirable last-ditch attack on the hijackers.

This film did fill me with grief and despair, but leaves one feeling why stories matter so much to us. Watching and thinking about United 93, and listening to the families of those that were passengers aboard the flight, shown in the Special Features section of the DVD, is cathartic experience.

I highly recommend this film and the Special features section that accompanies the DVD. By doing this, it reminded me of the courage of the passengers aboard United 93, but also of the fortitude of the families. What was poignant in the Special Features section, particularly, was some of the actors in the film meeting family members of those who died, and the immense community cohesion that came together at a painful time.",1192924800,3,1237,4.880952380952381

I just didn't think this was a very good movie. It's not well executed and when it was over, I was mad and ready for some revenge! Of course this is the intended response and the manipulation of the audience by the film makers is just plain shameful! This felt like a bad TV movie and the viewers can't help but feel sad and angry while watching this movie. It's the equivalent to making a film about Jonbenet Ramsey back when the crime was fresh and having a graphic murder/sex scene showing the poor child's horrible demise! The DVD transfer looks very good, but I liked World Trade Center much more than this.",1190332800,2,745,4.290780141843972
1549387,3,B00005JOZI,"While this film does a great job of portraying the horror of the events and the evil of the terrorists, I can only give it three stars out of five because of too many grievances I have with it.

There were four men who made names for themselves on this flight: Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, Jeremy Glick and Mark Bingham.  Only Burnett and Glick are recognizable in this movie.  For most of the movie, I thought the actor playing Mark Bingham was supposed to be Beamer until he was swearing like a sailor which seemed out of character.  Then I thought maybe he was Glick until the Glick character said his name on a phone call.  I should not have had to do an internet search to figure out who the characters were.

The biggest rallying cry of 9/11 came from Todd Beamer's, ""Let's roll,"" but when I saw this in theaters I didn't hear it at all.  On video, I had to play back the ending a second time to find out that Beamer's famous statement is whispered so quietly in this movie you can barely hear it over the engine noise.  Then, after all the passengers seem to ignore him, he says, ""Let's go"" -  and they continue to sit in their seats!  Later, it is Glick who is shown leading the charge, but not in response to ""Let's roll.""

Of those four, only Glick's family is interviewed in the documentary.  In the commentary, Greengrass does not even mention Beamer's name.  He just says, ""That's the actor, David Alan Basche.""  It's up to us to figure out the character's name.  Why the subtle downplaying of the biggest folk hero on the plane?  He hardly even got any screen time.  But to watch this film, you would think every passenger in the plane was equally heroic in the fight against the cockpit.  Excuse me, but I don't honestly believe the trembling, crying women were battling the terrorists.  I'm sorry.

This is why the movie did not do well at the box office.  We wanted a movie that showed us our heroes.  Instead, we got a lot of egalitarian, ""Everybody's a hero"" hogwash.  To see the heroism that was, we have to see the TV movie, Flight 93, instead.",1189900800,3,2062,4.382585751978892
1549388,5,B00005JOZI,I finally brought myself to watch this film always fearful that I just was not ready for a 9/11 film. This is exquisite filmaking about the toughest day in our history for many Americans. Shot in documentary style with no star power but solid acting all around. Paul Greengrass respectfully chronicles the last flight of United 93 as passengers and crew arrive and terroists prep themselves for their mission. Knowing what will happen and watching the events unfold was riveting. I felt myself unable to move. It's gutwrenching at times especially as flight controllers watch the towers get hit right across the river from them. The crew and passengers of United 93 turn from passengers to heroes as they become aware of what's going on and that other flights have been rammed into the towers and the pentagon. That American can-do spirit leaves you feeling that we can overcome any horrible terror by coming together. An unbelievable movie experience.

It's a chance for us to not only remember the day but celebrate the bravery of the passengers on one flight on that tragic day.

Definitely a move worth seeing.  Beautiful, passionate, and well directed.  This day will live with all of us for the rest of our lives.  A movie like this helps us to remember that some people on that day showed their bravery and hopefully it will inspire us.

In the brilliant hands of British director Paul Greengrass, we have a film of passion, confusion, and full-circle resolution that is presented with the utmost care and concern; and profound respect. I was fascinated, riveted to the screen, and terribly moved by the film. The DVD extras, interviews with the famiies, are quite moving. This is really a film to be seen by all, if only to let people know that evil can be overcome with grit and determination. There is definitely strength in numbers.

1549391,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 was one I skipped over last year. Last year I took the view that any film made so close after 9/11 to be distributed wide in theaters that was about 9/11 was absolutely wrong, exploited Americans, and did not deserve my ticket money. But considering the high success United 93 had, the outstanding reviews it gathered, and its popularity at the Academy Awards, I decided to give this movie a chance at Blockbuster tonight.

I had read all over the place before I watched it that it was an extremely emotionally intense film. I am very attracted to these types of films because many times they cut right to the soul of you and make you wonder how lucky you are. I thought I had seen everything filmmakers had to offer in this genre. I was wrong.

From the very first scene, United 93 reaches out to you and brings you back six years ago to re-witness the terror America went through on the fateful day, September 11th, 2001. In a close-to-real-time manner, we are taken through--from start to finish--the morning that America will never forget.

MANY people still refuse to see this movie and others similar to it because they believe it is wrong to make such a film after the tragedy of 9/11. I can say with full confidence that ""United 93"" is not a piece of B-movie Hollywood over-dramatic crap set on the day of 9/11 to entertain audiences in a summer popcorn movie. United 93 is extremely tastefully done not to provide entertainment for its viewers...but what it does provide is something much more valuable, and that is terror. From the moment you start watching, you are pulled into your TV screen and experience every single gut-wrenching moment along with the passengers on United Flight 93. As if you were one of the passengers on the plane, you experience every ounce of terror, every single moment of fear, and every single bit of hate for the terrorists hijacking the plane. You are no longer wrapped up in a cozy blanket on your couch with your newly installed HD television set you put it into impress your successful neighbour. You're a passenger on Flight 93.

Paul Greengrass delivers an exquisitely directed film (one of the best direction jobs I have seen in my years as a movie critic) and paired with extraordinarily realistic acting performances by everyone in the film. The film is shot similar to a documentary and it truly makes you feel like you are watching rare camera footage that survived the crash instead of a film made in a studio. Everything about the film is so realistic, I'm actually having trouble calling it a ""film"" in this review.

Of course, United 93 is not for everyone. It is without a doubt the most emotionally powerful film I have ever watched and quite possibly the most terrifying movie I've ever sat through in all my years of seeing extreme horror films. The violence is extremely strong, very disturbing, and shockingly realistic. There are very few scenes free of peril and sometimes the emotional intensity gets so high you want to turn off the movie. But then you think of the people that really were on that plane--they couldn't just turn off the movie. They had to go keep fighting, and that thought alone will keep you watching.

But even so, this is more than a film showing the absolute terror that went on in the cabin of Flight 93. This is a film that shows true American spirit, and you feel compelled to join the brave men and women who attempt to storm the cockpit. You feel compelled to take up a weapon--which is anything you can find on the plane--and join the attempted take-back of the plane. And even though everyone who watches the film will know the outcome automatically...you still see that last beam of hope inside you. The last beam of hope that maybe, just maybe, these guys can take the terrorists down. Maybe, just maybe, the storm to the cockpit will work. And that's the moment you know that United 93 is more than just a movie...it's a true masterpiece.

To be sure, there had to be some element of speculation as to certain details, but thanks to cell phones and air phones, this is truly a true story.

One shocking aspect of the truth of what you'll see is how much incorrect information the decision-makers worked with while these historical tragedies required HUGE decisions to be made.

1549395,5,B00005JOZI,"'United 93' is a cinematic masterclass in how to make a movie of a major tragic event, in a tasteful and intelligent way. Not once does this film lapse into the over-sentimentality that others of its ilk succumb to.

Shooting the whole film on hand held cameras was a masterstroke on the part of director Paul Greengrass. The lack of steadycams and tracking shots lends the film an urgency and reality that was an absolute necessity for such a work. Greengrass also makes sure not to cast any established stars in any roles. To do this would be to Hollywoodise the whole situation and would take from the poignancy and realism of the picture.

The portrayals of the hijackers is also done in an original and gripping way. Both in their preparations and their in-flight actions, they are shown as nervous and trying to overcome their insecurities about their ""mission"". The obvious temptation to portray them as sadistic, soulless killers is side-stepped in order to deliver a more realistic portrayal. The same is true of the passengers. Although their actions are of course heroic, they are presented in a realistic and appropriate way that makes the film more powerful in its realism.

1549481,5,B00005JOZI,"Everybody remembers exactly where he was on September 11, 2001. I was taking a photojournalism course at the Defense Information School at Fort Meade, Maryland, and--ironically--taking part in an exercise on how military reporters should cover terrorist attacks. In fact, we were discussing the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and how, by the time the bombers came to trial, its significance had been buried because Americans' attention was diverted by the O. J. Simpson ""trial of the century."" At that moment, a Navy petty officer burst into the classroom and told our Air Force instructor to turn on the television--that the World Trade Center had just been struck by an airplane.

We laughed in disbelief. As Army soldiers, being suddenly thrust by cadre into ""live"" training scenarios was old hat. We thought we were going to cover a ""terrorist event"" as a practical writing exercise. But, when the projector switched from the PowerPoint slideshow to the live ""Today"" show broadcast, we knew from the ominous visual of smoke pouring from the North Tower that this was no exercise.

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, rumors abounded that Fort Meade was next, because the National Security Agency is located there. By day's end, I was standing outside our barracks, rifle in hand. I will never forget the emotions and thoughts that poured through me that day--revulsion, nausea, fear, anger, hatred. And finally, relief, because I had been spared the hell so cruelly inflicted on so many of my fellow Americans. As long as I live, I never want to relive that day. None of us do.

Thus, when trailers for United 93 began screening in Los Angeles theaters shortly before its release, some in the audience wailed, ""Too soon! Too soon!""  Too soon? From the morning Imperial Japan attacked the U.S. at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, until she surrendered in ignominious defeat on August 15, 1945, 1,348 days had passed. On April 28, 2006, United 93's opening day, 1,689 days of the War on Terror had gone by--almost a full year longer than America's involvement in World War II. Surely time enough has passed to allow us to reflect upon and honor those who died that day.

Although Americans were generally familiar with the events that took place on United Airlines Flight 93, most of what we knew had been the subject of dry news reportage and ""what if"" conjecture. Now, culling transcripts of cockpit flight recorders, 9-1-1 emergency calls, interviews with surviving family members, and eyewitness accounts, writer and director Paul Greengrass has taken the threads of innumerable and seemingly random facts, and woven them into a powerful visual narrative.

In United 93,Greengrass's masterful direction gives us the feeling that we are reliving September 11 all over again. He takes us from the flight's takeover by Muslim terrorists to the events on the ground as the World Trade Center and Pentagon are hit by the three other hijacked planes. He follows United 93's doomed course, in scenes inter-cutting between the airplane and the various air traffic control towers on the East Coast; he ends with the passengers retaking control of the plane from the hijackers, and its tragic crash in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

By transforming my theater seat into a cramped seat in coach, as the forty-first passenger alongside those who would soon die on that hijacked flight from Newark, Flight 93 thrust the events in my face with visual and aural brutality, compelling me to relive that day--and to recall its lessons.

Filming in ""real time,"" much like Fox TV's popular action series ""24,"" cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and his crew skillfully captured the action with handheld cameras. It's a method I usually eschew for its forced ""realism,"" but Ackroyd made it work by avoiding show-offish, unnecessary camera movement. By shooting mostly with telephoto lenses, he instills in viewers a sense of claustrophobia that heightens the emotional anxiety. John Powell's dark, percussion-laden soundtrack pummels the ears at rapid-fire tempo, ratcheting up the tension to cardiac arrest levels. Throughout the film, my own heart was racing, my brow was sweaty, and I got that same nauseous feeling in my gut that I so vividly remember from that day.

When the end credits rolled, there was nothing but dead silence in the theater where I saw it. United 93 masterfully achieved its objective of re-creating onscreen the nightmare that Americans went through on September 11th.

However, despite the fact that United 93 totally connected with me emotionally as a viewer, it suffers from the primary flaw of telling much of the story from the hijackers' point of view. The viewer learns more about what motivated them to take over the plane than he will ever find out about the private motives of the passengers, whose dialogue is rather threadbare. We know that through AirFone conversations with relatives, the passengers found out that hijacked planes had already hit New York and Washington, that their own flight therefore was doomed, and that this knowledge motivated them to wrest back control of the plane. But we never really find outwhat personally inspired each of them to their valorous actions. We never really get to know the Jeremy Glicks or Todd Beamers. I agree with those critics who have pointed that their dialogue should have been beefed up, and that these heroes should have been more clearly drawn.

Yet I don't think Greengrass himself fully understands what compelled the onboard rebellion. In a recent interview, he explained his film's depiction of the American passengers:

I suppose what I most wanted it to explore was the relationship between individual moments and collective will...You can't lead if the group's not there with the will, and vice versa. Where does leadership come from? It comes from the desire to be led...The order of the airplane was completely subverted...They seized control of the plane, pinned everybody in the back and they were in charge, and something happened in the course of 20-25 minutes...but you've always got that challenge of: what do you do when a bunch of people take over an airplane? You can't just sit there!

 While acknowledging and accurately depicting the American passengers' courage, the British director, it seems, hasn't begun to grasp the spirit of independence that most Americans still regard as their birthright. What induced these men and women to action could hardly be reduced simply to some group dynamic of a ""desire to be led""--remember, these were American, not German, passengers--but rather, embodied the individualistic, ""don't tread on me"" streak that fires us up when push comes to shove.

Fortunately, Greengrass's detachment does not undermine the movie's strengths. One scene in particular captures what makes the American spirit so unique and indomitable. As the passengers start attacking the hijackers to take back the plane, a frightened Swedish passenger tries to block them, standing astride the aisle like a lunch hall monitor. ""Just do what they say,"" he lectures. ""Give in to their demands...co-operate, and we will be safe."" The Americans must shove the Swedish weenie aside in order to reach their attackers and regain control of the cockpit. I have yet to see a more succinct metaphor for European dithering and condescension as obstacles to righteous American action.

Another critique--that United 93 is Politically Correct--is, I think, mostly unfounded. The movie makes no bones about distinguishing its villains from its heroes; it just does so without heavy-handed sloganeering, which would have wreckedthe taut, montage narrative structure. Composer Powell's menacing and foreboding passages, especially while the terrorists are praying, underscore their vicious brutality, just as upbeat, martial music accompanies scenes of Americans fighting back. Nor does the film disguise the facts that the hijackers were motivated by Islamism, or that the passengers took back the airplane to prevent its striking the U.S. Capitol, and, they hoped, to allow them to return safely to their loved ones.

A year after September 11, I spotted a bumper sticker on a passing car while driving the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Next to an image of the American flag were printed these words: ""9/11: Remember. Rebuild. Recover."" I could not help but think that there was one ""R"" missing in that slogan. United 93 does a brilliant job in reminding us that on a Boeing 757, a group of heroic citizens taughtus the response befitting a free people in the face of wanton savagery--Revenge. And the film left me experiencing another ""R"" as well: Reverence for the memories of those heroes.

Every American ought to invest two hours of his life in watching United 93, because it graphically depicts the inspiring acts, courage, and hope that helped spark the flames of direct action against Islamofascism. David Beamer, father of slain hero Todd Beamer, said of United 93: ""This film is a wake-up call. And although we abhor terrorism as a tactic, we are at war with a real enemy and it is personal.""

No, it is not too soon for this movie. Rather, let us hope that it is not too late.",1179619200,6,9201,5.093563370935634

1549483,5,B00005JOZI,"I'm going to be honest- it would feel really weird if I were to say I enjoyed this movie.  No, it was not a movie you can enjoy- it was a movie you can watch, and get a feeling of American history.  It's an important movie that anyone who was around in 2001 can understand.  It was such a horrible day, and this movie did a really good job at showing us *probably* what happened on that flight.

No one knows exactly what happened on that flight, but I'm guessing the creators used the phone calls from the people on the flight to gather information in order to make this movie.  For example, as someone was calling home to a relative or a friend, I'm guessing they used the sounds they heard in the background and put the pieces together to make up what probably happened, without being entirely sure.  No one knows for sure that the passengers used a giant tray to block the terrorists inside the cockpit, but maybe sounds were heard in the background that led to that being a possibility, since we have tapes of the phone calls being made.  Hey, I may be wrong, and I apologize if I am.

Well, I felt I needed to watch this movie and see what happened that horrible day, and maybe get a better idea of what may have happened on that flight.  The only thing I can say is that this is a movie that needs to be watched.",1178409600,3,1319,4.2023809523809526
1549484,4,B00005JOZI,"This real-time perspective was probably about as well done as is possible, unless you wanted a completely different movie with context, backstory, and speculation about all of 9/11. There will be plenty of opportunities for those movies in the future. I am pleased that this particular movie was made by these particular people.

With absolutely no coverage of events before 9/11 and nothing about the people on the flight, the movie seemed almost a tad strange given what we know now about the event and the individuals. I found myself wondering which person was Jeremy Glick, which one was Todd Beamer, and so on, and how the action would begin and play out. The film was spot-on in not being overly dramatic, not presenting the people as victims, and not distracting the story line with details about the passengers.

We don't know exactly what happened on the flight, of course. My impression was that the film got right what it could get right, using interviews, transcripts, and other sources, and found reasonable choices when it had to estimate. Even the very ending was probably wise, as it avoided a potentially controversial position on the last few seconds.

The film takes place in three segments: the uneventful early-day setup;  the initial hijackings and the realization among the controllers that the impossible to contemplate was actually unfolding; and 93 itself, including the implication that the delayed takeoff of 93 from Newark actually allowed the passengers to know they were part of a far bigger event and draw the horrible conclusions that prompted the action on board.

The use of relatively unknown actors and actresses was another smart move, avoiding the distraction of famous faces and re-inforcing the idea of a collection of random people thrown together, still capable of doing the exception. If someone like Clint Eastwood had been on the plane, the premise would have been ruined. I didn't realize until the director's remarks that Ben Sliney, the head of the national air traffic center and the one who shut down American air space, was played by himself. Fine move and a great job by Mr. Sliney and other other real controllers in the film.

The supporting material about the families is touching, and the director's commentary adds value.

So why only four stars or 4.5? The documentary approach, the number of non-acting professionals, the number of hand-held shots, the lack of character development, and so on, all make this an unusual film that I can't really judge against what constitutes a normal movie.

I also recommend Jere Longman's book for anybody interested in UAL 93.",1177804800,,2623,5.0137931034482754
1549485,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 recreates the tragic story of the flight that fought back against terrorist hijackers on 9/11. It goes deep into the story of the people on board and the people on the ground trying to figure out what is going on. The movie is about 2 hours long and starts from the first hijacking to the hijacking of 93 to the brave midair battle of passangers and hijackers to take control of the plane. Although no one knows what really happened, United 93 does its best to re create it. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1177545600,3,531,4.215686274509804
1549486,5,B00005JOZI,"This movie is about United 93, the one of the four hijacked flights on 9/11 that did not reach its target, because it crashed in a field after the passengers fought to regain control of the cockpit.  It does not follow a standard Hollywood format;  we don't get to know any of the characters well enough to really identify with them;  rather, the camera just watches key events (chaotically) unfold: on the plane, in air traffic control centers, and in military headquarters.

This movie was upsetting to watch, especially for someone who grew up in New York.  It brought back all the painful emotions associated with 9/11 which had been buried, perhaps too much, in my mind.  Some people might want to avoid watching this movie and reliving those feelings.  However there are good reasons to watch this, aside from a depressive desire to wallow in trauma.

For one thing, we get a fascinating behind-the-scenes view of how air traffic control works.  Much of the movie is really about information:  how information is transmitted and processed.  There is a lot of confusion on the ground as air traffic control gradually learns what is happening;  it is not clear which flights have been hijacked (and the audience shares this confusion too, unless you remember the actual flight numbers).  More importantly, information is key to what happened on flight 93.  The passengers were able to sneak phone calls to the ground; and when they learned about the world trade center, they came to the rational (but no less heroic) realization that they had nothing to lose and much to gain by attacking the hijackers, even though this defied the conventional wisdom that the safest thing to do is to quitely wait to be ransomed.

It is also interesting, and inspiring, that the ordinary passengers on the plane accomplished more than our massive and expensive military organization, which was unable to organize an effective response in time.

Even though we know more or less what is going to happen, the tension in the movie builds up steadily, without letting up, until it reaches an almost unbearable level.  You won't be taking any restroom breaks.  Near the end, some of the elements became a bit repetitive, but the conclusion is still cathartic.

Bonus features on the DVD include biographies of the victims on United 93, along with interviews with their families regarding the making of the film.  There is also a director commentary which seems interesting, although I didn't have time to listen to much of it.",1177372800,2,2510,4.888888888888889
1549487,5,B00005JOZI,"This is not an easy film to watch and yet it felt important to make myself do it.  I agree with every review here that says that everyone needs to see this.  We have to remember.  We have to understand that even though we've all gone back to our normal lives (those who are lucky enough to do that), these monsters are still out there, still plotting to kill the rest of us, still hating with every fiber of their being.

They see us as evil.  Imagine what their movie would look like if they made one from THEIR point of view.  The passengers on United 93 would have horns and tails and be engaged in orgies and child sacrifice before the brave hijackers took the vile plane to the ground.

That's how they see us and that's why they dedicate themselves to kill us.  That reality should overshadow all political posturing.

But this film simply tries to recreate what happened on September 11th, 2001.  And it's far more disturbing than any overblown propaganda or Hollywood melodramatics.  This happened.

We see the people who actually were there on 9/11; from the air traffic controllers to the military.  We see the chaos that engulfed everone that day.  The only ones who were not in this film were the people who perished on United Airlines flight 93.  What makes that element of the film work so well is that there are no known actors to play the passengers.  Director Paul Greengrass should be commended for not taking the high road.  It's a film that should be celebrated for the patriotic spirit of all Americans who fight tyrany in the face of evil.  A film for all to see!,1176595200,,712,4.374045801526718

This film lets us sit in a seat in the plane, and in the chairs of air traffic controllers and others who had to try to figure out what the hell was happening that morning. No well-known actors are there to destroy the realism. No on-screen narration distracts from the confusion felt by the characters, all real folks. It's a movie one only needs to see once. When you see it, you get mad and sad all over again. Then you come back to 2007 and realize the guy who made it happen is still alive in Pakistan or Afghanistan or who knows where, more than five years later, probably laughing at our mess in Iraq and at the fact that even in Khandahar and Kabul we haven't fully defeated him. Could anyone have believed, on 9/12/01, that by 2007 Osama Bin Laden and his doctor friend/fiend/spokesman would still be alive and free, while these passengers and that crew are long dead and in danger of being forgotten?",1175212800,,1160,4.450704225352113
1549603,5,B00005JOZI,"Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy) brings us United 93, a real-time rendering of the events that happened on one of the most fateful days of our lifetime. We first meet the four young men who hijacked the flight, then are introduced to the passengers on the plane, air traffic controllers, the FAA, and a military command center. The first portion of the film centers on the first three hijacked planes on 9/11; we watch, impossibly, as the FAA, air traffic controllers, and the military try and respond to a threat that literally appeared out of nowhere, and the difficult, time-sensitive decisions that needed to be made. It certainly gives one pause to think: what would *I* do if faced with such a catastrophe? When the focus switches to United 93, the film gathers considerable momentum. Although there is a relatively large ""cast"", Greengrass does an enviable job humanizing all of them. It would have been easy to sweep over each person and create a character that was close to the original but still clichd, or worse yet caricaturized. In less skilled hands, this may have happened. But Greengrass obviously did his research, learned as much as he could about the people on that plane, and brought them to life in short time. That's not easy to do.

Greengrass deserves further commendation for constraint. It would have been easy to turn this into a melodramatic affair, but instead he merely dramatized. He showed us the events as they took place, he showed us the passenger's emotions, and asked us to respond. And we responded! How could we not cheer as the passengers began their revolt? Rejoice at their bravery when they broke into the cockpit and wrested away control of the plane? Cry when we spied in on passenger's conversations with family and loved ones, especially knowing that Greengrass researched the passenger's lives extensively and that the conversations were more likely than not accurately depicted.

This is a review of the DVD, and it gets extra high marks from me for the Bonus Features, particularly the interviews with family members. First, they were subtitled, which is sadly still a rarity (I'm hearing impaired, so miss out on most of the bonus/special features); most importantly, though, they reminded us that these were all real people. Next door neighbors. Friends. Co-workers. Brothers, sisters, uncles, parents.

The passengers of United 93 deserve a standing ovation from all of us. They were part of a tragedy, indeed, but they fought to stave off an even greater tragedy.",1174780800,4,2532,4.9810874704491725
1549604,5,B00005JOZI,"This dramatization of the events on and surrounding United Flight

93 on 9/11 is truly worthy of a five star rating.  The almost

real time pacing of events in the air and on the ground is

excellent.  A completely engrossing film, even knowing most of

the story beforehand.

A number of people - probably none who will read this -

have said it is ""too soon"" or ""too depressing"" to tell

this story.  While I understand those emotions, on viewing

this film, I think it is worth noting that the families of

those involved were, judging from the commentary, positively

involved in this film.

To me, this film is really a variation on a theme in war

movies - the decision to engage in a high risk battle with

the hopes of ultimately minimizing casualties.  And, like

Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"", I see this as a war

movie, just not in a battle zone that America is used to

seeing.  And to their credit, the passengers/crew of United 93

did ultimately thwart the terrorist attack plan and saved

many lives.

I did not find this film as emotionally intense as ""World

Trade Center"".  But potential viewers should keep in mind

there are scenes of violence and of course the ending will

upset some people.",1174435200,,1221,4.553488372093023
1549605,5,B00005JOZI,"Although United 93 involved no well known actors or actresses, the performances in this film were exceptional.  The actors that portrayed the air traffic controllers, military command center personnel, stewardesses, pilots, and of course the passengers and terrorists commanded an intense presence with such an emotional and realistic subject matter.  The film's editing, camera work, and direction are all worthy of Oscar awards.  Director Paul Greengrass delivers a picture that defies Hollywood melodrama and instead pointedly recreates in real time the events that occurred on board United flight 93, the morning of Sept. 11th 2001. The film kept me on edge throughout its almost 2 hour run time.  This was not done through theatrical artificiality, but through tight editing, ultra realistic performances from the actors, and the tension broiling amongst the air traffic controllers, military commanders, the terrorists and the passengers.  This film should be viewed by every Amercian citizen as a wake-up call to the security vulnarabilities that our societal freedoms engender.  Greengrass offers no solutions, only what he envisioned regarding the fate of United flight 93 on that dreadful morning.",1174176000,3,1207,5.604395604395604
1549606,5,B00005JOZI,"I have to say that this film has far exceeded my expectations. The docudrama style is thankfully unsensational and believable. It was absolutely the correct direction to take and Paul Greengrass should and has been saluted for that. It would have seemed disrespectful in the extreme to have made this into some sort of bombastic, jingoistic popcorn fodder but what we are presented with here is a muted, mature, faithful legacy to those on board that doomed flight. I find it unbelievable reading comments saying the film is boring because this is about showing us the reality as far as we know it of what happened, about being a tribute to those who refused to be victims and whose spirit to fight back took over and about posing the difficult questions as to how this was able to happen. I'm sure entertainment never entered into it.

Besides, I was on an emotional rollercoaster from the very start. Watching the mundane actions of the flight crew and passengers as they board and prepare for take off unaware of what lies ahead, watching the confusion and chaos in the control rooms, seeing the nervous shiftiness of the four unassuming hijackers, hearing the verbatim final messages to loved ones and the overwhelming final mutiny were all so gripping, tense and moving. Scenes throughout were so well executed with the editing deserving special mention, especially the frantic scenes on the ground between the military command room, control centres and airport towers, you get a real sense of the chaos and the bewilderment as reality dawns on those watching it all unfold.

Another wise decision Greengrass took was to only make a nod to the other three hijacked flights, rather than attempt to recreate any scenes on board those planes. We only hear about them as an off trajectory flight number or see them as a moving dot on a control screen. When there is suddenly no response from that flight or worse, it simply disappears from the control screen, we can only imagine what the situation is like aboard that plane. We know what has happened and there is no need for confirmation.

There is so much more that can be said but other reviews have already sung such praises. That the film won such favour with the relatives of those on board gives the film another level of added worth. It was nice to hear some of them talk about the film as being a cathartic experience and that they felt a little peace afterwards. That's a real testament to United 93's noble intentions and perfect execution. It is a terrific piece of cinema.",1174089600,7,2537,4.7482993197278915

The bravery and resolution of the passengers filled me with admiration and a sense of terrible loss.

This movie is amazing and so harrowing, I highly recommend this film because United 93 is so much more moving than Oliver Stone's stiff and uninspiring, World Trade Center. Greengrass truly wrote a wonderful and moving story and it breaks my heart to think of the real life passengers abroad that plane on that fateful day. United 93 never seems wishy washy, flimsy or contrived in any way. This film is told with class and that's the best word to describe this gut-wrenching film. Please do not wait to buy this movie, it will touch you profoundly.

However, we can't really say we actually know or fully understand what truely took place, or how the events really unfolded aboard all 4 airplanes. However, the good thing about this movie is that it does shed some light on the subject, and it tries to give the people some insight as to what happened. Can anyone honestly say that this movie is completely, without a shadow of a doubt, accurate? Absolutely not! Can anyone honestly say that this is how it happened? Absolutely not! But, this movie does try to give you a pretty good idea. I won't lie, at times this movie is very hard to watch especially knowing how everything turns out. I guess what mostly got to me, is the fact that I knew what I was watching wasn't a movie, or something just for entertainment, but these people actually lost their lives on this plane. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried. I cried to myself thinking that things may have turned out differently if those brave individuals would've just gotten to the cockpit of the plane a little sooner than they did. I cried about the thought of having to call my family and friends to tell them goodbye because I'm about to die. I cried because a whole lot of innocent people suffered and ultimately paid the price for something they had absolutely nothing to do with. This movie also shows you how unprepared and surprised the U.S Government officials were while these events were taking place. This movie cleared up a lot of unanswered questions for me. Like, how could guys with sharpened nail filers and small pocket knives hijack a plane full of people? I'm glad to say that this movie added plausibility to that scenario for me. I find it astonishing that I have read reviews with people complaining about the cinematography, and other useless crap like that. Let's get for real, I think this movie was done with what was important..RESPECT! For the families of the victims. I think this movie would've been extremely disrespectful if there were a lot of special effects dumbing it down. That's typical Hollywood fashion anyway. To make money off of other people's tragedies. I must say that cinematography was the furthest thing from my mind while I was watching this movie, and if I wanted special effects or cinematography I could've watched ""The Matrix"" or ""Lord of the Rings"". This movie was way too serious to make light of. I'm also glad they didn't get a whole lot of big screen actors and actresses to portray these real life people, therefore, making it a whole lot more believable in my opinion. I find it hard to believe the validity of a real life events with Nicholas Cage, Maria Bello, and Michael Pena as the stars of the movie like ""World Trade Center"". That's portraying it like it's nothing more than another action/drama movie, or some kind of made for T.V movie.

1549670,4,B00005JOZI,"United 93 is easily one of the ten best films of 2006.  Although it received no Oscar at the 79th Academy Award Ceremony three days ago, it is still even a better film than the year's Oscar winner The Departed in categories of Best Picture and Best Editing--where United 93 really succeeds the most.

I've asked several people if they had seen the film, but I always get a no.  Well, people don't know what they're missing.  They see the cover of this box and are reminded of their responsibility to the 9/11 events.  They don't want to talk about the 9/11 horrors because it makes them think about stuff.

The people who refuse to watch the movie don't get it; it's got nothing to do with the film.  It doesn't go preaching on morality or anything of the kind.  It is simply THE MOST SUSPENSEFUL FILM PRODUCTION OF 2006.

If one is interested in anything, he would be interested in just peering through this window to see how air traffic control operates.  It's as realistic as film gets!  It shows what air traffic control looks like on a day-to-day affair.  Then, things start going wrong, but no matter how wrong things get, the film suspense is heightened not by cheap thrills, but by the characters' need to act immediately because other planes flying around the country still have to be directed.  After Control verifies multiple planes are hijacked, we see an air traffic controller manager tell his controllers to ground all airplanes, no exceptions.  This helps to lighten the burden of dealing with renegade and out-of-contact, hijacked aircraft.

The film has three points of view.  It has the perspective of the civilian air traffic controllers, the perspective of the military air traffic controllers, and the perspective of the people on flight United 93 of both the hijackers and the innocent occupants.  None of this film is influenced by any kind of politics!  It's purely interested in the human element of those three points of view, and in how they interrelate.  There are no politics in this film.  It's completely devoid of politics!  It's a suspense film about the details of those three points of view on that day.  It's an action film because its suspense works and follows through.  It's not brainless, I promise.  When flight United 93 goes down in the film, it is so emotional, it moves one to tears.  It's because of the heroism of the civilians rebelling against the hijacking.  The people on flight United 93 saved the day with their heroism, and this film is about that heroism.  It's got nothing to do with politics.  This is about gut-wrenching suspense and realism.",1172620800,5,2601,4.745535714285714

Paul Greengrass succeeds brilliantly and beautifully in his Oscar-nominated direction of this film that is both well-made and respectful to the fallen heroes. There are no corny backstories in an attempt to gain tears from the audience. No, Greengrass takes a more effective approach by simply showing the events in real time. The casting for this film is excellent, as the ensemble of unknown actors contribute to the sense that these are average people who combat terrorism and impending doom with extraordinary bravery. The true beauty of this film is the subtle detail. For example, at the beginning, when all appears normal, a man working at a computer offscreen can be heard casually commenting that one of the soon to be found out as hijacked aircraft has turned 10 degrees offcourse. Later, the tips of the World Trade Center can just be seen out of an airplane window. This skillful cinematography makes United 93 a masterpiece.",1172534400,4,1133,4.875647668393782

The tragic ending that we all know is coming is nevertheless unbearable. It is so well-researched, with all the families on board before production began, that the similarity between actors and victims is eerie.  The depth and sensitivity in their depiction leave the impression the filmmakers left no detail unconsidered from the information gathered from the victims' loved ones. The terrorists are portrayed as complex people in their own right, making final calls on cell phone to their own loved ones, and praying as hard to Allah as the American passengers pray to their Christian God. How that day unfolded is presented as the complicated, chaotic chain of events it was. Quiet heroism and quick action, as well as critical mistakes and frightening ineptitude by key Americans on the ground, are not overlooked.

United 93 is a tribute to the men and women aboard, striving to be as honest as possible based on what we know, avoiding the sensationalism of a Hollywood blockbuster. The movie ends before the point of impact, and footage of the real crash is not shown.

I've heard so many people say they ""just can't see it,"" avoiding painful memories.  When I've recommended the film to friends, most quickly change the subject:  the fate of that aircraft is as excruciating now as it was then.  This is not an easy film to watch, but seeing it somehow pays respect to these American heroes.

Included is an expansive menu of extras I watched over and over again. In them you'll learn a great deal about the victims and their families, and how the film was approached and researched. Read the bios: this was truly a remarkable group of people.  By fighting back together as they faced their own deaths, they saved the lives of many on the ground, and might have been seconds away from saving themselves. Heartbreaking, but recommended viewing.",1172275200,7,2103,4.862745098039215
1549673,5,B00005JOZI,"I appreciated the movie for covering both the process and the emotions of that day. The language of the air traffic control system was reasonably close to reality. The lack of coordination between the civilian and military air controllers was real but perhaps over dramatized. Lacking was a discussion of the  pitifully small forces dedicated to the protection of our air frontiers, the time required to launch and the geometry of an air intercept.

As mentioned in another of my posts I have immense appreciation for the effort of the passengers to gain control of the aircraft. The writings on the subject have, in my opinion, not devoted sufficient focus to the role of the muscle hijackers, their weapons and training. I am also of the opinion that the skill of the pilots has been grossly underestimated.

To be sure we do not really not know what happened during the last few minutes of the flight. The movie takes some liberties with speculation. However, this is true with most things in movies and history. We seldom know the full story.

My personal guess is that the passengers did get into the cockpit. Their they were confronted by the fundamental problem of attacking inside an aircraft.  If the crew are strapped in they can push the nose down so that the passengers are weightless and make it difficult for them to move. However, once the nose of a commercial jet ( unlike a military jet) gets too low a recovery is almost impossible. One thing that appears to have been glossed over in every account of 9-11 is the professionalism of the pilots flying the hijacked airplanes. To me there is little doubt that these were well trained pilots and that the bozos who attended flight schools in the US were simply backups.

The passengers who fought for control of the airplane refused to be lead to a slaughter and it doing so may have saved thousands or perhaps even tens of thousands of lives.  Thank god for those who had the guts to try.",1172016000,3,1954,4.662790697674419
1549674,5,B00005JOZI,"Writing the title of my review just now gave me chills.  Awesome!  This movie works on every level imaginable.  It is a masterful, technical achievement that is impressive througout under the supremely talented eye of director Paul Greengrass.  His Oscar-nomination for his work here is more than justly deserved. I sincerely hope he wins.  The characters are all humanistic and easy to care about.  Even the terrorists, who embark on a crime against humanity, come across as real people who sincerely believe in what they are doing.  Creepy.  There is the underlying tension at the beginning as passengers and crew board the doomed flight, and one cannot help but hope the plane never takes off at all, that some technical problem will keep the plane grounded and safe; the people aboard returned to their families.  The idea of using hand-held cameras throughout the movie intitially turned me off from seeing this film.  Normally, under most circumstances, I despise hand-held camera-work as it comes across as amateurish and annoying.  But in this film the increasing tension aboard the plane makes use of hand-held cameras more kinetic.  Using absolutely no ""name actors"" in the movie also adds to the effect of feeling like one of the passengers.  The acting from the entire cast is superb.  Watching this film made me feel as though I were re-living 9/11 all over again.  This film is terrifying, exhilirating to the point you want to scream, and outstanding filmmaking in every way.

After watching the chaos unfold from the local air traffic controllers to the FAA and the Military operations during 9/11, I am very thankful that I don't work in any of those industries.  These modern day heroes remained as calm and professional as possible while watching the events unfold in disbelief.

The reluctant heroes on board flight 93 literally fought with their last breaths.  Their families and friends should be very proud.

1549677,4,B00005JOZI,"This movie is intense, realistic, unflinching and moving.  That is not to say it is a fantastic film - it is efficient and appropriate to the subject matter, but is definitely not shot in a cinematic style - it is claustrophobic and more interested in authenticity of characters and events than in exciting style - as well it should be.  This works perfectly as you are never taken out of the feeling that you are actually watching the events unfold.

The movie is essentially a real time depiction of events on the plane, along with corroborating scenes in air traffic control, and especially the relatives on the receiving end of phone calls from the planes.  The script and what we see has been hung primarily on the phone calls made from the plane on mobiles and air phones, giving the events a horrible authenticity.  It is not the memory of two dimensional bad guys on a suicide mission you remember - the politics and response are not addressed here - it is above all the trauma and agonising loss of the people left on the ground that you remember - the real cost of the loss of United 93. It is impossible to watch and not imagine you and your loved ones in that situation - and this is where the film is a success, it makes a huge geopolitical terrorist event something personal and real to each of us.

A story of heroism in the face of tragedy that is an essential watch.",1170547200,,1383,4.425196850393701
1549678,5,B00005JOZI,"In 2006 two major motion pictures about September 11, 2001 were released.  One, WORLD TRADE CENTER, was a film from Oliver Stone about two first responders who were saved from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  Though WORLD TRADE CENTER is a good and solid film, it does not reach the achievement that Paul Greengrass was able to do with UNITED 93.

Filmed in a style that seems to be a dreamy cinema verite (though every moment on film was carefully constructed), UNITED 93 tells the story about the one plane that went down on September 11th that didn't hit its target.  United 93 was supposed to have crashed either into the White House or the Capitol Building, but because of the bravery and courage displayed by the men and women on board, the plane never reached that area and crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  No one alive can say exactly for sure what happened aboard the plane that day.  However, UNITED 93 does an incredible job of recreating what possibly happened.

Paul Greengrass and the filmmakers spent an incredible amount of time talking with the family members of those who died.  They listened intently to the tape recordings on board the plane and messages left behind.  I'm sure that hundreds of hours of research went into creating the film and it shows on film.  No big name actors were cast in the film and many of the smaller roles were played by people who had actually been involved somehow with United 93 on September 11th.  It is an ensemble cast of the truest kind.

I was deeply moved while watching UNITED 93.  The outcome is already known before even putting the film into the DVD player.  Yet, the foreknowledge takes nothing away from the experience.  The people on the plane reminded me of some of my own friends and family members and even though I knew they were going to die, their actions as portrayed in the film gave me hope.  UNITED 93 is a powerful piece of cinema, testifying to what ordinary people can do when faced against extraordinary circumstances.  The Academy might have ignored it, but UNITED 93 is the best picture of 2006 and a fitting tribute to the men and women who died that day.

The DVD includes a commentary with Director Paul Greengrass which I found much more interesting, intriguing, and thought-provoking than many other commentaries I have listened to.  There's also a short documentary entitled ""United 93:  The Families and the Film"" that interviews family members of those killed and their reactions to the film.  Finally, there is a biography page that includes a small picture and a written biography about the 40 people on board (not including the hijackers) who died because of the hijacking.",1170201600,75,2692,4.733905579399142
1549729,5,B00005JOZI,"Though it has been over five years since the devastation of 9/11 the memory lives on, a day no one will ever forget - nor should we.  This viewer waited until UNITED 93 was released on DVD to view it, thinking that watching the film in the security of the home might make it less threatening. But what Paul Greengrass has created in reconstructing those few hours in 2001 that changed the psyche of the world forever is an achievement in courage, in understatement, and in respect  - as fine a memorial as any that has been planned.

In using not easily recognizable but very fine actors in all of the roles, Greengrass allows his script to unfold gradually in the relaxed atmosphere of the usual air flight plans and minor delays, conversations heard by all of us as we await a take off of a plane.  Concurrently he shows the four men, whose mission is to destroy 'the oppressors', prepare, pray, dress, and board.  Then he moves into the planning rooms of air control, lets us feel the insidious progression of the hijacked planes, shows us the military response and paralysis, places us back in United 93, and unfolds the recognition by the crew and passengers of the danger in which they have been placed. The acts of heroism seem like natural permutations of human response all the way to the final abrupt dark screen when the plane goes down.

The degree of tension Greengrass and his superlative cast and crew convey is almost intolerable: magnify that times infinity power and we have a glimpse of what it was like to be in United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001.  The film is a remarkable achievement and is destined to become a hallmark for artistic representation of historic events.  Highly Recommended on every level.

1549731,5,B00005JOZI,"We all know what happened on Sept 11th 2001. It was horrific at the time watching events unfold. At the time, it felt like Armageddon. It was never going to be an easy task to create a film based on factual events that took place on that fateful day.

Paul Greengrass has done a superb job. The film plays like a documentary and is very accomplished at showing the full horror as events unfolded. The tension on the plane is unbelievable both for the hijackers and the passengers. The same is true in the air traffic control area when they start realising planes have been hijacked.

While watching the film, we all know there isn't going to be a happy ending but the director and writer, Paul Greengrass, is sympathetic to the plights of everyone involved. He even manages to convey the stress felt by the hijackers before and during the events.

I must compare this film to Oliver Stone's film ""World Trade Center"" which I thought was too subjective and too pro-American.""United 93"" is a far superior film. It doesn't preach.",1169683200,13,1027,4.631868131868132
1549732,5,B00005JOZI,"Every once in awhile, a film comes along that is so understated that it blows me away, and this was such a film.  By concentrating on the mundane details that the passengers, crew, and air traffic controllers were dealing with at the time of the attacks on America, Greengrass puts together a stunningly cinema verite representation of the actual events.

By using all unknown actors (as well as a few actual ATC staff, playing themselves) the director sensitively portrays the confusion, the conflict, the struggle, and the heroism that ensued.  At its core, United 93 is a human tragedy, and Greengrass' meticulous, real-time recreation of every moment from boarding to impact reminds us of the human impact of the event.

The film is extremely intense and realistic, but if the viewer can handle the underlying reality of the film, it is well worth the emotional toll it inflicts on the viewer.  For a more emotionally wrenching tragic/heroic double feature, consider watching United 93 and Oliver Stone's equally intense World Trade Center in one sitting.  You'll be haunted by the ghosts of that terrible day when the world, quite literally came crashing down around us, and recall with terrible clarity your feelings from that day.

Some people think it is too soon to open these wounds from which our country is still healing, but these sensitive profiles in courage stand as a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives on that terrible day in our nation's history.",1169510400,16,1477,4.955465587044534

1549734,5,B00005JOZI,"Invariably, the first question people asked upon this film's release was ""is it too soon?"" Absurd, really. Whether we want it to be or not, 9/11 is the defining event of our lives. It's about time we talked about it like grownups, not bumper stickers.

The second question people asked is ""why,"" as in, why make this movie? Conspiracy theorists aside, most people are fully aware of what happened that day. The heroics of United Flight 93 are well-documented - do we need the facts recounted for us one more time?

Except movies are not simply recounting of facts, as much as An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge is a recounting of a hanging. The best filmmaking brings flesh to bone and there are few dancing skeletons that could use more humanity than 9/11. More a political football than a living, breathing thing, its dusty remains are trotted out for a cabaret routine every time there's photo opportunity to be had, an election to be won, or someone wants to wiretap our phones. We live under the specter 9/11, slaves to a ghost we can feel but not always see.

Above all other things, Paul Greengrass' wonderful United 93 reminds us that the victims and perpetrators of 9/11 are human beings; the bin Ladens and Bushes of the world (and indeed, the participants in this film) may invoke God in their struggles, but that terrible day in September was very much the act of man. Mohammed did not hijack a plane - Mohammed Atta did. This should be obvious, but sadly, it is not. We find comfort in order, not chaos, and there are few things more chaotic to our structured existence of traffic jams, ATMs, and Starbucks than mass death played out live on CNN. 9/11 began as a day like any other; the people on United flight 93 showered, shaved, had children, ate breakfast, made small talk, and cried when faced with their own mortality. What happened on that airplane happened, not to angels, but people, and these people could very well been us.

And we are quite alone.

I can't help but chuckle every time I read a new 9/11 conspiracy theory when, in truth, the federal government is too bureaucratically inept to manage any complex sinister plot adequately. There is no shadowy figure pulling all the strings - indeed, President Bush is notable in United 93 for his complete absence (I interpret this is a statement rather than a lack one). It's a scary world; in a way, we're all in the cockpit of United flight 93, hurtling towards the ground, grabbing feebly at controls we don't even know how to use.

Some may see this as cynical. I see it as empowering. When I was younger, I remember driving home from Yankee Stadium, peering across the river at the Manhattan skyline and thinking man was truly capable of great things. Those terrorists took part of the greatness away that day, but the passengers of flight 93 put a different kind of transcendence in its place. The nobility of gods is un-relatable; it is the nobility of man that inspires.

Interesting footnote: Lewis Alsamari, an Iraqi-born British actor who plays one of the hijackers, tried to attend the U.S. premiere of United 93 but was refused a visa for having been a member of the Iraqi army. Alsamari had been conscripted into service and deserted in 1993, living in Britain under refugee status since that time.",1168992000,4,3286,4.655172413793103
1549735,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93

When we walk into a movie theater, we expect entertainment, we expect to laugh, we expect to cry, but very few times we go into a movie theater expecting to honor. When I went to the theater to see United 93, I went in and sat down in the auditorium, before the movie had started; I noticed that the audience was very quiet, almost a mysterious hush. Unlike other films, we already know what is going to happen in United 93, nothing could've prepared us for what we were about to witness.

The movie is based on one of many stories that happened on September 11, 2001, the day that America was hit with the worst terrorist attack in its history. United Airlines flight 93 was the fourth and final hijacked plane on Sep. 11. The movie recreates the ill-fated trip in real time from takeoff to hijacking, to the passengers and crew, their families on the ground, and the flight controllers who watched in utter disbelief. Over the course of two hours, on board flight 93, these disconnected strangers form into allies, who were not afraid to look death in the eye and confront an unthinkable situation.

Director Paul Greengrass creates a realistic world that not since Saving Private Ryan has a film been more involving. Most of the camera shots are done via handheld to create a disturbing sensation of realism. It is also shot in a very documentary style so that we are separated from other Hollywood thrillers. Greengrass also wrote the screenplay, which is also unique, the dialogue has such a natural feel to it. He creates a random and realistic dialogue that grabs your attention the whole way through.

The film's strength lies in its cast, the first thing that we notice is that none of these actors are recognizable. These actors come off the screen as real people, we do not catch ourselves saying, ""he has had better performances"" or "" I hate her hair that way"". There is no gossip or Oscar buzz surrounding these performers. There are also appearances by real life witnesses on that dreaded day; Ben Sliney was the director of flight operations for the FAA on 9/11; he was originally brought on as an advisor to the film, but Paul Greengrass invited him to work on the set and relive that tumultuous experience, and he was cast as himself in the film.

There are certain scenes in United 93 that make the audience shake: The plane being fueled, the hijacking, and of course the ""lets roll"" scene. I noticed the audience scratching their heads, adjusting their seats, getting angry, and emotionally drained. As an audience, we expect most movies to have happy endings... watching United 93, we catch ourselves hoping for a different ending, but that is not the case. This movie serves as a memorial to those 45 brave souls who saved the Capital building, and hundreds or perhaps thousands of people on September 11, 2001.

There was a lot of debate that the time was not right for a movie like this to be released.

What unfolds (shockingly) is the chaos that went on behind the scenes on this day- not a wild chaos, just an utterly baffled and lost state of affairs. Left hands didn't know what right hands were doing. In point of fact, no one had a clue what to do or whom to turn to. The movie sentimentalizes nothing. Its depiction of the events aboard United 93 feels so real that you cannot help but identify and wonder what you would have done if you'd been a passenger.

So subdued that even scenes with characters shouting are played in wide shots to mute their impact.  And we as an audience are lulled into a kind of trance.  By showing every little mundane detail, the pouring of a drink, characters having a trivial conversation, we stop watching a clean calculated work of artifice, and our minds accept it not as recreation, but as real life.  After one hour, we as a viewer are ON that plane.  So when the true terror comes, we are not prepared.  Our defenses are down, and we are STILL on that plane.  Hostages to Greegrass' masterful creation.  It's one of the most harrowing moviegoing events I've ever seen.  And the result is a deeply fulfilling catharsis.  Tragedy in art exists not to make us sad, but to give us an emotional release.  United 93 gives you that in spades.  And what's most amazing above all that is that it manages to stay completely respectful to its subject matter.  A rare movie that manages to make all of its protagonists equal in both their heroism and their vulnerability.  No one is diminished.  No one is praised above the others.

1549806,5,B00005JOZI,"This is an amazing movie.  After purchasing the DVD, I have seen it twice, the second time while listening to Paul Greengrass' commentary. Along with his interesting and informative details of the film-making itself and the casting of professional actors along with real-life professionals who either played real-life people or, in some cases, actually played themselves, he also provides some revealing and, some might say, politically 'incorrect' commentary.  Since, along with most of the world's population, I know that my own life has changed post 9/11, I can say with learned confidence that Greengrass' political commentary couldn't be more on the mark. In his softly spoken and respectful words, he reminds us that we are all currently passengers on Flight 93 as we grapple with what to do with a world that has appeared to have gone mad.  While we Americans watch as our country is seemingly taken in a bizarre different direction other than what we would think would be the correct course of capturing Bin Laden and destroying his terrorist organization, so too does the rest of the world look on with increasing discouragement and disappointment as a once powerful country stumbles and errs (along with Great Britain) as it tries to reassure the world that our government knows what it is doing and will 'stay the course'.  This movie is true contemporary art as it captures not only what took place on 9/11 but also what is happening now as we continue to try to come to grips with our world.  Was it too soon to make this movie?  Hardly---it may be too late.  Yes, this movie has to be rated R for the intensity and violence but, on the other hand, it should be seen by everyone over the age of 13.

You are also on board United Flight 93 as the terrorists hijack the plane and terrorize the passengers. You also watch the heroic efforts of the passengers to retake control of the plane.

Although it is a mix of what is known and what is surmised based on the best available, albeit fragmentary knowledge, it is a forthright depiction of the events of a day that we must not forget.  It takes an uninformed moron (both ignorant and stupid!) to believe something other than radical Islam was behind 911 or the military actually shot down UA 93.  I don't care if the producers turned a profit off this film.  Bravo to the cast and crew!",1167350400,,592,4.4953271028037385

If the reader is interested in reading a more plausible account of what really must have happened, I recommend Webster Griffin Tarpley's ""9/11 Synthetic Terror"".

Tarpley suggests in a more realistic and also politically incorrect version that United 93 was downed by a US air defence system military jet in order to protect the White House.

A more courageous director would have ended the movie leaving an open final and leaving the moviegoer wondering whether United 93 came down as per the ""official version"" presented in this movie or by the more uncomfortable ending suggested by Tarpley's excellent book.

However, this different ending would most likely have been banned from 99% of American theatres and categorized as unpatriotic and un-American.",1167264000,3,897,5.258741258741258
1549871,5,B00005JOZI,"On the September 11th, 2001 at about 5PM Moscow's time which is about 9AM in NYC I took a taxi to go home. The radio in the cab was on and the driver told me: ""You know, they say an airliner rammed into one of the twin towers in New York"". My first thought was: ""How is that possible? You can't hit a skyscraper with an airplane, they don't fly that low over NYC. Even in case of emergency they'd rather make it into Hudson river"" - as one of the characters of United 93 says. Some time later while I was still in the taxi we heard about the second plane that hit the southern tower. Right off I understood it's a terrorist attack, but still I had this feeling of irreality about what was going on. Even when I got home, turned on the TV and saw both WTC buildings on fire, I couldn't believe my own eyes. ""That's impossible - I thought - that just can't be. It only happens in movies"". 9/11 was the day everyone understood such things might happen in real life also. It was the first day that sent previous era to past - era of world's relative serenity and carelessness. From that day on we all suspect our telephone calls are being eavesdropped, we have to take off our shoes in airports, and some of us are even being bombed.

This total tranquility is conveyed great in the beginning of United 93. The last calm hours or even minutes before the world changed are shown so objectively and impartially as if the filmmakers don't know themselves what's going to happen. And this lull is so frightening from today's perspective. Paul Greengrass made a great film which looks almost as a documentary and which derives much of its power from this fact. This is not a heroic, epic tale of survival and struggle, it's a quiet story about ordinary people who once woke up in hell and just like us refused to believe it all was true. But they had to fight to stay alive and these common people who were on the United 93 - managers, secretaries, sportsmen or whoever else were there - fought to stop this madness. Paul Greengrass took a viewer 5 years back and let him observe everything not from his armchair in front of the TV, but to actually BE there and to experience all the terror and anguish himself. And he succeeded indeed. There are no well-known actors in United 93 so that we can feel all the characters are real people just like us, one of the few familiar faces here is David Rasche, and we catch at him like people on the plane were grasping at him as at a straw because he (as a pilot) was their only hope to survive this nightmare. But although we hope till the very last minute that passangers will manage to win this fight, we are thrown into despair even deeper realizing we already know the outcome.

United 93 is an utterly powerful and impressive picture. Probably the best way to pay the tribute to all the people who lost their lives on 9/11. And Paul Greengrass, being a good director, understood he didn't need a blockbuster with Bruce Willis to do that. He just needed a small, modest movie that almost like a documentary showed us real people in extraordinary circumstances and made us feel at least a grain of what they must have felt that day. This movie is recommended to everyone with no exceptions for it's one of the most potent pictures you'll ever see.",1167177600,5,3284,4.37315875613748
1549872,5,B00005JOZI,"Even though I knew how the story was going to end, I still found it a gripping movie to watch. I was worried that it would try to put a human face to the terrorism of 9/11, a terrorism that has probably changed the world we live in forever but thankfully, that didn't happen. It's the story of a shocking series of events that literally came out of the clear blue sky but more importantly, it's the story of immense courage and heroism in the face of unthinkable adversity and quite rightly serves as a tribute to all those who lost their lives on the flight. This story needed to be told. And with the documentary-style directing and use of mostly unknown actors (with, I believe, some real-life participants), it all seems so very real. Director Paul Greengrass skillfully keeps the tension high right to the very end. Excellent stuff.

While, although quite the emotional roller coaster ride one would expect from something so close to our common psyche yet so far from our actual personal experience, the film is amazingly relevant, intuitive, objective and just damned GOOD! I could not bring myself to see this film after almost a year after its release. But I sure am glad to have seen it now - the heroism is portrayed honestly and not ridiculously glorified, while the ""other"" side is viewed with at least a modicum of objectivity (admittedly, it is difficult to understand the true motivations of such heinous actions, as the secular viewer may find such acts as justifiably  incomprehensible, as this reviewer did).

1549875,4,B00005JOZI,"This was emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever and I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film.

Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch, but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault, despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.

What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors.  And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.

And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful.

For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood trash, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.  I won't say this film is for everyone.  It IS hard to watch at times.  I do know that United 93 was done in a tasteful, respectful manner, and many of the families affected on 9/11 supported its release. Who are we to say otherwise? See the movie and then make your judgment call. You may find yourself surprised, just as I did.",1166227200,2,1767,4.641025641025641
1549876,5,B00005JOZI,"Excellent film. And when I ordered it, I really had NO idea how good this film was going to be since I didn't see it at the movie theater. It is one well-made movie and kept my interest all the way through. Excellent buy.",1166140800,2,221,4.045454545454546
1549877,3,B00005JOZI,"This film is extremely well performed with a documentary feeling.  The viewer genuinely feels as if they are present in the air-traffic control headquarters, on the plane, etc.  We feel the frustration of the military and the controllers, as well as the passengers.

This film is a weeper.  I believe it is impossible to view this film without a sense of loss as the passengers begin to sneak calls on their cell phones, calls that are reconstructed from interviews with loved ones, etc. as they say goodbye and confirm their love to those at home. There is the underlying knowledge that this is true.  While the action on the plane is speculative, the telephone conversations are real, perhaps too real.

I recommend this film with one caveat.. the film is dedicated to those who lose their lives on 9-11, but that would include the scum who hijacked the planes.  As a docu-drama, the film portrays the hijackers not as the monsters we know that they were, but as religious men, praying in the cockpit even as they plan to crash the plane.  In other words, it glorifies both the bravery of those who sought to stop the hijackers and the evil of the hijackers.

I have been known to get a tear in my eye while viewing films.  However, this film affected me deeply in a dark manner.  I sobbed terribly, and left the film with a sadness and sorrow over the loss of life.  Then, I became angered when the dedication at the end of the film came on-screen.  How dare the producers of this film include the slime who perpetrated this unprovoked act of terrorism in the dedication!!!",1166140800,2,1576,4.585714285714285
1549928,5,B00005JOZI,"In essence, this is a real-time war movie with minimal editorializing* and no detectable post-modern storytelling gimmicks. The movie that comes closest to it in spirit (to my mind) is ""Black Hawk Down"". Only the actions of adversaries are portrayed; motives are not explained. The movie's main objective is to try to answer: ""What happened aboard the plane?""

(*The only editorializing I could discern was the inclusion of a male character with a German-like accent urging the other passengers of 93 to just follow the hijackers' instructions.)

The DVD comes with insightful commentary by the director, particulary on the nature of organizational 'systems' and the snags in their attempts to communicate with each other expediently and process what is going on.

Those aboard United 93, he notes, were among the first people forced to answer the question, ""What do we do now?"" In a striking remark that draws a parallel between the battle for the cockpit of United 93 and the political maneuvering for ""the world's controls"" today, the director, in effect, asks, ""What do we do now?""",1165881600,2,1085,5.084269662921348
1549929,5,B00005JOZI,"I was working at a National Emergency Coordination Center on the morning of September 11th and had been on duty for an hour or two when news came that a ""light plane"" had hit the World Trade Center. As a low level technician, whose responsibilities included the main conference AV equipment, we turned on the giant screen in the main building and watched the smoke coming out of the tower on the 15 x 15 foot screen. At that moment, before the second plane hit and before anyone knew what was coming, it was all unbelievable and surreal. Who could have fathomed that men would use passenger planes to destroy so many innocent civilians? Who could have conceived what men were so willing to kill for?

I watched this movie on DVD. While watching the film, I had to stop and take breaks to gather my thoughts and break the stress, even before any of the ""violence"" or ""action"" began in the film. Watching the control centers' scrambling with the unknown and unthinkable was too much like real life. I can sympathize with these men and women working in confusion. It's easy to look back with 20/20 hindsight and say, ""They should have known."" But on that day, with nothing ever happening like this before in history, you have to understand - most of us had no idea. This event was not even a horrific scenario that most of us had ever dreamt of as an option. It was ludacris. A common reaction watching this film is probably viewers like me wanting to yell back in time, ""It's for real.""

""Art is the signature of civilizations."" - Beverly Sills. ""The role of art is to make a world which can be inhabited."" - William Saroyan. ""Art is the triumph over chaos."" - John Cheever. This film is a work of art. Hopefully, this film will bring more humane responses to the insane rationales men think up to hurt and kill one another.

There is a scene in the movie ""Sunshine,"" staring Ralph Fiennes, where 1500 men in a concentration camp watch and do nothing as one of the prisoners is beaten, hung from a tree naked, then very slowly frozen to death with water from a garden hose. One of the prisoners is later asked, ""Why did you do nothing when there were only 14 guards?""

I admire the passengers on flight United 93 who chose to fight, but who did NOT choose to be martyrs. They saw fellow passengers dying around them. They reasonably could see the hijackers were likely going to crash the plane into a building and take more lives. My guess is that if there would have been ANY other way to prevent the imminent harm, they would not have given up their lives. But when faced with the choices they had, they took the actions that might preserve their own life and almost assuredly would save many more lives. They did not want to harm or kill themselves in pursuit of a cause. They were FIGHTING TO LIVE, knowing their choice may lead to their deaths. And to fail to understand that distinction is to not give sufficient honor to their honorable choices and deaths.",1165363200,6,2961,4.477777777777778
1549930,5,B00005JOZI,"I put off seeing ""United 93"" for a long time, thinking it might be either sensational or self-pitying. But when I finally did sit down to watch this movie, I found it thoughtful and absorbing. British filmmaker Paul Greenberg wrote and directed ""United 93"" in a docudrama style that hasn't been employed this successfully in decades. He populated the film with real pilots, real flight attendants, real air traffic controllers, and real military professionals, some of them also actors, who lend authenticity to the recreations. The scenes in the air traffic control centers were filmed in real time, as the participants and actors reenacted the morning of September 11, 2001. Ben Sliney, who was in charge at the National Air Traffic Command Center that day, reprises his own role compellingly. The result is an extraordinary film that is at once riveting drama and an important contribution to the continually unfolding aftermath of 9/11.

""United 93"" recreates 1 hour and 51 minutes of the morning of September 11, 2001, much of it in real time -though the beginning of the film seems compressed, as passengers and flight crew arrive at the airport and board the plane. The action shifts between United Airlines Flight 93, the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, VA, the air traffic control towers in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, and the Northeast Air Defense Center (NORAD) in Rome, New York. The first hour gives us an inside look at air traffic and military professionals as they struggle to understand what is going on and implement some sort of response. The film demonstrates an acute awareness of the systems on which our modern world depend and the fragility that became apparent when a group of determined individuals decided to assault our modernity.

No one knows precisely what went on on United Flight 93. Paul Greenberg assumed the delicate job of creating ""a believable truth"" for an event that is deeply steeped in politics and mythology. Greenberg was up to the task, and ""United 93"" could not be better. Sensitive without melodrama, suspenseful instead of sensational, reflective but not passive, ""United 93"" fulfills the need to understand and memorialize the events of September 11, 2001, for the families of the deceased, for Americans of all political stripes, and for a culture that still struggles to put these events in context and to decipher their implications. That's a tall order, and I could not praise ""United 93"" more highly for delivering on it.

The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): In ""United 93: The Families and the Film"" (1 hour), some families of passengers who perished on United 93 talk about their loved ones and meet the actors who play their family members in the movie. ""Memorial Pages"" (text) are a list of the 30 passengers and crew who died on United Flight 93 with a bio of each. ""Twin Towers"" (2 min) is a promotion of a short documentary about 2 brothers, one policeman and one firefighter, who responded to the World Trade Center on 9/11. The audio commentary by Paul Greenberg is thoughtful and worthwhile, especially the first half. The second half is a bit repetitive. He talks about the film's structure, what he left out and why, technical challenges, and comments a great deal on the film's ideas. He unfortunately doesn't say which parts of the action on board Flight 93 is fact and what was extrapolated. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French, Spanish. DVS is available for the visually impaired.",1164931200,5,3539,4.954545454545454
1549931,5,B00005JOZI,"Ever since 9/11 I have tried to learn everything I can about that day, especially in regards to the events that took place and the people who were tragically taken from us. I believe that its important to know their names, where they came from, and who they were because we all need to know the loss in order to make sure it doesn't happen again, and their legacies live on in our perseverance. I thought it was time, 5 years after, to begin showing what happened either in TV or in films. The story of Flight 93, the plane that crashed in Shanksville Pennsylvania presumably on its way to hit the White House, is riveting because of the details of both its passengers and crew and the detective work it took to piece together all those details. The planes that hit the world trade centers and the pentagon gave us few glimpses as to what transpired onboard, we have very few first hand accounts to see into their last moments. There were two projects based on that day, this movie ""United 93"" put out by Universal and a TV movie called ""Flight 93"" which came on A&E 3 months before the theatrical release. I have watched both, and I prefer the A&E version over this one, now this one is well done and is visually stunning and hits you where it should, BUT the TV version in my opinion has the greatest impact emotionally, physically. United 93, tells more of the technical side, what was happening on the ground at the military and aviation centers, It does not go into the passengers and their personal struggles and their families heartache. On Flight 93 we see everything the technical, the military, the passengers, the hijackers, the families. Watching the people call their families, which is taken directly from records and interviews, broke my heart in two. Knowing these heroes through this glimpse into their final goodbyes, and seeing them rise up to confront the terrorists inspired me like no other movie ever has. United 93 didn't quite live up to that, I felt like they didn't show who these people were and what they were leaving behind. If I hadn't watched the other one, it would have been an amazing movie, I am still giving it 5 stars, it deserves it!",1164585600,2,2172,4.557544757033248

And lots of questions about this movie, and whether or not that it is too soon after Septemeber 11, 2001 for a film to be made of that horrible day in September of 01. I don't think so, and plus we have had a couple of other ones before this. Just months after the day, we had Gdon and Jules Naudet's 9/11, and Fahrenheit 9/11. And this movie got a R rating from the MPAA, and with very good reason to, so parents please don't let your kids watch this movie until they are old enough, this movie is not for them, and a lot in ths movie they should see, and don't count on a 9/11 film coming out that would even be appioate for them coming out in the future. Since this movie was released in September, tonight I finnaly got the chance to see it on dvd. This movie follows the story of United 93, that was the only hijacked airplanes on the morning of September 11, 2001 that didn't reach its target. Instead United Airlines 93 crashed into a Pennsylvania field. All the actors are unknown, and I would doubt a lot of htem you would have heard of. When this movie came out, and when I saw the full cast list, one of the names that I was surpised to see in the movie, and didn't see mentioned at all in reviews, is Cheyenne Jackson that played Mark Bingham. I know him best for being in the orginal Broadway cast of the Elvis Presley musical All Shook Up that opened up on Broadway on March 24, 2005, but because of decling tickets sales, lead the play to be closed on September 25, 2005. All the people that was on United 93 on that fateful September day died, and just by watching this film makes me glad that I wasn't on one of the 4 planes that day, otherwise I wouldn't be here writing this review. My life would have been lost, and who knows on the 3 other planes, how many people surived that day. And plus I can't even remember the last time I even had to take a plane ride. But still I have to give this a good review, and a recommendation, that if you haven't seen this film yet, that you might want to see this film, whether or not you knew a person that died on September 11th, certainly I have to be sad for the familes of September 11 victims, they didn't dereve to die this way, nor did thier loved ones derseved to lose them this way. I aslo like to reccomend 9/11 (2002), but I haven't seen Fahrenheit 9/11, so I can't tell you if it is even worth a watch.",1164499200,,2462,4.088842975206612
1549933,5,B00005JOZI,"Superbly crafted recreation of the morning of 9/11 covering all of the hijackings,  specifically detailing the doomed United flight 93 that will leave you gasping for air,  and maybe a Valium or two.  Not for fainters, those prone to anxiety attacks,  or the squeamish.  Absolutely NOT for children of any age. (this should have been an NC17)

The director puts you in the center of the emotional vortex inside the cabin,  the cockpit,  even the bathrooms on the plane.  You cannot say to yourself that this is just a movie,  given the events of that hellish day.  The editing is rocket fast,  deftly executed.  The acting,  all around,  is fantastic if a bit hysterical.  With all of the production values and skill combined in perfect concert,  this becomes from the very beginning,  a sweat-inducing, terrifying deathtrap of a movie.

The response of the military,  from the panic of the lower echelons,  to the complete absence of the higher-ups,  all the way to the ""president"", is shocking and pathetic.  No-one can make a decision,  and no-one is in charge.  The Keystone Cops would have been more effective.

As for the terrorists themselves,  the fanatic bastards are rightfully portrayed as merciless,  mindless killers that they are.  And remember that fanaticism in all of its forms,  whether it is Islamic,  Christian,  Jewish,  military, racial or whatever, it's all the same.  Fanatics all are equally dangerous.

Even though this is film is a brilliant history lesson and must be remembered in all its grisly brutality,  remember this material is not for everyone.  Personally,  I feel that should a religious Empire run by lunatics ever comes to pass,  and our government continues on our current path of incompetance and stupidity,  America is doomed.",1164412800,,1769,5.006944444444445
1549934,5,B00005JOZI,"Two Hollywood films dealing with the same day; Zero political slant. Hmmm ... says a lot. The stories inherent in the events of 9/11 speak for themselves. Even Hollywood has respect for that. Michael Moore, aside, of course.

I finally got to see United 93 last night ... on DVD. Recently, I saw World Trade Center on the big screen. No, I didn't cry as much during United 93 as I did during my viewing of WTC ... but it was no less an emotional experience.

Both films deal with relatively isolated mini-events within the whole of the terror & horror of the big story of 9-11-01.

United 93 is shot with handhelds - providing a very similar viewing experience to that of The Ambush scene in The Last of the Mohicans. Far from distracting, I found it a perfect tool used by the director [Paul Greengrass] to enable the viewer to be completely immersed. It created a sense of confusion, much like the actual participants must have been going through ... was the bomb real or fake; were the 2 pilots dead or just forced to the ground? It was very effective.

So, whether the scene was at an air traffic control tower, a military central command post, or on the plane itself, one felt the urgency to act and yet the inability to sometimes do so due to the ""fog of war"". I found myself wanting to shout out ... to change the course of events. It was frustrating. Just as it must have been for some of those participants. Not being able to act ... a plane disappears from radar, next thing you know CNN is showing a smoldering WTC tower.

Unlike many ""disaster"" movies, this one had no fluff; no lets-get-to-know-the-characters syrupy dialog. It all just happens before your eyes. Very quickly, too. Before you even realize it has started, the movie is over. The fastest 1 hour and 51 minutes of movie viewing I have ever witnessed.

Every American should see these two movies, the Twin Towers, if you will. Every American should reflect upon what they see. There was selfless, heroic action ... Particularly, when the screen finally goes black in United 93, we are reminded of the special gift those who perished on that flight gave to us all that day. They gave their lives, yes, but more importantly, they showed us the way. They came face to face with the enemy, they put any inherent differences aside, they acted ... together ... as one.

And, they won. Never forget.",1164240000,4,2368,4.531615925058548
1549935,2,B00005JOZI,"The last scene was stellar but tell me, is that all that matters?

United 93 has a clueless start (the airports, the staff, the government talks) and a great,great build up to a ""napoleon dynamite"" of a conclusion. It didn't sell consequence but tries to sell heroic significance which I can learn to respect. However, I must say, 9/11 was not a good day and it changed my world as much as it changed yours. United 93, even with a grizzling build up - failed to remotely emotivate me. It was emotionally impotent and quite a few strands (namely - the character build up, the understanding transferred to the audience) were strayed about.

The reason I had big expectations from this film is because the particular incident changed a lot of things about our planet. It changed the way we Asians are welcomed in the west (Security checks, dubious random checkings by authorities,etc) , 9/11 brought the world closer and made the minorities more recognizable, a sense of cold dread adulterated with friendly humanity from all sides - - all in all, fills the world today. I had difficulty understanding how exactly the staff realized that the plane had been hijacked. There were a few loopholes I can overlook but the film really disappointed me. The acting is good but the direction, I feel, should have been more subtle yet impacting.

Sorry, this film just didn't manage to move me.

1549936,4,B00005JOZI,"This film was touching and is one I think all Americans, well, put it this way.  Anyone who has a pride for the United States of America should own this piece of history.  The film was very in depth, and very detailed in the terrorists plot as well as actions our government was taking to protect us from these terrible people. On flight, the things i saw/heard were accurate as to what really happened, it was extrememly accurate.  Of course I knew the plane would crash, at times I was still hoping to myself these brave passengers would win back the fight.  In a way they did win, they saved MANY lives by being brave and taking a stand.

This is a movie however, not everyhting is good about it.  I sometimes got bored with all the gov't talk and the scenes where the movie was in the control centers and what not.  I sort of wish they would've showed more of the action parts.  The action parts are what make the movie, especially in this case, they are what makes the viewer more patriotic, just to see what terrible events went on 9/11.

Not only was I worried about reliving the horror of 9/11 in any form again, but I was squeamish about how it would be handled, perhaps especially by a director who was not from the US himself.  Would it be a ""Blame America"" affair?  A political affair in general, either of which, I believe, would have detracted from the story of that day itself, when we had no idea of the suffering the people aboard the four planes driven to the ground and those in the Pentagon and WTC were about to undergo?

Not only was I relieved, but I feel I've undergone a film class watching Mr. Greenglass' oeuvre, one on how to use the ordinary sounds and sights of what might occur on a simple business trip to show how these ordinary people went from living a normal life to taking an incredibly heroic action that might have saved many more lives

90, perhaps 95% of the film takes place in the body of the airplane, in the aisle.  The flight attendants (many played by actual flight attendants) play a large role.  Shots are taken down the aisle to show the terorists in first class, sometimes sitting quietly, sometimes nervous and sweating, sometimes arguing with each other in Arabic about when is the right time to strike; and up to show the other passengers in first and coach.  Except for two of the terrorists, and the flight attendants, Greenglass has chosen not to name the passengers.  If you know the story well you will be able to recognize Todd Beamer and possibly wildlife refuge supervisor Richard Guadagno by their dialogue with others, but that's about it.

Other scenes are limited to aircraft control and military centers, where immediately after we learn American Airlines 11 has been hijacked, it is clear no one, anywhere, is sure what to do, and who is in charge....and throughout the course of the film, military personnel never are sure they have permission to shoot anything down, even after all commercial airlines are grounded, even if they know an airline is being hijacked. To me, these scenes gave me more chills than anything occuring on the United flight.

The choice to use actual flight attendants, flight controllers, and military personell where possible enhanced understatement and lack of hyperdrama  and  worked beautifully.  The interaction, mood, and emotional intensity was high but believable on the ground and the sense of panic is palpable without being histrionic.

Of course, no one knows exactly what went on in that big aluminum tube; Greenglass extrapolated a lot between knowing passengers told loved ones during phone calls that they were going to storm the cockpit, and that the plane crashed into the ground, not into any American landmark.  So he used some artistic license to sketch what one presumes he likes about Americans, and why they chose this ending (after all, it was their choice) over several others.  One device is a German passenger who insists on a different way.  He is unceremoniously vetoed.

Not that this is a xenophobic or should be seen as ""America's way and America's way only"" film.  As noted above, one must squirm to see the lack of communication  between the various flight agencies, the military, and other branches of government.  Nor is the film anti-Muslim or anti-Arabic, or does it suggest in any way that all Muslims or Arabs are terrorists (although it doesn't shy away from portraying the terrorists themselves as murderers). It is simply a film which shows us what began as an ordinary day, where a handful of people, who happened to be Americans, encountered the face of evil, and how they dealt with it.  This scenario has happened in real life over and over in the Middle East, and now in London,  Madrid, and Beslan, and Moscow.  Tomorrow, who knows?  It could be Berlin, or Buenes Aires.  I think that might be part of Greengrass's point.",1163116800,3,3877,4.764970059880239

Or that grew up here. So just keep that in mind. And even though I won't be running to pop this movie on my DVD player any time soon I'm still glad I decided to purchase it.

That doesn't make it any easier to watch. Of course I knew going into the film that there would be no survivors but oh how I clung to the hope while watching that they would. Why? Because they were ordinary human beings just like you and me going about their daily lives never dreaming what was in store for them once that plane left the ground. That could have been any of us boarding that morning of September 11 on Flight 93. The fight these brave souls gave weren't just for themselves or their loved ones but for every one of us who believe in freedom.

1550006,4,B00005JOZI,"Everyone knew how this one would come out, but it was still one of the most emotionally wrenching movies I've ever seen.  The theater was absolutely silent as the story of the 4th hijacked plane on September 11 ended with a blackened screen as United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Schwenksville, PA.  The use of unknown actors (including some actual participants at the various air and defense command centers) along with admirable dramatic restraint (the famous ""let's roll"" is whispered) by the director combine to put the viewer right in the middle of the most infamous day in recent history.",1162598400,,610,4.912621359223301
1550007,5,B00005JOZI,"""United 93"" is a movie that stands above any film I have seen this year. It is brilliant in its structure (the movie is told in real time) and compassionate in its intent (director Paul Greengrass refused to make the film without the support of the families of the passengers and crew).

Those who argued last spring that it was ""too soon"" for a 9/11 movie were making their arguments based on psychological wounds that, for some, haven't healed. And that is unfortunate, as I found the film quite therapeutic. I have never (NEVER) sobbed so hard at a film.

But dont' get me wrong...the movie doesn't exploit, nor does it point any fingers or draw any conclusions. It simply watches events as they unfold. Greengrass' decision not to use mega-stars for this story was deliberate; as was the decision to keep away from the Hollywood formula of portraying the characters as people with histories and sappy backstories. What we know about the passengers of this doomed flight are what we would have known had we been sitting next to them: absolutely nothing, save for what they were wearing or how they styled their hair or what book they were reading.

And that is what makes the staggering horror of the final moments of this film so monumental. You are right there with these passengers as they fight the ultimate fight to overtake their hijackers. American Everymen emerging from the chaos of that unbelievable morning with courage and heroism.

Even five years later there are many who still exploit 9/11 for political gain or turn its history into popular myth. But not ""United 93."" This film is masterful and heartbreaking; sobering and vital. And it honors the memory of the passengers and crew...those wonderful, brave angels.",1162166400,5,1733,4.844594594594595
1550095,1,B00005JOZI,"Perhaps it's because I was an air traffic controller working at an ATC facility that was directly involved in the 9/11 incident, but this movie is an overall insult. First, I think that 5 years is way too soon to cash in on misery--the first movie about Pearl Harbor took 25 years to come to the big screen. I guess Paul Greengrass couldn't wait until the age of 80 to line his pockets or was afraid someone would beat him to it. Also, for the most part, the reenactment of what happened on flight 93 is about 50% speculation--this is a partially fact-based movie. As for its technical correctness, best I've seen but still a long way off from correct. One small example: I worked at Bradley Approach Control for 11 years of my career (you'll hear it mentioned at the start of the movie) and I have never heard Alaska Airlines fly in there. When I worked at Burbank Approach, they came in all the time, but never at Bradley! As for ""read my radio,"" I've never heard that phrase.

I think the 10% donated to the 9/11 fund was a lame attempt to mask what was nothing more than an attempt to cash in on a sensational event that Greengrass knew would draw box office attention. If he wanted to cleanse his conscience and make his production of this movie a true ""gift to humanity and the families of 9/11,"" he should have donated 100% of the net profits to the 9/11 fund and let pride be his paycheck.",1161648000,12,1397,4.352490421455939
1550096,5,B00005JOZI,"`World Trade Center' was, unfortunately, the first of the two 9/11 based films I was able to see this year.  I was so unimpressed with WTC (aside from Maggie Gyllenhaal's wonderful performance) that I almost (and I stress almost) forfeited watching this film.  I'm so glad I rethought that idea.  This has to be one of the most touching and emotionally nerve racking movies I've seen in recent years and is such a triumph for movie making in general.  A lot of people were distressed since it has only been five years since the horrible events that circle this film, but when done as tastefully and as honestly as `United 93' we should be able to look passed our bias and embrace it for the tribute it truly is.

Approaching the attack without bias was the one thing that truly impressed me about this film, for it showed both sides of the coin.  While yes, what was done was one of the most horrific acts our country has had to endure this film also gave us a look at the attackers who, while committing a horrible crime were not doing anything wrong in their own eyes.  There were many scenes that showed these men as they came close to their attack, the concern and the worry in their eyes, the panic.  They were scared, very scared.

I don't want that to sound as if I condone what they've done because I don't, I just appreciate the way this film honestly portrayed the `villains' sort-of-speak instead of making them appear heartless and confident they appeared scared and panic-ridden.  It's a very commendable thing on the part of Greengrass.  Another smart move was having the film star almost no recognizable faces, so when we are watching this film we feel as though we are watching life, not a movie.  We can't say ""oh Brad Pitt won't die"" or ""I just saw Kate Winslet talking to Oprah about how hard it was to film that scene""...all we can do is watch in horror as these unrecognizable faces deal with the unbelievable.  It's one of those movies, where even though you know the outcome your frustrated with everyone on board hoping they'll do something else, anything else to deliver a happy ending.

No, this is far from a feel good film.  It will make you cry, it will make you proud (proud that we have people around us who are selfless enough to try and save others) and it will make you pray that nothing like this ever happens again.  One of the greatest achievements in cinema this year, `United 93' is a must see film!",1161302400,9,2438,4.481900452488688

Flight 93 is a straitforward telling of the story behind the one plane that did not reach its target on 9/11. Of course, some of the movie has to be speculation, but none of the scenes stretch credulity.

It was both horrifing and fascinating to witness.  It put a human face on the tragedy, other than seeing and hearing news type coverage about it.  It was a throughly engaging film, and at times hard to watch.  I couldn't help but get teary eyed during certain parts, that whole experience was totally tragic and disturbing.  I hope this film can bring some kind of closure or recogintion to the families of the flight 93 victims. They are of course the most important factor of the film and the reason why it was made.

1550099,5,B00005JOZI,"This film is a testament to the indomitable human spirit, refusing to fear death, refusing to give up in the sight of brutal and terrible and senseless actions against them.

A Film of Bravery, ignorance, humanity, debauchery. It is also about what good people can accomplish, even at ultimate cost, when they are driven by a single purpose.

The event turned the tables on the crusades. Now it is the Arabs and Islamist fanatics that bring their convert or die mentality to western society.  These fanatics have never stopped fighting the crusades.  The word is split into a dichotomy of two worlds, black and white, or Good vs Evil, nothing in between. Either you believe in Allah, or you must be put to dealth.  It reveiled the darkness that sorrounds ignorant racist and religious fanatacism and the ultimate price that humanity must pay for not giving proper consideration to historical perspective.

Much of the power of United 93 is the knowledge that there but for the grace of g-d, we were spared from this tradegy. This film allows you to experience first hand cockpit view of the world turned upside down.

How the jihadists had sacrificed their claim to legitamacy by their complete disrespect for life and the senseless murder of blameless souls who were butchered on Sept 11th.

It also sheds light on the very real possibility that you may be on the next hijacked jet that could be shot down by our government to prevent another tradegy.

Prior to watching this film, I was concerned about losing my control to the greif and horrible actions experienced.  I was amazed to find the exact opposite.  It made me proud to be part of the human race.  Not one victim lost their care and concern for those around them.  I was proud of the people wo would not give in to the terrorists.  We will never give them what they want.  We are americans, come from parents that suffered great adversity and sacrifice to get us where we are today.

""flight"" was more about the all around story,while ""united"" is more about the air traffic controlers and the passangers. paul greengrass has done a wonderful job,much like ron howard did with ""apollo 13"", in taking a story that we already know the outcome of and still keep you glued to the seat. with actors that are not that well known he has given this movie the feeling of really being there. the film reminds me of ""das boot"" the world war II movie about german subs,because the camera is confined to the small set of the plane and you feel the closeness of the walls. this isn't some big hollywood action movie with bruce or arnold,no one lone hero here,just 40 people scared to death but not willing to give up or to let others die if it could be stopped. this is an emotional and deeply moving movie of 40 people who did what we all hope we never have to do,they gave their lives to save 100's maybe 1000's of lives. when it's all over this is a very moving tribute to those men and women. it will remain to tell their story of courge long after we who remember pass away! they familes of these hero's should be proud of these peopl;e",1160697600,,2101,4.38974358974359

It was an ordinary day, she had no reason to cry
As you walked out the door,
You softly wiped tears from her eyes
When you left, she felt empty somehow, she did not know why

You called her in horror, with tears in your eyes
You told her planes had struck the twin towers
People were dying and you did not know
if you would come home
She started to scream, her worse nightmare now real
as she heard how these terrorists from Iraq
Died for religion alone.

Tears now were washing her eyes
Will there ever be peace again
Will there only be smoke filled skies
Or will the air clear
So all can see the horizon
And find freedom from this fear

She was so calm when she heard the news
Her husband high-jacked
His last words
'Let's roll em'
She heard how all the passengers
Said The Lord's Prayer, as friend to friend
They stood in a circle
Going to their death
To reach heaven
Led by one great hockey player to the end.

And his precious wife, tears washing her eyes
Remembered only a few hours before
How her husband touched her with his hands
The sadness had begun,
Yet, he died a brave man,
On September eleven, two thousand and one.

Let us all remember
Those brave men of our land,
The women and children
Who died for freedom and the American flag

1550102,5,B00005JOZI,"Some of you may have read my early reviews for ""World Trade Center,"" and therefore may be surprised to find me singing high praise of Paul Greengrass and his film ""United 93.""  And I do use the word 'film' on purpose, because this heartwrenching, moving, true story is not a movie, it is a film, and there IS a difference.  We go into ""United 93"" much like ""World Trade Center,"" in that we already know the outcome of the events in the film.  In fact, we pretty much know everything that is about to take place, including the specific phone conversations held by passengers and the small crew onboard.  But we could not prepare for the emotions that will wrack us within the almost two hour film span.

I am a native NYer and a filmmaker, two things which make me inherently cynical to a lot of movies about 9/11 and have me running for the History Channel and National Geographic Documentaries.  However, ""United 93"" touched a different side of me because it takes us inside the minds, hearts, and emotions of those onboard the flight in a way no other fictional depiction has yet to do.  We all can close our eyes and see the planes hit the buildings-- whether we were in lower Manhattan or Washington or just saw the coverage moments later on television-- but we can only imagine the fear inside the cabin of United 93.  Until now.

And while I found myself staring at the screen, awaiting the inevitable final moments-- of the film and of the passengers' lives-- a little part of me still held onto that Hollywood lens hope: that while we watched hands fight each other and intertwine for control-- hands that in the chaos could not be told apart from each other, hands of hijackers and passengers alike-- miraculously a pair of hands would grab ahold of steering device and pull that plane up even as the fields grew larger through the cockpit windshield.  This film affects the viewers that much.",1160438400,3,1902,4.567647058823529
1550103,5,B00005JOZI,what i got from UNITED 93 is...TO DO NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION FOR THE WESTERN WORLD.  the people on united 93 are an inspiration and i am so thankful to them for fighting the sons of the devil terrorist.,1160352000,,203,4.075
1550104,5,B00005JOZI,"When I sat down to watch the DVD of ""United 93"" I knew it was going to be a very good movie (based on other reviews I'd heard about the film and hearing people talking about it) -- but I was somewhat unprepared for the large emotional impact it was going to make. (And a physical impact as well; I was practically sweating bullets by the end of this movie.)

""United 93"", written and directed with flawlessly-executed craftsmanship by Paul Greengrass, is easily the most powerful, the most riveting, and the most gut-wrenching film I have ever watched in my lifetime. And I cannot imagine it being topped in those categories for quite some time (if ever).

In what seems very nearly a literal way, Director Greengrass has succeeded in placing every member of the audience on board that San Francisco-bound United Airlines Boeing 757-200 (N591UA), which represented Flight #93 on the sunny morning of September 11, 2001.

Every single frame of film that went through Mr. Greengrass' camera while photographing this motion picture has a ""genuine"" feel to it. It is so eerily realistic, it's almost impossible not to have your hands shaking while watching this entire movie. I felt like I was among the passengers who were trying desperately to crash into that cockpit and overtake the terrorist hijackers.

The actors that the producers hired to portray the 40 passengers and crew members are each to be applauded separately (and collectively), in my personal opinion, for their realistic and spot-on performances in this movie. It's really hard to describe how good this whole cast is. All of the performances from the men and women who share this cast roster will move you to tears. The terror on board that aircraft is so real during this movie, it's nothing short of awe-inspiring.

I'm finding it difficult typing this review, after just now having watched the film for the very first time, and having been transfixed by the impeccable way that Mr. Greengrass has brought this horrifying true story to the big screen in a thoroughly respectful, non-exaggerated, and non-exploitative manner.

This movie is hard to watch, that is for sure. Knowing that the brutal things we're seeing unfold on the screen actually (and incredibly) did take place above the eastern United States on 9/11/01 is enough to make your head swim, and to literally take your breath away at times too. I found myself having to breathe deeply many times just to make it through the intense scenes of stark terror.

It's difficult to watch, yes....but it's also impossible NOT to keep watching this remarkable motion picture once you've taken a look at just the first few minutes.

And as far as being technically well-made....this film is probably second to none as far as the subject of ""aviation"" is concerned. I've seen quite a few movies centering on the subject of airplanes and aviation, but ""United 93"" is by far the most ""technically accurate"" movie I have ever seen from the standpoint of realistic airplane footage.

In the many scenes that take place aboard the plane which represents the Boeing 757 twin-jet airliner that plunged into a Pennsylvania field at more than 500 MPH at 10:03 AM on September 11th, I felt as if I was watching a real-life hijacking unfold inside the cabin and flight deck of a 757 in flight. The way the plane moves, the way the sky looks outside the cabin windows, the view from the cockpit....everything was absolutely perfect....and extremely realistic-looking. It's as if Mr. Greengrass was somehow able to actually film the hijacking in progress on 9/11. Just incredible.

------------------

In addition to providing a sparkling Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) print of ""United 93"", the 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD set from Universal Studios offers up some nice bonus supplements too, including......

1.) A director's Audio Commentary track with Paul Greengrass.

2.) ""Chasing Planes: Witnesses To 9/11"" -- A 48-minute documentary/featurette (only available on the Limited Edition DVD). This is a program focusing on the military and the air-traffic controllers and their response to the national emergency on 9/11.

Ben Sliney of the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, is featured prominently throughout this well-done bonus documentary. Sliney, who was the National Operations Manager for the FAA on 9/11, plays himself in ""United 93"" (in what is a fairly big part), and he's excellent in the film too.

Incredibly, September 11, 2001, was Mr. Sliney's very first day on the job as the FAA's National Operations Manager. He was the man who initially gave the order to halt all U.S. air traffic at approximately 9:45 A.M. (ET) on 9/11, just a few minutes after American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.

""Chasing Planes"" also features a unique high-angle video clip of United Flight 175 approaching and hitting the south tower of the World Trade Center. It's footage of that horrible moment in history that was taken from an angle that I had previously never seen before.

By the way, the ""Chasing Planes"" documentary on Disc #2 of the ""LE"" DVD is shown in Anamorphic Widescreen, even though the packaging incorrectly indicates ""Full Frame 1.33:1"".

3.) ""United 93: The Families And The Film"" -- A very good 60-minute documentary centering on the families of several of the victims of Flight 93. (Anamorphic Widescreen; approx. 1.85:1.)

4.) Memorial Pages (text biographies for all 40 victims of Flight 93).

5.) A two-minute trailer for the 2003 short film ""Twin Towers"".

------------------

""United 93"" is a movie that every American should take time out to watch. It's a slice of an American tragedy that will never be forgotten; and Mr. Paul Greengrass has made a truly phenomenal motion picture here. This film gets the highest possible recommendation from this writer. Experience it for yourself and you'll see what I mean.

It also depicts the confusion at Air Traffic Control and in the military as the unexpected happens moment by moment. The movie carries a powerful impact and stirs emotions both poignant and uplifting. It's a movie well done.",1160006400,,475,4.734939759036145
1550178,5,B00005JOZI,"Rarely have I ever had actual goosebumps from a film. This one gave them to me twice. For all who know the story (and that should be everyone at this point) these are not spoilers. But if you some how managed to miss one of the biggest news stories of the century, then do not read on unless you don't mind a few spoilers. For the first time since that terrible day, September 11, 2001, seeing the actual footage of the second plane hit the tower gave me an instant chill down my spine and the goosbumps I mentioned before. The second time was seeing the passengers making their calls to loved ones, some realizing it would probably be the end and remaining calm, while others were quite distraught and understandably so.

This film was so dramatic and well written, that I truly did feel like I was on Flight 93, in the Control Towers and at the military post. This is in part because it was filmed in real time and also due to the fact that nothing was played over the top. When chaos reigned, we saw it. When things were calm and mundane, we saw that too. Military command even played out as real as it can get without being there. The hijackers weren't portrayed as anything other than what they were. I commend everyone involved with this picture for sticking with the truth. Every school should show this film to their students and include it in the discussion of the events surrounding 9/11/01, it is that accurate and that good.",1159833600,4,1436,4.4393939393939394
1550179,5,B00005JOZI,"This movie was very well done, in taste and class.  Very respectful to the families.  It's a flashback of when I turned on the news and sat there in absolute shock when the trade center was hit.  I think most people remembered 9/11 as being when the twin towers went down and not so much the flight 93 whose passengers and crew saved God knows how many people by re-directing the plane.  Kudos for the downgraded ""Hollywood"" portrayal also.  The most touching addition to this movie is the bonus feature where the castmembers meet the families of the person they played.  I got pretty choked up watching that.

I definitely recommend everyone at least see this movie.  The people on that plane deserve that much from us.",1159660800,3,720,4.6141732283464565
1550180,4,B00005JOZI,"Because this is such a sensitive subject matter, and because all involved in the project stated that the story would be portrayed with dignity, one tends to scrutinize every scene for signs of melodrama and inaccuracies. I watched FLIGHT 93 first (a couple of months ago), and was VERY impressed with what they did and how events were portrayed in that A&E movie. To tell you the truth, certain details were explained much BETTER in that movie than in this one. Just shows you a story can be told successfully in more than one way! But there were some moments in the TV-movie where I felt they veered very close to cheap sentimentality, especially when Titanic-esk panpipes could be heard on the soundtrack. UNITED 93 uses very little music, which I appreciated .I found UNITED 93 just as engrossing and ultimately more sad than FLIGHT 93. My only reference to a situation remotely like this was when we flew through a storm once and I remember how quiet it was. No one said a word and we all stared at each other with pale faces and wide eyes.
 I would recommend watching both movies (not on the same day!) as that will paint the full picture of what happened that terrible morning in 2001. Also, the extras on the UNITED 93 dvd are great, with insightful commentary by Paul Greengrass and a very emotional documentary about the families meeting the castmembers. Not a dry eye in my house. Ultimately we have to admit that while we watch UNITED 93, we constantly place ourselves in the situation of those passengers and wonder how WE would have reacted and acted, had that grave destiny been ours.",1159660800,,1598,4.626760563380282

1550182,4,B00005JOZI,"This could be the toughest review I've ever written. Being a born-and-bred American, I have a few protective sensibilities regarding my home country. When 9/11 happened, I was just as stunned, fearful, and outraged as most of my fellow countrymen, I'm sure. And watching a film related to those events only a few short years after that dreadful day, I could feel those same emotions smoldering within me. Trying to objectively rate this film based solely on its merits becomes a bit sticky, simply because that emotional scar is still so fresh. But I'll do my best.

The greatest thing about UNITED 93 is that it's filmed using hand-held cameras, giving the viewer an intimate sense that they are an active party within the movie. This is most effective when we're on the plane (for reasons stated earlier) and get to witness all of the passengers' interactions with each other and the hijackers. The other excellent part is that there isn't one star that we follow, nor are there any big name actors/actresses in the film. Every person is just as important as the next. I applaud director Greengrass' script interpretation and this seldom used method of filming.

Another admirable item is that the film shows us how off-guard the FAA and the military was immediately following the hijackings. As the movie moves between the FAA headquarters and the military's interactions with these public offices, we get to witness the incredible chaos that ensued and feel the frustrations as they try to figure out which planes are risks, what to do about them, who has the authority to shoot them down (if need be), and the unavailability of President Bush.

The big issues with the movie will obviously be very personal. Each individual will probably feel differently about it. Mine were of manipulation. Since this is still a fresh memory in the minds of most Americans (including my own), I felt as though the film makers were trying to feed off of those memories. This isn't as horrible as it sounds, though. Some of the best films play with our feelings. The risk here, however, is what we do with them. Do we continue to fear? Or hate? Or do we learn from these experiences and move ahead? This film won't give you the answers to those questions, which is both a strength and one hell of a flaw. But it is a well put together piece of cinema.",1159228800,2,2339,4.713936430317848
1550183,4,B00005JOZI,"A very respectful and intense depiction of what happened (or what probably happened) on board Flight 93.  The director, along with many actors and non-actors, sans makeup, have done a commendable job recreating a horrifying incident, in a manner that does great justice to the realist school of filmmaking.  Though many people have suggested it was ""too soon"" to tell this tale cinematically, I am thankful that this was made by people for whom 9/11 was still a recent horror -- this will make it an important film for future generations who wish to understand what people went through that day, a story told by the 9/11 generation.

Yes, it is difficult viewing.  Yes, it is scary.  Yes, it is disturbing.  But is it worth watching?  Yes, it is.  Watch it with a friend.  Talk about it.  And be thankful for the gift of life.",1159056000,4,826,4.63448275862069
1550184,5,B00005JOZI,"It is a tough watch from the very beginning because we know what will happen in the next two hours of the film. `United 93' is still a film that deserves praise not only because of its subject matter, but because of the way it treats it on the screen. It is certain that this is not a film that you can casually watch; some people would never watch it (and I don't blame them for it). But if you're still wondering, all I can say is ""If not now, when?""

Director Paul Greengrass's semi-documentary style with a shaky camera captures the intense atmosphere of the places. `United 93' unfolds on two levels simultaneously - both in the hijacked plane, and in the controlling room on the ground one after the other. The confusion and tension can be of course re-created in books or documentary films, but Greengrass who four years before made terrific `Bloody Sunday' based on the 1972 Irish Civil Right march and its subsequent events, knows the power of cinema, or how films can have us relate to the people in it.

I must write about two things here before ending my review. Some say the detailed accounts of the incidents depicted in `United 93,' especially those on the airplane and her crew and passengers, are not entirely based on the confirmed facts. True, and God only knows what happened on United 93, or whether or not the passengers succeeded in breaking into the cockpit. But I can also say that the film is much more convincing and even truthful than those  conspiracy theories about 9/11.

There has been discussion on whether or not the film is exploitation. Honestly, I don't know. But is there any other way of recording and presenting this tragedy without being `exploitive'? Or should we wait another 50 years or more to film it while we know it is about the present time and us? Ultimately it comes to this question: ""If not now, when?""

Always being somber, `United 93' refuses to be sensational - all the more reason for the film to be challenging and gut-wrenching.",1158883200,6,1987,4.585915492957747
1550185,5,B00005JOZI,"Director Paul Greengrass has accomplished the difficult task of making what will possibly be the definitive filmed version of the unthinkable events surrounding Flight United 93 on September 11, 2001.

United 93 does not offer analysis or explanation. The movie just lives inside those astonished 90 minutes of horror between one moment and the next one.

The film takes place in virtual real time, cutting among the events on-board United Flight 93, which was the only plane of the four hijacked that morning not to reach its target, and the escalating confusion on the ground. As much as 9/11 was a worldwide televised event, Greengrass manages to evoke new horrors by taking us inside the confusion, showing us how the scenario was slowly put together by those who were in a position to do something about it.

There is a masochistic quality to watching the film, as we enter the theater knowing fully well aware of the horrors we are about to witness. For we all know, or think we know, how the story of United 93 comes out.

But what happens at the end of the story? Greengrass evidently disagrees with Bush's implications that the passengers committed an act of self-immolation. In the director's vision, the passengers have a naive idea of using a passenger, a trained pilot, to bring the plane down to the ground. But it's clear that Greengrass's refuses to confirm that without the passengers' action they would have hit the Capitol. On the contrary, his script shows the terrorists making a miscalculation of their own.

The film develops slowly, beginning in the early morning hours as the four hijackers prepare themselves for what they feel it's their duty. We get images of Newark airport, the passengers, unaware that they future does not behold a happy ending. The air traffic controllers, several of whom are portrayed by their real-life counterparts, are going about their everyday business until the horror shows in their screens.

From there, the film escalates as we know it did, until Greengrass finally abandons the world on the ground and concentrates the film's final moments entirely on the plane. It is here that Greengrass's amazing restraint and respect shows up, as he presents the victims as a group of terrified people facing a certain death making a desperate decision to change their own fate. There are no goofy-corny subplots and made up characters. There is no sense of heroism or national duty, but rather the jittery, horrifying sense of seeing your own death approaching. It's hard, it's sad and overwhelming, but still, it's something that we should see, so we never forget the horrors those innocent human beings were exposed without any justification.",1158796800,5,2694,4.975555555555555

Although many brought up what was perceived as the incompentencies of the authorities on that day, the truth is much more shattering.  The days of aircraft carriers, smart bombs, practiced military manuvers, and conventional war are long past.

This movie portrays the truth.  Few could have forseen this.

It was born in the Iranian Revolution in the late '70's.  As we fight the enemy on many fronts today, few have the guts to say that we, in actality, are fighting a sinister IDEOLOGY!  That was portrayed in this film by airline passengers praying the Lord's Prayer while the scumbags in the cockpit were also ""Praying"" to their ""God"" for success in killing thousands!

This movie should be a ""must see"" for all high school students to WAKE THEM UP to the 21'st century's urgent threat.  The days of complacency are over.  THe days of denial should be over!  Bin Laden and the Iranians are repeating that this is World War 3!  Until we treat it as such and DO what is neccesary, instead of squandering men and material against the wrong enemy, the very core of civilization hangs in the balance!

1550217,5,B00005JOZI,"I rented this last night and found it very rewarding. If one were to sit through all of the existing footage and primary source material on the WTC attacks it would probably take a decade to watch it all. We've all witnessed the fate of the people in the first two planes, the firefighters, the hopeless victims trapped on the upper floors many times over. For that reason, I will never watch a fictionalized version of anything related to the WTC. There is simply no need.

The story of those aboard United 93 has largely been overshadowed because there are no witnesses or videotapes. Actual audio has been withheld, misguidedly in my opinion, by the government. So I thought this film would be the closest thing to a factual portrayal I was going to get. And that is exactly the case. The viewer is given the opportunity to experience what the passengers experienced without a lot of emotionally manipulative moviemaking techniques. It's ordinary people on an ordinary flight.

I did feel a rush of pride during the ""final charge"" and that is the best memorial that could be given to these brave people. I found myself hoping they could still pull it off, even though that was obviously impossible. I got the impression from the film that the passengers got pretty close to actually taking back control of the plane. And it is suggested that had they done so, there were a couple passengers capable of operating the plane. Another two minutes and who knows? Maybe they all would have been awarded medals instead of being memorialized.

Regardless, they accomplished a great deal in saving countless lives of others and demonstrated the best of humanity in the darkest circumstances imaginable.",1158451200,4,1696,4.841379310344828
1550218,5,B00005JOZI,"Okay, It's been 5 years since 9/11. And the question comes to our mind whether it is time to do a movie about the attacks or not. In my opinion it is time, people are trying to put the thought of what happened so far back as if it never happened, and I understand the least we want to do is remember that tragic event, but we shouldn't remember it just for the tragedy but also for the day that we all stood up as one. Stood up united. And that's exactly what this movie does. Instead of making it a usual Hollywood movie, director Paul Green grass has managed to deliver something more human, entirely shot in a documentary style. This type of movie should be seen by everyone, and as I said not for the tragedy that occurred to the passengers, but for the historical aspect, and to make us remember that this is a country that stands united, and that we will fight to the last.

1550219,5,B00005JOZI,"""United 93"" is one of the most moving pictures I've ever seen.  It is a near real-time account of what happened on the doomed United flight that was headed for San Francisco but ended up in a field in Pennsylvania when its passengers overpowered the cowards who intended to use it to hit our nation's capitol.  It opens with the cowards preparing for their mission.  We are then given the seemingly mundane but all-important events of preparing a flight for take-off.  We get very brief glimpses at the lives of the pilot, co-pilot, and the steward staff.  We learn that some of them have children, some of them have been to London, and others are looking forward to a little time off.  We get hints at the lives of the passengers as well.  Some of the have dealings with Sony, some of them are going to meet family, others are planning a visit to Yosemite.  All of these things seem so simple, so ""average,"" but the viewer realizes that none of these normal, everyday events will never come to fruition due to the actions of a few others on board the flight.

We also learn of the chaos that tears air traffic controllers apart as they try to determine the fate of a multitude of hijacked and possibly hijacked flights.  Who or what hit the Towers?  Where are those three other planes headed?  Why can't we get airspace clearance from the FAA.  Should we ground an entire nation's flight schedule?  Why is their no response from American 11?

This is simply a moving film.  I almost didn't want to watch it because I didn't know how I'd react.  I'll admit that I cried a lot.  I was also very, very angered by the actions of the cowards on the flight.  Yet in the end I was glad to have watched this film.  It showed just how strong the American spirit can be.  Even though the brave souls on United 93 were well aware of their impending fates, they came together to save the lives of so many others.

This single-disc edition provides a trailer for ""Twin Towers"" and an hour-long documentary with interviews of surviving family members of the heroes on Flight 93.  It also has a memorial with a brief biography of all of the heroes who perished defending their country and their fellow man.  Each biography is written by a family member or dear friend.

This film will make you cry.  It will make you angry.  It will also make you proud.  You'll be proud that no matter what our enemies throw at us, we as Americans can and will find a way to defeat them.  Naysayers cannot deny the bravery displayed on United 93, nor can they erase the horrible events of September 11, 2001 from our memory, try as they might.",1158278400,4,2613,4.442105263157894
1550220,5,B00005JOZI,"I hesitated to go see this in the theatre. It seems like I spend half my life on airplanes and in airports, and it was easier to credit the Flight 93 passengers for what they did -- which was the definition of courage -- without thinking too much about what it might have been like. Part of me was worried about what Hollywood might do to embellish the truth. You just cannot add anything -- SHOULD not add anything.

I finally rented it and I don't think I've ever been so immersed in a film. Even knowing the ending, watching the mundane airport scenes unfold put my stomach in knots. Watching the planes disappear on radar as they hit the World Trade Center, just quietly fading from the screen, is otherwordly. There's a sense of powerlessness and anger throughout the film, especially in the air traffic control scenes. It feels very real time, and in a way it gives us a chance to sort through the feelings that we had on that day. I couldn't move when I was watching it.

The realism of the film, and the pacing, make it extraordinary. Thankfully, we're spared the gratuitous gore and melodrama that studios serve up in seemingly every other film. This is disturbing, but very respectful.

I don't know if I would watch it more than once. United 93 is an outstanding film, and the final moments will fill you with incredible pride in, and respect for, the passengers and crew.

But the reality of it makes it hard to regard as entertainment, and in fact you can't watch it passively. It's part of all of us, and we're not watching a bunch of movie stars. Any of us could have been there. You can't escape that nagging feeling, and that makes United 93 positively frightening.

The film forces you to look inside yourself. What would I have done? What would you have done? How would you have used your final phone call in a plunging airplane?

I think everyone should see this film once. That's enough to stay with you forever.

I echo the reviewer's sentiment in hoping that the families of the passengers who fought back on United 93 regard this as a tribute to their heroism. I am in awe of their bravery.",1158192000,5,2114,4.475324675324675
1550221,5,B00005JOZI,"This film is superb and is done most tastefully!! The usual gamut of Hollywood special effects was not needed to get the message across that this film intends to portray to the viewer. Also, the producers chose not to center on the blood and gore so common with most films these days! The story had enough within itself to provide all that was necessary.

Secondly, no well-known actors were used in its production which makes the film even more realistic...The cast could have been the actual ones who boarded United 93 on 9/11.

I went to the theatre to see this film when it was first released...Even though it was intense to say the least, the full impact of this production really didn't hit home until I bought the DVD and watched it half a dozen times...It had a certain magnetism that kept drawing me to search for more that I may have missed the time before!

Although it didn't seem to do well at the box office, it will probably not be recognized for its true worth as is true with most things of value as compared to more well known productions! But make no mistake, this is one of the best films on the 9/11 attacks that you will ever see.

Since there were no survivors, no one really knows verbatim what actually happened aboard United 93 that day...Everything we do know for sure was portrayed in an accurate and tasteful manner. However, much of what we never will know had to be fictionalized to give the story the needed glue to reach its completion.

I wanted to see this film not for its entertainment value as with most movies, but for its historical aspects and also it's a way WE the viewer can share just a very small portion of what those heroes onboard must have felt, not to mention the families left behind, who ponder on through a life that is missing a large part of the heart and soul that they once knew.

I wish to thank the producers, actors and everyone who made this film possible...It is a fitting tribute to ALL those who perished on 9/11!!",1158192000,2,1979,4.43801652892562

If not for their bravery and courage, the plane, undoubtedly, would have reached it's target (either the White House or Congress) on that dreadful day which America was under attack.

The movie is an incredible depiction of what transpired that morning on United 93.  The choreography of the movie was remarkably done.  The casting of the characters couldn't have been better.  The time frame of the movie was perfect - not too long, not too short.

One of my favorite parts about this DVD is the Bonus Feature - where the characters meet the actual family members of the individuals they are playing in the movie.  It is heartwrenching but heartwarming at the same time, to see the flood of emotions when the family members meet the actors/actresses who play their beloved ones.

However, United 93 seemed to be a bit more factual. I liked the fact that it wasn't supposed to look like actors, but rather, people just going about their every day lives. Some of the people stumble in their lines, but i think that's great, because people don't normally talk 100% perfectly every waking minute!

The group was planning on taking out the White House in a series of terroist attacks that befalled our nation on September 11th. Paul Greengrass tries not to make the film political in anyway. He doesn't bash anyone. He showcases the people that sacrificed their live to save other people. It is a truly outstanding film that had me in tears when I was done watching it. It was a emotional masterpice that held onto you, and didn't let you go to till the end, although you knew what was going to happen, you still wanted the people to live.

1550307,3,B00005JOZI,"I must admit I was disappointed with UNITED 93.  I think the tv movie FLIGHT 93 captured the passengers' plight more than this bigger budgeted one.  While excruciatingly hard and sad to watch, UNITED 93 didn't make me feel as connected with the passengers and crew as I would have liked.  While FLIGHT 93 gave us the names of the passengers, Paul Greengrass' script makes them too anonymous, and I felt too much time was spent on the ground crew and even on the terrorists themselves.

I was disappointed even insulted by John Powell's eastern-tinged musical score; I was disappointed and even insulted with the juxtaposition of the passenger's recital of the Lord's Prayer with the terrorists prayers to Allah.  While I support everyone's right for religious expression, I can't find any reason to sanitize or empathize with the actions of these men who were responsible for the horrifying deaths of so many innocent American people.  I don't think this film is as strong a tribute to those brave passengers and crew as I would have liked, and that is rather sad.",1158019200,4,1064,4.818681318681318
1550308,5,B00005JOZI,"When I hear that Hollywood is going to do a film based on real-life tragedy, I usually cringe.  I guess this is because, more often than not, the subject matter gets what's now called the ""inspired by actual events,"" or what I call ""movie of the week"" treatment.  It doesn't matter if the film is actually meant for television or is getting the big-screen format, the way producers feel they have to handle such things is non-offensive and by-the-numbers; there are a handful of courageous people led by one hero who, in the face of all odds, triumph over evil or disaster, even if that's not what actually happened.  The villains are unsympathetic and we're rooting for them to get the axe at the end.

Thankfully, Paul Greengrass didn't allow this fact-based memorial to fall into that trap.  We don't see big-name actors portraying the people who died on United Flight 93.  Some of them are familiar faces, sure, but we've seen them all doing character pieces.  They, in fact, add to the idea that these were all common folk put into a harrowing situation that has absolutely no chance for a happy outcome.  We don't see salvation on the ground either, as the real people who manned control towers and Washington monitoring agencies on September 11, 2001, relive what, for them, was a moment of defeat - noone ever pictured a terrorist suicide mission on American soil, therefore noone had any idea how to handle it.  Certainly they did their best, but it wasn't good enough.

All of this could have made for an ultimately senseless work with no redeeming qualities, but there is a quote that goes something like, ""when all that is left is death, how you face it is what matters.""  Once the passengers on the doomed flight realized how big the stakes were, they decided to fight back.  What we're left with is a factual charge-of-the-Light-Brigade based on flight voice and data recorders showing how desperately both sides fought for victory.  And yes, the hijackers were deluded murderers, but we feel a slight bit of empathy for them.  They thought was they were doing was right, and in the end, they didn't want to die either.  If there was a way out for them with what their leaders harped on them was ""honor,"" I get the feeling they would've taken it.

Most of ""United 93"" is conjecture, but I feel it's educated conjecture.  It's hard to watch, but it does give all who died that day their due.  That's the important thing.",1158019200,2,2433,4.65807962529274
1550309,5,B00005JOZI,"It really is not too soon for this film, as some have suggested. People are still trying to find meaning for 9-11, and though this film does not answer many questions, it does, in its final moments, find focus and release for the pent-up emotions of the past five years regarding this event.

The genius of ""United 93"" is in the choice to go with a cinema-verite style, instead of a pathetically romantic hero-action flick style, as is ""World Trade Center"", which came across to me as ""9-11 For Dummies"". In ""United 93"" there is truth. There are no action-flick cliches; no heroic fanfares; no character introductions. The relatively unknown actors do not stand around reciting cleverly written dialogue -- most of the talking overlaps as in a Robert Altman film. Indeed, the government-plundered line ""Let's roll"" is almost whispered as an aside, along ""C'mon already...let's do it,"" which is probably more like how it really happened. The line is not used to sell a point, (or a war, for that matter).

As many others have said, this film will have your stomach in knots from the get-go. The viewer is forced to sit and watch, helpless, knowing what's to come while the cast appear as deer in headlights. The emotions of the passengers is often hard to take; I was literally moved to sobs by the goodbye phonecall made by the head stewardess, even though half of what she says is unintelligible; this film works that well on such a raw emotional level. The men do not posture themselves as cliched heros. Most are near-speechless, and all have tears in their eyes.

Then there is the final violence, which provides the only moment of release in the film. Plans are made; there is a brief pause, then the passengers suddenly rise with a barbaric ""yawp"" that is exhilarating, despite its ultimate futility.

This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.",1157932800,7,1865,4.729230769230769
1550310,5,B00005JOZI,"Why do I think so?

There's no Jack Nicholson, no Spielberg, no Peter Jackson, but what it does have is an incredible attention to detail and realism that will have you riveted from beginning to end.

Each frame of film captures the heart-breaking moments as the passengers unknowningly board UNITED 93, not unlike any of us would at any occasion, or the hectic job of an air traffic controller and the mistakes that were made, the red tape and numerous hoops that people had to jump through to get things done, all being too late, the insanity that drove the CULTISH Muslim terrorists to murder thousands on that day in the name of GOD, and ultimately the passengers of 93 that realized their fate and did the only thing they could... fight back.

UNITED 93 is not to be missed and without question should at least be a nominee for a 2006 Oscar for best picture.

The genius of UNITED 93 is that it didn't play like a movie. It's unconventional storytelling method is quite simply, REALISM. The documentary feel. Many of the air traffic controllers and FFA tower operators played themselves, really lending to the realism of the film. The actors didn't play like actors... they are real. They do their jobs and their roles so capably, you don't think you're watching a film. You are watching the real events.

Finally, UNITED 93 will pose questions. Like any great film should. Why were the heads of the FAA and the military so slow to react? Why did they doubt when they were told what was going on by a air traffic controller? Why wasn't the government brought into the loop sooner? and finally, how can Muslim men be so brainwashed, that they could believe that GOD, could condone and ask them to MURDER thousands of people who are peaceful, going to work and of many different races (many fellow Muslims) and countries.

They have obviously never been to New York City to see how EVERY race, religion, creed and sex is welcomed and has been thriving peacefully for years... together.

UNITED 93 is not to be missed.",1157932800,9,2020,4.625698324022347
1550311,5,B00005JOZI,"...but everyone should see it.  Absolutely riveting.  I had to pee really badly while we were watching but I couldn't bear to hit ""pause"".  Sorry to sound flippant; I just mean it was so absorbing I couldn't tear myself away from the TV.  A great, great film and a great testament to the day.  Please see it, you will be glad you did even though it's very hard to watch.",1157932800,,370,4.228571428571429
1550312,4,B00005JOZI,"United 93 is a unique film in that it employs a large cast of unrecognizable actors.  This is a smart choice since the specific tale of United flight 93 revolves largely around the everyday people aboard it and those trying to save it.  To cast Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts or Nicholas Cage as the singular focal point of the film would undermine the film's entire purpose.  United 93 afterall, is not a story of one, but of many.

United 93 is a film that defies genre.  It is not quite a documentary, not quite a drama, but a little of both.  It is at once riveting, chilling and often very hard to watch.  During the course of viewing the feelings of confusion and helplessness I felt that tragic day came washing back in an all too familiar way.  For recreating that, the film deserves great praise.  It's well worth the watch and is surprisingly bolstered by, not hurt by the fact that we know what will happen.

Yet I have to say the film is missing something that prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars.  Perhaps it's a lack of story closure.  Indeed, as a study of human behavior during times of stress, confusion and sheer trauma, United 93 works quite well.  It remains quite neutral and avoids passing judgment on any of the players in the events of that day.  But as the film builds to the crescendo, it falls somewhat flat at this most critical juncture.  When the credits roll the viewer is left more with a feeling of incompleteness and yearning for a statement of any kind that the film might have made.  Of course I realize that we don't have full closure on the events of 9/11 as a nation either.  But as a story it seems that United 93 could have taken the film one step further to give a bit more poigniance to the machinations of a tale we already know too well.",1157932800,3,1783,4.338368580060423
1550313,5,B00005JOZI,"My oldest daughter purchased 'United 93' on dvd last week and I had a chance to watch it this past weekend. I think that many people didn't want to see this film when it first came out because they thought is was going to be a dramatization of the entire flight that ended up in that field out in Shanksville, Pa. Thats not fair to the movie at all. While the only one of the 4 planes that day that is followed onscreen is United 93, the focus of the film is a bit larger in scale. We see air traffic controllers from various stations in the East trying to make sense out of planes in the air that don't respond to radio contact and transponders that seem to turn off on one flight. From my initial understanding, many of the people that were in the traffic control towers that day play themselves in this movie and their comfort with the terminology and ease of communication between them makes this feel more like a documentary rather then a feature film.

There are no movie 'stars' to be seen and in fact, none of the passengers are even named in the film, just as in real life people don't always go around announcing their names to each other. It's very effectively done and while heart wrenching because we know how it's going to end, its also probably the straightest examination of what happened that day that we've seen yet. Nothing is sensationalized, even the memorable ""Let's roll"" uttered by passenger Todd Beamer that day is almost lost in the background of everyone else's preparation for that final rush to the cockpit door. We get a chance to see possibly what it was like and what those people went through as they fought back to try and take control of that plane back. Thankfully as the movie builds to its climax, we are spared images of the crash. Instead the screen goes black and silent with the ground rushing up visably outside the cockpit windows a few seconds before the inevitable impact.

I haven't had a chance to view the extra features on this yet, but my daughter tells me that they show what great lengths the makers of this movie went to in order to try to get everything right. It shows on the screen. While the subject matter may not be something that bears repeated viewings often, I believe that its a worthwhile film to see at least once.",1157932800,2,2280,4.4391408114558475
1550314,5,B00005JOZI,"I'd like to address a couple of things.  First, to those who gave this 1 star because they didn't want to ""relive"" 9/11 again.  I can understand that, but why in the world would you watch a movie whose subject matter is not in question?

Second, to those who believe in the ""Loose-Change"" nonsense.  The LC folks can't even get their own stories straight.  In LC1, they said United 93 was shot down, then in LC2, they said the flight never crashed in PA.  Ooooookkkkk.

This film is so well researched and so well shot that it borders on a documentary.  Obviously the one thing missing are the actual conversations and final details of what happened on Flight 93 as it went into the ground.

After I watched the movie, I rewatched it the next day with the Audio commentary from Paul Greengrass.  Only then did I realize that many of the military and FAA players were actual FAA officials and/or air traffic controllers/military.  Some were the actual people on duty at the time.  This gives this film many steps above any others that attempt to dramatize 9/11.

There is no fluff.  No side stories.  No judgement.  Just the broadcast of a seemingly finely tuned system that goes to hell in an incredibly short time due to the enormity of the events which was beyond the imagination of everybody involved.",1157932800,4,1304,4.604347826086957
1550315,5,B00005JOZI,"This film demonstrates that cinema has not lost its ability to stir the soul. This may be the most important movie since Citizen Kane. This work of art brings clarity and simplicity to what happened on 9/11. Every American needs to see this movie to understand. Terribly sad and tragic, yes, but also inspiring.",1157846400,2,311,4.777777777777778
1550316,5,B00005JOZI,"I have to admit, having read the 9/11 Commission's report on the incompetency of those in the FAA and the military, I automatically assumed that they were all severely incompetent individuals. But this film unveils the humanity of these people who did their best under a system that was severely incompetent. As each horrible event unfolded that day, we see their stunned disbelief as it had been reflected in our own faces. They were seeing something they could not have imagined. In fact, when the military got word of the first hijacking on September 11th, their bewildered response was, ""in the real world?"" You see, they were running defense drills at that time against a possible Russian attack via Alaska. To say the world's greatest superpower was out of touch is putting it lightly. It would only take a person in stubborn denial to not realize that had the government who had received over a dozen memos about possible hijackings simply put that info into the official loop with the military and the FAA, the tragedies of September 11th could have been avoided. The cynicism and denial began at the top, when Condi Rice assumed that the word 'determined', as in ""Bin Laden determined to attack US"" meant the same as 'he'd like to', as in ""one day he'd like to visit Tahiti"". Citizens have the liberty to cynically toss out phrases like ""yeah, in his dreams"", but our government has to approach national security issues as if they were living in the real world, and that's what our government was completely out of touch with.

But to the film at hand ... It is as streamlined as any major motion picture has ever been, and hopefully a lesson to Hollywood that less is definitely more. I kept wondering where they found so many terrific actors to give such low-key performances until I discovered that most of the performers were 'real people' who worked with the FAA or the military or United Airlines. The long lens shakycam is something that usually drives me batty but it served the film well here since it works as a window into what really happened that day. The cinematography is also outstanding in how it used saturated lighting on the plane to create that sort of everyday haze one feels when they are in the skies flying backwards against time. Every detail was real, including blink or you'll miss 'em touches like the stewardess clutching onto a seat as she was about to be killed; something that we all do in desperate but futile moments when we will grab onto anything or anyone for a feeling of something safe and familiar. And kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the film score minimalist. I would have preferred none at all, but for the most part it is non-obtrusive and thankfully non-sentimental. At the end of the day, this is an excellent chapter in what will hopefully be many chapters that will put that day into its proper context of desperation and humanity.

One other note; do check out the bonus features. There are interviews with the surviving family members, and biographies on each of the passengers and crew. Despite the tears that will ensue, it will give you hope because you'll realize how many really wonderful people there are out there. The media always drowns us with details of the wicked, but they barely ever mention people like these passengers; so many of whom had dedicated their lives to saving the planet and to helping those who are less fortunate. To say they were heroes is no exaggeration.",1157846400,,3451,4.721393034825871
1550397,5,B00005JOZI,"The lives of the crew and passengers of United Flight 93 were extinguished when the Boeing 757 in which they were traveling plowed into Pennsylvania farmland on September 11, 2001. UNITED 93 pays them apt tribute.

This film takes a different approach than A&E's FLIGHT 93 - released almost simultaneously - and is in my judgment the better of two fine films. The dizzying flight from one civilian and military group trying to make sense of the incomprehensible and fast-moving events of that autumn morning helps the viewer feel in his marrow the sheer confusion that reigned. I do not think that confusion should be mistaken for incompetence in a nation unaccustomed to attacks on its own soil, and this film arguably allows the facts to stand without damning interpretation.

It is horrifying to watch the passengers' reconstructed predicament on the plane, and FLIGHT 93 does not avert its gaze from the fact that not all passengers might have agreed with the plan to take aircraft back. I am still shaking minutes after the film's conclusion, which starkly mimics the stubbornness of impact.

I find the juxtaposition of doomed victims praying the Lord's Prayer minutes before their death with the recitation of Koranic verse by the murderers who killed them unhelpful, but perhaps this bit of poetic license was not--as it might appear--intended to suggest a moral equivalence between those two very different acts of faith.

More horrifying than the A&E project, this film should be seen but  younger viewers are not likely to benefit from the horror it so movingly portrays.

One might, I suppose, pick up this DVD for voyeuristic purposes. Alternatively, it is a good thing for one hundred twenty minutes to stare evil and innocence in the face, to distinguish clearly between the two, and then to return to real life to live out one's choice.",1157846400,2,1852,4.958064516129032
1550398,5,B00005JOZI,"The DVD is the way to see this film, because of the extras. Certain films bear re-viewing with the director's voiceover, and this is one of them.  Paul Greengrass has approached this daunting task with an understanding of systems (""things went wrong because they were unimagined"") and a reverential respect for the families of those lost that day. You get a real-time portrayal of events on 9/11, beginning with the early morning prayers of the Muslim terrorists thru the dawning realization among passengers and crew and air traffic controllers (for them and us watching the news it was the moment the second WTC tower was  hit) that something extraordinary and destiny-altering was occurring.  The real-time documentary style generates a surreal mental clarity that slightly buffers the emotional tension of the events (compared to the movie ""World Trade Center"" for example).  Not to be missed is the 60-minute DVD extra on the families of the victims of United 93.  Many of the actors met the families of the lost one they were portraying, and this adds magnificently to the humanity in this project and the recording of the event.  The families were also invited to a screening of the film before it was released; another sobering and respectful touch.  Make sure to watch the DVD extra and hear the interview reactions to the screening by various family members.  You will have little interest or energy for watching any other portrayals, either overly dramatized or politicized, of what transpired that day.",1157846400,2,1514,5.052208835341365
1550399,5,B00005JOZI,"First,

September 11th was a traumatic time for the US.  I had only moved here from the UK 8 months previous, but even so, found myself searching high and low for a US Flag to hang outside my house to show my patriotism.  This was a traumatic film to make - which may explain why it had to be made by two European Companies - Working Title & Studio Canal, rather than a US company (Yes Universal is American, but they are the Distributor, not the maker).  It is probably still to traumatic for most Americans to comprehend - let alone recreate.

The movie is excellent, and it is nice to be able to see that at least two of these low-lifes were unable to see the destruction of those onboard - they got beaten to death.  Also, the fact that many of the individuals play themselves - including FAA and Military personnel.  This allows them to accurately bring their true emotions and reactions to the screen.  I truly found myself on the edge of my seat - which is a very rare occurance.

It is an emotional journey, and I am glad the film was made.  It is easy to forget the events of that day in todays busy world - but that is just the point.  We should NEVER forget.  Finally - watch the special features, it offers a very emotional documentary with the family of the deceased, and those actors playing them in the movie.",1157846400,4,1324,4.294354838709677
1550400,5,B00005JOZI,"This movie brought all the horror of 911 flooding back to me. I thought that this movie was more about the events going on in the background though. I also suggest watching the TV movie ""Flight 93"" which is more about the personal stories of the people on the flight. What really got me was the young lady who was talking with her mother on the phone until just before the plane went down. I kept thinking how I would feel if she was my daughter...",1157846400,2,448,4.22093023255814
1550401,5,B00005JOZI,"Since 2001, like many Americans, the days surrounding September 11 have been hard for me. I no longer sleep well; I am unsettled psychically, jumpy and easily depressed; but it cannot be nearly as hard on me as it is on those in close contact with the lost. This movie brings that horrible day back, presented in as close to real time as possible.

It was a beautiful, sparkling day,all across the U.S., which makes what happened even more stark. I can remember remarking to myself at about 7:15 a.m. my time - barely 45 minutes, New York time, before the chaos began - what a gorgeous day it was. The movie starts in that fashion - ordinary people going about their ordinary lives, engaging in light chitchat as they board, air traffic controllers attending to routine meetings and assignments, no hint that our world is about to be plunged into darkness.  The first hint comes from an alert controller in the Boston arena, who in an attempt to establish contact with AA11, intercepts what he instantly recognizes as a hijacking from the cockpit of that plane.

A lot of the personnel represented in this movie are the real deal, controllers and supervisors actually involved in the activities that day. Several traffic towers are shown; NORAD is included; and the degree of confusion and uncertainty which was rampant on that day is aptly depicted. There is misunderstanding and misinformation, which is understandable; we have never undergone anything of this magnitude or evil before, couched in would-be platitudes of religious fervor. The sheer disbelief that anyone could be capable of this is visible on the faces of the controllers who watch in horror as the second plane immolates the South Tower.

As the WTC is attacked, United 93 - ironically delayed in takeoff - rises from the tarmac into the sun. For some time no one is aware of danger; a message from the cockpit computer to the pilots, bewaring of cockpit intrusion, is mused about by the pilots calmly eating their breakfast. The hijackers fidgit in their seats, waiting for word from their leader, until one cannot stand it any more and rushes an attendant, starting the chaos in the plane. From there the story is told in what we know from phone conversations and the voice recorder, heartbreaking vigniettes of the terror 40 people suffered in a cramped enclosure they could not escape. The courage is unmistakable; there only appeared to be hysteria at the end, with inevitability at hand. I was proud to be an American with other Americans who acted with such fortitude as the passengers on United 93.

This is a powerful film, one that should be required viewing in some college classes - not by all, perhaps; it is gutwrenching and a shock to the system. But if the families of those who were lost think it is important - and it is clear that they do, in one of the bonus features - it is the duty of those of us here now to honor the memories of those valiant passengers.",1157846400,5,2949,4.696324951644101
1550402,5,B00005JOZI,"I just finished watching United 93, it was very well done.  The movie starts out showing the normalcy that started September 11, 2001 and it ends in the same emotional state that those events brought to America.

What an emotionally upsetting piece of work, I believe today as I did five years ago that every American should start their day watching the collapse of the WTC.  Every person that died that day should be remembered, it doesn't matter if this terrorist action was the result of US government policy or not, human lives were lost.  Whether the invasion of Iraq was a mistake or not, we still lost those lives that day.

The movie ends as abruptly as the lives aboard flight 93 did.  The black screen leaves you very emotional, contemplating what you just witnessed.  I personally felt on that day in 2001 American did not have the stomach for what needed to be done, I still feel this way.

To everyone that died that terrible day, I pray that God grant you the rest you have earned",1157760000,4,994,4.5139664804469275
1550403,5,B00005JOZI,"I can not really add to the words already written regarding the movie itself; this was a powerful and moving experience.

The 2-Disc Limited Edition (LE) DVD, which has yet to be sold by Amazon.com proper, consists of a widescreen movie-only disc (identical to the single-disc edition and its supplements) and a second bonus disc.

This bonus disc contains one documentary--""Chasing Planes - Witnesses to 9/11"" that features interviews with military and FAA/air traffic control personnel.  Several of these people played themselves in the movie.  The documentary is 48 minutes long, and interspersed with clips from the movie to illustrate the situations described.  It is 1.78x1 anamorphic widescreen, English language, with optional English, French, and Spanish subtitles.

I fail to understand Universal's ongoing pattern of releasing limited editions that do not even cover initial demand.  The same was true with Jarhead and Munich.  Thankfully, I was able to find Munich at Barnes and Noble (who now seems to have United 93 LE); also, the limited edition supplements for Jarhead were included later on the HD DVD.

The good news is that the first disc of the LE is the same as the widescreen single-disc edition that is readily available.  This core movie disc includes commentary by the director, written biographies of 40 of the passengers and crew on Flight 93, a documentary focusing on the families and the film, and a trailer to the short documentary film Twin Towers.

1550404,5,B00005JOZI,This movie was very difficult to watch.  We know the ending.  We know what happens to these people.  But we also know that each passenger and crew member was a hero.  This movie honors their memory and sacrifice.  Well done.,1157760000,4,224,4.5
1550405,5,B00005JOZI,"I spent a great deal of time over the past 5 years since 9/11 speculating about what might have happened on the United 93 flight after the passengers found out about the morning's events.  Mostly, I questioned whether I would have had the courage to take action as some of the passengers evidently did, or if I would have cowered in a corner, a snivelling coward waiting to die and crying quick and hot tears over a life not lived to its fullest.

Among the many emotional responses I had to this electrifying film when I saw it in a shamefully empty theatre the day it came out, ""United 93"" made me face that question again in a very aggressive and in-your-face way.  This isn't just a story of tragic events.  It is a story of human character.

Equally terrified during the day's events were the various civilian and military airline control center employees.  Forced to act quickly and decisively when dealing with partial facts and a rapidly-unfolding terror timeclock, they were having to take action while the vast majority of people in the world were standing around dumbstruck and speechless.

""United 93"" covers the day's events in docudrama style from multiple agencies' perspectives and every single one of them draws you in and grabs you by the throat.

I could hear people in the theatre stop breathing several times.  There was more than a little crying.

Much was made in the press about how it may have been ""too soon"" to tell this story again in such a frank and brutally honest way.  Well guess what -- it some ways it will ALWAYS be too soon, but that doesn't mean the story shouldn't be told.  We all need to watch this to remind ourselves of how it felt to be so scared and emotionally raw.  Don't wait until you've let Time numb you to the day's events.

This movie works on every level it intended to.  The fact that it is both difficult to sit through and impossible to turn away from is a testament to not only the powerful nature of the events themselves but also to the filmmakers' unflinching and honest presentation of them.

This could have been a sappy melodramatic TV movie that pulled punches and glossed over painful details.  Instead, this film feels more ""real"" than any film in recent memory.

When you watch it at home, please maximize the impact of the experience by recreating the Theatrical experience as best you can:  Turn off all the lights, unplug the phone, go the bathroom in advance, and keep the chatter down.

This is too important an experience to treat like just another Weekday Night on the Couch.

**** In spite of the fact that I am more convinced with each passing day that the conspiracy theorists about 9/11 may actually be telling the ugly truth, I still will re-iterate that ""United 93"" is a stunningly powerful work of dramatic cinema.  Whether the significant details are even remotely true or not, it doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the story as told by this film.

The raw emotions of fear, sorrow, anger, and desperation grab you and pull you in, putting you on that doomed flight among the passengers. There is nothing entertaining about 'United 93.' It's value is in its honest depiction of what happened on that horrible day, and as a tribute to those brave men and women who perished. Their stories deserve to be told.

1550510,5,B00005JOZI,"I watched ""United 93"" a week after watching ""Flight 93"" again and while I have no problem with multiple tellings of the same story, it is interesting to compare and contrast the two films to better appreciate what is happening in this one.  Both films begin with the terrorist hijackers saying their morning prayers, a grotesque irony that continues to fuel the conflict between radical Islamic fundamentalists and the West.  But at that point writer-director Paul Greengrass sets a different tone for this theatrical film because we do not see any of the passengers and crews at their homes.  Instead we get to Newark Airport and the pilots and flight attendants walk on board the doomed flight, while the terrorists and passengers gather in the terminal.  In ""Flight 93"" we saw the names on the tickets of the passengers as they went through the final checkpoint, but in this film Greengrass makes no effort to clearly establish names (unless you turn on the subtitles, then names are identified when characters speak off camera).  You may know enough about the flight to recognize which character is Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, Mark Bingham, or any of the others, but their individuality is not necessary to the story being told.  Greengrass talks about it being a collective experience and that is clearly his approach to telling the story.

For me the most memorable parts of ""Flight 93"" were with the family members on the ground who were giving information and support to the passengers on the plane.  In ""United 93"" we never see or hear those family members, so the two films compliment each other in that regard.  What Greengrass offers it is place is the air traffic controlling system dealing with the hijackings, focusing on the inability to comprehend what was going on and the confusion as the system tried to catch up with events.  While he hired actors and actresses that would not be easily recognizable to viewers for everyone on United 93, Greengrass got several of the people at the FAA, the air traffic control systems, and even with the U.S. military, to play themselves.  Of course we do not recognize any of them, but the verisimilitude is from their language and their reactions, because what is ultimately important here is that Greengrass is not trying to explain the events of 9/11.  Instead, he is trying to recreate them and to depict the confusion rather than indicting or excusing it.  I think Greengrass makes it clear that even as the bits and pieces of key information emerge as to what is going one, that there was nothing that could be done for the simple reason that events that were unfolding were beyond imagination.  It is not until the second plane hits the second tower that the obvious connection led to the ultimate realization.

The use of nonprofessional actors, the refusal to even identify let alone establish key characters, and the improvisational nature of the production, all give ""United 93"" a documentary feel.  Actually, the more I think about it I would amend that to be that the film lacks a lot of what we would expect in a Hollywood dramatization, so that it does not seem like a movie.  There is a sense that we are there, which is certainly a key part of documentaries, but that the movie unfolds in real time gives it much more of a sense of immediacy.  Technical jargon is being bandied about my lots of people, without ever bothering to explain what it all means, adding to the sense of confusion.  But we know what is going to happen and so we understand the irony that minutes after United 93 took off from Newark, with the tops of the World Trade Center towers visible out the window past one of the terrorists, when American 11 disappears on the air traffic control radar what has happened.  Not that this intellectual knowledge makes the emotional impact any less, because it is out ability to connect the dots and be ahead of the people we see on the screen that provides a lot of the power of the narrative.  The final act of the film takes place entirely on the airplane, where there is a real sense of how quickly the passengers put together the information, decided to act, and then tried to regain control of the plane.

In his commentary track Greengrass gets into much more of the details of what happened that day, as well as emphasizing what he was trying to do with these scenes.  So if you want more of an explanation for what was happening, Greengrass provides that to some degree.  The one new element that stood out for me was the idea that one of the passengers knew how to fly a single engine plane, so that there was the hope that with the pilots dead there was somebody who could land the plan, albeit with a lot of help from ground control.  I am not sure what I think of introducing that element of hope, because one of the key elements of the heroism of these passengers was that stopping the terrorists from their objective (certainly either the White House or more probably the Capitol building), was as important as trying to regain control of the plane.

While this film does not show the families of the passengers, there is an hour-long featurette on the families and the making of ""United 93,"" so they are present on the DVD as well.  There are also memorial pages for all of the passengers and crew, posted by family members (arranged alphabetically by first name, in another nice touch).  Finally, there is a trailer for the Academy Award Winning Short Documentary ""Twin Towers.""  What you will not find here are any deleted scenes, although Greengrass talks about an alternative opening sequences set in Afghanistan.  It makes sense that a film told in real time would not have deleted scenes, but we know that there were alternate takes because of the improvisational nature of the film, so I want to applaud Greengrass for putting together his final cut and sticking with it.",1157673600,9,5877,4.688715953307393
1550511,5,B00005JOZI,"I'm not an expert of the details of what happened on 9/11/2001, but I did follow this story at the time.  It really was a tragedy and the start of the change we as Americans see the world and the real threat that is out there.  At the time, this story was a true turning point on how I saw the world and after that, I wanted to be kept informed so I tune in to any information concerning national security and the war on terrorism.  I also remember how many people were so involved in this story and how much it impacted this nation at the time.  Now 5 years later, I'm sad to say that most Americans are not as informed and passionate for the cause of this ongoing war on terrorism.  I believe, that this movie must be seen to as many Americans as possible to remember and to keep up the passion and to support the war on terror.  The movie itself is very important, probably more important than most contemporary films.  I totally support the message that this film is sending out and I frown upon Osama Bin Laden, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and other Arab/Muslim terrorist groups out there that spread this evil upon this already troubled world.",1157673600,4,1142,4.3584905660377355

Cast:  Christian Clemenson, Trish Gates, Polly Adams, Cheyenne Jackson, Opal Alladin, Gary Commock, Nancy McDoniel, David Allen Basche, Richard Bekins.

Running Time: 111 minutes

Rated R for language and some intense sequences of terror and violence (although a PG-13 rating is probably more appropriate and the film's producers have appealed the initial rating).

There weren't many notes you could take, whether it be in the equilibrious opening or the terrifying denouement that can describe the feelings you endure along ""United 93"". Ample publicity has been sold on Paul Greengrass' new movie, debating the veracity of its story and whether there was a need for it to be made in the first place. How soon is too soon? How long did America wait to tell of Vietnam's nightmares? You would have been forgiven for thinking it blasphemous to even entertain the idea of shooting a movie on 9/11, yet despite the controversy United 93 is here, and will attract an audience regardless (or maybe even as a result of) its negative press.

Shot in real time, on digital camera, ""United 93"" begins with showing us the terrorists making their final morning prayers, before setting off to the airport. There are no handsome grins, nor are there nasty frowns. These men, if anything, look more terrified than you ever could. Their intentions are hidden behind an obvious human front that continually puts them at odds with themselves. We then shift to the airport's other passengers, none of which are ever given an emotional edge to them. As the film goes on we visit the men and women behind the running of the airwaves - particularly those responsible for what should happen in case of emergencies. Many of the actors betraying these people are the people themselves, who were there on that tragic day. Using non-actors gives Greengrass' film an authentic breeze of dialogue and behavior that never seems forced or embellished. Whilst we never truly get a feel for any individual character we believe every word they say, and truly understand the circumstances they were put in as the tragedies unfolded. We learn how difficult it was to get in touch with the White House, when the people needed their government the most. We also learn of the confusion experienced as these planes went strangely off course before any conclusive knowledge of a hijacking had been established. But the film's biggest power lies in the chilling reenactment of the fate of flight 93. All forms of dramatic irony are completely dropped. We can feel unease just by the soft, subtle touch of the film's score. During the opening the characters act like any man would in these types of totally conventional circumstances. Greengrass does not incorporate a view of hindsight for his audience, instead allowing the film to flow in the moment, with each passing event happening as the characters read it, rather than what the audience already knows occurred. It isn't a movie that allows much headway for dramatic convention, nor does it satisfy are needs for entertainment (which, perhaps, is what ""Titanic"" was aiming to do). All it ever tries to do, and what it achieves in great effect, is a tribute to the courage and bravery of the passengers and staff aboard United 93.

Paul Grenngrass' masterpiece is the anti-""Titanic"": there are no star-crossed lovers, no dastardly bad guys, no romantic journeys and absolutely zero poetic license. This is as frighteningly real as a movie gets. The characters of ""United 93"" are so authentic it verges on the mundane at times. The characters aren't meant to have depth, nor are they meant to go through life-affirming changes. The film is a fine illustration, similar to the faux-documentaries that Greengrass directed in his native Great Britain that documents the haunting ordeal induced by the passengers, and their subsequent bravery in attempting to foil the terrorists. The final sequence is one of the most terrifying set-pieces ever put on film, managing to raise every strand on my body to an electric edge, as the passengers desperately try to kick down the cabin door when, in one blisteringly quick moment of hope, you actually believed they can prevent it. That they can save themselves. And for this reason alone, it is a masterful piece of work, deserving of the highest praise a film can receive. Regardless of what your stance was before the film was released, ""United 93"" is a film you have to see. You owe it to the people it illustrates, in fittingly faux-reality style, and whose bravery it commends. As a film viewer all we could ever ask of a film is to work as a piece of art. That is all anyone should ever ask. It is, at times, worrying, distressing, haunting and terrifying. But never wrong and certainly a piece of art.",1157587200,6,4789,4.9183168316831685

All the actors acted well including the hijackers. Which is why you feel angry at them.

What a mess they have made of our country !

1550514,5,B00005JOZI,"Director Paul Greengrass brings the story of United flight 93 to life in this fitting tribute to the heroes aboard the flight who refused to go quietly.  On September 11, 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked by middle eastern terrorists.  Two of the planes were flown into the World Trade Center, one hit the Pentagon, and the fourth, flight 93, was destined for another target, most likely the White House or the U.S. Capitol, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the flight never reached its intended target.

This move shows all aspects of that terrible day in September.  From the opening scenes of the terrorists preparing themselves for death to the scenes in the confused and hectic air control rooms, this film revisits one of the darkest days in our history.

The story of flight 93 is inspiring and serves as a beacon of light which continues to shine today for those who remember 9/11.  The depiction of the flight in the movie is very good.  The movie begins with the passengers and crew boarding the aircraft for what initially appeared to be a normal flight from Newark to San Fransisco.  However, in the control rooms across the country, a much different story was unfolding.  One of the controllers reported hearing screams and foreign voices from one of the planes.  This turned out to be United flight 11.  The controllers cointinued to monitor the flight until, mysteriously, the plane disappeared from the screen.  This was the first plane to hit the World Trade Center.

Meanwhile, aboard flight 93, the four terrorists sprung their own hijacking.  Using a homemade bomb (which was really fake) and box cutters, the terrorists managed to gain entrance into the cockpit and contol of the plane.  Immediately, the terrorists turned the plane around and began heading back east.  Several passenegrs, including the pilot and co-pilot, were stabbed by the terrorists.  Some of the passengers began making cell phone calls to loved ones on the ground, and in the process, they learned about the attacks on the WTC.  Realizing that their plane was probably going to be used in the same way as the ones which struck the WTC, the passengers began to formulate a plan to re-take the plane from the terrorists.  Despite the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the plane crashed in western Pennsylvania, about 10 minutes' flying time from Washington, D.C.  No one survived.

This movie serves as  a stirring tribute to those heroic souls who banded together and fought to save not only themselves, but perhaps hundreds of others as well.  I was impressed with the coverage of the air traffic controllers and how they struggled with handling the hijackings.  It was both amazing and somewhat heart-wrenching seeing these dedicated people doing their best to ensure the safety of the people aboard the hijacked planes.

The acting in the movie is very good.  Christian Clemenson (Tom Burnett), Cheyenne Jackson (Mark Bingham), David Alan Basche (Todd Beamer), and Peter Hermann (Jeremy Glick) give performances worthy of their characters' names. The other actors, especially the air traffic controllers, give rousing performances, also. The story is told with realism, but the viewer gets a sense of compassion as well.

I highly recommend this heroic story about forty people who sat down as strangers, but stood up as one.  This movie honors the memory of the fallen with dignity and grace, and their story of heroism in the face of certain death should serve as a message to everyone.  Watch this fine movie and see how forty ordinary people banded together as one.",1157587200,14,3615,4.948590381426202

I'm sure most of us have put ourselves on that plane and wondered what we would have done.  These heroes gave their lives in order to SAVE other lives.  Such a stark contrast to the monsters who hijacked the planes and were willing to give their lives in order to MURDER others!  I did not know what to expect of a Hollywood production, but I must say the film's makers did a superlative job in creating the atmosphere that must have existed. It was eerie to see the contrast between the terrorists praying to their god for success in murdering people, and the crew and passengers praying for life and/or redemption upon death.  Not only was the movie filmed in real time, it actually made you feel that you were there on the plane.

Not because I am saying that it is a poorly made movie as some have suggested. But if I could go my whole life without seeing some of the images in that movie, I would.  I understand that the people on United 93 did a great thing and went through a lot of disgusting and vile stuff.  Why do we need to see it?  Just because they went through it why do I have to see it?  I remember several horrible tragedies in the LA area in the 1980s when the nightstalker was going around killing people and was finally captured by a mob of angry citizens.  Have they made a graphic movie about that? ...showing knives getting trust into peoples necks and choking people to death.  I believe that the people who have seen this movie and view it as a means to remember what happened on 9-11 have some serious issues when they have to be reminded of the horror that went on that day by visually seeing it.  There are scenes from this movie that I will never get out of my head as long as I live.  Do not see this movie unless you have serious problems remembering 9-11.",1157414400,18,1169,4.1371681415929205
1550538,5,B00005JOZI,"On September 11, 2001, four commercial airplanes were hijacked by teams of terrorists and used as missiles to strike twice in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The fourth plane never reached its intended target and crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. United 93 dramatizes the events leading up to and speculates on what happened on this fourth plane before it lost control and crashed into the ground killing everyone on board.

The inevitable question a film like United 93 raises is, it is still too soon for a film like this to be made? And if you do make a commercial film about 9/11 what kind of approach do you take that doesn't exploit such a sensitive event and do a disservice to the people who died tragically on that horrible day? What about the families of the people who died? How would they feel about a movie dramatizing what happened to their loved ones?

And so it was with much trepidation when United 93 was announced but some of the concerns were put to rest when it was revealed that Paul Greengrass would be writing and directing the movie. He had previously directed the powerful Bloody Sunday, a gut-wrenching docudrama of the Derry massacre in Ireland on January 30, 1972. If anyone could keep true to the facts and not pander to sappy sentimentalism or flag-waving patriotism it would be Greengrass.

What makes this film work so well is that it was made outside of the Hollywood studio system and this allowed Greengrass to cast unknown actors, character actors and even actual people who were witness to what happened that day. By doing this we aren't distracted from what is going on in the film like an easily identifiable movie star would. Another element that stands out is the use of hand-held cameras to give a sense of immediacy commonly associated with cinema verite. It also gives a documentary feel early on when we see the plane being boarded and all the work done to get it ready. It is this kind of attention to detail that gives United 93 a certain level of authenticity.

United 93 is a film you don't watch, you endure. It is very upsetting to watch (as it should) but is an important movie nonetheless because it shows, with unflinching honesty, what might have happened on that plane based on phone conversations from passengers before they died. United 93 is an important film because we must not forget what happened on 9/11 and what these people went through and the sacrifices they made. This film is a fitting tribute to them.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Paul Greengrass. Greengrass has a tendency to speak slowly and ponderously but is very articulate when he explains his intentions for a given scene or talks about the events of that day. He gets a little pretentious at times but does speak knowledgably about the film.

""United 93: The Families and the Film"" focuses on the families of the people who died on United Flight 93. Several of them are interviewed and talk about their thoughts on the movie and how they feel about their loved ones being depicted by actors. To that end, we see some of the cast meeting with the family members of the person they portrayed in the movie and it is obviously an emotional moment for all involved.

""Memorial Pages"" provides brief biographical sketches and moving tributes to each flight crew member and passenger on United Flight 93. This is a great idea and a fitting tribute to these people, amply illustrating how each and every one of them were unique and memorable with their own distinctive lives.

Finally, on the 2-disc Limited Edition, there is an additional extra - ""Chasing Planes - Witnesses to 9/11,"" a documentary about the men and women who tracked all the planes on that day and how they dealt with the crisis as it was unfolding. There are interviews with many of the air traffic controllers working that day some of whom played themselves in the movie.",1157414400,13,3905,4.682215743440233

Director of 'UNITED 93' Paul Greengrass does a wonderful job setting in motion the approximate timeline of events leading up to the end when the doomed flight crashed. I remembered the movie he directed back a decade or so ago ""Bloody Sunday"" - You felt you were there as British troops were firing on unarmed protestors. This movie gives you that 'Greengrass effect' - you felt you were on that plane with the passengers, the flight controllers on the ground and the confusion of FAA and US Military responses to this unfolding tragedy. I was not able to move during this movie, a rare thing for me. I couldn't go off to the restroom, this movie was THAT powerful.

Paul Greengrass and his talented crew have taken what might have been a less rewarding experience and created a defining testament to the power of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable consequences.  Although the title, United 93, is a plane, the real thrust of this movie is flesh and blood, feelings, fears and all the emotions that make us who we are.

1550615,5,B00005JOZI,"The first theatrical film to deal with 9/11, Paul Greengrass' unflinching and harrowing United 93 boldly re-creates the plane flight that crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers thwarted the hijackers bent on crashing the plane into a DC building.
The current controversy with Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, to which a cry of ""Too Soon"" echoes was also pointed at United 93. Within that uncertainty about 9/11 as film subject, Greengrass essentially has produced a terse, stomach-churning documentary, or rather dramatization, featuring the actual people in control towers, and flight control centers.
As a film on it's own, United 93 could be called a horror film, a thriller, or a documentary. But 9/11 is such a monumental time in history that anyone unfamiliar with it would be even harder to find than a theatre featuring the film itself, so it's existence as film comes with a weight uncomparable to any other moment in a generation.
I praise Greengrass for his attention to detail, his use of the actual people who were there and involved that day, and his ability to produce the supposed experience of the people on the plane, hi-jackers included, as well as his direction-jumping from the plane to the ground with a pacing that is very tense and emotionally jarring.

Only problem with buying this DVD: who would ever want to see this film in a regular basis ? Not me so I'll pass on what I consider 5 star material.,1155945600,12,509,4.204081632653061
1550617,5,B00005JOZI,"Taking into consideration that 2006, with theatrical and television movies alike, was going to be the year of World Trade Center related epics, I decided that 5 years was enough for me to get over it. I was never there, in fact, I had been in Arizona at the time over 2000 miles away, but 3 people I knew were in that buildings, and it had been just as devastating an experience as it was for people who were actually there to see it.

For me, I have no problems with these movies whatsoever, but being the type of person who sees films on a regular basis, you must understand that the whole ""Based on a true story"" propaganda always reels me, especially when I saw it all and know exactly what's going on. Having already seen ""Flight 93"", the television film which had shocked me, I found no sense in seeing United 93 because I figured I was probably going to just be seeing the same thing over and just wasting my. How terribly wrong I was. I also had to consider that I wasn't going to be able to see it alone because I am 16 and the film was Rated R. Subsequent family members said there was nothing bad to it at all, and they, like me, had seen the television film as well but said this was miles above that one.

On the seemingly normal morning of September 11th, 2001, several people prepared for their jobs. Whether it be ground control for the airport in New York or Washington D.C. or a business flight out of either, it was supposed to be a routine day. That was until 4 planes over the east coast were high-jacked by a group of terrorists out of the Middle East. 2 planes reached their target at the World Trade Center, 1 more also reached it's target at the Pentagon in Washington D.C. This is the story of the fourth which never reached it's target.

What I appreciated most about United 93 is the way Paul Greengrass brought about the portrayal of each of the real people aboard the plane. Each was brought out with no background, no explanation to why they were on the plane in the first place, and no popular actors to play them, which is exactly the way they were in real life. Normal people with regular lives, not at all unlike us. They didn't stand out until that day, and even in the movie none of them stand out particularly. Everyone is an important part of the story. The writers did nothing to inhance the characters to make the movie, which made it so much better. Greengrass was most respectful in that aspect, and I must congratulate him in doing so.

The ensemble cast of mainly unknown actors was absolutely incredible, especially since so many of them were so unexperienced. The dialogue they had to master was also difficult challenge for them I'm sure. To explain, most of the people understand that the script was written to include dialogue in which the characters interrupted and overlapped themselves on a regular basis just as people do in real life everyday, even with included ""um""s. The only direct back and forth dialogue is read by the terrorists.

The shoestring budget of $15 million dollars was well spent and was exactly what the television film had. Better production values, and an ending that will leave you seeing exactly what the passengers saw when United 93 went down will leave you gasping for breath and stone cold after the film ends. Not everything is a happy ending, and it sure wasn't for these poor souls. One thing I know for sure in my heart is that United 93 is not a film that enhances the true story in anyway.

I personally think that this is a fine time to release movies on the subject because more and more people are beginning to put this day in the back of their minds because it was 5 years ago, it's old news to them. So i really had high hopes for this movie.  But what I got was a very non-emotional movie.

The acting was very unrealistic to me.  Personally, I felt that everyone was acting way too calm given the situation they were in.  When they found out the plane was highjacked, they didn't seem as frantic or scared as they would have been in reality.  It seemed like everyone was keeping very well calmed, and we all know that it couldn't have been that way.

I recently saw the TV-version of this movie and thought that they did a better job with that one.  This movie barely touched the tragic final goodbyes that the passengers had with their families over their phones.  This movie was more concentrated on building up to the big hostile takeover of the plane at the very end than it was on the emotional state of mind that the people were in during that time.  This seemed more like a movie that just wanted to recall the passengers devising a plan to take back the plane, and to me, it was more than just the plan.

This movie was a great idea, it was just done poorly.  And I think that everyone who has been giving this movie 5-star reviews knows it in the back of their minds.  I just think that people were afraid to give this movie a bad review because of what it represents.  People feel guilty trash-talking a movie about 9/11.  But for me, I feel good about it.  This movie does not deserve to be praised.  If you're going to make a movie about 9/11, you have to be sure to do it right.  But again, any movie about 9/11 is going to get excellent reviews.  So I'm sure everyone that reads this is going to hate me for slamming this movie, but you all know it's true.  This was a poorly made movie on a subject that deserves a masterpiece.  I only hope Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" will succeed where this movie falls short, which is emotion.  But even if it's a terrible movie, I'm sure it will still get excellent reviews because it's about 9/11.",1155081600,22,2325,4.260273972602739
1550619,5,B00005JOZI,"I understand that most people didn't want to see the film because they felt it was just too soon. I disagree. This film comes at a critical point in our time. Most people want to forget that 9/11 ever happened, but the fact remains is it did. And we must never forget those who gave their lives to save others. If we don't learn from history, than it is bound to repeat itself.

United 93 is a minute by minute account of the doomed flight, but it also focuses on what was happening on the ground. Many people criticize the events of that day as our being unprepared. And we were, simply because something like this had never occured before. In fact, the film shows that many people did a great job at trying to figure out what was going on to try and prevent it.

This film features no actors you've ever heard of, because the film-maker Paul Greengrass felt that any stars would just take away from how ordinary the people were on the flight. He was right. That is my one complaint about Oliver Stone's new film is that he uses Nicholas Cage as one of the characters.

Even though you know how the film is going to end, it is still gut wrentching to watch the people final hour and a half of life, and the fear they must have gone through, and the courage they had to give their all to stop evil. It truely makes you think if you would have done the same thing in there place. The film also deserves kudos on the fact that it show radical Islamic terrorist as the enemy we still need to face and that our troops still face them in Afganistan and Iraq.

I'm not ashamed to admit I was bawling by the end of the film, because it struck me to the very center of my soul. I know I was not the only one in my showing crying. This film is, without a doubt, one of the best of the year, if not the best.",1154995200,17,1798,4.113960113960114

I remember calling my girlfriend after the movie was over and all I could hear on the other end was ""hello, are you there"". I am not sure if it was the emotional ending, the adrenaline pumping through my veins or the remembrance of the incredible loss of that day, but I could not speak.

I do know that if you choose to watch this film you will come away a different person. The sheer courage of the passengers and crew on United Flight 93 will always be remembered. This film is a reenactment of what happened on September 11, 2001 to the people on United flight 93 and the thousands of people, victims, and government agencies on the ground.

This film respectfully represents those that lost their lives that day. I think that we as a nation at times need to be reminded of the horrific attack, lest we let down our guard.",1154390400,12,942,4.346590909090909
1550621,4,B00005JOZI,"There is a History Channel TV movie entitled Flight 93 that in my opinion is just as good, if not better than this one. ""United 93"" focuses more on what happened behind the scenes with air traffic control and the military's frustration over the rules of engagement during the crisis. The History Channel movie focuses on what happened on the plane with the hijackers and passengers. From what I have read, the television version is amazingly accurate in dialogue and sequence of events.

Personally, I much prefer the History Channel version, which I realize may cost me some votes, but I really don't care. Yes, it is a ""milder"" version, but the acting is superb and I like the fact that the dialogue is pretty exact, based on research, extensive interviews and public records. United 93, by comparison, is incredibly good and moves at a faster clip (the action part anyway, the dialogue, as I will address later, is incredibly slow), but its focus, as I mentioned before, is on the more technical end -we learn quite a bit more about what the air traffic controllers and miltary personnel went through. The scenes on the plane are brief and at times choppy.

I guess it all boils down to a matter of preference. If you would prefer to learn more about what happened on the plane during this tragedy, buy ""Flight 93"". If however you want a precise technical viewpoint from the ground, then ""United 93"" is your movie.  Both are great, United 93 has a lotof extraneous dialogue and detail, but that is to be expected because of its focus.

Enjoy.

1550622,5,B00005JOZI,"That is what we must do, never forget the people that died on September 11, and movies like United 93 help us to remember those who died.  Everything about that day is reccounted slowly and in great detail.  We meet the passengers, the flight operators, and the hijackers.  We see the first reports, the towers being hit, and United 93 going down in a cornfield in Pennsylvania.  It is very emotional and disturbing.

The film ends on a black screen, dedicated to those who endured 9/11.  This film is very well made and Paul Greengrass was the perfect choice to direct this movie.  The actors are all unknown, but they all do a good job.  Early in the movie a man almost misses the plane, but just gets there in time, and you know that hes going to die.

Overall this is a well-made film and is emotional hard to watch, but you have to, have to never forget.",1153785600,13,859,4.352201257861635
1550680,4,B00005JOZI,"Critics went crazy over this movie (a movie which can 'almost' can be called a documentary). Fortunatly, I hadn't seen this hype before visiting my local theater, and therefor have been able to form my own uninfluenced descision.

United 93 takes the viewer back to the tragedy of september 11, the planes crashing in the WTC and in the Pentagon (which is still unsure, but that's another discussion). As a non-US citizen, I have to admit that the disaster was too far away to really hit me. Ofcourse I felt sorry for everyone involved and showed by compassion. But still, because it was so far away, and since I didn't saw anything more than amature video's, things went by without deep affection. I expected this movie to turn my head and push my nose on the facts of the situation happened. It partly did, but consequently, partly didn't.

First of all, the movie is slow and probably even longwinded. I can tell that the movie producers have had a hard time finding a balance between showing the reality and thus making it more a documentary, and on the other hand trying to keep the viewer interested in being a movie. I tend to believe that the documentary part overruled the other. The movie plays almost realtime, taken every minute as every minute, and at the same time trying to capture every emotion and person involved. This is hard, if not impossible, to transform this to a movie that keeps everyone interested. I've seen people leaving the cinema halfway, and to be honest, I had the small urge to do so too.

The upside of the extended showing of the situation is that you get really drawn in when the 'action' really happens. Employees of the airport seeing the undetected airplane flying into the WTC seems remarkably believable, as do the hijack and crashing of United 93 itself. Credits for this should partly go to the director, which has an almost irritating way of camerawork with an insane amount of close ups. It doesn't really get to the state of irritation at the end, because it does give the viewer the feeling that they don't have a full overview either, and it's probably the only way to film this as 'hectic', 'uncontrollable' and 'panic'.

The cast does a great job aswell, especially considering the fact that they had a lot to live up to; trying to immitate a historic event without looking overdone or unbelievable. There were a couple of moments where I thought: 'Yeah, right..', but they were in small amounts.

There should be are warning sign on the dvd release or cinema poster saying: 'Only if you're interested in the real deal'. This isn't for people who just want an entertaing and fun night out, it's for the people who are interested in the event, and are willing to take a couple of longwinding minutes for granted.

All in all a great 'movie', the important parts get deseverfully accentuated where needed, the directing is a little claustrophobic but fitting and the cast does an overall great job. My only complaint is that it is almost dull at times, narrowing the target viewers to a smaller group.",1153008000,5,3051,4.672253258845438

1550685,5,B00005JOZI,"""United 93"" is probably the most compelling and dramatic work of film that I have ever seen!  It's a roller coaster ride of adrenalin and jagged emotions.  It's also poignant at times and very close to the bone.  Most importantly, it's about an event that was true.

I saw ""United 93"" in Sydney as part of the Sydney Film Festival where it received applause at its end.  This rarely happens in Australia.  This is a film that touches everyone.  It is a film that must be seen!

Of course, we all know what happened on 11 September 2001.  Thus, the core of the film has no surprises.  However, having said this, the film so clearly reveals how ordinary people going about their own lives were suddenly thrust into a living hell.  Psychotic religious fanatics had come to believe that by hijacking planes and killing innocent people that this would somehow damage the US and heighten the spread of Islam.  Has collective lunacy ever reached such insane heights?  These criminals were not warriors, they were simply misguided killers.  Their inherent evil, unfortunately, came at the cost of so many lives.

This film covers the events of that tragic day very well.  We see chaos as both individuals and government bodies simply fail to adequately comprehend the events unfolding around them.  This should come as no surprise as there would be no one who could have expected criminal stupidity on the scale that was seen on that bright September day.  To all those involved in the making of ""United 93"", you are owed much gratitude as you have so lucidly told a tale of courage in the face of evil.",1151107200,9,1595,4.676258992805756
1550686,5,B00005JOZI,"I do not know how many people will have the sort of reaction that my wife and I had after watching United 93, the new film about the ""fight that fought back"" on September 11, but I suspect there will be many. I've been mulling over how I ought to approach this review, as there are actually two main avenues I could take. I could focus either on the film as a film: the acting, the directing, the score, the quality of the overall storytelling, or I could focus on my own emotional reaction: the actual phenomenology, we might say, of watching the movie. I have decided to focus on both routes.

Anyone who knows me is aware that I am a guy with a (fairly) even keel. I can count on one hand the movies that have actually made me shed a tear. And even then, it is usually one tear, perhaps two. But last night during the finale of United 93, my face was wet, and it took a tremendous effort of will not to lose my composure completely. This result was the culmination of experiencing a film that literally had a physical effect on me. I know no other way to describe it. There were moments in the movie when my body physically shook and my stomach rolled itself into knots. At the halfway point I got a painful headache in the front of my head. I'm not sure if it was due to the incredible and harrowing sense of tension the first half of the movie builds, but I would say it's possible. Walking out of the theater afterwards I was speechless. I felt as if I was in a state of mild shock. I felt physically exhausted, and I had trouble keeping my mind on the road as we drove home.

Now if you think this sort of reaction is silly or overemotional, you could certainly be right. But my point is that I am rarely moved in this way, especially by a Hollywood film. I love movies, but I am also aware that 99% of the sewage that Hollywood spews out is worthless. So you could say I'm a bit jaded about the movie industry. The fact, however, is that United 93 is a masterstroke of cinema, a film of coarse emotional power and authentic human drama. It is, at its heart, a tragic story, not in the sense of a classical tragedy, of course, but in the sense of being deep down a very sad story, a story of ordinary people forced against their wills into kill-or-be-killed survival mode.

As for the quality of the movie itself, I only have a few things to say. First, the director Paul Greengrass has established himself here as one of the truly great directors working today. His refusal to dramatize, fictionalize, or otherwise romanticize the events of that infamous day does not detract from the emotional potency of the film but intensifies it. He breaks a thousand and one rules of drama and yet it is precisely this rule-breaking that works. For example, a general rule of drama is that the audience must come to care about the characters, and the only way to achieve that is that they must come to know the characters. We should know their name, their background, the events in their past that have shaped them to be the people they are today, etc. Greengrass will have none of that. In fact the characters are almost anonymous; we hardly ever hear their names, and they do not address one another by name because they do not know what those names are. I had to go to IMDB to find out who each character was. The only person recognizable by his actions is Todd Beamer, who utters the infamous ""Let's roll"" line. And yet it works. Perhaps it is because these events are still so close to our minds, but I think it is also because Greengrass goes for such a real world feel. If you saw a man on the street fighting for his life and bleeding to death, would you be less affected because you did not know his family history? It is the same here. These are real people, not superheroes or kung fu masters. They are fathers in golf shirts who are pressed into an unfathomably tragic situation.

Second, in portraying the circumstances of the hijacking and the violent rejoinder by the passengers, Greengrass uses the same technique that James Cameron did in Titanic: he portrays it all in real time. Thus from the moment the passengers board to the ill-fated finale, the audience experiences the events just as the passengers did. There are no quick cuts to represent the passage of time. The other planes hit their targets on the same schedule that they did on September 11. Just as it was in Titanic, this real-time drama is especially effective, and I have no idea why. It also gives Greengrass the chance to focus on the strategic decisions made by the warring parties on the planes. Had the terrorists made their move a few minutes earlier, the plane would have had a shorter trip to its target destination, the other planes would have hit their respective targets farther along in the timeline of the United 93 hijacking, the passengers would not have found out about the World Trade Center and the Pentagon from their relatives, and the plane would have hit its intended target in Washington. In its own way the story provides excellent examples, both good and bad, of leadership and strategic decision making.

Third, Greengrass' use of largely unknown actors is an excellent move, and the performances by the actors themselves are remarkable. Consider their task: they must portray grown men and women who are in one moment concerned with their stocks and their jobs, and in the next must choose between shedding the blood of other men or dying themselves in the process. In their faces there is above all one emotion: fear. Even as they prepare for their attack with whatever makeshift weapons they can find, there are tears in their eyes. And when they attack there is an animal fervor to their actions; it is violence which is bred from the innate will to survive. The hijackers are perhaps the most convincing of all. Other reviews have said that Greengrass makes them ""human,"" but I do not see how. They are human in that they walk upright and wear clothes, but when they begin cutting the throats of their fellow passengers I saw them as nothing but man-devils driven by a wicked and lying ideology.

The final moments of the film are unforgettable. Much has been said about the way in which Greengrass fills in the blanks of the largely unknown events, but the finale is so frenzied and chaotic it is hard to tell what is happening anyway. And yet we know exactly what is happening: men are fighting and dying as they have done for untold thousands of years, leaving behind loved ones and children and a shaken citizenry.

One final note. It occurred to me while watching the film how the person who hates religion must feel. If you are raised in a secular home with little or no religion and you view the religion-fueled actions of these young men and other terrorists like them, it must seem that religion itself is an inherently dangerous thing. But of course there is another side to the story. For if God exists, then certainly not everything done in His name is done in His will. For whatever evils are done in His name, there must also be a reckoning for those evils by God Himself, at the very least for the sin of denigrating His name and His glory. The cruelty with which religious men conduct themselves does not prove that all religion is bad, but that only some manifestations of religion is. Without the rest, there could be no proper judgment of the former.",1150934400,23,7383,4.488839285714286
1550687,2,B00005JOZI,"I listened to a long interview with Greengrass and he came across as something of a dullard. That is, he had nothing of great import to say about his chosen subject and expected us belatedly to do the work. The result is of questionable merit. After 9/11, the need to compile and endlessly replay Twin Towers footage from every conceivable angle struck me as almost getting off on the spectacle. Likewise here, ""Roll up! Roll up! Dare yourself to climb aboard the United 93 Rollercoaster ride of a lifetime! You'll ""ooh"", you'll ""aagh"" and leave covered in sweat and tears with your stomach in your throat!"" The 'movie movie' type thriller music, especially when the second plane impacts is a dead giveaway in this regard. Since the purpose of 9/11 was to create terror in the civilian population, it seems wilfully perverse to allow oneself to be terrorized a second time, doing their work for them. It is giving them the 'oxygen of publicity' as Maggie Thatcher once put it. I'm not saying it was made purely for reasons of venality. Few films make money and this was definately a hard sell. Nevertheless, I suspect many will be going for the visceral experience alone, rather than for anything edifying (which is, in any case, not there) and must be counted as something of an own goal by the West.

I was also minded of 'Hookey' in 'Zulu', whose descendants were offended by the wholly unjustified portrayal of him as a malingerer at Rorke's Drift. A passenger had his life cruelly cut short by terrorists on board United 93.  Was it neccessary to besmerch his memory as a collaborator, and on what evidence? That was really disgraceful.",1150675200,8,1641,4.734265734265734
1550688,5,B00005JOZI,"In United 93, director Paul Greengrass has made this year's best film to date. Come to think of it, this film will be remembered in years to come as a classic and deservedly so.
The film tells the story of the plane that was hijacked along with three others on 9/11. Unlike the other planes, United 93 did not hit its intended target because of the courageous action of its passengers and surviving crew. Instead it crashed into a field, killing all on board, after the passengers staged a mid air revolt against their captors and stormed the cockpit, to try and gain control of the plane from the hijackers.

Greengrass approaches his subject with a neutral and restrained manner. He recreates the Air Traffic Control on the day and it is populated by working people who are just going about their business amid the hubbub of a normal day at the office. Tragically this routine is disrupted by first one plane, and then another, followed by another going incommunicado and disappearing off the radar screens. Speculation and confusion is rife at this point, and then the impacts on the Twin Towers occur, and oh so slowly the realisation dawns among this workforce that today is a day unlike no other. No attempt is made to airbrush away the confusion and communication failures that occurred at all levels that day whether at the FAA or military, or even higher. Instead you have a well realised vision of large numbers of people doing their best to cope with the unthinkable.

The hijackers themselves are neutrally depicted. They are nervous and eager to get on with the job in hand. Ruthless when it comes to killing people, their increasing fear of the passengers is brilliantly depicted as slowly they start to realise that the individuals that they had cowed earlier on, are becoming a cohesive unit, with the intention of fighting back.
Death is depicted in real time and it is both protracted and messy. People simply do not die quickly when stabbed or bludgeoned, and Greengrass depicts this with chilling realism.
The passengers themselves are portrayed as everyday people undergoing the routine of a flight. At the beginning, as usual no one talks to each other apart from when necessary. When the hijack kicks off, they become cowed and terrified, as the hijackers kill one of their number, plus some of the Flight Crew.
Huddling together in terror, they learn the awful truth via mobile phones as to what is going on outside. Then the stronger individuals among them stand forward and plan the fight back....
I do not know just how close this was to reality but Greengrass creates the effect of almost putting you among these people and sharing their terror. The use of hand held cameras and the grainy look to the film, give it a gritty realism which just adds to the overall viewing experience.
Be warned this is not an easy film to watch, and at times I could see other people in the audience becoming visibly uncomfortable and upset by what they were seeing on the screen. At times, I too became uncomfortable with what was being depicted.

See this film for what it is, a harrowing depiction of ordinary people trying to cope in a terrifyingly extraordinary situation.

The lasting legacy of those brave souls on United 93 is that they have served notice on future hijackers, that it is the ordinary person in the street that they now have to fear, not just the military.
Their brave action is an example to people of all religions and all backgrounds, to come together and unite against any extreme and malevolent philosophy that basically seeks the destruction of all who do not subscribe to it.

1550689,4,B00005JOZI,"""United 93"" is a difficult film to watch. Not only because of the difficult subject matter but also because of how director Paul Greengrass handles the material.

Naturally, any film depicting any part of the horror of the events of September 11, 2001 is going to be a hot button and ""United 93' is no exception. When the previews began playing in theaters, people protested and it was pulled from at least one theater in New York.

But the film is very moving and emotional. Writer and director Paul Greengrass (""Bloody Sunday"", ""The Bourne Supremacy"") deserves a lot of credit for showing restraint. We really don't `meet' any of the characters, or learn very much about them, we merely observe them and we watch as the flight crew, the passengers, the air traffic controllers, the military and the terrorists enter the story for the first time. Greengrass begins the film as the terrorists are praying, before they leave for the airport and he doesn't stop the narrative each time someone new enters the story to introduce them, provide back story, motivation or reason. In a conventional narrative film, this is mandatory and the lack of these elements would drive me mad. But in ""United 93"", Greengrass doesn't use these elements and it forces us to watch the events as if it were a documentary or we are eavesdropping. Because of this, we witness the events unfold with clearer vision, which makes it all the more difficult to watch.

Greengrass has populated the film with many less recognizable character actors; I only recognized many of the faces because I see a lot of films. He also asked a number of real life people who were involved in the events of the day to participate, allowing them to recreate their own actions. Thankfully, he chose against casting A List actors in some of the roles, allowing all of the characters to remain even and real, aiding the documentary look and feel of the film.

Naturally, it will be difficult for many people to watch ""United 93"". The director has made an emotional, powerful, restrained film which will not make it easier.

But it is an important film to watch. Maybe not today, next week or even next month. But we all need to see it, if for no other reason than to remind future generations because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.",1147737600,15,2304,4.707196029776675
1550740,4,B00005JOZI,"Two thumbs up, although I was fidgeting like a kid late for the potty much of the way through. I had watched the Discovery Channel docu-drama, The Flight That Fought Back at home, and paced the living room the whole time. Moistened up at both films, too.

My cinematic tastes are a bit old-fashioned, I guess. The herky-jerky shoulder-mounted camera work, used throughout, was effective in the action scenes, but the rest of the time it just reminded me of early MTV videos. And we didn't get any background development of the passengers, given the you-are-there POV. (The Discovery Channel's film was much more informative--and therefore poignant--because of the relatives' onscreen interviews.  The featurette in this dvd fixes that, though).

Not surprisingly, most of the acting is a series of reaction shots. The growing horror of the flight controllers as the attacks multiply is possibly the best thing about the film. That guy playing himself as the top civil aviation cheese was especially good, vis-a-vis that.

It ends too abruptly for me, with a POV shot of the plane crashing. I mentally filled in some coda scenes, like someone looking up at the sound of the crash, and seeing the mushroom cloud rising over the countryside. Or more scenes of muddle at NORAD and other ATC centers, as they try to catch up with events. Or the congressional staffers, evacuated from the Capitol, slowly realizing that the Flight 93 passengers have saved their lives. But the film instead ends along with the lives of all aboard the flight.

So, considered in a vacuum, it's a quote pretty good film unquote. Given the political climate in Hollywood, it's a near miracle. Recall, please: the first thing the film industry did after 9/11 was alter or delay all the major projects that showed Arabs as terrorists. Then they & the liberal news media got to work giving that celluloid string of lies Fahrenheit 9/11 a big launch.

The terrorists in United 93, though they are shown praying and trying to control the butterflies in their stomachs, are clearly presented as evil. There's no social commentary at all--nor any shying away from the Islam element-- unless it was woven in too symbolically for me to catch it at first viewing. It's a straightforward tale of professional people being blindsided by catastrophe, and ordinary people called to do heroic things, and sacrificing themselves in the process.

I have a feeling this film is only the beginning of what will turn into a legend, in the best senses of that word.",1147305600,,2518,4.896713615023474
1550741,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 depicts the horrific events during September 11, 2001, leading up to the crash of flight United 93, which terrorists had planned to use to demolish the U.S. Capitol building as they had the World Trade Center.

There are probably many who feel that this film is ""too soon"" or in other ways in bad taste (i.e. trying to capitalize on a tragedy). However, if we agree that a film should be made on this subject at all, this film did it correctly. There is nothing overtly ""cinematic"" about this movie--we're just shown what happened. It is not moralizing at us. It is not telling us how to feel about anything. Just showing what happened, kind of like a dramatic re-enactment.

If there is a message to the movie, it is only because the real life events themselves contained it. Perhaps the most compelling ""theme"" is how unprepared the government was to deal with this kind of a crisis--how the only people in a position to do anything at all were the passengers on the plane. One moment of dark comedy is how, with all of their technology and power, neither the military nor the FAA could figure out what the hijackers were doing until they turned on CNN and watched the coverage along with everyone else.

I imagine that some people will complain that the terrorists were not depicted as being more villainous. It is true that some of the hijackers are treated with some measure of sympathy--they are shown to be human beings. However, this is not inappropriate, as whatever else they were, the hijackers *were* human beings. We don't know, and can't know, whether any of the terrorists hesitated, as was portrayed in this movie, but it doesn't make their deeds any less heinous for it. It simply makes them more believable and realistic, which is important because that's the great strength of this movie.

United 93 is not really an enjoyable movie to watch simply because it is so sad, but it is well made and very powerful. It draws its power via the fact that it presents these still-painful events  impartially and with an open eye--that it does so realistically--and the quality of the film answers any objections I had going in as to the appropriateness of its creation.",1147132800,12,2189,4.675324675324675
1550742,5,B00005JOZI,"For weeks now we have heard the question asked, ""are people ready to see a film about 9/11?"" I laughed at the thought of the question. Of course people are ready. Did anyone ask that question during World War 2? Hollywood was turing out movies about the war left and right. Surely audiences members had loved ones fighting abroad. Did any one say, hey wait a minute, there's a war going on, people don't want to see a movie about a war. What about films such as ""Since You Went Away"" and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", two of the greatest films made dealing with how the war effected the home front. Did people shout, ""too soon!"" Of course not.

 ""United 93"" is one of the most intense, absorbing, touching, heartfelt movie going experiences I have had all year. No movie has touched me in such a profound way since ""The Passion of the Christ"". ""United 93"" is more than a movie. It transends comments such as ""best film of the year"". It is above that.

 It should be pointless to go over plot description, so let me discuss my reaction to the film. First of all the movie makes no moral judgements. All the movie does, similar to a documentary, is show us what happened and allow us to come up with our own thoughts. We don't need to be told what happened on September 11th was bad. We don't need to be told the people who hijacked these planes were evil. So the movies doesn't feel any need to state the obvious.

 But, ""United 93"" does raise some questions, only I'm not sure we are suppose to talk about them. I don't want to make ""United 93"" sound like a political film, it doesn't have a left or right point of view, but political questions will stir in your brain as you watch the movie. For instance, if the President could have been reached, what would have changed? Why couldn't the president be reached? Why did all branches involved not know what the other was doing? If every second was vital, what does the president's famous ""seven minute"" blackout tell us? Should he have done something?

 The truly great movies make us ask questions. Not because they have plot-holes, but because we become so involved with the characters we don't want the film to end. We linger on and on about the characters and the events. ""United 93"" makes us ask a lot of questions.

 Here's one more thing to think about. Remember when ""The Passion of the Christ"" came out, and groups were afraid it was going to cause anti-Semitism? I haven't heard a word from Muslim groups afraid this film would case race riots, have you? Why is that?

 Ever since 9/11 happened people have claimed the ""united 93"" flight was American propaganda. I don't know enough about the issue to decided whether or not it is or isn't, but, lets assume it is. If it is all a fake, a story the government created to inspire patriotic feelings within us, than strickly as a work of fiction the film is still powerful and emotionally involving. But a bigger question lies underneath all this. Is it okay to talk about 9/11 and ask questions? Will this film push forward a debate?

 ""United 93"" is a film everyone should see. Is it difficult to watch? Yes. I'm not going to lie to you. You may have the urge to look away, but don't. This is a gripping, emotionally draining experience that will linger in your mind long afterwards. It may even take a while for you to decided if it was good or not. But that's okay. See the movie, think it over, and most importantly, ask questions.

 Bottom-line: The year's most emotionally draining, heartfelt, intense,and absorbing films I have seen since ""The Passion of the Christ"". I look at this work of art and feel it is more than a movie. It should be seen by everyone.",1147046400,11,3675,4.446428571428571
1550743,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 is an incredible reenactment of September 11, 2001 focusing mainly on United Flight 93 and the efforts by its passengers to take back the plane from the hijackers. This movie had my heart pounding, my nerves pulsing, and my body sweating. It takes the viewer on a journey aboard the flight that was supposed to be part of an attack on Washington D.C. but that was thwarted by several brave passengers, thereby saving potentially thousands of lives and millions of dollars in damage.

Everyone already knows what took place on September 11, 2001 and anyone who doesn't know can quickly look up facts on the internet or in printed form. The fate of United Flight 93 is already well known and for that reason, I wondered if this movie would be able to keep my attention for very long. I knew about this movie several weeks before its release and I was skeptical about its ability to accurately portray the events and to give the viewer a realistic feel for what happened during this flight. Everyone already knows the outcome, I reasoned, so how suspenseful could it possibly be?

Well, I am here to tell you that United 93 is an incredibly suspenseful, scary, heart- pounding movie that ranks among the most dramatic I have ever witnessed. It accomplishes this in spite of the fact that you already know how it will end, and the bulk of the credit goes to director and writer Paul Greengrass for making this possible. He has produced a movie about the United 93 flight that is realistic in every way and so emotionally draining and pulse- pumping it should be approached with caution by anyone who has a history of heart problems.

I love many things about this movie and the most important among them is the action and emotional factors. The movie starts off on an easy pace and the action at first is only lukewarm. But then, the North World Trade Center Tower gets hit by a plane, causing a reaction of disbelief on the part of the Air Traffic Controllers. The word ""hijack"" gets tossed around, but no one can believe it. There hasn't been a hijacking in the United States in decades and it seems too unreal to accept as fact. But then, the second tower gets hit and then the Pentagon. At this point, the action on the screen is furious, with Air Traffic Controllers talking non- stop on phones, officials watching the planes paths on radar, and everyone wondering what to do next. Then, the scene switches to United 93 and its relatively quiet passengers who are chatting back and forth about things in the news, things taking place at their homes, and so on. It's nothing but ordinary chitchat. That is, until the hijackers race to the front of the plane, open the cockpit doors, and attack the pilots. From this point on, the movie is a depiction of sheer terror as the passengers get tossed back and forth, the hijackers stab more victims, and a few of the men join together and rush the cockpit in an effort to regain control of the plane.

Another thing I love about this movie is the way it is scripted. Paul Greengrass presents a script in United 93 that is very real. It doesn't contain snappy statements, amusing quips, memorable quotations, a catchy soundtrack of classic rock and roll tunes, or anything else one would expect from a big Hollywood production. Instead, the actors and actresses in this movie talk in the actual manner one would expect them to talk to each other. In other words, the little conversation that exists is typical of what people talk about each day on the job (in the case of the flight members, crew, and Air Traffic Controllers) or in the presence of strangers (in the case of the passengers on the plane). It's almost like Greengrass set the stage, told everyone about the events that took place during the actual United Flight 93, turned on his camera, and let everyone be themselves for the next 111 minutes. Everyone talks in a completely normal way, and this adds tremendously to the film's appeal. It seems so real it's frightening.

The emotional appeal of this movie is another strong point and I cannot imagine anyone leaving the theater without feeling shaken in some way. You feel like you're right there with the hijackers. You feel angry at these crazy lunatics who want to kill all of these innocent lives. You feel the suspense as the moment draws near for the passengers to fight back. You feel anxiety and grief as you wonder what must be going on back home as different passengers call their families to tell them they are not likely to ever see them again. And you feel a sense of outrage over the lack of decisive leadership action from the FAA and other government agencies.

One unusual thing about this movie is that it doesn't include any well- known Hollywood leading men or women. I recognized only one of the stars of this movie: David Alan Basche, who I can recall playing a part in the movie ""War of the Worlds"". And even he isn't very well known. I'm not sure why the Greengrass decided to leave out the big names, but I'm glad he did because casting the film with lesser- known actors and actresses makes it seem that much more realistic. They seem like ordinary men and women going about an ordinary day that eventually turned into the most hellish day of the lives. And because the action itself is so gripping, I had a hard time even remembering the names of the characters. Usually, I have a good roadmap in my mind when I watch a movie that accurately organzies the character names and the actors/actresses who played them for future reference. But this movie was so intense with its heart- pouding action that I completely lost track of who was who.

One other surprise with this film is that it doesn't attempt to make any brash judgments or any strong political statements. I watched and listened closely to see if there would be any negative statements about different ethnic groups of people, different religions, etc., etc., but there were none. It would have been very tempting with this type of movie to include scenes with the passengers and/or the Air Traffic Controllers going off on a hateful rant over different ethnic groups or different religions but Greengrass resists. He also resists the temptation to blame anyone specifically or to indict any one group as responsible. He does point out the failures of the FAA, but this is honest truth and Greengrass doesn't try to sugarcoat the situation. But he also resists the temptation to demonize the FAA, choosing instead to just point out the inadequacies and move on.

Because of the hectic pace of this film, there is a large amount of shaky camera work. The scenes move at a fast clip and the camera has a difficult time keeping up with everything. This is especially true aboard United Flight 93 and as the big moment approaches and the passengers decide to fight back, the camera goes all over the place. Here, some might find this a little bit sloppy and if it were most other movies, I would criticize it for this reason. But here, Paul Greengrass got it right once again. He wanted to depict the scenes exactly the way they would have been witnessed by someone aboard the plane. With all the chaos taking place, the sudden descents, and the rollover of the plane in the sky, the scene wouldn't have been smooth in any person's eyes. It would have been a jumbled mess of action, and that is exactly the way it is shown in this movie.

It has been almost five years since the attacks of September 11, 2001. It is a day that will never, ever, be forgotten as thousands lost their lives in these terrorist attacks. But we can all stand proud and remember the brave men who fought back against the terrorists on United Flight 93. They didn't stop the plane from crashing and they didn't save the lives of anyone on board. But they prevented much greater loss of life and property by taking action at a crucial moment. This movie, United 93, is an excellent film that everyone should see. It accurately depicts the drama, the fear, the anxiety, and the sheer madness that was taking place in the skies on September 11, 2001 in a way that is emotionally exhausting and realistic to the extreme. We all know what takes place, but United 93 still keeps you solidly in its grip from start to finish. It's an incredible movie!",1147046400,14,8275,4.600948509485095
1550744,5,B00005JOZI,"I didn't see myself as the type of person who would cry at the end of this film, but I couldn't help myself. I felt that United 93 was a pretty accurate depiction of the chaos and confusion that surrounded everyone that day.

Even from Minnesota, the effects of the hijackers could be seen just by looking at Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport. I drive past it daily, and that day I distinctly remember not seeing a plane in the air anywhere by the afternoon. The quiet skies were a very eery sight and left me with an uneasy stomache.

It shows the chaos of communication in the flight towers and the military intsallations, and how truly unprepared we were for this type of attack.

As I left the theater, I asked my fiance ""What would you have done if you were on that plane?"" and I believe that we both would have done what the passengers of United 93 did.

This film brought back everything I remembered about that day and more. United 93 is a tribute to the passengers who, as some say, won the first battle in the war on terror.",1147046400,9,1029,4.34375
1550745,5,B00005JOZI,"When one thinks of September 11, 2001, one usually thinks of the War on Terror that it helped spawn.  But the politics of 9/11's aftermath are just one aspect of it, and it is something that writer/director Paul Greengrass (THE BOURNE SUPREMACY) has chosen to sidestep in favor of a gut-wrenching, humanistic approach in his film UNITED 93.

United Airlines Flight 93, enroute from Newark to San Francisco on that fateful morning, was the only one of the four hijacked planes that didn't reach its intended target (which, as the film shows, was most likely the U.S. Capitol Building).  This is because the passengers onboard, knowing already that two planes had nailed the World Trade Center and a third had taken out the southwest corner of the Pentagon, quickly formulated a plan to try and take back control of the aircraft from the four Islamist terrorists who had taken it over.  Although their attempt to regain control of the aircraft was doomed to end in a field sixty miles outside of Pittsburgh, their actions saved untold thousands of lives in the nation's capitol.

Utilizing a docudrama approach via hand-held cameras, as well as razor-sharp editing, Greengrass, working with a cast of largely unknown actors plus some of the very civilian air traffic and military personnel who were there on that terrible day, made UNITED 93 an intense experience, but one that avoids political grandstanding.  This film is about people, pure and simple--from the people in the civilian and military air trafic control centers faced with a thoroughly impossible situation, to the fanatical hijackers, to the passengers who were determined to stop them.

Of course, there are well-reasoned arguments against UNITED 93, that it is too soon for a 9/11-related film to be released now (though maybe FAHRENHEIT 9/11 slipped everyboody's mind).  But exactly when WOULD be the right time?  After all, films about the 1978 Jonestown tragedy and the 1976 Entebbe incident were both made within 18-24 months of those events.  Besides, UNITED 93 is never exploitational--violent, yes, and unavoidably so, but definitely never exploitational.  It is a film to be commended for being a deep human interest story of the highest order, and Greengrass, his cast, and his crew are to be commended for their extremely laudable efforts here.",1146960000,4,2320,5.078947368421052
1550746,2,B00005JOZI,"Seen this movie this past saturday with my folks- and I must say it wasn't all that.

The best part of this movie is that it is a lasting tribute too the 9/11 victems.

So in a nut shell - The day starts out as any ordenery day @ the airport,and air traffic control.

Adventually flight 93 passangers find out whats going on-and a hand full of passangers and sturtess revolt against there captors. You know the rest.

I recommend this movie to any and all who wish to see the very best and worst of our increasingly troubled world.",1146960000,13,436,4.662337662337662
1550748,5,B00005JOZI,"I happened to see this film in Paris, with a largely Muslim audience. My esteem for Paul Greengrass as a director and writer is so profoundly deep that I can give you no other recommendation than that even those superficially unsympathetic to the colonial bravado of the present US regime were moved to stunned silence and mute weeping.

Greengrass is the finest political docu=drama film maker since Nikos Costa-Gavres, whose increasingly accurate portrayals of what may have gone on behind the scenes of political murder made him a target in his own Greece, as well as Pinochet's Chile and Nixon's Amerika. Greengrass has distinguished himself as a first rate film director, and especially as an unflinching witness to truth with his remarkable BLOODY SUNDAY,  the very best film about what started all the bloodshed in the latter half of the 20th Century in Northern Ireland. That film upset all the guilty parties: IRA, UVF, Sinn Fein, DUP, the Brits. Innocent people were gunned down in the name of religio-political extremism. No less an authority on such matters as Jesus Christ himself warned that religion and politics don't mix. At all. Ever. He paid for refusing to politically galvanize his followers to the will of either the Pharisees, the Sanhedrin or the Romans with his life, and the world's been bollixed since.

In the case of 9/11, disenfranchisement led to the usurpation of religious devotion to further an extreme fanaticism, whose motives as practiced in Afghanistan were extremely less than pure. Innocent people board a plane to go to work, go home, go visit, as uninvolved with the circumstances that led to the grievances as any group of people could be. Within minutes, at the scene of mid-air murder, they were ushered to the threshold of the ultimate ethical choice. Socrates could not have imagined a more profound moment. Men and women of the crew lay dead or dying, their throats slashed. Word had come to the passengers that they were being abducted to further more carnage as had already visited a couple of thousand busboys, waiters, potwashers, cops, firemen in NY. Their response went beyond mere heroism. To give up one's life to prevent many others from dying innocently is a sacrifice of such profound reverence that all the politics on either side of this issue are humbled.

Greengrass takes raw material from various accounts and in his cinema-verite, real time style crafts the movement of courage and reverence as it rises to the task at hand. There is definitely a second hijacking going on here as well, and the Muslim actors who portray the villains do so without pandering to stereotype. And maybe that is what rattled the crowd in Paris. It must have struck the audience that how and why religious tenets that were at one point meant to direct the human spirit to the contemplation of the more essential Being could be pornographically corrupted to contemplate and execute mass murder is cause for profound sorrow. And that's as true for Islam as it is for Judaism, Christianity and Hinduism. I'll give the Buddhists a walk on this as they seem to have gotten the point of non-violence.

In Greengrass's film, there is cause for tears and cause for admiration. It is painful to see the recognition of the fate before them among villains and heroes alike. That life should come to these choices is tragedy for Humanity, not just a nation or a cause.

Where is the solution? As one Muslim gentleman said to me on the way out, if these passengers could find the courage to revere life and make the ethical choice, can not we also find the courage to make the ethical choice to meet and resolve our differences. Of course, years ago, this very man had authored a song called ""Peace Train.""

1550809,5,B00005JOZI,"It is by far the most intense movie I have ever seen. It's not intese because of gore (even though there is some), it's just an emotionally tense movie. The movie was so intense and you feel so involved, that I walked out of the theatre and promptly puked in the parking lot on the way to my car. Hell my gut is still in knots and it's been an hour.

The Chaos, knowing that alot of the FAA people and Air Traffic Control guys played themselves was stunning. Took me right back to watching everything happen on CNN and then locking the base down.

It's amazing to say that because you know what happend. I mean I watched the documentarys, watched and read the news when everything happend, You know where this is going.

I don't cry in movies but this one was tough. Some dyed in the wool true hero stuff.

The hardest thing about this movie is the creshendo. You are ramping up to the climax of this movie for 2 hours. The is no Denumot. The movie ends. It's cinematically excellent. But you walk away like you took a hard right to the jaw. Just like what happend 5 years ago.

1550810,5,B00005JOZI,"""United 93"" is the first major motion picture to be released since 9/11 to deal with the events of that day.  Focusing on the plane that did not reach its target, the film moves in almost real time from take off to the crash landing in Pennsylvania.  Writer-Director Paul Greengrass has taken pains to be as accurate as possible, and when the story veers into the unknown, the story told is very plausible.

The actors are mostly unknowns, preventing any one person from distracting the viewer from the story.  This was a wise choice by Greengrass, and is successful in keeping the viewer focused on the story.  The actors all do good jobs, even though none are developed excessively.  This, combined with the hand held camera work gives the film a more intimate feel, as if you are there among them on the plane.  Greengrass received 100% support from the families, and a substantial number of the people on the ground play themselves in the movie.  That alone should speak of the quality of the film.

""United 93"" is a tense, gut-wrenching movie of a group of people and their determination to stop four evil men who wanted to bring America to its knees.  Is it too soon?  I say no...it is never to soon to remember the heroic things that that the passengers did.  They should be remembered and honored as heros.  ""United 93"" does just that.

It really wasn't that violent, and the ""F"" word was said a few times, but other than that I thought maybe PG-13 but not ""R"". Kids may be bored by all the grown-up confusion at the beginning in the control tower, Norad etc. I took my 9 year old to see it because she liked the TV version so much. I would have liked to have seen more character development, like the one they showed on TV that had both sides of the phone conversation the passengers had with those at home. But all in all this was a good movie that of course made me cry at the end.

The hijackers are not portrayed as brave or noble,just as the misguided cowards they are. I also like the fact that the cast was just a bunch of ordinary people-nothing glamorous! Which is awesome because that is what they were-regular people like you and me.",1146873600,9,881,4.244047619047619
1550814,5,B00005JOZI,"All I can say about United 93 is ""Wow.""  If you're like me, you may be very hesitant to see it at first,  thinking that this is an inhuman attempt to cash in on a tragedy.  However, after visiting the web site for the film, you'll see that this film was made with the full support of the families.  As for Paul Greengrass, the film's director, the interviews with him about this film are telling.  It's very clear that he handled this project seriously and with extreme care.

What's truly great about this film is that it painstakingly re-creates the tragedy of that day without getting political.  The story itself focuses, like a laser beam, upon ordinary people: passengers, flight attendants, air traffic controllors, etc.  Politicians (of all political parties) are simply absent from this portion of 9/11.

This film is not about politics- it's about those brave souls who were closest to this worst day in American history.

There's no agenda here. It simply tells what happens, and in so doing, forces us to reflect upon certain questions.  Are we any safer today?  How can we really know for sure?  Will there be a day in America's future that will be worse than this?  The plane was highjacked by Al-Queada operatives, and there are Al-Queada in Iraq right now where we fight.  So is the war in Iraq justified?

These  are the questions that will haunt you after this film is over.  Seeing young men who are willing to commit suicide for what they believe in, and ordinary Americans willing to stop them,  raises questions about American resolve.  Is America made of the same stuff that the heroes of United 93 were made of?  Will we fight the terrorists with the same determination that they fight us?

We can, and have had considerable debate about how best to stop another 9/11 from happening again.  But the question still haunts us: are we doing enough?  I saw the film last night, and that's the question that gnaws at me right now more than anything else.

Most of the key players that dealt with this disaster from the control towers in Boston, New York and Virginia are staring in this film playing themselves. The human trauma experienced on that day was successfully captured on screen through some very chilling and outstanding performances that will undoubtedly provoke a visceral feeling of anger, rage and resolve in everyone that sees this film.

This movie should be shown in every single theater in the Middle East. People there need to see what their condonation of religious fanatics and ideologies have caused us all. Alas, the country that needs to see this most (i.e. Saudi Arabia) has a ban on movie theaters.

1550817,5,B00005JOZI,"I was just going to write a review of United 93 praising the work of Paul Greengrass in presenting this story with great intelligence and sensitivity.  His choices throughout the film are exceptionally astute and the film is gripping, terrifying and sad.  There is a feeling of numbing dread in the early scenes of the passengers boarding the flight alongside the hijackers that is excruciating.  Normal people, going about their lives, unaware of the terror we know is about to befall them.

As I said, I applaud the choices the film-makers have made, and this is a fine film that should be seen by many.  I found it stunning.

I likewise find stunning several of the jaw-dropping one star reviews I have just read here, motivated by and pumped full of their ridiculous and absurd conspiracy theories.  I was equally dismayed to see how many positive votes this rubbish has received.  Not only are these mental cases ill-informed, but their insensitivity to the families of the people who died on this flight in spewing their deranged crackpot views into this public forum is beyond bad taste.  I imagine they are likewise,  beyond shame.",1146787200,16,1139,4.8549222797927465
1550818,5,B00005JOZI,"The main reason I've decided to see this film is because as a Muslim I wanted to see how they portrayed the villans.  I also read of some anti-Muslim backlash after people have seen this film.  Its semi-documentary style reminds me of the classic ""The Day of the Jackel"" based on the book by Frederick Forsyth.

From the opening to the very end, I was filled with tension like I've rarely felt while watching any movie.  The movie opens with one of the hijackers reading the Quraan in a hotel room.  They didn't translate what he read, but the verse he read had something to do with the believers being rewarded in the afterlife.  All of the terrorists were making du'ah (supplications) throughout the film and these were authentic du'ah read in Arabic.  Some of the du'ah was translated.  I got the imprssion that all of the terrorists were very real and they truely believed that they would die as shihadis (martyrs).  All of the actors were real Arab Muslims who knew Islam, which made it shockingly authentic.  Even the people in the air traffic control centers looked and acted real.  They didn't appear to be supermen or a bunch of geniuses, but human beings who are prone to make mistakes and overlook things.  It appeared as if they did all that they could do given the circumstances.

The troubling thing about this film is that I have no reason to complain about a negative portrayal of Islam or Muslims, because by all accounts this is mostly how things happened that day.  At the same time however, I really wish people would watch films like this with an open mind and not assume all Muslims are like the ones depicted in this film.  Interestningly, all of the terrorists except for the pilot spoke exclusively in Arabic (much of which was not translated) even to say things such as ""shut up"" or ""come here"".  I think this adds shock value because most of the people don't care what they were saying and it makes it easier for the audience to associate the Arabic Language with evil.

You shouldn't associate the Arabic language, Islam, Muslim prayers and all Arabs with terrorism.  It seems like an idle comment but apparently ignorance and stupidity still abounds.",1146787200,23,2179,4.659685863874346
1550899,5,B00005JOZI,"After 58 reviews, it's hard to add anything new, so I'll be brief.

It took me an hour to disconnect from this movie after it ended.  I'm not a fan of the ""handheld camera"" technique, so it took me a while to adjust to it.  However, the technique worked well inside the plane.  Anything else might have seemed less real, more Hollywood.

As another reviewer noted, it would have been nice to have seen some reactions from people on the ground receiving calls from their loved ones trapped in the doomed plane.  It's probaby impossible to imagine going about your day and then getting such a call.  Maybe it's too intense and was not included for that reason.  I also expected some scenes of the people who leapt to their deaths from the towers rather than be burned alive.  Afterward, I was glad the movie didn't show pregnant women smashing into the pavement far below.

Putting aside those issues, this is a ""must see"" movie.  People need a reminder that our Islamofascist enemies cannot be bargained with.  They have and will continue sawing off the heads of anyone, even another Muslim, who doesn't completely submit to their version of Islam.  For them, it's 100% their way or no way.  No negotiation is possible.  No middle ground exists.  And they are not afraid to die in the process of killing you, your kids, your loved ones, your friends, and everything else in the world, including ideas, that they don't accept.

If you think the US brought this attack upon itself, explain what the US did to bring similar attacks upon the Russians, the Buddhists, and the Hindus.  The modus operandi is clear, as UNITED 93 reminds us.  The terrorists weren't conflicted about who their enemy was and what they were doing.

When the time for action came, neither were the passengers.  In their own, brave way, they were leaders then and still are now.

I was on the edge of my seat all through the movie and at times really felt I was there. The camera movements can and will make people dizzy but you get used to it fast. The main characters were hardly introduced and not dwelled upon like you would think or read about. Some are portayed not to have helped in the revolt but all were certainly heros to have endured the horror that unfolded. I felt at times wanting to jump up and go after the cowardly hijackers but then remembered I was just an observer. Everyone should see this movie and it's not too early to tell the story. As powerful as anything as I've seen in the last 20 years and if you are not moved by this you could be all dead inside.",1146700800,15,830,4.226415094339623
1550901,5,B00005JOZI,"By themselves, courage and intelligence are not so rare. But to see these two qualities combined is inspirational and reminds me of what good leadership is all about: taking the best course of action under difficult and frightening circumstances. Even after the passengers of United 93 had learned about the Twin Towers, it would have been ""easy"" for them to sit it out and hope for a different outcome - a safe landing, hostage negotiations. Fearful hope can be blind, but enough of the passengers were not blinded. They not only faced the terrible truth; they acted on it. It is this kind of courage and intelligence that makes me proud not just to be an American, but to be a human being. I can't imagine a better tribute to the passengers of United 93 and to all the other victims on that tragic day.

More to the film itself, this is an excellent production done with good judgment and finesse. I am glad that we didn't wait twenty years or longer to make it.",1146614400,,964,4.508571428571429
1550902,5,B00005JOZI,"I had such mixed feelings when I heard a film was being made about one of the September 11th 2001 crashes.  Someone was making a film about United Flight 93, the plane that had been forced into a nosedive in a Pennsylvania field by a fundamentalist terrorist, killing all aboard.  Had it really been almost five years?  Was America ready for this?  Was I?!  I debated the ethics of making a movie--and of my going to see it.  So many of the things in our lives are already edited and distilled down to 2 hours.  I'd been trying to forget about this.

But Flight 93 shouldn't be forgotten.  Too much changed on that day.  My bubble broke, the world came pouring in.  Always so eager to be united in Freedom and Liberty, we Americans were all bound in sorrow.  So, when the film opened a few days ago in my town, I went. I watched, knowing if I thought it was exploitative or over the top, I could always tell others to pass.

As a skeptic always on the alert for the Big Rip Off, I didn't see anything that reeked of profiting off the victims or trying to edit a tragic event down to a 2-hour ""special"".  I was surprised to find that part of the profits go to a fund for surviving family members of crew and passengers who died that day.  There are no easy answers in this film.

The passengers, crew, air traffic controllers, officials, families of passengers and crew on Flight 93 are portrayed with dignity.  The difficult task of portraying the terrorists, full of hatred for the society in which they'd lived for years and months was sobering and well acted.  It appears that the director went through serious lengths to make this appear as true to fact as the actual events happened, and to try to keep things realistic without overdramatizing or allowing (bad) overacting.  No mean feat as the only records there are to give an idea of exactly what happened on Flight 93 are the recollections of people who received calls from some of those aboard Flight 93, partial recordings from cell phones, air fones, recorded radio and the data recorder information.  The situations shown are plausable and based on existant evidence.

If you remember that day, it will be emotionally draining (I know, duh).  You'll remember where you were, what you were doing.  You will wish you could somehow get up there onscreen and help.  It is natural and easy to empathize with these people, they were ours.  The passengers and crew are a cross section of America--common folks like us, on their way to somewhere.  This is a tribute to ingenuity, fighting spirit, and human decency.  A not so subtle reminder on the rigors of vigilance.

Loud moments, violence, profanity, otherwise scary stuff, so use your good judgement if bringing (preferably older) children.",1146614400,16,2751,4.628099173553719

I did, however, have a sense of curiosity, both towards the film and the reaction of the audience.  I finally broke down and saw the film tonight, and was pleasently shocked.  The film is done in the very best of taste, and, despite everything everyone is saying about this film both good and bad, is absolutely stunning and uncompromising from start to finish.

1550905,5,B00005JOZI,"Paul Greengrass's United 93 is a must see film.  It pulls no punches.  The Islamic nihilists are clearly shown to be evil.  The four young men who hijack the flight hate us and everything we stand for.  They are true believers who readily rationalize the brutal slaughter of innocents.  Slashing the throats of the so-called nonbelievers is totally justified in their way of looking at the world.  And no, they are not particularly unique. Millions of Muslims also agree with them.  Do they represent the majority?  There are roughly 1.2 billion believers of Islam residing on this planet.  Even a small percentage of this total is enough to cause great concern.

We, of course, already know much of the story before we enter the theater.  The tragic end is not a mystery.  Nonetheless, Greenglass's creation keeps our eyes glued to the screen.  I don't recall even hearing a pin drop.  Around three initially noisy teenagers sat in front of me.  They never uttered a word during the movie.  Needless to add, United 93 is not escapist entertainment.  The passengers are doomed---and they did nothing whatsoever to place themselves in such a predicament.  It was merely the luck of the draw.  Ultimately, a number of the passengers bravely attempt to recapture the plane.  If nothing else, we now know they likely saved our nation's capitol.  I will be blunt.  Do you plan on voting in November?  If so, you are perhaps even morally obligated to view United 93.  The stakes are too high to trust the safety of the American citizenry to elected officials who fail to truly comprehend the threat of the radical Muslims.  Small children should not see United 93.  Anyone over the age of 12, however, should definitely do so.  I plan on purchasing a DVD copy.  United 93 should be seen on at least a yearly basis.  We must never forget what occurred on September 11, 2001.  Sadly, the war on terror is not going away anytime in the near future.

1550906,4,B00005JOZI,"I'm not even remotely interested in discussing all the controversy surrounding this films with regards appropriateness or accuracy or whatever, so I'm not going to.  I'm  gonna look at this as just a film, which seems appropriate enough, considering that that's what it is.

As pretty much everyone has mentions, `United 93' manages to avoid pretty much all of the obvious potential  faults it could've had.  Realism is always of the utmost importance, and Greengrass doesn't sentimentalize the situation, and most significantly, the film is devoid of any apparent commentary or moral and simply presents the events flatly, assuming that they will speak for themselves.  I think Greengrass gets perhaps a bit too much credit for his straightforward presentation.  As far as I'm concerned this approach is a bare minimum requirement for the film to be any good at all.  Still, consider this requirement met.

`United 93' is essentially two films in one, one excellent, the other okay.  These divisions come between the scenes actually on and involving United 93, and the scenes involving the FAA and air traffic controllers on the ground.  I'm less fond of the scenes on the ground, as they eventually prove to be somewhat dull and repetitive, because they consist of little more than a large number of people talking with one another, trying to figure out precisely what is going on and how to deal with it and so on.  I don't doubt that they're extremely accurate, and they are necessary to the film as a whole, seeing as how there just isn't enough going on in United 93 for it to carry a feature length film, but we definitely didn't need as much of this as we got.  Certainly, these scenes are sharply and professionally done, but there just isn't that much to them.

The scenes on the plane itself are far better, though they too could probably stand to be trimmed ever so slightly.  Obviously, there's going to be an enormous amount of conjecture going on in these parts of the film, but it always feels extraordinarily real.  Greengrass does a particularly good job with the terrorists, not portraying them as utterly inhuman monsters, but not falsely trying to excuse their behavior.  The passengers themselves are realistically devoid of characterization--  There wouldn't have been any time for them to really get to know each other, so we see simply see them on the surface, identifying them by little more than their faces.

Greengrass uses `documentary-style' filmmaking, meaning lotsa of wobbly, handheld camerawork to go along with some frantic editing in the confrontational scenes.  This is always a dangerous tactic cause if you do it poorly it's incredibly obnoxious, and makes the film utterly unbelievable. (i.e. Scenes shot this way often degenerate into a random juxtaposition of images with no comprehensible relation, and thus become totally cinematic and thus utterly unrealistic, on top of being just as annoying as hell.)  Fortunately, this method is used better here than in perhaps anything else I've seen, as it generates a real sense of chaos and claustrophobia while still remaining fairly easy to tell what's going on.  At it's best, particularly during the initial overthrow and the final rebellion, the film generates a sort of bleak, horrific intensity that has rarely been matched else where.  Of course, it's only operating at it's highest level in a few scenes, since most of the scenes on the plane are in anticipation of the conflict, but these other scenes are more eventful than one might anticipate, and the whole film is effectively suffused with a sense of dread and impending doom.  (One which, I believe, would still be there even if we didn't already know the outcome.)

Frankly, I don't buy the assertion of so many reviewers and viewers that this is an `important' film.  How so?  To remind us or convince us that 9/11 was a very bad thing?  I must say, I already thought that.  Still, this is an intense, often fairly moving and very professionally made film that shows the potential of more realistic, less stylized and conventionalized form of cinema. Again, it could stand a few trims that would then heighten the impact, but what is here is certainly effective enough as it is.

1550907,4,B00005JOZI,"Where was I on September 11, 2001? Where was I as America was under attack?  I was sleeping. I got a frantic call from my big sister, and when I turned on the TV to see what happened all I got was static.  I lived eight miles away from ground zero and I felt cut off from the world.  As I finally found a channel on the TV that worked I saw the Twin Towers fall on live.  I didn't hear any explosions, I just saw a picture of two giant buildings falling.  I saw smoke rise as I drove to work later that afternoon.  The world had forever changed, but except for the pictures of anguish and shots of buildings falling down  I heard no explosive sounds from my vantage point.  Do you remember a sound?  Except if you were in lower Manhattan probably not.

UNITED 93 is a film about an isolated moment in the middle of extreme chaos.  It's about mundane people living their mundane lives thrust into the most horrifying event in modern history.  It's a film about what a true hero is.  It's about evil men whose true cowardice united ordinary people.  But on a deeper level it's a film about big events in life and how you very rarely hear a sound.

On September 11th 2001, four planes were hijacked.  Two hit the World Trade Center, and one hit the Pentagon.  The last plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. That plane was UNITED 93, to some it could have looked like a footnote to that horrible day.  But it became a symbol, because ordinary men and women took back the plane and gave their lives to save lives on the ground. Greenglass puts us right in the middle of this life and death drama.  We meet the hijackers, we meet the flight crew, and we meet the passengers.  We don't get to know them, but in real life do you really know who's sitting next to you?

The film watches as people get ready for takeoff, as tower officials look at the skies on computer monitors. We check in with the FAA, the military, and we see that on September 11th life was pretty normal.  Then we watch helplessly as every one of these people is thrown into a tailspin when a plane disappears off a computer monitor.  We watch as a tiny green blip just disappears.  That flight hit the North Tower and it had just begun.

What Greenglass wisely does is not focus on the carnage.  We don't even see the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and when the second one finally does there is not a big explosion.  We see it on a TV, with the CNN tickertape moving slowly by.  We see smoke, but we see no carnage.  Only Silence.  In a more conventional film we would probably see every explosion, but even as United 93 hits the ground we hear nothing, only silence. Because for the most part things only blow up in the movies.

This device works well.  It makes UNITED 93 feel real.  The people feel real.  The action feels real.  I liken it to watching a home movie.  United 93 is so simple and effective I almost looked for the time and date stamps in the corner of the screen.  It's natural and raw.  That's why it is so effective and that's why it needed to be made now.

September 11th's history is still being written.  As we get further and further from it  a romantic version of these events will begin to unfold.  You want proof check out a World War II film made in the 40's and compare it to PEARL HARBOR.  UNITED 93 is a film that's effectiveness will be felt 50 years from now when that generations Michael Bay decides to make a silly film about a girl and a guy who find love on the 65 floor of the trade center as they fall.  But in the here and now UNITED 93 will stand as a record of Hero's who saved the day, of the confusion that overtook us all, and of the raw power of real life.",1146441600,14,3679,4.194285714285714

From that moment, my view of the world had changed for ever. I was quite relieved to see that this movie did not try to politicize the issue and just narrated the events faithfully, without any agenda. The footage was raw and poignant. Greengrass did not try to tone down the barbarism of the highjackers who cheered when they learned that ""their brothers had hit their targets"". We also get a glimpse of the terror that the passengers had to live through and overcome. The movie gives due credit to Thom Burnett's composure, heroism and leadership. A bunch of every day Americans who have been put together on this doomed flight and decided they would not go down without a fight. The movie was very well done, with very little background music and some real footage of the events. I was so shaken when it ended that I sat throughout the end credits, unable to move.

1550961,4,B00005JOZI,"The Left fears this movie.

United 93 is a well crafted, well edited, exciting and moving motion picture. It is 1 hour and 50 minutes long. The theater was full. Few moved. No rustling, no crunching food, no talking. Riveted. It would be a good movie even if it were a standard Hollywood fiction.

Interestingly, there were obvious extra security measures at the AMC 20-plex. Two really big guys in the outer lobby and a guy at the entrance looking to see if we had tickets for that particular film. No one has ever checked my ticket before once we entered the main entrance. What did they think was going to happen?

A few of the lines are delivered with less than thespian panache. Reading the credits, many of the ""actors"" were playing themselves--people who where there on 9/11 and remember what and how it happened. There are no overpaid pretty faces-no Leo, no Tom, no Angelina, no Julia. These are real, normal people, doing their jobs. This helps the story immeasurably. No one is identified by name. We don't know who Beamer is, we don't know the names of the pilots or the murderous terrorists. It's just like the day it happened. They, like we, didn't know anything or anyone, anymore than you would know the name of your pilot or the guy next to you on any given flight. It just happened and we were shocked. Except this time, you are a passenger on United 93.

United 93 is driven by dialog and editing. Music is barely heard until almost the very end. There are minimal, invisible special effects. No glorious computer generated crashes with Hollywood fireballs and ear splitting explosions. No impossible miracle endings. We desperately want an all-knowing, totally connected Chloe to scratch her PDA, grab a satellite and hook into the national database we (wink wink) know is there and get all the relevant, perfect information in 15 seconds...but reality's not that way. There's confusion and conflicting reports and inability to communicate clearly and get approvals and do anything fast. All we can do is watch, helplessly. Remember how it was? Staring at the TV for hours...not knowing what to do or why or even who?

My heart was beating faster from the opening scene. The sense of foreboding is palpable. When that door is closed and the passengers are locked in we know their fate is sealed. And yet, we have to watch.

Oh, and why the Left fears this movie?

Because, as a caller to Rush Limbaugh's show noted, it might just awaken the spirit of the American male. This isn't a Hollywood ""Die Hard"" with bulletproof heroes. It's history, as it happened. And as much as we wish for it, Bruce Willis's character is not on the plane. It's a sweet moment when the guys rush the first Islamic punk and take him down. It's an everyday American male's bare fist throwing the first punch. No armor, no Jack Bauer with a bag of guns. Everyday American males put the first counterattack together and carried it out knowing they were going to die. Amazing. Good on `em! As it has always been, it's the American male who lays his life down for his countrymen. It's why we live free. The left doesn't like us reminded of that.",1146355200,21,3138,4.643243243243243

Go see this movie.  Please.

Artists often are artists because they are able to focus the consumer on things they think otherwise obscure:  Mona Lisa's smile.  The moon over New Mexico.  Kane's obsessions.

What makes this film great is the absence of such manipulations. It simply...is. We - the viewers - provide the context.  Because of that, from the opening to five minutes into the closing credits - and days after - we're gripped.  Not manipulated, gripped, our perceptions our own.

Prediction: this will win best picture and best director.  Ben Sliney will get a best supporting nod, not because he was perfection but because we still, five years later, need a way to acknowledge the heroes of that day.

For the rest of the world, who believe we should remember all the victims of 9/11 every single day for the rest of our lives, do not wait any longer to see this film. There are no new revelations being told here. The movie is accurate to the letter of the information that has been previously document and memorialized of that horrific days' events. I was surprised and pleased to see that the ineptness of the FAA and nearly a decade of ambivalence towards military preparedness was accurately documented.

As much as I loved seeing the movie, it cannot go without a small degree of criticism. Though the casting was pretty good, and the movie was presented without editorializing, the filming itself was below average. The somewhat ""new-age"" technique of using a shaky hand-held camera detracts from the film. Also, the ""made for TV"" dramatization of showing close-ups, which cut off the top of the head and the neck, may indeed have a certain dramatic effect for some people, but I found it rather annoying.

Regardless of the movie's shortcomings, however, this is a must see movie. I was touched deeply by the portrayal of emotions the passengers of United 93 must surely have felt. I was also deeply touched by the theater audience. The ending of this movie, though we all know the tragic ending, will rip abruptly rip at your soul. It had the effect of leaving the entire audience in beleaguered and mournful silence.

The fact that there are those among us who want to forget the memory of 9/11, or who want to tell us it is too soon to see a movie like this, is a sad testament to the moral decay of our society and reveals the pitiful state of the very fabric upon which our country was built. Let us never forget what happened on 9/11. And let us never forget the memories of the innocent passengers of United 93, as well as flights 11, 77 and 175.  It was a day when America lost her innocence. A day we were attacked. This movie will serve a constructive reminder.

1550966,5,B00005JOZI,"""United 93"" is a taut reinactment of 9/11.  The action focuses mainly on the air traffic control towers and the one flight that managed to thwart the intentions of its hijackers.  It is good that the scope was chosen as it is. The movie is focused, but frenetic, a believable presentation of that inconceivable day.  Yet, it doesn't ignore the other aspects of 9/11 either.  Some of the actual people play themselves in the movie, and the actual footage of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon give the movie a poignant presentation.  Furthermore, the events unfold in a way that is plausible and realistic.

Why see this movie?  I wonder myself, 'Is it morbid curiosity that brings one to this film?' The answer is simple:  It documents the courage of Tod Beamer and other real heroes that tragic day when America was otherwise blind-sided by a small group of deluded thugs.  9/11 is still unbelievable, and four and a half years later, we need to be reawoken to the consequences of that terrible day.  Nearly everyone is shown with slow reaction time, but their incredulousness is understandable.  (Some of the bureacracy should have taught us many lessons.) The movie honors the people of United flight 93 and puts a set of faces on the tragedy.  ""United 93"" gives us another chance to grieve, appreciate, and remember.  It also allows us an opportunity to face our worst fears.",1146355200,11,1377,4.7594936708860756
1550967,5,B00005JOZI,"Hard on the heels of last January's TV Movie ""Flight 93,"" acclaimed filmmaker Paul Greengrass brought his own variation of the fate of the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 to the screen, in the first theatrical feature to deal with the events of September 11, 2001.

After seeing the television film, I thought it would be hard for any film, even a theatrical feature, to match the power and emotional charge that the first film had. But ""United 93"" succeeds with flying colors. A totally different approach all together, Greengrass depicts the events from the plane, with no dramatic imbellishment. This gives the film an immeadiacy that truly puts the viewer on the plane with these men and women. This is what gives ""United 93"" it's power. The scenes of air traffic controllers and military personnel trying to figure out what is happening on that fateful Tuesday morning are equally harrowing.

The cast and crew do a fantastic job of recreating this tragic event of recent history, while showing the bravery of the men and women who fought to re-take Flight 93, and prevent possibly hundreds more from being murdered.

I highly recommend this film, both as a reminder of that fateful day, and as a reminder of what we are fighting to prevent from happening again.

1550968,1,B00005JOZI,"After watching the excellent A&E made-for-TV version of this story, I eagerly anticipated the Hollywood fim version.  If the cinematographer and director had used conventional film techniques, instead of blurry close-ups and shaky hand-held camera work that gave us repititous jittery views, if the director would have chosen to give some insight into the characters, instead of the fly-on-the-wall view with no one's thoughts, if the director had given us SOME of the humanity, then this film might have worked.  Like most Americans, I cannot fathom the terror felt by the brave people aboard United Flight 93. I cannot fathom the pain experienced by their families, but I can imagine and have to because there is little in UNITED 93 to help me.

It took a good half hour (and some aspirin) to rid myself of the headache and longer to lose the nausea of watching the amaterish filming in this movie.  Instead of using the jumpy hand-held technique used in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the director should have followed Steven Spielberg's technique in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where hand-held cameras with MOTION DAMPENERS were used, instead of taped to the backs of jumping monkeys as it appears was used in UNITED 93.

Without the back stories, without the agony of familes on the ground getting phones calls from the people aboard the plane, without the names or identies of the victims, it just seems like a waste of film.

Save your money with this one.  Wait for A&E to rebroadcast their FLIGHT 93 or buy the DVD or videotape from A&E.

If you insist on seeing UNITED 93, bring apirin and motion-sickness pills.",1146355200,33,1609,4.868131868131868
1550999,5,B00005JOZI,"This movie is a fitting tribute to those brave Americans who gave their lives on 9/11/01. I can't imaging it having been done better. It is raw, realistic, and respectful. It drives home all of the shock, vulnerability, and bravery that America experienced and/or observed on that day. This movie captures those aspects of 9/11 with absolutely no political agenda.

Some have asked if United 93 came too soon. I don't think so. I'm just impressed that this movie was made with so little 'agenda' this soon after that horrendous and now politically charged event. Americans (including many of the 9/11 families) and our politicians could take a lesson away from this powerful film...To use the events of 9/11/01 for personal or political gain does nothing to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice almost 5 years ago.",1146355200,16,821,4.949275362318841
1551000,5,B00005JOZI,"I can understand why this movie is so controversial. The issue isn't really whether or not the victims or their families are being exploited for profit, but whether we as filmgoers are being exploited by having our own trauma sold back to us.

What it really falls down to is this: if you're not ready for a film about 9/11, you shouldn't see this film. It doesn't mean you're a bad person or that you're living in denial. It just means that you understandably don't want to relive the chaos of that day, which is exactly what the film offers.

If, on the other hand, you are ready and willing to confront the reality of September 11 head on, I cannot stress this enough: this film must must MUST be seen in theaters. On video, it will be impossible to completely immerse yourself to the same extent. I wouldn't say that for many other films, but without the complete darkness, the surround sound, and the presence of strangers in crowded seats. Because what makes the film so incredible is the way it places you on the plane and in the various control rooms.

Anyone who would accuse United 93 of overdramatization or propaganda obviously hasn't seen it. There are no speeches about the triumph of the human soul or the tragedy of the human condition. Indeed all of the dialog sounds overheard because the characters have no idea they're in a movie. The extensive use of handheld supports the illusion that we're watching the events as they unfold. And if this film is propaganda, someone is going to have to tell me where the propaganda lies.

If anything, the film doesn't exploit enough. As incredible as it is now, I don't think it's going to have a very long shelf life because those who haven't lived it will find it boring. And like I said before, it can only be really appreciated in theaters. There's no other way to drive that ending: You're in the cockpit with the rest of the passengers. You look out the window and see the ground fast approaching. The screen goes completely black and stays that way as you slowly return to the theater in time to catch the credits.

This is one of the best films of the decade, a sober and respectful chronical of that day. It's powerful and gutwrenching, but never tries to milk the material for cheap melodrama. If you want to attack a film for exploitation, you should go after Flight 93, United's soap-opera counterpart which A&E has been playing nonstop this week to boost ratings from the publicity of United.",1146355200,21,2463,4.575963718820861
1551001,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 was an intense and strong film bringing us back to that horrible day years ago.  The weather was beautiful and people were coming back from their long 3 day holiday trying to settle back into their hectic work schedules.  The movie opens from the point of view of the hijackers and the actors portrayed very well the anxiety and edginess that comes with knowing you are going do to what you plan to do.  We see air-traffic control, and the F.A.A. at work prior to any events and the film lays out very well how hectic their day-to-day work is without the chaos of what occurs next.

The first evidence we see that something has gone wrong is when air-traffic control (ATC) losses contact with American Airlines flight #11 which left from Boston at 7:59 am, heading for Los Angeles.  At first, no one can believe it is a hijacking, but ATC can see that the transponder has been shut off and the plane suddenly turns South off course.  We then see the point of view from NORAD and their responses.  Instantly, you can feel the tension and urgency of the situation from all stand-points.  Meanwhile, things still remain calm on United Flight 93, except the tension building for the terrorists as they draw nearer to execution of their horrible plan.  Once the hijackers on flight 93 mobilize the chaos caused by their quick movements and instant stabbing of a passenger, makes the other passengers at first unable to respond.  Soon they have taken control of the plan and murdered both pilots.  As history knows, the crew and passengers learned from the phone calls out-bound that two planes were flown into the WTC and that the Pentagon had also been hit.  This information changed the passengers mind about the gravity of their situation, that in fact they were not being flown back to an airport safely, but rather part of a sinister suicide mission.

The movie held somewhat true, other than the terrorist-held photograph showing of the Capital building in Washington, where the hijackers were 'supposedly' taking the plane. At times, the camera could be a little choppy, but it added some realism to the airplane scenes.

Overall, I thought this was an excellent movie and it brought back much of the feelings I remember feeling on that horrible day.  Each of us have our own story about where we were, but this is the story of where all these passengers were and what they tried to do to thwart off the eminent attack that surely awaited us.  Go see this movie on the big screen, it's definitely worth it!!!!",1146355200,14,2521,4.669683257918552
1551002,5,B00005JOZI,"Absolutely outstanding. The first reviewer could not possibly have seen it. No one despises the America-hating liberal Hollywood Left more than I do and this movie bears NO relation to the looney Clooney/Moore garbage. This movie is as close to the truth as can be, considering we can never know exactly what was done and said in the cabin during that doomed flight, and it is critical history. These heroes actually recognized pure evil for what it was and took the fight to the terrorists in the first battle of the war we are in. The terrorists did not achieve their goal on that flight; all died, but the heroes won and the terrorists lost.

The movie is profound, and very well-made. I consider it my civic duty and my duty to the memory of those fallen heroes to have gone, and on opening weekend to help contribute to the memorial fund. I will likely see it in the theatre again and definitely will buy the DVD for the interviews and extras. Again, outstanding.",1146355200,21,968,4.563218390804598
1551003,5,B00005JOZI,"Looking at this movie as just a movie, it was as well done technically and as well acted as any movie I can remember.  I particularly liked the the air controllers in Boston and NY

The roles of the the Army officers and the head of airline control were done very well.  The cluelessness of some of the soldiers at the idea that it might be a real war situation while the officers try to get them in the right mindset.  It's not an encouraging image but would be a true one.

The passengers on the plane radiated normalcy, we don't see any special stories highlighted, and no attempt was made to even identify them.  This was a VERY powerful device as it stressed that these people could have been any American.  I don't know if the idea of the European passenger wanting NOT to act was a plot device or not, it made me smirk.

The actors who played the hijackers were first rate, we of course don't know the mind of these men so the greatest liberties had to be taken with them.  It is a tough role and they pulled it off well.

It is Ironic that I saw this movie with my son just after watching Tora Tora Tora.  Even though my father fought in the pacific during the war I found myself reacting very differently to the two movies.  I suspect because one group is reactive (soldiers obeying orders of Japan) and another group who could have at any time decided not to do what they set out to do.

As far as my feelings about the movie, I was over a friends house  on Sept 11 playing in a tabletop baseball league.  The planes hitting the towers didn't really phase me as I assumed it was terror, when the news of flight 93 passengers fighting back and stopping that plane from it's target THAT's when it hit me.  The last 5 minutes of this movie fill me with great satisfaction.  I kept finding myself saying don't wait don't wait.  You KNEW that they wouldn't get to the contols in time to save the plane, but you still wanted it to happen.

1551004,5,B00005JOZI,"This was an excellent portrayal of what may have happened on Flight 93 on 9/11.  At times the movie was scary - but not because of the suspense, but because it was so real - it happened. Everyone has a personal story -- where were you on 9/11, what were you doing and so on. This brings up those memories and tugs at your emotions as well. People in the audience were silent during the whole film - a packed room, including teenagers out for a fun night out. You could almost feel the suspense and disbelief.  Many people were moved to tears.  Most importantly the courage of those people on the flight who stopped the hijackers is a reminder to us all that we each can make a difference, even though sometimes it may seem the odds are stacked against us.",1146355200,16,755,4.302816901408451
1551005,5,B00005JOZI,"Let's say only one percent of the members of the religion of peace want you dead, that's some ten million killers.  Half a percent?  Five million killers.  Since the ratio on September 11th was about a dozen to three thousand, it will only take a handful of that ten million to completely destroy the American way of life.

This movie showed the raw truth, a huge chunk of the worlds population wants America gone.  Dead.  Killed.  Murdered.  The religion they use may have plenty of peaceful members but as this movie, this true story, shows; it only takes a few to murder masses of people.

Why should you see this movie?  Because sometimes it takes raw emotion, raw reality to wake us up to reality.  There is a war and it's ugly.  This movie was a war movie, a real war movie.  Not a made up story, but a real story.

As a movie?  Yes, as a dramatic movie it was good.  Next to the Passion, this was the most intense emotional movie I've ever seen.  Should you see it?  Yes.  Every American should see this movie, maybe twice.

Did you know a self confessed liberal made this movie?  Yes, and he realizes that we are at war.  It doesn't matter if you hate Bush, hate the war, hate big oil, the bottom line is that if you don't kill terrorists they will kill you, or your neighbor, or someone you love or simply just another American like those depicted in this movie.  Regular Americans killed just for being Americans, living in the land of freedom.

Liberals should see this movie twice, maybe three times.  The terrorists want you dead, no matter how much you hate Bush, they still want to kill you.  That was the message in this movie, the underlining story.  They want you dead.

As a film, it's a five star, as a message it's a ten star.  They want you dead.  They can't be reasoned with.  They can't be talked to.  They don't care about freedom.  They don't care about liberty.  Perhaps if you convert and accept their leaders, they might let you live, but the bottom line here is that they want you dead.

I strongly recommend this movie.  It's not too graphic (blood and gore wise) to take older kids (teens) despite the R rating, and I think, again, that every single America should see this movie.  It should effect how we vote, plan, think and behave in this new world.  The new post 9/11 world.  It wasn't enough when they bombed the trade center, it had to go down for us to get the message, and while it was a horrible act, perhaps it had to be something that big to shock us into realizing that the enemy wants us dead and gone.  This movie drives home that message.  Really drives it home.

If you don't normally go to the theater, make an exception and go.  Please.  If you normally vote for the democrats, please go see this movie.  If you don't think that more death and destruction is coming, via the religion of peace, go see this movie.  Also please read A Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam.  Please.

Go see this movie and remember 9/11, don't let those hero's of Flight 93 down, they died saving lives on the ground.  See the movie.",1146355200,25,3064,4.376114081996435
1551006,5,B00005JOZI,"The moment this movie started, I felt my heart start to pound in anticipation of being upset, angry, terrified, and generally put through an emotional wringer.  This is not a ""pleasant"" moving-going experience.  It's wrenching because for me it brought back many of my feelings from 9/11.  Helplessness, anger, sadness.  But it also gave me new respect for the passengers on United 93, and for many of the people in the air traffic control towers who could do little beyond watch helplessly.

The movie is more or less in real time.  We aren't introduced to any characters in a predictable way.  No back stories...heck, no names are given for most of the main characters.  It's as though we are ono the plane or in the tower with the people who were there.  We can't do anything but watch and cringe.

Some have said it makes us feel like we're there with the passengers.  I didn't feel that, because I knew I was safe.  But I did have this amazing feeling of wishing I could change things.  I knew that in a few minutes, all these people would be dead, but I was looking urgently for the hope that the story might turn out differently.

The movie is well-acted, but it's more about the editing and cinematography.  It's fast moving, and often visually a little confusing.  After all, the director, Peter Greengrass, was trying to be as faithful as possible to the real events, but we don't know what all of them are...just snippets gleaned from phone conversations and minimal transmissions.  The rest was filled in...so one way to handle the gaps in our knowledge is to throw the camera right in the middle of the action, where we're so close that much of what we see are closeups of jostling torsos, and lots of yelling and noise.

It's hard to review this film, because we're very close to it still.  But what it does do is remind the viewer again that we were attacked, and that we were attacked not by a rational enemy with a negotiable aim.  We were attacked by religous zealots who truly believe that our deaths are their salvation.  It's important to remember.  It's important to remember that sometimes when we engage the enemy, we don't have perfect clarity as to what they are doing, but we DO know that inaction won't result in a happy capitulation.  I'm not trying to politicize the movie, but that's the first effect it had on me.

Best of all, the cast of this movie looks like REAL people.  No great beauties or handsome hunks.  The people who took action sweated with fear or wept with terror.  They weren't commandos on a mission, they were fathers, sons, wives and children who thought first of their loved ones and then of the lives they might save by risking their own.  And they nearly pulled off saving their own lives...but we are quite sure they saved hundreds of lives who would have been lost in our capital that day.

The movie is R-rated, mostly for some cussing (not too much, though) but mostly, I would say, for the intensity of the film.  One hundred years from now, when things have changed a great deal in the world, viewers will probably wonder what the fuss was about.  But for a world not even 5 years removed from the event, UNITED 93 is vital viewing.",1146268800,22,3192,4.537653239929948
1551007,5,B00005JOZI,"On America's darkest day, terrorist cells commandeered four commercial airplanes and aimed them at iconic symbols of American Democracy and Capitalism.  Three planes found their targets.  ""United 93"" is the story of the fourth.

The film covers the entire morning of September 11, with the closest thing to a ""lead"" being FAA Director of Operations Ben Sliney, whose portrays himself on his first day on the job with a remarkable performance for a neophyte actor.  Several other officials and military personal re-create their roles on that faithful day.

Selecting a number of people to play themselves was the first step writer/director Peter Greengrass made to present the events in the film as they truly happened.  Greengrass allows the drama to build itself, steering clear of manufactured moments of melodrama many would expect from a movie about a doomed aircraft.

The film also refuses to use hindsight in determining which facts to emphasize and has total ambivalence for the cultural impact of some people/events.  No special significance if given to Beamer's ""let's roll"" direction that became a rallying cry for America and no reference is made to the group being lead by a hulkish homosexual who helped redefine the image of effeminate gays in a pre-Brokeback world.  Even though those have been two important stories to come from Flight 93, nobody on the flight that day knew it...so the film doesn`t revise reality to acknowledge them.

The brilliance of a film like this can be understood by comparing it to the film many would have made instead.  A lesser film would have Brad Pitt or Eric Bana playing Mark Bingham and Matt Damon or Tom Cruise playing Todd Beamer.  The action would have slowed for the characters to capture the focus of the audience and build cliched subplots about lifelong struggles to overcome adversity.  Their final rush to glory would have been a moment of catharsis, as they were able to overcome some fault that haunted them for years.

Thankfully, ""United 93"" is not that film.  It is an unflinching, unromanticized account of the events of 9/11.  Free from conspiracy speculation or total disdain for our enemies (they are confused, naive men; not mustache twirling villains), the film offers little or no politics/values.  Michael Moore fans will most likely not enjoy this movie because it doesn't take aim directly at our government and doesn't spend time blaming America and claiming we created a world where 9/11 was inevitable.

People will come away with different ideas about how the morning unfolded.  Some will unfairly say the FAA, NORAD and the military were too slow in reacting to the initial hijackings.  But I believe by showing the events in real time, audiences see how fast everything unfolded, giving little chance of preventing the terrorists from carrying out their first three missions.  The only thing standing in the way of the last were the people aboard United 93.  And on the worst day in America's history, one group of normal citizens banded together to show the resolve and bravery that continues to move a grateful nation and will forever earn them the title of ""heroes"".",1146268800,21,3151,5.007677543186181
1551008,5,B00005JOZI,"It's hard to review this movie as one would an ordinary movie, but it was moving & great!

I don't generally like the way docudramas play out. This movie, a combo of fiction & fact, filmed in cin?ma v?rit? style as well, tho the hand held cameras don't seem like those which filmed your nephew's HS graduation, is a detailed creation of what might've occurred on the plane, based on the partial transcripts & a detailed re-creation of what is reported to have occurred on the ground. But it's a reasonable enough creation & re-creation. It's not Kate Winslett on the deck of The Titanic with overpowering music in the background followed by Gloria Stuart bringing us up to date. Or the WW II Bomber movie with all characters spouting ageless witticisms & aphorisms.  It's intense & constantly so, but it's not ""painful"" to watch. And its emotions never descend into treacly sentimentality.

It portrays ordinary Americans rising to the occasion in extraordinary circumstances, as we hope we would do.

It doesn't excuse or even portray sympathetically these mad Islamofascists who'd use our technology, which they could never develop themselves, to bring us back to the 13th century.

It doesn't wander into Conspiracy Theories, Big Oil, Halliburton, Black Helicopters, or Election 2000.

Of course, while those suffering from The Bush Derangement Syndrome will be able to say that the failures ultimately belong to the leader (The Buck stops here!), there was no simplistic Bush bashing in the film. Instead it reminds us, of all such situations where people are asked to make decisions in the absence of all the facts, in the absence of perspective, as in  Pearl Harbor, where everyone, including Roosevelt & MacArthur, was at sixes & sevens.

The film is, quite simply, a masterpiece.

I could see myself as it was for me that day, driving to work, casually listening to the radio, and then mortified as the news trickled through.  I doubt that anyone else could do a better job than those who made this movie of giving me those indelible images of what  was simultaneously happening at the center of the story, which now are as vivid for me as my own experience.

I remember seeing the first teaser trailer for it at the end of 2005 (back when it was called ""Flight 93"") and immediately thinking about how the public would react to it. One of the greatest public concerns was that, because it was made only six years after the attacks, emotions would still be too raw to allow anyone to focus on anything other than the pain and frustration. I have to admit that I was one of those people; why would anyone want to capitalize on a national catastrophe so soon afterwards? But then the film was released, and I listened to a lot of the reviews, which have certainly been more than favorable. And rightly so. This is not just a movie; it's a horrific reminder of the sorrow that befell America that dark September morning, and in my opinion, it should be required viewing for all of humanity.

When it comes to a film like this, it's not a matter of liking it or of finding it entertaining. If it were made with those goals in mind, it would be one of the most offensive, insulting things to ever smear itself on the silver screen. What does matter is whether or not it's an important movie, made to present the facts in an appropriate and informative way. ""United 93"" definitely delivers in that regard. Nothing is extraneous or melodramatic; it's almost like a documentary in that it's an accurate unfolding of moments that most people have not had the chance to learn about. On top of that, it's so touching that it absolutely guarantees some kind of reaction (loud, soft, or silent). I say this in regard to everyone, not just to the victims' family and friends. Unless you have ice water in your veins, you'll find this to be profoundly moving, especially when the passengers make their last phone calls.

Paul Greengrass took the awesome responsibility of writing and directing this film, no small task considering the potential repercussions from the American public. He went as far as to personally appeal to the family members of the ill-fated United 93 passengers, something that took a great deal of courage and determination on his part. I can't say if they all agreed to this film being made, but apparently enough of a consensus was reached. They must have known that he wouldn't make something that exploited their loved ones' deaths; rather, he would respectfully present their final moments in honest, straightforward terms. He opted to not focus on the background stories of the passengers or hijackers (the latter of which I couldn't help but feel sorry for; they were brainwashed to believe that murdering innocent people was the only solution). The best we're given are little snippets of overheard conversations, ones that seem completely unscripted and make use of everyday language. Nothing anyone says in this film seems contrived, and for that we have more than Greengrass to thank; we also have to thank the actors for their realistic portrayals.

The air traffic controllers eventually have to figure out exactly what's going on in the skies above; every moment of those scenes is hectic, emotional, and filled with frustration. Things only get worse when the military gets involved, especially since a lot of the information they receive is chaotic and conflicting. When the first plane crashes into the World Trade Center, they scramble like mad to determine whether or not it was American Airlines flight 11, and by the end of the film they still don't know for sure (some reports said that it was still in the air despite disappearing from the radar screen). By the time military action is decided on, another host of problems occur, not the least of which were the unequipped fighter jets and the inability to get hold of the President. They were thoroughly authentic scenes, made even better by the fact that many of the air traffic controllers working that day were cast to play themselves.

I don't think it matters anymore if ""United 93"" was released too soon. Even before its release, some cities were forced to pull the trailer from theaters because it was still enough of a reminder. Now that it has been released, many in all likelihood will come away feeling angry, bitter, and remorseful. Of course this movie is a downer, but it's an important downer, bringing to light the story of the airplane passengers who tried but ultimately failed to take control of their hijacked flight on September 11, 2001. Everything from the casting of unknown actors to the editing all came together beautifully, and the end result is something truly powerful. It's good to know that the first movie about 9/11 was carefully and respectfully crafted. I honestly believe that years from now, people will remember this movie just as much as they remember that awful day in 2001, when so many lives were tragically cut short.",1146268800,24,4942,4.796948356807512
1551061,2,B00005JOZI,"I'm a big fan of ""Bloody Sunday"" and a high admirer of director Paul Greengrass even though I see this film as far removed from a masterpiece.

It's excruciatingly painful, at times very effective. Greengrass has a gift for enveloping an audience and providing it with a visceral movie-going experience. His hand-held camera is not the gimmicky trick of so many other directors, but a tool to drop viewers into the middle of confusing, horrific chaos.

But is this enough in itself to make the case for a great film or even an important one? Some professional reviewers seem to have based their overwhelming praise only on how the film made them feel -- devastated, glum, fearful, pained. It made me feel those ways, too. But the impact of the film is in the name of what? There has not been a terribly persuasive review to seriously contemplate that question or at least make a convincing case for the answer.

Pauline Kael once wrote that ""'The Pawnbroker' is terrible yet wrenches us."" It's difficult to imagine most reviewers of today making a similar assessment about a movie. The movie is all about the way it makes them ""feel,"" and then there is little assessment of what purpose the movie's impact serves.

Greengrass has received a lot of points for what he didn't do in this film. It's not a cheap or overtly exploitative film; it doesn't use big stars; it strives for the feeling of authenticity using many non-actors, some of whom were even part of September 11. That's an achievement and points to some real artistic and personal integrity on his part, but it still doesn't make a case for a significantly worthwhile film.

""United 93"" should not be considered a masterpiece simply because Denzel Washington hasn't been cast as the leader of the passengers and the music doesn't swell up when they fight back.

The film is deliberately stripped of all political and historical context to provide one director/writer's perspective of what could have occurred on United 93 that terrible day. The film's only relief from the claustrophobic plane interior is crosscutting to aviation authorities who are baffled over what is taking place.

Everything about the film is ""experiential""; it's about what it might have felt like during those horrific hours. And nothing more.

It succeeds in providing a ""lived-in"" feeling by avoiding traditional sentimentality, played-up dialogue and familiar character background, but it would be wrong to buy into the idea that Greengrass doesn't have his own agenda.

Yes, he goes to great lengths to recreate many physical details and moments: He has talked to the families and other key 9/11 players and reviewed 9/11 documents. But there are large gaps that he fills with scenes meant to prop up the ordinary passengers of United 93 as collective hero.

Maybe they were, but what happened on that flight and why it happened are not known.

What we do know is that the passengers of United 93 realized that they would most certainly die had they not fought back. What we do know is that their dangerous effort was their only chance to survive. Did they fight back strictly out of self survival or to spare so many other deaths on the ground or both? Since the passengers' collective heroism is at the center of the film, there is plenty of speculation; we get scenes where the passengers kill terrorists and the group boldly breaks into the cockpit.

When the entire justification for a movie is that we must never forget, the reasons for providing details that are not verifiable must be seriously considered. United 93 has taken on mythological proportions since September 11. I maintain that Greengrass does not mean to truly debunk that mythology but to give it more gravity.

The movie's first half hour or so stirs up unimaginable dread in the audience. Greengrass does a masterful job in showing ordinary people preparing to take an ordinary flight. Since we know how it will turn out, the palpable horror builds slowly but surely. And since we do not identify with these passengers, we're simply waiting for a hell we know is certain to take place. It's unbearable, but is it justified? Is it enlightening or edifying in any significant way or does it simply fill us with visceral fear?

Greengrass makes these moments even harder to take by the little pieces of conversation we overhear among passengers and crew. Many of them talk about children or trips they are going to take. The conversations have a non-movieish ring of ""ordinary,"" but they also become a piercing reminder of what these people unknowingly are about to leave behind or will never be able to experience. Isn't it possible that one of them also talked about the Yankees or the traffic or something that wouldn't blatantly remind us of a shockingly shortened life?

Like ""United 93,"" other movies have focused on minutiae, but the best of them have built to something larger and monumental. ""Shoah,"" the marathon documentary about the Holocaust, is the best example. Director Claude Lanzmann asks detailed, mundane questions that build in mind and feeling of experience over the course of many hours. The enormity of the Holocaust slowly accumulates so that the movie becomes much ""larger"" than the questions that are asked.

But ""United 93"" does the opposite. It doesn't build to something larger by focusing on mundane details. It removes political and historical context from a dark historic day and shrinks 9/11 down to making its audience live out a hellish last plane ride with ordinary people.

With all context missing in this film, what then does it really say about 9/11, and is there any reason to take this trip with them? Greengrass is such a good filmmaker and has us so devastated that we can't stop shaking long enough to realize the answer to these two important questions are not all that much and no.",1146268800,21,5842,4.861167002012072

1551128,5,B00005JOZI,"MOVIE: Film, the most powerful form of expression. Paul Greengrass' United 93 was one of the most moving, terrifying, emotional, and profound movie-going experiences in my life. The film tells the tragic tale of flight 93, the only hijacked plane that never made its target. Historical accounts presented through film are a different type of viewing experience in that we the audience know the outcome. When I watch films like Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor, Schindler's List, Platoon, and other historical films I am experiencing these events for the first time. I was born in 1987, so I never lived through a great war, never experienced one firsthand even though my generation is in the middle of one right now. Sepetember 11th affected all of us, whether we lost someone or not. This is the first film that current generations will experience as a recounting of a tragic event that we lived through. We watched the towers fall, the people jump from hundreds of stories above the concrete jungle. Now Paul Greengrass brings an intimate and very real look into the lives of a few strangers who decided not to sit back and stay quiet. The film sets the tone immediately as it opens a beautiful sunny day as people arrive at the airport, talking on their phones, reading the paper, and getting ready for their flights. We never learn the names of any of the people in the movie, and all of the actors were cast as ""no name"" actors. It was done for the sole reason of not to exploit this event, and to make it seem as realistic as possible. The film uses parallel editing and jumps back and forth to the unfolding events in the plane and the events in the various control rooms of the military and air traffic control. Greengrass' style is shakey documentary style filmmaking, and those who saw The Bourne Supremacy can recall that. This style works to perfection, and creates a sense of chaos and confusion in the control rooms where 50 people are running around trying to comprehend what happened. They turn on CNN to see one of the towers in flames, later they witness the second plane hitting the next tower. Silence falls, and as I sat in my seat I began to tremble with my eyes beginning to water. We jump back to the plane where Greengrass places the camera as if it were the point of view of one of the passangers. All these passengers are strangers to each other, so they are strangers to the audience. The scenes on the airplane are terrifying, and will grip you and shake you at your core. The fear and the terror feels too real, I was so concentrated as I watched this film because it was so captivating and involving, and the only thing I can say to express my feelings is to quote one of the flight attendents on the plane, ""I don't want to be here"". The film is important, it's important because it brings new light to something so familiar. Is it too soon though? At first I thought so, but I realize now that it's not too soon at all. It still feels like it was yesterday that I watched the towers fall and the cloud of dust engulf New York City, images like that do not fade. So even 20 years from now people would still be saying it's too soon. The film doesn't deal with politics and is all about the courageous people who did the bravest thing any human being could do, and that is sacrifice their lives. Every American needs to see this film, it has to be seen no matter how uncomfortable it will make you feel. I watch movies like Saving Private Ryan to experience the past, in 20 years people my age will be doing the same with United 93. I am writing this review 4 hours after I saw the film, and I am still shaken by it. It feels like it happened all over again, but you know, it was worth it.

ACTING: You won't be able to name any actors in this film, and it was casted like that for a purpose. If I was a WWII veteran and I watched Saving Private Ryan, I would probably say ""That's Tom Hanks, he's an actor, he didn't fight in WWII"". In this film you can't name any actor, and that makes it all the more real and you end up forgetting that you are watching a movie. The acting is superb, it's what drove the film. It must have been uncomfortable to film some of these scenes, the terror is genuinely real.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" - Dylan Thomas. I leave you on that note.",1146182400,37,4429,4.380315917375456
1551129,5,B00005JOZI,"...and haven't we, just a little?

It seems that we have once again become complacent about the world that we live in. I think that we all panic a little every time we get on a plane now, but overall we are not as aware as we were on Sept 12.

This is a film that should be seen and a time that should never be forgotten. Kudos to the film makers for taking such a sensitve subject and handling it brilliantly. The documentary style made you feel the chaos both on the plane and on the ground. No one character is the hero. In fact there is no character developement or story here (if you are thinking Jack and Rose forget it). This is real time action. This is not a nailbiting action flick, the first hour moves along pretty slowly. Much like any other normal Tuesday morning would be. The film oes not offer any explanations about why Sept 11 happened, just that it did. See this movie, talk about it, don't forget.",1146182400,28,918,4.24
1551130,5,B00005JOZI,"It was Thermopylae. It was the Alamo. It was like nothing that has happened before in human history.

Much of the power of United 93 is the knowledge that while people cannot realistically imagine themselves with the Spartans at Thermopylae or the Texans at the Alamo, just about everyone has flown in an air liner. Everyone seeing this film can imagine themselves among those brave but doomed passengers, fighting with the courage of desperation for the right to get home alive.

Though one knows what must happen in the film, one to the very last finds oneself praying for a different outcome, one in which the passengers seized back the plane and somehow flew it to safety at some nearby air field. But the film is real life, not Hollywood.

Every human being should see this film. It is a testament to the human spirit, of an indomitable desire, even in the face of death, to not go quietly into that good night.",1146182400,214,916,4.607361963190184
1551131,5,B00005JOZI,"United 93 contains many haunting moments, but one comes of great surprise. At an air traffic command center, the staff stands about, confused over reports of a hijacking. A plane has disappeared from the grid, and they don't know what to make of it. Someone brings CNN up on the large viewing screen, they stand, baffled, at the image of a smoking hole in the north tower of the World Trade Center. Reliving the beginning of the attack, only armed with the knowledge we have now, is shattering in a very unexpected way.

British director Paul Greengrass' has put together a look at 9/11 with a narrow focus, but with searing strength and focus that puts the viewer in the center of the action in a way not seen since Saving Private Ryan's D-Day assault sequence. We already know the terrible outcome, but watch with curiosity and suspense, secretly hoping that perhaps history can change, if just for this one movie. Just because we know it won't doesn't make the final passenger assault any less gripping or heartbreaking.

Shot in the British docu-drama style that severed the Greengrass-directed The Bourne Supremacy so well, the film never once feels like fiction, but an omnipresent insider's view of the action. The plot moves quickly but with great dread, scenes inside air command inter-cut with the doomed flight, where the four hijackers anxiously await their time to strike. On the ground, chaos runs rampant, with hundreds of people frantically trying to coordinate a response, ounces of clarity coming bundled with pounds of confusion.

Many of the air control and military personnel are played not by actors, but by the real people, which some have said augments the authenticity.  I instead offer the argument that the plane sequences seem so realistic, that Greengrass could have effortlessly pulled off the same effect using a cast entirely composed of actors. The film's accuracy stems from its incredible power, not the other way around.

Much has been made about the film's lack of a political stance, but all films are political, whether or not they know it. The hijackers are shown as real people, true, but it seems childish to imagine that evil men don't form relationships, shave, or get nervous. The sympathy rests exclusively with the victims, who each receive as much screen time as they require, and no more. I struggled to hear names and hints of who each passenger was, but the only one I recognized for sure was Jeremy Glick, a judo expert who the film theorizes lead the charge. Most of the passenger dialogue involves planning the attack, or very painfully, final phone calls home.

One shocking moment that has received little press (as of now) comes towards the end, where a German passenger tries to alert the hijackers to the rebellion before being restrained. I researched the incident, but could find nothing to support the event, except that a German man was in fact on the plane. Was Greengrass trying to portray Americans as the people who stand up and fight back against terror, while cowards like the Germans would rather negotiate and surrender? Maybe not, but the argument could certainly be made.

If the takeover of the plane is gruesome, the passenger's assault serves as a moment of bloody catharsis. It would be hard not to feel a small piece of joy as the hijackers panic, terrified that instead of becoming part of a holy missile to destroy the U.S. Capitol Building, they are going to be quite literally torn to pieces by furious passengers. I suspect that after the horrified screams of the passengers, the film's most talked about sound effect will be the sickening crunch of a fire extinguisher caving in a hijacker's skull.

Endlessly talked about in the mainstream press, United 93 interestingly hasn't received as much buzz as it might amongst audiences. Many feel the film comes too soon after 9/11, while others are apprehensive about having to view the event through the eyes of the dead. Is United 93 too soon?

United 93 not only isn't too soon, it hasn't arrived quickly enough. It succeeds at honoring the victims of 9/11 beyond the wildest expectation. Appropriately harrowing and terrifying, it instantly reaches a realm of importance that few films do. To avoid this genuinely relevant and amazing film out of fear would be a disservice to oneself and the memory of those portrayed within. Mark my words, there won't be a more important work of art made for a long time to come.",1146182400,28,4449,4.858839050131926
1551132,5,B00005JOZI,"Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy) had a very difficult job in making this film, especially since the film deals with a shaky topic that is still fresh in everyone's mind.  That being said, Greengrass makes all the right choices, from casting to writing to the exceptional camera work.  Most people know the basic gist of 9/11, but United 93 fills in all of the details and gives a framework and timeline of events, all while still giving the viewer just enough time to really care for the characters.  Now, it probably wasn't that tough to get viewers to care for these people, especially since 9/11 affected every United States citizen in one way or another.  The first half of the film really doesn't even deal with United Flight 93, except for showing a few short clips in between action, just to remind us that they are still there.  The first half deals with the other flights that were hijacked, namely American Airlines Flight 11 and another United flight.  There are a few different locations and traffic control centers in the movie, but the main control station, that is, the one the film spends the most time in, is the one headed by air traffic controller Ben Sliney (playing himself in the first Oscar worthy performance of the year).  The interesting thing about the control centers is that I had no idea what any of these people were saying, mainly because of all of the airline jargon going on.  However, I still knew what was happening.  No one had to tell me what was going on.  In fact, if I didn't know the context of the dialogue, I probably would have no idea of what these people are saying.  The first hour of the film is incredibly tense.  Greengrass wastes no time in getting to the action.  There is a lull after the first hour (for about thirty minutes) where nothing major happens with developing hijackings or United 93, which gave me time to notice Greengrass' camera techniques that I didn't notice before (because of the tension).  It was probably a good thing that Greengrass elevated the tension in the film, because the camera work is so out of control (it reminds me of Tony Scott's Domino) that it gave me a headache.  The cameras never fix upon a certain point for more than three or four seconds which makes it kind of hard for the brain to latch on to anything.  At first, I was kind of annoyed, but after thinking about it, the camera work made the film that much better.  It gives the viewer a chance to feel like he or she is actually in the film.  It gives a sense of urgency and panic felt by everyone in the film.  The headache is nothing compared to the feelings felt by everyone involved on the ground, as well as on United 93.  Greengrass also chose to cast unknown people in the film, another wise decision.  It alieviates some of that connection that goes along with big movie star power.  It's also a lower budget film which gives a sense of authenticity.  This is by no means a negative critique of big budget films, but rather a promotion of smaller films with smaller casts.  If you are interested in a big budget production of 9/11, Oliver Stone is releasing a blockbuster event called World Trade Center starring Nicholas Cage (The Weather Man), Michael Pena (Crash), and Maria Bello (A History of Violence) set to come out later this year.  Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece, and I should think that this is a film worthy of anyone's top ten (even mine) at the end of this year (although it is still very early and this is no way a guarantee).  United 93 is an amazing story of courage, fueled with tension, anxiety, strong emotion, and filmed with nothing but respect.",1146182400,21,3650,4.559815950920245
1551133,5,B00005JOZI,"I am glad that I did not have high expectations and had not seen any making-of specials (or even a theatrical trailer) of UNITED 93 and had not read any articles about it or reviews of it prior to going to the first screening of the film on its first day of nation-wide release.  I also had never seen a film directed by Paul Greengrass.  I went because like any other American I will never forget September 11, 2001 and was curious to see the first major Hollywood film dealing directly with the events of that day of infamy.  I would see UNITED 93 with an open mind but not expecting it to be such a major artistic achievement since I generally never believe art and mainstream American filmmaking belong in the same sentence, but I was wrong.  I knew from its opening minutes that it was something special.  A film (and a filmmaker) either has ""it"" or doesn't and Greengrass and UNITED 93 never takes a false step or makes a wrong move from start to finish.

Writer-director Greengrass has made a new kind of film.  There are two kinds of films:  documentary films and fiction films.  UNITED 93 is a wonderful mutation of both.  It was made with a mixture of unknown actors (a brilliant decision - recognizable stars or semi-stars would distract the viewer who would play spot the star and suspend disbelief) and real-life participants in the events of 9/11/01 who portrayed themselves better than any actor could...obviously.  He also wrote and directed the film in a manner that places the viewer in a virtual reality version of the events of that morning.  It is a matter-of-fact style with normal speech rather than obviously-written ""movie"" dialogue.  Greengrass shot the film using a handheld camera to increase the realistic you-are-there feeling, but not an annoyingly jerky handheld camera style.  However, when the action becomes more violent and chaotic during the takeover of Flight 93 by the terrorists and the charge at the terrorists by a group of male passengers, the camerawork tumbles the viewer into the scenes in a startling fashion.  Greengrass also uses a moving music score sparingly not pounding the viewer with it like a lot of Hollywood filmmakers would have made the mistake of doing.  UNITED 93 is an emotional experience, not a sentimental experience and there is a huge difference between the two - the difference between what a simple movie maker would do and what an artist does.

UNITED 93 is a vastly different film from other recent films that used actual American historic events as backdrops for their fictional stories featuring movie stars in major roles.  TITANIC and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN both recreated unforgettable events in American history quite well but those two films were actually dominated by the routine Hollywood stories they wanted to tell:

TITANIC was about a rich girl-poor boy/opposites attract romance story starring American matinee idol Leonardo DiCaprio and British matinee idol Kate Winslet.

SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a search and rescue story starring back-to-back Best Actor Oscar-winner Tom Hanks and up-and-coming pretty boy star Matt Damon and a supporting cast playing classic war movie soldier types (aka cliches).

There is no denying that James Cameron recreated the sinking of the Titanic and Steven Spielberg recreated the D-Day invasion with awesome technical skill but that is where the similarities between those films and UNITED 93 end.  Ridley Scott's BLACK HAWK DOWN is more similar to UNITED 93.  The majority of that film is a recreation of the ambush experienced by American troops in Mogadishu done in a brutally realistic and minute-by-minute style much like UNITED 93.  However, the difference is Scott used recognizable actors including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, and Tom Sizemore.  I think that UNITED 93 has no precedent in the history of American film.  It is a documentary-like fiction film.

Greengrass had the difficult task of making the first major movie specifically about September 11, 2001.  He could have failed miserably and most likely would.  This film was guaranteed to receive a lot of attention and criticism before anyone even saw it.  Americans (especially those directly victimized by the events of that day) AND people of Middle-Eastern descent could be offended by this film.  At the very least, he could have made a bad movie simply in terms of artistic quality.  Actually, Greengrass has made a masterpiece that honors America and does not demonize all Middle-Easterners (only those responsible).  If anyone commits any hate crimes because they hate the cold killers in this film, they are responsible for their own actions, not a filmmaker.  Greengrass simply portrays the events as a neutral observer would see them.  The terrorists did what they did because THEY believed it was what they were supposed to do and the passengers of Flight 93 did what they did because they thought it was what they had to do.  Greengrass uses such a detached style, there is no way he can be accused of pushing American propoganda or of racism.

One of the achievements of UNITED 93 is how well it sustains such a level of suspense when it is telling a story that everyone knows and remembers so well.  It is difficult to make a movie work when everyone who sees it already knows what is going to happen and how it is going to end.  The key is how well the director can keep us in their grip even though we already have that advantage.  I think that because this film is based on a true story of recent times which had a major emotional impact on all of our lives, it is easier to get caught up in the film even though we know what is going to happen.  Plus, unless you have a good knowledge of 9/11/01, Greengrass can still surprise you with a ""plot twist"" like discovering (along with the characters in the film) that Flight 11 did not crash into the World Trade Center and is still in the air and still poses a threat.  It is the style of his direction and the little details in his script that most impressed me.  Anyone who has ever travelled by airplane in this country (especially if they do it often) can relate to the portrayal of people waiting in the gate area ignoring each other having their individual conversations on their cell phones or ignoring the routine safety instructions that precedes each flight - I loved the series of shots during this scene:  passengers nodding off, looking out the window, or focused on their laptop screen - exactly how it is on an airplane:  nobody pays attention to these speeches (especially pre-9/11/01).  And how cruelly ironic it is when we see the last passenger rush to make it onto Flight 93 on time (he and his luggage getting through security at the last second quite easily back then, of course) and being told by a flight attendant that he ""just made it.""  And as destiny would have it, this man wearing a University of California hat will be one of the men who bravely (whether true or via speculation of the what happened onboard, we will never know) rushes the terrorists later in the film.  Most of the film's action centers on Flight 93 whether directly or indirectly, the fate of the other planes were all related.  Greengrass crosscuts between Flight 93 itself and the air traffic centers monitoring the flights that day and the headquarters of NORAD, which is accustomed to simulated events, not real events.  It is interesting to hear everyone's disbelief that there would be a hijacking in America - did any of us think that would happen here where we foolishly thought we were immune to such things?  UNITED 93 is also sprinkled with mundane moments of conversations between the flight attendants and between the co-pilots about their plans for the upcoming days.  These wonderful little moments that most filmmakers would not have included make these people and their impending doom that much more poignant.  The preparation by the terrorists for the hijacking (done in great detail), the last calls home to loved ones by the passengers, and the action-packed finale obviously were going to be featured strongly.  It is everything else that Greengrass includes that makes it truly memorable and emotional.

From the solemn opening... through the wonderful use of flight patterns on FAA computer screens and CNN footage from that day... to the horrifying final moments and crash (rather than fade) to black, UNITED 93 is one of the most impressive cinematic experiences of my life.  I think that it is more powerful for being made so soon after 2001 while it is still relatively fresh in our minds, but that it will be just as powerful when our children or grandchildren first experience those events through this film years from now.  It kept my stomach in knots and my hands clenched for two hours, but I still recommend it be seen because even though it is very painful to watch (probably worse than THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST although not as explicitly violent), UNITED 93 ensures that we don't forget the tragedy of 9/11/01 or the positive actions of some of its heroes.  Plus, I believe it is a great work of art.",1146182400,37,9089,4.812097812097812
1551134,5,B00005JOZI,"I saw the movie about an hour ago, it was the second showing for the day, started at 2:25pm. I was told at the box office that the movie would start on time at 2:25pm with no previews. That is unusual and added to the somber mood, it reminded me of when ""Schindler's List"" was first shown on TV, there were no commercial interruptions, I believe that was a historic first.

The movie was excellent in every way. It was also non-political. People who say that they are not ready to see a movie about 9/11 are probably being honest, but the ones who add that it is too soon to make a movie about 9/11 are somehow emotionally dodging the issue. There is nothing to wait for. My heart was pounding during most of the movie, probably because I knew that what I saw on the screen was mostly true, so it was very hard to tell myself: ""it's only a movie."" Some people in the audience had to wipe away tears, including me. The scariest thing about the terrorists was that they were disciplined, deadly warriors, driven by deeply held religious convictions (fundamentalist  Islam). They were neither cowards, nor crazy.

David Beamer, father of Todd Beamer, wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday. He wrote, about the events on flight 93: ""This was our first successful counterattack in our homeland in this new global war"" [...]. That's how the movie feels, like a counterattack, and that's why to me, it felt uplifting in the end, despite the terrible subject matter.",1146182400,32,1474,4.575757575757576
1551135,5,B00005JOZI,"I just returned from watching ""United 93"".  With the exception of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" I can't remember a movie having such moving effect on me.

The entire film seems to be shot with handheld cameras, and this gives it a documentary-type feel.  In fact, it is almost as if this entire thing was captured on video as it actually happened and put in the movie theaters.  I'm sure that is exactly how director Paul Greengrass wanted it to appear.

When I first heard this movie was coming out, I had a mix of emotions.  I worried that the film would portray the terrorists as being successful Jihadists that had foiled all of America's best defenses.  That was not the case.  I worried that ""United 93"" would portray President Bush as a man who failed to lead at such an important time in America's history.  That was not the case - he wasn't even in the movie at all, unless I missed it when I had to leave the theater for a few seconds.

""United 93"" captures the emotional trauma, the desperate decisions, and the shockingly horrid events that took place on September 11, 2001.  The film is not your classical big Hollywood production.  There are no breathtakingly choreographed, large set scenes.  There is no famous Hollywood hunk in a lead role that you will remember for years to come.  No, this is a movie on fire with raw emotion.  It is a movie that takes you where you know evil seems to have won.  This film shows how brave men and women made sure that it didn't.

I'm glad I made the choice to see this film.  It has made me think about how precious life is.  It has made me wonder how people can ever view innocent people as a target of revenge, no matter where they live, no matter how they live, and no matter what they think about my God and my faith.  This film is a tribute to freedom in that the passengers of ""United 93"" decided to fight on, knowing full well that they might die while doing so.

The actors in ""United 93"" kept their performances on real-life mode, with no one actor stealing the show.  That made the film seem like a documentary (I know, I mentioned this above already).  The last few minutes of this movie are so intense that I actually started to dig my fingernails into the theater chair arms while I was watching.  It's that moving!

The movie is also not as bloody or gory as I expected it to be.  I think kids 13 and older will be okay with this film.

So that's my review; one of the most intense and amazing movies ever made.

However, it fictionally alters what in reality was the calm resolve and bravery of the passengers and almost completely omits the FAITH of the Americans - which leads to selfless final expressions of LOVE and bravery - while overplaying the ""devotion"" to a demonic inversion of true faith of the hijackers which leads to cowardice and mass murder.
