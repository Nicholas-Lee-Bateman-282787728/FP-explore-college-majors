8538928,5,B009AZH16M,"Levi Layton is tired of his small towl life and his workaholic father.  Along with his girlfriend Abigail, and friend Tyler, he finds his way out when he receives a large inheritance, Eighteen years old and armed with $100,000, the life he wants is just a midnight escape away.

This is a modern version of the story in the bible about the Prodigal Son.  Which as you know -that story is not so much about the son as how much the FATHER (God)  loves His children (us).  Even when we decided to forget about Him and go out on our own.
A story of Love and Forgiveness.

This movie has a little comedy -mainly at the front of it which does  help you to get pulled into the movie.  If you have ever been in a small church  -this hits it on the nail- you always seem to have some NOSEY-DO-GOOD-ER  who thinks they have a right to push off thier views on everyone in the church.

This movie does have drinking scene in it but it shows the negative effects.  THis is one of the best Christian movies i have seen and it really hit's home.  I think that everybody who sees this could get ""something"" out of this movie.  This movie starts out when Levi is young  which makes it a little more easier to understand and get to  know him.  I do agree  that the guy who plays Tyler and a  few of the other actors do need a little improvement in a their abilities but for the first time of being in a movie--it was amazing how well they did do.  I think they could have used some background music in the movie to help cover and give a more emotional aspect to a few of the area's but  overall---this is a GREAT MOVIE.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie.",1395014400,3,1632,4.1501597444089455
