8129832,5,B000GAKLHQ,"I bought this DVD for my 3.5 year old grandson to watch in the car on the way to the lake, hoping it would entertain him for the 2.5 hour drive. He LOVED it.  Watched it over and over for 2 hours until he fell asleep.  And he begged to watch it over and over again on the way home.  I am very pleased with this find. I found it entertaining and very educational for all segments of the DVD.  Trucks, planes, trains, boats, cars - what boy wouldn't love this.",1168473600,2,458,4.0
