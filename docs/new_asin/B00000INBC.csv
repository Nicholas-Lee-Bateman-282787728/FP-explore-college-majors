8188740,4,B00000INBC,"Goku trains with Gregory in this DVD, a grasshopper with an attitude, and learns two major attacks, the Kaio-Ken, and the unstoppable Spirit Bomb.  Goku also learns more about his past, as the Saiyans finally make it to earth.  They meet up with the Z fighters as Goku races back to earth to help his friends.  Although action wise this isn't the best DBZ, it really gets the plot moving and shows how Goku learns his two attacks.  This DVD is a necessity, although not a lot of fighting the plot helps.  If you've bought the four before this one, then you don't need my review to know it is going to be good.",970617600,,609,4.307017543859649
8188741,1,B00000INBC,"DBZ is a big waste of time, because every episode is a 2 minute story stretched to 30minutes. If you REALLY need to watch this, its on Cartoon network for free in the afternoon. So don't waste your money on DBZ. Buy  Evangelion: Neon Genesis.",958780800,,242,4.377777777777778
