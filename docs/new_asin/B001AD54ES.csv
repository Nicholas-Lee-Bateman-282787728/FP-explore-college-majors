3447041,3,B001AD54ES,"Enter the Devil (Frank Q. Dobbs, 1972)

It's been a long, long time since my experiments with illicit hallucinogens, well over two decades now, and that is not a bad thing. There are, however, times when I wish I still had access to them. And the entire length of Enter the Devil was one of those times. I get the feeling that this movie would be a complete hoot were the viewer under the influence. Dobbs, who was much better known as a writer (Gambler V: Playing for Keeps), directed four films in his lifetime, of which this is the first; it's coherent, though barely, and everyone in it's having way too good a time. As a side note, I'm not sure if it's the genesis of so many monster-movie clichs or just recycling them for our use, but a quick mental rummaging doesn't come up with any previous flicks to use a few of the conventions that pop up here. That alone may make it worth tracking down (as hard as that may be to do these days).

Story: hot grad student Leslie Culver (Irene Kelly, whose only other credited film role came in Dirty Dingus Magee, but who appeared in some of the swingin' sixties and seventies' most popular TV shows, including Star Trek and BJ and the Bear) heads to a remote area of the American southwest in order to study Satanic cult activity. She finds herself in an upright, and maybe a little uptight, conservative-Christian town. There are rumors of human sacrifice there, but as small as the town is, you gotta wonder where they're getting the bodies. In any case, hot chicks are few and far between in the middle of nowhere, so she finds herself romanced by the local hotelier ('Salem's Lot's Joshua Bryant) and the local law (stuntman, character actor, and director David S. Cass). Meanwhile, she's got some Satanic cult activity to investigate, but the closer she gets to the truth, the less the clues add up.

It's almost impossible to tell you about technical aspects of this movie almost forty years after it was released; the one extant copy known to exist, which Something Weird Video used as the master for this release, is quite degraded. If you're picking this up expecting a clean, newly-mastered print, keep waiting; this print isn't quite as bad as the one that was used to make the Shriek of the Mutilated DVD, but it's close (which makes it the second-worst print I've ever seen used as a master). The acting is about what you'd expect from an early seventies film that doesn't even make the grindhouse cut; think of it as grindhouse wannabe. All that said, even with the degradation, this is by no means an awful movie, and as I mentioned in the intro, playing ""spot the clich this movie may have invented"" is always a fun game. In fact, I was thinking of calling it a mashup of Kingdom of the Spiders and The Dunwich Horror, but the more I think about it, the more I think Kingdom of the Spiders was a much more direct spiritual descendant of this movie than I'd originally thought. (I hesitate to use the term ""rip-off"", especially given how much I love Kingdom of the Spiders, but the more I think about it, the more striking the parallels become.) In any case, one way or the other, if you run across this one in your video rental store and you're a fan of seventies Satanic Panic movies, you've gotta rent it. Everyone else, on a case-by-case basis depending on how you feel about degraded prints. ** ",1286409600,8,3363,4.517241379310345

If you come into it thinking that it's the worst movie you'll ever see, then you may find to be pleasantly surprised, just like I was when I watched Enter The Devil (1972).

Of course, it goes without saying that the movie is incredibly low budget and it shows through and through, but it still means something that I enjoyed it.

What mainly caught my eye about this film was that though I was aware of how low budget the movie actually was, I couldn't help by find myself being creeped out at different parts throughout, which is something I never expected out of a 70's Devil movie like this.",1254268800,12,804,4.45578231292517

And where could we possibly find suspects? The correct answers are: Nope and beats me. There seems no logic here except for the random killing of an assortment of victims. There is one twist at the end that is probably telegraphed a mile away, but by then I was in such a stupor you could have hung up a neon sign and I'd have missed it.

8276752,3,B001AD54ES,"This is one of those low-budget B films with unknown actors that usually are boring and substandard. After renting this for a $1.99 I viewed it and was surprised. The quality of the print is poor (filmed on 16mm and transferred to 35mm) and the color (Eastmancolor, which is usually good) has faded and needs to be digitally restored but I did find it interesting enough to watch all of it. First, the story is so-so (religious cult demands human sacrifices; people have been disappearing and turning up dead) and clich. Second, the writing was also so-so and some would be bored with it. The acting, however, was better than expected and I noted the sheriff, the doctor and the ranch/lodge owner were decent actors. The two ladies were attractive enough. Another thing that held my interest was the desert scenes, filmed in Southwest Texas near Big Bend National Park (Lajitas and Terlingua) which really would have benefited from a digital restoration. I won't give away the ending although it's predictable. So if you enjoy stories about devil cults, sacrifices, and people stranded in the desert, give it a try.",1402790400,4,1115,4.873684210526315
