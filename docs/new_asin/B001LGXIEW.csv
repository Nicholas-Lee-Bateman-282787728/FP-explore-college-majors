8318050,5,B001LGXIEW,"Some people have a spirit animal, Tamalyn Dallal has a spirit tree--the palm.  She is graceful, earthy, warm, and free, with the serenity of the statue of a goddess.  This DVD is best viewed in several sessions because it is generous in length and packed with technique and cultural insights.  Your head will explode if you try to do it all at once.  I think Tamalyn Dallal has my favorite arms on any dancer--I could watch a whole DVD just on her arm technique and I was glad there was a special section here just on hands and arms.  The Ayoub/Zar section was also particularly insightful although I could only take notes and not participate since I recently re-injured my neck.  This is a must-watch for intermediate and advanced dancers--beginners will want to get some experience under their belt before tackling this one.",1366675200,,826,4.741258741258742
8318051,5,B001LGXIEW,"I've had this dvd for quite some time and have yet to tire of working with it. Tamalyn's teaching style is gentle,  encouraging and she breaks down the moves in a way that anyone can understand and follow. I also thoroughly adore her dance style - it is sensual, graceful, flowing and all together delightful to watch. Best of all, Tamalyn is a beautiful woman with real curves  - a fact that makes this middle aged, ""well-rounded"" dancer feel at ease working with this dvd. I have many, many dvds by gorgeous, young dancers with Hollywood perfect figures and, for some reason known only to my warped psyche, I often find them slightly intimidating. (a nagging little voice in the back of my head keeps saying ""no matter how hard you practice, you will never move like that at your age"" Boy, do I wish that little voice would get laryngitis!!) Tamalyn takes things at a perfect pace for dancers of any age and shape.
One thing I particularly enjoyed about this dvd were the unique arm and hand moves Tamalyn presented. The moves are lovely and would be interesting additions to any choreography. IMHO, this dvd would be a good addition to anyone's collection and, at 2 hours in length, you get certainly get a lot of quality instruction for your money. The arms/hands and Zar sections alone are worth the price. Thanks Tamalyn!
Now I simply must get my hands on Tamalyn's ""Serious Bellydance"" dvd...",1288915200,,1399,4.659919028340081
8318052,4,B001LGXIEW,"I have had to pleasure of working with Tamalyn Dallal at Oasis dance camp, so I knew she was a quality instructor.
What struck me about this video is how very nice the background music is and how relaxing her manner while teaching these slow moves.
She teaches (what I think of as her signature) a figure eight with belly contractions, several arm movements including some I had not seen before.  Then puts all moves into combos and coreography.
This is a great video of to practice slow moves. I'm putting it on my wish list.",1261699200,,526,4.479166666666667
8318053,2,B001LGXIEW,"First of all, I love this dancer and I was so excited to get my hands on my first Tamalyn DVD. It wasn't at all what I expected. There aren't very many moves for technique options or Choreographies. I also just found a vintage
VHS tape by her called ""Serious Belly dance"" which almost identical in moves, but gives more variety and is worth having if you can find one.

This DVD really seems rushed and not very well put together. Almost looks like it was done last minute. This doesn't change the fact that she is a beautiful dancer and her students also. Maybe a re-release of this DVD would be nice",1250726400,8,601,4.31858407079646
8318054,2,B001LGXIEW,"First of all I am using my friends amazon account so even thought it says Travel Man, I am a woman and I love oriental dance.

I learned of Tamalyn from Amar Gamal and was very excited to get my hands on her book on dance which is one of the best I have seen.  Imagine my excitement when I purchased this DVD and would finally be able to see her and listen to her teach!  Unfortunately, something happened between the dances I have seen Tamalyn perform (filmed - ck out youtube)  and then this DVD.

 I actually think it is the worst DVD I have and I really was eager to view this.
The DVD is well...ok.  I could not get past the distraction of how she danced.  To me it did not flow, was not beautiful, there was no grace.  It was quite poor for someone so 'great'.  If I saw her perform this way at a club ...well I would think nothing of it, but this is Tamalyn.  She just seemed so uncomfortable that it was not something I wanted to replicate in my own dancing.
Buy her book  ...it's much better~!  Bellydancing for fitness: The Ultimate Dance Workout That Unleashes Your Creative Spirit

8318055,5,B001LGXIEW,"This is the best belly dance dvd to come out in a very long time!  Tamalyn is one of the most respected belly dance teachers around right now, with over 30 years of belly dance and teaching experience.  Her students include Bozenka, Amar Gamal, and Nathalie from Miami.

This dvd is packed with information that would be useful to advanced- beginners to professional level dancers.  The section on Belly Rolls, and the Zar are the best I've ever seen on a DVD.

I've been very frustrated with all of the new belly dance dvd's that have been released in the last year by dancers with very little teaching experience.  I'm glad to see Peko is releasing DVD's with teachers like Tamalyn and Sadie.",1231804800,7,694,4.6016260162601625
8318056,5,B001LGXIEW,"this is a very nice DVD by Tamalyn Dallal.
i would say it is for advanced beginners- there are just a couple of moves that a beginner might not know, Like belly rolls and pelvic undulations, but it's not all that hard once you go over it a couple of times.
 It has good production values and content is slowly explained and repeated frequently. The DVD has nice menus that get you to the basic sections, but not individual moves. She is in a nice studio in front of a mirror and most of the time she is filmed far enough away that we can see all her moves. there were a couple of times i wish they did not get close- i wanted to see all of her! But overall, not too distracting or choppy. The music is a background presence- she talks throughout, no voice over.
It starts with an ""Intro/warm up"", then ""Slow moves"", then ""Hands and Arms"". Then the Choreography. The choreography is in 4 parts- Slow combos, Drum Solo, Ayoub, and Finale. Then a complete performance in costume of the choreo. and another short performance. The running time is 2:05, which seems forever when you think about it, but actually went by quickly.
 Tamalyn has a calm presence and teaches slowly, which my bug some A type people out there, but i think worked well for the beginner student. I also find the Ayoub section interesting- you don't hear much about Zar anyway, much less on beginner tapes. i liked that it was not your standard cheesy performance- i think the Zar moves added some ethnic feeling to the dance. so much out there is generic American bellydance that adding different flavors was a nice touch.
All that said, I was not actually that impressed with Tamalyn final performances or her costume (i don't think she is fat, but that costume did nothing for her hips!). I guess liking her laid back teaching style did not translate into liking her laid back performance style. She was fine, but i found it tame. Maybe i am just too American in my bellydance tastes! I also wish her second performance was longer. We've already spent 2 hours with her- i want a performance thats longer than about 4 minutes!
Overall, i would give this 5 stars for beginner content and choreog., and 4 stars for intermediate practice use.",1231027200,6,2209,4.506234413965087
