1029501,3,6305459525,"I was impressed with the number of quality hit songs Madonna turned out in such a short period of time (This collection covers 1983-90). These videos being back great memories of growing up in the 1980s -- and when it comes  to presenting unforgettable visuals with pop music, they were  exemplary.
Be forewarned -- the video quality of this DVD is surprisingly  subpar. I don't know if the problem is inherent in the original masters  being 10-15 years old or not, but this DVD plays like a typical VHS copy.

Brought back memories of a ground breaking artist who was set on showing the US and the world that a woman can be as sexual as a man.  Her take me or leave me sassy spirited style set about fashion trends as well as making way for other woman who express them selves musically or sexually or art was exactly what Madonna set about to show the world.  Her acts of humanity is what made this rebels anticts tolerated by many who would just wish she would go away.  Well she did show them she is still going strong and has an edge we all love and adore. A must have classic take on Madonna's ground breaking and explicitly shocking historic videos.  You get to see controversary at its best with the Like a Prayer video that caused an uproar among christians, parental groups, and even congress that launched Pepsi into a new generation.  Pepsi of course responded by dropping Madonna and her video from it's comercial campaign.  Buy it now.",1215216000,,1123,5.245810055865922

1029870,5,6305459525,"Madonna produced numerous MTV videos; and this DVD showcases 12 of them with bonus footage of Madonna and her supporting cast performing ""Vogue"" at the 1990 MTV Awards. The quality of the image is excellent; and the sound exceeded my expectations. This DVD proves that Madonna was an unstoppable artistic force as early as 1984 when she made her ""Borderline"" video. The quality of the footage together with the soundtrack stuns me and makes me want more.

The Immaculate Collection DVD is a set of several of Madonna's earliest videos; and this DVD starts off strong with the beautiful ""Lucky Star."" Madonna dances up against a white background with merely two background dancers for much of the length of this number. Nevertheless, in ""Lucky Star"" Madonna already begins to beg and work her way into your heart not merely as a very attractive young woman but also as a legitimate artist singing, dancing and pouring her heart out. ""Borderline"" follows and the action speeds up with something of a plot going on while Madonna sings. Yes, Madonna has her man; but when a rich entertainment mogul comes along to give her opportunities the relationship between Madonna and her main man heats up in a way that isn't always very positive.

""Like A Virgin"" represents Madonna's desire to play over the top roles; during this number she dances and sings inside an empty but beautifully sculpted older European-style building. Madonna's white dress comes undone to reveal more of her legs to symbolize her being ""touched for the very first time.""

Other videos that deserve mention include the pensive ""La Isla Bonita"" with its beautiful cinematography and an extravagant Latin costume for Madonna as well as ""Papa Don't Preach"" which explores the relationship between a father and his daughter now that she's all grown up and involved with a man. ""Material Girl"" boasts a set and costume for Madonna that are clearly based on Marilyn Monroe singing ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" from the movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. In addition, there is the very painful yet all too commonplace scenario depicted in ""Oh Father."" ""Oh Father"" explores Madonna's feelings now that she is an adult woman and free of an abusive parent who terrorized her when she was just a little girl without a mother to defend her.

The DVD closes with two versions of Madonna's big hit entitled ""Vogue."" ""Vogue"" encourages people to use their imagination to make themselves attractive to themselves and to others. I like the way Madonna wedges in so neatly a tribute to some of the greatest actors who have come before her. The second version of Vogue was filmed at the 1990 MTV Awards show and is presented here from excellent camera angles. The extravagant over the top costumes combine with the singing and dancing to produce an outstanding number.

One reviewer writes that they would have liked ""Burning Up"" and ""Into the Groove"" to have been included on this DVD. I must agree; but because the rest of the DVD is so perfect I will give it five stars anyway. Some of you may prefer to give this DVD four stars because of this omission. It's a judgment call!

Overall, The Immaculate Collection documents some of Madonna's finest work during the first several years of her career in the form of video vignettes that are memorable and well executed. The cinematography shines through with clever camera angles all throughout the 13 chapters of the DVD; and the choreography leaves nothing to chance as Madonna and her crew perform intricate numbers with great energy and poise. Madonna and the rest of the cast make it look easy; but we know it isn't. But, then again, when a star like Madonna is born, the impossible can become the reality that is shown to us here on this DVD.

Enjoy!",1172707200,3,3758,4.8351477449455675

1029973,2,6305459525,"I love Madonna!!!!!  I purchased the original VHS version back when it first came out -- And now the DVD version, and the reproduction quality is REALLY POOR! The videos are blurry -- its as if they lost the original (or was not able to obtain it) and used a copy to make the DVD. For example, In the video ""Pappa Don't Preach"", in some of the ""low light"" parts, you cant even make out their faces - total silhouette... not so on the VHS version.

But there are two BIG SURPRISES on the DVD that was edited out on the VHS version ---  Madonna had (2) wardrobe malfunctions in her dance sequences in the ""Pappa Don't Preach"" video,  - two total breast shots with full nipple exposure on both!!!  Sorry Miss Jackson...Looks like Madonna did it first again!

Overall, most of the videos on the DVD were not as crisp and clear as the original VHS version.",1142208000,8,851,4.3544303797468356
1029974,5,6305459525,"if one was to ask a DVD creator ""can you make me a one hour DVD that symbolizes the 1980's"", what you'd get would be similar to this.  Madonna's Immaculate Collection video collection, originally released on VHS in 1990 to coincide with the release of the CD of the same title, and on DVD in the summer of 1999.

Madonna was without a doubt the biggest artist on MTV for quite some time, and here are twelve reasons why:

1. Lucky Star - this is the uncut extended version that differs slightly from the single edit version that got so much MTV airplay in the fall of 1984.  Plain and but sexy, with a young Madonna strutting her stuff with two backup dancers.

2. Borderline - the song that brought her to the top 10 for the ""very first time"".  An innocent youthful Madonna as a rising model whose boyfriend feels left behind.  One of the first times most of America saw her.

3. Like A Virgin - Madonna in Paris on a gondola, with a tiger-man following her.  One of her most played videos (it was #10 on MTV's MTV 500 countdown back in 1997)

4. Material Girl - An icon is born, basing itself on a classic Marilyn Monroe film sequence, Madonna became pop's ultimate sex symbol,  nice storyline too where Keith Carradine is a producer who falls for her.

5. Papa Don't Preach - fast forward a year, new haircut, less makeup, nowhere as much jewelry.  Madonna as a young woman who finds out she's pregnant and tells her father (Danny Aiello)

6. Open Your Heart - one of my favorite Madonna clips, where she works as a dancer at a sex club, while a young boy admirer watches from a distance,  is he her brother? her son?  what?!?!  whatever, the video was still fun

7. La Isla Bonita - Madonna is a lonely, religious woman who has a ""other half"" who likes to dance and party.  Be on the lookout for a really young Benicio del Toro in the video

8. Like A Prayer - she does it!!  Madonna officially makes a video that truly proves she is a video icon.  It's one of those videos that words can't describe because it has to be seen to be understood, and it is great.

9. Express Yourself - Madonna is sexy again, this time based on the classic Metropolis,  a very daring and shocking video for its time even though as the years have passed, it's rather tame

10. Cherish - one of the weakest videos of the set, but a nice return to somewhat innocence after the last two groundbreakers, Madonna meets Splash.

11. Oh Father - the most autobiographical video she'd done up to this point.  As someone who has lost my mother, I understand how Madonna feels with this song and video, a true work of art.

12. Vogue - easily the ultimate dance track of Madonna's career, a wonderfully stylish black and white video filmed during rehearsals for the Blond Ambition tour

Bonus - Vogue (1990 Video Music Awards) - another classic performance, I remember watching this as it aired.  Madonna set in the 1800's.

Hopefully one of these days, a video collection will come along that is complete and supplants both this and ""Video Collection 1993-1999"", but until that time comes, this is what you should buy, along with 93-99.  Other great collections to check out if you're a fan of this era include Cyndi Lauper's ""Twelve Deadly Cyns"", Janet Jackson's ""Design Of A Decade"", Eurythmics' ""Greatest Hits"", Olivia Newton-John's ""Video Gold 1"" and ""Video Gold 2"", Prince's ""The Hits Collection"" and Michael Jackson's ""HIStory On Film Vol. 1"".  Along with ""Video Collection 1993-1999"" by Madonna, which covers the 90's.",1136419200,10,3500,4.522292993630574
1029975,4,6305459525,"First and foremost, the idea of DVD technology is to take advantage of the considerable space.  With the amount of early Madonna videos around, this DVD should have included them.  While what's on offer are fantastic, it is not really worth the money for only 13 videos.  Missing videos (which we all know and love) include:

- Burnin' Up

- Dear Jessie

- Justify my Love

- Crazy for You

- Live to Tell

- Causing a Commotion

- True Blue

That is seven videos that would have made this a nice collection of 20 songs, instead of only 13. Do we really need two versions of ""Vogue"" when we could have perhaps got one of the above?

All the videos from the early years are certainly sure to please. Thats not to say that Madonna isn't still hotter than ice in ALL of her videos, but these are the ones I watched when I was little. I truly enjoy this DVD, and unlike pop chicks of today, which may be hot, Madonnas music was always alright to listen to. She has a very cool voice, and well written songs. She is a bad -ass!

1029977,5,6305459525,"Madonna's first music video compilation, ""The Immaculate Collection"" was released simultaneously with its companion audio album in November 1990. The track list between the two differed a bit: the video boasted ""Oh Father"" (which didn't make it onto the hits album) as well as her performance of ""Vogue"" at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. Also, the new tracks ""Justify My Love"" - which did not make it to the DVD because of its explicit content - and ""Rescue Me"", which were included on the CD, are not on the DVD. While the album scored #2 on the US Billboard charts, on the American DVD charts, this scored #1, and remained on the charts for 76 year.

""The Immaculate Collection"" is an excellent DVD, packed full of great Madonna videos, that have became history. While not as good as the CD - probably due to the fact that some tracks are missed off the DVD that were put onto the CD - it's still a brilliant buy and a worthy purchase indeed. ""Lucky Star"" is available as an extended version here, that is not available on the VHS, and the live version of ""Vogue"" is not on the VHS either, so I suppose we get some bonuses here! My favourite videos are ""Material Girl"", ""Open Your Heart"" and ""Oh Father"". While ""Like A Prayer"" is definately in my top three favourite Madonna songs ever, the video just isn't as good as the three mentioned above. This music video collection is definately recommended to all Madonna fans!

My top three ""The Immaculate Collection"" pics (based on the video - not the song):-
3) Material Girl
2) Open Your Heart
1) Oh Father",1127347200,2,1930,4.637426900584796
1029978,5,6305459525,"When it comes to music videos, nobody can top Madonna. With over 40 videos to her credit, she is the queen of MTV. This 1990 video collection, titled the same as her 1990 greatest hits collection, may seem dated, but it's a great memento of Madonna at her peak.

Here is a sypnosis of each video.

""Lucky Star"" - One of Madonna's best videos. I love her look, she's beautiful in this video. The song is great and the dancing is unbelievable (the good kind) 5/5

""Borderdline"" - an underrated video for an underrated song. Madonna plays the role of a fashion model upset with her lover. Like another reviewer mentioned, I'm impressed by the black and white transitions. Once again, Madonna looks beautiful. 5/5

""Like A Virgin"" - an MTV classic. Whether she's traipsing around Venice in a wedding dress or writhing around seductively in a gondola, this is a classic video. 5/5

""Material Girl"" - another classic. This is where all those Marilyn Monroe comparisons arose. Madonna never looked better than she does here, emulating Monroe in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"". The song is great, too. 5/5

""Papa Don't Preach"" - this video grew on me. I like the song and the video is atmospheric, but I really didn't like the way Madonna looked in the video. But she acted out the song well and I liked Danny Aiello. 4/5

""Open Your Heart"" - classic Mafdonna! Madonna plays a stripper who seduces a minor while singing this sensual classic. A great video for a great song. When I first saw the video, I envied that kid immensely (I used to be infatuated with Madonna). 5/5

""La Isla Bonita"" - Madonna looks perfect for this video, a Spanish tinged number about love found and lost. Sad song and an extremely atmospheric video. 5/5

""Like A Prayer"" - this classic video was also very controversial because of the scene with the burning crosses and the depcition of the black Jesus. I look beyodn those, and find an MTV classic. I generally don't favor Madonna as a brunette, but she looks great here.

""Express Yourself"" - a very sexy video. This is the video Madonna crawls around like a cat in a skin tight green dress, lies naked chained to a bed, and grabs her crotch wile wearing a double breasted suit. Need I say more?

""Cherish"" - this one may be my personal favorite. Madonna sings this beautiful love song while on a beach. The scenes with the mermaid baby are especially sweet, and Madonna looks stunning. 5/5

""Oh Father"" - like ""Papa Don't Breach"". A sombering real life tale of child abuse much like Pat Benatar's ""Hell Is For Children"" and Suzanne Vega's ""Luka"", this is excellent in showing the pain Madonna went through as a child with her father. 5/5

""Vogue"" - yet another all time classic. The dancing is amazing and the song is catchy and unforgettable. 5/5

""Vogue"" (live performance from the 1990 MTV Awards Show) - good performances, great costumes.

Though it leaves off some great videos (I miss the one they made for ""Burnin' Up""), this is an excellent Madonna collection. Defintely belongs in any dvd collection.",1122681600,3,3028,4.665413533834586
1029979,5,6305459525,"I love all the videos from this collection.

Lucky Star:  Madonna is cute and her hair is tied up by a pair of tights.  I guess this is when she was trying to start setting a trend for herself. All girls just wanted this look I remember I was 9. The dancing is OK and she winks at you. She wears the classic black lace gloves and the black bracelets so 80's!!Not the best song but hey give her a break its her first album.

Borderline: I love this song. The video is cool too with her spraying the walls with spray paint. She looks really pretty in this one too and her hair it yet again pulled up with those stockings. She is in a studio being photographed by a guy. Later she sprays the walls with a heart and a arrow going through it. There a story in between it with her and another male.

Like A Virgin: This song launched her into superstardom and the video went to number 1. Not too bad a song. I rememeber this song  caused the first controversy in M's career because of its lyrics.  The setting is in Venice, Italy and Madonna sings while riding on the gondola going through a river.  She also sings in scenes where she is wearing a wedding dress.  There are lions in the video and they play a part in a sound from the song. It's wicked cool and I just love it.

Material Girl: My favorite video so far in the earlier career of M. She is dressed up as her idol Marilyn Monroe ( wears Monroes dress) and sings about material things while guys sorround her and give her diamonds, pearls, jewerly and other lavish materialistic things.  The video is reinactes a scene/song  in Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend, from the Marilyn Monroe movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.  I like the pink gown. She would later meet her future first husband Sean Penn after the video.

Papa Dont Preach: This video went to number 1 too. Another great video thats stirred up more controversy about keeping your baby or not. It was filmed in New York City and during the story line there are  a few 15 second or so  clips of Madonna dancing. The dancing is  breathtaking and you can see she is a professional dancer. It also starts Danny Alieo as her father. The father is not too happy about her situation but they make up at the end and its so sweet.

Open Your Heart: This video also went to number 1. Madonna is wearing a black wig but takes it off and performs in a peep show. This video introduces the cone bras.  Great performance here she just looks so nice an lean. At the end she leaves because she doesn't like what she does as we are made to believe and kisses a little kid whose is inspired by her dancing.  People thought that was contoversial too ( the peck on the kids lips) . They both dance of into the sunset where she is fully dressed without the wig.

La Isla Bonita: This video starts off with Madonna sitting in chair. Her hair is cut short and she looks like Joan Of Arc. She sings some versus of this song in this scene. Madonna is then dressed in a  beautful Spanish dress. Her hair is back to being a brunette again. She continues to sings and dances around young Spanish guys.

Like A Prayer: This video went to number 1. Her natural  brunette hair color is back. The most controversial video of the 80's that deals with racism, stigmatas, religion, and a black Jesus.  Madonna kisses a black Jesus and witnesses a murder of a white woman which is blamed on a black man.  We see Madonna hands bleeding from wounds caused by stigmatas and how the wounds heal on their own spontaneously.  The best parts are Madonna singing in the field while the crosses burn behind her and her singing with the choir in the church. This video caused an obvious uproar by the Catholic church. I do not see the controversy in the video. Its one of my favorite and I love it. It's also very emotional to me.

Express Yourself: We see men working really hard in the rain. We then see Madonna carrying her kitten around. Then we see her chained naked to a bed probably preventing her from being liberated.  We then see her in a beautiful blue suit opening it up to reveal her lingirie underneath and then she grabs her cr*th."". Superb dancing in this scene. This is probably where Madonnas raunchy journey begann. It is similar to a scene from he movie Metropolis. A truley amazing video though.

Cherish: Cute video with Madonna playing in the sun and sand. This was also filmed in black and white. There are men in the ocean who jumped up and it is revealed that they are mermen. She holds a child and you can see how she develops a strong bond with her.

Oh Father: A  beautiful song and sad video.  It shows a child playing in the snow and then being yelled by her father.  The little girl goes to her mothers funeral. The girl is Madonna when she was young. It also shows Madonna grown up and then abused by her male partner. The video also shows in other scenes how Madonna was effected by these events later in her life. The video is filmed in black and white.

Vogue: This video also went to number 1. Filmed in black and white no video gets better than this. The dancing is great and very well done and we get to see Madonna with the long pointed bras.  Her two backup  dancers are in this one too and so are some of her other male dancers from the Blonde Ambition Tour. They seem to show what the 30 -40 era was as she mentions legendary females names.

Vogue Live is from the 1990 VMA. Madonna is dressed up as Marie Antoinette and sings with her 2 back dancers and her dancers from the Blinde Ambition tour. She lip sunk this but who cares she was great and this is a great added bonus.

I would highly recommend these videos they are all great,  entertaining to watch, and talks about and provokes questions on all aspects of life. The ones that are missing that I wish were included are Burning Up, Crazy For, Into The Groove, True Blue, and the beautiful Live To Tell.",1118188800,,5871,4.292196007259528
1029980,5,6305459525,"Madonna wraps up the first eigth years of her career on this video. There are alot of memorable videos such as Material Girl, Open you heart, Lucky Star, Oh Father etc. There is also her performance of Vogue at the MTV VMAs 1990. It's cool to see her dance on stage with all her gay/queen dancers. Who take the cake on stage.

 But the following videos were forgotten: Into the Groove (the original vidoe, and not the tour show)Everybody, Burning up, Crazy for you, Dress you up, True Blue, Live to tell, Whos' that Girl, Dear Jesse and Justify my Love.",1116979200,,553,4.465346534653466
1029981,3,6305459525,"Those expecting a companion piece to the ""TIC"" compact disc will be disappointed.  Why this disc has only 11 of the 17 songs from the CD is a mystery, considering that they could have fit the rest on the DVD with room to spare.  For the record, the missing vids are Holiday, Into The Groove, Crazy For You, Live To Tell, Justify My Love.

There wasn't a video for Rescue Me, but videos were made for a few songs that aren't on the TIC CD (and which aren't on this DVD either): Burning Up, True Blue, Who's That Girl, and Gambler.

The Material Girl's video handlers also bungled the second collection.  For some reason it's subtitled ""1993-1999"", meaning that it leaves out the three big hits from 1992's Erotica album (Deeper And Deeper, This Used To Be My Playground and Erotica) while including 3 vids from that album that were filmed in 1993 (Fever, Bad Girl and Rain, none of which was nearly the success that the omitted songs were!).

For more than a decade, the premiere of every Madonna video was an Event-with-a-capital-E, a phenomenon which only Michael Jackson could match, and which her contemporaries like Prince, The Cars, Duran Duran, Tom Petty and Peter Gabriel could only dream about.  Hopefully Warner can go back to the vaults and emerge with a two-disc collection that's not only immaculate but comprehensive.",1111881600,,1330,4.731601731601732
1030031,4,6305459525,"I've had the video & CD of this for years now, so was happy to get the DVD for Christmas, but disappointed at the same time. My video's version of Like A Prayer was probably worn out, but as I hadn't watched the video in years, a lot of it was new to me. But it's also disappointing, how a few of the classics on the album are missed off the DVD.

For example Crazy For You (a particular favourite of mine after Like A Prayer), Into The Groove, Live To Tell, Justify My Love & Rescue Me are all missing. Instead in their place, are Oh Father, a song I'd previously never heard of, and an MTV awards performance of Vogue. I definitely think the missing songs should have been added on too.

As I've said already, I love Like A Prayer, and started my passion for having black hair when I was young, as I wanted to look like Madonna when I was young. I never understood this video when I was young, but for some reason it struck a chord with me. I understand more of it now I'm older, but some things which were fussed over in the press when it originally came out, aren't really portrayed that much in the video. Sure, the black Jesus is there, but Madonna & him getting down & dirty on the altar is only implied. You'd think the press would have got their facts right! I also love the choir in this, it adds a whole other dimension to the video.

After watching this right the way through, I've also discovered I LOVE Oh Father, coming a close third after Like A Prayer and Crazy For You. It's a black & white video, and Madonna is brilliant in it, from showing her mother's death, to the way her father dealt with it, and how things turned out. This video also struck a chord with me, and left me feeling very emotional afterwards, much as Crazy For You does.

The last video on this is an MTV awards performance of Vogue, with Madonna and her dancers dressed up in fancy Victorian clothes. Despite the fact it's glaringly obvious Madonna's lip-synching, it's all good, as it shows just how far Madonna will go (and how much further she's gone in recent years) to try and shock people. Her male dancers disappear under her skirts, and grabbing her chest at random points throughout the song, and the dancing's fantastic.

Ask any female pop star around at the moment, who influenced them and made them become a singer, they'll say without hesitation, Madonna. They're hardly likely to say Cher are they?",1105833600,8,2403,4.354910714285714
1030032,4,6305459525,"Madonna was one of the quintessential stars of the MTV era.  Artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince made good use of the form, but Madonna's entire career was built upon smart collaborator choices and a chameleon image which makes her even more of an industry unto herself than the other two.

Not all of these videos are great, or even good.  But two things are certain:  a) They served as mini-fashion shows for whatever persona Madonna was trying to project at the time, and b) the best videos on this collection are some of the best videos of all time.

First let's get the bad points over with.  ""Papa Don't Preach"", while a great (and daring) pop single, is given a camembert visual treatment.  Danny Aiello was a good choice to play the ""papa"" in question, but cheesy jump-cuts (as if the director had just discovered the nouvelle vague) and a flat-out inexplicable performance segment ruin the video.  The performance footage is the laziest kind, Madonna looking into the camera and shaking around, but the slutty, cleavage-crazy costume and horrible choreography merely serve to overturn the innocent ""pregnant girl"" image she projects in the narrative segments, and Madonna's attempt at emoting merely reminds us how wretched she is as an actress.  ""Like a Prayer"" was controversial but not much else, a promising series of concepts wasted, never developed, and ""Like a Virgin"" is just a concept-less exploitation of a nice-looking location, horrendously boring especially on rewatches.

But when Madonna hits her peaks in music video, she's every bit as good at it (and arguably more complex thematically) than Michael Jackson.  ""Vogue"" is an acknowledged classic, its tone and artistic presentation unique in music-video history; the dance sequences are fabulous and unlike any other, getting across a decadence which suits Madonna's persona perfectly.  ""Oh Father"" is her pinnacle, a simple yet moving story with perfect rhythm, superhumanly beautiful photography and Citizen Kane-inspired dissolves.  ""Express Yourself"" is probably her most representative video, almost arrogant in its raw physicality and over-the-top setting.  With the above videos (as well as other masterpieces such as Aerosmith's ""Janie's Got a Gun""), director David Fincher had established himself as the king of music-video, laying the path for his illustrious film career ahead.  No surprise that Fincher remains the only music-video director who graduated with complete success to features; his videos are cinematic like no other.  And the themes explored in these videos -- deviant sexuality, parental neglect, sorrow, idolatry, solitude -- are unusually sophisticated for the format.

Aside from the above classics, there are also a couple of slices of guilty pleasure -- the buoyant fiesta of ""La Isla Bonita"", the blatant Marilyn Monroe tribute in ""Material Girl"" (still Madonna's most famous on-film image), and the cheesy yet endearing ""Cherish"".  The late Herb Ritts had only one visual style for both his photographs and his music videos, and his video work is almost always devoid of narrative, but his style works within its own limited confines, and ""Cherish"" comes across just like Janet Jackson's ""Love Will Never Do (Without You)"", more like an intimate photo album of an artist than a motion picture.

Finally, we have the MTV Music Video Awards performance of ""Vogue"".  Compared with the MTV performance by Michael Jackson (included on his HIStory DVD), Madonna positively kicked Jackson's behind.  Where Jackson's ""medley"" performance was repetitive, overlong and messy, Madonna's was precise, lavish and fit the song perfectly.  A certain sense of cold manipulation does creep in (you know what reaction she's looking for when the dancers squeeze her breasts and when she lifts her skirt), but nevertheless the overall performance is a classic just for the choreography.

I've never cared for Madonna's post-1994 videos -- my interest in her video work stopped with ""Bad Girl"" and ""This Used to Be My Playground"" -- but this collection is a keeper.  Even if Madonna's '80s videos weren't as consistently groundbreaking or enjoyable as Michael Jackson's, her best work scales some remarkable heights.",1105142400,2,4211,5.2788605697151425
1030033,5,6305459525,"This DVD covers the first part 10 years of Madonna's career up until 1990. Even touhg she could not be your cup of tea is undeniable that SHE is the queen of videos, since her very early efforts such as Lucky Star and Borderline until her elaborate videos in Vogue and Express Yoourself.

My favorite videos in this compilation are;

Material Girl.- Her homage to Marylin Monroe, she looks very sophisticated and sexy.

Like a Prayer.- Like a little movie with gospel and everything.

Express Yourself.- Futuristic, it looks that this was an expensive video with a lot of stuff included for an excellent song.

Cherish.- A very simple and yet very sexy video, the black and white filiming contribute to the eroticism of it.

Vogue.- Classic video for a classic song, this video was one of the top 5 videos of all time and it clear why, very 40s, very old Hollywood.

Vogue (Live at 1990 MTV Awards).- This performance is worth the cost of the dvd alone, is classic and very impresive, her old England theme with custome and elaborate love dancing made this a classic performance. Since the beginnig when she appears to an enthusiastic crowd until the very end all looks perfect.

A must for any Madonna or pop lover fan.",1104537600,,1220,4.641860465116279
1030034,4,6305459525,"The collection is a decent overview of her 80s era. But to leave ""Holiday"" off, even a live version makes no sense considering it is one of her biggest hits.

I would have loved for Warners to have taken the time into making a far more padded collection of the woman whose music videos played a huge factor in her success.  But Warners has put little effort into releasing a lot of their video collections on DVD. Look how long it took to put out ""Goodfellas"" properly. Either it's not put out at all (Pretenders, Dire Straits), or what is put out is essentially the VHS version transferred to DVD (Van Halen, Prince). They have a hell of a catalog of music that they seemed more active in when videodiscs and home video first came out.

I would love to see Criterion do a 2 DVD box (as they did with the Beastie Boys, one-time opening act for Madonna) set of all of her videos and some of the more famous (and infamous) live performances. Considering Luc Besson, Herb Ritts, hubby Guy Ritchie, Mark Romanek, and countless other names have made some of the most memorable videos EVER, it would make sense to put them out the way Madonna's career has been, loud, in your face, and uncompromising.

Little of the soundtrack songs are on here, almost all of which aren't even on the movie DVDs (""Into The Groove""  from ""Desperately Seeking Susan"",  ""Crazy For You"" and ""Gambler"" from ""Vision Quest"", ""Who's That Girl"" and ""Causing a Commotion"" from ""Who's That Girl"", ""Live To Tell"" from ""At Close Range"", however ""Vogue"" from Dick Tracy is here...""Santa Baby"" from ""A Very Special Christmas"" is also missing. Also missing for no good reason is the controversial ""Justify My Love"".And where the heck is ""True Blue""? Maybe they can ""easter egg"" the Pepsi ad in there somewhere, as well as her appearance on SNL with Mike Myers as Wayne..too classic ""NOT"" to be on there).

""Extras"" could have included ""Burning Up"", ""Everybody"", and ""Dear Jessie"" rather than just the live ""Vogue"". I think the ""Like A Virgin"" performance from '85 would have been the one to include.

It sounds as good as the CD.

The videos that do make it on here still make it worth the purchase, and anyone who likes her music from the 80s will love it. The videos are the more memorable ones of her 80s output.  But as a ""greatest hits"" it's very sparse and basic. This would be fine as a combo CD/DVD package as is, but not as a video collection.

It gets 4 stars from me because you are getting some great videos without any filler, even though some of the videos could be ""cleaned up"" a bit. I think for the fan of 80s music and early music videos it's essential. You do see her emerging as an artist through watching it, and the videos get better as you go. But I think that some people will have their expectations lowered by what's NOT on there more than what IS.",1099612800,,2837,4.478682170542636

1030036,3,6305459525,"I adore Madonna's early music and respect her influence; sorry if I don't seem like a big fan with this review.  I have to be honest, but I found this disc to be a bit wanting for surprises.  Yes, there are a dozen or so excellent video hits as seen on MTV throughout the 1980's, but the allure of the DVD format is the extra features, and there are none at all.  Overall, the picture quality is decent (better so with the newer videos) and the sound is very good.  Also positive:  the video of ""Lucky Star"" is the extended one, and the live version of ""Vogue"" is a classic.  At least I now have good DVD recordings of hits that I'll enjoy watching to bring back some fond memories of a fun decade in dance/pop music.

The major disappointment is that, with a run time of 60 minutes, this disc had the potential to include many more video hits that were just as interesting and fun to watch.  From the first album, ""Burning Up"" and ""Holiday"" are not in this collection.  Neither is ""Dress You Up"" from the ""Like a Virgin"" LP, and the same with ""True Blue"" and ""Live to Tell"" off the ""True Blue"" album, not to mention various others from live performances and movies.  The good news is that four of five videos from ""Like a Prayer"" are included (lone exception is ""Dear Jessie"") and that both the studio and live (MTV Music Awards) versions of ""Vogue"" are included.

1030106,5,6305459525,"Madonna and music videos go together like love and marriage. Madonna was ahead of the game right when MTV started, always coming up with the freshest music videos. This collection of of her best vdeos is truly supreme. Let's go through a quick run - through of the videos.
""Lucky Star"" is a cute video. Madonna likes lovely and the dancing is superb. It was her first classic video. I love the black and white intro when Madonna pulls down the sunglasses.
""Borderline"" is a very cute video. Madonna plays a fashion model. I love the transistion between black and white and color. And once again, Madonna looks gorgeous. Also, in this video, Madonna vaguely resembles D.J. from ""Full House"".
""Like A Virgin"" was without a doubt the video tha cemented her. I love the scenes in Venice when she's dancing in the gondolla. Never cared for that lion man at the end, though.
""Material Girl"" was the one that started the comparisons to Marilyn Monroe, maybe because Madonna wore the same dress that Monroe wore in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" in 1953. It is an excellent video, and the one whose set she met future husband and recent Oscar winner Sean Penn on.
""Papa Don't Preach"" I didn't like that much. I don't know if it's because of the way Madonna wore her hair in the video or I'm just not a big Danny Aiello fan, but there's something about this video that I don't like. Great song, though.
""Open Your Heart"" gets right back on track. The idea of Madonna as a stripper wooing a young boy into a peep show was perfect. And Madonna's hair is beautiful.
""La Isla Bonita"" is my least favorite video. I just don't like the way she looks in the video. I never thought she looked all that good as a brunette, and here is no exception (the ""Like A Prayer"" video is, but I'll get to that later). Killer dress though, and a good song.
""Like A Prayer"" caused a ton of controversy when it was released. And why wouldn't it, what with its burning crosses, interracial love affair nd its depiction of Jesus being black? But when you look past all this, it's really a great video. And Madonna looks so beautiful. And about her being a brunette, she looks good with it in this video. In fact, I think the blackhair was required for the video.
""Express Yourself"" is a very sensuous video, especially the scene with Madonna naked and chained to the bed. The ending where Madonna grabs her crotch is really pretty funny.
""Cherish"" is a very charming video. Shot in black and white (at least I think it is), Madonna stands on the beach, getting soaked by water and yet singing about the sweet love she owns. A nice change of pace from the racier videos on the dvd.
""Oh Father"" I really don't remember, so I'll skip it. I remember it was pretty boring, though. And I hated the song.
""Vogue"" is such a great video. It's too beautiful to describe in words. All I can say is that Madonna looks gorgeous.
The live performance of ""Vogue"" is really good. I reccommend this dvd to all Madonna fans who don't already own it.",1078531200,6,2994,4.4753199268738575
1030107,5,6305459525,"""The Immaculate Collection"" is a compilation of some of Madonna's music videos from 1984-1990.  Every video answers why she's the queen of pop and of MTV.  The catchy songs answer why she was the biggest selling female artist of the 1980's.  She knows how to keep many interested.  Her dance moves, sexuality, and outrageousness keeps many watching her every move, wondering what she'll do next.  Her brilliantly creative outlook is expressed in every video.  Such risque moves deserves her tremendous respect.  No female before her was performing such daring moves and attitudes.  She defines girl power.  Her variey and her ability to always brainstorm new and original ideas amazes everyone.  The moments many think she's done everything, she always does something new and mindblowing.
Madonna's videos are unforgettable.  Whether she's dressing like Marilyn Monroe(""Material Girl""), a 1940's actress(""Express Yourself""), a mermaid(""Cherish""), a street-wise woman(""Borderline""), or herself(many of them), her creativity starts a fashion.  Many modern-day artists have impersonated and/or found inspiration in these videos.  However, none have reached anywhere close to her style and quality.  The stand-out video is ""Vogue"", which VH1 named the second greatest music video ever made.  This pays tribute to old-time Hollywood actresses, and it introduces the audience to her gay affiliations.  Her MTV Music Awards performance of this song is also included.  The dancers and she are dressed in 1600's European style.
""The Immaculate Collection"" DVD is important material for the Madonna fan.  This will keep many entertained for a long time.  As every song of hers will be classics, these videos will do the same.  These songs are also featured on the CD; therefore, the two compilations will be a fun combination.",1071878400,,1816,5.4640287769784175

The two went hand in hand as a celebration of Madonna's incredible achievements from 1983-1990, and sold by the million. The Immaculate Collection CD sold inexcess of 22 million worldwide and is considered by many to be one of the most accomplished and essential greatest hits collections of all-time. The album was so successful that the video of the same name often gets left in the shade, which is a great shame as it contains some of the most thought-provoking and controversial works of music video art of all-time. In this review of The Immaculate Collection video, I will be rating the videos out of ten - firstly on the song, then on the video...

The Immaculate Collection opens with Lucky Star (9/10, 7/10). This amazing dance/pop song was taken from Madonna's self-titled debut album in 1984. The video isn't very good, but music videos didn't need to be in the early days of MTV. It basically consists of a white background as Madonna dances around with a few dancers. We then move onto Borderline (10/10, 9/10), a much more accomplished video. The video features Madonna aimlessly walking around the streets following the man of her dreams - yet everytime she tries to get with him, he walks away. The next video is Like A Virgin (10/10, 10/10). This was the song that made Madonna the superstar she is today with its cheeky and saucy suggestions. Madonna prances around on a gondola in Venice trying desperately to shock the world and maintain a sex-kitten image - one that would have a much greater impact seven years later! This video is followed by Material Girl (10/10, 10/10). Madonna was being compared a lot to Marilyn Monroe in the early 1980's, so she decided to encorporate this into the video for Material Girl. She re-inacts Monroe's famous scene from the 1950's classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. (...)tube gown and showered in jewellery, she is followed around by a legion of men. A very good video - and a classic, well it is Madonna! The next three videos are from Madonna's third album, 1986's True Blue. Papa Don't Preach (10/10, 10/10) is the fifth video on The Immaculate Collection. This worldwide No. 1 smash dealt with the teenage angst and heart-ache of an unwanted pregnancy. Madonna sells the song from the bottom of her heart and the video is absolutely superb - definetly one of Madonna's greatest songs/videos ever. This video is followed by Open Your Heart (9/10, 8/10). This controversial video shows Madonna as a stripper in a peep show on a chair. This was the first time the world got to see Madonna's now legendary conical bra on full show with its gold tassles! The seventh video is La Isla Bonita (10/10, 9/10). This Spanish-influenced classic track has some beautiful lyrics and superb beats. The video is set in Spain (or Latin America) and sees Madonna in a stunning red and black polka-dot Flamenco dress. Probably the most relaxing and beautifully produced video of them all...

The Immaculate Collection continues in true Madonna style with the video to Like A Prayer (10/10, 10/10). Easily the most controversial music video of the 1980's, Madonna decided to explore themes such as a black Jesus, stigmata, interracial kissing, burning crosses and statues crying blood in her video for Like A Prayer. The controversy surrounding the video only saw record sales soar as the Like A Prayer album shifted more than 15 million copies worldwide. The video recently landed at No. 2 in VH1 USA's 100 Greatest Videos Of All-Time, behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. We then move onto Express Yourself (10/10, 10/10). This huge video cost $1 million to make and was the second most expensive music video of the 1980's - second only to (again!) Michael Jackson's Thriller. In the video, Madonna is the boss of a huge company as she sits up on her pedestal with her cats, smoking cigarettes, dancing while taking the mick out of Mr Jackson (crotch grabbing, ahem!) and exploring her sexuality by getting what she wants - a real girl power video that shows women can be all the things men get praised for. The tenth video on The Immaculate Collection is Cherish (10/10, 9/10). Taken from the Like A Prayer album, this superb song is deserving of praise all-round because of Madonna's sunlight and valentine lyrics on an otherwise dark and mysterious album. The video is black and white and was directed by legendary photographer Herb Ritts, who went on to direct other famous beach videos such as that of Britney Spears' Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. This video is followed by another black and white video, Oh Father (9/10, 8/10). This was another controversial video, condemned for its child violence. The song is about Madonna as a child and how her strict upbringing often caused her misery and pain. The final video in this collection is Vogue (10/10, 10/10) - another black and white video! This song is officially Madonna's biggest selling single to date - a record that still stands 13 years later! Madonna is seen in her famous conical bra and pays homage to 16 of her idols. The video also came in a No. 8 on VH1 UK's list of the 100 Greatest Videos Of All-Time.

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

I often regard The Immaculate Collection CD and video to be one of the most essential pieces of merchandise around. Just like the Erotica album and the Sex book, this collection is a must for every Madonna fanatic. To miss out on this video collection would be to ignore some of the most thought-provoking, celebrated and controversial works of music video art of all-time. Anyway, The Immaculate Collection is a must have for all you mad fans on Madonna - buy it now...from Amazon of course!",1037491200,12,5723,4.783619817997978
1030110,5,6305459525,This is the perfect chronicle of Madonna through the 80's to 90's. Wish the DVD had extras like unseen footage or still photos or comments by the director or Madonna.  The live version of Vogue at the MTV awards is Madonna at her best!!!,1027468800,,237,4.386363636363637

1030112,5,6305459525,"I am a huge Madonna fan; therefore I thoroughly enjoyed this video collection.  I don't want to say much though (I really don't feel like I have to).  Madonna has been an undeniable influence to anyone who has ever been witness to her work.  Even if you do not call yourself a Madonna fan you know that at some point or another you found yourself liking one of her songs or videos!!  Proof once more as Siskel and Eibert put it - ""Madonna is every inch a Superstar!""  So if you don't follow Madonna's career, than at the very least you can enjoy yourself by watching a master entertainer/superstar at work, VIOLA!! ENJOY!!",987033600,,622,4.469026548672566
1030113,5,6305459525,"Here are the first basic 12 Madonna videos (it's missing a few) and a fabulous live performance:
Lucky Star - on this DVD, you get the rare  extended version not available on the VHS version! Very cool,  indeed!
Borderline - Aw, Mo's first storyline video. She's so cute with  her black and white striped hat and spray painting the white car. A  classic!
Like A Virgin - Men are beasts. Isn't that fun? ;) It's Mo  frolicking in a gondola in Venice and looking sexy with her own brown mane.  And the lion tongue pounding along with the rhythm? I remember being 8  years old and laughing crazily at that. Those were the times, weren't  they?
Material Girl - Ok, although Maddy may hate this song, you have to  admit that the video is pretty groovy. My favorite is in the beginning when  the guy brings her a necklace and we get to hear her talking to her pal  about how she's not into material things. Can we say,  ""sassy""?
Papa Don't Preach - I have to admit, I hate this song.  I don't know why, but I do. The video? Eh, to have a baby, to not have a  baby. Blah, blah, blah. I'm also not a Danny Aiello fan, so I can't say  much about this clip. Although many like it, I'm not one of them.
Open  Your Heart - I really like this song, and Madonna looks cool in her black  wig, but I'm just not down with this whole short blond hair thing. She  looks horrible, although this was our first introduction to those infamous  cone bras. This is another 'blah' video, imho, but it's okay once in  awhile.
La Isla Bonita - Maddy looks great in this one with her natural  brown hair color and this song is just a great. One thing: who's that ugly  man she's singing to? *L* Just a question. A cool video, though!
Like A  Prayer - I know that everyone loves this video - and hey! I'm with them.  This is such a coolified video. My favorite part is when she's dancing in  the field with the burning crosses because she looks great, and I love when  she's in the church with the choir. Another classic!
Express Yourself -  The chains, the cat, the sexy models, the scary bald guy, and that sexy  suit she wears whilst grabbing her crotch. What a brilliant video! I love  it, one of Mo's best ever.
Cherish - This is a fun and carefree video  that is really airy and a joy to watch. Watching Mo showing off as if she's  being on a home video is just classic and the mer people are quite sexy!  Very cool!
Oh Father - This is a really sad video, and shows Madonna's  childhood and how it reflected her adult life. She truly looks beautiful as  she's singing in the snow and when she's in the confessional. A wonderful  video.
Vogue - Madonna's grande masterpiece. I'm sure you've seen it  about a million times, and you're probably aware it made close to the top  of all the ""Best Video"" Countdowns at the end of the millennium.  Very sophisticated and timeless.
Vogue (Live from the 1990 MTV VMA's) -  one of Madonna's best remembered performances. She's obviously  lip-synching, but this proves that she puts on a fabulous show and you're  not even thinking about the technicalities (or lack thereof). If you've  been burned out on the other 12 selections, then make this your main  objective - it's classic if ever there was one in Madonna's musical  history.",967852800,106,3249,4.343333333333334
1030114,5,6305459525,"Although it is not a complete collection of her videos since her early beginnings, Madonna's ""Immaculate Collection,"" features some of her greatest videos that made her an MTV darling throughout the 1980's.  From her very first video, ""Borderline,"" to the last video before  her pre-""Erotica"" days, ""Vogue,"" Madonna truly captures  the essence of an empowered woman in Reagan/Bush years that were known as  the 80's.
While the video and sound quality are great, I was  disappointed that this video collection omiited two of my favorite videos:  ""Burning Up,"" and ""Into the Groove."" Both songs are  very strong in beats, and it is a disgrace that the the compilation's  producers omitted these videos. While many might see ""Into the  Groove,"" as being some type of music video-infomercial promoting  Madonna's 1985 feature film debut, ""Desperately Seeking Susan,"" I  would still have included it because it was her greatest dance song that  decade.
The other thing I disliked, that unlike many music video  compilations available on DVD, there is not an option for the lyrics to  Madonna's song to be played onscreen. This is one feature I feel that most  music video compilations on DVD should have.
Madonna still reigns  supreme, however check out this collection to see how she became the idol  she is today. You'll see the transformation right in front of your eyes.",964915200,,1369,5.067264573991031
