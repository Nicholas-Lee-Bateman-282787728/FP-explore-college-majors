This time in Israel. Virtually every western country in the world has the problem, not only us, and this film is about an El Al flight attendent coming home from a trip only to find her Chinese maid gone, but without her son and after realizing she has been deported, how to get him back to her in china. Another example of great cinema not available in the USA.",1299369600,3,534,4.35
8306105,5,B001GMFAWO,"I just saw this film, after finding a really poor set of subtitles online that you can merge with the film. It was way too complicated and I had to watch it on my computer b/c the DVDs from overseas don't work on American DVD players.
I would have loved to see it by renting it or buying it instead. That being said it was a terrific film. The characters were believable, flawed, and human... and best of all normal, but placed in an abnormal situation.
I would hate to spoil the plot in the review so my suggestion is, if you can manage to see this movie then please see it. I know it has played at some film festivals, so perhaps you can see it that way. Or perhaps it will someday be available to American viewers.",1297728000,,717,4.16546762589928
