2229469,5,B0007PAMII,"I've been wanting to write a review for this movie for a long time, and here i am. This movie, at least to me, is powerful. I understand some people might not either 'get it' (even though the movie is quite straight-forward really) or might not like it due to it's content and what it's basically about. There are many things about this movie that i really cannot fault at all..from the brilliant acting, the way the two central characters plan the 'attack' i guess you could say and basically slide further and further away from reality, to the powerful way the movie ends..this movie is one of my favorite movies now, and it's a crime that it's not more well-known.

The story follows two teenage males, outcasts at their school who are taunted by Jocks and rejected by most of the peers. They start off with the idea of a school shooting, trying to keep it a secret but also giving out hints to their parents and the few friends/other family they have which makes it a little creepy. It's also creepy in the way the characters are pretty much happy with what they're planning, they're happy about the 'revenge' aspect they're hoping to indulge in on 'Zero Day'. Slowly, during the movie, you see their disintegration and how..together, especially..they seem to live in their own world. Together, they are the Army of Two.

The whole movie and idea is based, if not entirely at least a little bit, on the Columbine Massacre in Colorado of April 1999. The movie is also filmed like The Blair Witch Project, but isn't copying it in any way. I think if The Blair Witch Project was never made, Zero Day would still film it in this way..because it shows the video diaries of the two central characters in this movie. Counting down the days to the eventual 'Zero Day'.

The actors in this movie are not professional actors, which makes it even more amazing considering the acting is incredible i think. It makes it that much more real to use actual teenagers.  If you have seen Elephant, and enjoyed it, definitely check this awesome movie out. Personally, i think it is better in alot of ways than Elephant..but i also enjoyed Elephant very much. Zero Day is an extremely interesting experience for open-minded people who want to indulge in a serious film with a serious message. This is reality.",1134259200,7,2293,4.6265356265356266
2229470,4,B0007PAMII,"Excellent Independent Film about 2 boys ( Andre and Cal ) who over the course of a year are planning an assault on their school which they will call ( Zero Day). Zero day is the code word for the day on which the shooting will take place. Over the course of this year we are shown the whole plan and get to see into the minds of the killers.  These use video cameras to record their mission. Every aspect is planned to perfection. We get to see many sides of their personalities/ how normal or ordinary they are at one point, yet we cant understand why they commited these crimes. The one mentions some things that happened to him in school during the film but you are left wondering. Why? They claim there is no reason. Could be for notoriety or just hate for society in general.  The film looks like it was shot with a regular home video camcorder. It adds a hardcore realness to the film. You can easily mistake this for being real. It is, in a sense real. Its extremely well acted and compelling. Chilling and Artistic film. I try to find unique films on Amazon that I haven't seen before and once in a great while I'll find one. It's rare to find a gem like this- Everyone should see this. One of the best films Ive seen this year, Highly Recomended. 4.5 Stars....Let the countdown begin.",1123113600,7,1293,4.316872427983539
2229471,5,B0007PAMII,"It took a while for this movie to come out on DVD, and I hope it now receives the wider audience it deserves, since it was never in wide release. The entire movie is filmed as if it were assembled from footage shot on camcorders mostly by the two protagonists, with a chilling shift at the end to another verite camera source. This gives it an immediacy and feeling of reality that other films on the same topic lack. This film really got under my skin.",1118016000,8,453,4.27906976744186
2229472,5,B0007PAMII,"I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this, but by the end of the film I was stunned by how well it had been assembled and presented. The distinct lack of narration and guidance allow Andre and Calvin to lead the viewer through the communally warped and surreal psyche of a pair of ruthless and motivated teenage killers. Not since the original Blair Witch Project have I seen a film that has been successful in maintaining the illusion of being amateur film re-assembled by professionals, and this one being based on a tragic string of events that we're all aware of is particularly haunting and surreal. The two young actors do an exceptional job and are very believable. Scenes are wonderfully assembled in mounting tension and the film reaches a tremendous crescendo through which I could hardly blink. Highly recommended.",1116201600,20,833,4.914893617021277
2229473,5,B0007PAMII,"Zero Day is a fantastic movie in truly grasping the problems of adolescence and school violence-- the sense of being forced into a system that lacks a sense of purpose, logic or justice, and the urge to do something to change or mute that system. This sense is then overlapped with the adolescent/American sense of destruction, and we watch the characters engage in a series of events that get progressively more charged, but which don't seem too outlandish when viewed in the closed scope of relation from one to the next. We then find ourselves at an apex which is tragic and terrifying.

In the end, Ben Coccio does a fantastic job of dissecting the case of teenage violence and school shootings without presenting a washed-out morality tale or glorifying the students, instead lingering on how easily our society sets the constructs that can slip into these warped acts.

Once again Ben and the guys at Professor Bright Films have produced a work that presents important questions and the perspective to generate discussion and dialogue. The reaction to this movie has been charged, and rightly so. See this one.",1114300800,6,1116,4.8994708994708995
2229474,5,B0007PAMII,"I saw this movie when it came out in theaters and I have to say that it was the best movie concerning this subject that I have seen(it's definitely far better that ""Home Room"") and that the acting in this movie is so convincing that one would think that it was real and I especially liked the fact that the movie treated the two main characters as human beings as opposed to just hateful killing machines.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who in intrested in this genre and I think that this movie should be REQUIRED viewing to anyone who wonders why school shootings occur ESPECIALLY the faculity at Columbine High School.",1112745600,17,641,4.573913043478261
2229475,5,B0007PAMII,"Zero day got the least attention of the Columbine style movies all

released around the same time, but as a reviting entertainment, this is a better film. Questions are not answered, but the

2229516,5,B0007PAMII,"I really enjoy this first-hand single-camera style of film. Usually the acting is unatural and distracting from the storyline. This is not the case with Zero Day. It's a brilliant take on a familiar premise, well shot and crafted, the character development and acting are natural and submersive, the direction is fantastic, and the story is relatable and realistically suspenseful. This film is obviously not for everyone, but if you enjoy similar storylines and this self shot ""real life"" style this one is worth the time.",1459123200,,523,5.093023255813954

2229520,4,B0007PAMII,"Generally speaking, I hate films that are shot on camcorder, but they do make things more realistic. This was a necessity for the film, Zero Day, which gives an in depth look at the psyche of two school shooters. The story isn't unexpected or anything you haven't seen before, but what makes this film unique is how the producers went about casting this film. The entire cast is made up of ordinary kids, with no previous acting experience, to that end, the entire immediate family of the shooters are also used in the film. Given that these kids weren't actors at the time, a lot of scenes also remain unscripted. The kids were told to just talk about things that make being a teenager tough, expressing dark, innermost feelings of rage and hatred of society. It was then that the writers wrote dialogue that corresponded with what these kids were saying. The result of this is one of the most realistic films I've ever seen. It was like actually being able to watch the video diaries of the Columbine shooters, expressing their feelings, and explaining their actions, prior to that tragic day. Both boys featured in the film are terrific and the way the Director just let the story flow, based on what these two kids had to say, was absolutely ingenious. I think this film was an amazing insight into the minds of troubled teenagers and I think it's a must see for anyone in the field of education.",1453507200,,1400,4.604

2229537,5,B0007PAMII,"Chilling.  And until the very end, I thought it was real.  I don't know if teens should watch this or not.  These two high schoolers plan for 'Zero Day', the day when they plan to do a school shooting, then suicide.  The movie is them doing the planning.  It's very realistic.  Very well done, and kept me on the edge of my seat.  As in real incidents of school shootings, lives are wasted for no coherent reason.",1432512000,,413,4.285714285714286

2229539,5,B0007PAMII,"Lately, I have been going back and watching the movies available in the school shooter genre, from Zero Day, Klass, Elephant, State's Evidence, Bang, Bang, and more. Some of definitely better than others and some, like this, are chilling because they have elements that mimic real-life events.  In the videos in Zero Day, for example, there are home movies that mimic a lot of what the Columbine shooters videotaped in what has now been referred to as The Basement Tapes, from one of the main characters crying to making explosives and more. This is mixed in with other videos in the same way, too, showing mundane family get-together and conversations with parents. To me, that illustrates something chilling because on one hand you have likable kids blending in and making friends while going through their daily lives. On the other hand, they are planning something terrible. It also adds an element of tragedy to the events because you are always left wondering the classic question, why? Something that Zero Day does that other movies do not is makes you actually like the people involved, so you feel invested in the individuals doing the crime. That makes the deeds seem a little more confusing in a way because it humanizes them, which is something you also do not have in a lot of this type film.

As far as rating this goes, I rated it as the type of film it is and scored it against other films of that type. That seems only fair because people know about this classification of film and whether they enjoy those are not, so it rates something like an Elephant directly against it.",1430870400,,1592,4.702508960573477
2229540,5,B0007PAMII,"I really love this movie...I know it's based on Columbine, but more people need to see this movie. These kids weren't bullied when Eric and Dylan were. But this shows that kids can get guns from any family member if they aren't careful",1428624000,,235,4.488372093023256

2229543,1,B0007PAMII,"Definitely a must-see, along with ""Elephant"", for anyone interested in the dynamics of school shootings and active shooter events.

The only thing I had an issue with is - as a professional who deals with these incidents - that it does intentionally provide some viable ""lessons learned"" from previous real-world incidents that an unstable person considering such an act (however unlikely) could actually use to avoid detection prior to carrying out the act itself. For that reason I can't, in good conscience, give this more than one star.

This is the only review in nearly 675 Amazon reviews I've written in which I had a moral or ethical objection to the product itself that I felt compelled to reflect in my rating.",1424044800,,720,4.89344262295082

2229562,5,B0007PAMII,"I thought that Zero Day was very well done. I have seen many other movies with this same topic, but aside from April Showers, I thought this was the best. Columbine in particular is something that has always interested me. I try to imagine what would force someone to go that far. I have learned that it was cause of a psychopath and a depressive. Put a couple teens with these issues in an environment where they feel inferior and bad things are likely to happen. I believe that Zero Day does a good job at helping me understand their thinking and how they planned their massacre. For anyone who has an interest in this unfortunate topic i recommend this movie.",1371772800,,662,4.479338842975206
2229563,4,B0007PAMII,"There is one point of view one could consider that this movie could be a instructional video for any number of disturbed teenagers who could be on the brink of deciding to commit such horrible atrocities because within these two young men who commit these acts of murder there is a sort of sick agenda that seems to nearly have a certain bizzare justification for the killings they commit. it's like the characters are saying ""There's really nothing wrong with us at all. We weren't effected by movies, TV, video games, books or what ever. it just had to be done."" The film paints a picture of these animals as though they are some sort of saviors sending a message that almost makes what they do seem acceptable. This kind of film could influence other young people who are not mentally sound to do the same thing. And on that level this film should be condemmed. Also because the film explains realistically how to make pipe bombs, how to utilize guns, and so fourth I think it's dangerous film in the hands of the mentally weak. This film should freighten people and be a genuine wakeup call to a very real and pressing danger that is all too true in todays worlkd. On the other hand the film does send an obvious message at the end that they are despised by their peers for what they did. And one only needs to look at this story objectively to understand that the two boys who were the central characters were the lowest and sickest form of life on earth. And I think the film does get that message across if your willing to note that point. Over all a very convincing film that should be taken as a serious warning. Don't ever end up being so messed up in your head to ever make the same tragic mistake these two boys made.",1367625600,,1729,4.389408099688474
2229564,5,B0007PAMII,"ZERO DAY takes us through the entire ""mission"" of school-shooters, Cal and Andre, as they unveil their plan, step-by-step. This is shot video diary-style, allowing us to see their target-practice, bomb-making, and theft, along w/ many candid moments. Cal and Andre have had enough. There's no turning back. They have decided to carry out their plan no matter what. They take full responsibility / blame, making sure to point out that movies, video games, parents, etc., had nothing to do w/ their decision. Chilling in its realism, ZD offers a look inside the heads of these enigmatic men. Outwardly, they're each quite personable, w/ obvious intelligence and a sense of humour. Inside of them is a different story, and that's what the final 15 minutes is about. Highly recommended...",1358726400,2,784,5.0852713178294575
2229565,4,B0007PAMII,Zero Day is by far the best movie about the Columbine Massacre I've ever seen. It feels more authentic since the whole movie is film by handheld cameras. It really makes you feel like you were there with them and you know all of their secrets. Its a must see if you're interested in that type of thing.,1347148800,,302,4.224137931034483
2229591,5,B0007PAMII,"""Zero Day"" is one of the most unusual and fascinating movies I have ever seen, a perfect example of effective use of limited resources. It also has an interesting history. Director Ben Coccio first thought of and began writing the film in the wake of Columbine in 1999, completed it in 2001, but didn't release it until 2003 because of the September 11 attacks. In the intervening two years he had plenty of time to edit, something Coccio did for about six months. The end result was another great film that upon release received virtually no attention but is well-appreciated by the few people who have seen it. ""Zero Day"" is a grand total of 92 minutes long, and had my attention for all 92 of them.

The premise of ""Zero Day"" is simple: two American high schoolers somewhat like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, planning a school shooting very much like Columbine. And like Harris and Klebold, our two- protagonists?- document their plans and preparation through a handheld video camera. We see the entire movie through that camera, save for the opening and closing credits and the scene, filmed by school security cameras, where the boys' planning comes to fruition. The filming of ""Zero Day"" is highly unique in that not one professional camera was used, and I believe that definitely adds a feeling of realism to it. Few would-be school shooters have the kind of cameras Hollywood does.

""Zero Day"" has few surprises as far as the plot goes. Two disgruntled teenagers are documenting their plan to attack their high school, ending their own lives being part of the plan. What do you think happens? They decide to call it off? I won't spoil anything for you, but big plot twists are not why somebody goes to see ""Zero Day"". But that's not to say the plot isn't interesting. It's not so much learning where it ends- the destination is more or less understood- but the journey that takes us there. Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel take us along as they prepare for the big day, offering advice and expressing opinions and beliefs along the way.
I was disappointed to find the film starts after they've already made the decision- the conversation(s), the evolving and shaping of Andre and Cal's views and goals, that led up to their making the solemn pact of ""Zero Day"" would have been interesting to see. Or, at least to have discussed in detail. But while it did retain my interest consistently from beginning to end, ""Zero Day"" rather let me down as far as the biggest question regarding school shooters goes- why they did it. It seems to shy away from that. Yes, it can be taken for granted that Andre and Cal already know. But what about us? We're watching the movie, after all. Coccio should have taken that part of the movie head-on- it's already controversial, so make the most of it.

There is no soundtrack to speak of in ""Zero Day"". It has exactly two songs- Sonic Youth's ""Eliminator Jr."" and Benji Cossa's ""Volcano"". The latter is the movie's theme song if it has one- played during the closing credits, it is so fitting that Cossa could have written the song expressly for ""Zero Day"". Another song I would suggest listening to is The Beach boys' ""I Just Wasn't Made for these Times"", which Ben Coccio had wanted to use also, but for unknown reasons wasn't able to. That song, just like ""Volcano"", fits ""Zero Day"" like a glove. Ben Coccio used very few songs in his movie, but certainly knew how to pick them.

Most of ""Zero Day"" is one member of the self-proclaimed ""Army of Two"" speaking to the other. There are some occasions where the camera is used for something totally irrelevant, such as Cal going to the dentist and Andre being visited at his job at a pizza place by his father. Some have said that Andre and Cal only interact meaningfully with each other, and that their plan overshadows everything else they do. Well, wouldn't that make sense? Why would their jobs, social lives, or future careers matter at all, when they're in the final stages of a plan that makes all those things irrelevant? Maybe Zero Day weighs on their minds, detaches Andre and Cal from all other aspects of their lives. That is a likely phenomenon, something Coccio captures very well. Not many high schoolers plan on killing themselves and as many classmates as possible before graduation, so the mindset and feelings that come with that are probably difficult for most to imagine.

All that said, ""Zero Day"" works a lot more than it doesn't. It has made it to the point of being readily available on DVD despite virtually no theatrical release- I certainly never heard of one- and a two year delay in getting it released in the first place. Coccio dared to make a kind of movie very few people ever have- or will, deciding to deal with a much more realistic, much more relevant kind of evil than the one we are used to seeing. ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" both show evil on a titanic scale ultimately getting the epic butt-kicking it deserves. ""Zero Day"" offers no such resolution, because that just isn't possible. Backyard evil isn't as popular in theaters for two reasons- it can't be resolved the same way as standard movie evil, and I very much doubt the public likes having to deal with it. And while that may be understandable, that isn't acceptable.

""Zero Day"" is the kind of movie we need to have more of, one that deals with issues very relevant to real life. While it's nice to get lost in Fantasyland once in a while, we can't let ourselves stay there. It matters a lot more that we think about what ""Zero Day"" leaves us with than whether or not it's right to invade planets full of blue people. Yes, ""Avatar"", I'm talking about you.",1303430400,6,5653,4.608738828202582
2229592,4,B0007PAMII,"Having spent the better part of the last year researching and studying the tragedy at Columbine, I naturally turned to this movie as a part of that research and I came away from this a little torn...certain aspects of this film were chillingly realistic and added depth to my understanding while others were clearly uninformed and rushed. First, the viewer should know that this movie is not a documentation of the Columbine shooting...it does however use that crime as it's basis. Second, the viewer should also realize that even though it's based on Columbine, it's premise is what is thought to be in the Columbine ""Basement Tapes"" and relies on written opinions of those tapes and speculation. These are videos recorded by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold documenting the planning of the crime and are currently in lock up with the Jefferson County Sheriff's office and have been seen by only a handful of people.

We're introduced immediately to the protagonists and get a clear picture of what they're planning. The filming is entirely on hand held video (thus theoretically matching the Basement Tapes) which certainly adds realism to the film. They say that they are angry and plan to attack the school, but no evidence of bullying, mental health problems or egomaniacal behavior is presented and this I feel is the major drawback in this film. Granted, most of the major clues missed at Columbine were the result of Harris's and Klebold's apparent normal behavior but their anger ensued over time...time that obviously isn't available to the film's makers. The directors needed to establish a base anger in my opinion and then this film would have seemed a bit more believable.

Again, clearly using the evidence of the Columbine shooting, we follow Andre and Cal's progress in development of the plan...numerous similarities are noted to the actual crime. On the day of the ""big ass mission"" we see a short scene explaining their actions and apologizing for the coming events. The actual attack is covered by school video surveillance tape and has been confused with actual Columbine footage on many video websites. This is the highlight of the film as it presents a somber picture of what it may have been like inside Columbine...the viewer gets a surreal experience and should be discreet regarding watching this with children. The film closes with anger at a makeshift memorial set up for the victims, similar to the memorial erected at Clement park's Rebel Hill following Columbine.

This is a film not recommended for general view, but an essential one for understanding and experiencing what school shootings are like.",1263513600,,2631,5.016018306636155
2229593,4,B0007PAMII,"I saw this movie and overall, it was good. But as a person who's been studying Columbine for years, some of the things that were reenacted might not have ever happened. The part in the library, for example, with each gunman's monologue. No one knows who said what, and who said what to whom. Parts of the film were not entirely factual. There were survivors who each had different versions of what happened. Many kids who were in the library didn't remember a lot of what happened because they were terrified at the time, and most people who face events as traumatic as the shootings have trouble remembering details. It was good, and the events were all true. The actual dialogue that was acted out could have been minimized, though. This was a very good film, nonetheless. One will learn a lot about Columbine while watching it, but beware of some of the things that are said during the reenactments. The journal entries that are recited, however, are word for word.

What I appreciated about the similiar themed ""Elephant"" was the amount of information revealed about the characters through visuals alone.  ""Zero Day"" may offer more gritty, awkward teenage realism, but ""Elephant"" was able to somewhat relay the disturbed driving spirit behind the acts of violence, something even a flawed film like ""Life Before Her Eyes"" managed to do.",1222214400,,528,5.2
2229595,3,B0007PAMII,"In this harsh reality of our existence, and this foul year of our Father 2008, we find the increasing hysteria around violence, school shootings, and teenagers carrying guns, not so much in the ghetto's and big cities of America, but in suburbia. The aftermath of events like that of Columbine and Virginia Tech echo only true emotions to the reality that we revolve ourselves around in and in that we find, 'Zero Day'

While the two main characters, Andre Kriegman and Calvin Gabriel, fitting like a glove to perhaps the days and months that prepared the real life Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who themselves made home videos, are ever present in the film. The pure tenacity, and testicular fortitude the two have is beyond maniacal. The opening segment alone, of the two as youth's, with the stellar opening song, is enough to set you up for a roller coaster of a trip.

Zero Day delivers in a way you would only expect it to. There is no need to expect a dynamite show of method acting and the like. We, as in other films of it's genre, see the life and times of two troubled teens, building an arsenal of weapons and coming from left field without a trace of worry from friend or family alike. However we are lead to believe, by the perps themselves, that they are not the end product of Grand Theft Auto Marathon's until the early next morning, or by-products of shows like 24 or the like. They take full responsibilty for their actions and make it clear in their videos, that no one is to blame, and no one could have prevented this. I think that is a very important mechanism in the film. As much as we want to protect our children, in the end, they will do what they want to do, right even under our nose.

In the hey-dey of horrid first person, cam-shooting genres like 'Blair ' and the horrible-as-much-as-you-want-to-candycoat-it 'Cloverfield', the film is not shifty, jaded or nauseous in anyway. In fact the camcorder shooting is quite appealing and very personal, as it should be. If you really let yourself immerse into the movie, you feel as if you were with the two boys throughout the whole planning of the massacre. You have front row seats into their zero day plan, their march towards victory, their own personal vendetta towards the how the other half walks. Their own chiming in on the world to let everyone know, they too will be remembered.

People might come here, and say the movie brings a strong message to all, that is should be a guide or an aid to what schools should be prepared for. Well in all reality, it should make the bullies, the jocks, 'Johnny Football Hero' who gets away with everything and anything because he is the town's pride and joy, and that stuffing Mike the Chess Player in the toilet after gym can have dire consequences. Not to say what happens in this movie or at Columbine was warranted, but you never hear about the torment these kind of kids go through, getting called names that could demoralize a youth for life.

I won't give anything away, but if you want something better than the Van Sant pederastic feel to a film like the incessantly juvenile 'Elephant', and something less surreal then 'Bang, Bang, Your Dead,' perhaps Zero Day is a shining example that you don't have to go to NYU or USC film school to get into the hearts and minds of movie lovers who really appreciate art in the form of pure, raw, commando-style filmmaking. Kudos!

2229596,3,B0007PAMII,"Excellent video a training to prevent or make others aware of this
As a form of entertainment, it is not designed for that, as it was set up in a diary format reliving the days prior to the shooting through the eyes of Harris and Klebold.

The movie is based of the actions of Harris and Klebold who were the gunmen in the Columbine Highschool shooting.  The movie is an actual based presentation of the videos that were made by the suspects prior to that day.  It does explain the amount of thought and action they put into this tragic event.  They did there research! Makes you wonder how far they could have gone, and how much they could have accomplished had they put this effort towards something else.
This video deffinately teaches you allot.
It also let people know that it does not mean that the families of the suspects caused it or that it was a random event.",1197849600,,870,4.41875

This is a very subtle piece of art: you will easily relate to this movie's main two characters, think you're in their minds and can predict their behavior, until, well, until... Zero Day comes, and you'll be shocked beyond belief, dwelling on the fact that Andre or Cal could have been your brother, your cousin, your childhood friend; and yes, still, in the end, they actually do it... This is a movie for all the World to see. You don't need to have lived in the U.S. to feel connected; believe a french man who saw in Zero Day an authentic masterpiece.

2229600,5,B0007PAMII,"Zero Day is yet another of the many films trying to make sense of the much publicized school shootings that seem to be increasing in frequency across the nation. What makes this movie different from many others lies in two different areas.

One, There doesn't appear to be a single major issue that stands out as the precursor to such a horriffic and perfectly planned out event. Yes, we are given snippets here and there through the characters that their general hatred toward their classmates was indeed fueled by the usual bullying behaviors. Sure they go to school with kids in a better economic circumstance and probably rub it in their faces every chance they get, but these are only glimpses and suppositions. Overall, we are left to really wonder about whether these or the other factors of being a teen were what ultimately led these teens to their carefully laid plans.

Two, The film is as raw and believable as a camcorder film of your own family. Gus Van Sant may have provided some interesting curveballs in Elephant by looking through the students' eyes as they moved through their schoolday, but Zero Day's take on the methodical countdown to disaster is nothing short of amazing. These teens don't seem to be acting at all. They are just teens being themselves. There's no hollywoodized impression of what it's like to be a teen, this is just raw, seemingly unscripted improvisation as the pair makes their plans of destruction.

It all fuses together in a chaotic, realistic film that will leave you searching within yourself for ways to prevent further real life examples of this type of tragic occurrence. Never before have I been so deeply affected by a film's finale. It's a gut wrenchingly real scene that still makes tears well up in my eyes as I am writing this. As if the fruition of the pair's plans aren't bad enough, the final short scene before the credits is another that will leave you shaking your head. Zero day is beyond any star rating. This is not a movie, it's life.

Watch Zero Day, and get involved with EVERY aspect of your child's life. Be there for them every step of the way. Find out if they are experiencing anything that is too much for them to handle. We all must do our part to make certain that our children not only have a loving environment at home, but a proper school experience as well. If the school officials are blind to what's going on in their schools, make them see. The difference between acting and standing on the sidelines and just hoping everything is ok could be a lot more deadly than you think.",1138406400,6,2563,4.626373626373627
