We have actually had to go under general anesthesia to get x-rays, cleanings and filling done twice on him. The school nurse at his school offered to loan us this dvd to see if it would help him. Oh my goodness it worked so great with him. He loved the fact the the video includes the viewers and includes them in the dental visit. And with everything is shown in the way that the children seen it. The video was a Hugh success! The dentist was beyond herself with how fantastic my son did during the office visit!!!",1494633600,,614,4.256410256410256

8009243,5,B0001ACHBE,"I have a 5-year-old autistic boy and I was so anxious about giving him a dental checkup.  He could not open his mouth wide even when brushing his teeth.  How could he open the mouth for a stranger!

But this video is MAGIC!  He watched it everyday after I borrowed it from a dental office.  Of course he finally had a ""fairly smooth"" dental visit, which is far better than my expectation.  Also he still sings and talks about this video every single day and I need to buy one copy for the future dental visits!",1141948800,4,510,4.260416666666667
8009244,5,B0001ACHBE,"FROM START TO FINISH MY CHILDREN WERE LOCKED INTO THIS DVD.  MY SON HAD HIS FIRST DENTIST TRIP AND HE WOULD NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH AND I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD AROUND THE HOUSE JUST FOR HIM TO OPEN HIS MOUTH AND NOTHING WORKED, SO I SEARCH AND FOUND THIS DVD. PINATTA IS REALLY UP TO DATE AND HER BAND IS ""SO COOL"" AS MY 3 YR OLD PUT IT, THE TECHNIQUES PINATTA USE REALLY WORK.  HE IS NOW OPENING UP HIS MOUTH AFTER WE SEEN THE DVD A COUPLE OF TIMES, HE HAS TO GO BACK TO THE DENTIST THE END OF THE MONTH I'M SURE HE WILL LOOSEN UP A BIT.  GREAT VIDEO, GREAT CONCEPT, GREAT MUSIC.  PINATTA'S VIEW IS A MUST HAVE IF YOUR CHILD HAS SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE DENTIST.  I LOVE IT..",1125446400,5,677,3.9124087591240877
