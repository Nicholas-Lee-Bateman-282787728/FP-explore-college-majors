But here's a question for anyone and everyone: Season 2 Episode 7 ends with an utterly beautiful ballad - I don't know the song, I don't know who sings it, but the lyrics end with ""I found everything when I found you.""

6880767,2,B00QTKCPOE,"I thought the first season was rather good.  The second season went downhill rapidly with one stupid surprise after another.  I think I managed to watch 3 or 4 episodes of Season 2.  I stopped when I realized that the writers were just throwing in conflict for the sake of conflict.  I don't think I will purchase the rest of the seasons as things will likely be boringly predictable.  Long-kept secrets will be revealed; horrible things will happen......yawn.,",1497744000,,461,4.858974358974359

6880773,3,B00QTKCPOE,"There was a big missed opportunity in this nice Australian soap-Opera/drama; The main character Sarah converted to Judaism and survived the holocaust, then returned to Australia. There was an opportunity to teach the AU public something about Judaism, but the only thing we learn is that the Nazis done them wrong and that AU anti-Semites think Hitler should have 'finished the job'. There is never any explanation to why upper class Australians hated the Jews and we learn nothing about Jewish religion or culture. For instance; when anyone speaks French, there are subtitles, but when anyone prays in Hebrew, there are no subtitles. Holy days like Sabbath, Yom Kippur and Hanukkah are mentioned, but no explanation to what they signify. There was an attempt to explain Yom Kippur, but it was really insufficient. Other than this big flaw, the show is enjoyable.",1494547200,2,863,5.084507042253521

6880793,5,B00QTKCPOE,"I'm weak and need the succor afforded by  good, teary soap opera sometimes. This is definitely a ""hidden pleasure"" since the quality of the story is scarcely above ""Days of Our Lives (Now - With Sheep!)""  The characters however are empathetic and believable (in that weird soap-operatic sense) and the cinematography, mise-en-scne, and historicity seem quite perfect, It somehow gives me the same comfort as Downton Abbey. Here we see the agents of the dawning modern age (in this case the 1950's, in Australia) tunneling under the ramparts of the upper-crust. The story? --TOTALLY predictable! Our plucky heroine- the blonde Jewish nun? --Totally rocks it every show. Everyone is everyone else's bastard child? --You bet!  Everyone had deep repressed sex/medical/war secrets? --Natch!

6880796,5,B00QTKCPOE,"I love this series and am happy there is another season to come.  Some reviewers compare it to Downton Abbey but I won't do that. I would only compare A place to Call Home to Downton Abbey in that they both are very well done period dramas. A place to call home takes place over several years in the early 1950's just after WWII ends in a remote area of Australia called Inverness. This is definitely a class oriented melodrama and it does the 50's  very well. I'd liken it more to Peyton Place than anything else. The women are dressed beautifully, the location (Australia's Camelot, Google it) and the men are all well dressed. The cast are all uniformly excellent as well.  Watch it. You won't regret it.",1485475200,6,707,4.465116279069767

6880847,5,B00QTKCPOE,"Admittedly, this isn't the kind of show that I like. With that said, my wife thinks it's wonderful, and it fills the void she had when Downton Abbey came to an end. As a matter of fact, in her opinion, it's as good as that show.

According to her, this series is more like a soap opera than anything else. With that said, it's a great soap opera and the issues that are addressed in the series are relevant and powerful.

This is a period drama, taking place in Australia during the early to mid 1950's. It addresses a wide range of issues, ranging from lingering post-war anti-semitism, to many of the same social issues that are relevant today.

The acting is first rate, and the series is well written. My wife has thoroughly enjoyed watching every available episode of this show, and is always waiting in anticipation for the availability of the next season. She finds herself heavily immersed into the characters, and thinks that the moral and social issues that this show evolves around, are handled in an exceptionally stimulating way.",1481414400,8,1042,4.683060109289618

I'm glad they did though, because this show is a winner for sure! If you like period dramas, definitely watch this!

The only reason I'm knocking off one star is because the version of the Season 2 finale is a version that was shot as a series finale, when the show had been cancelled by its original station - there is a cliffhanger version which sets up the entire story line for season 3 which is the one they should include.

6880905,5,B00QTKCPOE,"Season 2 had predictable happy endings in sight until unexpected twists drastically shook-up the narrative. If life wasn't already complicated enough for the Blighs and Sarah Adams each will have to deal with new secrets and their share of just plain bad luck. Certainty is a luxury few have and the season ends with significant doubts for some. Wanting to know how it will play out for all concerned makes Season 3 essential viewing.

6880909,1,B00QTKCPOE,"I keep thinking that this is Australia's answer to Downton Abbey but, unfortunately, it is more of a Down Under version of a politically correct Dallas ---- a terrible, never ending saga of self inflicted pain and sorrow, soap opera.
I do not blame the actors.
The poor dears; it isn't  fault their that they have to work with an idiotic script and plot.
There is never a  moment's relief from the torment these accursed people are experiencing in their pathetic lives.
This family goes from one god awful, self inflicted, traumatic experience to  another.
The only family member who seems to have any awareness of what's going on is the evil matriarch who is behind it all----the rest of the family just wander in and out of scenes wondering what the hell has hit them. Or naively ignorant of what is about to sneak up from behind and deal them yet another body blow.
I got stuck watching this when some out of town company got hooked and I was laid up with a bad knee and couldn't run away.",1464912000,3,992,4.469613259668508

6880943,5,B00QTKCPOE,"This is one of the best series that I have had the pleasure to view in a long time. Everything... the production values are top notch, the actors are consummate professionals, the fifties popular songs and the fast evolution of music, culture, and fashion at that time. The writing, all of the the interwoven tales deftly created with the the genius of a modern Shakespeare fitted to evolve around a 1950's old money Australian family. It has been a long time since any series has both bothered me and delighted me so much...I actually crave it. The power dynamics as written buy the writers, acted by the actors, and produced by the technicians are all in perfect balance. It is hard for me to believe that this is broadcast network television. Kudos to you Aussies. American network television has been really lousy for some time now.

So the second season I couldn't WAIT for the t.v. station to broadcast (they said they might not do so anyway). Bought this and dived in to find out what happened to my characters (love the location shots, wow!).

THIS season, though, is HEAVIER than the first one, addressing challenges due to the historical era...homosexuality/world war II/ and post-war issues, both male female...but the characters are still interesting, and I do care about them. That level of care doesn't usually happen in any but the best written scripts. So, 4 and maybe even 4.5, but due to the heavy subject matter, not quite as enjoyable as Season One, that had it's own issues...",1448409600,3,818,4.801418439716312

6881024,5,B00QTKCPOE,"A Place to Call Home returns for a second season with a very jarring opening set in contemporary times.  Thankfully this teaser soon reverts back to the time and place we've grown to love from Season 1--Australia, 1950s.

Marta Dusseldorp's Sarah Adams faces more adversity and surprise in Season 2 as do most of the other characters.  It's all glorious.  More huffing and puffing in the bedroom and sundry other locales.  Frankly, the actors look better with their clothes on, the fifties' styles being so much fun.

The attention to period detail is one of the show's strengths and apparently there is more to come with Season 3.  This will be an interesting problem after the perfect, appropriate use of ""The End"" title card at the end of the second season.

What could Sarah possibly face next?  I can hardly wait.  Just keep it in the fifties, please.",1443139200,,856,4.722972972972973

6881131,4,B00QTKCPOE,"I am usually not a fan of soap operas with its obligitory matriarchal evil one. Each week she creates one problem and its resolved the following week followed by a new spiteful act. This series isn't much different from other soaps EXCEPT I liked the characters very much. The formula is the usual. However, there are some high quality performances. The actors for the most part are regional Australian and NZ t.v.and stage actors (a couple have some main stream film credits).There has been ,for quite awhile now, some very fine actors and productions from down under. This series fits the bill. I purchased season 1 on a whim based on its popularity and an interesting plot line of a fifties period piece. I was surprised ,pleasantly I might add, that the characters had great depth .The central character played by Marta D. is given an unusual history . Its an intriguing role of an extremely strong woman. I have enjoyed watching  her scenes . She's a very fine actor. There are other fine performances which helps keep the series rolling along.
An interesting bit of trivia is that season two has 2 sets of spouses playing opposite each other. I believe that has added more chemistry to the relationships that are redeveloping from their characters past lives.
In terms of this show being a period piece. True ,there are some older autos ,the locomotive is close to the period (pre ww2), and the clothes seem to fit. But the only need for this series to exist in the early fifties is  our main characters history. Its been a big part of the unraveling plot. Otherwise only the train has been interesting  as a time reminder.
Season three appears to be happening and as of end of season 2 we still have big time cliff hangers An unsolved murder, a player with a major revenge factor, a remorseful parent, a love triangle,some parentage issues ,will they stay together ,etc. etc. See its a soap opera. But I have enjoyed it J.R. .",1436140800,5,1933,4.646198830409356

6881136,5,B00QTKCPOE,"A PLACE TO CALL HOME, a hit Australian television series, is a binge-worthy period drama that shows us the ties that hold families together and the things that can tear them apart.  As the  hit drama returns for a second season great changes await surrounded-by-mystery, indomitable nurse Sarah Adams (played by that blond beauty of JACK IRISH, Marta Dusseldorp) and the powerful and wealthy Bligh family. Sarah and George Bligh (Brett Climo) must contend with the schemes of his mother Elizabeth (Noni Hazlehurst) to part them; George's daughter, Anna (Abby Earl), is determined to marry the unsuitable Gino (Aldo Mignone), while son James (David Berry) and his newly-wed newly-pregnant English wife, Olivia (Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood), find their marriage troubled.

The lush production uses its setting in post-World War II, 1950 Inverness, Australia, to  tackle eternal issues of anti-Semitism, social class and sexuality with insight.  I received this as a review copy. The boxed set consists of ten episodes on three discs, running approximately 430 minutes.  It has subtitles, thank goodness, not everyone can follow the Australian accent.  It features bonuses such as behind the scenes interviews  70 minutes; From Young to Old -- 2 minutes and clips about its characters  20 minutes.  And beware: it does contain scenes of violence and sexuality.
The scenery is gorgeous in this high-quality production that was described as a sexy cross between DYNASTY and DOWNTON ABBEY with a twist of MAD MEN by Parade.  Mind you, it  is femme-oriented soap opera, without a doubt, taking place in the womans world of houses, families, children.  And I, for one, who was not familiar with the entertainment, could not follow the first episode, set in the present day, with Sarah at age 99, a flashback and frame.  I had to go back and watch the first series streaming. It introduces us to Sarah, who has endured a harsh World War II in France, and, after twenty years in Europe, has returned to her native Australia because her mother is ill.

This second series does illuminate most of the mysteries the first series left us, while leaving us with another big one.  Acting is uniformly top rank.  Supporting actors include, as locals, Craig Hall as Dr. Jack Duncan, Deborah Kennedy as Doris Collins, Frankie J. Holden as Roy Briggs.  Also Sara Wiseman as Carolyn Bligh, aunt to the Bligh children and Jenni Baird, as Regina Standish, the childrens other aunt, sister to their late mother.  The two aunts have been rather peculiarly cast, as the two actors strongly resemble each other: tall dark-haired buxom women with strong, handsome facial features: it might take viewers new to the series a while to sort them.  But you can always recognize Auntie Regina by her blue eye shadow.
The episodes:
1. No Secrets, Ever.  Sarah and Anna begin their similar trial periods in their new homes.  Jack is angry with Carolyn for keeping their child secret.  Olivia struggles to deal with James harsh hospital treatment.
2. I Believe.  Carolyn tells Jack the identity of their daughter.  James tries to escape hospital.  Elizabeth and Regina scheme against Sarah.
3. A Kiss to Build a Dream On. On the eve of their engagement party, Sarah wonders whether to tell George the terrible secret from her World War II years. James treatments grow more brutal; George makes a decision about Anna.
4. What Your Heart Says. George, Sarah and Olivia rush to the clinic to see James true condition; the family copes with his recovery.  Sarah gets an inkling of what Elizabeth is planning; she feels  forced to tell George her disturbing past.
5. The Ghosts of Christmas Past.  George struggles with Sarahs past.  The roots of Elizabeth and Jacks special relationship are revealed.
6. Auld Lang Syne.  Elizabeth plots a high society party to make Sarah reveal her inadequacies. Carolyn and Jack are getting along famously, but can he conquer his emotional issues from the War?  Olivia gets heart-breaking news that might destroy her fragile marriage.
7. No Other Love. Reginas French discovery destroys George and Sarahs brittle happiness.  Olivia is offered a difficult solution to her predicament, keeps her new secret to herself.
8. Answer Me, My Love.  Decisions with wide ramifications: Sarah goes to France to see Rene; Regina moves into a cottage near Ash Park to continue her pursuit of George.  Olivia makes a monumental decision; Anna finds out the truth about her father, Elizabeth struggles to reconcile with her son.
9. I Do, I Do.  Sarah returns to Inverness with Rene; Elizabeth worries about how this will affect George.  Olivia struggles to bond with the baby. Anna and Ginos wedding, some surprises  and love triangles --among the guests.
10. Unforgettable. George is caught up in his problems, considers leaving Ash Park.  Regina lays her last, best-planned trap for him.  Rene realizes all Sarah has given up for him. As she considers her past dealings, Elizabeth learns a bit and makes a surprise decision.

Instantly irresistible saga captivatingly filmed, deeply romantic drama of immense intelligence distinguished by a uniformly superb cast, said the Wall Street Journal, and I can hardly top all those superlatives.  I will say that I found this show riveting, binge-watch worthy indeed and increasingly powerful as it reached its conclusion. Im told that this show has survived cancellation plans and will be back for seasons three and four.  Goody goody.",1434672000,15,5457,5.057046979865772

***NEWS ON SEASONS 3 & 4 BELOW***

For those not yet familiar with this excellent Australian production, this falls a little more on the side of period melodrama but the characters are well created and acted so they are substantial. I admit, I was a little skeptical at first. For those who hate family melodramas, it still may not suit your tastes. However, most of the characters are generally good people who are trying to do the right thing in their own mind. They are not caricatures fighting over the family fortune as you might expect in a show involving an upper crust family. Their challenges are that of the older Victorian values vs. the evolving youth. It's nice to see an Australian entry into this genre that gives a slightly different take than American and British audiences might be used to. From the Victorian manor house, the 40's and 50's music, the classic cars, the elegance of society, or contrast of pastoral Australian ranch land. The uniqueness of this show is somewhat symbolized by the chauffeured Jaguar Mark V traveling on the country roads of their estate.

SEASON 2 (no spoilers):  With many of the hidden struggles out in the open from season one, now certain characters have to make hard choices and deal with consequences.  James tries to show his worried wife Olivia that he is committed to their new family.  Anna rises to the challenges presented to her and Gino while coping with the aristocratic family Swanson and their son Andrew (who is also a rival for her hand in marriage).  The black sheep of the family is Carolyn Bligh, George's sister, who lives a bohemian life in the city.  She comes back to Inverness to play a larger role in the family.  Despite her partial estrangement, it is clear she is the one people run to for understanding.  Regina, sister of George's deceased wife, reveals the deepest of evil depths she is willing to go to in order to win George away from Sarah.  It is a mirror that shines back onto matriarch Elizabeth's actions and begins to make her question her own methods of protecting the family.  The show also begins to delve into Elizabeth's young married life and explains many of her actions.  The season begins with an odd flash forward to present times as an older Sarah recounts the story.  This format was not used in season one and is a little distracting from the period feel.  I suspect it was inserted, in part, because they thought the show was canceled and they needed a way to exit.  However, that is mainly the beginning of the first episode and we stay in period the rest of the time.

THERE IS A SEASON 3... AND 4! This show was originally cancelled after season two.  However, it was since renewed for seasons 3 and 4. Season 3 is already up for pre-order DVD and available now on Amazon streaming service. The first two seasons of this series in the US are on DVD, but there are UK Blu Rays marked for regions A,B and C.  I see only DVD so far on season 3 time of writing this.

OTHER THOUGHTS: Since season two brings many issues to a head, it can seem even a touch more soapy than season 1.  However, as I said in my season 1 review, the characters are so wonderful and substantial that they escape being caricatures and make a compelling story.  I watched both seasons in a single long weekend even though I was skeptical during the first episode of season 1.  It simply won me over in a big way.",1432857600,43,3528,4.528391167192429
