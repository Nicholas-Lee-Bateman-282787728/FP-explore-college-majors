3481003,4,B001B3LILA,"Sara Armstrong (Gail O'Grady) is 38 years old and is just fine with not having a significant other. Or, rather, her significant other constitutes her 10-year-old son Jesse (Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak). They're doing okay, just them two. And if there is a man in their lives, it's Ben (Robert Mailhouse), a longtime neighbor in their New York apartment building. As much as Sara, Ben has raised Jesse. The kid is so comfortable with Ben that Ben's apartment is like a second home to him. I mean, kid doesn't ever knock before busting in.

It's been seven years since Sara's husband passed, a hero cop who died in the line of fire. She used her husband's pension to open a neighborhood community center, and that's become her passion. So you may imagine her sinking feeling when the landlord tells her of his intent to sell the building to developers. There's still six years on the lease, but he reminds her that if the tenant can't pay the $750,000 as indicated in the contract, he can then accept a better offer. This sucks, 'cause, yeah, Sara's been struggling to make payments. Things get worse when the building inspector further jeopardizes the center's staying open.

Let's pan over to Toyco International, the powerful toy company. See, sales could better be, and so the suits are fretting about this year's coming Christmas ad campaign. And then some bright bulb in the think tank comes up with the inaugural ""All I Want for Christmas"" contest, open to children five to ten years old, for them to submit a video stating what they want most in the world. 10-year-old Jesse submits his video in which he asks for a father for his mom. And when his video wins, there's Toyco launching a nationwide dating competition to find the right man for Sara. And there's the very reluctant Sara at last capitulating but only because she'd cornered Toyco into ""donating"" money to keep the community center open. Oh, dear, if only Sara knew what you and I immediately sussed out, that the right man's been there all along, helping her raise her kid. You can't at all be surprised that Ben has had these feelings for her since forever.

Greg Germann is a key executive at Tocyo International, what with being the CEO's son. He fills a role I was hoping he wouldn't because I don't really typecast him that way. His character lifted me out of the story a bit since I wasn't sold on what happens to him. Other than that quibble, I enjoyed ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS, a 2007 Christmas joint from Hallmark. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars. This may have been the first time ever that I was invested in a Gail O'Grady role. Dunno why. It's not like she's awful in other shows. But I found her incredibly sympathetic as Sara who's averse to the national spotlight but sacrifices her privacy to secure her community center's future. I also liked Robert Mailhouse's quiet approach to playing Ben. He comes off as such a normal guy, a good dude. It's a stark contrast with Greg Germann's snooty-camouflaging-as-nice interpretation of the CEO's son Roger, although, probably, Germann was only following the script's character notes.

I love it whenever a romantic movie takes place in New York. The cinematography treats us to gorgeous shots of Central Park. If you're one of them folks who, like me, melt at stories featuring unrequited love, then this movie may not be a time-waster. It's Hallmark, yeah. So there's no objectionable material. No lewd moments. No inappropriate language. But it can't hold up under the strain of close scrutiny. For one thing, I can't see a powerhouse corporation buckling under to someone's demanding that much money or she won't go on their show. Anyway, bear up under the weight of all the cheese and clichs. The movie does this thing where it pushes the wrong dude on our girl for as long as possible so as to ratchet up your and my frustration. Maybe I should be more exasperated with Sara, seeing as how she waits until it was just about too late before realizing what really matters. And maybe I should throw Ben more of the side-eye, seeing as the fool had all these years to tell her how he feels, but didn't. Ben, to quote Lotto, you gotta be in it to win it. Or don't listen to me. I've never won the lottery ever.",1488067200,,4229,4.61968085106383

To me, The Christmas Card is a breath of fresh air and the love of friends and family.  ALL of the acting is top notch, and Sargent Cody Cullen and Faith Spellman aren't bad looking, either!!! :-)  To top that off, Ed Asner gives one of his best ever performances.  It is hearwarming and very believable.  Honestly:  BUY THIS MOVIE!  IT IS AT LEAST AS GOOD OR MAYBE EVEN BETTER THAN THE OLD CHRISTMAS CLASSICS!!!

3481171,3,B001B3LILA,"In case this makes a difference for anyone else thinking of buying this two Christmas movie pack, ""The Christmas Card,"" is not in widescreen, as all of us who first saw this on TV watched it. It is the old fashioned, 4:3, which fills old TV screens, but leaves large areas of black on the right and left of modern, widescreen TVs. The other film is widescreen.

For future reference, when a film here notes it is, ""Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1,"" this is what most of us refer to 4:3. I learned this doing a search.

My rating of 3 is because only one of the Christmas films is enjoyable to watch on a moden, wide screen TV. ""The Christmas Card,"" does get broadcast periodically, even in the summer. Next time it is dhown, I am going to record it even though the quality will not be as good as a commercial DVD. This movie really is far more enjoyable viewing in widescreen. If it released in widescreen in the future, I shall buy that.",1441843200,,927,4.32183908045977

3481326,4,B001B3LILA,"This is one of those movies I try to watch every Christmas season -- I've seen it maybe a half dozen times.  I know the story very well, alright, maybe a little too well, but I like all of the things a movie gives with the story -- the acting is fine, the mood and the music, the whole package.  Is it a formula movie?  To some extent it is; most of the romantic films are but, for me, they always give enough details that are different to keep me happy.
  Yes, it's about a single Mom with a child, in this case a son who is convinced that Mom needs a husband (his dad died years ago); and it's in the pursuit of that worthwhile project that he enters her into a Christmas contest -- what he wants for Christmas is a husband for his mother.
  I don't think there's very much in the movie that hasn't shown up in some other movie, but it's put together nicely and, in the end, has created a pleasantly different story in the process.  All in all I still enjoy watching it.",1417737600,2,972,4.078947368421052

3481506,5,B001B3LILA,"I bought this two-fer mainly for 'Christmas Card' which has a good, wholesome story line and pleasant characters and sub-plots. I like military veteran stories involving complex matters of the heart.

 All I want for Christmas is a cute movie but a little cliche' (little boy submits a Christmas wish to a contest -- he wants a Dad for Christmas - a new husband for his mom -- and his wish gets picked). Mom has to go on several set up dates while falling for the guy behind the contest.",1371168000,,487,4.4

It's based on a warm town with warm people from a loving church whose congregation sends Christmas cards to those serving in the armed forces. It's the story of the journey that one of those cards from that church takes a young serviceman on and the family who takes him in while he decides where his life will take him from there.  Should he re-enlist, or should he not? The story line is so good that I watch it all year long whenever I feel like I need a smile.  Happiest ending ever!  The acting is wonderful.

She accepts the rich guy's proposal knowing she doesn't love him, but reasons that he will provide what her son with family. What she didn't say, but was evident, was that he would provide her son with wealth. She calls off the engagement when he decides to send her beloved son to boarding school. When the heroine kissed the hero, she made the most disgusting face, as if she couldn't stomach him. Finally, she accepts the hero's proposal right after she breaks it off with the rich guy. I felt sorry for the hero that he was only a consolation prize. She probably accepted his proposal because the engagement ring looked to be at least 1-2 carats!

Unfortunately, she turns out to be just that. She turns down several guys because they are obviously not right for her and her son, but the one she finally chooses is the worst of all. It was a very forced story line. The writers could have made her decision make sense, but they chose not to do that. So, she was just left looking like an idiot. The son was cute, and I enjoyed the relationship between him and the next door neighbor. But the mom and the neighbor just didn't have enough chemistry. It was pretty cheesy in the end.

You know what? I love my family SOOO much, I would do anything for them.  In fact, I worked SO HARD in life that we became wealthy and have a wonderful life...  what is EVIL about that????????  I'm so sick and tired of the anti-wealth sentiment in our country.  Whether you are rich or poor, you can have a house filled with love and laughter.  This movie made me want to retch and vomit with it's socialist propaganda...

Are we to assume that every wealthy company-owner is from inherited wealth?  or that they all went to boarding school??????  It's absurd.  Oh, don't forget, all rich, good-looking men have no soul and are cold and heartless.  :  RIDICULOUS!

3481606,1,B001B3LILA,We are pretty conservative in what we watch and I thought a Christmas movie would be safe - especially with a G rating.  But there was at least one curse word in this movie - so we didn't get to watch the rest.  Our rule is - if there is swearing - off it goes.  Just wanted to warn any others if you are cautious of what you watch.  How sad that what could have been a good family video had to be messed up with foul language.,1293408000,14,427,3.8181818181818183
3481607,5,B001B3LILA,"One of my favorites for the Christmas season and one I watch every year.  Starts off with a beautiful widow mom and her young son who feels his mom needs a husband. Their handsome (and single) neighbor is a man who has been friends with them for years and babysits her son when she needs someone to sit with him while she does her volunteer work. She rents a building where she feeds the homeless during the holidays of Thanksgiving and Christmas - a tradition started by her deceased husband which she continue to uphold with pride.  Meanwhile, there is a company who is looking to promote a special children's contest for Christmas that they end up calling ""What you want most for Christmas"".  Obviously, you have the usual fanfare of contestant kids asking for cars, vacations, etc., until her son decides to join and says 'that what he wants most for Christmas is a husband for his mom'.  They feel this is the best contestant and the boy wins the contest, BUT they want to go further with video taping and posting the ""Husband"" ad nationwide much to the dismay of the boy's mother who is not only surprised by her son's wish, but embarrassed as well. The rich company owner's son along the way gets romantically involved with the mother which does not meet with the approval of her son.  It is apparent to all viewers whom the son realizes whom he has wanted for a Dad and husband for his mom all along, but the story is still wonderful and has a lot of holiday Christmas Spirit.",1291852800,2,1484,4.481481481481482
3481608,3,B001B3LILA,"I enjoyed this Christmas story but was disappointed at the unnecessary and contrived storyline of the toy company competition. The acting was ok and the friendship to romance premise between the main characters was nicely developed and the Cinderella-like makeover was enjoyable to watch. The whole ""find my mum a husband"" competition winner, and subsequent media coverage of this seemed unnecessary and a little unbelievable.  The toy company executives were also a little one dimensional.  This part of the story seemed  contrived to me. The simple love story, with a little more character development, would have been enough to make this film more memorable.",1290556800,8,661,5.336538461538462

3481613,4,B001B3LILA,"Gail O'Grady plays a woman whose husband was a policeman killed in the line of duty when their son was two. Using his pension, she set up a community center in his name. They feed the homeless and offer after school activities for children. While Mom is serving the homeless, her own son, now 10, spends many of his after school hours with the kind man in the apartment across the hall--the closest thing to a father he has ever known. Her son decides she needs a husband and he enters the ""All I Want For Christmas"" contest sponsored by a toy company trying to boost sales. His entry is a sincere plea for a husband for his mom. He wins, of course, and his mom is none too thrilled, but decides to go along with it when she convinces the toy company that she will do it on the condition that they donate the 1/2 million dollars she needs to buy the building her community center is in before it is sold out from under them. As the story unfolds several people experience the ""maybe-what-I-wanted-isn't-really-what-I-want"" feeling .
Parents may want to know that there are a couple of incidents of profanity and one common swear word. The neighbor's girlfriend does make one comment that could be taken as slightly suggestive. The son is disrespectful in his attitude toward his mother's boyfriend on more than one occasion. Those are the only things I can think of that may bother anyone.
I may have given this 3 1/2 stars if that was an option because it is quite predictable. It has the common ""single parent dating the wrong person"" theme of so many Christmas movies, but the lead characters are people you can care about and it is nice to see a story about good people who aren't concerned with success as the world defines it, but want to make a difference in the lives of those who need help.",1258070400,41,1799,4.47112462006079
