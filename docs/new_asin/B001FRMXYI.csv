Maybe I am an old crab (could be!), but I found it to be a little amateurish and the background graphics kind of goofy for my taste. It didn't hold her attention at all, which defeats the purpose of purchasing this dvd. I will give to an acquaintance that just had a baby. Perhaps she will like it.",1354665600,,353,4.1911764705882355
8302446,5,B001FRMXYI,"I bought this when my daughter was a year old.  At that time, she wasn't able to really follow along with the video, but she loved the music and the exercises that I used her for resistance.  She would ask to exercise every day.  Now she is three, and she will pick up the DVD and ask to play it.  She now follows along with all the dance moves and exercise routines.

It isn't high energy, so don't expect to get a high powered exercise routine, but it is fun, and a good way to have some active time with your kids.  There are three different routines to choose from, aerobic, toning, or a combination of the two.  Each routine is around twenty minutes, and the activities within the routines are very short, to hold a child's attention span (or an adults, if you are like me and get bored easily with repetition.) :-)",1304553600,6,820,4.285714285714286
8302447,3,B001FRMXYI,"My son is 11 months, and I've been exercising while he naps.  I bought this thinking I could exercise with him, and then have his nap time to do other things...  He didn't seem to care one way or another, but I didn't feel it was as good a work-out as my Weight Watcher's DVD.  The movements seemed very repetitive and not very long.  It felt more like an active playtime than a workout.  It will probably be fun when he is older.",1237766400,,430,4.132530120481928
