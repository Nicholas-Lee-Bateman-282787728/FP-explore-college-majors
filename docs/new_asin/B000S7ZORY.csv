8204651,5,B000S7ZORY,"After viewing this film again after many years, I still enjoy it. I pity those who are so intelligent, so wise, so experienced in cinema expertise , and so smug that they miss the whole point of this film. This story is not for cynics who seek to condemn rather than to enjoy a simple tale of unspoiled innocence and the first experience of true love. All that is required to enjoy this film is the ability and willingness to let the events unfold and enjoy them for what they are and what they represent, not for an excuse to exercise one's intellectual superiority. Jane Powell is believable in her role, as is Dana Andrews. The cast members are committed to their roles, and the ending left me with a sincere sadness. True, I may be a lame brained cretin because I enjoyed this film for how it made me feel, instead of damning it to some intellectual's rubbish heap, but I will always contend that ""Enchanted Island"" deserves more respect than it has received.",1498089600,,963,4.508571428571429
8204652,2,B000S7ZORY,"ENCHANTED ISLAND (1958) was a dreadful mistake in the career of Jane Powell, who here is a cannibal princess! It's also one of the absolute last RKO pictures. This one's so bad the New York Times didn't waste the ink to review it.

Co-stars a besotted Dana Andrews. Directed by Alan Dwan from a loose adaptation of Herman Melville's semi-autobiographical novel ""Typee."" Powell is less-than-believeable as the whiter-than-milk South Seas islander, while Andrews is a total mistake as the sailor who loves his little carnivorous gal. The in-color Hawaiian settings are pleasant, but not enough to keep this one from drowning in a bubbling cauldron usually reserved for missionaries.",1341964800,,680,5.238532110091743
