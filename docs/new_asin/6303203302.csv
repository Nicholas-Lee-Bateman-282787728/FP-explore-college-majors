It has not lost anything with the passage of time. The sets are rich and opulent, the acting terrific and so is the quality of the sound.

594146,4,6303203302,"There are moments in ""The Betsy"" where you think you're watching something as profound as ""The Godfather"" before you pinch yourself and realize you are watching what is essentially schlock.  Entertaining, well-crafted schlock but schlock nonetheless.  It's Harold Robbins for goodness sake.  Credit director Daniel Petrie and his scriptwriters for fashioning a film that is almost respectable.  A first-rate cast is assembled to give the film some gravity led by Laurence Olivier as a scion of an auto empire who is as ruthless in the boardroom as he is in his personal relationships.  A young Tommy Lee Jones impresses as an ambitious auto racer.  Absolutely luminous are Lesley Anne Down as a gold-digging Brit and Kathleen Beller as Olivier's granddaughter.  I've never read a Harold Robbins book the film feels like one of those page turners you read on a lazy summer day.",1138320000,14,876,5.083916083916084
594147,5,6303203302,"I love this movie, it's one of my top 10 favorites. It's glitzy and it dazzles me, and it's just the kind of movie that gives me sweet dreams and one you'll love to cozy up with on a Saturday night. It's so very lavish and everything in this movie is just beautiful and huge!! Everything about this movie is on such a grand scale, everything is just so big and gorgeous, the mansion is again just gorgeous, the rooms are perfectly and beautifully decorated and the colors that are used are just dreamy, the flower arrangements are also huge and they sit atop huge fireplaces, this movie is just a feast for the eyes! (I found that I watched it again so that I could rewind and rewind just to feast on the sets!)  For the most part, the movie stays pretty close to the storyline of the book, and the book was again a huge and wonderful read, (which I also suggest!) My husband also liked this movie, he liked the actors and the storyline, the cars, the racing and the bird's eye view of the auto industry, and one of his favorite actress is Leslie Ann Downs. The flashbacks made me feel like I had slipped back in time, and oh I also just loved how Betsy got her man, the little swim she took... (she's the same actress who played the little girl on Make Room For Daddy with Danny Thomas--I think?). Lawrence O is in my opinion, very sexy and magnetic and perfect for the part, he's very handsome and even though I had never seen him before in any other movie, whew, what a cutie he is, even for an older man!  But I love Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. And yes, I totally agree with the viewer who said there was no chemistry between any of the actors and that Tommy Lee rushed through his lines like he was in a hurry to get to an audition for Coal Miner's Daughter (I had a good laugh at this!), but still he's young and cute and he does not disappoint. I love movies with good actors, pretty sets, lovely clothes, romance and happy endings and any movie that goes back in time or ia a period piece, gets my vote every single time.",1082592000,6,2036,4.217948717948718
594148,5,6303203302,"There's so much awfulness to love in this movie, a camp classic done as straight as an arrow.
I have a hard time figuring out what's my favorite thing about this movie because there's so much to love -- the total miscasting? Olivier's ""Americanish"" accent which is frequently slurred? The complete lack of chemistry between any of the principle characters?  That ""Where's My Paycheck?"" look on Katherine Ross' face?  The way Tommy Lee Jones spits out his lines so quickly like he needs to leave the set early to go to the Coal Miner's Daughter audition? ...  The heavily gauzed-lens flashbacks?  The complete implausibility of Harold Robbins' story?  Mansions decorated with whicker furniture?  Sir Larry's parade of horrendous toupees?
If you miss Dynasty or The Colbys for any of the above reasons, or if you are just a connoisseur of So-Bad-They're-Great movies you can't miss this one.  ...",1021507200,13,894,5.0

This is my go-to Guilty Pleasure! As another reviewer said 'It's so bad, it good'! That is my sentiment exactly, sometimes as I am watching it, I find myself saying out loud to Laurence Olivier ""What were you thinking, Hamlet?"", and then I remember 'The Jazz Singer"" and all is forgiven and I go on watching. Now, Tommy Lee Jones was so sexy in this film, even with his clothes on that I was mesmerized the first time I saw this in 1978 as a 18 year old. I have never forgotten the scene between him and Kathleen Beller, oh boy!!!!  I have a list of probably 25 films that fit into the guilty pleasure category, but The Betsy is at the top of the list for sure.

The story is your typical ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"" intrigue story, but set in the automotive industry which gives you somewhat of an idea what that is like in the USA.

594366,5,6303203302,"Was without a doubt the greatest actor's of his generation. This film is a superb producion that is nothing but talent. It is also a reminder of what a depressing time the mid 70s were. Oliver's character summed up 1970s Detroit.  ""  Too mercenary to adapt to new times "".  By this time all the industry founders were dead and the bean counters ruled who cared only about the next quarter and their own bonuses.  One thing I did not like was the name of the film it sounds too cheesy.",1376870400,,484,4.285714285714286

The world would be a better place!!!
But really, the acting for the time - was about as good as it gets. The storyline held my interest but the bed jumping did not. I only rated this film 'okay' because it should have at the time it was produced made Detroit stand up and take notice but it failed to do the job.

Plus a young Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall and Katherine Ross was great!!The scene most remembered was the scenes with Kathleen Beller in the pool-what a beauty!!I guess the conection with the Ford family in some respects was underlined(the overbearing Henry Ford over Edsel Ford kind of)but everything else was a hollywood fabrication!!The Ford family will always have the controlling interest-but it was an interesting story line about the young upstart race car driver(Tommy Lee)getting the company and the grand daughter(Kathleen Beller)over the old patriarch(Lawrence Olivier)while putting a small turbine powered economy car on the market for mass production(would never happen! ask Chrysler!!)-must have been during the OPEC oil crisis days?The end scene was the best with Lawrence Olivier saying he figured out where Tommy Lee got his option money to buy the stock for the controlling interest(from his uncle in the mafia)and that he can be controlled like his grandfather(deported)-fantastic!!There's some great acting here-watch it and enjoy!!it's a time capsule!!Note:This is an older movie done in 4:3 aspect ratio not widescreen-Thanks,1366070400,4,1329,5.456310679611651

594458,1,6303203302,"There aren't enough lousy adjectives to describe this dated piece of coal - and like coal - this should be tossed into a fire for warmth, thereby receiving something worthwhile in return for wasting your time.

This is a classic example of why writers like Jackie Collins and Harold Robbins are not renown for their great literary contributions or the efforts to bring their melodrama to the screen - this being a prime example.

I can think of two good things to say about this ridiculous 'extravaganza'.

First, you can witness how the passage of time can sometimes be used to better one's self. This early Tommy Lee Jones flick proves you can get better, infinitely better, as you practice and hone your craft. Yikes, he was HORRIBLE back then. You would've never, absolutely never, guess he'd win an Oscar one day.

Second, the surprising amount of adult content for a US-released mainstream film. Full frontal nudity and the suggestion of fellatio was extremely rare in 1978 for a non-exploitation movie. I was shocked. I've only seen one other film from this period, again, in a mainstream release, that visually captured such raw sexuality.

Otherwise, this should be shown to film students as a showcase of bad acting, terrible scriptwriting, unrealistic sets/stage design and wholly ridiculous storytelling. And let's not even discuss Sir Laurence Olivier's accent.

I am curious how the producers got Robert Duvall hooked into this piece of trash? Money? Lose a bet? It makes one wonder.",1299196800,2,1497,4.991967871485944

594462,2,6303203302,"Despite the lavish costumes and fantastic sets used in this film and the all-star cast, Olivier, Jones, Duvall. Ross, Alexander, and Herman, the film will appeal to fans of shows like ""Dynasty,"" ""Knots Landing,"" and ""The Colbys"" all popular dramas from the 80's.  The characters are rather interesting, yet it is a shame they are not given enough screen time to develop or be fully appreciated by the audience--Duvall's character in particular. In some cases they blend too easily into the background and are hardly noticed like the many props and set decorations used in this film.

Tommy Lee Jones, although an actor with tremendous range, is terribly miscast as Angelo Perino, the race car driver who wrests control over Olivier's auto empire via manipulation and outright seduction. With his Southern accent, and his gangly manner, he hardly seems the type the would sweep his sophisticated female castmates off their feet.  And as a romantic lead he fails miserably.  A writer of limited appeal today, Harold Robbins' novel deserves better, but this film dilutes too much of the novel's appeal--primarily the characters--but instead focuses on sex or the boundless sexual exploits of its principal chracters, and in many instances a mere excuse for a scene change, or a blackfash.

Seeing Olivier, an actor I have always respected, in a scene feverishly boinking a maid in his employ at his son's wedding reception and then seducing his own daughter in law (Katherine Ross), is a bit much.  Despite a timely storyline, with Olivier, following Henry Ford's model, to design a fuel-efficient car (hybrids, anyone?) for the general population that gets at least 60 miles to the gallon and well-within the average American's budget, this entertaining and interesting plotline is pushed aside for a storyline that merely moves from boardroom to bedroom and back again.

Kathleen Beller, few remember today and of severely limited range would later appear on televison's ""Dynasty,"" makes an auspicious debut into feature films in ""The Betsy"" in a scene with full-frontal nudity--not exactly what I expected for a feature film circa 1978. Sure, Harold Robbins might write what we consider ""trash,"" but even his novels deserved better treatment than given in this film.

Tommy Lee Jones will be the brave test driver to add some steamy love scenes with Kathleen Beller (including her big dark eyes) and Lesley Ann Down. We add the flashbacks: Olivier's not such a great guy after all having an affair with daughter in law (Katherine Ross) and hiring gangsters to murder his son's homosexual lover. Harold Robbins was a curse to filmland and two stars is rare for a review of any of his films.

7840816,2,6303203302,"The Betsy is a stupendously bad (and often unintentionally funny) Godfather ripoff, except that instead of the mafia, this film centers on that most glamorous, torrid world -- the Detroit auto industry.

The cast of this film is stellar, leaving one mystified at how such a risable script attracted a line-up which includes Laurence Olivier, a young Tommy-Lee Jones, Leslie-Anne Down, Katherine Ross, Robert Duvall, Jane Alexander, Ed Herrmann and Joseph Wiseman.

Olivier plays an aging car executive, who recruits Formula One driver Jones to help design a modest, fuel-efficient car for regular folks, dubbed ""The Betsy"" (after Olivier's great-grandaughter, to whom Jones has taken a shine).

Somehow this mundane endeavor inspires an implausible barrage of backstabbings, corporate espionage, revenge and even murder -- as well as no shortage of tawdry affairs and hilariously gratuitous sex scenes. Obviously looking to The Godfather Part II for inspiration, The Betsy intercuts between the present day efforts to create the car, and extended flashbacks to the 1930s which depict Olivier's greener days -- and the disintegration of his family (with no shortage of stilted characterizations and corny dialog in either era).

Olivier does do an excellent job I have to say, but otherwise this film is a complete turkey, which often feels like a bad soap opera. It's only saving grace is John Barry's music -- but sadly he doesn't get the chance to do a whole lot, though there are two or three exceedingly lovely moments in the score.

Definitely good for some laughs though!",1489795200,,1577,5.217391304347826
