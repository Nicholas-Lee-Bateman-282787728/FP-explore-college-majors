1055320,5,6305583714,"I was fascinated from beginning to end. I laughed (literally out loud) and felt tugs at my heart at other times. I believe that the tough outer core of this man is a result of (as Alan Berliner's mother said,) pride -- a lifetime of pride. Despite his reactions, I doubt that he really never thought again about some of the information that he learned during the interview or that he never again looked at the pictures of his grandparents, to find a resemblance. Either way, I completely enjoyed the interview and the snappy exchanges.",1439164800,,535,4.6421052631578945
1055321,4,6305583714,"It was a privilege to get to know Alan Berliner's father in all his cranky honesty.  Kudos to the film maker for his loving patience!  Due to him so often responding with recalcitrance, I found myself wondering what had happened to harden this once really handsome, still intelligent man.  Yes, his marriage was not what he'd hoped for, but there had to be more.  Subtle hints were present about the emotional climate in which he'd grown up, including that family intimacies were never discussed, family background was invisible, and his parents' anniversary was not celebrated (at least not in his memory).  It's OK that the movie didn't tell me more to answer that sense of why, however.

I was still glad to get to know him, as well as some other members of the family.  It was a rare chance to sort of visit with someone I'd not otherwise have met.  Seeing Mr. Berliner light up around his grandchild was especially delightful, given the tough crust exterior he presented the rest of the time.  It made me wish he could spend part of every day with that grandchild.

My father was of the elder Mr. Berliner's generation, and he held some of the same traditional attitudes about life and marriage.  When Mr. Berliner told his son that winning grants to make films seen the world over, could not be considered a real job, and was instead a waste of God-given talents, I smiled.  Though it may have been painful for the film maker to hear at the time (& if so, my sympathies), it nevertheless was a mindset I recognized.  To me, it derives from a circumscribed world view that both Mr. Berliner and my father had adopted, and neither of them were about to be talked out of it.  Stubborn men like that who are also decent people must be accepted as they are (for better and for worse), because what they are giving is the best they can give.  I saw that acceptance in this video.  Thank you for making it, Alan Berliner.",1438387200,,1920,4.521739130434782

1055325,5,6305583714,"Alan Berliner is an Emmy award winning Documentarian who makes extremely personal movies and this is his best. It's a film that shows everyone has an interesting story. That everyone is someone deep inside and that everyone really has much to say whether they want to or not.

Alan decides to make a film about the most antagonistic and difficult interviewee there has ever been put on film: his father. He believes that no one wants to hear his story and that no one should care about it. But his story is fascinating, his life so full of events, happy and sad. It's the kind of film where you watch it and your outlook on life changes. A terrific, poignant, and wonderful film that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth.",1397692800,2,719,4.488549618320611
1055326,4,6305583714,"This is must viewing for anyone who has ever wanted to capture the family history, or just honest answers about the family, and come up against a relative who couldn't give a hoot about history or ancestors, and says what happened in the family is ""Nobody's Business.""  Berliner, the father, here protests constantly, yet we can read behind his lines, partly because he is a lonely man, and partly because his son catches the ""self-revealing narrator"" aspects of his protest. According to one account of the public screening of this sweet film, Alan's father tells a relative that it is the happiest night of his life. Knowing this before I watched it made me see it through that lens, which made it all the more moving.",1379808000,4,720,4.714285714285714
1055327,5,6305583714,"The strongest and most affecting of Alan Berliner's impressive list of quirky, personal documentaries to date. This
study of his cantankerous, difficult, if also very bright (and buried under the surface, quite human) father is both
very funny and sometimes very sad. Berliner captures perfectly the buttons that parents push in children and
vice-versa as their interviews together often turn into angry verbal sparring matches.

And yet, by the end of the film, you can feel how much the gap between the two men has narrowed through the
process, and that Berliner is left with more love and less anger and confusion about the man who raised him.

A very personal document, that paradoxically becomes more universal for daring to be so intimate and real.",1373241600,,754,5.024

Who do they think they are to imagine that anyone would care about them? They had nothing to say. If I saw Alan Berliner I might spit on him.

One good thing, it didn't put me to sleep. Just made me angry.

7892492,5,6305583714,"This was a very real and entertaining documentary. The mix of early day photos and videos of Alan's father and family as he converses with his father as a backdrop, made this very personal. The father who is obviously lonely but wants to be left to conceal his feelings, made me both laugh and feel sad for him. The way he views his family reminds me of my husband and his family. He doesn't seem to care about or want to be bothered with them. This is hard for me to comprehend because I come from a family who is close. The filmmaker did an outstanding job, from his interviews with other family, the information he searched out about his grandfather and great grandfather, and best of all the dialogue his has with his father. I very rarely watch a documentary twice, but I absolutely plan to watch this again.",1465516800,,813,4.426666666666667
