I recently went looking for this movie as we had moved quite some time ago and hadn't been able to rent it. This movie is just as good as I remember it! Spectacular costumes, acting, songs and very very funny .  This is a must see for all ages!!!",993772800,,403,3.7976190476190474

488587,5,6302636671,"Here's a chance to see a different version of Sleeping Beauty.  When I bought the doll for my granddaughters they already had the Disney production, which we all love.  But this one has real people in it.  So it was a chance to see the story from another perspective.  There is also a sleeping beauty ballet available.  I wanted the children to see that it's okay to vary the content of folklore, that it comes down to us through the ages and changes as it goes.  That is the nature of folk tales.  The sets, costumes and acting are all well done.  Nothing spectacular, but it was enjoyable.",1405987200,,591,4.407407407407407
488588,5,6302636671,"I remember watching this when I was younger, and I simply had to sing along! The songs are so fun and I love the dance sequences. The story is a classic, but they were able to give it a fantastic twist with some wonderful, new characters. I would definantly recommend this movie for any family to enjoy together! If you enjoy musicals, definantly give this one a try.",1284681600,,367,4.411764705882353

488592,5,6302636671,Why is there no Region 1 DVD release of Sleeping Beauty available? All of the other Cannon Movietales (except this and the Frog Prince)are available. I think it is unfair that the two best ones are not available. Please release this and the Frog Prince on region 1 DVD. Pretty please!!!,1186358400,3,286,4.627450980392157
488593,4,6302636671,"I'd say this version is second best to the disney version. It has some nice characters and the songs are cute. I like ""quickly now quickly"",""dare me"", and ""slumber"" with great vocals from the prince. I also like how the fairys do a slow motion ballet dance to the sleeping beauty waltz. I'd reccomend this but you should see the disney version first.",1169942400,,350,4.571428571428571
488604,5,6302636671,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!!!! I saw it for the first time when I was really young like 5 or 6 my parents taped it off t.v. for me. I remember sitting and watching the movie everyday for like a year. Now I'm 16 and I still love it. The dances and songs are beautiful. I just found my tape it's getting really worn out and I'm excited to find it on tape for sale. If you haven't seen this movie yet you should it's wonderful!,1142640000,,425,3.896551724137931

488606,4,6302636671,"This version of SLEEPING BEAUTY, part of the Cannon MovieTales series, is a real charmer.

The story is told pretty much as we all remember, but with a few new touches.  A childless King and Queen are given a magical potion by a kindly elf.  When the lovely Princess Rosebud is born, all the fairies are invited to bestow gifts upon the child.  However, due to a miscounting of the golden dinner plates, the fearsome Red Fairy is left off the guest-list.  Enraged, she gatecrashes the event and curses Rosebud to a premature death from the prick of a spindle.  The wise White Fairy remedies the curse by changing the death to sleep, and the awakening of Rosebud with the kiss of true love.  In the meanwhile, all spindles are banned from the kingdom.

In the passing years, with all the clothes in the kingdom dissolved to rags because of the absence of spindles and sewing-needles, the King and Queen travel to the far reaches and bring back reams of fabrics.  During their absence, the Red Fairy sees the perfect opportunity to see her curse come true...

Morgan Fairchild, Tahnee Welch, Jane Weidlin and Sylvia Miles all offer fine performances in this adaptation of the oft-told fairytale.  There is a certain campy charm about the Cannon MovieTales series, which were filmed rather economically in Israel (and you'll notice that many of the films have the same sets).  The score isn't terribly complex but is enjoyable and features ""Spin Spin Spin"", ""Life is Rosier Today"" and ""Slumber"".  Even Tchaikovsky's famed score is used for the christening scene.

Charming family viewing.",1123200000,16,1585,4.843866171003717

488608,5,6302636671,"I first saw this movie on TV when I was really little...like, 6, maybe. My mom taped it off of TV, and I watched it all the time. I couldn't find the video that my mom taped it for a few years, then about 3 years ago I found it...and annoyed my mom when I watched it again, and again, and again...I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I am 19 and I still love this movie...my friends and family think I am crazy, because of my age...but the movie is absolutly beautiful, and the songs are so memmorable.

488609,5,6302636671,"As much as I love the classic Disney version of this tale, there is definitely something that must be said for such a beautiful live action film.  Part of the legendary (and impossible to find) Cannon Movie Tales series, Sleeping Beauty is an enchanting classical treat!  The sets, costumes, songs, and actors are all beautifully ""spun"" together to create the perfect family viewing experience.  Sylvia Miles should recieve an award for her LARGER THAN LIFE portrayal of the angry Red Fairy....oooh!
  It's quite simply an enveloping, mesmerising film.  If you can still find a copy of this one, get it!",1048982400,15,603,4.98

I saw it when i was 3and still love it i just saw it againyesterday alot of my friends want to see it too get all three moderen day fairy tales snow white the faires of them all,ever after and red riding hood",1035763200,4,438,4.045977011494253
488611,5,6302636671,"This is my favorite fairy tale version of Sleeping Beauty.  It's timeless.  The customs are great.  I watched it hundreds of times, renting it...but now I want my own copy so I can watch it hundreds of more times.  :-)",1022716800,3,218,4.375
488612,4,6302636671,"I first watched this movie when I was just a little girl, so I probably love this movie partly because of the nostalgia it creates. But saying that, this is also a good movie in itself - a reasonably faithful retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty tale, and any dramatic liberties it takes only enhance the plot line. Morgan Fairchild plays the sad Queen who longs above all things for a child and Kenny Baker (who I think is the guy they stuff into R2D2 every time a Star Wars movie is made) is the elf who vows to help her by brewing up a magical potion. It works, and in a few months the Princess Rosebud is born. On her christening day, the fairies gather at her crib to bless her with their individual virtues - beauty, wit, grace, poetry and so on. But because one of the fairies' nine golden plates were missing, one fairy has been crossed off the list - the Fairy Red, who is none to pleased to be excluded. She curses the baby, vowing that on her sixteenth year she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and 'drop down dead'. However, not all hope is lost as the Fairy of White - who was late getting to the party - eases the curse. Rosebud will not die, but instead sleep for one hundred years till she is awoken by love's first kiss. Aw[...]
Although the costumes and sets may look a bit dated now, the costumes of all the supernatural characters still look fresh and vibrant, from the elves' feathery clothes to the fairies' sweeping, floating dresses. The songs are beautiful too - look out especially for the Fairy of White's ""Quickly, now Quickly,"" Rosebud's ""Something in the Dark"" the Prince's ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the triumphant ""How Good It Is"". Dancing is outstanding as well, especially the fairies' graceful slow-motion ballet dance to Tchaikovsky's original score is wonderfully choreographed and performed.
One thing that did bother me though, is that apart from Rosebud, nobody had any names! The Queen was simply 'the Queen', the Elf was just 'The Elf' the Prince was merely 'The Prince'. Some names to personalise everyone would have been nice.
It might be funny to see Morgan Fairchild in such a role, but she pulls it off really well and Kenny Baker and David Holliday as the King get most of the laughs. Although I must confess I thought the Prince (Nicholas Clay) was 'icky' when I was a kid, he is a pretty good Prince Charming, and has a great singing voice. Sylvia Miles is pretty darn scary as the Fairy of Red (sensitive kids might need a grown-up present) and Star Trek fans might recognise Jane Wiedlin as the lovely Fairy of White.
All in all, this is a great treat for fairy-tale fans and it is successfully funny, scary, sad and joyful.
I would also recommend to fairy-tale lovers - ""The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns"", a new take on a familiar story.",1018051200,7,2803,4.519685039370079
488613,5,6302636671,This movie is a beautiful take on the classic tale. It introduces characters that children will love and want to see over and over again. Morgan Fairchild and Tahnee Welch give stunning performances as the queen and the sleeping beauty. If you like the Disney movie you'll love this. I first saw this movie when I was in the hospital with my cousin who had a brain tumor. i had to have it over the years I coudn't find it or rent it. I thought it was out of print so I never dared to look here until one day I said what the heck and found it. I love this movie and if you are a 14 yr old actor you'll love it too of course you'll love it even if you aren't a 14 yr old actor.,994550400,4,675,3.8633093525179856

For us it was fine.  But it's much closer to the original literature than Disney's version.  It's a ballet drama.  The princess is ""Rosebud"" and she isn't raised by fairies.  The king banishes spinning wheels and spindles and gets into the consequences of no spindles.  No cloth.  Not what she expected,  but we all enjoyed it!",1477094400,,491,4.807228915662651
