4661663,5,B005DTGAXO,"Home By Christmas

  Linda Hamilton is so naive and tender playing the part of Julia Bedford in this delightful movie. Completely oblivious to her husbands affair she is devastated by the discovery of a love note in his coat pocket. Julia is left next to nothing in the divorce, her daughter that she adores wants to live with dad, she is mugged causing her to lose everything that she was working so hard to keep. Julia is forced to live in her car, eat free food samples at the mall and weigh what is really important in her life. It will take some good advice from a new friend and love from a new relationship to help her turn it around.

Holiday Switch

  With only a week before Christmas, Paula (Nicole Eggert)is feeling anything but Christmas spirit. She is tired of struggling with paying bills and being married to her blue-collar husband Gary and being a mother to her 2 daughters. When Nick, her wealthy high school boyfriend opens an art gallery in her hometown she wonders if she chose the wrong man. When Paula wishes that she had chosen Nick all those years ago she finds herself mysteriously transformed into her new life...thanks to the help of her clothes dryer. At first, being Nick's wife seems to be the answer to her prayers. But, as she will soon discover that the grass isn't always greener on the other side! Seeing Gary happily married to his old high school girlfriend and raising her daughters makes her realize that her true dream is to have her old life back.",1350259200,4,1490,4.537313432835821

8467413,5,B005DTGAXO,Linda Hamilton would never been my choice for an actress in the first movie.  She seems to be a tough actress...and if her husband had money why didn't she get her nails done.  That hair do for the red dress scene was a finger in the light socket job.  I bought the movie because of the story line.  The black actress was sooo much better than Hamilton for that matter so were the male actors.  I've seen Hamilton in other movies and she was very good.  This script and a well done script plays out for many women.  To go from street to success is the theme and for this I give the movie a 5... If they do a remake thank heaven Hamilton will be too old for it.,1503187200,,660,4.030769230769231
