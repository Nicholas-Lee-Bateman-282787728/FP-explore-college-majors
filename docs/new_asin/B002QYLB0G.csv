8739148,3,B002QYLB0G,This movie was based on the book Joy by Victoria Christopher Murray. It was one of the first books I read when I started reading Christian novels. My opinion of the movie is that I thought the scenes could have flowed a little better and the actors were just okay for me. But overall it did portray the book and the great message of love and forgiveness. It makes you think about what would you do in that situation. So I encourage people to see it for themselves and form their own opinion.,1355702400,,491,4.290322580645161
8739149,4,B002QYLB0G,"What would I do? That was one of the first questions that came to my mind when I first read the book ""Joy"" by Victoria Christopher Murray. The story revolves around Anya, a successful business woman, engaged to an equally successful man, and outlines the joys and frustrations of her life. In the midst of it all, however, Anya never loses her faith, even when the unthinkable happens.

Leo Hall and LaughCryThink Films did an awesome job bringing this film to life. It was both entertaining and thought provoking. There were many obstacles Anya had to navigate. Many questions she had to answer. What would I do? Watch the movie and ask yourself - What would you do?",1331942400,,667,4.6525423728813555
