8272994,3,B0019974SW,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released.  And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events.  These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

No Mercy 2002 was an event that had good action overshadowed by crappy storylines.  At this time, WWE was trying to ""think outside the box"" when it came to their creative process which resulted in a lot of questionable storylines & booking so if you can get past all of that, you'll enjoy this PPV.  The SD main event featured the Hell In The Cell match with Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar which was a very brutal & bloody match.  Also on here is the beginning of the series of classic tag team matches for the new WWE Tag Team Titles in Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit vs. Rey Mysterio & Edge (Los Guerreros would later be included in the series).
The downside to this card was the bad Torrie Wilson/Dawn Marie match & RAW main event where it was a World/Intercontinental Title unification match between Triple H & Kane that was based around the whole Katie Vick storyline which honestly I don't want to repeat because I'll sound stupid for remembering it but Jerry Lawler wouldn't stop talking about it throughout the match to the point where you had to mute the TV & just wanted the match over.  The other matches on the card that were from average to good include RVD vs. Flair, Jericho/Christian vs. Booker/Goldust, Noble/Tajiri, and Trish/Victoria.

The 2003 version of No Mercy was another story as this PPV was just a two match PPV as the rest of the card just fell completely flat.  Undertaker & Brock once again fought for the WWE Title but this time it was a Biker Chain (on a pole) Match that was real good but didn't (and couldn't) top their previous Cell match.  Also on this card, Kurt Angle fought John Cena to one of Cena's best ""wrestling"" matches in his career & Mysterio vs. Tajiri had a great opener.  The rest of the card as I stated was just a complete flop as Big Show defeated Eddie Guerrero for the U.S. Title in a match that played to Guerrero's weaknesses more than his giving the performances he's known for, Vince & Stephanie had a ""I Quit"" match that just wasn't good at all, the Bashams & A.P.A. was just decent, Benoit couldn't carry A-Train to a good performance as Matt Hardy couldn't do the same with Zach Gowen.

In the end, I would suggest trying to find a copy of the 2002 edition of No Mercy for a cheaper price but if you can't then I would recommend this set.

As a side note for those looking for certain matches on other sets:
Hell In The Cell Match with Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker is on Brock Lesnar's DVD, Undertaker's Anthology, and the ""Complete Hell"" DVD
Vince McMahon vs. Stephanie McMahon is on the ""McMahon"" DVD
Kurt Angle vs. John Cena on the the John Cena ""Word Life"" DVD",1217548800,2,3008,4.447272727272727
