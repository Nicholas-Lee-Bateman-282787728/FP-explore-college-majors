8379002,5,B002S3UOIU,"This is a great video which covers a lot of material ranging from basic set up to fairly complex maintenance things on banjos. The material is logicly organized and is clearly presented often with a little humor thrown in.

I do my own set up on all my banjos and I still learned a great deal from this video. So no matter whether you just like to tinker with your banjo or you are serious about doing set up and luthier work this video offers a lot of good, solid 'how to' information. The production quality is excellent and all scenes throughout the video are clear and easy to see.

In short, this is an excellent reference video for the entire banjo community.",1268352000,4,665,4.3983739837398375
