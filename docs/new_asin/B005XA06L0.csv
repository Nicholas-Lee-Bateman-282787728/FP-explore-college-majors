4902420,4,B005XA06L0,"This set has 15 episodes, all of the season 3 episodes and the two part prequel Xana Awakens. While Season 2 has visual hiccups, the video quality from Season 3 has an overall ongoing problem, namely that many diagonal and curved lines look rather...pixelacious. Season 2 didn't really have this problem, and it's fairly consistent through the season. But that was the only visual problem I had and once again sound was perfectly fine.

Episode 62 has some problems with a couple of lines of dialogue not going with their obvious pictures (the first one was Yumi talking and Jeremy being on the screen, looking like he was talking when he clearly was not, the second was Ulrich speaking and once again showing Jeremy, the line looked rather rushed a result. I'm guessing it was in the source material as I understand this problem is on the iTunes version too). I get the feeling that the DVD printer couldn't have fixed this, so I don't think it's their fault, but it should be noted it's there.

The rest of my review about Season 2 pretty much holds the same here, same type of menus, another good DVD case with barebones artwork, episodes all in order, etc.

Once again, there's no reason to double dip if you have the iTunes version, but for Lyoko fans who have been waiting for years, the set is more than worth it.",1328313600,2,1320,4.561181434599156

4902426,5,B005XA06L0,"Finally saw this season for the first time in years. And I'm very happy I got it. I only watched up to season 2 when I was younger and watching this on Cartoon Network. I don't know what happened but I never saw it again. I was a young person and my attention span was very short, so I just went about my life. It wasn't until years later I found out they had two new seasons. So I definitely wanted to watch them and I did and I loved them. Huge Lyoko fan!",1357776000,,457,3.872340425531915

4902428,5,B005XA06L0,"I have been watching this ever since I was little and it was, for a time, the only thing I ever watched on TV. now it's on DVD and I love it. It is about a group of teens who go in to fight a virus on a super computer named X.A.N.A and stop it from coming out and taking over the world. In this season, they get the skid which allows them to explore the digital sea. With this they realize that there are replicas of all the other sectors. With each replica, X.A.N.A increases in power. Now the question the need to know is how many replicas are there? Now I do have to say there are two cons to consider here:

1)The show does get  quite repetitive at times. there is very little change in the main objective to each episode though the objective does change slightly with the 2nd season and a lot with the last two.

2)These videos are printed on DVD-R disks. That means that some DVD players will not be able to play these disks. be sure to know your DVD player and it's limits before buying this.

Overall, I have to say that if your into anime and don't mind the fast talking, repetitive nature, and love computers and science fiction; then this show is a must have.",1352505600,,1170,4.163716814159292
