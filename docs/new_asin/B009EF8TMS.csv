8540590,5,B009EF8TMS,"Nicholai Cuti has had my respect and admiration for years.  ""Lost in Transit"" is a great production that does not fail to entertain, and live up to Mr
Cuti's space opera leanings. I enjoyed the film, while only 30 plus minutes, it was a satisfying view.

The casting is good all the way round, and while a small budget Indy, it looks like a far more expensive film than I guess it was.  The power of digital is immeasurable.

Having watched many Christmas films, I would rather watch a space theme over a puppy saves Christmas.

Brittany Rodriguez and Catherine Epstein are excellent in their roles.  Not a bad performance in the bunch.

Keep up the good work Mr Cuti.",1350950400,,668,4.516666666666667

A fine gift for holiday/ family viewing.
What do you get when a great sic-fi writer writes a family/Christmas story?
