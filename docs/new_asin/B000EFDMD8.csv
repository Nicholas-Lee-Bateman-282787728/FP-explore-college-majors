2517467,5,B000EFDMD8,I have been working with children of special needs and let me just say that this tape is very enlightening. I even had parents watch it. I can only say that there is a clear improvement in the way parents interact with their child and their child with them!!!! Great video,1288656000,,272,4.352941176470588
2517468,5,B000EFDMD8,"As a teacher, parent of an LD child, and now social worker....this video changed my life...I cannot say enough about Dr. LaVoie's teaching in these videos....every parent, child care provider, social worker, and teacher...well, just about everyone should watch these videos...",1283472000,,276,5.7560975609756095
2517469,5,B000EFDMD8,"""F.A.T. City"" and ""Beyond F.A.T. City: A Look Back, A Look Ahead""

These two videos should be considered a ""must"" see for parents with an LD child.  After viewing these, parents should gift the school with a copy.  All educators and staff, including the principals, teachers, secretaries and custodians should be required to view these.  Let's get the discussion started and everyone will win.",1243036800,3,393,5.09375
2517470,5,B000EFDMD8,"This video should be seen by every teacher.  Parents with LD kids, too.  Anyone - because all of us have something, some more than others.  What struck me the most is Lavoie's statement that what is ""fair,"" in terms of special treatment for LD kids versus non LD kids has nothing to do with making sure things are equal for all, but that each kid gets what he or she needs.  That's what fair really is.  The simulation was very revealing as to how LD kids perceive things and how teachers (and parents) can make or break their learning experience.  He shed a lot of light and I appreciate the awareness I gained from it.  We've barely scraped the surface since this video was made in how we approach these kids.",1242345600,5,711,4.3816793893129775
2517471,5,B000EFDMD8,"As an elementary school teacher, this DVD was extremely helpful in learning more about some students' behaviors. Also it was helpful in organizing information to discuss with parents during conferences. The examples Rick Lavoie and audience members use to describe the various frustrations that learning disabled kids have is eye-opening. This is an excellent follow-up to the F.A.T. video/DVD.",1239753600,2,394,5.694915254237288
2517472,5,B000EFDMD8,"My son's psychiatrist recommended this video for us to view. It made me cry to view how my son may view the world, and learning in general. I would recommen it for every parent and educator who has to help a child with a learning disability.",1209340800,3,241,4.260869565217392
2517473,5,B000EFDMD8,"I was pleased to find some new information as well as to revisit what was originally in the FAT City video. Richard Lavoie amazes me in that he has a mantra that doesn't change over the years, but feels as fresh as the first time that I watched FAT City. I use the original video with as many teachers and teachers-in training as I can. I am never disappointed by their oohs and aahs as they either find something that lights a bulb for them or brings out an experience. This is the finest work on learning disabilities that I have ever come across. I recommend both the original and the follow-up for those who want to understand learning disabilities.

I am a teacher educator both in the US and abroad.",1193961600,25,705,4.3816793893129775

2517475,5,B000EFDMD8,"Richard Lavoie explains the world of LD students in ways that help parents and teachers to understand the Frustration, Anxiety, and Tension that dominate their school days.  As a teacher with a LD son, I have found this to be a valuable resource for me to help my son at home and I've shared this with my son's school as well since all too often I hear ""If he'd just pay attention, he'd do better.""  Well...that's tough to do when you have a processing problem and are still on Step 1 or 2 and the teacher's gone on to Step 8 already.  It's really helped my son to understand that he just learns differently and how how to ask for what he needs to help him learn.",1155513600,62,663,4.2047244094488185
2517476,5,B000EFDMD8,"If you are the parent, sibling, or other relative of someone with a learning disability, or if you are one with the condition, yourself, you will benefit by watching this video.
