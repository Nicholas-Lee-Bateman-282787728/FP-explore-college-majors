 Amazon has the release date for this package as Jan. 11th with a price of $25.00, but I bought it at Target on the 4th for $15.00. It really isn't even worth the lower price. If I had paid 25 for it, I would be really angry. I wasn't expecting Criterion Collection here. These are all public domain films that are available in several cheap editions. Never the less, when I first opened the package, I was excited. The packaging is inexpensive but tastefully done and there is a long booklet with bio's of the stars. (It mistakenly says that Gary Cooper stars in Penny Serenade instead of Cary Grant.) But when I played the discs, my hopes crashed. The prints are barely watchable. They are noisy, out of focus, high contrast, and full of splices. The best films here can all be gotten very cheaply in much better editions than this. I had thought that, if I wasn't entirely happy with this, I would give it to a friend who is just discovering classic films. But these prints are nearly impossible to enjoy. I'm afraid this fifteen dollars is going in the trash.",1294099200,35,1401,4.5476190476190474
