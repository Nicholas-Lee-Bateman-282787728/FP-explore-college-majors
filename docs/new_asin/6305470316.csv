7889867,4,6305470316,"Suspenseful, gripping film that has interesting twists avoiding cliche. A bit unique for a movie that has little promotional presence and therefore a pleasant surprise. Similar to a good book on the same topic. It seems to  have some budget aspects but has a good (even plausible) story and is well  presented with thought provoking elements.",948672000,12,342,5.089285714285714
