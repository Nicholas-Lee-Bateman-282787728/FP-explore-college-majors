4445278,4,B004QGYV8G,"This video gave a clear picture into the life of Grace Kelly.
I found it informative and entertaining.
She lived a very interesting life.",1368144000,,137,4.75
4445279,4,B004QGYV8G,"Good coverage of her years in Monaco. Compensates for less complete coverage of her early life and career, other romantic involvements.",1365811200,,135,5.476190476190476
4445280,3,B004QGYV8G,I grew up when Grace Kelly was still a starlet and wanted to know more about her.  It was mildly interesting and nothing more.,1365465600,,126,4.25
4445281,5,B004QGYV8G,This was a wonderfully done Bio on the life of Grace Kelly! Very inclusive...I'd highly recommend it to anyone! Excellent!,1359590400,,122,5.15
4445282,5,B004QGYV8G,"I first saw Grace Kelley in Hitchcock's Rear Window and fell in love with her forever. I could not believe how absolutely beautiful she was, and what type of a screen presence she had. This film showed me how she grew up, her family and their ethics, and how she developed into a great actress. It also shed light on her decision to marry into royalty, as she, herself, came from a family that was very regal in it's own way. She always took the high road and people fell in love with her very easily. Many actors and celebrities, but she chose a prince in the end and became a legend. I was glued to the story because it had so many ups and downs, but mostly because I couldn't take my eyes off of her! What a charming presence. And she was hard on herself, always trying to do better, till she finally got some recognition as an actress. Everyone knows how destiny would make it's mark with Princess Grace, but I really neve knew her till I saw this, and I'm so glad I did. I've already bought a few of the DVDs as presents for my close friends and family! It was an inspiring story about a simple girl who became a legend through her beauty and her hard work. Totally recommend it!",1302825600,4,1184,4.220264317180617
4445283,5,B004QGYV8G,Despite being a long time admirer of Grace Kelly I didn't realize how much I didn't know prior to watching this DVD. Some great clips of her from both her movies and from her private life. She was just an incomparable class act and a stunner by any measure -- a combination that's rarely replicated in today's Hollywood. Do yourself a favor and buy this thoroughly enjoyable way to pass 45 minutes!,1302739200,3,398,4.541666666666667
4445284,5,B004QGYV8G,Very good,1409356800,,9,4.0
4445285,4,B004QGYV8G,Would have been more informative if extended 30 minutes to include more insights on her Hollywood days and movie-related relationships.,1399593600,,135,5.8
4445286,4,B004QGYV8G,Well done documentary. Very interesting.  She was a statuesque beauty. This doc preparation for Nicole Kidman Movie..qhich I cant wait to see now !,1393459200,,147,5.125
4445287,5,B004QGYV8G,"Very Interesting. Beautiful, graceful woman who chose to live under the public microscope. To whom much is given, much is required.",1392768000,,131,5.285714285714286
4445288,1,B004QGYV8G,"Typical dumbing down of everything for the presumed unsophisticated audience this TV show / DVD was trying to reach. There is another European persona to Grace Kelly's life once she left Hollywood. Come on producers, show some clips of her interviews in French (and don't dub it, subtitle if you must). Despite her Anglophone accent and her American- style handwriting, she was quite articulate and eloquent in her communication. She uses French as a language of communication when she accompanied Prince Rainier on an official visit to Japan in the very early 1980's.",1384041600,,568,5.118279569892473
4445289,4,B004QGYV8G,I hadn't realized I knew so little about Grace Kelly.  I had believed the media about her death - not realizing she had had a stroke while driving.  That made much more sense than her daughter causing it.,1381104000,,204,4.342105263157895
4445290,3,B004QGYV8G,I am glad I read this book. I learned more about the Grimaldi dynasty than I knew before I read it. I came away feeling there was too much Grimaldi and not enough Grace Kelly. This book stuck me as superficial and that was not enough for me...,1375142400,,243,4.083333333333333
4445291,3,B004QGYV8G,let's just say I had the feeling that there was a lot of water flowing under this bridge that we were not going to hear about because it might ruin a very carefully orchestrated image.  Meh.,1375056000,,190,4.277777777777778
4445292,5,B004QGYV8G,"As a child, Grace Kelly was my idol.  An excellent remembrance of a lady who was beautiful, gracious, kind, and a true family person.",1372204800,,133,4.541666666666667
4445293,5,B004QGYV8G,"Beautiful story of a beautiful lady.  I enjoyed all the footage of Grace from childhood to the end of her life.  A lot of history and magic entwined to make this a ""must see"" for anyone who is interested in this exquisite woman and Princess.",1370390400,,241,4.333333333333333
8438115,5,B004QGYV8G,I had recorded this program when it was first televised. So glad to have it on DVD! Great footage of Grace; a well produced documentary about a complex woman. Any Grace Kelly/Princess Grace fan would appreciate!,1502755200,,211,4.888888888888889

8438124,5,B004QGYV8G,"I only wish this was longer and had more information about Grace Kelly, but it's hard to find too many available film biographies on her.  Nevertheless, it is very good and I do recommend for fans of hers.",1411948800,,205,4.394736842105263
