3867683,5,B0027HOBMC,Hope to see MORE episodes! Keep Up the Good Work Ruby!  Fresh TV not your typical storyline for reality TV.  This show really made me think on how I treat people.  Ruby is so sweet and genuine and to see people treat her like crap for being over weight made me so mad.  People can be so mean..I felt so sorry for her.  I'll never see over weight people the same. Thanks Rudy for the change of heart.,1246492800,18,399,4.064102564102564

8354795,5,B0027HOBMC,"I have struggled with my weight all my life, nothing compared to Ruby but still a struggle. That is why I and so many relate to her. This book is a look at the raw emotion and pain Ruby is going throug to succeed. Ruby tells it like it is and that is what makes this book great. She tells of her triumphs and her days she feels defeated. Ruby is a strong willed, funny, kind , Spirit filled woman who lays it all out there for everyone to share in her journey. Ruby will make it she has the support of many and the love of God on her side. I hope she writes another book on her continuing progress.
