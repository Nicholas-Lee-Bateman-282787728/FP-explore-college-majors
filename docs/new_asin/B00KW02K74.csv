My favorite is ""Team Umizoomi VS. The Shape Bandit. It's a beautiful episode about this talking cat that steals shapes, including Geo's shape belt. Kind of reminds me of Megamind, actually. Anyway. My brother really loves it, and your kids and kids at heart probably will too.",1494374400,,438,4.8533333333333335
