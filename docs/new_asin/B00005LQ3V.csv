7944204,2,B00005LQ3V,"I HAVE OVER 5,000 MOVIES ON VHS & THIS IS THE WORST COPY I'VE EVER SEEN IN A MOVIE. GRAINY, BLANK SPOTS,AUDIO BAD. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE 2* IS THE STORY LINE WAS GOOD, JUST WISH THE VIDEO WAS OF BETTER QUILATY. WOULD NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN NOR THIS MOVIE IN THIS FORMAT.",1374364800,,279,4.0
7944205,5,B00005LQ3V,"This is a movie to watch when you can really concentrate. One of the most cerebral horror films I've encountered (that short list includes such things as The Conversation and In the mouth of madness) and that's high praise indeed.
The legend of the creation of Mary Shelly's _Frankenstein_ is the baseline plot of the movie.  Natasha Richardson is beautiful and fragile as the 19 year old Mary.  Julian Sands is wild and reckless as her husband Percy.  Gabriel Byrne brings a perfect brooding darkness to Lord Byron.  He actually fills the ""mad, bad and dangerous to know"" ideal.  What begins as a lark ends as a horrific love triangle.
See it.  I won't spoil it.  Then three months later see it again.",994809600,,702,4.658536585365853
