7108791,1,B00VTDQW0E,"I really had a hard time watching this. I for a while I couldn't figure out why. I mean the acting sucked, the script sucked but I've sat through worse. Then it hit me on top of the crap I was watching the sound track or the sound in general sucked too. It sounded like they were performing on a stage not talking natural but straining to be heard. Add to that the music made me feel like I was watching a bad episode of ""After school Special"". I threw the hole vibe off. So for the pain of it all instead of two stars I have to drop to one.",1517875200,,541,3.8828828828828827

7108796,4,B00VTDQW0E,"""Above Us Lives Evil"" is a throwback to classic, basic horror stories that just put people in terrifying situations, where they scream, bleed and die. In this case it is at the hands of some monstrous creatures. The story actually begins with the guise of a paranormal or creepy neighbor situation that makes you think the family just picks the wrong neighborhood to move to, but what unfolds is standard foray into some really creative areas of creature feature that reminded me of old school horror like ""C.H.U.D."" or ""The Beast Within"". The acting is pretty decent, with a cohesive cast that give believable performances. The directing and cinematography are superb and offer up some eeriness that rocks.

The special effects are a blend of practical effects, great creature design, and paranormal-esque trickery that combine to give a creepy, chilling nightmare. Visually I found ""Above Us Lives Evil"" to be easy to watch, fun, and entertaining. There is blood, screams, spooky night time horror, and -oh yeah some pretty wicked creatures. The soundtrack isn't really anything spectacular but it does a nice enough job at setting an emotionally macabre atmosphere to the story. The music and sound effects are what you want to hear in a film like this. Really I was impressed at how well thought out and put together the film is for a low budget indie horror.

Overall ""Above Us Lives Evil"" is a cool, simple horror film with some pretty nice creature makeup and carnage. The story is pretty basic and not built up as nicely as it could have been. Some of the characters aren't as well developed as they should have been and some depth to the story surrounding the creatures could have really helped to anchor the horror of the situation. That is the only reason I didn't give this a higher score on IMDb or Amazon. That and the ending. It doesn't really feel complete. It ends mid action, or death. So there is no closure or finality other than some final credits scenes that we get to enjoy along with the rock song that ends the film. I really was wanting to watch the family have to fight through till the bitter end instead of having it suggested to me. Still ""Above Us Lives Evil"" is worth watching!",1433376000,2,2209,4.705426356589148
7108797,4,B00VTDQW0E,"This is one cool flick,Yes,It takes awhile to build ,But, OMGosh then The Creatures.

The family that has to move too much,Is nice enough,Mom is Haut and so is daughter and Dad and son have layers.

The house seems like a good deal to our Much Moving Family and neighbors are nice enough.

The Creatures are really amazing and have alot to do,Once they show up and get to feast on teenagers and the May/December couple and then Wait,I hate spoilers and those who spoil,Get this flick,Bet on Amazon and Hulu plus.",1431302400,,512,4.543478260869565

8711202,3,B00VTDQW0E,"Don't know why some of the reviews claim it was boring, and complained that it was low-budget, but I don't know what movie they saw, but this was anything but boring. Yeah, it is low-budget, like most monster movies of this genre, but it is quite scary and it is good. There were some sequences which were a bit slow, however, they weren't enough to bother me and wow, did this movie deliver.  If you like to watch creepy little, or not so little, creatures running around the neighborhood, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",1518220800,2,523,4.505263157894737
8711203,1,B00VTDQW0E,"Guessing cast and crew have left the higher ratings. Boring, poorly made and poorly acted. Maybe if it were alongside other movies made on a shoestring budget it would pass as acceptable but on here, it was even hard to finish at all.",1518134400,,234,4.465116279069767
8711204,4,B00VTDQW0E,"A good old fashioned haunted house film, the type of movie that hints at something more sinister long before it shows anything. The film looks a little cheap, which may not be intentional. But it serves this story well. There is a great deal of build up. If you enjoy low-budget films, then this is another great one to take a look at.",1517961600,,335,4.333333333333333
8711205,2,B00VTDQW0E,"Sorry...  I can't go higher than 2 stars on this...  ( I attempted to look up the budget, but couldn't find it...  I suspect it was quite low )

So...

Pros - The creatures actually looked pretty cool / For what I believe was low budget, the sound fx & audio was done fairly well for the jump scares

Cons - Just about everything else...
The entire family is basically dysfunctional...  No way do the parents in the movie actually have kids ( let alone even spend time around children ).  Ie, it is blatantly obvious that it's not a real family...
This goes as well for the overall acting in the flick...  Pretty poor all around...  Although some of that could also have to do with being given junky lines...
The audio is all over the place...  Some scenes are whisper quiet while others are maxed out...
Camera work is mediocre at its best...  And quiet bad at its worst...

In any case...  This movie certainly rates in the ""let's see how dumb we can make our characters"" department...  I'm pretty sure they all had 0 IQs even before they got scared...  Both guys and girls suffer from the ""Everyone must fall down when running away"" syndrome...  The boy is completely nonchalant about having monsters chasing him around the house...  The girl is just an imbecile who apparently is about as useful as a toothpick in a gunfight...  The fathers IQ has to be lowest of them all...  Honestly, who yells at his daughter about throwing a party when there is blood and dead bodies everywhere...

And don't even get me started on nit-picky stuff...  for example...  Yellow TransAm clearly had the windows rolled down in scene A...  Scene B ( 5 mins later ) the windows are rolled up...  and yet, nobody has the keys...  neat trick rolling up power windows with no power...  ;)

Other odd side note...  this movie is from 2009???  Based on the cars in the movie, the use of flip cell phones, the lighting in the house, and the audio of the flick, I would have put it at least a decade older than that...  but whatever...

In any case...  the only saving grace of the movie was the creatures...  they did look pretty reasonable...  I just wish they had killed everyone as I was pretty much rooting for all these idiots to die...  ( why can't someone make a horror flick with at least moderately intelligent characters... )",1517875200,2,2314,4.478365384615385
8711206,5,B00VTDQW0E,"ABOVE US LIVES EVIL (aka: THEY CAME FROM THE ATTIC- 2009) starts off w/ a tragic accident, claiming the life of a young boy. The remaining Hooper family members move into a new neighborhood /  home, attempting to get over their traumatic loss. Teen daughter Jennifer (Nicola Elbro), hates the whole ordeal, having been moved away from her boyfriend. The dilapidated state of the house, along w/ the weird neighbors, do nothing to increase Jennifer's confidence in her new abode. Jennifer also blames herself for her brother's death. Parents, Richard and Susan Hooper (Robert L. Duncan and Marina Seretis) are concerned about their surviving son, Ben (Leon Bourikos), who has suffered from various issues since the accident, including his not speaking to anyone. Their first night kicks off w/ a power failure, and a terrifying encounter for Ben. It's obvious that something is in the house. Something strange and possibly malevolent. For his part, Ben tries several times to indicate that there's a big problem. He's either humored or simply ignored. It doesn't help that Richard learns a startling fact about the former occupants, information that could greatly affect his own family's safety, and he tells no one! When Richard and Susan have to go out for the evening, leaving Jennifer to watch Ben, the real horror emerges. Jennifer's idiot boyfriend, Matt (Nathan Dashwood), and -unbeknownst to Matt- his group of drunken, neanderthal friends decide to pay her an unexpected visit, resulting in a night of grisly doom! Low-budget horror / monster films don't get much better than this! The monsters are very well-realized, reminiscent of the cave-dwelling creatures in THE DESCENT. Highly recommended for lovers of such movies...",1517875200,6,1733,5.211469534050179
