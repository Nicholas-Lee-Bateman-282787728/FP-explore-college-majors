There isn't much more I can say except... YAHOO!!!!

We are coming down to the end of the Impel Down Saga although we aren't quite finished. With out giving away any spoiler's for those who wait until the DVD releases (such as I), then you are in for a great ending. With only one VOYAGE left in this season, you will greatly enjoy how this one ends.",1389225600,,383,4.305555555555555
5971515,4,B00F9DQ73W,"One Piece is one of the longest series out there, and for all that I have seen (up to this point in the anime, but I've read the manga up to current) this is the best part of the series. The spectacular action, heart, some comedy, tears (if you've watched the series up to now you will cry in this one). All perfect. Luffy vs. Lucci is one of the all time greatest anime fights, and I'm glad to finally have it on DVD. My only issue is that during Water Seven the shows' pacing got screwed up and many scenes of characters looking at each other and breathing have been added that take away from the show itself, but f you don't read the manga you may not notice. And just because I think this is the best part of One Piece doesn't mean it only goes down hill from here because there is still tons to go. (seriously this isn't eve half way through the series yet).",1388275200,,863,4.112426035502959
5971516,5,B00F9DQ73W,"This Is one of the best arcs in the series (personally my 3rd behind, along park and marine ford).. This voyage has the ending of a good fight with Zoro and kaku, and my favorite luffy vs lucci.. Luffy is the best and totally snapped against lucci giving everything he had.. This is a really good set to buy",1388188800,,307,4.220338983050848

5971518,5,B00F9DQ73W,"The epic conclusion to the Luffy Vs Lucci fight and a farewell to an old ""friend"" ..... What else you want. The only thing I didn't like about the set, is the fact they added the same interview with Brina Palencia from a pervious set.",1386892800,,234,4.222222222222222
5971519,5,B00F9DQ73W,"The episodes contained on this set will leave you on the edge of your seat!

5971520,5,B00F9DQ73W,"When i first started watching this series I was BLOWN away at how funny/serious it was. Filler Arcs are actually ok,even though i'm not a guy to watch much filler i enjoyed more than 1/2 of them. I just can't wait for this next arc to come out. :D its a good arc for 'shadowing' Water 7",1381190400,4,286,4.035087719298246
