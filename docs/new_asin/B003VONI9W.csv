Now the overall coverage is exellent non the less for any armchair or active motorcyclist.
A must for your colection!!",1344816000,,242,4.926829268292683
8406920,2,B003VONI9W,"If you're hoping to see Guy Martin's firey crash, it's NOT on this disc! Just the mention, of the incident (bummer!). Race coverage & production, is of typical quality, of previous TT series releases.",1322092800,,200,4.911764705882353
8406921,5,B003VONI9W,"This video is awesome.  The quality is incredible.  I love the action of the races, and while some of the shots are dizzying, they are also all breathtaking.  The famous crash from this year was not included in the video, so don't worry about that, or don't expect to be able to see it on here if you are curious.  I will probably buy every year that is released, and I hope that they will live up to this quality standard that they set.  This is a beautiful display of pure racing, and I would definitely recommend purchasing it.",1318291200,,530,4.313131313131313
8406922,5,B003VONI9W,"Excellent coverage of all the races. DVD also includes other features with some back ground on the racers and the location.
Great DVD of an excellent racing event.",1296864000,2,163,4.857142857142857
8406923,5,B003VONI9W,"This is a wonderfully entertaining and thrilling summary of the June 2010 Isle of Man races.  It covers the course from many angles, including from the air, and gives a superb sense of what the race looks like and how it feels to ride along the tree- and house-lined course at 160 mph and more.",1291248000,5,294,4.345454545454546
8406924,3,B003VONI9W,"The Blu ray is very nice, the quality is great! I was suprised to see you can't access any disc fetures once the disc is playing. Could it be my player? I don't think so, I have a fairly new JVC player that is great. What I mean by accessing any features while the disc is playing is that you get the ""won't work"" sign if you try and get to the main menu, or use the ""next chapter"" button. Nothing responds on this Blu ray. If you hit ""stop"", it stops alright, it stops and goes back to the beginning of the disc, and you start over. All that works is ""pause"" and ""play"" to stop and start it again. Oh yeah, fast foward works too, but that's it. Quite anoying not to be able to navigate around the disc without totally stoping it and restarting it to get to the main menu. The coverage of the race is fantastic! Great commentary and footage, the best I've ever seen. One more anoying thing is during the race there are ""pop up banners"" with information on them, but they are placed on the lower part of the screen where they block the action, they should have been placed at the TOP of the screen where there is only blue sky and then they wouldn't block the racing action, you find yourself waiting for them to go away so you can continue watching the race.",1285113600,5,1258,4.159836065573771
