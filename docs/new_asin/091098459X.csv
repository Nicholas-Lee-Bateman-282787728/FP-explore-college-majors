7793381,5,091098459X,"This wonderful film is a full-length documentary of the life of St Louis de Montfort who lived from 1673 through 1716. They way this film is shot on location, it is as if we watch his historical journey as he walked through France and performed his Parish Missionary work. The reenactments of the saint's life and words are interspersed with interviews with experts on St. Louis Marie's spirituality. And the art, icons and music of the time period of his life.

This biography emphases what he believed in, 'God Alone'. A story of a strong gentle priest who spent his life without regard for himself serving the poor and sick. And his great dedication to Jesus Christ through Mary. His works still resonate with their truth today. A true saint whose love to do God's work and really only on Him is very evident. Well worth watching.",1166832000,4,833,4.666666666666667
