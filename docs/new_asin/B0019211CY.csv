It was sent in an envelope with some half type bubble wrap and mailed through the postal system. When I got it and opened it up the DVD box itself was damaged. Pieces were broken off. The DVD works fine but the packaging was below standard which is why the container was broken in tranist. I stopped using another vendor for this problem. So now I have to rethink if I will continue using this vendor.",1361664000,,572,4.209090909090909

8271585,4,B0019211CY,"This popular Canadian TV series, ""Royal Canadian Air Farce,"" is a lot like ""Saturday Night Live"" in the United States - the same kind of set-up with short skits (most about 5 minutes), and similar humor. I find the ""Air Farce"" gang to be quite funny, and even though I live in the United States and know only a fair amount about Canada, most of the Air Farce humor is intelligible to me. There are a lot of references on it to things and people in the U.S., and I usually get the gist of the Canadian references too even if I don't know detail about them. Occasionally I'm a bit lost, like one skit that's all about the clean air position of a Canadian politician, and without knowing exactly what his position was, I couldn't fully appreciate the humor of it. But that's rare. And I didn't find much offensive here (which is very subjective I know), but I did NOT like one short skit that involved grinding up one of Star Trek's Tribbles (a primitive animal) in a blender. I don't find animal abuse to be a bit funny, but again, that sort of thing is rare on here so I'm trying not to get bent out of shape about it. Also, although I don't know enough about the series to compare the various Royal Canadian Air Farce DVDs that are available, the cover of FARCEBOOK states that it's all from 2007, including the show's 300th episode. Anyway, this is is quite a funny 2-DVD set.",1233964800,2,1377,4.341085271317829
