2658034,4,B000IJ6VAQ,"As a pilot, and a history buff, I found this account of the Van Nuys airport  very interesting and informative. The photogarpy, content and commentary were first rate. This documentary doesn't have to take a back seat to any other aviation film. I found it very satisfying on a number of different levels.",1168300800,6,305,4.754716981132075
2658035,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"I heartly suggest this title to not only all the pilots out there, but also to everyone in general in order to understand the passion that there is behind the flying art.",1168300800,3,170,4.34375
2658036,5,B000IJ6VAQ,My father has been flying since he was in his 20's. He is now 78. We watched it together and both enjoyed it very much. I think anyone interested in flying would enjoy it as well.,1167350400,2,179,4.0
2658037,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"This DVD is essentially a documentary of KVNY, w/many interesting personal vignettes of people who made careers from aviation (back when you could make a career of aviation).  The story is well told, the production values are excellent.  I have watched this video multiple times and it makes me want to hug my airplane and smile at our local airport manager.

Along w/the history of KVNY is the message that airports are a community and a valuable resource.  No surprise there, but the non-flying public hasn't got the message.  You might want to send a copy to people who complain about living near an airport.  (You know, the people who buy a house and then decide the airport should be closed because they now live in the area).  I doubt it will change any minds, but we just might get lucky.",1167264000,15,795,4.595744680851064
2658038,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"The opening and closing musical scores by Nathan Wang alone are worthy of consideration by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Both pieces are delicious ear candy.",1167004800,3,177,5.103448275862069
2658039,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"There is no more passionate bond between man and machine than of that that exists between pilot and airplane.  This is possibly the only film to ever capture the strong emotions that pilots and aviation enthusiasts feel toward aviation.  The stunning soundtrack and breathtaking cinematography create a synergy that is difficult to describe, but is undeniably captivating!  The story, told only by interviews, and without narration, is about the importance of local airports as told by those who are most familiar.  To those who care about aviation and its future, this film will be an emotional experience.  After watching it, you are likely to have an urge to drive to your local airport to see what is going on there.  This film is a powerful work of art straight from the heart!",1165104000,14,782,4.886363636363637
2658040,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"This is a very interesting movie for anyone interested in flying or learning to fly.  This would be great movie to show to those who wonder why in the heck you would want to fly in a small plane.  The movie also explains the importance of General Aviation airports and the role they play in our national infrastructure.  It has great photography and was very well researched.

To say that this movie is by Sydney Pollack is a bit misleading.  He had a very minor role in being interviewed for a few minutes but he obviously has a big ""star power"" name.  It is really the work of the Director, Brian Terwilliger.  I was fortunate enough to hear him introduce this film at the AOPA convention in Palm Springs.  This is his first film and he really did everything he could to make this happen.  Anyone interested in aviation would find this a great movie!",1163376000,79,852,4.445161290322581
2658041,5,B000IJ6VAQ,If you are a pilot or just someone who is fascinated by aviation this movie is a must see. It explains why I fly better than I can express it myself.  A very interesting story about the evolution of an airport.  It makes you realize just how precious these local GA airports are and how they are disappearing very fast.,1163203200,27,319,4.3
2658072,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"The movie One Six Right will be enjoyed by pilots or enthusiasts. It explodes on the screen, informs and expands our knowledge of the world. Before the world of aviation we could only stay on this earth with the invention of the airplane we can now fly with the birds.
 We see the development of the airplane through the decades and learn the uses of aviation today. I especially enjoyed the vintage plane footage and the historical information related in the film. I enjoyed the interviews with pilots, engineers and others who expressed their love for aviation.
  The film also shows the significance of women pilots like Pancho Barnes, Elinor Smith and Bobbi Trout. These are names that the general public does not know. I am pleased that they are profiled in the film.
  The traveling public only knows the challenges of commercial aviation. General aviation airports are the lifeblood of small towns. Once these  small airports are gone they can never be replaced. The government must not take over the aviation industry.
  The producer and director Brian J. Terwilliger,  has made a unique film that is a joy to watch. The score is by Nathan Wang is fabulous and the director of photography Steven H. Mills make this film come to life.
  General Aviation airports are the are the lifeblood of small cities They have strong economic effect for our world. Government must not take over the aviation industry.
  One Six Right has increased my knowledge and awareness of the importance of airplanes. It informs the public of the unique uses aviation from fire and police protection, and transporting the sick to hospitals. Flying planes is not just a rich mans hobby.

2658119,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"Another great evening of amazement as only a 9 year old child would experience...
Wow! Once again, I cannot recommend it enough. Period.

Aviation, the freedoms, the personal challenges, the quest for bigger and faster and yet, the joys of only a few who will choose to partake in such a lofty fellowship of Human Angels with metal wings.

A bit poetic, but sorry. I had to tell you.

Get it, watch it, get it in Blu-ray no less. You will not regret it.

The ""Romance of flying"" is a bit of a lost leader.  What One Six Right is is the case to keep Van Nuys Airport open - evidently a hard thing to do in California.

2658148,4,B000IJ6VAQ,"OK, this DVD has an ulterior motive. The film does have historical interest, and the visuals and musical score ARE very good - even more so in the ""Extra Features"", which you should NOT miss.

But the real purpose is to generate public awareness of a very real problem.

There are MANY, MANY HUNDREDS of General Aviation airports scattered around the country, serving a very real need. They are vital to our economy. Problem is, urban sprawl is urbanizing areas that were once open countryside - the natural habitat of General Aviation airports. As the property value skyrockets, G.A. airports are being forced out of business, leaving private and commercial small-plane operators with no place to land.

There is a concerted effort going on to save the land used for these airports from developers eager to turn them into shopping malls and housing developments - and the HUGE profits to be made along the way.

This film presents the case very well. The extra bonus comes from GORGEOUS video footage, sometimes of classic planes, and of aviation pioneers from every era, make this a MUST for anyone with even a slight interest in aviation.",1490313600,,1141,4.865979381443299

They consume valuable land and for the most part benefit from subsidies while serving only the rich.

It shows why pilots fly better than any words I could come up with.  Even if you're not a pilot, but like aviation and airplanes, you'll like the gorgeous aircraft and flying sequences.

2658190,2,B000IJ6VAQ,"At the end of the day this is a documentary produced with the objective of spreading the message that General Aviation airports are disappearing across the USA and the need to save them. To inspire the viewer the history of the Van Nuys Airport, where Hollywood and Beverly Hills luminaries keep their private planes, is detailed, as if you'll get interested in aviation if you think aviation might place you proximity of the rich and famous. Old-timers are interviewed in abundance - persons who used to come down, in simpler times, to the airport when they were teenagers and hang around picking up odd jobs polishing private planes for a pennies per hour.  They are interviewed in front what are now their own private, historic, restored, aircraft worth millions, as if you too can expect to own and restore a B-26 bomber, just as you would an old bicycle. These old-timers try to make the case that aviation is a way of life; all you need do is hang around an airport as a kid and sooner or later your dreams will come true. Except these days if one of these freckled-face kids were to try to get on the tarmac without a pass, they would be arrested.

The documentary fails to point out that in the ""old days"" you could buy or rent an airplane on the cheap. As of this writing, $300,000 is needed to get you title to a basic, new private aircraft; much of that cost to pay not for the actual plane but to cover the liability insurance manufacturers are forced to cough up (our society of lawyers sued the private aircraft industry almost into oblivion). So if you can afford a Rolls Royce, well then you can afford you're own plane. Shucks, I know lots of people like that.

Private piloting is becoming, increasingly, the province of the wealthy elite, and the dolts who made and appeared in this film seem to think everybody has a money tree in their back yard.. Not one word was uttered in this film confronting the prohibitive costs of private aviation and what can or should be done about it. Not one word about Hollywood luminaries, or the Pilots Association  setting up foundations to help kids afford to get into aviation. No, this film is just a bunch of happy-talk about a bygone era when aviation was accessible to a freckle-faced kid with a dream.",1471996800,,2263,4.552825552825553

2658200,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"Due to the discussion of the destruction of Meigs Field in Chicago, if you're a pilot, you may become angry.  However, in addition to the sadness, there is also joy.  There's plenty of ""old time"" airport culture and discussion of the romance of flying that pulled many of us into aviation.  The combination of the amazing photography and the musical score may leave your eyes misty on occasion.  If you're an inactive pilot, you'll want to fly.  If you're not a pilot, it will make you want to be one.  If you've never been to California, you'll want to visit.  Be sure to watch the extra features, particularly one about an old leather flying helmet.",1466035200,3,651,4.608695652173913

2658211,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"I can't get through this film without tears of joy running down my face. The finest aviation documentary of all time. The soundtrack by Nathan Wang is marvelous. The music and the videography coalesce into this perfect composition of aerial wonder.
I attended the premiere of this film at Van Nuys in the hanger with most of the airplanes from the film. It stands out as one of the greatest events I've ever attended.
This film pulls on your heartstrings if you truly LOVE flying. It tells a story. A big story, a small story, and great stories from several interesting and amazing individuals.
The formation of the interview questions was so perfect, Terwilliger coaxed a similar tone from each interviewee that meshes with the film so well and makes it so wonderful.
Never have I seen a documentary with such fantastic interviews. It's the stories you want to hear.
And it's not just about Van Nuys or Meigs Field, its about the passion that humans have for flying. Well, some of us anyways. And mostly, it's about the importance of your local airport. Once it's gone, it's gone. It's in all our best interest to keep our airports, fields, and airstrips open.

I could go on and on, but I'll end with this: if you love flying and you haven't seen this film, buy it now and make sure all your flying buddies see it to.

Please support your local general aviation airport.",1465430400,2,1372,4.618852459016393

2658214,4,B000IJ6VAQ,"This movie is part current documentary and part historical documentary. It moves a little slow at times and could stand a bit of editing  but overall is an excellent short movie. One Six Right is named after the main runway of Van Nuys airport and the movie covers the complete history of that key general aviation airport. While this movie would appeal to aviation enthusiasts it is actually aimed at non-aviation people. If you've ever wondered why your local general aviation airport closed, this will answer that question.

Originally I was going to watch this on my phone, but technical difficulties made that impossible.  It did work beautifully on the regular TV.  Fasten your seatbelt and enjoy. ",1456012800,,488,4.7176470588235295

Well put together film that looks at Van Nuys airport, and the rich history that it has had.  I had chills when watching parts of this film, because I love aviation so much, and would hate to see General Aviation in particular go away.

How many videos made 10 years ago could stand up to the current level of image quality? Harrison Ford is on record as saying this is one of the finest aviation films ever made, and it is. As a pilot, airplane owner, and flight instructor, I have an extra copy of the original DVD that I loan to people to help them understand what general aviation and personal flying is about... what it *feels* like. As for the Blu-ray version of this film (which includes all the original extras, plus One Six Left, and some previously-unreleased footage), it really is like seeing it again for the very first time... you'll notice details that you never saw before.",1452729600,3,925,4.612121212121212

It is a classic aviation movie that anyone would admire, even if only for the poetic beauty of the aerial cinematography and the haunting score.  But it's actually a great history lesson on American general aviation, one of my passions, admittedly.  So when I learned it was remastered, I wasn't sure I needed it in my library but bought the BluRay anyway.  WOW - it's like  seeing it again - but for the first time!  I ended up watching every special feature, as well - about 3 hours straight. It no doubt helped we had just replaced our 14-year old flatscreen with a new UltraHD.

2658388,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"I attended the last air show at Van Nuys Airport (due to airport expansion plans) and was drawn to a crowd to see what they were looking at. Brian Terwilliger was there promoting One Six Right shortly after its release, and one of the films special features, ""Flight"", was showing in an endless loop on video screens. People were standing 10 deep to watch it. I was at the back, gradually working my way to the front as others reached maximum satisfaction and moved on. I was mesmerized and could have watched it all day. Only good manners made me move away to give others a chance to watch from the 'front row'. Of course I bought the video and even though I do not fly in anything smaller than a 737, I go back and watch the documentary regularly. The photography, the interviews, the back story, even the music composed specially for the film -- All are outstanding. I have purchased and given 8 additional copies as gifts, and I always get a HUGE thanks. My dad has WWII flying buddies, they say it brought tears to their eyes. I am still buying it because sometimes I loan it out and do not get it back. I've replaced 2 copies for myself so far. You cannot go wrong if you want to give this to anyone with even the slightest interest in flying.

I will echo someone else's post in that this film has little to do with Sydney Pollack other than that he was one of the interviewees. This is purely the work of Brian Terwilliger. And kudos to Brian, by the way, for letting his very compelling subjects do all the talking. There are no 'interviews' per se, just passionate flyers talking about what drives them, then showing it to us in sparkling HD footage. Definitely 2 thumbs up.

A note to those who criticize the film for being too much about Van Nuys Airport. If you read the film's website I believe you will learn that it was MEANT to be a documentary about the history of Van Nuys Airport. That the airport's own history dovetails so well into the story of general aviation in the US just broadens the scope a bit. The title of the film certainly should be a clue to the film's focus on a single airport.",1404432000,7,2115,4.351898734177215

This movie does for anyone that isn't familiar with General Aviation what small aircraft do for young future pilots.  It introduces you to the wonders of what it means to fly, and gives you an idea of how incredibly valuable the General Aviation air fields are to the country.

Author:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-Tales-of-Flight-From-Biplanes-to-Boeings/dp/B00BKEDNMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 Tales of Flight: From Biplanes to Boeings</a>

What is it about flight that captures the imagination? To each individual it may be something different and to define it and concisely frame it with words can be extremely difficult. Thankfully, Brian Terwilliger went a long way to capturing flight's romance when he created the film, ""One Six Right"".

In the world of security check points and sterile terminals, the general sentiments associated with flying are those of impatience and frustration. The magic of flight seems to have been lost on the general populous as it has become merely a mundane means to an end. Bleriot, Lindbergh, Hinkler, Kingsford Smith and Earhart are now relegated to the history books, only occasionally surfacing through the modern media. But for so many, the wonder of flight still exists. However, this wonder is difficult to share with others.

The sensations and emotions elude the vocabulary of most of us and are best defined by experience rather than words. The still camera can capture moments of drama and beauty from the sky, although it is an extremely difficult task to convey all that needs to be said through a single image.

Through the medium of motion pictures, ""One Six Right"" lifts the viewer to the clouds. Through clear, crisp perspectives the beauty of flight is enhanced in all three dimensions and the sense of speed becomes tangible. The sky is now within reach.

The pretext for the film is actually to be found at ground level, in an 8000 foot strip of asphalt named ""One Six Right"". This runway is the gateway to the world's busiest General Aviation airport which boasts over 380,000 aircraft movements per annum, or more than 1,000 per day. And the traffic is as varied as antique biplanes to intercontinental 737s and rescue helicopters.

It was to this backdrop that film-maker and aviation enthusiast Brian Terwilliger learned to fly and witnessed the diversity surrounding him. He had a clear vision of how he could bring the aviation he knew to the viewer. It was not the world of airline travel, but of still mornings aloft, the beauty of the earth below and the freedom of the sky. However, the path to production was far from straightforward as supporters in the early stages were few in numbers.

In fact, Van Nuys Airport originally opposed the plan, perhaps fearing a damaging expose to add further pressure on yet another airport. However, a determined Terwilliger maintained his faith in the project and began clandestinely filming with a bare budget and lenses sneakily peering beyond hangar doors. In time there was enough footage to produce a trailer for the potential film and this was shown to the authorities at Van Nuys with impressive results. From opponents to allies, the operators of Van Nuys Airport availed virtually unlimited access to Terwilliger and his film crew, opening up all manner of opportunities and vantage points. The film that was to become ""One Six Right"" was now ready to roll.

The air-to-air footage must be seen to be appreciated. To amazingly scenic backdrops, pioneering biplanes dawdle through the serene early morning air and a canary yellow Piper Cub wanders along a bush track. The sun glints off the Mustang's highly polished finish as it rolls past the clouds and beyond the camera ship at speed while a Pitts dances vertically upon its smoke trail as only a Pitts can. There are so many aerial sequences that defy words, but there is so much more.

The film also takes in the history of the airport, from its fledgling days through the war years to the present. A blend of past and present images, footage and people allow the viewer to immediately relate to the airport as a living, breathing entity. It brilliantly tells this story without the use of a narrator, allowing a series of interviews with people across the eras to tell their stories. Intertwined are interesting tales typified by the `discovery' of a Van Nuys aerospace factory worker whose modelling career was launched at the airport, but went on to be known as Marilyn Monroe. There are touching moments such as the elderly retired United Airlines Captain who still retains the same helmet and goggles in which he learned to fly at Van Nuys before World War Two. These personal stories provide a unique insight and relate the story of the airfield in a human sense that is nothing less than captivating.

Beneath the beauty, there is also a story of relevance to our industry today. Like all airports around the world, Van Nuys has been subjected to the urban sprawl and the growing discontent of its new neighbors. The continuing plight of airfields across the nation is highlighted as airfields continue to be closed at the rate of one per week in the United States. Sucked into the vacuum of property development, these community assets are lost forever once they are gone.

""One Six Right"" seeks to remind us all of what airports bring to the community in terms of commerce, access and infrastructure. It counters the anti-airport sentiment by highlighting the `positives' generated by general aviation and those who fly to protect people and property. It is a very worthwhile lesson for all of us involved in this wonderful undertaking. These issues are handled tremendously through the film and stand as testimony that beyond the romance of flying there is definitely a heart.

 ""One Six Right' Is a film that can stir emotions in the most resilient aviator's soul. Whether it is through a particular image or the words of an aging aviator as he recalls seeing Lindbergh pass by, this film can get to you through its sheer honesty. There is no pretentiousness in any aspect of this film; it does not need to boast. Underpinned by a musical score that is equally emotive, the viewer is lifted amongst the clouds and each for their own personal reasons. If Brian Terwilliger's goal was to avail the skies to one and all, then he has succeeded brilliantly.

It is a privilege to take to the skies and sometimes we need reminding of the majesty of the sky we venture into. Despite those grand fliers who have gone before, there are those around us today who do not necessarily share our love of this pursuit. ""One Six Right"" brings together this myriad of perspectives in a film of true beauty and serves to share the true romance of flying.

It ends with the plea to get people involved in general aviation and the importance of keeping the small airports alive around the country.

One Six Right features old, black and white photos and footage interspersed with vibrant high definition video, so it's visually striking. There are a large number of interviews with pilots which are surprisingly gender-balanced, which may not be representative of the aviation community as a whole, but sends a great message to young, future pilots. The music is mostly stirring piano and strings, which doesn't grow old nearly as fast as most of the stuff that's aimed at kids. The message (small airports need to be preserved, the Van Nuys airport is especially cool) is worthwhile,  and certainly not objectionable.

Basically,  if you like planes, you'll probably enjoy this one, and anyone connected to the airport will think it's great. If your two or three year old likes planes, you'll love it, since it's very appealing to someone that age, and doesn't wear out its welcome quickly.

Rich men's toys, the glistening corporate jets and multi-million dollar WW II aircraft, is not what the heart of flying is about. Cute children looking longingly through an airport fence does not persuade non-flying residents living next to or under airport noise. Yes, I am biased, but biased in favor of private flying, as I am a licensed pilot myself. I know of and respect many of the people interviewed on camera.

One Six Right is by far the best and most emotionally moving documentary about airplanes and aviation I have ever seen.  It's not technical documentary about why airplanes fly...it's about why we love to fly them, and if you're anything like me, it will make you want to fly them too.

I also don't know how this was shot, film or digital, but my DVD had the worst interlacing I've ever seen on a commercially produced video.

Oh yeah-- they could have sprung for a little more variety in music.  The same piano riff over and over and over and over and over was too much for me.

One of the greatest examples of capturing the pure essence of flight can be found in the film, ""One Six Right"" by Terwilliger Productions. Set at the amazing Van Nuys Airport, the film absorbs the vast diversity of personalities and aviation hardware that constitute such an airfield. Narrated in the words of aviators and set to an emotive soundtrack, the film footage is nothing short of spectacular. From biplanes with beautiful backdrops to passes by glistening Mustangs, this film brings the three dimensions of the sky into the world of one and all; not just those privileged to take to the skies.

Through vision, words and music, ""One Six Right"" reminds us all why the sky is such a special place.

2658477,4,B000IJ6VAQ,"One Six Right tells the history of Van Nuys Airport in California, which is really a microcosm of the overall history of general aviation in America. The photography is beautiful and the flying scenes are inspirational. The many stories from those involved in general aviation and Van Nuys airport, provide a compelling human touch to the journey. The message is clear: we need to preserve these small airports as they provide the infrastructure and community for fostering the early stages of one's aviation career. All pilots, regardless of their level of skill, experience or type of aircraft flown, begin their training at an airport just like Van Nuys. If they disappear, as is happening all over the world as the demands for housing, shopping malls and industrial land take over, so too will our ability to train new pilots.

It should be noted that this is more a story about an airport itself than a story about flying. There are plenty of flying scenes, but the bulk of the story is devoted to the airport and its long and rich history. Watching the early stages of the documentary, particularly the stories about the combination of fear and exhilaration of 1st solos, certainly evoked fond memories of my own experiences learning to fly. However,  I felt that the momentum of these emotions was somewhat lost when the story turned to the history of the airport. Quite a large chunk of the running time is devoted to this story, and I felt it distracted slightly from the excitement I experienced at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps more time could have been devoted to looking in detail at some of the wonderful aircraft that are stored at the airport, or some footage and explanation about actually flying an aircraft. Some of the aircraft were simply beautiful, and it would have been more interesting for me to have known more about them and the people who fly them.",1255392000,,1882,4.787692307692308

This film is as close as you can get to a sense of the flying community these days.,1243036800,,350,4.117647058823529

It's an absolutely brilliantly filmed movie, with enough aerial shots and interesting planes to keep even a non-pilot like me interested. The film goes into the history of the Van Nyus airport as well as the influence of small airports on general aviation; in a lot of ways, this is the advocacy film for small airports and general aviation (as opposed to the commercial airliners.) I would totally recommend this for anyone interested in a well-shot, well-thought-out aviation documentary that just happens to feature some people whose faces you might recognize. :-)",1235779200,,705,4.8347107438016526

2658490,4,B000IJ6VAQ,"An interesting amalgam of pure ""joy of flight"" and anti-urban sprawl polemic.  The sound of a big Merlin-powered prop biting off chunks of air is music to any airplane lover, as is the sight of a classic airplane, be it a little yellow Cub or a ""heavy metal"" Mustang.  One Six Right presents this aspect of aviation well, albeit too briefly.

The music composed for the feature is pleasing, and the producer wisely didn't allow it to detract form the aircraft sounds, a mistake made by too many who try to catch the essence of flight on video.

The polemic portion portrays sprawling cities as often being like matriphagic insects.  It's certainly true that many an airport has been lost to urban sprawl, which ironically stifles the commercial and recreational aspects of general aviation.  The legal principle of coming to the nuisance often gets trampled by the greed of politicians, real estate developers, and unregulated population growth.  While it was not the purpose of this video to examine this phenomenon in detail, I would like to have seen more development of it, and better juxtaposition of the wonder of flight and the ramifications of growth.  It presents one California city, Van Nuys, that manages a symbiosis with its  general aviation airport, and one Illinois city, Chicago, that doesn't.

What this movie does, it does well, but I was left wanting more.  It was a very tasty appetizer, but it left me hungry for the main course.",1229040000,,1451,4.857723577235772

2658492,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"If you've ever dreamed of flying, if you know someone who's a pilot, or if you're a pilot yourself, you MUST see this movie. It's really a love story -- between the pilots and their airplanes, between fathers and their sons (and daughters) who followed their dreams, and between a community and its airport, in this case VNY, Van Nuys Airport in California. The history of the airport parallels that of general aviation in this country, and it is this history that the movie seeks to tell. Although there are some famous names in the credits, they are not the stars -- and refreshingly, Brian Terwilliger treats them with no more (but no less) honor than the other less famous pilots featured in the film.

It is clear that Terwilliger is passionate about his subject -- everything about the film shows a loving admiration for the men and women who lived the history of aviation in this country and in Southern California. The cinematography is simply spectacular, and the sweeping score adds to the breathtaking aerial shots. The film's message is clear from the beginning: general aviation, and general aviation airports, are national treasures we should all work to preserve.

The program was already around a half hour in progress and caught my attention. I found another date where the program was broadcast and recorded it on the DVR. Rather than take up space on a temporary recording medium, it only made sense to own the DVD.

What was really impressive was the cinematography that takes you on a journey of aircraft and flying from angles never seen before.  To sit just off the tail of a DC3 on landing was just wonderful.

2658502,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"This movie was a fabulously shot video history of an airport, the community adoption, and then the community rejection.  It is so sad to see how many businesses, and other local functions like airports, have brought so much to an area and then the people turn on it like a mad dog.  In many cases the business adapts but the people rarely do.

O'Hare airport in Chicago is a prime example bringing incredible jobs, wealth, and opportunity to a city building it into an aviation empire only to see it now beat up daily by the local residents and politicians.  Ironically the politicians even turn on airports gladly throwing away millions of dollars so they can ""look better"" to the voters (i.e., Meigs Field in Chicago).

America has become a land of build it, use it, crap on it, get angry once it leaves, and then ask for a handouts from lost jobs and income.  This video does a good job explaining this mindset and it's sad implications.

Finally, it also shows our admiration of flight, technology, and the people taking the financial and personal risks.  The people still have these admiring feelings but the exposures to these great things are being taken away from us everyday.

An incredible story but sad implications.",1219708800,,1227,4.723004694835681
2658503,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"Whether you're a pilot or not, this is an important work. Airports are the life blood of many small communities. They are precious resources and are not fully appreciated by many. Since the dawn of mankind, we have watched the birds and wanted to fly. Now that we can, we need to guard this wonderful freedom in every way we can. Please go to your local airport and just watch the planes. Take your kids to see the planes fly and infect them with the fever and excitement that flying can bring to us.
Pilots are a special breed, they are friendly, easy to talk to, and can add a whole new dimension to our lives, if we let them. I have been a licensed pilot for over 35 years and it has been an honour to help general aviation succeed. This is a wonderful movie. Enjoy!

Well run and well equipped facilities which support non-commercial flying. Meigs Field, Chicago is also featured to a lesser degree to show what can happen to an outstanding airfield, when power politics gets in the way.

Meigs was on the shore of Lake Michigan with the city as a backdrop. Unfortunately, the current Mayor Daley wanted to turn it into a park and name it after his wife. Preposterous? You don't know Chicago.

Usually, when one closes an airport an X is painted on each end of the runway to show the airport is closed. Mayor Daley used bulldozers to make his X's and through sheer political power closed one of this country's most unique and interesting airports. A true gem.

It is a nostalgic presentation with haunting music and lovely photography, interesting comments from various pioneers and stalwarts of aviation and over and over, the planes. There are interesting sub-features on the DVD and if you go to the website, you will be shown some hidden bonuses.

Even if you have absolutely no interest in flying whatsoever, it's still an enjoyable film. The production values are absolutely stunning, especially when you consider producer Brian Terwilliger had no real filmmaking experience (other than a home video) and he did it simply to capture his love of flying. Add that to the moving music composed specifically for this film, and Terwilliger gives the pros a run for their money.

History buffs would love this film not just for the history of Van Nuys Airport, but also to see archival footage of the surrounding San Fernando Valley before it became one endless row of housing developments and strip malls.

If you have an HD-DVD player, you will definitely want the high definition version. If you don't, you may want to pick one up specifically for this film, especially since prices have fallen now that the format has been basically abandoned.

However, unlike the beautifully produced original, this one is quite a let-down. While the making of One Six Right is interesting in its own right, I'm not sure if it warranted its own companion DVD, at least not in its present form.

While the interviews with Brian Terwilliger and others about the difficulties of making the film were interesting (among them, Los Angeles World Airports which owns VNY did not originally cooperate with the project), I would have liked to have seen more interviews with the pilots seen in the original. Terwilliger himself said the interviews alone consisted of 80-100 hours of raw footage, and this DVD would have been a great opportunity to include interesting parts of these interviews that had to be cut out of the original for brevity's sake.

Three of this DVD's own extras, ""The Joyride"", ""Into the Clouds"", and ""Movie Montage"" are already featured on the HD-DVD version with the added bonus of being in high definition, unlike the companion which is standard definition only. In fact, the extras portion of the HD-DVD version of One Six Right has better and more content than this companion DVD does.

This video is definitely a good look at a piece of aviation history but don't expect your non-enthusiast spouse or friends to be glued to the screen.",1199577600,,499,4.8352941176470585

It really chronicles much more that just an airport, but...well, you really should see it - I can't really explain. You will have goosebumps when you see the amazing footage along with the well composed music. There are interviews, historical pictures, etc... It really helps to explain some of the romance of aviation.",1197417600,,630,4.633928571428571

Heavy use of a Panavision Super Technocrane for beautiful shots on the ground, but the most amazing segments were from a Gyron camera mounted on an A-star helicopter. They got several aerial shots of other aircraft, but the shots of the A-star following aircraft down final to 16R were absolutely stunning. My favorite was the DC3. My jaw dropped. Undoubtedly, this is some of the most incredible aerial video ever taken. To top it off, the original music is beautiful. It's also an excellent story that needs to be told.

It's pretty easy to get gorgeous pictures of airplanes, in my opinion--they're gorgeous machines and they're in the sky, for goodness' sakes--but the filming in this reaches new heights. Not only that, but the movies has tons of human interest too.

When I asked my wife to watch this with me, she asked me what it was about; when I told her it was about a small regional airport in the LA suburbs, somehow she seemed less than totally enthused. By the end of the movie, she had announced her intention to earn her pilot's license. I think the thing that got her was the obvious character of so many of the people interviewed, coupled with the presence of several professional pilots who are women.

This is the kind of thing you show to kids that can start a love affair with aviation, engineering--or even the planet (some incredible scenery on display).",1194480000,,933,4.580838323353293

They are so good that for the first time in my life I am actually wishing I had a high def super size TV!

The interviews where also very interesting especialy for anyone  interested what goes into making a movie.  The funny part is after watching the interviews I found myself wishing I could go back and give the original 4 stars,  Because it helped me to understand a little more of where the director was coming from with ""One Six Right"".

It's a good insight on General Aviation & how important it is to keep & maintain General Aviation.  Just about all of us aviation enthusiasts started out in General Aviation.  The movie is an excellent presentation of aviation in the real world.",1190851200,3,464,5.065789473684211
2658545,3,B000IJ6VAQ,"First let me say that I mean with this review no disrespect towards all the fine men and women who live and work at Van Nuys Airport in California. Nor am I trying to disparage or take anything away from it's place in aviation history. However there are times in this movie that you would almost think that aviation all started from this airport.  True it includes some strong arguments for keeping small airports open, and it  does a touch upon the tragedy of Meigs Field in Chicago, which was bulldozed by the Mayor into non existence.

In the arguments for protecting general aviation airports, and the history of aviation. I would like to have to have seen a little more coverage of some of the other equally famous airports. Such airports as College Park (the oldest continuously operated airport in the world) in Maryland.  College Park is threatened by the Federal Government because it's so close to Washington Dc. Then there are the airports in Ohio, which with North Carolina share the honors as being the birth place of American Aviation.  What about the now gone and continually threatened General Aviation Airports on Long Island in New York?  Many of those airports where the start of aviation firsts which ended in California.  While just as many started in the west and then ended in the east.  Lt. John M Conroy, who in an F86 was the first man to fly from the west coast to the east coast and back on the same day is a glaring example of this.  Yes they mention the flight, but WHICH AIRPORT did he land at?  How about a word or two about the huge EAA show in Oshkosh Wisconsin?  At this annual event there is upwards of 12,000 aircraft of ALL TYPES present at the same time.  Yes I said TWELVE THOUSAND AIRCRAFT!

The truth is there are hundreds of airports scattered across the United States that have histories just as notable as Van Nuys. Yes I can appreciate the need to keep the movie to under 90 min; just as I can also appreciate the understandable bias towards this airport (after all it's a movie about this airport).  But a minor mention of some of these other famous airports by name, a brief description of their contributions, as well as some of the unique threats they face would have made it into a far more interesting and well rounded movie.  Especialy given the amount of time spent discusing General Aviation as a subject.

Having damned the movie for those points I will give the movie top marks for the aerial cinematography, and the flying sequences which are truly breathtaking.  Even then I would have loved to have seen a little more of the spectacular Southern California Landscape, preferably with a lovely airplane in the middle of the scene.  The funny thing is that in the ""Special Features"" section of the video there is a sequence titled ""Flight"" that lasts for several minutes which is nothing but flying, and this is what there should have been more of in the main production.  The beauty we see in this sequence truly does capture the magic of flight.

In the end I am glad I purchased this movie because of my own passion for aviation.  Despite my criticisms it really isn't a bad movie.  My reason for giving it three stars was because of the over emphasis upon Van Nuys Airport within the broad subject of general aviation.

I am adding this comment several days after watching the movie. An excellent companion to the movie is ""One Six Left"".  Which features even more breathtaking aerial footage.  As well as some very interesting interviews with the creators of ""One Six Right"".",1190764800,10,3538,4.613418530351438

2658548,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"What a wonderful movie!

For pilots, there are many times when you will see a scene, nod your head, look at your (perhaps non-pilot) friend/spouse/signficant other and say, yes, this is what I feel when I fly.  This is why I fly.  When one of the pilots in the movie points to his logbook and says, ""This is a love story,"" you know that he speaks for you.

For non-pilots, this movie might help explain the strange behavior that your pilot friend may exhibit from time to time.  Why he looks up in the air every time an airplane flies overhead, staring at it like it's the first time that they have ever seen such a thing.  The movie not only talks about flying, but shows people flying everything from WWII P-51 Mustangs to Piper Cubs.

""One Six Right"" attempts to do many things.  It is, at the same time, a portrayal of the romance of flying, a history of Van Nuys Airport, and an examination of the current sad state of airports.  Personally I would have loved to have seen more flying... but then again, there's ""One Six Left,"" a follow-on DVD which does have more flying scenes in it.

One more thing I have to mention:  Miracle-worker Nathan Wang's incredible musical score.  I have to say that listening to the music and watching the flying brought a few tears to my eyes, softy that I am.  Fortunately, the soundtrack is available on CD.

If you know a pilot or anybody even remotely interested in flight, you have a sure thing in getting ""One Six Right,"" ""One Six Left,"" and the soundtrack CD.

My congratulations to Brian Terwilliger on a great project.  I so enjoyed seeing the ""Making of..."" sequence on ""One Six Left.""  Your perserverance is amazing!",1188950400,4,1664,4.511705685618729

Terwilliger. After driving our motor home to the Annual West Coast Piper Cub Fly in (yep family vacation involving the Cub) I saw bits of the movie and my 19 year son ordered it on our return. I have to say I was so touched by the essence of how Brian captured flying. It is amazing that a young man, age 32, on his first film could teach me a lesson on the ""love of aviation"" to the lay person. This is not a story about an airport as I thought, it is a love story about humans and science. When my five year old son has seen the movie six times this week, I finally sat down with the family and have now seen One Six Right and the companion disc, oh and the soundtrack is now in my car.  Thank you Brian for showing those that ""tolerate"" flying by a spouse, that it is a love affair that they don't have to be jealous of. I might even take flying lessons after 25 years of marriage because of you.  Our Piper L4J Cub has been in the family since 1976 and is now a welcome member because of this film.

Thanks Brian and everyone involved in this movie.

One Six Right takes a different approach, freely admitting that GA is mostly a love affair, fueled by physical attraction and pursued with passionate abandon.

The film is about one airport, which limits its appeal somewhat. And the camera lovingly caresses one too many rich guy toys, but overall it is a well-done film that captures some aspects of flight.

The DC-3 landing scene alone is worth the cost.

It's beautifully shot and is very nicely directed.  From interviews with many pilots in the LA area, the audience gets a great sense of what makes American grass-roots aviation unique.

I found myself thinking this is the best movie I've seen that tries to tell non-flyers why they should care about general aviation policy in the US, but that it also could do better.  It's a small nag, because telling that story is a very hard thing to pull off, and One Six Right does it better than anyone else.

8145814,5,B000IJ6VAQ,"Cant tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. Ditto for 16Left and Living in the age of Airplanes.
If you love Aviation all three are must haves.
16Right (And 16Left) take you on a beautiful journey. One you will love to take many times.
(Living in the age is not just an aviation move, it is a commentary on just how far we, the human race, has come since the advent of the airplane.)
Excited to see whats next...",1518220800,,413,4.175
8145815,1,B000IJ6VAQ,"After reading the glowing reviews, I ordered this movie, thinking it was about pilots flying assorted private airplanes, with views from the cockpit and comments on their planes, and flying into different airports, or at least some great shots of them performing.  IT SUCKED!!!!  HOW IS 90 MINUTES OF OLD GUYS LECTURING ON HOW IMPORTANT VAN NUYS AND OTHER PRIVATE AIRPORTS ARE TO FLYING ROMANTIC?.  I agree with the theme, but how about 5 minutes of lecture on that at then 85 minutes of planes and flying instead of pics of old airports.  God how I would loved some video of the fastest private single and twin props,  P-51's, warbirds,  and private jets and pilots talking about how they fly and handle while in the cockpit.  Instead they would flash a sexy pic or two on the screen a few seconds every now and then, while the lecture droned on.  ""Airplane Repo"" is ten times more exciting and interesting.  If you want a history lesson on Van Nuys airport mixed in with a bunch of still shots of parked planes, and overpaid Hollywood types like Polluck bragging about how they got their pilots licenses, then knock yourself out for 20 bucks.  Hope I can get 5 bucks or so on resale or Sydney at least donated the proceeds to the cause.",1517270400,2,1238,4.5610859728506785
