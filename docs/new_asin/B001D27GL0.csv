3525678,3,B001D27GL0,Purchased this movie because my granddaughter's Mid-School is in the original filming.  She actually saw the main actors during a school day of their filming.  Movie can be rated as a 'campy' film.,1404432000,,197,4.9393939393939394

3525680,5,B001D27GL0,"Indie film - indie special effects - nuff said.  REASON I give it 5 stars is Billy cracks me up with his humor and acting (like he did in Feeeding the Masses) and once again he has a co-comedic partner in crime and they play off each other very well.  Just simply a very fun and Necrotaining film and one to enjoy as, not only does it paint outside the lines, it does grafitti to your brain LOL.  Keep them coming Billy, and I'll keep buying them!",1276041600,,447,4.114942528735632
3525681,3,B001D27GL0,"Necroville (Billy Garberina and Richard Griffin, 2007)

You get what you pay for most of the time, but sometimes you get a little more. Necroville is basement-budget horror comedy, to be sure, but it's basement-budget horror comedy made by two guys who can do the hip-cynical thing without it coming off as either too hip (a la Michael Cera) or too cynical (a la Jon Heder). In other words, it's actually funny some of the time, which is something I've come not to expect from this type of film. In other words, we have a winner!

Plot: Jack (Feeding the Masses' Billy Garberina) and Alex (Seepage!'s Adam Jarmon Brown, who co-wrote the script) are a scouple of slacker buddies in an alternate universe where monsters have pretty much taken over; zombies, werewolves, and vampires have overrun society, and the few humans left are in a constant battle for survival. Jack and Alex, for lack of being able to find a better job (they just got laid off from the town's video store), join up with Zom-B-Gon, a local undead extermination facility run by a constantly-high rastafarian (Kurly Tlapoyawa). As if that's not bad enough, Jack's annoying girlfriend (Brandy Bluejacket) is trying to get him to ditch Alex, who she considers a bad influence, and settle down. What's a zombie exterminator to do?

It's a silly movie that never tries to be anything but a silly movie, and Garberina and Griffin get big points for not trying to make this movie more than it is. It's dumb fun, and if you look at it as dumb fun, it's highly enjoyable. Turn your brain off and have a fun ride. You're not going to go out afterwards and spend hours discussing it, and sometimes that's okay. ***",1260403200,,1673,4.664406779661017
3525682,5,B001D27GL0,"I hate to say this about low-budget indie horror films.....but....I LOVED IT!  Excellent story, strong characters, good music, good effects, quotable dialogue (""Do you want me to bounce into the adult arcade slash peep show business?.....cause that's where I'm headed."") this one is great.  A MUST HAVE!  I can't wait for Necroville 2.",1259452800,,335,5.283018867924528
3525683,5,B001D27GL0,"Necroville is a horror-comedy starring Billy Garberina (Feeding The Masses, Wedding Slashers) and Adam Jarmon Brown as exterminators of the living dead. It's sort of like Clerks combined with Shaun of the Dead. And it's directed by Richard Griffin who also directed Stink of Flesh, another great zombie movie. Yes, Necroville is one kick-butt movie. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of independent movies, zombie movies,or vampire movies, you should find something here to like. I myself found everything to like.",1250726400,,514,5.280487804878049
3525684,3,B001D27GL0,"Necroville is fun enough, but I was kind of disappointed. The two main characters see an ad on television motivating them to join a supernatural extermination agency. The Commercial is voiced over by a Christopher Walken sound alike, and I was kind of dissapointed there was no fakey Christopher Walken character for the two mains to fight zombies with. It's still vaguely a ""what if Randall and Dante from Clerks were on the Monster Squad?"" movie which is okay, but the dialogue isn't as punchy as it could have been.
Most original ending of how to kill a vampire ever. This is a rental, not one to own, but you'll be glad you saw it.",1234310400,2,635,4.530434782608696
3525685,4,B001D27GL0,"I was fortunate enough to have seen this film when it was first released. I have to admit that I was skeptical about a low-budget horror/comic film not being able to carry the weight it should to reach a diverse audience, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The audience ranged from tweens to baby boomers and they all enjoyed it very much. The film has some raw qualities, but the actors have done an exemplary job, showcasing that they are not some high school thespians trying to relive their glory days. Adam Brown has a deft comedic touch with great timing and Billy Garberina has the charm and good looks to make his character very believable. While the special effects may not be Industrial Light and Magic, they certainly were better than I would have guessed for a film with this kind of minimal budget. The pace of the film did not drag at all and it had a campy but fun feel throughout, almost a non-musical Rocky Horror meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer vibe. It is well worth the price and the time to enjoy this entertaining piece of independent film making.",1221782400,4,1071,4.549222797927461

This is far from a good movie but it is quite a bit of fun to watch. And do know that this is a campy, cheesy low budget movie.

Despite the lack of nudity (there is none), only small amounts of blood & gore (for what I am used to), especially in scenes where it should have truly delivered such, I still enjoyed this movie. I wasn't expecting much from this and yet I found it to be fun and I even got a few really good laughs out of it. Plus there's some scenes of enjoyable craziness that happens such as the vampire eating scene, the lawn chair getting plowed by the vehicle with the spin insult note and the piano & free blood scene, for a few examples. You'll have to watch this to see what I mean. It's a goofy movie. Oh and part of the ending is sick, unexpected, unique, goofy and HILARIOUS!!! I lost my breath laughing and my eyes teared up even. The part of the ending I refer to did deliver, it delivered well! It's a 5 star ending! That's all I can say without spoiling.

The two main characters are entertaining to watch and the girl playing the role of the horrible girlfriend does pretty good at playing a character you ""love to hate"". Some have compared the two main characters to the characters in Clerks and I can say it seems that influenced this. Of course don't expect that quality, this is a very low budget type of film but it doesn't have to be on par with Clerks to be enjoyable. It also reminded me a bit of the friendship-working partnership characters in the film The Janitor (the one by TJ Nordaker & Andy Signore). If you have seen that goofy film called The Janitor, expect that quality, that type of movie. The Janitor is a movie I happen to like a whole lot and own two different copies of it.

 Sure this no Cheech & Chong, no Abbot & Costello, and not even on the level of Clerks. And sure this won't win over a lot of people but I think it's a fun time to be had as long as you know what you are getting, don't have big expectations of it and don't mind the kind of film this really is. It's a film I would watch again because as I have said, I had fun and the humor was well enough to give me a more than a few laughs.  If it delivered with the nudity plus if it delivered a lot more blood & gore in the scenes that it should had done so, I'd probably be looking to buy a hard copy after my rental time is over. I may do so anyway at some point if I happen upon a dvd of this at a decent price.",1511568000,,2570,4.256147540983607
