8197741,2,B000QUUTLO,"This dvd was a waste of my money to be honest hehe  it might not be for you, depending on you level of knowledge keeping fish tanks for hobby. Its very 101 beginner basics, if you have never ever had a fishtank, this might be ok for you, if on the other hand you do know, you need to add water to the fishtank before you add the fish, then i'd properbly pass on this on.",1456876800,,370,3.8684210526315788
8197742,5,B000QUUTLO,Perfect. Thank you.,1448236800,,19,5.666666666666667
8197743,4,B000QUUTLO,it was ok but not enough info,1406678400,,29,3.2857142857142856
8197744,3,B000QUUTLO,"it was informative but not detailed enough for a beginner. needs more info. just has the basics, not much problem solving stuff.",1388966400,,128,4.863636363636363
8197745,1,B000QUUTLO,"This video has an awkward narrator, but really we all could get over this if the video's  information was useful. However they only discuss canister filtration, ignoring the more effective sumps or wet dry filtration systems. They also did not discuss live sand as a substrate, only crushed coral with bottled additives. The sad part is, these are only two disappointing examples, there are more. Overall, this video has a narrow range of topics for discussion and the ones they do touch on, they never delve in to deep enough for significant educational use. What they do repeat a painfully large number of times is NOT to get soap or cleaners into your tank... Seriously, if you want to learn about saltwater tanks, just look elsewhere.",1368403200,,738,4.857142857142857
8197746,4,B000QUUTLO,good for someone starting there first fishtank. not just saltwater. i would have liked if it would have gone more in depth about drilled tanks with under tank filter systems,1335916800,,173,4.8
