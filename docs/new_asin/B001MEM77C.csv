The Voice workshop (DVD 5) has 3 practical aims:
1-To lay out the principles behind the physical use of the voice
2-To set the means by which you can realize the demands of a given text
3-To explore the vocal potential and establish an easy rapport with your own voice so that is ready any time you need it
The exercises are for:
Relaxation, resonance, breathing, muscularity.
Andrew Wade is using Shakespearean Text, and he also gives a lot of tips on how to work on the text when reading it for the first time.
This DVD is priceless.
It comes with a workbook.",1336348800,,673,4.435483870967742
