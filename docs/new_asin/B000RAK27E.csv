8199845,1,B000RAK27E,watched once.  Not worth the money.  Wish I had researched the instructor more before purchasing this video. I found it disappointing.,1375747200,,134,5.333333333333333
8199846,5,B000RAK27E,"I bought this without previewing after loving Step Party, and am very happy.  This is a completely different and more intense workout in that it's 45 minutes of straight stepping with a lot of repetitive moves so there's less time for your muscles to recover. (The first time through, my leg got ""rubbery"" at about the half hour mark, even though I regularly do longer step routines.) The moves are easy even the first time if you're at least an intermediate stepper who knows the calls without needing to watch the moves, it's a super fun routine (which is quite a feat given it IS more repetitive), and Katrina is a master at cueing. It's also kind of nice just to mix it up a bit by turning the step a different direction! I really like Katrina's style, as it has an aerobics class feel and she builds off of basic, safe moves.

The core workout is 43 minutes (customizable) and there are two extras on the DVD...a 30min routine, and a 55 step and weights circuit routine, both of which utilize the same core workout moves. So you get a lot for your money!",1346371200,,1059,4.425641025641026
8199847,4,B000RAK27E,"I really enjoyed this workout. It's just challenging enough to keep it interesting without being too hard.
It makes me want to checkout her other exercise dvds.",1260835200,3,160,4.962962962962963
8199848,5,B000RAK27E,"I have been doing step aerobics for several years.  I am 20 years old and in good shape.  The first time I watched this dvd, I gave up half way.  She doesn't explain the moves very well.  However, I watched it again and was able to figure it out.  The routine is great!  It is interesting, exciting, and tough.  I am shopping for more of her videos now!",1253750400,2,353,4.102941176470588
8199849,5,B000RAK27E,I decided to take a chance and buy a workout from an unknown ( in mainstream)instructor. I was pleasantly surprised the workout is very well made and kept my heart rate up the whole time. It is very well cued and have moves that are reminiscent of old school gym style step workouts. I was able to do the workout after just one viewing because the cuing was just that good. I am an intermediate exerciser but I was happy for the three water breaks to review my rate of exertion. I will be purchaasing Turn and Burn today. Give Katina a try,1238457600,8,539,4.242718446601942
