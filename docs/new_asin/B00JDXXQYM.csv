The plot was fairly good to work out early, and then watch dominoes fall.... the ending was well thought out.. . .
Then there was a bit more of an ending.
We've never seen a series produced in Belgium, the scenery beautiful, the language blend was interesting and lovely to listen to : it seemed mostly Dutch with French and German. The hero was the most unlikely-looking hero, who braved it out despite enoromous setbacks, and whose life had changed by the show's conclusion.  This production succeeds as top class entertainment.  Hope others enjoy it as much as we did.",1421625600,3,752,4.813953488372093

6355386,4,B00JDXXQYM,"This is up with some of the best TV series you'll ever see. It's political in nature but reads like a crime thriller/drama.

Here's the scoop. Set in Belgium, a particular bank is broken into but only 66 of their myriad safety deposit boxes are targeted. And nothing with monetary value is stolen. But said boxes belong to people in a secret group known as Salamander. Many are in high office and if the contents of those boxes get out it could bring down the entire country. The country's chief prosecutor puts his best man on the case.

This is a very clever (and I thought original) story. The details are doled out in an orderly fashion and the degree of tension tightens and loosens just as evenly. What also works well is that both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" are victims of a third party, so they can't work together but need to achieve the same end. What also works well is the investigator's, Paul Gerardi played well by Filip Peeters, complicated relationship with his family, friends and colleagues. He's a bull-headed, incorruptible dog with tunnel vision. He will do whatever it takes to solve the case.

What also works well is the low body count. Murder, even from the bad guys' point of view is abhorrent. Were this a U.S. production there would be corpses all over the place. The music score is really good to boot. There is some techno, some scored pieces and some really nice classical-ish solo guitar. There is also a really good bad guy. It takes a long time before his cage gets rattled. He holds a cool calm through most of the proceedings.

On the downside is that there is one huge coincidence that is too hard to swallow. They worked it well but it shouldn't have been there in the first place.

Other than that this is top notch. If you're into Belgium Political/crime thrillers, this should be right up your alley.",1415145600,6,1849,4.54054054054054
6355387,5,B00JDXXQYM,"The two previous reviews (August 1st and September 10th) give a good description of this series.  They give it four stars; I give it five.  Granted, it is not as good as Wallander (what is?), but it is just as good as Spiral, though very different:  because it takes place among the upper classes, the murders are not as gross, and the characters not as scruffy; they also do not have sex while you are watching (I know: sex is supposed to keep viewers interested; but if the plot is any good, it should not be necessary).  As for the coincidence (on disc 4) which helps solve the mystery, it may be improbable in real life, but in a TV series what is wrong with some suspension of disbelief?

For more reviews, go to Amazon.co.uk.  Of the 53 reviews to-date (October 11, 2014),  67% give it five stars, and 20% four stars.  The less favorable reviews are not marked ""verified purchase"" (I don't know if that means anything to you).  These are zone-2 DVDs, so you will need a zone-free or a zone-2 player.  The current price at Amazon.co.uk is 13.40 pounds (under $25, or about $2 per 45-minute episode).  You get four discs, about 565 minutes over 12 episodes.  Each episode is preceded by a summary of what happened before, and ends with a preview of what will happen in the next one (marked: ""next week"").",1412985600,6,1308,4.472573839662447
6355388,4,B00JDXXQYM,"The latest in a line of Euro cop shows, Salamander may not be up to the standard of Wallander, Spiral or The Bridge but it is still a very slick and very watchable piece of TV drama. It is more of a political thriller than the standard cop show. It starts off with a scene we have seen many times before, a group of very professional criminals rob a set of safety deposit boxes, not for the money and jewels., although they take those as well, but for the secret documents contained in them. These are then used by the backer of the thieves to blackmail prominent men in Belgian government, business, law, banking and the military. Government officials want it all hushed up when a honest cop (Chief Inspector Geraldi) comes across the robbery. As the witnesses die off in what appear to be accidents or suicides Geraldi uncovers a shadowy organisation called Salamander to which all the victims belong. He soon finds himself in danger from the victims who want to keep the whole thing quiet.

Two things let it down, first Geraldi solves the mystery only with the most amazing piece of coincidence and I have never seen the streets of Brussels so devoid of traffic . Still it is worth watching particularly when compared to most of the American and British alternatives.

6355389,4,B00JDXXQYM,"'Salamander' is a fast paced series that leaves everyone in the dark, while a police inspector, Paul Gerardi ferrets out the truth detail by detail. We know that a small private bank in Brussels was robbed. The bank, Jonkhere, was robbed by very professional thieves, and we are with them in the first episode as they complete their work. They steal money and other things from only certain marked safety deposit boxes. We learn early on that 66 safe deposit boxes were broken into. CD's and other financial papers were left, but quite incriminating evidence was taken. Why and of what use is this robbery?

This is where the story becomes interesting. Anyone who was an indirect accessory is killed, mowed down in some manner to look like an accident or a suicide. Gerardi is called by an old informant, and Gerardi is the only one who believes that there is a bank robbery of great means that has taken place. Because he believes this, everyone is after Gerardi, and, since we have been by his side, we believe him. We come to believe as does Gerardi that many around him are dirty. The reason is yet to be found.

The good guys and they bad guys want Gerardi. Who will get to him first, and will we learn more? Gerardi is a lovely mess, but he has intelligence and good detecting skills. He knows and understands he is in great danger, but he proceeds. A well written, and acted series.

6355392,5,B00JDXXQYM,I love watching European crime stories with actors I've not seen before.  It's fascinating to listen to other languages and to watch views of other cities and countries.

6355394,4,B00JDXXQYM,"Fresh from the brilliance of the Bridge I and II I was looking for something to replace the Nordic crime slot in my viewing and noticed another foreign import on BBC4.  Okay its not Nordic Noir and it hasn't the obvious darkness of The Killing or the aforementioned Bridge.  Nevertheless, there is definitely something rotten in the state of Belgium and detective Paul Gerardi sets out to find and expose just what it is.  It opens with a cleverly executed bank heist.  The bank is private, solely open to only the most exclusive clientele who keep their dirty dark secrets safe from prying eyes, so they think, in safety deposit boxes deep in the vaults of the Jonkhere bank.

However, only a carefully selected 66 boxes are opened out of the hundreds that line the vault walls.  What is it about this particular set of boxes that interests the burglars?  Gerardi doggedly pursues the clues wherever they may lead and they lead to the highest places in the land; no-ones secrets are safe and murder and mayhem follow.

This is a very well made crime series with excellent production values and acting to match.  For me, though, it doesnt quite meet the exacting standards set by its Nordic counterparts; its neither as tightly plotted nor pacey, but, these caveats aside, thoroughly recommended nonetheless!",1433808000,,1308,4.829596412556054

8650113,4,B00JDXXQYM,"This complicated story begins with a professional, Topkapi-like, burglary of 66 and only 66 safety deposit boxes at a private Belgium bank. Millions of euros of jewels, cash and negotiables are left behind. Furthermore, no publicity of the theft appears. Only when a trusted informant is found dead after telling a grizzled police Inspector of a really big heist, do the police get interested. The Bank counters that it wants to avoid bad publicity yet soon owners of the burgled deposit boxes also start dying off and not naturally. Clearly this is more than just a simple theft. All box owners are members of the country's financial, political, judicial, social and economic elite and soon the Inspector discovers that they are all members of a secret organization called Salamander. Neither the bank nor the victims want the help of the police and they don't want any investigation either. This ""caper crime"" quickly becomes a political thriller. Salamander is an entertaining and generally well-paced, twelve episode series that takes almost twelve hours to make it to its end. Faster paced than similar British political thrillers, it is broadcast in French, Flemish and German languages, with easily readable English subtitles. Brussels and its environs are filmed in a muted palette, unlike the darker and more moody Scandanavian programs or the bright southern European programs like Brunetti or Montalbano; also from MHz. It is engaging and watchable though a bit overlong. Coincidence plays a larger role in the denouement than in many similar series. Production is solid and the acting is fine. There is some very brief nudity and some swearing  but junior high and up have seen/heard this all before. A second series has been made but, as of mid-January, 2016, is not yet available in the U.S.. It was very well received when shown in the U.K. on BBC4 so don't be surprised it if shows up PBS either in this version or remade.  Not as good as Spiral, but then what is, it, nevertheless a strong Euro thriller entry and solidly recommended.",1453507200,2,2051,4.994152046783626
