7993061,3,B00009V7NZ,"I saw it once on TV, then bought myself a copy (since stolen in a burglary so I don't remember many details), I remember ""Pyrokinesis"" having an inexpensive look with regard to budget but also having a good story. Not a cheery story, the lead dies in the end, but a bit of hope even in the end as the girl seems to send a message from beyond the grave as her surviving friend mourns her loss- a lit candle seems to blow itself out.. I intend to buy myself another copy to refresh my memory.",1357257600,,490,4.114583333333333
7993062,5,B00009V7NZ,"Pyrokinesis, the story, music and the filming is great though the special effect is not done well enough. Nevertheless, it's a movie worth watching and archiving.",1163030400,,162,5.269230769230769
7993063,5,B00009V7NZ,"This is THE BESt movie of all time.  One of My favorites along with Love Story (the one with Ryan O'neal, really sad) and Harry Potter (Harry for President =)).",1154476800,,160,4.333333333333333
7993064,4,B00009V7NZ,This movie was awesome. The special effects weren't really well done. But the story made up for it. This story is about a girl with great power. She has spent her life hiding her secret but she soon using her great power for revenge (or what she calls Justice). This movie was very sad but worth watching.,1153699200,,305,4.368421052631579
7993065,4,B00009V7NZ,"One of the very best Japanese sci-fi/horror shockers of recent years, this movie is a spectacular mix of Stephen King's Firestarter and David Cronenberg's Scanners - with plenty of fiery stunts and exploding bonces! The main character is a pretty much a loner; pretty young Japanese girl named Junko Aoki, who has been born with the power to be able to incinerate anyone and anything at will. She shuns her colleagues because she can start fires with the power of thought - pyrokinesis. Taking revenge on the brutal teenage gang who run a snuff film business, and have killed the sister of one of Junko's friends.  Her mother tells her that she has inherited this power from her oppressed forefathers and should avoid others because of her innate rage. But she breaks her isolation when co-worker Tada befriends her. He introduces her to his sister Yukie, and Junko is enthralled by their ready acceptance. But things go haywire when gangsters kidnap Yukie to use her in a snuff movie.

The first half of the film plays a bit like a cop-thriller (such as Se7en) with two detectives tracking the killings of the teenagers, then the burnings that follow. The second half, however, lends itself more to horror-action sequences and could very well be some of the most beautiful footage ever filmed. The creepy moments remind you of the first Ring film, and there's a truly explosive climax that seems to have strayed in from Terminator 2!

All in all, a bit of a classic. This film isn't as original or as fun as the other Tokyo Shock films I've seen recently. The plot is a little conventional and there just aren't much special things going for it, yet very enjoyable.",1124582400,,1666,4.7379310344827585
7993066,5,B00009V7NZ,"Junko is a young woman who is a pyrokinetic; when she becomes agitated or upset, things burn.  Ever since she accidentally set fire to someone as a child she has struggled to keep it under control, distancing herself from others and finding ways to secretly release the energy when she must.  When a co-worker's sister falls victim to a vicious street gang whose leader escapes the law on a technicality, she offers to mete out punishment, since she can do so without leaving evidence.

PYROKINESIS (a.k.a. CROSS-FIRE) begins as a straightforward revenge story but after the first hour becomes much more complicated as the plot takes unexpected turns involving police corruption, an underground vigilante group, and other paranormals -- so if the ""Death-Wish"" angle doesn't intrigue you, rest assured that the movie is more than it initially seems.

With an attractive and talented cast, strong direction and impressive special effects this is a film that could easily compete with any Hollywood action thriller.  As an added bonus, the characters feel genuine as well.  Unlike with most American blockbusters, the human element is not lost.

This is a nice DVD package containing numerous extras, including commentary, an interview with the director, an F/X featurette, and several trailers for this film and other Tokyo Shock releases.",1118361600,2,1337,5.219626168224299
7993067,5,B00009V7NZ,"Junko Aoki is a quiet young woman who keeps herself to herself. She is seemingly aloof from her co-workers where she works who in turn treat her badly and make fun of her because of this.
What they don't know is that Junko's aloofness is born out of a terrible secret she keeps deep inside herself, a secret so frightening, so terrifying it has the ability to kill if Junko is ever roused to anger.
Junko is cursed with the power of pyrokinesis, the ability to start terrible fires at will. This power is hereditary and from childhood she has been warned by her anxious mother never to give into her anger because of what will happen if she does.
However as a defenceless child Junko was forced to kill a boy who tried to attack her and she has never forgotten the terror she felt as she saw the youth explode into flames and die before her eyes.
It is this memory that makes Junko so aloof and distant from her fellow workers,  however she is lonely and when she is befriended by the gentle Mr Tada, a fellow office worker, she lets her defences down for the first time since she was a child, falls in love with him and becomes close to his teenage sister, the lively and loving Yukie.
When Yukie is cruelly murdered by a group of young men making Snuff Films for kicks, Junko's fire born rage is ignited and she reveals to her friend Mr Tada the terrible gift she has harboured within her since birth.
At first Mr Tada is consumed by the need to revenge his younger sister's death but when he sees one of the murderers catch light and the agony and pain such a fiery end causes, he momentarily backs away from Junko, unable to continue with his quest. He is confused and unsure of what he wants in the way of retribution for his beloved sister's death.
Junko is also being doggedly tracked by a sympathetic female Police Officer, Kaori whose sense of humour is wonderfully dry and brittle, especially when unexplained fires flare up along with her male junior colleague who just might have a terrible link to Junko from a past the young woman would rather forget.
Junko though is out for revenge, especially when a stranger gives her tape of Yukie's death and she sets out on a journey which could ultimately lead to both her redemption and destruction.
There are many poignant moments in this movie like when Junko tries to have a family life with a young girl who has similar powers to her own, and her memories of her mother's warnings about the power she possesses within. Some of the last scenes are the most memorable and touching and there is a strange beauty if the violence of fire.
The plot has many twists in it, and some of them you don't expect which makes the movie all the more exciting and watchable.
All the characters are larger than life but are also incredibly subtle and the actresses playing Junko and Kaori steal the show with their strength and vulnerability.
This movie is very reminiscent of Stephen King's book and film Firestarter; this movie however is far superior, in acting, special effects, the musical score and the twists and turns of a complex but thrilling plot.
Some people might be put off by the fact that the film is in Japanese and has subtitles, take it from me, it makes no difference whatsoever to the quality of the film.
This is a brilliant movie, and well worth borrowing from your local library (if they have it) or buying it and sitting down to an excellent evening of fire, blood, tears and brimstone.",1086307200,10,3454,4.482539682539683
