2910473,1,B000TV00KA,Just because a movie is disjointed and weird doesn't mean it's a great nor an artful movie.  It sometimes means the movie is crap. Which is what this movie is.  this was 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.,1212796800,4,216,4.0
2910474,4,B000TV00KA,"Sion Sono is a poetic director; his works often mystify, puzzle and bewilder his audiences. One thing no one can deny about this director is that his films are engaging with their uninhibited and visceral themes whether you like them or not. NORIKO'S DINNER TABLE is the long awaited sequel to Suicide Club (aka. Suicide Circle). I know, most folks are probably dreading a sequel to the cult hit, but Sion Sono delivers, well, not exactly in the way you may expect. ""Noriko's Dinner Table"" is more a companion film to the first film than a solid sequel. Too visceral to be a melodrama, and at the same time too mild to be horror; just what is Sono's intentions with this film. Maybe to deepen its underlying enigma?

A 17-yr. old teenager named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fikiishi) leaves her tiny provincial town and moves to Tokyo to find an internet cult group called Haikyo.com There she meets up with the site's webmaster; a young pretty woman named Kumiko (Tsugumi) and loses herself in the unusual ways this cult group practices, which includes a very unique approach to prostitution and mass suicide. As Noriko grows closer to her new friends, her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka) decides to follow her suit. Now, both sisters must decide if abandoning their old life is worth dying for...

Now, to cut to the chase; is ""Noriko's Dinner Table"" a better film than ""Suicide Club""? Yes and no. Yes, The film is structured in a way as a melodrama would, slowly uncovering its mystery. The film is slow-paced and quite frankly the film really takes its time. Its sense of purpose may equally alienate some viewers as with its predecessor. The events of the film does bring the idea of an organization on a very personal level and it puzzles more than it entertains. However, it is also inferior on some levels; the film looks very constrained by a limited budget and looks a bit too simple when compared to Sono's other film ""Strange Circus"" when it comes to cinematography. The characters are indeed intriguing but it is very difficult to form an attachment to them. They are decently developed but for some reason, their puzzling purpose just didn't sell the idea to me, except maybe for the father. His goal is pretty straight-forward as they come, he wants to find his daughters. (it also does open a plot hole unfortunately)

The film has a very different storyline than ""Suicide Club"". It's timeline is parallel but at the same time it is also takes place after. The fragmented style of the proceedings are interesting with a narration of different points of view from its lead characters; Noriko, Yuka, Noriko, and Tetsuzo. These narratives attempt to explain to a degree just what is occurring but also serves to annoy at times that the film loses a lot of its effect and visual ""punch"". Seasoned watchers will not have any problems following its sequences and dialogue but those unadulterated to this style will no doubt be lost and (perhaps) be a little bored. In some ways this film may be a little more frustrating than Suicide Club, it doesn't really offer any explanations or closure but instead reinforces the mystery behind Sion Sono's first film and opens more questions.

The film is somewhat similar to Sono's ""Strange Circus"". Both films deal with the idea of identity and individualism. Not everything or everyone is as they first seem to be. This film shows us the personal idea of the cult, from Noriko's goal of discovering her own identity and the denial of some truths. The film gives us the idea that all people are actors in a play, that more or less people either succeed or fail in their roles in life. Another theme it explores is the failure of reaching out to your love ones. ""Lions and Sheeps"" are expressed as the philosophy behind the cycle of life.

Now don't get the wrong idea that this film focuses more on philosophy and melodrama. The film does represent a lot of shocking ideas and quite disturbing to the core. Members of the group would fulfill their roles at the cost of their very lives. Noriko was present as an observer when the 54 schoolgirls jumped off the railway as part of her ""training"". Kumiko is the most intriguing character since she remains so cold but at the same time, so capable of expressing emotion in a very subtle way. It was a very interesting sight when she allowed an ""actress"" get stabbed to death for the satisfaction of one reliving a lost opportunity.

In its own way, ""Noriko's Dinner Table"" has all the potential to be a better film than ""Suicide Circle"". It's more personal approach to certain  themes about family and its lasting effect on youngsters, the influence of technology and failure of communication. Hidden from all its motifs and darkness is a very effective portrayal of intense human drama. You might say that this sequel (of sorts) is the heart and soul of Suicide Circle. It is a harder film to comprehend than its predecessor, and despite its faults, it will encourage the viewer to take another look-see.

Don't expect the film to have the same style as ""Suicide Club"" or you will be very disappointed. The film just enlarges the context of the first film; it widens its mythology and reinforces its mystery.

RECOMMENDED! Timidly...[3  + Stars]",1212364800,19,5238,4.739846322722284
2910475,5,B000TV00KA,"Poignant,
Thought provoking,
Genius.
Any one of these words can be used to describe this unforgettable piece of film.
The sequel to ""Suicide Club"", while not even remotely as graphic,
actually manages to outdo it's predecessor in every other regard;
plot, character development, tension, atmosphere, settings, and all around humanity.
This movie does skip around quite a bit more though,
but not so much that it becomes distracting.
And unlike the original, the conclusion of this flick won't leave you scratching your head.
You'll definitely be discussing it, but not out of confusion.
To say the least, Sion Sono is quickly becoming the best horror director to emerge from Japan in recent years.

In this sequel of sorts, we get a closer view into the mysterious Suicide Circle.
We learn more of its convoluted philosophies,
and meet a few more members, specifically Ueno Station 54.
The film follows her history, as well as the members of one particular family,
A tragic-hero of a father, and his 2 runaway daughters,
who inadvertently stumble upon a unique division of the Suicide Club.
 The mass suicides of the last film,
(62 high school girls simultaneously jumping in front of a subway car, etc.)
left a lot of families with holes in their lives.
This division of the club temporarily fills those holes, but for a fee.
Essentially you can rent 1 or multiple family members for a limited time,
and do to them anything you would regularly do to your normal family.
Naturally this leads to some pretty bizarre scenes.

 With each passing film, I get closer and closer to believing that Sion Sono is the premier Japanese horror director to watch. (My apologies to any Miike fans)
Yeah I said it. (Better than Miike!!! .....well except for ""Imprint"" which is a personal favorite)
Suicide Club, Strange Circus, and now this!!!
I can't wait for his next film ""Exte: Hair Extensions"" to release.
As silly as it sounds I know it's going to be that good.
Takashi Miike, eat your heart out!!!

2910476,5,B000TV00KA,"This is the kind of film that will constantly unravel in your mind, long after you see it (its been two years and it's still etched in my brain from one viewing). It has the limitless potentiality of films like Mulholland dr., which are born anew every time you think you've picked something out of it. Sono crafts a multifarious and philosophically charged narrative that is at once complex and delicate, imbuing every component of the film's construction with a responsibility to help buoy its ideas; which incongruously bounce off of Buddhism, Taoism, challenging modern gender/familial roles, the hazard in identity subversion, etc.

In short, NORIKO'S DINNER TABLE is a work of utter confidence and brilliance that charts a course of greater human authenticity and dynamism than its predecessor SUICIDE CLUB. It is also far more ambitious in its scope and concern of modern personhood, urban disilusionment, and the fractured family hierarchy, though each film is comparatively enriched by the other.",1207526400,12,1005,5.24223602484472
2910477,5,B000TV00KA,"This film is possibly better than its predecessor, Suicide Circle, although it is hard to say.

The story starts out when Noriko, a nerdy young girl, leaves home to live with some friends she met on the internet.  Her new friends are mysterious and dangerous.  They run a service where lonely people can ""rent"" a family for a short amount of time.  Noriko joins the business,playing increasingly dangerous parts for strange and bizarre people.  The events in this movie took place before, during, and after the events in Suicide Club, and show some possibilities of what caused the suicides.

This movie explorres the same theories as Suicide Club, those of being connected to oneself and of losing your own identity.  It is, what I saw as a ""darker"" version of Suicide Club, exploring how people get disconnected rather than how they can connect.

overall an amazing movie.",1202860800,2,874,4.8979591836734695

2910479,2,B000TV00KA,"I'm a pretty big fan of Sion Sono, with ""Love Exposure"" (2008), ""Strange Circus"" (2005), and ""Hair Extensions"" (2007) being amongst my personal favorites from his portfolio.  Even his more recent exploitation-style films like ""Cold Fish"" (2010) and ""Guilty of Romance"" (2011) have enough to hold interest, despite their skittish foundations.  ""Noriko's Dinner Table"" (2005) is a dramatic spinoff to the gruesome ""Suicide Club"" (2002).  I read up on the film before seeking it out, so I knew what I was in for in terms of style:  a slow-paced, character driven art-house flick that was very different from its predecessor.  What I got was a boring movie that outstayed its welcome within the opening hour, then dragged mercilessly for another hour-and-a-half.

The plot is bland, the acting is spotty, and the primary psychological elements are unfocused and sloppy.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but this film abuses narration to such an extreme that massive amounts of superfluous verbiage are used when only a few mere images would suffice.  What results is an unbearable series of events that seem to exist for no other reason than to show something during the unending narration.  The dialogue is drawn out yet somehow empty - virtually nothing of interest is said.  Even after 159 minutes of characters constantly yapping (they literally cannot keep their mouths shut for more than 10 seconds at a time), the viewer inexplicably comes away from this movie with almost no additional understanding of the primary themes behind ""Suicide Club"", a film that also suffered from meaningless psychobabble but overpowered its flaws with horrific imagery.

Subsequent to my initial disappointment, I attempted to rewatch ""Noriko's Dinner Table"" on two separate occasions, but simply could not make it past the opening hour.  I'm frankly amazed that I made it the whole way through the first time around.",1335139200,,1915,5.141935483870967

online. She gets involved in the cult group thats involved with a very unique form of prositution called ""family renting"" and mass suicides. Noriko's sister also gets sucked into the group and their father trys to find them. It's a very interesting film about family and finding who you are. It's gets better each time you watch it, though it's long so i always enjoy the first 3 chapters of the film. When it gets to the father in the last chapter, it drage but it's still good. Also, this is not a horror film, it's a drama.",1290470400,5,662,4.253968253968254
2910482,5,B000TV00KA,"Yet another film that doesn't match its box cover.
There is real horror, dread and shock in Noriko's Dinner Table. But it's far more psychological than visceral. I would not call this a ""sequel to Suicide Club,"" and it's not the bloody nightmare its box cover might suggest. There is a fair amount of shocking graphic violence (which might be more shocking if you didn't see Suicide Club and weren't expecting it). But it's much more a disturbing psychological drama about family relations and addresses the sense of 'self' that is a theme in many good Japanese dramas.

I watched Suicide Club before this film, as was recommended (somewhere), but I don't think it's necessary. One film does not explain the other.  It's almost as if the director took some basic elements that are present in Suicide Club (most notably the Web site and the train station) and created something entirely new; a better story with a more lasting impact.

So if you like dark, thought-provoking, psychological dramas that don't shy away from graphic violence and complexities, and that's your idea of horror, this is a great horror movie.  In this instance, however, it seems too constraining to limit this to the horror genre, even though the Japanese do this genre better than anyone.",1286928000,4,1265,4.897196261682243
2910483,4,B000TV00KA,"I think that's the biggest mistake with this movie is that it's advertised as Horror. This a good movie with an interesting story but this isn't a horror movie. That might turn some people off who go into watching it expecting something else.

This is one of those make you think movies not something to scare you. So just be advised.",1282867200,,334,4.475409836065574
2910484,5,B000TV00KA,"To be honest I bought this movie for one reason, the cover had a girl standing next to a wall covered in blood.  Simple as that.  If you are like me and also buying this movie because of the cover, I'd recommended rethinking your choice. This cover is nothing more then a fantastic exploitation cover.

This film is amazing, it is not a horror movie at all, and it's not even that bloody in the strictest sense.  There are only two scenes with blood and if you've seen any Japanese movie you'll know that mean a lot of it.  But the film isn't about the body count as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Royale-Director-s-Cut-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000F4LPJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Royale: Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ichi-the-Killer-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0000CABGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ichi the Killer (Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;it's about the disconnection of family.  And what people will do to have that connection again.

Without giving away one of the oddest parts of the film I'll only say.  The core of the film is about the family.  And what makes the family unit.  Is it the blood connection or emotional bonds between the family members?

This being so, this film is long 2 and half hours long but complete captivating. It feels like an audio book with visuals at some points, with relentless dialogs and images always flashing and happening.  I find myself so absorbed in the scenes and characters and not waiting for the next action scene to come.  Which never really comes anyways, so, luckily I wasn't waiting for it or I'd be one disappointed person.

Either way this film isn't for everyone.  I'm really not sure who it's for, but if you like surrealism, David Lynch,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tetsuo-The-Iron-Man/dp/B000FZEQWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tetsuo: The Iron Man</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suicide-Club-Suicide-Circle/dp/B0000CC885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suicide Club (Suicide Circle)</a>&nbsp;than there's a good chance you'll be interested in this film.  If you do not like the listed above, then I'd say don't watch it.  It will feel like a waste of time.

2910486,5,B000TV00KA,"Watching this film, I found that it was not what I expected.  It's not like Suicide Club; there is much less gore and much more storyline, and the movie wraps itself up without leaving too many important questions unanswered, but its purpose is NOT to explain those left behind by Suicide Club.  It simply takes place before, during, and after the events of Suicide Club.
It's a beautifully profound, thought-provoking movie with many important things to say about society and one's relationships with other humans and our families.  The film is long but memorable and one-of-a-kind.  I've never seen a movie that I could compare to this.

8211075,2,B000TV00KA,"Noriko and later her little sister Yuka run away from their small town and quiet lives to Tokyo after talking with other teens online. Noriko leaves first and tries to become her online alias Mitsuko. She meets Uena Station 54, also known as Kumiko, who leads her into a dark world of family roleplay services. Yuka follows into the very same thing, leaving her family broken. Their mother Taeko kills herself and their father Tetsuzo goes to Tokyo to find them.

Noriko's Dinner Table is a prequel/sequel to Suicide Club that I feel would be a stronger film on its own. The Suicide Club element is weirdly shoe horned and doesn't really fit with this group's mission. There are no characters shared between the two films and beyond the train scene being inserted into the film two times, it doesn't share much beyond the question ""Are you connected to yourself?"" This film is a family drama in its heart. If you come to this film with Suicide Club expectations, you will be disappointed. It has very little violence at all and focuses on each member of the family and their journey.

Noriko leaves her home hoping to find bigger and better things than what her father wants for her. Her demeanor is meek and shy even though she has a fire burning inside her. You would think she finds fame or fortune in Tokyo, but she finds the ability to become whoever she wants. With the family roleplay service, she immerses herself in whatever character she plays, eventually leaving her blank and empty when not acting. Yuka is less able to throw her whole self away, but she also wants something else. She's tired of playing the silly, frivolous little sister and also wants more than small town life. Tetsuzo wants to save his girls and is finally faced with the reality that small towns are not exempt from tragedy. His whole reporter career is based on fluff pieces that try to keep out harsh reality. Taeko unfortunately isn't a fully fleshed out character and seems made to further the polt and create emotional turmoil for Tetsuzo.

The family role play business starts out fairly innocuously. Kumiko doesn't prepare Noriko as they go to a man's apartment dressed in rocker fashions. The man berates them, they threaten to leave, and then have a tearful reunion over dinner. I was expecting much worse and it has the potentional of being very exploitative. Kumiko coaches these young women into completely sloughing off their personalities and sense of self where they would gladly play any role no matter what was required. The most chilling scene of the whole film is when Kumiko follows a friend, who is set to play a hated wife, on a job. Kumiko calmly puts on a soothing song while the friend is beaten and then stabbed to death. When the session is over, the man cheerfully gives her bloodstained money with Kumiko expressing no emotion to the whole event. The whole phenomenon is meant to show how far these women will go to get away from their pain and throw themselves into another role.

Noriko's Dinner Table is an interesting film that doesn't quite fit with Suicide Club. It runs fare too long at nearly three hours and could have easily been cut down an hour at least. Much of the film is character voice overs as they bemoan their lives and repeat the same things over and over in sappy poetic terms. The whole first hour is incredibly dull. The pacing overall is incredibly slow and the plot doesn't truly move forward until over half way through. I love the concepts involved, but the pacing and voiceovers get so old after an hour. It's still worth your time if you find any of this intriguing.",1525305600,,3610,4.653605015673981

Calling this movie a ""horror"" may be a bit of a stretch. It's incredibly unsettling - and sometimes downright disturbing - but not conventional ""horror"" per se (no monsters, no serial killers, no ghosts or hauntings, etc.).

All that to say this movie definitely isn't for everyone. It is, frankly, very slow, and rather on the long side. This worked perfectly for my tastes, but if you're not into the heavy psychological slow-build of it, I imagine the speed of the movie could be off-putting for some people.

It's important to note, by the way, that this movie is a follow-up to ""Suicide Club."" Though ""Suicide Club"" isn't required watching for this, it will certainly enhance your viewing of Norkio to have watched ""Suicide Club"" first.",1471305600,2,999,4.830409356725146

I've seen some complaints that this movie is long and boring at points, and I can understand those complaints. This movie is a deep psychological examination of cult-think, why people join cults, and different problems in Japanese culture from the high suicide rate to the feelings of loneliness many individuals feel in a high-paced, busy society. The film also evaluates the family dynamic in Japan as well, and why some families feel disconnected due to distant, hard-working parents who spend little time with their distant, hard-working children. Pretty great movie.

8211081,5,B000TV00KA,"Before I begin, I have to tell you that I had to watch this movie twice before I really got what it was saying. Yes, twice. Willingly. A movie that lasts two hours and thirty seven minutes. And know what? I loved it the whole way through BOTH TIMES! The second time EVEN MORE.
Therelatively accessiblemovie Suicide Club will probably go down as Shion Sono's most watched and beloved movie. But Noriko's Dinner Table will doubtless be remembered as his masterpiece. And what a masterpiece! It tells the story of a young woman's spiritual journey, and I'm not talking about an Eat, Pray, Love kind of journey. I'm talking about a truly harrowing one, ramped up to Greek tragedy levels, the sort of journey that can lead a king to stab out his own eyes, or a young woman sacrifice her life to bury her brother with honor. The woman in question is Noriko, who eventually becomes Mitsuko, at first just as a nickname, and then as a replacement for her accustomed self. This process of spiritual evolution is guided by one of the most fascinating psychopaths ever to be depicted on film: Kumiko.
Yes, Kumiko is the mastermind, the ""Sun Goddess"" behind the Suicide Club. If you haven't seen the movie Suicide Club, don't be afraid. Norkio's stands full well on its own two feet. But if you did see Suicide Club and liked it, especially if it left you full of questions, you have to see this movie. It embellishes the Suicide Club myth without ruining its mystery. We never see how Kumiko organizes the Club, or how much control she really has for it...in one scene an agent of the Club (who says that a better term than ""Club"" is ""Circle"") interrogates a man using familiar question ""Are you connected to yourself?"" And not once but several times we are taken back to that incredible scene at the beginning of Suicide Club where 54 girls from different schools all meet on a subway platform, walk together to platform's edge, join hands, and jump together in front of an oncoming train.
But other than that what we see is Kumiko's other main activity, her day job as it were. She works in family rental. That is, she and a number of other actors (Kumiko refers to it many times as acting) are connected to lonely people in an operation that seems to run a lot like a high class escort service, except the service that these actors are selling is the simulation of a family. A visit to widowed grandma, or to grandpa on his deathbed; a reunion with an estranged father. One girl, called ""Broken Dam"" is even called on to be stabbed to death by a client who is furious with his real-life spouse. Before she dies, BD lays out her philosophy of victimhood, acting and transcendence in one of the great monologues that are so rare in the cinema of any country.
Yes, this is a great speech kind of movie. I would put it in a category with few films: Citizen Kane, Cline and Julia Go Boating, Hansel and Gretel and Gozu. All of them are deeply connected to fiction, all take place in complex worlds, and all tackle their plots in the sort of fullness which properly belongs not to the craft of film but of novel-length fiction.
Although there is practically no overt symbolism, Noriko's Dinner Table is steeped in Eastern philosophy, particularly Zen. Kumiko, we're told, has no ""memories of her own,"" not because of any sort of emotional trauma or head injury, but because of a Buddhist sort of indifference and contempt to the way that everyone around her hangs on to their identity. She creates a social network called haikyo.com, where she identifies herself as Ueno Station 54, a reference to the transit center personal storage locker in which she claims to have been born (yes, not found; born! In one beautiful scene we actually see her as a fetus suspended in the locker's amniotic bath). On haikyo.com Kumiko meets all sorts of lost souls, particularly adolescent girls, and she knows exactly the way to talk to them, so perfect that she becomes to them a sort of caped crusader (again, we see this image literally). And eventually, whether it be through the Suicide Circle or the family rental business, she spreads her rootlessness, her transcendence of identity. We get a sense of this when Noriko/Mitsuko first arrives in Tokyo to meet Kumiko at Ueno Station in the personal storage locker room. Kumiko is there right on time, and so is her familynot her ""real"" family, but the rental family she's working with today, but Noriko has no idea of this. At one point, while riding in the family minivan, Noriko asks if ""Kumiko"" is a ""real name"". Everyone else just laughs hysterically, and it just goes and goes.
There's so much to say about this movie, but then it would be an article, not an Amazon review. It's not for everyone, just for a lucky few.

Shion Sono casts another jaundiced eye over moe culture (for those unfamiliar, think highly-specialized teen subculture, specifically appealing to girls, that emphasizes cuteness/adorableness) in this loose prequel to Suicide Club, but in Noriko's Dinner Table, rather than looking at an entire subculture, Sono gets uncomfortably personal with his tale of the annihilation of identity.

Plot: Noriko (One Missed Call's Kazue Fukiishi), a disenchanted high school student, becomes obsessed with the Internet message board that the suicide club used in the original film, and befriends Ueno Station 54 (Screwed's Tsugumi), its mysterious operator. Soon, she runs away from home, meeting Ueno Staion 54whose real name is (or is not) Kumikoin the flesh. Kumiko believes that identity is fluidthat you can be, in essence, anyone you want to beand she re-christens Noriko as Mitsuko. The two of them go off on a series of absurd adventures, portraying others at will, and life is fine until Noriko's younger sister Yuka (Snakes and Earrings' Yukito Yoshitaka in her screen debut) follows her, falls under Kumiko's influence, and is similarly rechristened Yoko. Their father Tetsuzo (Audition's Ken Mitsuishi), a disgraced journalist, goes looking for the girls, and discovers Kumiko and the business she operates with Mitsuko and Yoko, and decides to try and get them back, no matter what the cost.

I haven't seen anything close to Sono's complete output (IMDB lists thirty-five titles as I write this in January 2013), but of the Sono films I've seen, this was my favorite; it is the best-paced of the bunch, with the most intriguing storyline, and it's the only one where Sono's trademark absurdity felt like it was reined in in service to the story, rather than overwhelming it. Not to say it's a perfect movieit's still probably half an hour longer than it needs to be, with a couple of subplots that weren't really necessary and a bit too much repetition as Kumiko and Mitsuko set up their businessbut it's all exceptionally well-shot and well-acted, and it's a treat to watch as long as you can handle the outrageous amounts of gore that pop up in a few scenes. This is Sono at his best, wicked and witty at the same time. *** ",1383868800,,2293,5.074270557029178

First, I stumbled on to this on netflix one day while bored.  I read it was a ""sequel/prequel"" to Suicide Club (Circle, makes more sense if you can understand the japanese; i'm close).  I thought, ""great!"". I was in the mood for more of the ""psychologically  disturbing"" type of horror from his first movie, but found this was more of just a well-woven tale that gave a back-drop for Suicide Club/Circle, and imho, let Sion also clear up some loose ends in that movie (after much debate with friends on its ""meaning"", both literally and metaphorical levels).

Overall, there are only a couple ""violent"" or ""bloody"" scenes.  There is a bit of weirdness at the emotional level--you could say emotional ""horror"" in a way, and it's gripping to watch in my opinion.

The movie is also a bit longer than his others that I've seen (Suicide Club/Circle and Strange Circus), but for me it still ended too soon.  In this way, I mean he created compelling characters that i believed and was genuinely interested in seeing how they'd grow, change and end up at the end.  It even leaves some of this open at the end, which I love (leaves me unsettled, wondering).

I highly recommend this whether you've seen Suicide Club or not;  if you have, it'll clarify some of the confusing  elements in that first one (which still is great on its own).  If you haven't, it's still a wonderful movie.  The musical score is brilliant, and makes the movie seem even lighter than it is.  There is a hardness to some characters, and to what happens, an emotional one.

Again, it's well worth the money and time to watch this if you are at all into Asian, or Japanese movies in particular (horror or otherwise).",1363478400,,1821,4.626168224299065
