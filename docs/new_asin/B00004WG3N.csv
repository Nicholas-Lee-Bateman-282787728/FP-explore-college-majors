1363690,4,B00004WG3N,"I loved the entire MKR series, so i just had to see the three OAVs. This of course is the first volume out of three. They continue where the other has left off.  The three volumes are actually like three parters. If you choose to check out this video let me warn you about a few things though. First off, OAV is nothing like the manga or anime. It's a completely different story line. This first volume focues more so on Hikaru and her getting her ovum jewel.
 The three girls: Fuu, Umi, and Hikaru are best friends attending school but none of them are magic knights. The girls are about to graduate from school and part their separate ways. Each are going to go to different high schools in different parts of Japan, so the likelihood of seeing each other again is very slim. Hikaru is majorly distressed by this and decides to make a wish to the cherry blossom fairy(Mokona). This is where all the action begins... The mage Clef shows up in Tokyo, seeking the aide of the three girls to stop the evil Prince Eagle from merging the dying world of Cephiro with Tokyo. (See what i mean when i say different storyline).
  As soon as the movie begins you'll notice major differences when you compare it too the anime series. The animation colors are not as bright and brilliant, they're a bit more subdued. This adds to a darker feel to the OAV. The music also is a lot different then in the series. Don't expect any of those TRA-LA-LA melodies. The girls are also a bit older and more mature acting. Same goes for the voice acting. Their not as squeaky and high pitched. Almost all the characters are in the movie, but their roles and personalities are somewhat changed. Expect to see a return of the childlike bratty Ascot, a much more menancing Ferio, Alycone is still a witch, and Eagle is just plain mean. Oh and hey, Emeraude is alive!
For many of you who expect to see the romance between your favorite couples, sadly there's none of that in any of the 3 volumes.
The plot, itself, is a bit muddled and not as fully developed as in the series. One thing I didn't like was the lack of the hand-to-hand swordplay that i've come to love seeing (no swords, weapons, or magic spells). The girls strictly use their rune gods, which are no longer robotic looking. Their more like animal spirits that interwine with the girls. The video ends leaving you hanging, wondering whether or not Hikaru survives a battle with Alcyone in her rune god. Summing it all up, I, personally, enjoyed this little twist to the MKR series. It was different but i have to say i still prefer the anime.",1016150400,,2579,4.446088794926005
1363691,5,B00004WG3N,"Honestly, I haven't watched my copies of 1,2, or 3 for a while now.  They all seemed to flow into each other, as if there wasn't a pause between episodes.  Perhaps that's what I liked about it!  I don't know about any one else, but the ""what happened last time"" drove me crazy in the episode style.*grin*  The plot in this set reminds me of a ""what if""...what if something that every Ray fan takes in as simple truth(eg: my response to Lantis's appearance: ""Aren't you a little early, fella?"" ) is twisted in some fashion?  How does this affect the plot?  How does this twist affect the characters and the ultimate ending?  Would I be asking crazy questions if the answer wasn't yes? probably not. *grin*  Needless to say, I found it interesting.  It's fun to watch ( I think I bit my nails more than usual during this ""section"" if I may call it) and it takes you on its own plot twists, not too different, but different enough from the first plot line to captivate your attention.  I only hope there is more of this section to come...dare I ask?  *grin*",996624000,,1054,4.381443298969073
1363692,1,B00004WG3N,"Rayeart this is. I have enjoyed both the first and second series of Rayearth and the art is lovely indeed, but this 3 part movie doesn't come close. It looks like the plot was chopped to bits from a 26 part TV series to fit into 3 hours. In fact, it looks like the short version of Escaflowne that is available. Howerver, if there is a longer version of this 3 parter available, I would most definitely get it since this video left far too many questions. I would reccomend anyone thinking about Rayearth for the first time to watch the other two series before even touching this one.",990144000,,584,4.36697247706422
1363693,5,B00004WG3N,"I must say when I first bought this I didn't know exactly what to expect. I had heard this had no connection whatsoever to the TV series. It doesn't. And that is good. Though I love the TV series, I feel it isn't serious enough. This one makes up for that. Many of the characters roles are very different than in the TV series. The main chars are still the Three girls: Fuu, Hikaru, and Umi. The character design in this anime is the best I have ever seen. And I usually do not pay too much attention to that. But I was blown away at how great they looked. The music in this is GREAT! I loved it. The dubbing in this okay. It is definately better than the dubbing for the TV series. ( Which is awful.) The fight scenes in this are very well done. They are a bit more violent than in the TV series too. Again I think that is good. I think it is great that they made a totally different story using the exact same characters from the TV series.",981763200,,942,4.042780748663102
1363694,5,B00004WG3N,"At first when I saw these tapes, I thought they were in the same storyline as Magic Knight Rayearth.  I thought they took place after Magic Knight Rayearth 2...so when I first watched it I was WAY confused.  I mean, Ferio being a bad guy, and Clef being tall...I was kinda lost.  But I watched it again with a new perspective as this was a completely different storyline...they did a great job with the characters and the animation is amazing.  I really love it and I'm trying to get a hold of the third volume as we speak.  I recommend this to anyone in the older Magic Knight Rayearth audience.  It shows the girls fighting passionately without squealy voices and all the cutesy SD.  (And they made Clef really hot! ^_^ heheh)They all look and act older which is cool.  Ja ne minna san and enjoy!",977875200,,798,4.417808219178082
1363695,5,B00004WG3N,I'm a big Rayearth fan and thought that this version of Rayearth was great. The same Characters as the frist serise but diffrent story line. If you like rayearth you have to see this.  In the 2nd part of this 3 part series Umi and Fuu don't know if Hikaru is alvie or dead and are trying to find the gems and Spirt Beasts. I know I said this before it's really good and a defanite must see.,976320000,,390,4.0
1363696,5,B00004WG3N,"As the story of Umi, Hikaru, and Fuu progresses, the plots surrounding each of the girls are explored with more depth. We learn more about what motivates each of the chosen and why they choose to fight they way they do.
 Throughout the second volume, the animation continues to be superb. The dark, earthly tones, and sharp lines mesh extremelley well with the somber mood and haunting background music to give this series an almost gothic feel.
 The artful animation and presentation of characters makes this original to video series one any Rayearth fan, or anime fan for that matter, would love to watch - over and over again.",975110400,,629,4.761467889908257
1363697,5,B00004WG3N,"The main dilemma in the OAV is that the land of Cephiro is slowly but  steadily materializing into the real world of Tokyo because of the powerful  magic of Princess Emeraude, Eagle Vision, and Zagato. This meeting of the  two conflicting dimensions is causing tremendous upheaval, particularly on  Earth, in the form of earthquakes. Guru Clef and Lantis are determined to  stop them by finding the Magic Knights who have the power to prevent the  impending cataclysm.  In a junior high school, Hikaru Shidou was waiting  for her friends under an Oriental cherry tree in the campus garden. It is  rumored that a fairy resides in the tree and that she has the power to  grant wishes. You could just imagine Hikaru's surprise when, after a strong  quake, Mokona falls out of the tree. As Hikaru ran after Mokona (not  realizing that a magical gem called an ""ovum"" has materialized on  the back of her hand), she was followed by her two best friends: Umi  Ryuuzaki and Fuu Hououji.  Suddenly, the three girls were trapped and  transported by a powerful force to Tokyo Tower where they saw, for the  first time, a grown-up Guru Clef. Hikaru, in particular, was being guided  by a mysterious voice who told her that she and her friends could prevent  the destruction of Earth if they could pass the tests so that they could  summon the Mashin Gods.  In the meantime, Guru Clef was waging a losing  battle against the witch Alcyone, who was bent on destroying him and Tokyo  Tower (which is the real world incarnation of the Royal Palace of Cephiro).  Though our heroines went to aid the wounded Guru Clef, they were no match  against Alcyone who was now merged with her cat Mashin. Just as things  seemed hopeless, Hikaru's mysterious benefactor finally revealed himself to  be the red lion Mashin god, Lexus. Before the Palace of Cephiro could  appear in place of Tokyo Tower, Lexus merged with Hikaru and, together,  they temporarily stopped the powerful spell and defeated Alcyone. But it  was not without a price, however. Lexus' energy has been depleted and he  has to return to his dimension to recharge himself until Hikaru learns how  to use her own magic to augment his. Hikaru herself was wounded but Lantis  came and wrapped her up in his cloak.",968803200,3,2251,4.719072164948454
1363698,4,B00004WG3N,"I bought the first tape of this OAV, and was a bit scepticle at first. I  fell in love with MKR and I had no idea how this would change it. It isn't  as bad as I made myself think it would be. Nothing much has been changed.  The girls already know eachother, Clef is tall, Ferio appears to be a bad  guy. The mashins are completely different, but its good for a nice change  for a different story line. All in all, this was a good video.",968371200,2,437,3.9204545454545454
1363699,5,B00004WG3N,This is a pretty good ova for rayearth. It can be kinda of boring but its still good.,1073174400,,85,3.7777777777777777
1363700,2,B00004WG3N,The 3rd part bugs me because someone else draws it! It dosent look so good unless I got a diffrent verstion and I don't think thats the case the voices are the same I think they do sound a little weird but the story line in this one is way diffrent and I wish I never got it because I was hoping for something good but it really made me sad that it was drawn by someone else but its up to you what you get.,1067731200,,406,3.7325581395348837
1363701,5,B00004WG3N,"This dvd is the best I own! The characters are memorable and wonderfully shown. Unlike in 'Magic Knight Rayearth' there is no comedy, so if your looking for something with a laugh track turn back now. But if your looking for a wonderful anime with a story line that will keep you at the edge of your seat, then this is the best to get! I would give this dvd a 10 if possible. Beautiful!",1056672000,,386,4.16
1363702,5,B00004WG3N,"Not being related at all the the TV series, this can be watched without any knowledge of Rayearth previously, and boy, you don't want to miss it.
With awesome action scenes, and WONDERFUL soundtrack, top-notch animation, powerful story, and a very very pleasing DVD presentation, this is one you shouldn't miss.
The story shocked me at how great it was.  I didn't like the TV show as much, but I still enjoyed this, and I think even the casual anime fan, or even non, will enjoy this.
This awesome, 3 part OAV shouldn't be missed.  Check it out!",1054166400,3,545,4.551020408163265
1363703,4,B00004WG3N,"Well, all MK Rayearth things are cool.  This is weird, sorta.  The Manga is still better.
One of the...uh...gwa...""Rune Gods"" (can't remember that Japanese term.) name has been changed.  Hikaru's gaurdian is ""Lexus"" I belive...it's still not the same.
Clef looks better.  Eagel needs mental help.  Lantis is...basically the same.  Zagato is...well...dead.  Ascot is still cute (they changed the color of his outfit. ^-^)  Ferio is more of a pain in the *** sine he fights against them.  Alcyone is...well...the same, in a sense.
My MK Rayearth rankings:
1: MKR Magna (Direct from CLAMP's minds, of course.)
2: MKR TV Season 1 (Yeah...it's BASED on the Manga by CLAMP)
3: Rayearth OVA (Screwed up; twisted revamp of the story.  Still cool.)
4: MKR TV Season 2 (Yet again BASED on the Magna; THEY CHANGED IT TOO MUCH FROM THE MANGA!)",1053648000,,831,4.871428571428571
1363704,3,B00004WG3N,"First of all, the Rayearth OAV/OVA's ARE NOT related to the actual series. This is just a different story with the Rayearth characters, heence the title 'Rayearth' instead of 'Magic Knight Rayearth.'
While MKR, like almost every other anime series, is rated 13+, i would probably rate the OAV's something like for ages 15+, since there is more blood, and the battles are more violent, and overall it's just ""darker"" than the normal anime. Fortunately for most viewers, the amount of blood flow isn't quite enough to make the average human (whether they watch anime or not) feel the urge to regurgitate. (If you're the sort of person who actually enjoys watching highly violent shonen anime, I suggest you take a look at the Rurouni Kenshin OAV's, which are EXTREMELY bloody- and I'm not the only person who thinks that.)
There are quite a few minor kinks changed in the OAV. The three girls know each other and are best friends in the same school. Hikaru is the captain of the gymnastics team, Umi plays tennis, and Fuu is skilled with the piano. Also, Hikaru's machin is Lexus, and I think Rayearth is supposed to be the combined power of the three mashin or something.
The OAV's artwork is first-rate, with lots of detail and more appealing characters, but it was all over in 3 episodes, so everything is kind of rushed... The characters that formerly looked childlike are re-drawn to look older (such as Clef and Emeraude).Also, the mashin stuff was, um, altered a bit.
Overall, it's a very pretty OAV to watch, but it's not something that I enjoyed immensely, probably because I saw it with Chinese subtitles, and I'm very poor with reading Chinese characters. I just didn't think it was anything really special. Of course, others might disagree, so you should obtain numerous opinions before deciding whether or no to buy the Rayearth OAV/OVA.",1053129600,,1848,4.814465408805032
1363705,3,B00004WG3N,"This appears to be one of those re-workings of a popular title like the Revolutionary Girl Utena movie or the various Tenchi's tweaking the story as it goes along. Ascot's in mini-version as he was in the 1st Rayearth & fights against the girls who are not Magic Knights when the story starts. Ferio fights against the girls beside Ascot & Alcyone while Lantis is on neither side--he's fighting to avenge his brother (Yeah, Zagato's dead already.......No!) Eagle & Emeraude are brother & sister wreaking havok on the dimension they've invaded. Mage Clef looks older than ever--closer to Ferio than the boy-mage from the story.
I was so shocked at all the conversions I didn't (couldn't?) pay attention to all the details, but Rayearth is a place, not the mashin so the mashin Rayearth has obviously been renamed, but I forget what. The English dub is scary, although appropriate, I suppose, since good guys are bad guys so I guess we shouldn't expect Ferio & Ascot to sound the same. I didn't see LaFarge, Caldina, or anyone from Rayearth 2 beyond Lantis & Eagle.
In this alternate reality Cephiro was crumbling due to the sins of its people so the high priest was called on to provide the ultimate sacrifice to try to correct things, but Emeraude loved him & cannot acccept what happened so Eagle, using the people of Cephiro who love the Princess, invades the world Hikari, Fuu & Umi live in.
It's CLAMP, so it's easy on the eyes. The Based on bit is the warning it's not the Rayearth we are familiar with from the manga or the 2 series.",1051920000,10,1539,4.62043795620438
1363706,5,B00004WG3N,I love this movie. when i first bought it i thought that it was going to be a prequel or sequel to the MKR series. But its completely different.

7925074,4,B00004WG3N,"Don't get me wrong, I liked the Rayearth ova very much, it just had a lot of stuff in it that left me wondering 'what?' & 'why?'

For instance there were many parts that were completely different from the Magic Knight Rayearth series. In the series, Hikaru, Umi & Fuu went to different schools & met at Tokyo Tower when they were summoned to Cephiro. In this ova special, the girls all of a sudden go to the same school & it shows that they first met each other in school on a rainy day sharing 1 umbrella. And I was surprised that Hikaru did not recognize Makona upon seeing him the first time. And I was certainly not expecting Ferio to join the bad guys' side. And Ascot is apparently back to his child size. And Alcyone is back even though (spoiler) she died at the end of Magic Knight Rayearth 2. And how on Earth is Eagle Princess Emeraude's brother, when it's Ferio who's the brother!? It's just so odd. Also there were a couple name errors. Fuu pronounces her last name wrong, & Umi pronounces he rlast name Ryuzaku, when it's Ryuzaki in the series!

There were also many things I loved about the ova. Despite the odd parts, there's plenty of action, drama & other qualities to make up for it. Also it shows an old thought of ""What would it be like if you were the only one left on Earth?"" Well that's exactly what happened when Hikaru, Umi & Fuu made the wish to stay friends forever under the magic cherry tree. The wish was disastrous, but the girls' friendship had proven to be the strongest kind ever.  Above all, just having this in my anime dvd collection was awesome.
