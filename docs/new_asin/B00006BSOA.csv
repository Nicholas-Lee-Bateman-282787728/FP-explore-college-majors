7967009,5,B00006BSOA,"This is a generally well acted piece about the difficult subject of the treatment of orphaned and homeless children in early industrial revolution era France. Although the events depicted are bleak and depressing, this film is in many ways lighter in tone than similar Dickensian pieces. Robinson Stevenin is a discovery in this film, and his character will charm you.",1412380800,,368,5.15
