5295374,3,B009A8825S,I have seen many of Sinatra's films and this was one that I was told was a must see. Sinatra is OK as a 50 year old action hero. Trevor Howard is pretty cool as the usual tough guy. However the film did not grab me and really will not go on my list of must wee WW2 flicks or Sinatra films.,1439078400,,289,3.6774193548387095

5295416,5,B009A8825S,"Half ""The Great Escape"" and half ""The Train"". Terrific adventure film and I am not a Sinatra fan per se. I just love this post WWII era of action film. By no means is this realism or historical record. It's a fun adventure film.",1369612800,,228,4.204545454545454
5295417,5,B009A8825S,"Mr. Sinatra is at his best here and he does not sing either...the acting, the scenery, heck, the whole movie is a keeper if you are a war buff, a steam powered train buff, an Alpine ride buff. Even better than ""Where Eagles Dare"" with far far fewer disturbing flaws (if any).",1368748800,,275,4.3076923076923075
5295418,5,B009A8825S,"This is one of the Best WWII escape flicks of the 1960's and is loosely based on a true story. Sinatra plays an Army air corp pilot who gets shot down over Italy and ends up in an Italian POW camp that is populated by Mostly Elite British forces (Royal Scottish Fusiliers) and a handful of American GI's. He realizes he is out classed and refuses to take the position of Senior officer. He eventually asserts his authority with mixed results. His inexperience and bad judgement calls have lasting and deadly consequences. The plot is wonderful if improbable but it works because something like this did happen. The acting is first rate and the production values were tremendous. The scenery is fantastic as is the sound track. If you liked The Great Escape I can pretty much guarantee you will like this. By the way the transfer looks awesome on The Blu-Ray. The sound is also very good. There are also some very nice extras on this that shed some interesting light on the movie production,the history of the real event and some interesting things about Sinatra too. Highly recommended.",1368576000,7,1086,4.721052631578948
5295439,4,B009A8825S,This was one of Sinatra's better films and it wears its age quite well. The picture is by now rather dated but overall this is a good oldie and worth a rent or a buy if on sale.,1365638400,,177,3.6842105263157894
5295440,5,B009A8825S,"There are few films that I will watch more than once. This is one of them. Now I must admit I have a bias towards this genre. This film is exciting from start to finish and tells a plausible story. If you are into this genre or like a good action film than this is it. It has heart.
 Re BluRay. I note some people have responded that the transfer is not that good. I would like to know more about this before I would consider buying the BluRay version.",1363392000,2,452,4.022222222222222
5295441,5,B009A8825S,"VON RYAN'S EXPRESS has come and gone many years ago.  The sounds of screeching steel along the rails and the distant sound of the steam engine whistling its way to freedom have long been silent, but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, Jerry Goldsmith's moving score, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche.

I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war.

This is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart. To paraphrase ... I once told you Ryan, if only one gets out, it's a victory. That still brings a tear to my eye.",1363305600,,1176,4.726829268292683
5295442,4,B009A8825S,"I have always loved and owned this movie from Beta, VHS, DVD and now BLU-Ray.  Part of my bias is that I love movies revolving around trains, particularly during war. Another such classic is ""The Train"" starring Burt Lancaster. I digress. This movie should have been as good as it is....it had a 'cast of millions'....lead by Frank Sinatra, Trevor Howard and lots of other 1st class British actors. It revolves around the escape from and Italian POW camp for British soldiers, whose commanding officer dies. An American Airforce Colonel (Sinatra) arrives at the camp on the day of the funeral, and because of rank , assumes command. Conflict between military ideals and histories ensues. The camp is abandoned and they escape, are caught and loaded onto a train by the Germans. They steal it. Buy the movie to see the whole story and the ending. Made a lot of years ago, it has however been transferred to Blu-Ray format seamlessly with DTS 5.1 HD sound. Well worth the up-grade.",1362441600,6,979,4.758823529411765
5295443,5,B009A8825S,This movie is a great action movie set in WORLD WAR II and FRANK SINATRA plays the part well. A MUST SEE,1360195200,,104,3.772727272727273

5295445,5,B009A8825S,VON RYANS EXPRESS BLU-RAY VERY GOOD FILM FRANK SINATRA PLAYED A GOOD PART LOTS OF ACTION AND A STEAMTRAIN CHASE,1356739200,,111,4.6
5295446,3,B009A8825S,"Unfortunately, this Blu-Ray release appears to be an un-restored transfer. The color balance is off in many places (bright yellow-greens and purples in places where it should be white or brown). My guess that there either wasn't a good dup negative, or they just didn't bother to find one.

I gave it 3 stars for the content of this good WWII movie, but the technical rating is no more than 2 stars. It's surprising that with Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard, that Fox didn't bother to do this film right as it should be.",1356652800,8,520,4.531914893617022

5295460,5,B009A8825S,"Set in Italy during World War II, Von Ryan's Express (1965) is pure `escapist' entertainment, as a group of liberated Allied POW's, commandeer a train, and attempt to sneak into Switzerland, before the German army discovers the truth and destroys them.  While reality is stretched quite far, and it takes some time to build momentum, the film is quite exciting and dramatic, features some rather impressive battle scenes, and memorable ending, that reflects both triumph and tragedy.

Frank Sinatra stars as Colonel Joseph Ryan, an American fighter pilot who is shot down and taken to a POW camp, where as the ranking officer, he takes over command of a group of predominantly British prisoners.  Sinatra had just finished another WW II drama, ""None But The Brave (1965)"" a film set on an island in the pacific, which was the only film that Sinatra ever directed.

Ryan's attitude is radically different from the English, as he looks to improve conditions for the men, and takes a dim view of escape.  Seen as a sellout, the American is given the name ""von Ryan"" by Major Eric Fincham (Trevor Howard), the commander of the British contingent.  Things change dramatically when Italy capitulates, and the Italian soldiers guarding the prisoners vanish.  The British soldiers want to kill Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celli,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunderball/dp/B008YKV0WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunderball</a>) the camp commander, but Ryan intercedes and spares his life, and act that will soon have dire consequences.

The prisoners leave the camp, but are soon captured by the German army, and put aboard a train bound for Germany.  In a daring escape, the prisoners kill most of the German soldiers, take over the train, and then attempt to take the train through a series of checkpoints to the Swiss border.  On the journey, there are a number of close calls, tense moments, and a tragic decision by Ryan.

Von Ryan's Express was based on a book of the same name, written by David Westheimer, an American flier who was actually held prisoner in the famous Stalag Luft III, the POW camp featured in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape/dp/B0001GF2EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape</a>&nbsp;(1963).  Westheimer's original screenplay, was revised to create a more action oriented adventure tailored to suit Frank Sinatra's personality.  The film's downbeat ending was something that Sinatra insisted on.

The Bluray contains the same bonus content from the two disc special edition released in 2007.  This includes a commentary track, a featurette on legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith, trailers, TV spots and a still gallery.  Featuring one of Frank Sinatra's stronger performances, Von Ryan's Express is a classic example of 60's moviemaking that takes you on a tense and thrilling ride, and leaves you breathless and stunned at the finish.  The film has a strong international supporting cast that includes Edward Mulhare (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir), Raffaela Cara, Sergio Fantoni, Wolfgang Preis, and Vitto Scotti.",1354320000,2,3136,5.5961945031712474
5295461,5,B009A8825S,This has always been a favorite World War II movie of mine. It was planes & trains and a great cast. It is fast movie & has a more realistic ending.,1354060800,,148,3.806451612903226
5295462,4,B009A8825S,"The late great singer/actor Frank Sinatra had his share of crap movies in the '60s like ""Marriage On the Rocks"", ""Dirty Dingus Magee"" or ""4 For Texas"" but this WWII action film along with ""The Detective"" showed that when the material was right, Frank could deliver a good performance equaling the ones he gave in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Man With The Golden Arm"".  One reason is that it's based on a best selling novel by David Westheimer plus a great supporting cast consisting of the great Trevor Howard, one of my favorite British character actors along with Edward Mulhare and a very young James Brolin, many years before his ""Hotel"" tv success. Of course there is a radical change from the ending of the novel is changed radically in the film version probably due to Sinatra's insistence.  Nevertheless this is a very good suspense filled escape thriller marked by excellent direction by Mark Robson.",1353888000,,912,4.877419354838709
5295463,5,B009A8825S,If you like WWII movies and Sinatra is a tuff guy then you will enjoy this old movie. Sound and color quality is excellent.,1353369600,,123,4.166666666666667
5295464,5,B009A8825S,"In what I believe to be the best World War II film of the Sixties(Yes,even better than the star posturing,The Great Escape)before ""Patton"",Frank Sinatra plays Colonel Joseph Ryan,a very clever,level-minded strategist who after crashing in German-occupied Italy,finds himself the new ranking P.O.W.officer. Ryan is immediately at odds with the fiery,bull-headed Major Fincham(excellently played by Trevor Howard)over the squalor the prisoners live in. The relationship with his fellow P.O.W.s is further strained when he reveals tunnels to his captors for improved living conditions. The role Sinatra plays is a complicated one:a clever officer attempting to negotiate his way through simple,straightforward propositions only to have the cruel characteristics of war and its cold moral debates intervene. Sinatra's character has to change and adapt quite often. This is by far,his best performance since ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" and ""From Here to Eternity"".Even though what really propels this story is the fast-paced action driven by the train of the title,what I ultimately focus the most on are the character-driven strengths of the story. In addition to damn good acting,Ol' Blue Eyes wears his role well with the usual aplomb magnified by his Chairman of the Board persona.",1353369600,,1282,5.579487179487179
5295465,5,B009A8825S,great in Bluray! Just came out in Bluray and is a real classic to own for anyone who likes WWII classics.,1353283200,,105,4.0476190476190474
5295466,5,B009A8825S,"Terrific WWII film directed by the great Mark Robson with Trevor Howard who is fantastic as usual....good action and suspense in a very good war story behind enemy lines....great visuals on the blu-ray--shot on location in Italy--great scenery...well worth the dvd upgrade if you are so inclined.... For fans of WWII films, this is one of the best, even though Frank doesn't sing in this one....oh well....",1353110400,,406,5.074626865671642
5295467,5,B009A8825S,"This flick is a little known suspenseful WW II action movie from the 60's.  I would say it ranks below the two greatest classic WW 2 prisoner of war films, ""The Great Escape""and ""Bridge On The River Kwai"", but  It's still one of the very best of the genre and my absolute favorite film starring Frank Sinatra.  Within a minute after his entrance to the film, you'll forget he was ever a singer and completely accept him as a brash P-38 fighter pilot., ,
The plot moves quickly and the suspense and action don't let up.  I purchased the DVD years ago and the Blu ray is definitely worth the upgrade in picture and audio performance if you have a high def flat screen.  Highly recommended.",1352764800,13,687,4.420634920634921
