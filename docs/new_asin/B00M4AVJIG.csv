6556370,3,B00M4AVJIG,"Gotta say, I liked the first one better.

Once again, it's just a 23 minute episode for $10. Yeah, it does have 90 of special features... but still... It aint that great.

Now, I bought it, because I buy all the DC stuff... but honestly, it aint worth the $10.

Wait till it costs $5.",1413244800,8,284,4.127272727272727
