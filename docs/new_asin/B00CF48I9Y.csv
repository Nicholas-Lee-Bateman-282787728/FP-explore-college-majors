5720945,5,B00CF48I9Y,"For over 6 years I've suffered from sciatic pain in my right leg starting from my hip down to my foot. In the last 8 months it has become debilitating to the point of not being able to walk or stand for more than a few minutes. I've treated with chiropractors and physical therapist with no relief. I finally scheduled back surgery for a herniated disk with a prominent surgeon in Philadelphia. Four weeks after surgery I had no improvement and was still in pain and that's when I found The ""Natural Sciatic Relief"" program. I found there claim that I could be pain free in 7 days hard to believe but with their help I finally identified what was causing my pain ( piraformus syndrome) and started to do the stretches they recommended I was unbelievably 95% pain free in about 5 days and have remained so to this day. They also helped me understand and correct the causes of my pain. I highly recommend this program to any one with sciatic or back pain.",1366848000,50,953,4.420454545454546

5720947,5,B00CF48I9Y,"I had endured intermittent bouts of sciatica that left me completely bed ridden for a few days, until it subsided. I always knew when it was coming as about 4 or 5 days prior, my lower back would begin to be painful, along with leg pain. It would get worse and worse, until it hit the tipping point. My last bout dropped me to the floor in a fetal position for about a half hour, before the pain reduced enough to crawl into bed.
I am a very fit individual, age 48, and in very good health. But this was killing me.
So, I began internet research, and found the Natural Sciatica Relief System.  Honestly, it sounded too simplistic, and too good to be true. However, I was desparate and so I ordered the program.
Within 4 days of doing a variety of the exercises, my back improved dramatically.
That was a year and a half ago. The great thing about this is, whenever I feel that tinge begin, I start the exercises and it heads it off at the pass.
I have not had a single sciatic attack in almost 2 years. This system works. Plain and simple. If you suffer from this do yourself a favor and get it as soon as possible.",1425772800,5,1115,4.186046511627907
5720948,5,B00CF48I9Y,After the first day it brought a some relief. You continue doing the stretches and it helps tremendously and you have to keep it up every day  and it gets better every day. I am doing it twice a day and it would help even more if I did 4 times a day. Not enough time or too lazy. I highly recommend it.,1424563200,9,302,3.7936507936507935

5720950,3,B00CF48I9Y,"Good quality and all that, but the exercises did not help me in the least.  In fact, I felt more pain after a week or more doing them.  I stopped, and my pain slowly went away on its own.  I'm sure, however, that this set of DVDs can and will be useful to others.

The answer to my prayer was the Natural Sciatica Relief System.  After a few months of doing the exercises I am relatively pain free, I sleep better, I am so happy AND, I am back to playing racquetball three times a week and I walk 3 miles daily.  I am in my 70's and look forward to maintaining my current life style for many more years. Thank you, SCIATICA INSTITUTE.  Keep up the great work!",1411516800,20,564,4.554455445544554

5720955,4,B00CF48I9Y,"I like this and it is working for me.  Only  criticism is there is too much talking !  The exercises are difficult (some of them) but even if I can't do them well, they still work!  So far, I'm impressed! Haven't had sciatic pain since I've been doing the exercise.  I would recommend this to others.  Diane B.",1409097600,21,310,4.258620689655173

5720957,5,B00CF48I9Y,"As soon as I received my DVD's, I began the exercises for immediate relief and it really worked.  In just two days I no longer had to use a crutch to get around.  I'm now just five days into the routine and I'm walking with far less pain.  The pain in my hip is manageable to allow me to walk without any drugs.  Yes, it is take it easy, but now I am mobile and will be in great shape in the months to come.  This product will change your life for the better.",1401840000,19,459,3.8404255319148937
5720958,5,B00CF48I9Y,"A further update.  After about six weeks weeks using the program I find it is highly successful for me.  I am now into correcting a muscle imbalance in one of the three categories they describe and already notice some positive change.  For me the exercises are relatively simple and the pain exercises took me about five minutes twice a day and the corrective exercises about 10 minutes once a day.  Have made list so do not have to listen to the instructions which shortens the time period.  I will probably not post further updates unless I find that there is something significant to share.  I have no idea whether the program would work for a large population of those of us with back issues but it certainly has worked for me so far.

This is an update of my earlier review.  I have now been using the system for three weeks.  The first two weeks I used the pain relief program and it did help considerably in easing what remained of the pain I was having.  I decided to try this based on a review where the reviewer could not stand for any period or walk any distance without having to sit down.  That was my case for six weeks.  While the pain was finally easing I do think these exercises helped to eliminate it.  I have now gone to the third disc to address a hip imbalance. Of the three muscle imbalances the discs identify this was only one I appeared to have.  Have just started the series of exercises to address this  and will come back and update further.

Here is my earlier review:

First, I have no relationship to these folks and have numerous Amazon reviews of products.  With something like this I am always uneasy when I do not know who or what is behind a product. And it is not inexpensive.  But if it works!  Their lifetime return guarantee helped me decide to give it a try or at least pay shipping both ways to see if it might be useful.

I am just getting started with it and will be back to revise this after using it for a few weeks and can give more details.  For now I have had a sharp pain in rear and down one leg to ankle with some effects in other leg after taking a fall on ice this winter. Started before but aggravated by the fall.  Has gone on for some 6 weeks and while it is now easing for most of that time  could not stand at kitchen counter or walk my dog usual half mile without sitting down.  Even moved chair into kitchen and bought cane chair to take when walking more than 100 feet.  When sitting or lying down no issue.  Going through the first disc it seems likely my problem is piriformis syndrome.  Have done the exercises for this and also the universal exercises  found a couple of exercises clearly  did affect the muscle that is likely my main problem.  My primary care doctor basically has me on NSAIDs which while helping were not nearly this helpful.  X ray showed no hip issue and various tests run showed no other issues involved. Exercises seemed to make the most sense to try and resolve my issues.

I have not gotten to disc 3 for the maintenance program but will look it over here shortly.  For now while first time through certainly did not give me complete relief it was encouraging enough to keep at it and see.  I have had too many friends going the invasive route of either injections or surgery to go that route without trying all other techniques first.

When I started watching the presenter is sitting in a chair against blank wall and since there was no information on the background of those involved in the Sciatica Institute will say I had my doubts.  But the more I listened and looked at the workbook and based on research I have done through University of Maryland, Mayo etc. the advice seems both consistent and sound.  As do the exercises.  Since my pain had eased considerably before doing the exercises I cannot tell how they would have felt were I in the thros of a major back issue but for now they seem sensible.

I will return and add to this review once I have been doing the exercises on regular basis.  If before then I run into any particular problems will return sooner.  All of us who suffer from these problems are looking for solutions and while I hesitate to do a review before using product for some time thought it might be useful to give my first impressions especially for those who might be considering but, as I was, are uneasy not knowing the credentials behind the product.",1397606400,38,4381,4.371287128712871
5720959,5,B00CF48I9Y,"I bought this set after 3 weeks of extraordinary pain in my hip and leg from the sciatica nerve.  I'm 44 years old, a runner and had never experienced this kind of pain or for that duration.  I was really getting concerned and didn't want to drag myself to bunch of doctors and have MRIs etc, mostly because I felt that it was going to cost of lot of money and time and not yield results.  I have no problem going to doctor when I'm sick or have other ailments that I know are in wheelhouse.

The pain I had would subside for a day or two then come back with a vengeance.  I couldn't ascertain if exercise or a particular type of exercise was aggravating it.  When I received the discs the pain had been a bit better but I was still taking ibuprofen every day.  The first week I was about the same and concerned that the exercises weren't going to work or maybe I was treating the wrong kind of sciatic nerve issue.  The video walks you through figuring out what is causing your pain.  But I continued doing the exercises and the following week was experiencing less shooting pains and now for the past week I haven't taken any ibuprofen.  The nerve still causes a few issues but I'm back running and doing other types of exercise.  I'm very glad that I spent the money on these discs instead of going to several doctors and maybe not getting  to the route cause.

I'm starting the 3rd disc soon and hope to correct the imbalance that causes the pain.  Good luck, I hope this helps.",1394755200,20,1482,4.284172661870503
5720960,4,B00CF48I9Y,"I was desperate and in a lot of pain.  I was able to navigate through the CDs and find a section called ""immediate relief"".  it offered some stretches that did in fact do that.  and I was able to keep up the stretches until my pain finally was reduced more.

it gives a person the feeling of being able to control some of the symptoms and get back into ""living"".  I am glad that I invested in the CDs rather than go to a pain specialist that I had scheduled.

the trick is to keep up the stretch routine and avoid stress.  and you too can probably get your sciatica under control.",1391990400,23,580,4.125
5720961,4,B00CF48I9Y,"I enjoyed looking at the DVD's.  They contain a lot of good information.  In my case, I as scheduled to go to physical rehab.  so I have not tried his exercises.  Was good in helping me understand my back problem.",1376956800,10,213,4.25

5720963,3,B00CF48I9Y,Exercises are one level more severe than what doctor gave me and cause the pain/inflammation to increase instead of improving. I think it is overkill and too pricey by far. I would not recommend this product!,1376265600,18,208,4.805555555555555
5720964,5,B00CF48I9Y,"I am not going to lie and tell you I was not skeptical after running across this product after years of back trouble and now at 64, the leg pain on my right leg so debilitating that I could no longer even walk the length of a shopping mall or stand or sit for any length of time, or most important even or ever ride my horse again. The depression became the next problem. I know that God sent this program. I let it sit in the case for days before I got started as I complained daily and my husband kept asking when are you going to look at it.  I finally did, and after many MRI and CT scans, they found stenosis (mild), arthritis and bulging (mild) but could not explain the leg pain, (just live with it, attitude). Kinda like telling someone with cancer to take an aspirin, unless you have suffered this don't talk to me. I , after thinking it might be my psoas muscle as well as the physical therapist was totally wrong, it was and is my Piriformas muscle and after just two times doing the stretches (scared to death I was going to suffer from this exercise) I was feeling relief. Now it is going on a week ONLY, my husband and I are on vacation, just doing things like driving up the coast (could never do that before this happened), walking along the beach towns, looking in windows, (could never do that) and NOW, today, after this writing, I AM GOING TO GO AND RIDE MY HORSE (FAT HORSE FROM NO EXERCISE). Most of all thank to GOD because HE did not answer my prayer with a quick fix, because I would have never been able to share this with you and help you feel relief again, there really is a life out there now and I am going for it, thank you so much for this DVD.....",1374192000,90,1680,4.137614678899083
5720965,5,B00CF48I9Y,"I love this product. The three DVD's take you first through a diagnosis of your type of sciatica. My chiropracter didn't even know that their were different types and treatment is different. The explanations are so clear and practical that it is easy to figure out your type. There are different stretches according to each type and within three days I was out of pain. I do the universal stretches now to stay pain free.  But even better, they target the real problem which is a muscle imbalance. Again, through very simple steps you find out your particular muscle imbalance and how to correct it. I have just started working on the exercises for my particular muscle imbalance which is a high hip. I have talked about these DVD's to so many people and now, even my chiropracter wants a set.  I would highly recommend these tapes. For $77.00 you will receive the equivalent of hours of therapy and a program to stay pain free for life.",1367798400,41,937,4.604790419161676
8581148,5,B00CF48I9Y,"If you have chronic back pain like my father does, try this video.

8581150,3,B00CF48I9Y,These stretches have given some relief.  I think in time it will be more effective.  My advice start with gentle stretching.,1484265600,2,124,4.857142857142857
8581151,5,B00CF48I9Y,"I am so Happy I found this DVD while online getting info on Back Surgery, that I did not want to do. I have spent thousands with a Chiropractor and I was just getting worse.  I could not walk, sit, or even sleep. I suffered for about a year and a half and I knew I had to do something, It was effecting my whole way of living. I ordered this as my last resort before having to decide on injections or surgery.  I received it two weeks ago and for about 15 minutes of my time in the morning. I am just about Pain Free, I can't believe it! I am back to taking walks and sleeping all night. This DVD was the best thing I ever spent money on.  Thank you so much for making it available.",1446681600,,682,3.8920863309352516
8581152,3,B00CF48I9Y,I found the speaker was very long winded.  Two hours to go through 2 of the discs is too long. It would have been better to have the exercises in written format.  I can't remember each and every exercise.  Getting up and down multiple times is hard for me.  It would have been better to have all floor exercise grouped together.  The DVD format is too old for some computers.  It would have been better to download to my Ipad.  It is too cumbersome so search though the DVD for the specific exercise.  I agree the methods and exercises are very thorough and will probably help if I stick with them.  I tried to download to my Ipad so can view the exercises when I am on the floor but was only able to download DVD 2.  It's easier to view things on the floor from the IPAD.  I had to down load extra software to save to IPAD so the whole thing has been an expensive investment compared to other options.  It's too bad the package is so cumbersome because there is a lot of good material here that could help a lot of people. You need to find a professional editor.,1444435200,6,1063,4.182266009852217
8581153,5,B00CF48I9Y,"Typical story: sudden, intense sciatica pain.  Doctor's, Physical Therapist: very little help.  Inversion table purchase: very little help. The advertisement for DVD came as an ad pop up; figured it probably would not work but as it was approximately the same price as a Therapist visit, purchased anyway.  If you do any research on the vendor you find that he has another DVD program on range shooting so buyer certainly can beware.

Total surprise.  For whatever reason the program worked for me.  In a little less than two weeks I was essentially pain free and able to resume normal activities; albeit very carefully.  Continue to follow the program and in another week will begin the preventive exercises.  At this point I would say that exceeded all expectations.",1443830400,4,768,4.9921259842519685

Was going to chiropractor two times a week. He was not helping me at all. I decided to go on internet and search. Low and behold, this came up. Thank God!  I never knew there were so many conditions caused by this nerve. You really need to know what you are dealing with. I was skeptical to buy these cd's at first. The pain was so bad I did not care. The best purchase ever!  Within one week, I was feeling relief. Could not believe it was true. Continued the program and was extremely satisfied. I had Piraformis Syndrome. The cd's are spot on for finding your particular issue. I would recommend this program for anyone dealing with lower back pain and sciatica issues.",1443571200,3,812,4.503401360544218
