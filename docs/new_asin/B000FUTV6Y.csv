8127006,3,B000FUTV6Y,"This is the Japanese version of D.E.B.S. It is cheese filled. It spoofs the Okinawa independence movement. Yuki (Megumi Shji) was born during a riot by a woman with a ball under her dress. She enters the Orion Dancer Academy where she is chosen, along with three other dancers to be assassins/spies.

They must learn to dodge bullets and to choreograph their moves. Bad guys include a man in a Tyvek suit  with respirator  armed with a CO2 extinguisher and a frogman with a duck on his head. The dancers' weapons include Ninja stars and a fake boob filled with gas.

The film had me laughing in a few spots. In one scene as the girls run away, one of this tough assassins is failing her arms about in a very girly fashion. While the film doesn't mention Okinawa by name, it is apparent the southern Kingdom with numerous US military bases is said island. The film would certainly have more meaning in Japan as they make fun of their neighbors to the south, perhaps while Okinawa sees it differently. Sort of like all those popular TV shows of the 60's that showed southerners in a bad light, but southerners loved.

If you are a 5 star fan of D.E.B.S., you might find 3 star entertainment in this film.",1398384000,,1202,4.470319634703197
8127007,1,B000FUTV6Y,"I read the synopsis, and a few reviews, so I took a chance and got this movie. I didn't know the movie was so political when I had gotten it. Surprisingly, the politics were the thing that bothered me the least. The movie was very low budget, the acting was terrible and even the fight scenes were painful to watch. The plot was far-fetched but ok, it just wasn't executed good. The girls were the worst spies ever. It was hard getting through the entire movie just once. I'll never watch it again.",1360627200,,498,4.365591397849462
8127008,4,B000FUTV6Y,"Like I put down in the title field, Samurai Chicks is ""...a fine low-budget indie import for those whose tastes lie outside of the American mainstream."" Like other Japanese, Korean, and Thai films, especially with titles such as Oldboy, Battle Royale, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Nieghbor No. 13, Ichi the Killer, Machine Girl, Toyoko Gore Police, 13: Game of Death, and so on. If you dig such films, this one will be right up your alley, as they say. It is definitey a low-budget indie foreign film, but it is also an amusing, interesting, exciting, strange, and cool piece of film. Four girls at a Dance School are chosen to advance to the next phase, which consists of them becoming teenage assassins of the rebellion, fighting the establishment to gain independence for their little group of insurgents (The Kingdom), using a peculiar kung fu based on dance moves, throwing stars and knives, sword play, and doing what they were trained to do. Overall, it's a great move. And I hope to find many more like it.",1257379200,3,1013,4.761363636363637
