4006347,4,B002WAEOS0,"I started playing tennis without any basic knowledge, I don't know how to grip the racket for different strokes like forehand, backhand, volly etc... but thanks to tennis mantra DVD, his method of teaching is very simple and easy to follow. I have really improved my game. Now I feel pretty comfortable on court.",1258934400,,312,4.796296296296297
4006348,5,B002WAEOS0,"I've been with my trainer for several years.  Some of the techniques that he tried to teach were just frustrating.  I wanted to learn, I just a had a problem with his style.  From the second that I started using TennisMantra, things made sense.  The videos are easy to understand and follow.  Best of all I can view a segment over and over again until I get it.  I've already noticed a marked improvement on the court.  Thanks!!!",1258934400,6,429,4.423076923076923
4006349,5,B002WAEOS0,"I purchased DVD a week ago and I am very satisfied with DVD, whole presentation and details are very helpful and good illustrated.",1417996800,4,130,4.695652173913044
4006350,4,B002WAEOS0,I bought the video because I coach middle school tennis.  Most of the video is very good. but some of the students had difficulty following the lessons.  I think a slow motion or frame by frame of each lesson would help the students grasps the lesson.  I will use it again next spring when I have another group of new players.,1400112000,,326,4.311475409836065
4006351,5,B002WAEOS0,"I purchased this to go over the fundamentals of tennis with my son who has taken up an interest in the sport.  I felt like a female version of Richard Williams -- telling my son, ""watch your form,"" ""Keep your eye on the ball,"" ""Nice, nice!""  Okay, maybe that's a stretch, but I knew how to spend our time more effectively on the court.  Furthermore, I knew what mistakes to look out for/try to correct; I could better gauge his improvement because of this video.  I did not purchase the first edition of this video, but did read the reviews. It seems as if the director took some people's advice and improved the quality of the video and audio -- I thought it was very nicely done.  As most of you know, tennis is not an inexpensive sport.  We should applaud people like Guru Mony for providing such a wonderful resource at such an affordable price.  Before pouring tons of money into tennis camps, lessons, and academies, try the techniques/drills in this DVD first and see if tennis is your child's calling.  5 stars all the way around!",1367366400,11,1038,4.48404255319149

4006353,4,B002WAEOS0,"This DVD is very good option for those who really want to learn Tennis fundamentals right, get a quick start and improve their game. The DVD has good contents for forehand, serve, volley, overhead and single/double hand backhand. This DVD also has simple and good drills you can follow and repeat for each chapter. The video quality is really good and has very clear instructions for the different strokes, grips and footwork with help of arrows to reinforce techniques. Also, the 'Introduction to kids' chapter had several drills that I was able to go through with my 10 year old.",1355875200,9,581,4.82
4006354,4,B002WAEOS0,"I like this DVD. It covers the basics of tennis, easy to understand. When the DVD starts it plays the kids version automatically. I thought it did not cover all topics like serve, forehand etc. but when hit menu it show other topics. It would have been better if they did not automatically play the short version. Overall I recommend this to all beginners.",1347753600,3,356,4.578125
4006355,5,B002WAEOS0,"Great start for beginer tennis. Very well put together. Better than sixty dollars for lessons.  Good displays and instruction.

Best way to start learning.",1337299200,4,155,5.416666666666667

4006357,3,B002WAEOS0,"I have never played tennis before and decided as a 45 year old to give it a try. After buying new rackets and hitting the court about a dozen times with my husband I was ready for some pointers. I was hoping for an explanation of the court and scoring and basic rules of the games. The video provided none of this but did provide the basics on hitting the ball. How to hold the racket, how to swing the racket and how to tilt it this way and that way and how to step into your swing. All of this looked like good info sitting on my couch but you almost have to be on the court watching the video in order to get the full lesson. I think the information the instructor provided was good but both my husband and I had a hard time understanding his heavy accent. Knowing nothing about tennis he was using terms I was not familiar with so with the accent it was hard to understand and following.",1328486400,2,891,4.097142857142857
4006358,5,B002WAEOS0,"My son received this dvd as a birthday gift. He's always wanted to learn tennis, but never could get the hang of it. I would recommend this video to anyone wanting to improve their tennis game, or have kids that would like to learn. The introduction to kids segment is totally awesome! My son would watch it over and over until he had the skills down. The is movie like quality and is very clear. This video taught all the basics of tennis and more, and even recommended the proper racket size for an adult or child's size. You can't beat the price or the quality of this video of having your own tennis master with you at home while you practice during the demonstrations of serves, forehand, overhead, etc. The instructions are just at the right speed kids or an intermediate player. The video even has rallies, which were very exciting for my son to watch. The video even helps with many technical skills such as footing, various stokes, and different grip techniques to get the best out of your game, all the while advancing your skills. This was my son's favorite birthday present, even over a video game!! I highly recommend this product over any other tennis video. Trust me, you and your family would enjoy this purchase and it will definitely  benefit your game!!",1325721600,4,1272,4.60352422907489

4006360,5,B002WAEOS0,"This is a great instructional DVD for learning and improving your tennis skills. It provides lots of tips for the intermediate player and for the beginner, the correct foot work, body and arm positions as well as holding the racket the correct way. As a beginner, the best part is being able to watch the segiments of the DVD that I need extra help with so I can practice, practice, practice until I succeed! This is a great learning tool and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn tennis or improve their game!",1324166400,4,521,4.494736842105263
4006361,2,B002WAEOS0,"This dvd offers some basic tennis tuition and a few good ideas however the video quality is extremely poor. A decent hand held video camera nowadays would offer twice the quality at which this thing is shot. Strangely the graphics over the top of the video are quite readable and better than the video picture.

On the positive side the dvd does cover the main parts of the grip (a bit vague), hitting a forehand, backhand, serve and volley. All this is covered in 50 minutes which is about 10 minutes per section.  You won't be playing at Wimbleton after tuition from this video but there is enough to put together a basic game of tennis. For the price it is not too bad but I really cant get over the poor video quality and tinny music.",1309392000,,738,4.37956204379562

4006363,1,B002WAEOS0,"The video quality is like old Super-8 movies.  The sound track is not even close to being in synch with the visuals.  The tennis instruction is at best okay.  Let's just say I disagree with some of the technique they show (Straight-elbow backhand).  The Author/1st demonstrator never bends his knees or swing low to high and needs to understand body rotation better as well as kinetic chain.  His assistant is a much better model of strokes and should have been used throughout the video.  Leave the ""owner is in front of the camera"" to Frank Perdue.",1308700800,2,550,4.677083333333333
4006364,4,B002WAEOS0,"I was looking for a video to help teach fundamentals to my 6 year old who thinks he's the next Roger Federer.  Books and lessons just weren't getting through his know-it-all attitude.  When I saw the other reviews of this video I thought for the price, about the cost of one of his group lessons, it might be worth a gamble.

The first time I played it I was a little worried that this DVD wasn't going to have the desired effect either.  Some aspects of the production are not very slick, and he focused on that right away.  In particular the narrator's voice has a pretty heavy Indian accent and he complained about it so much that he claimed he couldn't understand and wouldn't even listen the first time I played the DVD.

But on the 2nd time I was pleased to see him picking up his racket in front of the TV and going through the drills.  And it actually worked.  Frankly nothing previously in his tennis instruction has had such a positive impact on improving his footwork and swing.

The methods presented in the DVD are consistent with those in books and instruction I've seen.  The video format is useful to reinforce those other media.

I'd give it 5 stars if the production was more professional (especially the narration).",1295049600,2,1234,4.513513513513513

The tennis mantra is like having your own private instructor in your home! Highly recommend if you're just learning to play tennis and you need to learn the correct way and all the basics , he teaches you everything except how to keep score!! My game has improved  a lot for someone who was just out to do it for a little exercise , I'm really able to play w/someone now!

Most indicated they watched it more than once because they were learning new things.  One player commented:  ""I now know how to make the ball go where I want it to go and I will be working on that specific skill often.""",1466035200,3,393,4.283783783783784
