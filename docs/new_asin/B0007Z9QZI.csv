8054506,3,B0007Z9QZI,"I am a belly dancer, and my 3-year-old daughter and I have just started taking a mother-daughter belly dance class. I was looking for a video that would be fun for us to do at home, to supplement the class.

This DVD features a rather brief but deadly serious introduction to the moves, and then many repetitions of the choreography. It is not what I would consider fun and kid-oriented. Most of the students are teens, with only one younger (elementary-school age) girl--who is hidden most of the time because she was placed right behind the instructor who is of course much taller. I would have been more comfortable if the girls' costumes had been a little less sexy and skimpy, particularly the Turkish-style bedlah sets in the freestyle dance section.

I was impressed with Amira Mor as a dancer and choreographer. The choreo is a beautiful cabaret-style veil choreo for duos. Amira Mor is graceful, flexible, athletic, and sexy (maybe a little too much so for my comfort, in a video purchased for use with my young daughter). I'm guessing her nationality may be Greek, since the video is set to Greek-style belly dance music, and her dancing strikes me as Turkish-influenced. Be aware that her personal style is smolderingly flirtatious, and she doesn't turn that off for this video.

All in all, I'm going to keep this video, and I'm sure we'll use it over the years, but I'm also going to try to find something else that's more like what I was actually looking for.",1189468800,8,1473,4.7015503875969
