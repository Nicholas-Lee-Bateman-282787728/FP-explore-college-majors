Ed Wood couldn't have made a cheesier biker flick!  HOWEVER, biker movies don't win Academy Awards.  You watch biker flicks for the choppers, fighting, nasty bikers, nasty biker women, and half-naked nasty biker women.  This has them all.  The storyline is secondary to the primary reasons we watch these flicks.  The basic plot is a white outlaw motorcycle gang and a black motorcycle gang are at odds and a gang war ensues. Its 90 minutes of corny R-rated biker action.",1266019200,,612,4.62037037037037
