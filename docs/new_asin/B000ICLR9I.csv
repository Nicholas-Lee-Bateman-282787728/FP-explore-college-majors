8144796,5,B000ICLR9I,"If you are looking for a DVD that explains Russian Christmas traditions, you will be disappointed. This DVD features scenes from some truly magnificent Russian churches and surrounding areas but the soundtrack is actually recordings of various Russian choirs singing traditional Russian Orthodox carols. You are not listening to actual carol singing at the various churches. There is no narration, though segment titles tell the viewer the location of each segment, and the choirs performances are wonderful. English (and other language) subtitles allow the viewer to understand the lyrics and combine with the music and images. This video could be improved with an alternate soundtrack available that does explain how Christmas is celebrated in Russia; or even better, Kultur could produce a companion DVD for that purpose.",1356134400,4,824,5.496062992125984
8144797,5,B000ICLR9I,This is a film I've purchased over ten times as a gift. This is the film for anyone who first loves to travel and second loves Our Lord. I had the awesome opportunity to visit Russia twice. Being of the Orthodox Christian faith this film provided the opportunity to see the beauty of Russia as depicted in its magnificient churches. The musical score greatly enhances the display of the film.,1337817600,4,392,4.614285714285714
