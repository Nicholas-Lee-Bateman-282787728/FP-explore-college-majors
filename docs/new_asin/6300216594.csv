269304,3,6300216594,"Having just viewed this film on DVD I have to say the acting, directing, on-location photography are all superb. No need to go into commenting of the storyline since other viewers have already done so.

However, from the other reviews, and coupled with one of the special features on the DVD it's apparent something is wrong with the DVD or just my copy.

My copy ends right after the young eskimo girl crawls into the snow, drunk and half-nude, then segues into the cast credits. The one feature shows several scenes which plainly take place after that, when justice is meted out to the sailors.

The entire story is logical and can do nothing but end in tragedy for all concerned, the Eskimos included. In the case of my DVD ending without the ending which should be there it's a sore disappointment. I'm now going to have to buy a VHS tape so I can view the conclusion.

I'd advise others to be careful in purchasing the DVD. It doesn't seem logical that there would be a handful of copies which were made without the movie's conclusion although anything is possible. I can say that viewing the movie without its conclusion is extremely frustating.",1171152000,4,1151,4.627450980392157
269305,4,6300216594,"The White Dawn was a film both ahead of and behind its time. In the early 70s a film about the fatal culture clash between three stranded whalers (Warren Oates, Lou Gosset and Timothy Bottoms) and a tribe of Inuits at the turn of the 20th Century was too early for the eco-friendly green lobby and far too late for either the hippies or the slew of early pseudo-documentary adventures like Nanook of the North and Men of Two Worlds, although a fight with a polar bear did manage to infuriate animal rights activists despite the animal being rather too-obviously unharmed. The film made barely a ripple at the box-office or with the critics before quietly disappearing and causing Paramount to cancel Philip Kaufman's intended follow-up for the studio, a Star Trek movie spin-off

Being a Kaufman film, the emphasis is on an alien, more spiritual way of life rather than high adventure as the trio of ""dog-children"" bring their saviors nothing but bad luck, their not necessarily hostile inability to understand and abide by a different set of cultural and moral values ultimately corrupting their hosts and ending in an uncharacteristic act of premeditated violence (the moral of the tale: never accept a pair of mittens from an Inuit). There IS a certain element of contrivance underpinning the story, most notably their conflict with a hostile travelling Shaman, but the film generally manages to avoid National Geographic voyeurism and patronising melodrama, taking its pace from the seasons and the move from hunting ground to hunting ground. Unlike The Savage Innocents and its all-too-obvious studio shooting and dubbing, it also benefits immensely from being shot entirely on location with non-professional actors.

Yet despite the strong visuals, in many ways the real star of the film is Henry Mancini's astonishingly beautiful score. A world away from the easy listening elevator musak he's now associated with, the style is closer to his lyrical score for The Molly Maguires without the melancholy, although the main theme was expanded from a piece an Inuit woman improvised on the set. Never released on record aside from a couple of extracts on Mancini compilation albums, Kaufman reused the lyrical theme for the orbiting the Earth sequence in The Right Stuff. It's a shame Paramount didn't include an isolated score on the DVD, although it does at least come with a couple of interesting featurettes and a commentary by Kaufman.",1151539200,11,2443,5.05955334987593
269306,5,6300216594,"This film, based on James A. Houston's fine book, is a fascinating glimpse into the Inuit way of life. The Inuit (commonly known as the Eskimo) culture remained unchanged for thousands of years but,as with all Native American people, thier culture rapidly became threatned once Europeans arrived onto the continent. Enough has been said about the plot, so I will just tell you that there is tremendous value watching the Inuit using ancient skills developed for hunting, killing and building igloos that are necessary to survive in the unforgiving environment on Earth. This film invites you into their intimate family life and reveals a clash of cultures that will haunt you for some time. The three lead American actors give a fine performance, but it is the Inuit people who are the true stars of this film.",1133654400,4,810,4.91970802919708
269307,5,6300216594,"When I saw the little 5 ft Eskimo get in his canoe and paddle out to an iceberg with a Polar Bear on it I was stunned.  He got on the iceberg with the Bear and he plunged his sticklike spear into the animals heart and killed it.  The bear was over 12 foot tall. The meat and the fur was used to keep his family fed and warm. What a culture shock, what a fine movie.  If you want to get lost in realism, rent or purchase this movie.  You will never forget it. It was also fun to see what the lead actors looked like when they were younger.",1010361600,4,538,3.81981981981982
269308,5,6300216594,"In the late 1800s three whalers are marooned in the far north. They are rescued by a migrating Eskimo community that provides them with food, shelter, and friendship. However the whalers never give up the idea of returning to their own civilization. They attempt to be rescued by stealing an Eskimo boat and their food supply for the coming winter. However they capsize and once again are rescued by the Eskimos, even after they had stolen their boat and food stores. But eventually the negative impact of the whalers upon the Eskimo reaches a climax that ends tragically. In reality the Eskimo culture has not thrived after contact with our modern civilization and they have a very high suicide incidence and excessive alcoholism rate. Perhaps this film can be looked at as a metaphor of the problems the Eskimo culture has encountered with their contact with Western culture in the modern world.
The performances, photography, and music are excellent. It is a fascinating film to watch, never boring, and deeply human. Warren Oates gives a classic performance as does Timothy Bottoms and Lou Gossett. However the really surprising performances came from the Eskimos. They were natural and expressive, really excellent and couldn't be improved upon. This is a fine film and I hope you enjoy it.",996796800,6,1295,5.0
269309,5,6300216594,"White Dawn is one of those rare films which is deeply rooted both in realism and mysticism.  The whalers who become marooned on the artic ice are unable to comprehend the goodness of the Inuits who save them.  With typical white man's arrogance and stupidity, they con the Eskimos with  paltry dishonest little tricks. To be dishonest, however, is not a part of  the primitive innocence of the Inuits, and they are easily duped. Worse,  they are made to lose face. Tim Bottom's youthful character is closest to  civilized innocence (being capable of love), but he caves to peer pressure  and first steals, then deserts a starving village.  But the white men are  out of their element as they steal an umiat and try to row away through ice  infested waters.  They are again saved by the people who they have shamed.  A second time they are brought back and again they show themselves  unworthy to live.  Tribal justice is meted out but without triumph. The  people have become sad for they have lost their innocence.  The folklore  and folklife of the Inuits is well researched. The honestly of the  directing is a high achievement. This film is exciting, and sometimes  difficult, to watch as white western sensibilities are exposed. -- Joel R.  Rudinger -- 1999",935280000,7,1262,4.75462962962963
269551,4,6300216594,New England whalers get lost and wind up as guests of some Inuits. The cultural conflicts quickly become apparent that leads to a climax. This film has a great ensemble cast and offers some interesting social scenarios with that gritty realism common in films made when this one was. There is occasional violence throughout. From a historical standpoint I thought it was a reasonable 'what if'.,1459987200,,394,4.984848484848484

269742,5,6300216594,"This is one of those films that nobody ever talks about, and you wonder why.  In fact, I'd never even heard of it before finally buying it.  What makes this film so special is that it is the ONLY one that shares the actual experience and intimate lifestyle of the Eskimo people, and how their life on the edge of civilization is an adventure in itself.  But it is much more than that.  It shows with both intensity, pathos, and ultimately sadness, how the meeting of ""modern"" man and ""savage"" can often have unexpectedly disastrous results, in spite of hopeful expectations.  Moreover, it is an important morality play, a warning of how man's encroachment upon fragile worlds can destroy both the invaders and the invaded.  A must-see.",1414022400,3,735,4.748031496062992
269743,4,6300216594,"I like the movie, but I find that the animal cruelty is sad, not to mention what the actors suffered to make this film.  It also is sad to note that the woman who acted the part of an accidental suicide truly committed one, as a result of alcoholic beverage introduced in concept to the culture involved in the making of this film. It was a worthwhile film and I hope the actors are well.",1406505600,,388,4.173333333333333

269746,5,6300216594,This is one of those unexpected movies that without expectation is sure to become one of your favorites.  It follows the lives of the Canadian Eskimos with such realism that there is no doubt you're watching the real thing.

269747,5,6300216594,"Once I saw this movie I realized how important the matrix that is fed you works. Here it is in black and white. When the community you love in, like the American Eskimo community that opens up a vision of the world that is supported by the inhabitants, than a window is opened that allows the community to see beyond the material world, and act in a way that is beyond general understanding. That is the message I took away. The movie captured and transcended me right into the Alaskan time and culture. The acting was realistically excellent. The ending was emotionally correct and surprisingly disturbing.",1324252800,,607,4.735849056603773
269748,4,6300216594,"Finally, I found this classic Philip Kaufman (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Right Stuff)film at a reasonable price and in great condition.  It is his fourth film and probably one of his best, right up there with ""The Right Stuff"".  Reportedly based on a true story, ""The White Dawn"" tells the tale of three seaman hunting for whales in 1896 who become shipwrecked in the Arctic and have their first encounter with Eskimos.  It is also the Eskimo's first experience with white men.  For those of you that have been lucky enough to see ""A Man Called Horse,"" you will see many correlations and just as fascinating.  Acting is top notch, even by the natives.  Cinematography is stunning and overall production values are first class.  A well thought out story, beautifully directed.",1318377600,2,787,4.87218045112782
