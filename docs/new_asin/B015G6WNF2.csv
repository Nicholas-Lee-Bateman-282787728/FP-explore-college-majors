7435910,5,B015G6WNF2,Perfect movie for older ski bums.  This movie is technically advanced for its age.  The race scenes and locations are stunning.,1456099200,2,127,5.0
7435911,5,B015G6WNF2,"Beautifully filmed and well acted, this film is even better than I remembered. In one of the special features, Redford says that his reason for wanting to make this movie was that winning, not just doing your best, had become the test for an athlete in this country, something that is even truer now than it was when this film was made.",1454284800,3,336,4.435483870967742
7435912,5,B015G6WNF2,"Downhill Racer,"" a scripted film shot in documentary style, is a look at the glamor of international ski racing. Robert Redford stars as David Chappellet, a ruthlessly ambitious skier competing for Olympic gold with an underdog American team in Europe. Gene Hackman (The French Connection), in a supporting role, plays Coach Claire, who tries to temper Chappellets narcissistic drive for glory.

With a screenplay by James Salter, Downhill Racer is a vivid character study enriched by some breathtakingly beautiful cinematography. It marks the feature debut of director Michael Ritchie, who would go on to direct Prime Cut, The Candidate (also with Redford), Smile and Fletch, among others.

This is the first feature film Robert Redford developed for himself, and he did much of the skiing. The downhill runs are filmed and edited in such a way that the viewer feels the rush of the sport. Several shots are from the point of view of the skier. Redfords Chappellet is arrogant, handsome, self-assured, and highly competitive  all qualities that help him rise in the sport. His character never seems a romanticized version of a skier. The movie also takes us behind the scenes of the industry behind the sport. Raising money for the national team is top priority even as the team travels from one contest to another.

The contrast between Chappellet and Claire provides the films primary dramatic conflict. Though Claire is turned off by Chappellets attitude, he knows that the skiers ambition is the teams single best chance for victory. Theres also a romantic subplot that simply cant compete with the films terrific action sequences.

Bonus content on the restored high-definition digital transfer Blu-ray edition includes interviews from 2009 with Robert Redford, screenwriter James Salter, and former downhill skier Joe Jay Jalbert, who served as a technical adviser, ski double, and camera operator; audio excerpts from a 1977 American Film Institute seminar with director Michael Ritchie; How Fast?, a 12-minute promotional featurette from 1969; and a critical essay.",1449014400,3,2074,5.291793313069909

8733473,5,B015G6WNF2,"One of the four movies made by Redford on winning at all costs.  Great filmwork and character development.  Especially the shallowness of egocentric Redford, and the reckless skier he portrayed

8733474,1,B015G6WNF2,"As a Redford fan and a sports movie fan I have to say this is some of the worst schlock I've ever seen.  Huge drawn out dialogues, oh wait, except there is nearly no dialogue in those scenes and when there is it's vapid, insipid and seemingly ad lib.  Redford isn't acting, he trying to figure out he talked the studio into doing a film that they didn't want to do, where the story didn't follow the book at all and on a shoestring budget, hence the blank stare 90% of the time.  Redford is often a reticent actor but this wasn't reticence it was constipation.

Easily the worst scoring of any movie I can think of, the first half was scored for a suspenseful B horror movie and the second half was scored for whatever bad record label needed to sell the stuff they couldn't sell to the Easy Rider producers.  The foley artist were equally bad.

Just a really bad movie..........and I really like movies from this era.  Try Grand Prix, it's basically the same premise but MUCH better.",1498608000,3,984,4.403314917127072

8733478,5,B015G6WNF2,"Downhill Racer is a portrait of a reckless young skier (Robert Redford) who navigates relationships, and conflict with his teammates and coach, played brilliantly by the great Gene Hackman. Redford and Hackman acting together made this film worth watching for me, but what took my breath away are the outstanding action sequences. The director used handheld cameras to capture the power and intensity of a skier racing downhill, only one mistake away from possibly serious injury.

I can't believe I had never heard of the film before, but it doesn't get much play on TV stations. I thank the Criterion Collection for bringing this film into posterity.",1480896000,,652,5.093457943925234
8733479,5,B015G6WNF2,"I resisted renting this movie despite strong recommendations by both Turan and Ebert, two movie reviewers I like to follow for ideas and insights. Both have intensely personal reactions to movies, which I find very useful in making up my own mind.

Eventually I gave in and rented from Amazon; the movie played perfectly on my ThinkPad over a very fast WIFI server in my apartment. Amazon has done a great job technically based on playing about 25 of their rentals.

The motion shots can be thrilling, but the best moments in this semi-documentary are times when nothing important seems to be happening. A glance, a shrug, an actor simply turns away, and embarrassed silence. The assembly line aspects of the racers going to the line and then being sent off was an interesting bridge between the great variety of the ways racers warmed up, and the thrilling and unpredictable action that followed.

Ebert's insight was right on the money for me: These moments ""form a portrait of a man that is so complete, and so tragic, that ""Downhill Racer"" becomes the best movie ever made about sports -- without really being about sports at all.""

The result for me is a character who seems to exist only for racing and what it will bring him; there is a deeply mechanical aspect to his personality that Redford, here early in his career, brings home beautifully. Other characters find that coldness off putting, and David Chappellet is very much an isolated individual.

Example: Davids father asks what all that skiing is going to get him. Ill be famous, David replies. Ill be a champion. To which his father crushingly replies, The worlds full of em.

Wonderfully satisfying movie.",1480723200,7,1673,4.811846689895471

8733481,5,B015G6WNF2,Another great job of restoration by Criterion.  We really love the movie and it really does have a great cast.  I think what makes it most enjoyable is the really great camera shots.,1470009600,,182,4.484848484848484
