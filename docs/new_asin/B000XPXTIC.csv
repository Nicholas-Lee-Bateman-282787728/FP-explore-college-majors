8229001,5,B000XPXTIC,"Brilliantly conceived, written, and directed by the independent filmmaker Anand Gandhi, ""Right Here Right Now"" traces the thread of events that start with the actions of a young man in the first scene. His rudeness in one case and his kindness in another set off chain reactions that play out in the lives of all the characters involved, heedless of the emotional impact they are having on one another as the effects of their ill will or goodwill spin off toward an amazing crescendo.

We are presented with all the vibrant color and unique flavor of the diverse cultures that make up Indian urban society, as reflected in dialog that is carried on in Hindi, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Marathi (subtitles are in English). The true-to-life scenes and superb acting of this fast-paced drama (run time: 29 minutes) work together with the seemingly casual filming to create an experience that is more like the unfolding of reality than the tightly crafted story that emerges when the threads are drawn together, swifter than a weaver's shuttle, to reveal a cosmic pattern of the human condition.

In the background we hear songs that underscore the narrative: ""You are the weaver and you are the thread. It's you who has tied the knot. O, intricate! Intricate! How intricately woven is this blanket."" And ""Yesterday, today, and tomorrow all lie in the Now. Listen to my song, Oh friends!""",1356480000,2,1382,4.901709401709402
