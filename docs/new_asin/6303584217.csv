7851494,5,6303584217,"Wow, I must have bought this over a decade ago but never thought to review it before...

Anyway, ""The Dance of Genghis Cohn"" on which this movie (telemovie?) is based, is an incredibly daring story of the ghost of a Jewish comedian who starts to haunt the Nazi who was responsible for his death. The story takes place in the 1950s or 1960s and is surprisingly lighthearted in stead of darkly vengeful. Really an unusual, but very impressive, movie!",1372723200,,448,4.670886075949367
7851495,5,6303584217,"In the summer of 1968 I read the English translation of the novel by Romain Gary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dance-of-Genghis-Cohn/dp/B001OXXH7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dance of Genghis Cohn</a>. It was a brilliant comic novel with many comments about culture that were far out compared to what I learned going to the same major universities where the Unabomber got his degrees. I stood over a hole that must have had a dud bomb in it after a B52 strike in Vietnam near the end of 1969, but I did not find out why one in ten bombs did not go off until years later. I keep returning to Genghis Cohn for the same reason.",1368403200,,677,5.277777777777778
7851496,5,6303584217,"The minute that KNME,  a  PBS station,  in Albuquerque, New Mexico aired this movie back in 1995,  I  knew I had to have it.  I  ordered my copy right then and there for $9.99  plus  shipping.  I  have  been following this and other cherished movies for when they are released on DVD.  I found the movie absolutely excellent, apart from a few minor technical flaws such as the 2nd SS officer apparently firing his Schmeiser MP40 up in the air;  a  fight sequence between some Brown-Shirt (S.A.) thugs and Cohn also not being very believable.  and the fact that this same ex-Nazi  SS man's toddler son could see the ghost of Genghis Cohn,  but previously it was said only the ""haunted""  SS members being pursued by Genghis Cohn could see him.  Especially wonderful was the opening sequence with Genghis Cohn  doing a  skit  as a ventriloquist and using Adolf Hitler as the dummy!  This only takes away  a shtikel of enjoyment from the movie  (although I have to admit,  I  would have LOVED to see a bit more bare skin on Diana Rigg,  who  has reached ZAFTIG PERFECTION in this movie!-  ""a thing of beauty is a joy forever""  and she was a bit deficient in the tushie department in the younger years!)  Overall, the movie is a real joy.  I only wish it lasted LONGER that its all-too-short
82 minutes  (forget what they tell you about 100 minutes!  Feh!)",1196208000,2,1351,4.483333333333333
7851497,5,6303584217,"This is not your typical Holocaust film, not even in the post-life is beautiful-days.  The plot, which is highly unusual, focuses on an ex-Nazi police comissioner who's being haunted by a Jewish comedian he executed during the war.  The policeman is trying to solve a series of sex crimes occuring, while those around him think he's going mad.  Undeniably funny, heart-wrenching and thought provoking, this movie deserves to be shaken out of the dusty corners of obscurity and proudly shelved next to Shindler's List, Sophie's Choice and Life is Beautiful.",1039478400,5,556,5.155555555555556
7851498,4,6303584217,"The first scene of this movie tells you right away that this is no ""docu-drama"" about the Holocaust. If you enjoy dark or bleak  humor, this is the film for you. Robert Lindsay and Anthony Sher are  brilliant (what else would you expect?), and the plot is a nice change from  the usual subject matter. I greatly enjoyed it.",966384000,5,323,4.440677966101695
