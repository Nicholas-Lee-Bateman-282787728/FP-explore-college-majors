3945809,3,B002LFJXKU,"I bought the 4 individual DVD's, Interviews Vol. 1 & 2, Fan Camera Footage, and Press Conferences.  All 4 of these DVD's are the same as what is in the Mega Box, which is half the price of these 4 DVD's.  The only difference is that you don't get the postcards with the Mega Box.  Some of the interviews are worth watching, but I suggest saving some money and buying the Mega Box instead of the 4 individual DVD's.  If the write-up for the Mega Box had said that it was those same 4 DVD's, I wouldn't have purchased the individual ones AND the Mega Box.  But I didn't know, so they got an extra $65 dollars from me that I shouldn't have had to spend.  Oh, well.  Live and learn!",1258502400,29,678,4.129770992366412
3945810,5,B002LFJXKU,"Re: L.P. Quagmire's horrid comments....the '93 charges brought by Evan Chandler were extortion - he wanted Michael to ""fund"" his screenwriting career to the tune of $5 million a year for 4 years. When that didn't work he tried other ways. Michael had agreed on $350,000 but Chandler wasn't satisfied with that. That's when he decided to go after Michael for these bogus charges. Remember, he went to an unreputable attorney rather that the police! What parent would do that? He promised to ruin Michael. It went only to a civil court and 95% of these are settled out of court. Years later Jordie went to Michael, apologized and said he was forced to say things by his father. The 2003 charges were brought by a welfare mother who willingly spent Michael's money while at Neverland, let the kids trash the house and disrespect everyone who worked for Michael. This woman had sued JC Penny and got approx $156,000 from them, charging physical abuse by the security guards after being caught shoplifting.  To make a long story short, Michael was exonerated. Think about this for a minute. How many 1,000's of children did Michael help and have at Neverland? Only 2 came forward at the urging of their parents? Use your head Quagmire (great name for you)Give Michael the respect he so richly deserves and let him rest in peace.

I plan to order everything Michael Jackson, including these DVD's The Interviews. I know enough about them to know they are going to be good.",1258416000,34,1466,4.745098039215686

I thought I'd give some brief information on the DVD. The back of the case says:

""Michael Jackson the Interviews Vol 1 presents a 2 hour DVD programme showing various in depth interviews which reveal an honest and frank insight into why Michael became the world's biggest superstar. Presented together for the very first time is this essential collection which also includes - The King of Pop, a 32 page book. This newly written book is a tribute biography and discography which includes a special tribute section on the Staples Center memorial in Los Angeles.

We have also transcripted a very recent seance where Michael is asked questions that were responded to using a Ouija board, a fascinating connection that will bring peace of mind to many of Michael's fans.""

I really enjoyed this DVD, it had a good number of interviews with Michael himself from different stages of his life. It made me feel like I knew him a bit better afterwards and I was surprised to find some stuff that I did not know.",1257897600,10,1859,7.548387096774194
3945812,1,B002LFJXKU,"I have wasted money and time by purchasing pre-order items in the past.  If you really want to see the very few interviews Michael Jackson agreed to doing (Oprah, Walters & Bashir) simply log onto You Tube.  You'll save your money and it's not a waste of time.",1257206400,6,260,4.395833333333333
3945813,1,B002LFJXKU,"I agree with everyone else.  Alot of people are making money off of Michael Jackson and we're the ones paying for it.
If it's the Interviews by Rabbi Schmuley Botteach I'd consider buying them as I am now reading the book and it's very interesting.
But this that they are advertising can be anything by anyone!  Ridiculous!
Do buy the ""This is It"" DVD for those of you who can't get to the movies.  I seen it today at the theatre and it was awesome and I am buying the DVD as well.  I could watch it over and over again.
RIP Michael.",1256860800,13,533,4.145631067961165
3945814,1,B002LFJXKU,"I have reason to be suspicious of materials on Michael Jackson that give you NO review of it from the person who produced it! Why isn't there any synopsis of what the interviews are? It is an insult to me that the producer of this video chooses to not tell the potential customer anything about the product! I refuse to give money to people who don't seem to care enough about me as a Michael Jackson fan. It seems that you have something to hide....if this is NOT the case, then give a description of this video. Is that too much for the customer to ask?! I don't think so.",1256774400,9,574,4.2272727272727275
3945815,5,B002LFJXKU,"I have made the mistake in the past of blindly pre-ordering a couple of Michael Jackson videos without there being any customer reviews and was very disappointed by the merchandise in question.

They were both horrible with generic music playing in the background, and they were both almost copycat videos of each other. What a big waste of money.

It seems like people are coming out of the woodwork to capitalize on his death, and his devoted fans are looking to buy anything just to hold onto him a little while longer because we are all still in mourning over him.

I won't make that mistake again. I want to remember him and his words, not the things other people said about him, and though I am very curious to know what these interview videos are all about, I will also wait until people post some reviews before I waste more money on garbage.

By the way, the videos that ended up being a total waste of money were Michael Jackson ""Never Surrender"" and ""A Remarkable Life."" Don't throw your money away.  They were both very cheap and poorly done.",1256083200,89,1054,4.526315789473684

3945830,5,B002LFJXKU,"Although some of the quality of the picture is lacking, it is understandable as you go right back to when Michael was a a child, but it didn't matter - wow - you get to see Michael at different times of his life, he was just amazing and adorable and beautiful. The Oprah interview was especially good as well as the one with Lisa Marie by his side. It broke my heart at times, when he let on how much some of the things the media say hurt him. You can tell what an intelligent man he was, very very deep and spiritual. There is a part at the end where he can stop giggling for the interview and that had me laughing along with him. Michael is like that - when he laughs you laugh with him, but when he crys you cry too. Any fan will love this DVD.",1286755200,2,747,3.9536423841059603

3945832,2,B002LFJXKU,I rented these DVDs.  I was disappointed that someone is selling these interviews to make money.  All of these interviews are on YouTube.  Some of it is very poor video quality.,1272672000,,177,4.645161290322581
3945833,4,B002LFJXKU,"I am very glad to see the complete interview of Michael that Oprah did back in the 1980's. The interview that someone did at Michael's home

has too much background noise. The quality of the sound is poor. I was not pleased with the lack of divisions that DVD's come with that allow you to skip from one

interview to the another without having to scroll through all of the tape to find what you want efficiently. That is too time consuming. I am glad that it

includes the interviews with Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyers. I will look for a better quality DVD of Michael's interviews, but I am glad to have this volume1.",1267488000,,622,4.391304347826087
3945834,5,B002LFJXKU,"Definitely 5 stars and a must for a Michael Jackson fan, especially now that he is no longer with us.  Worth the price just for the big interviews with Oprah and Diane Sawyer.  Even though some of the earlier ones are not as good quality, the true fan will still appreciate having these keepsakes of a performer that truly was one of the greatest.  If you are not that big of a Michael Jackson fan, you may not want to invest in this.  How much you like it may depend on how much you would like to own anything you can on what Michael left behind.  Many of the interviews I had never seen and am glad I own them now.",1265414400,3,616,4.0578512396694215
3945835,4,B002LFJXKU,I was glad I watched this and saw some interviews I had never seen.  Ones that were a bit more candid from a younger icon.  The best was he and Latoya just acting like brother and sister (including him telling her that her shrill voice was so annoying!)  Certainly not the greatest quality of footage -- I would have thought that they would be able to tighten up film from the 80's -- but then again this is an unauthorized cut.  But it was a nice touch to the angelic man that will be missed forever...,1265328000,5,503,4.208333333333333

3945840,5,B002LFJXKU,"Today I went to f.y.e (For Your Entertainment) and saw this DVD, along with volume 2, siting on the shelf calling my name. I was skeptical at first after reading one star reviews, bought I picked it up anyway. I DO NOT REGRET IT! It has many interviews from the time of the early Jackson 5 to his collaboration with will.i.am! The interviews are in very good quality for being so old! It also comes with a 32 page book with 2 unique postcards. When it says it has no music by the artist...it kinda lied. While durring one or two different interviews his music is quietly played, and he makes comments on them. I recomend it to any Michael Jackson fan.
It has his Barbra Walters Interview, two Oprah interviews, an interview at his home durring the Thriller era, and so many more. Buy it! Like me, you won't regret it!",1259971200,4,817,4.381578947368421
3945841,5,B002LFJXKU,"i purchased this dvd included in my mega-box set which came not too long ago - this was really fun for me to watch.

there is an interview with michael and jackie which it starts out with, then mj talks about his dreams coming true, there is a scene where he introduces his llama (louie), some footage of seeing princess diana, an interview at the end where michael has a case of the giggles (which is very cute), an interview with lisa marie and michael together and my personal favorite is the interview with oprah. this was conducted at neverland and he even does some dance moves for oprah! there are a couple more interviews in here as well which were phenominal to see.

i am glad i purchased this dvd within the maga-box set instead of just by itself since it worked out a lot better financially do it that way.",1259366400,3,818,4.375

3945844,1,B002LFJXKU,"Sorry for continuing on a somber note, but other tragedies dominated the headlines this week, specifically tragedies related to Michael Jackson. First Evan Chandler--father of Jordan Chandler, the boy who first accused Michael of molestation--committed suicide by handgun, sparking speculation that he'd perhaps done so out of guilt over the whole child molestation scandal that arguably started the downward spiral of the fallen King Of Pop's bizarre life. We shall never really know, and there was no suicide note at the scene.

Sorry, just ordered this video two hrs. ago. Will post my review after I watch it. I just had to click on one star for now so I can post the news. RIP Michael. Miss you everyday.",1258848000,,709,4.957983193277311
3945845,5,B002LFJXKU,"BUY IT!

If you are a true Michael Jackson fan you will love this DVD.  It is interviews with Michael Jackson himself from the age of 10, with Barbara Walters, Oprah (amazing interview), Diane Sawyer with Lisa Marie Presley by his side, etc.

There is one ""interview"" with Michael with LaToya in the early 80's where you get to see Michael is a typical brother.  LaToya doesn't understand one of the questions asked of her and MJ rolls his eyes and says in a Groucho Marx voice ""I have an idiot for a sister.""  Hysterical.  I laughed out loud and had to replay it a few times because it was so great.

This DVD gives a true picture of who Michael Jackson is as a person.  Nice.

I didn't want to give it 1 Star, because it's Michael and NOTHING about him says, 1 Star. The rating of 1 Star is about the selling of these DVDs. I will not be sold on these types of DVDs again.

Please stop doing this! Stop making cheap crap to sell about Michael. He was and still is the most dynamic human being to ever have walked, danced and existed period on a stage and on this Earth. These videos are worthless. The interviews are not relevant at all. It's been DONE too many times.
