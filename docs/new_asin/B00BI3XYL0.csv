5622311,5,B00BI3XYL0,"I haven't actually watched it yet but if it's similar to the other Combat DVD I bought last year I'm sure it's gonna be good.  Combat was a great TV show from the 60's that very few people appreciate.  It had it all.......action, excitement, drama, and a few moral messages as well.  My wife (who doesn't generally like war movies) even likes Combat!!!",1407283200,,352,4.555555555555555

5622316,5,B00BI3XYL0,"Combat is a great show, easily 5 stars.  This set, however, does not come with any episode guide as to what episodes are on what disc, it is very annoying!  You have to find a list of episodes by year (making sure the order matches that of this set) and mark it off at four episodes per disc if you want to be able to find a particular episode.  Again, very annoying!",1397865600,,367,4.069444444444445

8568832,5,B00BI3XYL0,"If you like the series, ""Combat,"" then this is a must have. Lots of action and special episodes of individual cast members plus many guests.
