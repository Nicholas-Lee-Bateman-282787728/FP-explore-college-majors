This may be her earliest work on a series T.V. show. Furthermore, I did miss Jack being on this season of the show. Regrettably, this is the last season of the show.",1438214400,4,322,4.209677419354839

8717603,5,B00Y7R9H0G,I have waited for so long to see this series again & I was not disappointed.  The series is quality entertainment.  Erin Moran was a sheer delight in one of her first TV roles.  Marshall Thompson was & still is one of my favorite actors.  It has a REAL feel to it & I would recommend this purchase to any DVD collector.  :),1475366400,,323,4.063492063492063
