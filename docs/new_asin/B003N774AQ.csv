4156511,4,B003N774AQ,"As I already had said in my other two Bionic reunion movies, I grew up with these shows and I loved them, then. Though corny and predictable, this is the best of the three Bionic reunion tv movies. Unlike its two predecessors, this film focues on Steve and Jaime and their relationship. This tv movie takes off where the series left off. Steve and Jaime marry, but not without a few stumbling blocks put in their path. Their is action and the movie moves along at a stable pace.
I had taped this off tv when it had originally aired. Would I recommend someone buying it; if you are a fan of the two original shows, you'll enjoy this one. It is corny, predictable, yet entertaining.",1345075200,8,680,4.404761904761905
