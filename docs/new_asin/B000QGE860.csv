Charles John Huffam Dickens, pen-name ""Boz"", was the foremost English novelist of the Victorian era, as well as a vigorous social campaigner --- Considered one of the English language's greatest writers, he was acclaimed for his rich storytelling and memorable characters, and achieved massive worldwide popularity in his lifetime --- championed his mastery of prose, his endless invention of memorable characters and his powerful social sensibilities --- Dickens worked for sentimentality, implausible occurrence and grotesque characters while capturing the essence of the people and their time --- The popularity of Dickens' novels and short stories has meant that not one has ever gone out of print. Dickens wrote serialised novels, the usual format for fiction at the time, and each new part of his stories was eagerly anticipated by the reading public - (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

8196378,4,B000QGE860,Interesting portrayal.  There's always something you don't like--the scary stories told him as a child resulting in bad dreams and the tarring was brutal.  But the movie portrays Dickens as respectful of and caring for his parents--altogether very likeable character.  I enjoyed the costumes and depiction of life at that time.,1422230400,,327,5.372549019607843

8196382,1,B000QGE860,"Someone recommended the episode on Dickens' meeting with Edgar Allan Poe so I checked that disc out from my library. Since Dickens left no details about this meeting, I knew it was going to be fictionalized, which I was okay with. I expected something interesting, but it was mostly a poor adaptation of one of Poe's tales presented as Dickens' (perhaps) true experience with him. The other episodes on that disc were just as disappointing. They left me with absolutely no interest in the rest of the series.

Any background presented is very cursory, little more than a few lines or short scenes, leaving the viewer to wonder how those things actually worked out. There was a lot of background to cover, so perhaps a longer series going more deeply and extensively into it would have been better.

I would not even accept this DVD set for free because the part I've seen was a waste of my time.

There have been a great number of books written about Dickens and most of them would probably be a better use of your time. I'm not an expert, but I found ""The Annotated Christmas Carol"" by Michael Patrick Hearn quite enlightening, and it would serve as an beginner's introductory shortcut to that story and Dickens' life. I'm sure people more knowledgeable will have better recommendations.",1344988800,,1288,4.741071428571429
8196383,4,B000QGE860,"This is a very good series about the author Charles Dickens and his life.  The acting is the best part-- especially since Roy Dotrice is a natural as Dickens, and those playing his wife and children are quite convincing.  There are really authentic period costumes and fine but not elaborate sets. It is the appeal of telling a life story of a famous author in a simple, old fashioned way.  Most of the series is historically accurate, although the Edgar Allan Poe episode may be somewhat conjectural. This series was done mostly on video, and being made in the 1970's with the technology of that time, it has an unsophisticated look.  It was shown on Masterpiece Theatre in the U.S., but this appears to be the U. K. broadcast version since there was no host at the beginning of each episode. This edition does not include any bonus features. There are only four discs without the performance of ""A Christmas Carol"", which was included on a bonus disc in the 2007 edition. That edition offered more for the viewer. It seems a bit strange and unfortunate because the new set is supposed to be a special edition.  Still, it is worthy of purchase since all thirteen parts of the original miniseries are included.  Also, the price is much lower (now it is under $23 at Amazon) than most DVD sets containing four discs.  This is a good set, but some additional features about Dickens' life and times would have made it much better as a bicentenary edition.",1344729600,12,1452,4.626459143968872
8196384,5,B000QGE860,"Charles Dickens remains a powerful force and a wonderful treasure in English letters.  While he is not read as much as he once was and certainly deserves more attention in our schools, there is no reason for you to not treat yourself to his wonderful multifaceted genius.  I think that the vast difference in our 21st Century American culture is so different than his pre-Victorian England (particularly London) that some readers can't find an easy way into his works.  This wonderful 13 part mini-series from 1976 can provide a help in understanding something of that time and place and in the ways that Dickens used his own life in his writing.

This series is not a straight biography of Dickens.  We meet the mature Dickens on one of his profitable and sensational American tours.  His experiences in American cause him to think back on his life and we experience portions of his biography in these flashbacks.  The script is quite faithful to the events depicted in these looks backward into the author's life.  Obviously, the writers had to make choices between debatable events and they filled in some gaps with fictions that captured the time and some possibilities in Dickens' life that also show up in his writing.  The mature Dickens that is on the American tour is made up as a narrative device and captures the flavor of what Dickens experienced as a celebrity in mid-19th Century America, but the people and events are fictions to setup the flashbacks and expose the character and talents of Dickens in his maturity.

The way this story is presented shows us his complicated domestic life without ever getting explicit.  The period of his life when he separated from Catherine is completely left out.  I guess the ability to pick and choose among events is an advantage of the flashback as a narrative device.

The actors in his series are superb.  Roy Dotrice needs to be singled out for playing the mature Charles Dickens and Dickens the man in his flashbacks.  He also does the hat trick as Charles' father, John.  Charles Dickens had a complicated relationship with his parents.  This series chooses to focus on his improvident father, John, who was a Naval clerk and always spent more than he made.  While he is depicted here as an inebriate and that this was the source of the family suffering, there is less evidence in real life of why he was always getting himself so deeply in debt.  Some have suggested gambling, which is briefly touched on here.  There is no doubt that, on the whole, people drank alcoholic beverages much more then than we do now.  John is such a critical character because Charles used him so often in his works, Wilkins Micawber in ""David Copperfield"" being the most well known.  Dotrice can be very proud of his accomplishments in this series and I think you will find the way he characterizes the three characters memorable and impressive.  His daughter, Karen Dotrice, plays Dickens' first infatuation, Mary Beadnell in a delightfully frivolous manner.

The boy Charles is played with moving vulnerability by Simon Bell, and as a young man by Gene Foad.  Foad portrays the young Dickens in full ego of a young genius who is becoming aware of his powers and trying to find his own way in the world.  A terrific piece of acting.  Lois Baxter plays Mary Hogarth, the middle of the Hogarth daughters and the one person with whom Dickens seems to have been able to share work with.  She died suddenly and seventeen and Dickens wore her ring on his little finger the rest of his life.  Christine McKenna also does a fine job as Georgina Hogarth, the youngest of the Hogarth daughters who also came to live with them at the request of Catherine to help run the household after 1842. The real life companionship Dickens developed with Ellen Ternan is not touched on in this series.

Some have criticized the fantasy episode with Edgar Allen Poe (effectively done by Samuel Matthews).  This event never happened, but is there to show the way such mysterious pseudo-science was taken seriously by so many people at that time.  Even the episode with the young Ben Kingsley as Dr. John Elliotson (who did exist) shows that Dickens was introduced to mesmerism and took it seriously.  He did use it on his family and was considered fairly skilled at it.  I took these as efforts by the writers to capture the times as much as the life of Dickens.  After all, how literally can you depict the life of a fabulist like Dickens and still remain true to the man?  If you merely depict the events that we have documented evidence for the real Dickens will have escaped.

Yes, the way the English filmed such series in the 1970s looks a bit liked a taped stage production to us, but it did not bother me in the least.  I loved everything about this series and recommend it to you very strongly.

The package also as a full performance of the way Dickens presented his ""A Christmas Carol"" on his tours.  Simon Callow does a fine job, but I think his presentation is probably a bit more formal than Dickens himself might have done.  I think Dotrice's presentation of a tiny portion of this in the series is more appealing and likely.  Callow's seems, somehow, a bit Victorian and Dickens was not, in my view, in any sense like the late Victorian clich we seem to suppose they were.  But this is trivial.  Callow is terrific and it is a treat to experience such a 19th Century entertainment.  The audience is even in full period dress.

This series is a wonderful experience that can help you and your children get ready to dig into the actual Dickens more deeply.  I encourage you enjoy both the series and the actual writing of Dickens.",1224806400,17,5663,4.668012108980827
8196385,1,B000QGE860,"This one made me antsy.... I just couldn't stand the lead actor...just ""too much"" --- his mannerisms drove me nuts.
I never finished watching it and donated it to Friends of
the Library sale.....wasted my money.+",1206662400,,212,4.916666666666667
8196386,3,B000QGE860,"I never saw this when originally played on television back in the '70's. If I did, I'm sure my memory would have given me doubts in purchasing this multi-DVD set.
It begins pretty much on the right track, showing Charles Dickens as a young boy with his father and their ""adventures"" together. Much of the concentration tends to be on his father as much as on Charles, almost in a comedic way, showing the influence he had on his son.
It is pretty much right on, giving us a glimpse of the early life of this Victorian author, including his unfortunate occupation in a blacking factory. No child labor laws here!
Next we see Charles as a young man, beginning his career as a writer. It shows us how he met his future wife, Catherine Hogarth, his obsessive love toward his sister-in-law, who, sadly, dies before the age of twenty, the strange relationship he and Kate had, and, if true, his own - dare I say it - anal personality. Yes, he did not come off as the nicest of people. Throughout these middle episodes we see Mr. Dickens' behavior continue to become rather eccentric, and not necessarily in a good way. He grows to be, at least in my eyes, an unlikable person, one who can snap at any moment; one who does not treat his wife nor his friends in an agreeable manner. (Although Kate comes off as a bit of a winer. Then again, he did marry her and not her sister, right?). This also shows the famous author as a womanizer, an unfortunate truth. And, according to this, much of his flirting was thrown directly into Kate's face. If this is true, she deserved to be a winer. I am assuming here that this is correct, seeing that the Charles Dickens Museum folk gave their support for this project.
Then this biography takes some odd twists and turns, especially devoting a complete (wasted) episode on a bizarre encounter with Edgar Allen Poe, and another, well, WASTED episode where he does magic tricks. A bit of editing could have put both of these encounters onto one episode.
The series, as a biography, ends a bit quicker than expected in that, for his earlier novels such as The Old Curiosity Shop or the Pickwick Papers, more time is spent than, say, Martin Chuzzlewit. And the fact that the importance of Chuzzlewit selling poorly was imperative to the writing of ""A Christmas Carol"" was barely touched upon.
And that's where the series ends, except for another wasted episode called 'Memories,' the very last of the series. Why was this last episode, which harkens back to young boy Charles, even made? Except for showing the death of his father, it's useless as a biography.
It's these wasted episodes, which, for taking up so much of our time, had little bearing on his life, that anger me. I would have rather had the drama show the complete reason in his writing ""Carol"" and the after effects it had rather than the three wasted episodes I mentioned.
All in all, this is OK to watch once, but not worthy of your hard-earned cash in a purchase.",1193011200,21,2960,4.544943820224719
