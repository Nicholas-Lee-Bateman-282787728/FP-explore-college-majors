7943477,4,B00005KHKN,"After the first volume, I couldn't wait to get my teeth into the second. Once again, it only has three episodes, but it left me feeling quite satisfied.
These episodes take a break from the dragon storyline of the first volume, and instead gives us a little time to get into the characters some more. The first episode is a cute little story about a resort that Cleo wants to visit, but of course Orphen says no. He then wakes up the next morning to find both Cleo and Majik gone. You really have to sympathise with Orphen; he has to put up with that kind of thing now. I found this episode to be filled with comedy, and laughed out loud on more than one occasion.
Next we have a two-parter with a rather serious tone. Orphen and gang come across a village - a very anti-sorcerer village. Needless to say, they get in quite a bit of trouble, but there's more to the village than meets the eye. We get some sweet romance between Majik and the village priestess, and an insanely cute new member joins the gang - Leki the Wolfen pup.
Overall these episodes do nothing to further the overall plot, which is a shame after seeing the first volume, but this volume is still very good. By the end, we know the main characters very well, and I look forward to the next volume.",1067817600,,1267,4.305439330543933

Cleo, never taking no for an answer, sneaks off with Majic in the night to visit Kahlna and they find the two trolls along with the sword of Baltanders along the way.  More thrills follow, what is the monster of Khalna and what do Azuli and Orphen have to do with it? Episode 2 lands Majic in a run down prison in the village of the forest dwelling 'Wolfin' worshipers after a chance meeting with the priestess, Fiena.  Later in the forest, while searching for Majic, Cleo stumbles across a wolfin puppy and decides to keep it, a decision she later regrets as it may cost Orphen his life!
