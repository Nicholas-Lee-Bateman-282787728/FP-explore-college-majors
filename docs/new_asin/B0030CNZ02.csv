8385743,5,B0030CNZ02,My  son wanted this video and I couldn't find it anywhere. Going into stores the sales person would burst out laughing when I would tell them the title. I finally found it here and he was grinning from ear to ear when he opened it.,1369353600,,231,4.133333333333334
8385744,3,B0030CNZ02,This DVD is very educational in some ways and in other ways it did not go into a lot detail I wish it would have! But I will say for coon hunting they got some good footage of some hunts! Now I was not very impressed with video quality it seemed like it was filmed by a young kid a lot of moving around during hunts a lot of trying to focus at the last moment kind of thing at one part they was hunting at night with night vision but probly 8 mins of that night hunt was just dark it just left you looking at the screen thinking OK Im watching a black screen then and there he would turn on the flashlight to see if the coon was out yet then it was dark again they could of added talking of something or even edit it to go right to the shot. Also there was a lot of parts that left you looking at the screen at guy just talking about nothing or not talking to the camera at all . but it did a good job still telling you stuff and what to look for and what to do plus it ad some cool hunting shots and coons charging the decoy or the call . So if you are looking for good filmed DVD this is kind of home maid kind of deal but it did job and it might for you also. So go for it,1357776000,,1175,3.685258964143426
