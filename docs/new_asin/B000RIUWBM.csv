8200890,5,B000RIUWBM,"I'm R. Kelly's biggest fan. I just recieved my dvd and I can't stop watching it. First of all, this dvd includes the 2 episodes of Access Granted that I missed. I taped every episode of Access Granted that R. Kelly did on BET but Flirt and Ignition, so I'm glad they're included here. I love the interview with Kellz talking about growing up in Chicago and the first song he ever wrote, etc. I'm also glad that his BET Silver Anniversary performance is included as well as the Let Your Light Shine video. The only thing I don't like is the dvd says there's a 106 & Park interview, but there's not, only a clip of him singing Sex in the Kitchen on 106 & Park. I was hoping his first 106 & Park interview when he performed I Wish was on this dvd. Also You Saved Me is also not included. Other than those minor complaints, this dvd is great. Recommended to all the real R. Kelly fans. This dvd has my stamp of approval.",1282608000,5,916,4.1807909604519775
