8243352,3,B00120TJF4,"If you are buying this DVD mermaids of tiburon to see Diane webber topless, don't buy it. Many topless girls but not miss webber. The only topless photos I've see of her are in an old spotlight magizne, which I don't see for sale anywhere. This DVD has good pic quality and as I said many topless emps, no tail yet.",1432857600,,315,4.180327868852459
8243353,4,B00120TJF4,"""Mermaids"" features remarkably good ocean photography for early-1960's, the excellent marine photographer is the true star of this. You will either love this film or hate it, likely no in-between. Extensive nudity in the uncut version. The other film is mostly for lovers of Psychotronica type films or films with a non-Hollywood, different style for a change of pace.",1431129600,,368,5.254237288135593
8243354,5,B00120TJF4,"Love this film! I was 7 when I saw the black & white and never forgot it. Timothy Carey steals the show, as he does in every film he was in.

I prefer the original, the remake with the nudity is good, but I didn't like how the ""mermaids"" had a tail, then flippers, then feet. Gaby Martone has a beautiful body, but her face is fug, compared to Diane Webber's.",1408147200,,359,4.056338028169014
8243355,1,B00120TJF4,"Looking for mermaid tale..not T and A...very disappointed. Would not have bought this if clearer description had been given, Ruined one of my all-time favorite movies.",1400112000,,167,5.461538461538462
8243356,3,B00120TJF4,"This is a fun little trip back to cheesy titillation films of the early 60s. Story lines are barely there, acting is fairly amateur, and production values are nothing to write home about. As a matter of fact, ""cry of the Bewitched"" is barely watchable!

That said, this may be the ONLY way you'll ever see the fabulous, late Diane Webber in action. As a former Playboy Playmate and a world-renowned nudist appearing in countless magazines of the late 50s and early 60s, Ms. Webber graced many a workshop wall and teenaged boys fantasy. This is worth the price of admission just to see her (and her mermaid fiends) frolicking in the waters around Mexico.",1377648000,,653,4.678260869565217

NOT THE NUDE VERSION, MIND YOU!! MY 5 STAR RATING IS FOR THE ORIGINAL VERSION ONLY, which is included in this collection & suitable for children of all ages. WHAT A JOYFUL FANTASY!! While this movie never reached cult status due to the director/witer/producer Mr. JOHN LAMB's TINKERING WITH HIS OWN ORIGINAL THAT IS A MASTERPIECE OF LOW BUDGET FILMAKING(a lesson to be learned by a certain rich contemporary filmaker who's destroying his own original masterpieces by adding & re-editing)& EXCELLENT UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHY THAT GIVES SOLID COMPETION TO ANY JACQUES COUSTEAU's DOCUMENTARY. Starring the under rated Mr. GEORGE ROWE(playing scientist Dr. Samuel Jamison) & THE BEATIFUL Ms. DIANE WEBBER (mermaid Queen) & both actors doing their own underwater scenes. The story evolves as a solid murder mystery which leads Dr. Jamison to the isolated Island of Tiburon while trying to solve the disappearance of another scientist who had discovered unknown treasures, and finds himself discovering the existence of beautiful mermaids. SEE THE ORIGINAL VERSION WITH GREAT RESTORED COLOR & SOUND!! Unfortunately the nude version adds scenes that are totally distracting & underplays Ms. WEBBER's beauty & talent.",1315958400,3,1629,6.149122807017544
8243358,5,B00120TJF4,"Like most film buffs, I had only seen the circulating black-and-white prints of MERMAIDS OF TIBURON.  The DVD is a revelation, with gorgeous color.  The B&W version was more of a crime film, but the color version is primarily a showcase for the mermaids, who are shown swimming topless underwater, etc.  This may have been the version that was released to adults-only theaters while being retitled THE AQUA SEX.

The DVD also presents a hybrid print that is in color but deletes most of the topless footage.  So, if you have an underwater enthusiast visiting who might not want to see the nudity, you can show the ""family"" version instead.

The DVD presents the film in better quality than I ever expected for this title, and the image is letterboxed as well.  However, my copy doesn't have the promised audio commentary track (perhaps they didn't get around to doing that). This is the best transfer of MERMAIDS OF TIBURON that we're likely to see.",1264636800,12,949,4.75
8243359,5,B00120TJF4,"Interesting couple of films.....I had seen ""Mermaids"" in the original black and white version a few years ago. It was an odd experience to see it in color and the story is more focused on the topless mermaids than the plot of the original version. The original b&w version was centered around Diane Webber's performance as a mermaid. She is a minor player in the color version.

The second film in the set has an exceptional percussion soundtrack with singing. The drum/vocal compositions remind me of Haitian music that I've heard. The plot is mildly interesting, but the drumming is mesmerizing. I'd recommend this combo DVD for the drumming of the second film.",1232150400,10,663,4.867256637168142
