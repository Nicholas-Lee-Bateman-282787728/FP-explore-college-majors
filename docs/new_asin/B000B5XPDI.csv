8081856,3,B000B5XPDI,"'Ventarrn' is a well-mounted B production from the golden age of Mexican cinema. All the noir elements are there, including a brash score by Rosalo Ramrez. Principals David Silva and Martha Roth do a fine job and have good chemistry.

Best of all may be the nightclub scenes, and especially the musical numbers by Juan Bruno Tarraza and sultry vocalist Tana Lynn. Just short of four stars.",1473724800,,514,5.130952380952381
