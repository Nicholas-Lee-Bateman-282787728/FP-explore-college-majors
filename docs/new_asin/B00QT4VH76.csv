I am a Navy/Army retiree, and moved around a lot, I haven't seen most of this series.
Since I retired to Europe, these episodes will, literally, be a breath-of-home that I
missed during my ""tour-of-duty"".

VERY enjoyable series cram-packed with familiar faces, many of which, no longer with us.

Sincerely Yours,
Michael McCluskey

6879534,5,B00QT4VH76,"As a casual fan of Matlock and a fan of Andy Griffith, I was interested in purchasing this set. The price was right and twelve episodes seemed a reasonable purchase. The set was excellent almost every episode could be considered a ""Greatest"" episode. Whoever selected the episodes did a fantastic job. Only ""The Matchmaker"" in my opinion was weak, with a bit too much of a comedy aspect to the episode. Having said that the rest of the shows selected were outstanding murder mysteries and courtroom drama. I hope they do a few more ""Greatest Cases"".",1431475200,3,549,4.729166666666667
