7989500,3,B0000950Y4,"Okay, everybody who has any interest in A&A knows about it being started by two White men (Gosden and Correll) in Blackface and later hiring real Black actos for the 12950s TV show. With that said, on to the movie itself.
Simply put, it's not that good by any standards. There are a few midly amusing minutes of A&A doing some of their standard schtick such as ""Mulsifyin and Revidin"" and ""Phone Call to Ruby"" (as well as the tire changing routine that would later appear on the TV show). But aisde from this and the priceless footage of the Duke Ellington Band, FORGET IT! This early sound film is as dry as toast! A draggy love story not involving the prinicipal characters also helps slow things down like molasses in January. This film was so bad that even Gosden and Correll themselves have gone on record as dismissing it as junk and Charles Correll's son has recently said that his father hated it so much that he forbade his son from watching it! He had a smart daddy.",1090022400,6,976,4.4581005586592175
