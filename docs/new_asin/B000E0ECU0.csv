2476055,5,B000E0ECU0,"This mosaic comedy-drama tells the story of a La Ronde-like circle of romantic adventures and failed affairs centered around a songwriter named Carroll Barber (Keith Carradine) and his father Carl Barber (Denver Pyle). There is a trail of Carroll's past relationship spread throughout the city of Los Angeles. Barber is an aloof womanizer who cannot commit to any relationship, and is used to illustrate the loneliness of Los Angeles big-city life. Among the women in his life are Ann Goode (Sally Kellerman), a lonely real estate agent, Karen Hood (Geraldine Chaplin), a Valley housewife addicted to taxi rides, Linda Murray (Sissy Spacek), a woman prone to vacuuming in the nude and Nona Bruce (Lauren Hutton), the snapshot-taking mistress of a wealthy man",1172793600,26,758,5.221311475409836

A solid cast, an early film by an outstanding director, like it or not, it's a historically important movie for film appreciation alone.  It makes no sense that something which annually pops up on IFC and other places isn't on DVD.  Some kind of rights dispute?

2476060,5,B000E0ECU0,"The memory of this movie has haunted me since the one and only time I saw it when it was released. And now I own it! I was born and raised in LA, and in 1976 I was in the same age range as most of the characters in the film. Rudolf examined and presented the zeitgeist with skill, beauty, honesty and aplomb: each actor, sequence, scene and story were spot-on and resonated because they represented what was actually happening at that time and in that unique place. Seeing the young Lauren Hutton, Harvey Keitel, Keith Carradine, Sissy Spacek, Sally Kellerman, and Geraldine Chaplin in all their glossy beauty was just as thrilling as it was when the film was new. Is it for everyone? Probably not. But a truly worthwhile glimpse of the ennui and trendy decadence of that time. Each shot is a miracle of composition. (Richard Baskin's music does get a little wearing.) And a big shout-out to Viveca Lindfors - a  force of nature as Susan.",1423526400,,938,4.517647058823529

2476066,4,B000E0ECU0,"This fills in a major hole in film history.  Is this a great film?  Oh heck no, I have no real idea what it's trying say or what was accomplished by making it, but never mind.  It's a early film by a notable film maker, the cast is deep with great performers, and there's even a few interesting scenes . . . and a lot of driving around, standing around and lying around.  And yet, every time this thing appears on IFC or wherever (not often recently), I watch it from the opening notes to that last still of Carradine looking at the camera like, what did you want from me, anyway?  I don't know, but this movie belongs in every serious film buff's collection.  Now it's mine.",1372464000,2,675,4.234375
2476067,5,B000E0ECU0,"Long unavailable, Welcome To L.A. was one of those films that, if you had seen it, you wanted to see it again to verify if your initial affection for the film stood up over time.  It definitely does for me.  Richard Baskin's score holds up well, and defines the characters and the setting beautifully.  Short on plot, but long and rich on character study, the film presents a wonderful ensemble of people with different degrees of isolation and sadness, all trying to connect meaningfully.  Keith Carradine is a standout in his low-key way, and Geraldine Chaplin nearly steals the film with her particular flavor of crazy, but each of the characters is compelling, played by young stars Harvey Keitel, Sissy Spacek, Lauren Hutton and established veterans Denver Pyle, Viveca Lindfors and the radiant but desperate Sally Kellerman.  John Considine is the one throwaway part included just for numerical balance.  I'm delighted to revisit this film, to test my memory and find that my initial fondness for Rudolph's debut is wholly justified.

2476071,5,B000E0ECU0,"In 1973 or '74 I was considering a move from Holland, MI where I grew up, to San Francisco, a city and a coast of the country I'd never been to. By 1976 I was living in Seattle, saw the film Welcome to LA, and six or seven month's later I was living in Los Angles.

Los Angeles in 1977 was everything I'd hoped for, and then some, usually with mostly sunny skies and lots of interesting people to watch and interact with. For a 25 year old male who was recently coming out of the closet, LA, the beaches, the sun, the party atmosphere that was the mid-late 70's, (early 80's), it was nirvana.

Bottom line: I enjoyed this movie very much.

2476072,2,B000E0ECU0,"Considering the people who made this film (which I have tried to find or even a showing), I was expecting something as great as the work they have done on other projects. Maybe it's dated and I've seen the message too many times since, but I was very disappointed. I could go on scene by scene, but I will spare you that. Even the song (which I first found pleasant and haunting),eventually made me yell in my head ""STOP ALREADY!"".  I wish I had seen this when it was released - maybe I would of viewed it a lost treasure.",1334188800,,522,4.22
2476073,5,B000E0ECU0,"If you happen to live or spend some time in Los Angeles, California, you develop all kinds of feelings in regards to this one special city. In my case, this feeling has varied depending on my mood or a particular time where something alters the dynamic of the city. I'm sure that producer Robert Altman (yes, the famous movie director) and writer-director Alan Rudolph felt something about being in L.A. that motivated them to make ""Welcome to L.A.,"" a fascinating and quite unique look at the City of the Angels.

There are so many things that can be written about Los Angeles, really, most of them centered on Hollywood. The stories that Rudolph glued together for his film are, in fact, related to show business, music being the background for the script. The main character is Carroll Barber (Keith Carradine), who doesn't talk much, but commands the screen with no effort. Carroll is in town to write the lyrics for an album by Eric Wood (Richard Baskin). While in Los Angeles, he meets his father Carl (Denver Pyle), a successful business man, who heads Barber Dairy Industries, and who is not happy that Carroll did not follow his footsteps. In the meanwhile, and with lots of time to kill, Carroll gets lucky with the ladies, who fall for him with no effort, too. His housekeeper (Sissy Spacek) likes to vacuum-clean topless, his real-state agent (Sally Kellerman) is desperate for an adventure, the album's photographer (Lauren Hutton) is always ready for a one-night stand, and his agent (Viveca Lindfords) is aging without love. Yet, the woman that steals Carroll's heart or libido is Karen Hood (the wonderful Geraldine Chaplin), who happens to be married to Ken (Harvey Keitel). Karen is not happy in her marriage, and thinks that she is going to die (I don't think I have very long to live"").

""Welcome to L.A."" takes another interesting look at Los Angeles, a city with a lot of ambitious people that are craving to be famous and many other that are lonely, like in the case of this film. The story is also continuously aided by Baskin's singing, with lyrics mostly related to the characters and the city in general. In the end, one of the lessons from the film, as Kellerman tells Carradine, is that, ""Day dreams and traffic - that was Los Angeles is all about."" And, if you happen to like nudity, I guarantee that you will never forget Geraldine Chaplin's famous scene almost at the end of the movie. This film is part of the MGM Limited Edition Collection and is only produced by demand. (USA, 1976, color, 103 mins).

2476074,5,B000E0ECU0,"A dreamy stream-of-consciousness movie about a tangle of romantic relationships in 1970s L.A., a place where everyone seems to be living a life of quiet desperation while searching for the next hookup.  In terms of being an awesome film backdrop, L.A. often lags behind cities like NYC and San Francisco, but this movie manages to make it look like a dreamscape best viewed at 3 am while slightly stoned. This movie came out just a few years after Altman's ""Nashville"", and it too is very Altmanesque.  Interesting to see Keith Carradine appearing as yet another womanizing musician but far more fleshed-out and human of a character, interacting with Geraldine Chaplin who plays a Valley housewife very unlike her annoying ""Nashville"" character. The soundtrack is also a classic example of lush period singer-songwriter gems. So glad to see this film is now available on DVD.",1321833600,5,875,5.069444444444445
2476075,5,B000E0ECU0,"I lived in Los Angeles since 1978  sigh....the 70's!!!) till 5 months ago * sob * and to me, this movie CAPTURES the aura, the sensibility, the moodiness the fears the loneliness, neediness, manipulations, and cut throat using that is the deep and profound epitomy of the City of Angels! I adore adore adore this movie! If you have ANY love of Los Angeles this movie is for you.
Please watch it more than once  I have seen my well worn and hyper stretched VHS tape countless times and love each scene even more) ...as the characters, strange and weird, get more understandable each time. The music is bizarre, Richard Baskin  of Baskin and Robbins, his dad) is nauseatingly obnoxious and perfect in this underlying part and his music flows under the movie like a dark strange blood...his voice is good, the musicians are real studio musicians  he too, I believe he was Barbra Streisand's boyfriend at this time) ...Keith Carradine, a multi talent in his own right...actor, songwriter, singer, painter....is perfect perfect perfect as the cold icy stranger, the user, the self centered artiste who is above all the even colder LA manipulations...Cissy Spacek, so young and bubbly as the ingenue with a mind like a trap...on and on...this movie is priceless and perfect. Sally Kellerman as the gorgeous neurotic, with the philandering hubby, trying to find herself...so scared...Geraldine Chaplin, Harvey Keitel...a couple full of love full of hate connecting, parting....
They DO NOT make movies like this at all...it is a work of true art with exceptional acting, unique writing , and cinematography...the scenes in cars...SO Los Angeles.
Not that I am the expert, but I am someone who has lived and deeply deeply loved that city. This is a particularly wonderful strange dark movie that gets better and better each watching. I can not recommend it enough.",1320105600,14,1856,4.97741935483871

STOP PRESS !!! - YOU CAN BUY IT NOW - WE DID IT!!!! HOORAY !!!! WELL DONE EVERYONE WHO VOTED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN !!!

A wonderful tribute to one of the world's most underrated but most familiar cities. You know it even if you have not been there. I would wager that more films are set in LA than any other city on the planet. Its combination of tall palm trees, hills and mountains, beaches and stylish skyscrapers make it visually truly stunning. But enough of the travelogue!! The film has a wonderfully atmospheric quality - very 1970s (in a good way) - and the actors never put a foot wrong. I love French films and there is something Gallic about the direction. Another French connection is Geraldine Chaplin, who numbers a couple of films from that country in her distinguished career.
I won't tell you any more or I might spoil things, just go and buy this today on DVD - and enjoy!!! [Or maybe not. One little problem - you can't buy it on DVD because it is unavailable. This is ridiculous. If you would like to have this movie re-released, please mark this review as ""helpful"". ]

8103093,5,B000E0ECU0,"I never saw this film until recently. I am just now beginning to appreciate the films of Alan Rudolph. I love this film, now having watched it twice. I love the look of L.A. here and the assorted lonely characters who interact with each other in some way. Some of the reviewers have been pretty negative, but I am not one of them. I also purchased Choose Me, a later film of his and that one impressed me even more. Lesley Ann Warren was at her peak with that film, probably her greatest performance ever And I like the fact that he uses the same actors in his films, particularly Keith Carradine and Genevieve Bujold, both of whom are wonderful actors.",1520208000,,653,4.404958677685951
8103094,3,B000E0ECU0,"I've watched this film twice. The first time I saw it years ago, I was impressed by the feelings of loneliness and yearning that it gave. Alan Rudolph has a talent for ambience and feeling and, maybe, it's his strongest attribute. The film's about a group of people in LA, who are lonely and searching for connection. Sexual relations and extramarital affairs aren't motivated so much by passion or love or lust as by a need for a balm for unhappiness.

The second time I watched it, I liked it less and not more. The main problem is with Carroll Barber (Keith Carradine), who isn't likable. All the women are attracted to him for some inexplicable reason and, after a one-night stand, he leaves them hurt and disappointed. The film tries to portray him with great honesty, especially when he looks at the camera, but his sincerity is phony - it's just a way to bed more women. There's a moment when you think he and Lauren Hutton will have a true connection, but it leads nowhere.

I liked Sissy Spacek and Lauren Hutton, but neither character was developed well. It was unclear to me what role Lauren Hutton played. She's a photographer named Nona Bruce, who documents the scenes and people in the story, but she isn't given much else to do.

Richard Baskin's music provides the Chorus that holds the movie together. Some songs work well to provide moodiness and commentary on the characters, but the music gets repetitive. At the same time, the story and characters get repetitive and one-note. Sally Kellerman, Viveca Lindfors, and Geraldine Chaplin all seem like the same character by the end.

Harvey Keitel is also unlikable as Kenneth Hood. He plays an ambitious assistant to Carl Barber (Denver Pyle) and he's fallen out of love with his wife, Geraldine Chaplin. Keitel, too, comes off as phony when he attempts to reconcile with his wife. He delivers lines to her that he said to his mistress, Sissy Spacek. As Geraldine Chaplin says at the beginning of the film, everyone gets deceived. Maybe that's the point of the film, but that's not enough to make this a satisfactory experience.",1509408000,,2095,4.7315068493150685
