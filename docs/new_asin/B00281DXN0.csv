8355413,1,B00281DXN0,"total waste time.  The movie was substandard production quality. The movie was unorganized.
The narrator rambled....talked about several subjects and never connected them.  Horrible.
we turnerd it off midway through. Don't waste your money like we did!",1355616000,,252,5.783783783783784
8355414,4,B00281DXN0,I thought it was quite interesting and not enough people actually see this sort of thing to know what is really happening around us at this point in time.,1351123200,2,154,4.344827586206897
8355415,1,B00281DXN0,"I'm tired of paying for movies that have interesting promotional tags, but are nothing more than a badly video taped conference.",1350777600,,128,5.142857142857143
8355416,1,B00281DXN0,"If I could have rated it a NO Star I would have. Terrible script, sorry volume control, no information that isn't avail. online.  Would LOVE to have my money back so I could rent something worthwhile.

Dont waste your money.

Go to Netflix and see more, better, NOW and free.",1343952000,,275,4.46
8355417,1,B00281DXN0,"I have read many books and watched more documentaries on this topic than I can count. By far, this film (if u wanna call it that) is nothing more than a commercial to get the viewer interested in buying dvd's from reality media (or is it reality entertainment??). I have NEVER posted a comment online about anything....until now! My aim is to warn people this film is horrible!",1337904000,4,377,4.5588235294117645
8355418,1,B00281DXN0,"One star is too high here. With very few lights in this speech except that there is a hidden agenda, which is agreed upon, but he basicly relies on research from the burnt Library of Alexandria. If this is to be taken seriously, there needs to be more research than this. Just using Library of Alexandria to base attacks on problems is not researching nor is it giving your audience any direct substance. If research is not improved, he is doing more harm than good. Stay away from this guy.",1333756800,2,491,4.466666666666667
8355419,5,B00281DXN0,"Myself among many others have researched these topics for years. Ian has put it all together brilliantly.  those who knock this are the brainwashed uninformed who unfortunately are aiding and abetting this evil.  what is needed is becoming both aware of that which has and is being done to humanity,  to wake up to the truth, and to unite. Only then will we stand a chance. Take the time to research and open your minds. We have been lied to and manipulated since birth through Mainstream media, Television, movies, education etc.  we are living in a destructive and false paradigm. a paradigm which is destructive to our soul and individualism.
wake up humanity, time is running out.
I highly recommend this book.",1332633600,3,714,4.827868852459017
8355420,1,B00281DXN0,"This is a low budget film of a speech by Ian Crane. I have to admit that after 20 minutes I felt it wasn't worth watching any longer. His commentary floats from topic to topic, from Aspartame to extinct religions without really giving many details. Mostly I found his words to be inflammatory attacks by a Brit blaming the Bush Administration for the woes of the world, demonizing individuals without giving much time to any single one of them, and overall, highly bigoted against Jews and Christians.  He seemed to self-righteously enjoy attacking the God of Israel Isaac and Jacob, basically implying God is a thief and a liar. If you are quick to anger and if making generalizations against entire nations of people, bigotry, and small-mindedness are your thing, you'll love this video.",1317945600,12,789,4.888059701492537
8355421,4,B00281DXN0,"The ""hidden agenda"" referred to is generally the politics of war post-9/11. This is basically a tape of a speech at a symposium (Glastobury, 2006), but Ian Crane is such an animated speaker that if you're into the material it's totally worth watching.",1252368000,5,251,4.8604651162790695
8355422,4,B00281DXN0,"The conspire fans of the world are going wild with the Mayan 2012 predictions.  The list goes on and on of world events supposedly connected to negative occult type energy.  Are events coming as predicted in the 2012 prophecy? Believe it or not, the possibilities are intriguing.  What are we headed for and is it possible that there are powerful groups/individuals that know our future.  Movie is entertaining and actually frightening.  Worth your time and money!!",1250208000,9,465,5.065789473684211
