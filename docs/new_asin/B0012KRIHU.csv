8246540,5,B0012KRIHU,"This is one of the best pinky violence films ever, better than the first Hanzo film, made by Kenji Misumi in 1972. Yasuzo Masumura did a fantastic job directing and also with the incredible story. The music is superb and adds a lot. All the female actors are amazing and sexy. The performance by  Shintaro Katsu is tremendous and extremely tough! The film flows perfectly as the plot progress to the final climax. Excellent cult film, highly entertaining! I bought the European version by Eureka (great transfers).",1394236800,2,514,4.908045977011494
8246541,3,B0012KRIHU,"I lived in Japan for 9 years (1960-1964 and 1968-1973).  I always enjoyed chamballah movies and the Zato-Ichi series especially.  However, the premise of sanctioned rape, no matter the kind of woman, is abhorrent to me and that is an over-riding theme of the ""Hanzo"" series.  The seller provided the requested item in good condition and in a timely manner.  It is the content of the film in which I am disappointed.",1368748800,,415,4.722222222222222
8246542,3,B0012KRIHU,It doesn`t take long to see the predictable turns in this movie. Hanzo the Snare shows some cruel parts that may be very hard to watch for Western Audiences. This movie is not the worst but is definitely not the best either. The only thing genius about it is the torture.,1292025600,,271,4.333333333333333
8246543,4,B0012KRIHU,"Once again Hanzo Itami, a.k.a. Hanzo the Razor, along with his two men Devil-fire and Viper, are in search of Japan's worst criminals, government conspiracies, and women with ""information"".  Before you can say ""penis mutilation"", Hanzo is ""tenderizing his meat"" with a wooden mallet, and sexing up a bamboo bag filled with hot, uncooked rice - it's just like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hanzo-The-Razor-Sword-of-Justice/dp/B001B8MLS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hanzo The Razor Sword of Justice</a>.  We also get to see more of Hanzo's ""stabbin' cabin"", which has an inauspicious double-meaning and makes McCauley Caulkin's house in Home Alone seem infant safe.  He even pulls off the fake seppuku trick again, this time with a watermelon.  Awesome!

In this intricate investigation, while chasing simple criminals, Hanzo confronts and disrespects a lord, Treasurer Okubo, who Hanzo regards as a cheap ornament.  Protecting Okubo is a deadly fencing instructor who comes off tough, but there is no ambiguity about the fact that his machismo will later cost him his life.  Nonetheless, after some capitulation to all involved, despite Hanzo's obvious disdain of status, he's allowed to continue his duties as a law enforcer.

In no time at all, and with very little transition, Hanzo finds himself at a murder scene.  After mere seconds, Hanzo recognizes that the dead girl's nipples are dark; therefore, she's a slut.  Obviously.  Immediately afterwards, he begins his investigation by giving her two-finger necrogynecological exam.  Clearly, he deduces that she had an abortion.  This leads him to a Voodoo abortion clinic with a nude, female ""doctor"" - reminded me of a southern Baptist snake charmer - who performs her medical procedures with what amounts to a large coat hanger.  Naturally, she's succumbs to the Penis of Truth, telling Hanzo the dead girl's name, and leading him to the girl's home.

While interrogating grieving parents, Hanzo realizes the girl had been going to Kaizan Temple, a convent of sorts.  Once there, he discovers that an attractive, bald priestess has been entertaining wealthy merchants by bringing in the virgin daughters of local families for whatever carnal desires the merchants may have.  Hanzo walks into the middle of one such encounter where a young girl is naked, strapped to a post, and being beaten.  Naturally, Hanzo finds this completely unacceptable; so, he beats and threatens the men there.  The Priestess, however, soon gets the Penis of Truth via the hanging sex net at the Hanzo love shack where he delivers the line, ""You saw hell before, now you'll see heaven.""

Somewhere in all this depravity, Hanzo uncovers a scheme within the treasury to devalue currency.  It's actually a pretty decent plot.  But he also manages to find time to stop Japan's wickedest thief, Shobei Hamajima, a man responsible for mass robbery and slaughter.  The Penis of Truth makes one more appearance where he rapes a woman he's protecting from the possibility of being raped by Hamajima.  Like the others, she eventually loves it.

Along with a soundtrack that appropriately sounds like it's straight from a porno, The Snare nails its Hanzo predecessor's theme.  It's an extension of the original piece, with deep concepts and a penetrating commitment to justice, all under the blanket of the 70s exploitation genre.  Disturbingly awesome.",1232841600,4,3419,5.40188679245283
8246544,4,B0012KRIHU,"In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hanzo-The-Razor-Sword-of-Justice/dp/B001B8MLS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hanzo The Razor: Sword of Justice</a>, Shintaro Katsu showed us that he is one sick bastard.  And if you're here, then you obviously liked it.  Pervert.  While ""The Snare"" gives you too much of the same, it makes up for it with a commandingly exuberant performance from Katsu-sama, some outstanding grindhouse humor, and plenty of new heroic depravity and exploits for a character that I've become strangely attached to, in spite of my disgust at his propensity for raping any woman who ends up in his general vicinity.  I suppose all's fair in exploitation cinema, and after all, they do end up enjoying it.

Okay, on Hanzo The Razor's agenda for this this installment:  Deliberately insult a powerful lord by busting up his procession while chasing bumbling ex-con servants.  Check.  Break up a nude lesbian abortion ring.  Check. Break up an S&M auction right afterwards while dressed ridiculously.  Check.  Cut down multitudes of loser henchmen. Check.  Use a watermelon for a seppuku prank.  Check.  Revisit genital mutiliation and suspended net rape sequences. Check and double-check.  Torture a bald (but still hot) priestess until she passes out and then stick her in the ol' net for the Hanzo Special.  Check.  Rape girl at treasury for appearing nervous at having a rapist staying in her room and refer to it as ""The Treatment"".  Check.  Pit the wits of Japan's greatest officer against Japan's worst thief in order to regain insulted lord's favor.  Check.  Freakin' OWN.  Check.  When offered your pick any reward one could desire by said lord, request his head. Check and OWNED!!!

As you can see, there is a lot offered by this sequel.  Where in ""Sword of Justice"" Hanzo often played the fox used his wits (and his penis) to attain victory, in ""The Snare"" he is a bull in everybody's china shop.  Katsu in=s on fire and puts on a performance worthy of the immortal Toshiro Mifune  here.  Seeing him snarl and sneer in the face of his superiors is a joy and in spite of his vile proclivities towards the fairer sex, the way Hanzo handles each situation is worthy of worship.  When you consider the chauvinistic wallowing of the Bond franchise, it really makes the Hanzo The Razor films more fun.  Really, the two characters are quite similar; Hanzo just chooses the grindhouse as his house whereas Bond goes the populist route.  But at the end of the day, it is The Razor's dedication to defending the common and the downtrodden that makes him an enduring and heroic figure; the rest is just sleazy 70's exploitation badness.  The central conflict of ""The Snare"" is the lords of the treasury diluting the gold coins at the mint, thus increasing their own wealth while raising prices and starving the peasants in the process. See? Trash cinema is fun AND educational.  Thanks for the economics lesson, Hanzo-san.  I wonder what he'd do to Bush and Cheney.

""The Snare"" features less impressive action sequences than it's predecessor, a few of the sequences from the first film are redundant, and the funky soundtrack is replaced with some straight weirdness, but this is still a sequel that is very nearly as good as the original, and has better pacing.  If you liked the first film, you will like this one as well.  You may even prefer it.  When it comes to 70's chanbara action with a perverse streak a mile across, you just can't do better than a Hanzo The Razor flick.",1228953600,,3535,5.0
