PLOT

THIS ONE TAKES UP WHERE SARKAR LEAVES OFF WITH HIS SON COMING INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH HIS SOMEWHAT AILING FATHER. SARKAR IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE AND KICKING. Seeing his son into his heritage side by side quietly backing him . This is a great subtle mafia movie with just the right amount of drama, violence ,conniving and revenge to keep it going forward to the breathless end. If I were you I wouldn't p*** him off. Best watch it then..",1337817600,4,583,4.596153846153846
8290430,3,B001CZ549E,"While 'Sarkar Raj' is the sequel to 'Sarkar,' which was based on 'The Godfather,' this film was not based on 'The Godfather Part II,' but there are still many allusions to it. In this sequel, the father, Sarkar (Amitabh Bachchan), is alive and well and calling the shots, but he's preparing to hand over the reins to his son, Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan), who's now deeply entrenched in the family business he once eschewed. As the story progresses, Shankar becomes less of a clear-cut surrogate for Michael and more of a curious amalgamation of all three Corleone brothers. Enter Anita (played by Abhishek's wife Aishwarya Rai)--and she's no compliant Kay, but tough and sharp, playing with the big boys in her power suits--Shankar's equal in every way. The characters are fascinating and the performances top-notch, but the plot--involving shady businessmen, corrupt politicians, and gangsters jockeying to build a lucrative power plant--is as dry as day-old toast. The end is somewhat redeeming, though, as the director leaves his characters in a shockingly different place than Coppola did in the second 'Godfather' installment. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1255392000,4,1366,5.974489795918367

The principal actors are back, specifically, real-life father and son actors Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan. Gorgeous Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek's new bride, jumps on board, as well. As in SARKAR, there aren't any musical numbers here, or lowbrow comedy or much of a romance. You're supposed to take this movie very seriously.

Not a crime lord as much as an unofficial but very influential governing power in his own right, Subhash Nagare (Amitabh Bachchan) has ruled and controlled the destinies of his people for decades. Much like in THE GODFATHER, the citizens of Mumbai approached Subhash for a solution or an arbitration to their difficulties. SARKAR told of Subhash's time coming to an end as an active power and his passing the torch to his son, Shankar (Abhishek). SARKAR RAJ opens a few years later, with Shankar Nagare having settled into his new role, changed and hardened and more decisive. Yet he still very much cares for the welfare of his people.

Entrepreneur Anita Rajan (Aishwarya Rai) heads up the sweeping Sheppard power plant project, of which proposal she presents to Shankar. However, the optimum site for the power plant lies in rural Maharashtra, which means that 40,000 villagers would have to be displaced for the plant to be built. But Shankar is quick to see the long term advantages for the ever struggling populace of Maharashtra. He talks his reluctant father into consenting to the project, and off Shankar goes to talk to the villagers.

But he soon meets resistance in the form of local dissident Sanjay Somji, who has his own daunting connections. Somji uses verbal histrionics to sway the masses to his side, and the violent demonstrations promptly begin. The Nagares' power base has always been rooted in the high regard and trust accorded to them by the common people. Insidiously, an unknown agent starts to whittle away at that power base. And I think I'll stop right there, except to say that all this stuff so far is only the tip of the iceberg. There are some serious machinations going down in this film.

First off, while SARKAR RAJ isn't quite as good as SARKAR, it's still dang watchable. Especially if you've seen SARKAR and are curious about the Nagares' further exploits. It's a fine crime drama and political thriller, even with its slow spots. SARKAR RAJ explores the nature of power - the wielding of it, the erosion it has on the soul, the jealousies it instills in others. The Nagares have remained true to their ideals, even if it means that those ideals are kept alive thru ruthless acts. In a gray world, the Nagares are who the common people turn to, for succor and for judgment. That is power, willingly granted.

SARKAR RAJ boasts stylish filmmaking, polished cinematography, confident acting. The movie looks very good on screen, awash in sepia tones and in brooding shadows, most of which dramatically frame the many close-ups of the Bachchans. Speaking of whom, the Bachchans show off their considerable acting chops, with Abhishek very intense and his dad masterfully taking over in the film's last half hour or so. Aishwarya Rai (it's weird adding a Bachchan at the end of her name) is decent for most of the film, but really gets good in the latter stages. Her last scene, as she comfortably asks for tea in the Nagare household, helps to set up a possible sequel. By the way, this is the first film which co-stars Aish and Abhishek since they got married.

Okay, now the downside. SARKAR RAJ is two hours and five minutes long, and, at times, the film's length presses on you. The story really takes its sweet time developing. Furthermore, the soundtrack tends to go overboard with the ominous ""Govinda, Govinda"" chorus. After a while, you'll probably get tired of it. There are several scenes between Abhishek and Aishwarya which come off as trite, specifically those dealing with Shankar confiding to Anita, where you could see the subtext of Anita beginning to feel sappy emotions. All in all, the romantic subplot between Shankar and Anita is kind of kicked to the curb. Come to think of it, the same goes for the relationship between Shankar and his wife.

I'll say, though, that the ending is very satisfying, with the wrathful Sarkar putting the pieces of the conspiracy together and then proceeding to get his sweet vengeance on. I say, three and a half stars for SARKAR RAJ, as again the Bachchans demonstrate why they are the preeminent acting family in India.",1217894400,3,4883,5.179974651457541
