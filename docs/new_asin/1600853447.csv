7800117,3,1600853447,Awesome content. Display font is rather small for the thumbnail view of the magazines. Can't find any options to adjust the size. Can't be hard for the programmers these days to fix.  What size monitors are these people using any way?,1396137600,,234,4.7073170731707314
7800118,5,1600853447,"I've often attempted to save issues of great magazines I acquired but every time I moved they were too difficult to keep. Now comes these DVD archives with every issue, in this case 30 years of issues, on one simple DVD with every page of every issue, all the full color images and articles and every topic searchable. I'm going through each issue just as if it was a hard copy, and when I see a topic I really like I save it in my bookmarks. This is so much better than piles of magazines around the house I couldn't be happier. I ordered the 1981-2010 DVD but the seller sent me the newer one through 2011, one extra year of great articles.",1329091200,2,642,4.227642276422764
7800119,5,1600853447,Knowledge is the most important tool in your toolbox so this DVD was a no-brainer. I know Fine Homebuilding will be releasing an archive that goes up to 2011 in December but it's more expensive and I'm hoping they'll have a 2011-only DVD so I can supplement the archive I have.,1316736000,,277,4.450980392156863

No more piles of magazines collecting dust or tripping over. Get this product, you'll be happy you did!",1314403200,,251,4.478260869565218
