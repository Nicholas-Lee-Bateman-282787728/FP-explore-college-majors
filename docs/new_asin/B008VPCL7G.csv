5185673,1,B008VPCL7G,"McCartney seems to purposely be terrible around every turn. He mutters intentional lines of awful dialogue to his girlfriend like, ""Just roll with it,"" and, ""Our love is just exploding,"" while his poor attempts at being terrified will have you laughing uncontrollably. The entire movie has this basic formula of somebody disappearing, everyone scrambling around with a flashlight searching for them, and the camera bouncing around as you're unable to distinguish just what in the blue hell is going on before it happens to somebody else and it starts all over again.

""Chernobyl Diaries"" is actually at its best when nobody is talking. When they first arrive in the abandoned city of Pripyat, it's completely silent. The dilapidated buildings, remaining carnival equipment, and the sound of nothing is the movie at its strongest. Unfortunately these moments never last long as somebody always has to chime in with something sarcastic or completely obvious like, ""I thought you said this place was deserted!"" Serves you right for thinking, ""extreme tourism,"" sounded like a good idea.

Promising moments of tension and an ominous atmosphere are completely ruined once Uri (Dimitri Diatchenko) and Chris (Jesse McCartney) run off into the night together. That's when the inconsistencies start piling up and characters throw even the slightest sign of logic out the window. You never do get a good glimpse at just what this radiation has turned these people into. When the action gets heavy, it's bogged down with poor lighting and what seems like a cameraman with ADD that can't decide what he should film. What you do get to see though looks like people running around with pantyhose over their faces and something waddling on the ground that looks like a human turtle on speed.

""Chernobyl Diaries"" is hilarious because of all the stupid things these six tourists do and say once things get heavy. Shaky cam once again contributes to ruining what begins as something semi-promising, but even steady camera work wouldn't have cured a poorly developed concept and under par acting. ""Chernobyl Diaries"" is just senseless, idiotic, and pointless. If a horror movie is going to be chock full of people making stupid decisions, it would be nice if they were at least somewhat logical. Having your leg mangled by mysterious creatures or high levels of radiation claiming your eyesight doesn't sound so bad when your brain cells are at risk.",1337904000,3,2433,5.0927318295739346
5185674,3,B008VPCL7G,"Interesting premise. I watched this mainly out of an interest in ruined/abandoned places (ruin porn). It has some flaws, such as the (I won't spoil it) ""bad guys"" not being interested in wedding rings, cell phones, etc of the victims, but seemingly able to sabotage a car's engine. The blonde actress with the big melons has hardly any lines, and it's good because she can't really act. I like the setting for this movie (in reality filmed in Hungary and Serbia) and set-up, but it's fairly predictable overall (opening montage so you connect with characters who get picked off slowly as movie progresses). Some jumpy, almost-scary moments. Worthwhile but don't expect greatness.

I can sit though any movie and find something I can enjoy about it, but this movie had no real endearing qualities. The story was bland but had so much potential.

5185688,4,B008VPCL7G,"Do not expect a true visit, even extreme, of Chernobyl. The film was shot in Serbia and in Hungary. There are so many dead cities in the world and anyway most scenes were shot either in some incognito landscape that could be anywhere and in ruined mostly underground places, constructions, tunnels and other structures that probably were made of cardboard or plywood.

It is a horror movie using a real historic drama, the explosion of Chernobyls nuclear plant, as a setting both in time and place. All the rest is fantasy, subnormal fantasy actually. Could there be any survivor to the catastrophe? Apart from a few insects like cockroaches that are immune to radiations, immune though not entirely indifferent, since radiations may cause some mutations from one generation to the next and since insects are naturally short-lived they may have five or six generations per year, good morning mutations then, apart from some insects then, other animal species that are rather a lot longer-lived, survival and even mutations are more than problematic. Nuclear explosions of that type leads to massive death. The survivors were irradiated and then developed serious diseases like cancer, leukemia and some other ailments that are deadly, more or less fast.

So the main idea of the film that humans and other mammal species actually did survive is hardly believable and whats more nature cannot keep more individuals than the surrounding resources can permit. It is thus highly improbable that great numbers of mutated humans could survive in such conditions and they would have to adapt to radiations and irradiated plants and animals. Yet nature can always survive any catastrophe with time. It is highly possible that vegetal life will be the first one to mutate and take the territory over. Then water animals, fish and other species living in water would adapt or mutate rather fast and thus survive like insects. It is a lot more problematic for mammals. So the only objective of the film is to frighten the gall out of you. It succeeds or it does not according to your sensitiveness: not everyone reacts the same way to such simple frightening visions.

But the film is interesting to show some human characteristics not in Chernobyl but in everyday life, characteristics that are exploited in this film for commercial reasons.

First it shows very well that in any situation, even the worst and most desperate, there will be a Yuri or a Smith or a Dupont who will take advantage of it and try to make money from it. It will be all the easier since there is an audience for any extreme endeavor or adventure, in fact for extreme anything. Then the second remark is that since an audience does exist and has always existed such morbid and mortiferous subjects, provided they have a horror oriented side, and it is the case here, will be highly welcome in the B-movie industry: low cost and good profit.

What are people afraid of? The answer is simple. Abnormal and aggressive beings, be they living dead or zombies or monstrous animals in size or in voraciousness. People are afraid of bears, wolves, wild dogs (dingoes in Australia) and of course the whole wild feline family. The film exploits wild dogs, wolves and bears. Perfect, plus some monstrous mutated and mutating river animals, mostly fish. And of course some human mutated and mutating survivors, hence living zombies.

The third element is about how such a territory can be protected. In fact, it cant really since animals will migrate anyway just like radiations, fish down rivers, wild mammals in forests and even living zombies will try to get out. So the army will have to be there all around, but you cannot really close a vast territory, twenty kilometers in radius, more than one thousand two hundred and fifty square kilometers. The film goes slightly beyond and they pretend that some of the human survivors are kept in some reserve and fed with extreme tourists the soldiers recuperate on the site. That is not supposed to surprise anyone since we are in Ukraine and at most they have been well trained in inhumanity by the Russians know up to 1990 as the Soviets.

The anti-Soviet, anti-Russian and anti-Ukrainian aspect is not supposed to be a surprise to us since the West lives on a strong bias against anything Russian, and at times anything Slavic or Slavonic. Only the Catholic or Protestant Slavs can be excused, hence the Poles. And maybe the Slovaks and the Czechs. All the others are not even decent enough to have a standard Christian religion and they live on some Ukrainian, Russian, and Bulgarian Orthodox religion whose may patriarch is in Moscow. This anti-Russian and anti-Slavic bias is very short-sighted, but it is what is going to bring Trump down, with real news as much as fake news, since with him whats true is fake and whats fake is true. Enjoy the nice very tame horror true story: it was in fact a lot worse in reality than what is shown.

5185694,5,B008VPCL7G,"Underrated gem! I RARELY order movies on DVD unless I really like them a lot, and this one fit the bill after first seeing it on TV. This is a tense and suspenful - but not stupid! - hybrid of horror and thriller. A group of tourists go on an 'extreme tourism' tour of Pripyat, the town closest to the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. These tours really do exist. The film did a fantastic job of capturing the creepiness and sadness of an entire city evacuated immediately after the explosion, with residents leaving literally everything they owned behind. People had only minutes to leave their homes and all their possessions in order to avoid fatal radiation poisoning following the disaster. Many still died from the effects. Everything was left behind in what has been a ghost town ever since. I'm from Eastern Europe and am relatively familiar with the Chernobyl disaster. For those who aren't, please read about the incident, it is fascinating. The movie was actually highly accurate in capturing and recreating the scenery (some of it was filmed on site). The unfortunate tourists in the film discover that there are multiple forces to contend with - the radiation, the wild animals (the tour guide mentions that nature is reclaiming its proper place, which is true), and worst of all - the only part that (obviously) isn't factual - the zombie-like creatures that have mutated from normal human beings by living on extremily radioactive territory. As opposed to a lot of stupid horror concepts, this actually seems remotely plausible. Other life forms have adapted to highly toxic and even radioactive environments, so who's to say that humans couldn't also? Sounds silly, I know, but I would venture to say that in theory it is not impossible. Anyway, the fact that real tourists do in fact venture into this territory is dumb, even though I can understand the intrigue. There is no such thing as a 'safe' level of ionizing radiation, and the land will not actually be inhabitable for another 3,000 years. But alas, an industry has cropped up in Ukraine to cater to morbidly curious tourists. Without giving anything away, these tourists learn the hard way exactly how much risk they have taken on after their van is disabled. The tour guide Uri is actually quite hilarious and is one of the highlights of the movie. The entire cast is very effective. I feel that the movie accomplished its goal of being very creepy and tense, while also being respectful to the reality of the Chernobyl tragedy. I highly recommend this film, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1487376000,,2586,4.839729119638826

5185701,3,B008VPCL7G,"This film had a lot of potential to be an insightful and darkly humorous horror or horror comedy film, but it petered out halfway through. It had the potential, especially with the stereotypical characters that seemed to parody themselves (the 20-somethings Wandering Around Europe who fall prey to rubbernecking/disaster tourism, the hilarious Ukrainian stereotypical ex-military tour operator Uri who promises to show them a good time in Pripyat (!), etc).  There was enough gallows humor that I thought the film had enough good starting material to be a self-aware horror or smart horror comedy film.  Although the characters are silly, I did find myself caring about them.  Then, after about 25 minutes, the film started running out of steam (sorry, not intended as a bad reactor pun).

SPOILER alert:

The last 70 minutes (yes, 70) of the film are a variation on the same theme:  To borrow/paraphrase a line from TVtropes.org, *Everything In Pripyat Is Trying To Eat You.* Literally.  This could be a significant message on the part of the filmmakers, a cautionary tale against Western disaster tourism/consumption (ie, the tourists in the film are rubbernecking/consuming Chernobyl, so Chernobyl consumes them). However, although the film starts out parodying the tourists (and ""extreme tourism""), it doesn't appear to actually convey this message by the end.

One humorous/ironic point:  The heroes of the film may be adventure tourists/stalkers, but Pripyat is in fact ""stalking"" them.  To borrow a line from the video game series S.T.A.L.K.E.R., ""Get out of here, stalker,"" indeed.

5185722,1,B008VPCL7G,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Chernobyl Diaries""
(note: there are probably spoilers in here)

1. This movie was written by Oren Peli, who wrote and directed ""Paranormal Activity"" (he is almost single-handedly responsible for the decline of American horror in the past decade to a flood of found-footage film made by people with no budget and no talent).

Here's the plot of the film (stop me if you've already heard this one): a group of college kids are touring Eastern Europe. They decide to deviate from their scheduled activity to sign up for an ""extreme tourism"" trip to the town of Pripyat, Russia. It's a town that was abandoned in 1986, when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, spewing radiation into the atmosphere that is still causing problems today.

So these kids get into a sketchy van with a sketchy driver, and sneak into the sketchy town of Pripyat. It turns out the town isn't abandoned. It's inhabited by people who have been transformed by radiation into mutant cannibals.

2. This movie is not only bad horror, it's bad history. And it's pretty exploitative of a real human disaster.

3. Many things happen in the movie for no reason. For example, while the group is exploring at the top of an abandoned apartment, a CGI bear suddenly runs through the scene. It doesn't attack anybody, and there's no explanation of how or why a huge-ass bear climbed the narrow staircases anyway. It just runs down the hallway and is never seen again.

4. In a pathetic ""deus ex machina"" move, during one of their night-time runs through an abandoned building, they happen to find a map pinned to a wall with guard checkpoints marked on it. It's just a random map hanging on a bare wall that serves no purpose in the movie except to give the group hope that they can survive.

5. Of course we need a random creepy girl, so when the remaining members of the group go outside to figure out their next moves, they suddenly notice that a little girl has appeared, facing opposite them. Of course, they have to approach her. And she never does anything. She just stands there until the gang notices one of their friends is being taken by the mutants, and then they ignore her.

6. The ending is in my Hall of Fame for WTF Stupid Endings.

7. In the movie, Pripyat is officially closed off, and the ""extreme tour guide"" has to get the group to the town through back roads, avoiding security checkpoints.

In real life, there are no ""extreme tours"" of Pripyat or Chernobyl. There are regular tours, widely advertised.

8. In the movie, the characters started reacting to high radiation levels towards the end of the movie. The guy was going blind, and the girl's skin was burning off. That means the radiation level would have to be about the same as when the reactor first blew. That's impossible.

In real life, staying for 10 hours in Pripyat gives you about the same level of radiation as getting an x-ray on your arm.

9. Whether you want a horror movie, or something that can teach you a little about the worst nuclear accident in history, the movie fails miserably on all counts. Do yourself a favor. Instead of watching the movie, get two x-rays. That would be scarier... and more realistic.",1464220800,2,3204,4.639575971731449
5185723,5,B008VPCL7G,Great overall movie,1463961600,,19,5.666666666666667
5185724,4,B008VPCL7G,"I was a little dubious about the idea at first. It's a great concept, but films rarely treat radiation with any degree of realism, so I wasn't sure how this would work out. It ended up being pretty good... I like horror, and this wasn't too intense for my tastes, nor too gory, nor did it rely too much on jump scares. That having been said, there was a little too much plot-induced stupidity, and I feel like the radiation was handled a little inconsistently.

(spoilers)
To a degree, radiation and its effects were basically invoked as the plot demanded. Want an obstacle to keep your characters from getting to their destination too quickly? Have them suddenly run into an area with very strong radiation. We're told that animals are rare due to the radiation, only to run into a bear (in an upper storey apartment!) which honestly just seemed like a contrived excuse for a jump scare. At least the dogs made sense--there are genuinely packs of stray dogs around Chernobyl.

Once the characters decide they want to leave, plot induced stupidity sets in. The only person with any really relevant experiences storms off on his own in the dark--after mentioning that they're safe only as long as they stay in the van--and promptly gets killed. Even after they realize there's something more dangerous out there than dogs, the others act like the van is some kind of safety bubble that nothing can penetrate. There are actual covers on the windows that could have helped conceal them, but they seem to prefer shining bright lights everywhere, yelling loudly, and generally making their presence as obvious as possible. Do people really act like this in real life? One girl even learns much earlier than the others that there are people around... but doesn't bother mentioning this. What gives? She didn't even warn her friends to lock the van doors, and they were still under the impression that the worst thing out there was feral dogs!

My only other complaint is the radiation poisoning victims. As much time as they spent building up the suspense of being chased by these people, I feel like more could have been made of their appearance. When other reviewers call this film a ""Hills Have Eyes"" ripoff, I believe that's why. It is nice that they didn't stretch credibility even further by going overboard with gory makeup, but when you only get like one second's clear view of them, it feels like it ought to be a little less subtle.

I am still giving it four stars because hey, it could definitely have been much worse. I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, or even a mediocre one. I just think it could have been a little bit better.",1462147200,,2636,4.662365591397849

5185745,2,B008VPCL7G,"I would recommend this movie for people who are looking for a cheap thrill and know nothing about Chernobyl.
I will give them props where they're due... They did a nice job replicating the sign at the entrance of Pripyat, and replicating the ferris wheel as well as the bumper cars. But the first mistake, in my opinion was when they showed real footage of Pripyat. It was a nice idea, but when they got to the film site, all the buildings looked nothing like the actual footage. The footage showed tall, thinner buildings and all the ones at the film site were shorter and wider. I'm sure they're are some short, wide buildings somewhere in Pripyat... they should've tried to make them match up.
Secondly, there was just TOO much going on in the movie, in the famously dead city. The dead dog on the porch of a building was a nice touch... Seeing a dead animal in Pripyat is creepy, but gets the idea that animals do creep in every now and again, but the radiation kills them. But to add a bear, birds, dogs, wolves, and a few other animals is just ridiculous. Not to mention these wildlife would show up after the actors would take out the Geiger counter and be like, ""Oh no! The radiation here is worse!""... and cue more wildlife. Realistically, it just doesn't make sense. More radiation would equal less wildlife. I get that it's a movie, but it's ridiculous when you think of where they're supposed to be. The more animals that showed up, the less believable it became. I know movies aren't supposed to be 100% believable, but if you keep the setting KIND OF realistic, that's what makes a good creepy movie. Then there's the humanoid, zombie like things. Again, too much going on here. But if you want to tie it into the actual city you could have exactly 31, since that's the original number of people that died immediately from the reactor explosion... TIE IT IN.
To sum it up... the setting was supposed to be in a dead city. And then they added TONS of wildlife and humanoid, zombie like creatures, to make it one of the liveliest cities there is. I didn't like it. Plus, *SPOILERS* everyone dies. Hardly any resolution there.",1441238400,,2137,4.524547803617571

The premise (abandoned city inhabited by human mutants) was strong but the script itself was weak. Character development was shallow: it was difficult for me to connect with any of them so I didn't feel any twang of sympathy when one (or more) of them died. I didn't feel like the characters were believable : some of the decisions they made seemed way out of touch with what ""normal people"" would have done in certain situations. I also felt the plot lacked depth and substance: the last 40 minutes of the movie was just a bunch of screaming alongside shaky camera work. The director had ALOT to go with (C'mon, Chernobyl is the ULTIMATE premise for a man-made disaster movie) but he missed the mark repeatedly. The film's resolution was completely pointless and extremely sloppy overall: kind of like the writers and directors were like, ""Hmm, I have dinner reservations with my wife at 7pm, how can we wrap this movie up quickly so I can go off and do other things?"" Positively, the set was amazing; the lighting was superb; costume and makeup was decent and the Slavic accents were spot-on (I hate movies where all the Europeans speak with a British accent).

The plot is a formless mess of hysteria resulting in a lot of running around in the dark uttering gibberish.  All because a group of nitwits decide to take an unauthorized ""extreme tour"" of the abandoned town Pripyat near Chernobyl.  They soon find themselves stranded when their vehicle fails to start.  It's belatedly hinted that they have worse things to worry about than radiation poisoning.  From that point on, they run and shout, losing members of their party at an alarming rate to things in the dark.  Since it didn't bode well for them at the start, don't expect a happy ending.

At first I enjoyed it, though it started rather slow. As the tension heightened, I wasn't at all surprised that things went like they did until about halfway through. The creepy atmosphere of the abandoned town, all gone to seed was a great place for fear. The movie's creator's also baited us with some mysterious fish in the river when they first arrived that looked like what was in store. However, when it came down to the actual icky bugs, the film deteriorated into that stupid herky-jerky Blair Witch camera that everyone seems to be so crazy about. I hate that. Besides, not once right until and including the last scene, did I ever get a good look at the icky bugs (the real monsters). What a disappointment.

However, the clincher for me was what made me hate another similar ending  movie, The Ruins. Everyone dies. I don't care if that's a spoiler as I'm sure after all the other reviews, someone else has spoiled the ""surprise."" There is absolutely no point to this movie at all. A bunch of young adults go on a misadventure. They all die. End of story. So what? There is nothing redeeming whatsoever to this movie and I hate that this kind of garbage gets put out there. Of course, just like The Ruins, there is an audience for it. I'm certainly not one of them.

5185800,3,B008VPCL7G,"""Chernobyl Diaries"" is a pseudo-reality horror film, with lots of atmospheric, panicky hand-held camera work. It features some interchangeable good looking twenty-somethings who go to Kiev and on a whim visit Uri's Extreme Travel for a day trip to Chernobyl and the creepy abandoned town of Pripyat where the Chernobyl workers lived. In reality Pripyat is extremely creepy, and it follows that it makes an effective setting for a horror movie, and it does. When the tour arrives they are turned away, but Uri knows another way in.

Of course much menacing drama unfolds and the party ends up with a bonus overnight sleepover due to the van not starting right on cue. During exploration of the site there are attacks by wild dogs, radioactive bears, and even creepier things all of which hint at the predictable but well-done ending of the film. Much of the movie is highly contrived and utterly eye-rolling, and the excessive yelling and walking around in the dark gets old after a while. It's also a problem when the only vaguely likeable cast member is Uri, an ex-USSR Special Forces operative. As unlikely as it would be to stumble into the reactor control room at Chernobyl, that's the least of the logical issues the film has to deal with. Fortunately, the conclusion is the big payoff and it's handled well, though the closing credits and music are awful. There are a couple of inconsequential extras including the ""Chernobyl Conspiracy Viral Video,"" and an utterly pointless deleted scene.

I have mixed feelings about ""Chernobyl Diaries."" It is a great and genuinely creepy concept that had a decent first and third act, but act two was illogical and intermittently painful to sit through as I cared about none of the protagonists or their peril, so it's really a problem of execution by the filmmakers (and some especially hammy acting in places.)

5185814,4,B008VPCL7G,"I was very unsure when I bought it whether I would like or hate this horror film.  The plot set-up is simple enough: four (or, it ends up 6) young tourists from the US and Western European countries are traveling around on the cheap, and end up deciding to take an ""extreme tourist"" trip to the deserted town of Pripyat, not far from the Chernobyl nuclear reactors.  Their tour guide is a former Russian special forces member who, after leaving the service, has set up this one-man tour guide business.  Naturally, in the story the radiation has caused mutations of life in the area, and the whole trip ends up far from fun.  Use is made of the usual conventions of horror movies: the shocks that are only teasers before the really scary stuff begins; a progressively worsening revelation of the dangers involved; people who behave like idiots, running around defenseless in the dark yelling for each other and waving flashlights for example; and lastly the oldest scare tactic in the book--the darkness itself.  A few things made me like this modest film.  The Russian guy looked and sounded credibly like an ex-special-forces Russian.  The scenes of abandonded Pripyat, and of Chernobyl in the distance, looked very credible [in fact, some ""stock"" photos of Pripyat and Chernobyl actually were incorporated into the movie].  Lastly recent events make this somehow seem even more relevant: the Fukushima Daiichi disaster which in the long run may prove worse than Chernobyl, and the Russian takeover of Crimea suddenly reminds the rest of us geographically impaired: oh yeah, Chernobyl is actually in the Ukraine, not what is now Russia.  In fact our young tourists are first seen in Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine.  Overall it's not a bad horror movie.

5185838,2,B008VPCL7G,"This derivative horror film is well-shot and acted, but suffers from a lack of originality and a plot that is held together mostly with holes.

The basic concept isn't bad at all. Six young folks take an ""extreme tour"" from an ex-Special Forces Russian, who leads them around the abandoned complex of Chernobyl, an area of the Ukraine that was left in haste after a major nuclear disaster rendered the area unlivable. There's still a lot of radiation floating around in various lethal pockets, but the levels are low enough overall to allow the occasional tour group to come in and poke around at the lifeless desolation.

Well ... not totally lifeless.

Yup! Turns out the moral of the story is: don't take tours in radioactive wastelands. This, because there is a malevolent force nearby that begins to terrorize our group.

There's not a whole lot of the movie that works all that well, unfortunately. The second half of the film has a good sense of pace in spite of its repetition. The actors do pretty good jobs. The movie even is quite deft with its spookier elements (rabid dogs, evidence of past atrocities, claustrophobia, glimpsed monsters), considering that it obviously didn't have a very large budget.

The biggest problem, though, is the unimaginative script, unremarkable characters, and predictable plot.

The dialogue is pretty routine and gets grating after awhile. This includes characters stopping every fifteen minutes to argue over whose fault it is that they're all going to die. This also includes the obligatory mental breakdown of at least one character who demands that the others go back for someone who is clearly already dead. There are other moments like this, all of them evidence of a scriptwriter who confuses running in place with character development.

Speaking of which, the first half of the movie has fairly decent character development, but it also feels overlong given that audiences are all well aware of what's going to happen once our group hits the Chernobyl complex (especially if you've given the trailer a looksee). Making matters worse, the characters are all pretty much interchangeable. None of them are all that remarkable or unique, making it hard to tell them apart sometimes. (I got the two blondes confused for most of the movie.)

Finally, the movie's horror is basically the same thing happening over and over and over again (often at the expense of logic). It's not so bad since the director obviously knew how to ratchet up the tension and speed as the film progressed. Although it gets a bit dizzying and repetitive, it also keeps amplifying, which at least makes it feel like something is getting done. The problem is that it's pretty easy to predict where everything will end up, generally speaking. The film does include a tiny little twist at the end, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it also hardly seems necessary, given how few questions it answers.",1395878400,,2930,4.905050505050505

5185872,3,B008VPCL7G,"I found this film watchable, but it is really a thing to see once. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Four young American tourists travelling through Europe and on their way to Moscow decide to go on an one-day ""extreme tourism"" expedition to the abandoned city of Pripyat in Ukraine, inside the irradiated restricted access zone around Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The four Americans are:

- a very average and rather boring guy named Chris (Jesse McCartney)
- his brother Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), a not very bright and always-in-trouble kind of dude
- Natalie (Olivia Taylor Dudley), currently dating Chris, a tall blonde with average face but big breasts
- Amanda (Devin Kelley), Natalie's BFF, with less breasts but still the hottest girl in the film

For the Pripyat visit Americans are joined by two backpacking students:

- Zoe (Ingrid Bols Berdal), a tall Norwegian blonde with pretty face and big breasts
- Michael (Nathan Phillips), an annoying Australian hippie, who somehow managed to become Zoe's boyfriend...

Their guide and ""tour organiser"" is a middle-aged, rough, tough, buff and gruff but ultimately rather likeable former Soviet soldier Yuri (Dimitri Diachenko). Yuri used to be in Soviet Special Forces and still carries a gun, stays in shape and remains in touch with some of his old pals. He certainly cares for the safety of ""his"" tourists and tries to give them their money worth. He can also drive his old mini-bus almost everywhere and knows every ruin, tree and bush in the restricted access zone. Last but not least, he is also the ONLY character whose fate concerned me in the least...

Well, because it is ""this kind"" of film, you may think that the visit to Pripyat will not be exactly what Yuri and the tourists planned - and you would be right... You can also safely assume that some people (and some breasts) will not make it until the final credits.

Now, this is not exactly a bad film and I spend a rather pleasant 90 minutes watching it - actually, some scenes were even not bad - and some others were even NOT BAD AT ALL... There are some surprises, there are even some (short) moments when things get scary and towards the end this film even gets rather original. The scenario is certainly not a masterpiece, but the absolutely unique place of action certainly helps a lot - and it helps REALLY A LOT especially during the last 10 minutes...

Amongst the reasons to watch this film is certainly the possibility to later read and fully understand some of the very funny internet discussions concerning ""Chernobyl Diaries"". I personally recommend to check on IMDB page the thread called ""Things you learn from watching Chernobyl Diaries"" - it cheered me up no end...)))

PRECISION: Possession of a Geiger counter is not a required condition to see this film and neither is the possession of a fully functional brain - in fact, this film is more enjoyable if you have at least three strong beers in the system...

CONCLUSION: this is not a very good film, but if approached with not so high expectations it can be entertaining. However, my advice is to RENT, not to buy, as this is a thing to see once and hard to sell later.",1373328000,2,3183,4.739602169981917

I realize it is a movie so it doesn't have to be accurate, just entertaining, but nobody acts like these people did in the situations that they were in.

A modern city of 50,000, abandoned in a matter of days, everything left behind, frozen in time by the radiation danger that sealed its fate. If ever there was a place to set a horror film, Prypiat should be it.

Which is one big reason that Chernobyl Diaries, a found footage horror movie from the creators of Paranormal Activity, is such a disappointment. The movie starts off strong. Four friends join an extreme tourism excursion to Prypiat, with the promise that they will see things that few alive have borne witness to. But when they arrive, the guards turn them away, much to the chagrin of their guide (and the best character in the film), Yuri. Not to be deterred, our intrepid explorers break into the city through a back gate. But once they begin to explore the ruins of Prypiat, they begin to suspect that they are not alone.

The strength of Chernobyl Diaries is obviously Chernobyl and Prypiat themselves. The movie does a fantastic job of recreating the abandoned cities, and the period while the group is exploring the city--before anything unusual at all happens--is the best part of the film. But once things go badly, the film lurches into clich and typical horror movie territory. People do stupid things they shouldn't do. They split up. They refuse to stay in places of relative safety. They turn their backs to dark hallways.

Chernobyl Diaries is pretty standard bad horror movie fare. And that's a shame. It started off with so much potential.

P.S. In March, I took my own trip to Prypiat. If you are interested in checking out the pictures, I've posted many of them on my blog. Enjoy.

I'll admit, Chernobyl Diaires could've used some work by adding a few more scares and a more worthy ending at the end but, for the most part, Chernobyl Diaries was a good film that I enjoyed watching. I, too, am like another reviewer who stated that he/she loves to watch films for himself/herself basically and he/she hardly listens to those that claim a film is bad due to the fact that people like films for different things.  I totally agree. Chernobyl Diaries is one of those films you'll either love or hate. Taking a look at how I rated it, I loved it!

Chernobyl Diaries is one of those films that needs a followup to it, in my opinion, but probably won't get one due to the fact that the majority hated it.

5185881,3,B008VPCL7G,"Chernobyl Diaries is another horror film about Old Navy models doing dumb things with spooky results. Chernobyl Diaries follows this tired formula but has a few original quirks working in it's favor; the strongest one being it's unique and haunting location. Let's go over each aspect and I'll warn for spoilers because the best way to enjoy this is to know absolutely nothing.

-The Characters: They're your typical idiot characters, the asserting D-bag, the timid naysayer, the big breasted bimbos, and the weird couple. However when s*** starts to hit the fan the actors pull past their stereotypes and go a bit above and beyond with their acting, and I'm sure they'll get some good acting offers after their horror stint with Chernobyl Diaries.

-Atmosphere: Probably the best aspect about the movie. From the minute they step foot in the irradiated town there's an omnious chilling vibe to everything. The characters go through many abandoned rooms and there's a sense of decay to civilization (shame they didn't play off that more). The minute there's a threat established the director wisely plays it with subtlety. The camerawork is also excellent, it seems from the way it was filmed this could've very easily been a hand-held horror movie, and the director maintains the intimate closeness of that style without relying soley on it. The scene when everyone's in the van is all filmed from their point of view without any glimpses outside, you feel stuck with the characters.

*Spoilers*
-The Scares: The scares in this are completely downplayed which worked for the most part. Instead of showing close-ups of the monsters with blood and gruesome effects and all it shows them as shadows in the distance, and there are some great scenes where you see the shadows descending upon the characters in a vacant lot, showing a better side of horror than watching someone get killed with a chainsaw. I was hoping they'd take it further as the movie progressed but instead it just kept them as indiscernable shadows which got irriating after awhile. If something never establishes the threat after a suspenseful build-up it's not enough for me, so stuff like the Blair Witch Project or The Tunnel are all build-up and no payoff, just blueballs; while on the otherside movies like the Thing or the Descent have a great payoff that tops their build-up. Too much build-up just feels lazy to me.

-The Payoff: What made Chernobyl Diaries' first half so good starts to play against it because at some point I was less concerned with the characters/story and more interested in just what exactly was going on, figuring out the mystery. Needless to say it did the whole 'less is more' approach and it didn't work for me. The last person alive gets caught by scientists who take her into a lab and throw her in a room with irradiated mutants. I guess they let a bunch of irradiated mutants loose in Chernobyl, but it made no sense why. Also the animals seemed mutated as well, did that have anything to do with it? It didn't really make the whole thing eerier, it just raised more questions than it answered, and after all that build-up and waiting I felt a bit cheated.

So yeah, Chernobyl Diaries is very gripping, suspenseful, and creepy for it's first two acts, however on it's final act it seems to run out of steam and can't maintain the excellent atmosphere it kept up. Still a Nobyl *ba-dum tshh* effort on the director's part, because good atmospherical horror is rare to come by these days and I'll take what I can get.

Those extra climatic scenes that you never know whats going to pop out are a plenty. Dogs, fish and a bear that are ""deformed"" from the radiation. But I guess its the end that had me ask, ""Is this it?"". I need to scout around and find out what the alternative ending is on the Blu Ray.

It starts off with a good idea, something original. But it all just ends up flat and predictable.

That's if you're normal. If you're crazy like me and you're a huge Chernobyl fan (the real event, I mean), then you will probably have a fun time with this movie. Although not actually filmed in Pripyat, it looks extremely convincing (and this is from someone who's seen many, many, many pictures of Pripyat). That's about as accurate as it gets though. Everything else is so very wrong, except for the important key facts. Things that are wrong include like how there's no one else at Chernobyl, when really there are people working at Chernobyl around the clock. Like how the radiation will eat away your face if you enter the Reactor 4 control room. Oh, and the zombies, yeah, not accurate. But still really fun if you're obsessed with Chernobyl. Not at all scary, but that wasn't my motivation for watching it.

Instead the movie left me with a million unanswered questions, completely unsatisfied. There are so many scenes that lead to nowhere it's frustrating beyond words. The movie did not incorporate any of the historic aspects to try to make the story believable, even for a little bit.

The town is suppose to be poisoned by radiation, even 20+ years later that no living creatures should be able to survive, especially animals (fish, bear, German shepherds). Unprovoked killer German shepherds, really? I rolled my eyes so much during the movie, it pained me to continue.

5185903,5,B008VPCL7G,"Chernobyl Diaries is highly recommended for anyone that likes the video game/movie series Silent Hill.  I mean, you have the dark dreary setting, dogs walking through a bleak environment, an eventual nighttime setting with people walking through the frightening torn down/deserted unknowns with flashlights... this is all too reminiscent of the Silent Hill series.  So yeah, it feels like a minor ripoff of Silent Hill but because I'm such a big fan of the series, I really don't care.

Besides, this movie has *atmosphere* which many horror movies don't even bother including these days so I definitely respect that.  It's about a group of young adults that venture into the potentially dangerous radiation zone of the Chernobyl incident in Russia.  They're basically in the middle of nowhere when their vehicle breaks down so they're forced to make several decisions- look for car parts, wait for help to arrive or... my favorite, take the dreaded 13-14 mile walk to the nearest town.

When night falls, this is when the monsters come out to play.  I don't want to spoil too much but just know that the mystery and eerieness of the daytime setting combined with the dreaded uncertainty of night translates into effective results for me.  I think the movie writers did a terrific job hiding the actual monsters.  For a long time we're not really sure what's going on because the film is based around atmosphere more than anything else, and this *exactly* what I'm looking for in a horror film. By the end... well the truth is, I *still* don't know what was out there.  I'm calling them monsters but it's probably inaccurate.  I have my suspicions but don't want to spill any potential spoilers, so I'll keep my mouth shut.

This movie has everything going right for it.  Atmosphere and uncertainty is a winning combination.  Oh and what about that brown bear scene earlier?  That was TOTALLY unexpected and brilliantly executed!  A perfect movie for horror fans.",1364083200,,1963,4.920972644376899

After being rejected entry into the city, the group sneaks in and runs into a whole mess of trouble. This is your very basic zombie film, with nothing extraordinary about it. You've seen this story a hundred times, but what makes Chernobyl Diaries different is that it takes place in Russia and features a talent cast. What's interesting about this cast is that none of them have any background in horror. Jesse McCartney is a singer who does mostly voice over work, and Devin Kelley is almost strictly a TV actress. Taking these role was something new for them and they really put all they had into it. I feel like it was wasted effort though, as this film really is nothing different. Friends on vacation go to a unique location and run into something supernatural that tries to kill them, it's been done over and over again. The unique location made for a great start to something, unfortunately the writers didn't know what to do with that, and the result is another ordinary film that gets an average rating.",1362960000,2,1403,4.661290322580645

5185919,2,B008VPCL7G,"I've been fascinated with the events surrounding the Chernobyl disaster since I was just a teenager. I've also always been a horror movie enthusiast and buff. So you can only imagine how piqued my interest was when there was a film coming out that sought to combine those two interests; taking advantage of the local superstition and legends to, hopefully, create an interesting, frightening tale.

The first red flag was that it came from the makers of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious."" I enjoyed the latter (though the ending ruined it for me), but was never a fan of the Paranormal Activity series. The first was fun, but it all went down hill from there when the creators decided to take a path that lead to completely unrealistic scares and 'explanations' for why everything was going all crazy. (I mean, Google has all the answers, right?) Of course, my favorite horrors and thrillers always involve very realistic settings and going-ons: Settings and events that are done subtlety and believably so that you can easily see these events actually happening to YOU. As soon as that realism starts to go though, my interest wanes. I know not everyone has this taste though, so I try to keep an open mind.

I'd heard lots of nasty reviews on this movie, so never really bothered getting out to the theater to see it. But now that it's been out on DVD/Amazon Streaming, and I found myself with a sick day at home with nothing better than do but lounge on the couch and keep pumping myself full of medicines, I thought ""Why not??""

POTENTIAL SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT:

Don't get me wrong - I still sat through the entire movie and even enjoyed elements of it. Nonetheless, I felt there could have been so much more done with this movie to take it over the line between Scared-Teenagers-Lost-In-The-Woods slasher flick (akin to the Hills Have Eyes) to the haunting piece of visual artistry that would stick with you that I always hoped a film about Chernobyl would be. If I tried - for one moment - to attribute the facts about Chernobyl and Pripyat that I had learned through years of casual studies to this film, it was all I could do to not flip a table and start ranting about how unbelievably inaccurate the whole thing really was. I was eventually forced to turn that part of my brain off to be able to find any enjoyment out of it, and to convince myself they weren't really in Pripyat or Chernobyl at all. There are so many myths and urban legends the creators could have pulled from, so many political statements they could have made, so many ways they could have taken this movie deeper - could have made it more raw - that I can't believe they chose to take the lazy way out by saying that the survivors of the disaster turned into mad flesh eating mutants that 'escaped' from quarantine (which is astoundingly insensitive, given the plight of REAL LIFE Chernobyl survivors: [...]

I was expecting a tale regarding the spirits 'trapped' in the city by the radiation... Or maybe a tale focusing on mutated animals that prowled the forests around the city. Or maybe even a statement on the effects radiation can have on the human brain, inducing things like hallucinations and severe paranoia. Hell, they could have one heck of a twist at the end by explaining it all away as one big hallucination by the lead character.

Aside from all that, the movie itself was sub par at best. A real 'Wrong Turn' or 'The Hills Have Eyes' sequel - because let's face it, even the originals of those two flicks were better. A good portion of the acting in 'Chernobyl' was horrid enough to make me want to hack up a hairball. Honestly, my favorites were Uri the tour guide and the back-packing couple that came along for extra 'filler' - or maybe I should just say canon fodder. The writers of ""Chernobyl Diaries"" seemed to assume that their audience were dumb as bricks, and the entire movie was chock-full of dialogue intended simply to explain to the drooling masses what was going on at any given time. I'm surprised it wasn't full of ""that's a van,"" ""that's a dog,"" ""that's the gun"" lines, just to be sure that everyone was on the same page. Many of the actors seemed rather detached through portions of it as well. Scenes where they would be running for their lives were all but ruined if you paid any attention to their faces, as they often just looked a little confused rather than terrified.

All in all, if you're sitting down to watch this movie as a piece of art or commentary on the events and myths surrounding the Chernobyl disaster, don't bother. Take some time to google it yourself, and I guarantee you'll find more satisfaction out of reading the myths and legends yourself. If you're sitting down with a couple drinks and the same expectation you go into watching the newest teenage-slasher-flick (maybe with a few friends nearby for some laughs), then by all means. Just don't go into this expecting it to be any deeper, any more intriguing, than say the next 'Scream' or 'Scary Movie.'",1362182400,,5006,4.617977528089888

This film is so much better than the 2.5 stars here on amazon and 20% on rotten tomatoes. When I think of 2.5 star films I think of ""Smiley"" for example, which is simply terrible. This movie is so much better than that.

What makes this film great is that it solely relies on the atmosphere to evoke fear. Not all blood and gore or the god awful torture porn that is virtually all we see in horror films nowadays. There's something to be said for a movie that defies that.

The beginning of the film (before they enter Chernobyl) is solid. The acting is good (much better than in most horror movies) and the story line is set up perfectly and we're intrigued. The first half of the film nails it. They enter Chernobyl, a creepy and original setting that gets us on edge along with some great jump scares. Having said that, the film has huge potential, we can tell that even by the trailer alone.

I will agree with many people who say the second half is a letdown and could have been much much better. It is set up perfectly but really does nothing with it. The plot becomes a blur and there's no twist that the film really needs. If they had put more thought and time into it the movie could have been 10x better. This was disappointing.

Overall I accepted this film for what it was and was glad I saw it. I would recommend it but don't have your expectation high, just take it for what it is.",1361318400,,1410,4.246268656716418

If this film left that out and the tail end it would have been one of my all time favorite movies.  But the end is cheap.  There is also the usual hackneyed plot points.

Noticing the consensus among the other reviewers that CHERNOBYL DIARIES is pretty awful, I figured, ""Well, maybe I'll just take a glance and fast-forward through it if I get bored."" It immediately got my attention, and I watched it all the way through without a problem.

CHERNOBYL DIARIES is compelling, well-filmed, and well-acted, with very good cinematography and dialogue. It relies more on tension than horrifics, and, while there are one or two unsettling scenes, it makes good use of what it DOESN'T quite show. Though actually filmed in Hungary and Serbia, the ""Ukrainian"" setting is convincing enough. It's another low budget affair: NOT ""found footage,"" but employing the same general atmosphere, with the welcome additions of a steady camera and a solid plot-line.

Still, I can see why most viewers aren't just absolutely thrilled by CHERNOBYL DIARIES. It's fairly predictable all right and will probably remind you of many other recent films (some of which, in my estimation, deserve to be trashed more than this one does).",1358985600,,1050,5.1647058823529415

All action is happening in Chernobyl.  A group of tourist decides for no apparent reason to visit Chernobyl in what they call ...extreme tourism. Nothing but stupid curiosity could drive a group of bored young people who grew up with iPod and iPhones to do this kind of irrational move. Everybody knows exactly what will happen, and indeed it really happens. The reason I gave three stars is because the acting is really decent, the special effects are well done, the decor is really creepy and interesting, but most importantly, I personally like the alternate ending. Otherwise it was a horror movie without any real suspense. If Chernobyl is replaced with a house in the middle of the forest then it goes down to one star.

They decide to see as much as possible, and visit Prypiat, the abandoned town next to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, despite not being permitted by the guards and knowing the dangers that may surround the radiated area. I didn't like Chernobyl Diaries, but I didn't hate it either.

Chernobyl Diaries has a simple storyline, with plenty of jump-scares; yet, the jump-scares have been seen a dozen times and are often ineffective; for example, sticking your hand into something while everyone watches in suspense, then pretending to be grabbed by something. In fact, most of the scares were predictable and most of the death and action was done off-screen which leaves the film with barely any shock value. This problem probably could've been less significant if it didn't rely solely on jump-scares to frighten the audience. Honestly, there are only 2 or 3 genuinely scary scenes. The acting was okay, not great but not terrible either, although there were a couple scenes that seemed forced or overacted. I did enjoy the environment/setting of the film, it felt authentic and creepy at times. This really helped the film achieve a 2 star rating from myself, otherwise, it would've been a 1 star film. I can't comment on the music, because I honestly don't remember hearing any at all, which is disappointing because I love horror soundtracks.

Ultimately, Chernobyl Diaries fails as a horror film, especially for die-hard horror fans that have seen this film dozens of times before without actually watching it, but the chilling environment and the 2, or so, decent scares save the film from a terrible 1 star rating. If you must watch it, I recommend a rental.

Chernobyl Diaries has strong blood and violence (although most of the violence is off-screen), and no sex or nudity.",1354665600,,1859,4.971061093247588
5186031,1,B008VPCL7G,"Ever since Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project, Hollywood has been trying to re-capture what made those films amazing. And ever since then they've just failed over and over again. I saw this movie in the theater last night with two other people and about 30 minutes in, the ENTIRE theater had just given up on the movie. Everyone was laughing at the parts that were supposed to be scary, everyone was criticizing how stupid the plot was and how dumb the characters were being.

If you're looking for a scary movie, DO NOT watch this. The only scary parts in this movie are jump scares and those get boring really fast.

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***

So let me get this straight, a guy who is planning to propose to a girl is asked by his brother, ""Hey instead of going to propose to the woman you want to marry, wanna go to site of the greatest nuclear disaster in history that's also still radioactive with a tour guide I met on the internet?"" And the guy agrees to this?

Plus they tell NO ONE where they are going, the military tells them to turn back because it's dangerous, but they still wanna go in anyways?

On top of that I would really like for Hollywood to stop using radiation as a plot device that can just do anything the movie needs it to? Radiation can apparently mutate fish into killer monster piranha, turn people into monsters, give them night vision and make them immune to further radiation poisoning? Sure, let's just throw all we know about radiation right out the window because the plot says so.

Another thing that's stupid is that their van breaks down and they have to spend the night in Chernobyl. We know whatever is there doesn't like sunlight, so they're active at night. They hear something outside and it turns into an episode of Scooby-Doo. ""Hey, what was that noise outside? Let's split up gang!"" Seriously, they were almost attacked by a bear, they KNOW it's dangerous outside, why not just stay inside your van where you have some semblance of protection. Then as soon as the sun peaks over the horizon, you start walking. They stated it's 20 kilometers to the nearest guard station, you could walk that before it gets dark again. I mean, you would live if you did that. Then again I guess that would make too much sense.

Also I want you to think about this, if you were in a dangerous area, there are things outside that want to kill you, your significant other has had his leg mauled, and you might not live throughout the night, would you really turn on your cell phone camera to record the two of you chit-chatting? Seriously what are you going to do with that footage? Upload it to Facebook or YouTube? Then again I guess that wouldn't help to advance the plot.

Another thing, I don't care how many of these radiation poisoned guys you get together, you're not going to have enough strength to knock a 2 ton van over and move it roughly a block and a half.

What's worse is that you never really SEE the monsters. This worked for Cloverfield, you never see the monster clearly until the last 5 minutes of the movie, so there's a pay off. In this movie you just see flashes of things that look human with some discolored patches on their skin. I was staring at the screen squinting and at the end of the movie I was scratching my head and thinking, ""what the hell did I just watch?""

Okay one last thing and I'll wrap this up. Two of the characters end up near reactor number 4 where the disaster happened and the radiation is the worst and the Russian military shows up and kills one of the last survivors. They take the last survivor, the brunette girl and they talk in Russian so she can't understand them. They say they can't let her go because, ""She's seen them!"" So they put her in a room with the mutated people and they eat her. Ummm... if you were going to do that all along, why didn't you just shoot her like you did the other guy? Save time and just put a 50 cent bullet in her skull and leave her inside the contaminated area and let the mutated people eat the remains.

5186039,2,B008VPCL7G,"My first mistake was assuming the film was shot on location in Pripyat. My second mistake was buying it.

I've been interested in the story of the Chernobyl disaster for some years so I decided to buy this movie, even though I was aware it was a horror film. That was because I stupidly thought they had shot in and around Pripyat. Anyone who knows a fair bit about the real story will immediately realise the actors are not in Pripyat, though props have been built (such as the ferris wheel) to help add to the realism. The street lights were the dead giveaway for me. They are completely different to those still standing in Pripyat. At least they managed to find some derelict buildings of a similar style in Serbia or Hungary where it was actually shot.

My review is not to pass judgment on the qualities of the script from a horror genre point-of-view. After all, horror is not my fort.

There is not much originality in these types of movies, they follow standard format, you get little exposure to seeing what's killing peeps, why you ask, it helps build tension.  This movie like Cloverfield and Skyline are usually misunderstood by many reviewers.

5186098,3,B008VPCL7G,"The Chernobyl Diaries(released May/12)stars Jesse McCartney as Chris,Jonathan Sadowski as Paul,Devin Kelley as Amanda,Olivia Taylor Dudley as Natalie,Nathan Phillips as Michael,Ingrid Bols Berdal as Zoe and Dimitri Diatchenko as Yuri. Boy did the Blair Witch project really start something,eh? Since then we have had a plethora of movies all done on a budget with that fast,in your face,home video,quick cuts from here to there stuff,a loose roaming camera,all with various results. Most have been nothing of import,just poor imitations. Chernobyl Diaries takes that same feel,along with a Cloverfield style,and brings it to the foreboding lands around the Chernobyl nuclear plant,specifically Prypiat. I found it to be better than I expected,but still nothing to write home about.
The story finds a group of happy go lucky young American tourists(aren't they all before it all goes south?),traveling across Europe,to meet up with one the of groups brother in Kiev. They land at his place,who intends to take them to Moscow,but has arranged an extreme tourist guide to take them into the dead zone around the Chernobyl plant;specifically the town of Prypiat. This is the town where the workers were all housed that worked in the plant and who were evacuated literally overnight when disaster struck in 1986.
They arrive at the tour guides place of business,one Yuri,an ex Soviet special forces man,where they also are joined by a couple of Australian tourists who are back packing. This group all pile into his old van and off to Prypiat they go. At a Soviet checkpoint they are turned back,but Yuri knows another way in through a back road. They take this and before you can say ""meltdown"",they arrive in the workers town. They are parked near some apartments and they do a walkabout around and through some of them.
In all these types of films there is a catalyst as to the reason they get into trouble,which usually comes swiftly. And that moment here is when the group return to the van and it won't start. Somebody or something has wrecked a distributor cap and wires. They are stranded now and try as Yuri can,he can't get the van fixed. Night falls and they hear a noise. Yuri and one of the brothers investigate. Yuri is killed and the brother barely makes it back alive. It's a tense night and next day four of the others decide to try and hike out. Along the way they find a group of abandoned vehicles which yields them a distributor cap. When they get back to the van it has been overturned and its occupants gone.
From here the remainder of the group find themselves in darkness once more and are running for their lives through the underground areas of the buildings. A small Geiger counter that was Yuri's tells them that the radiation level is getting ever higher. At this point there are only two remaining and the one guy cannot see. They finally reach open air only to be confronted by soldiers. It seems they got completely turned around and ended up at the plant itself. The guy is told in Russian to stay,but pretty much blind and unable to understand,he ends up being shot dead. The remaining girl is taken into custody and is presumably going to be treated. But she is locked in a cell where she is soon surrounded by beings much like those encountered in Prypiat. Her screams end the film.
Of course you cannot look too closely at the ""plot"" of a film like this,because the holes are like Swiss cheese. As in,why,when they got back to the van with Yuri and they immediately discovered the wires were tampered with,did they not hike out in daylight? But that would have ended the film right there,right? One incident that didn't come off as well as I am sure the film makers would have wanted,was the bear scene. While looking in one of the apartment buildings,a big bear comes lumbering down the hallway,right past them all. It was a tad too obvious that the bear was tame and just going into camera view then out of it,to its trainer. However they all acted,of course,like they had comethisclose to being the bears snacks,but the bear's body language gave it all away.
I have played both video games of Prypiat and I saw here many scenes out of that game that had been seemingly re-created,yet there are no credits to that effect. The film makers DID seamlessly blend their  location shooting in Hungary and Serbia with stock footage shots of Prypiat.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a deleted scene and a well known You Tube vid about 3 minutes long on the Chernobyl disaster.
All in all another Blair Witch/Cloverfield styled film in which a group of young tourists end up stranded in Prypiat,Ukraine,and have the experience of their very shortened lives. 3 stars.",1352592000,2,4757,4.773058252427185

None of the characters were likeable so as things started to happen (which took forever!) I didn't even care.  There was nothing to make me jump, no scary creatures that I could SEE but there was a lot of running around in the dark with a flashlight.  While I understand the concept of it's not what you see that is scary, it would have been nice to see a bit more just to get an idea of what those idiotic 20 somethings were running from.

5186115,4,B008VPCL7G,"This movie was very effective because it didn't ""show, in full"" what the protagonists were running from.  One HUGE element to horror movies, that almost always falls flat nowadays, is that ""showing less, than more, is scary.""  The fact that there was little to no special FX makes this movie stand out among all the CGI saturated drek that has come out in the last 15 years.

To enhance your viewing keep in mind that the longer the tourists are in Chernobyl, the more they are exposed to the lingering radiation left behind from the meltdown back in the 86'.

But remember, readers, be your own judge!  Watch the movie without outside bias. Go in it with a clear mind.  Come out and THEN go to the reviews and discuss.  Don't take someone else's words for your own, especially if it's meant to discourage your curiosity in watching ""said"" movie, TV show, reading ""said"" book, or listening to ""said"" music.  It goes with everything.  You be the judge, and you alone.  Follow this ""critique"" rule of thumb and YOU WILL ENJOY YOURSELF much more than if you were to judge ""it"" from the start.

I recommend Chernobyl Diaries.  It was a breath of fresh air to see a newer horror movie incorporate effective suspense elements that we really don't see anymore; mostly because of the saturation of CGI in the media as of late.

5186129,3,B008VPCL7G,"This is a scary movie.  The kind that you would watch with a date.  It is also unusual in that it departs from the well-worn scary movie formula of over-the-top gore and excessive violence.  For the better part of the movie, you are wondering just exactly what kind of threat the characters are facing.  So there is mystery there also.

The idea behind the story is actually pretty good.  It takes place in Russia.  Here you have a group of young people looking for an adventure.  Or a ""kick"", depending on how you look at it.  So, when one of them decides to go on an extreme sightseeing tour, they agree to go along.  They hire a tour guide, Yuri.  They then board his tour van and off they go to Prypiat City.  Now, this city is located in Chernobyl.  The reactor employees and their families lived in this city.  When the meltdown of nuclear reactor 4 seemed inevitable, the families were then hastily evacuated.  There was no time to bring anything with them.  All their belongings were left behind, to rot away in what is now a ghost town.  The city and its surrounding forest has been vacant since 1986.  The area is off-limits to anyone.  Radiation levels are still too high.

The group arrives at what appears to be the center of the old town of Prypiat.  The young people (3-boys, and 3-girls), along with Yuri, goes inside the empty buildings.  Here we see normal, everyday items left behind by the former residents.  Rusty cars, bicycles, and even a ferris wheel litter the landscape.  Nature has not quite reclaimed the city, but the process has definitely started.  After an hour or so, Yuri decided that it is now getting dark and they need to get out.  Unfortunately, the tour van refuses to start.  Someone, or something, has pulled off the distributor cap.  And so the horror begins.

Now, the acting at times is substandard, but good enough for this type of movie.  Every horror movie has to have its fair share of idiots and this one is no exception.  Yeah, there is an idiot or two in every group.  I guess if the main characters were smart, there would not be a movie, right?  Interesting plot, creepy location, and bad acting combine to make this a fair movie.  Obviously, it was not filmed on location.

5186137,1,B008VPCL7G,"I was not exactly sure what to expect from this movie when I purchased it. I had heard that it was put together by the same people that did Paranormal Activity so I was expecting ghosts and things moving in the night. Basically that the abandoned city was haunted with the ghosts of those who tragically died there. I was sorely disappointed. If you have not already concluded, the movie was a cheap monster horror flick that was pathetic at best. If I'm going to watch monsters I want to see them and they better be awesome, and the story better be believable, this was not the case.

I may have been at a disadvantage because I have thoroughly studied Chernobyl and Prypiat, which by the way is NOT Chernobyl. Chernobyl is a separate town/village outside of the exclusion zone. Prypiat is a separate town built about 2 kilometers from the reactor facility to house the workers. I consider Prypiat the scariest place on earth. Death lives there, and its killing you and you cannot see it, you cannot feel it, you cannot taste it, and you cannot smell it. Chernobyl and Prypiat are locations of great human tragedy.

By having such knowledge I was picking out inconsistencies and impossibilities in the movie particularly near the end. In the years immediately following the disaster and evacuation of Prypiat, the whole region, especially the 10 mile exclusion zone were highly radioactive. Nothing lived there, even trees died in many areas such as the Red Forest. Nature has a way of cleansing itself, and in recent years the radiation levels have gone down enough to allow very controlled tour groups. You have to have a Geiger counter on you at all times, and you must stay off the grass and earth surfaces. Only hard surfaces are safe.

There is no secret road through the woods leading into Prypiat so that was the first fallacy. Then the nimrod parks the van right at the May Day ferris wheel which is one of the most contaminated spots in the city as it got huge doses of fallout on that side of town. They go trouncing through grass and leaves which are radioactive. Almost as an after thought then Yuri whips out the Geiger counter and it gives off a weak reading and he declares it safe. NOT!

Buildings can be entered and most are trashed from vandals and the elements. They are dangerous and scary. Finding the dead animal at the entrance was faithful to reality and should have served as a warning to the true dangers lurking there. The bear scene was a complete joke. Although the buildings are open there is no food in them to attract an animal, particularly on upper floors. They would have been better served having a military guard in there checking the building out.

The whole mutant story line is ridiculous. It reminds us of the 1950's SciFi when radiation fallout was all the rage and we had movies with mutated Ants and mutated Spiders etc. Radiation does not mutate humans, it kills. So even if a hand full of former residents of the city were able to hide in a basement, they could not have survived long enough for the radiation levels to subside enough so they could go outside for food and other basic staples of life, so they would have been exposed and killed if they did or starved to death.

The one thing that really got me was the tunnels. There are NO tunnels that go from Prypiat to the reactor facility, period. So all of that was a complete pipe dream of some writer. They did do a decent reproduction, or used one of the original control rooms from one of the other undamaged reactors that was not shut down until the early 2000's. But there is no possible way for them to be running in a tunnel or passage right next to the damaged reactor as its completely enclosed in concrete. Third, the movie shows them burning and going blind from radiation. This will not happen as fast as the movie shows. Even the firemen who first responded to the reactor accident thinking it was a simple fire and who were exposed to high deadly doses of radiation did not immediately suffer those types of injury's. This was such a huge turn off for me.

There are plenty of other stupid and impossible scenes. Prypiat is not a radio dead zone for a half decent radio. Yuri could not establish contact for help. Did he go to the roof top of one of the buildings to get a better chance of his signal making it out, nope. Another is when the small group leaves Chris and his girl in the van to go get help. They are walking through woods which are earth which are radioactive!!! They see dogs which still begs the question of why are they there as there is no food there for them, and if they did find a dead animal and eat it they die from radiation poisoning. (there are dogs there though in real life.) They try to circle around the dogs, I suppose they did not realize how sensitive dog hearing is maybe? Then they come across the vehicle grave yard. First, this is not in town so they must have gotten to the outskirts. Those vehicles are there because they cannot be scrapped. They are contaminated. So what do they do they go climbing all over and into them, and start touching them. Great way to die from radiation poisoning.

So the whole movie was a joke, inaccurate, and not in the least scary. In fact it was quite predictable. If these are the same people that put out Paranormal Activity, they really stepped down the ladder on this turd. They even had obvious filming bloopers. For example, Yuri parked the van parallel to the ferris wheel. Yet during the night scene it was on a street between the apartment buildings and Yuri ran down the street for over a block before the gunshots. Poor, very poor.

Avoid this movie, do not waste your time or money. There isn't anything new shown of Prypiat than what is already out on the web. In fact they didn't even use a lot of the actual buildings like the theater complex, hotel, and schools.",1350950400,8,5873,4.491573033707865

Peli who wrote and directed the found footage ""film"" ""Paranormal Activity"" on a shoe thread budget has branched out to other projects including this one. Here Peli writes and produces ""The Chernobyl Diaries"" another shot-on-video shakey cam experience that's long on atmosphere but short on scares. Directed by Brad Parker this is the type of direct-to-video junk you might see premiering on the SyFy Channel.

""The Chernobyl Diaries"" looks dark and murky for most of its screen time but that isn't a surprise given that most of the action takes place at night and in buildings that are illuminated by nothing more than a flashlight.

Second, the movie itself....my son saw this in the theaters and as we share a love of all things scary, he highly recommended that I watch it when it was released to DVD/BluRay.  We watched it together and I was left disappointed.  While the plot certainly left room for what could have been a truly scary movie, the actual film left much to be desired.

There were only a handful of suspenseful scenes that you want in a horror flick.  And as far as the ""bad guys"", you really never get a good look at them.  Sometimes, that can make for a better, more intense scare - fear of the unknown - but this movie let you see enough to feel like you should've gotten to see more.

I didn't have enough interest after watching the movie to find out if it was actually filmed at the Chernobyl disaster site.  I have to say, if it wasn't, they did do a good job with the scenery then - it looked very realistic.  Other than that, it appeared to be just another low-bugdet psuedo-zombie movie and with that being such a prolific genre, there are many choices that are much better scares than this one.",1350604800,5,1225,4.337719298245614

If you can recall pretty much any teenagers-in-the-woods type horror movie and throw in Chernobyl as a backdrop, you've basically seen this film.

The plot logic is spectacularly dumb. The whole radiation problem isn't really treated as an issue as the film drags on. Then there's a bear, some mutilated fish and packs of dogs, none of which pose any sort of challenges to our intrepid gang. As per the genre, they gradually get picked off one by one and make no effort to leave despite having no food, water or a clue.

In terms of direction and production quality, don't expect much. You don't get a single shot of monsters in the film and many scenes are so dark you can't see anything. All of the films this copies do a better job of scaring and suspending the audience but this just limps through 86 long minutes without achieving anything.

I began losing interest in the movie when a bear comes blazing down the hallway but what did the movie in for me was when the ex-spetsnaz (Russian special forces) takes running off into the woods at night with just a 9mm and no light to find out what's making a strange noise. He already knew the woods were extremely dangerous at night. Why not just stay in the van until morning when he said he would fix it? To me, the scene was solely shot so that the movie would keep dragging on. Plus, why would you start blaming and yelling at the guy who quite literally, is their only hope of getting out alive. It's just common sense not to piss off the guy who can fix the van and has the only gun.
Next plot hole, the girl who was taking all the pictures see's a guy in one of here pictures looking at them from a 6 story window but says nothing to anybody about it....why? So far, theyhave only seen dogs but now she knows there are other things here also. Why wouldn't you share that information?
Next as the film drags on, the group splits up (how cliche) and a couple people set off in search of help but happen to find a replacement part for the van but you can probably guess what happens to the van. It's destroyed when they return and the people who stayed back are gone.
Finally, the last 30 minutes of the movie are exactly as another review said, running, screaming...then more running and screaming. A little kid shows up out of no where and is obviously meant as a distraction while someone else is taken and killed all the while the group is oblivious. More running and screaming. Then, I have never been inside a nuclear power plant but it was very obvious the survivors were but they kept running straight through the destroyed reactor building and finally, the last two plot holes. One of the survivors speaks Russian but 'just happens' to speak only English when the Ukrainian (Chernobyl is in Ukraine if you didn't know) soldiers arrive. He keeps walking towards them even though he is supposed to understand their language and they kill him. All the while, where did the mutants go that were chasing them. The mutants have already killed guards in the past so why do they disappear suddenly. Finally, the sole surviving person is taken to a hospital, barely able to talk because of radiation poisoning but the so called 'doctors' throw here into a solitary confinement cell and miraculously, she walks, talks and hears perfectly just before being killed by the mutants in the cell.

All in all, it wasn't a waste of my time but paying more than a few bucks, I would consider it a waste of my money.",1349654400,35,3213,4.407407407407407

Not very surprisingly, the ending is also illogical junk.  There are far superior movies of this ilk out there such as The Descent and even C.H.U.D.

5186161,2,B008VPCL7G,"I love found footage films.  People always seem down on them.  Most of the time, unfortunately, these folks are right.  While the found footage style of immediacy lends itself well to certain stories, it just fails with others.  The problem with Chernobyl Diaries is that it really could have been a cool addition to the maligned genre.  However, after the introduction of a decent set-up and some tolerable characters, the film goes almost nowhere until the very end.  I understand the less-is-more technique of scare-tactics, but once you reveal what the threat is, shouldn't it be revealed for the audience to see?  At least in the third reel?  There was no supernatural, Blair-Witch angle which would have made it classier or spookier to keep the threat out of the eye of the audience.  We find out what the problem is.  Why not show us something we can lock on for a second?  Why just show us blurry glimpses at this point?  It's aggravating.  The movie just spins its wheels while the dim-bulb characters run around like imbeciles.  Whatever, shame on them for going on that sketchy, have-to-break-into-the-site freak-town tour (not to mention running into the dark, TOWARD the sound of snarling beasts).  I guess I'll have to watch it again to try to appreciate it on its own merits, but the film itself just bored me with its lack of innovation and originality.  It wasn't even fun.

5186164,2,B008VPCL7G,"The trailer looked promising, but the product delivered only disappointment.

The trailer doesn't show us a whole lot in terms of estimating what kind of horror this will be.  Really, we see just enough to know that the acting isn't awful (actually it looks quite good...for a horror flick) and the production value is competitive.  I'll go so far as to say that an unusually good job was done building the plot up to the ""extreme tourism"" trip to Chernobyl.  I liked the characters (enough, at least) and enjoyed a few clever, light-hearted laughs.  Jonathan Sadowski  is charmingly funny and he brings that to the screen here early in the movie.  Characters like his are typically fun to watch things hit the fan.  Makes me think of Grave Encounters (2011), where the jokester finds himself freaking out as he learns ""it's not a joke.""  This flick also features Nathan Phillips, Ingrid Bols Berdal, Olivia Dudley, and Jesse McCartney.

Though a bit prepackaged--a la Wrong Turn past the Cabin in the Woods where the Hills Have Eyes--the premise worked and the creepy setting created the opportunity for some great scenes.  Just the opportunity, though.  While the set design worked, the crux of the movie (i.e., the anthropophagous mutants), was poorly delivered.  Sadly, there are really no special effects at all in this movie.  That is not to say they are bad, but that the way the ""action"" and ""horror"" are presented no effects are really necessary.  Now, horror movies can vary.  Depending on the style they may not need any CGI or fake blood (e.g., Paranormal Activity had minimal FX).  Contrarily, movies in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre vein rely heavily on excellent make-up artists and mutant movies need solid mutant concepts that keep us from saying ""hey that's just like in that other movie with that guy in it that came out last year.""  Well, this was a mutant movie, and no one in the audience could pick one of these mutants out of a line up after seeing this movie.  That's how little you see, and the only blood/guts/whathaveyou is post-attack.  Bummer.

Producer Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity director/producer; PA 2 and PA 3 producer) has a great mind for creepy suspense.  I think he was going for a monsters-driven quite creeper; the reason we never really see more than blurry silhouettes of the flesh-eating antagonists.  This general mystery tactic worked in Insidious (2010), when the creature was some other-worldly specter.  But this movie was advertised as suggestive of The Hills Have Eyes in an abandoned fallout city.  Maybe there was a way to make this work, but Peli didn't find it.

I haven't really addressed the plot...there's not much to say that you don't get from watching the trailer.  Some likeable 20-somethings on a European vacation decide to take an extreme tourism excursion to a village in sight the Ukrainian power plant on record as having the worst ""bad day"" ever.  When they try to leave the car doesn't start.  Then they start dying one by one--and you never see it happen!  The escape strategy never gets anyway, the characters (not surprisingly) don't develop beyond a few cheap lines of dialogue, and there's an inexplicably stupid not-so-twisty ending.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD?  Grave Encounters, the Paranormal Activity series and White Noise deliver the creepy suspense desired in this flick.  For hungry mutant redneck whatevers aim for The Cabin in the Woods, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series or Wrong Turn.  For suspense and blood and guts galore: Final Destination 5.",1345334400,9,3532,4.9405772495755516

I have to start by saying that the movie was actually pretty entertaining and kept me watching. The biggest problem I had with it is that it didn't really know if it wanted to be a real movie or a ""found footage"" type movie. The movie was filmed like the ""found footage"" in the way that you only get one point of view the entire time and was like you were there. Unlike most movies like this though no one in the group has a camera so it wasn't a true found footage movie.

5186171,2,B008VPCL7G,"OK, so I was at the movies the other day and this movie was playing along with Avengers who got excellent reviews BTW (which I haven't watched yet! but have no doubt as to which movie is better quality) Anyways, the problem was I had no time to spare and so I chose this film. You can't fault me! I was never a big fan of horror movies but from my knowledge of them this looked like a promising one to watch. I mean the title was interesting, the plot premise was too. And of my knowledge of Chernobyl (the nuclear reactor who exploded some 25 years back and all the damage it made) I thought this would make for an entertaining as well as an educating movie *hence the title DIARIES OF CHERNOBYL* I was expecting some Ghosts being disturbed or some dead bodies being awaken by the presence of humans but No..None of that happened.

The film started out nicely, it was quick and straight to the point a group of tourists touring Europe for vacation and for visiting the brother of one of them who was supposed to be their guide his name is Paul. So, anyway they made it half way to come visit him in Ukraine and he thought it would be a great idea if he can take them to see Chernobyl no actually the town close to it some 20 miles away who got affected by the explosion of the nuclear reactor and is highly prohibited to enter by anyone except the Military not to mention the danger of getting exposure to the nuclear radiation that is still looming in the background. But it's OK for Paul it's all in good intention the goal is to have a good/adventurous time let's break the rules for once and be it a ride to remember. And of course it was a memorable ride even more so than they thought it would be. I was fine with the film till they wanted to get out of that small town of theirs then you have a classic example of a Horror flick. There's no originality we know that this and that is gonna eventually happen because how else are we supposed to see a story? I was hoping they would make the characters trapped in that town in a more original way! instead of the most obvious way. UGH! WHATEVER. Then the rest of it just went downhill the *monsters* or whatever you call them were interesting only when they were unknown! Once it was revealed what they were the first thing that got into my head was ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" Honestly, they weren't half as scary as I thought they were gonna look like. And don't even get me started on the ending, it was the most stupid/retarded intelligence insulting way that I've ever thought this movie could end.

I think the one thing that saved this from being a 1 star movie to me, is the fact that I've seen it in the theaters. You know the BIG screen with the blazing Speakers actually do make a difference. It made the film bearable and well even suspending at some points but If I've seen this on my LCD TV here at home or on my computer then there's no way I'll find it as interesting.

If You have nothing to watch and I mean absolutely NOTHING then I recommend you watch this, but in the end there are Better Horror films out there TRUST ME and I don't even watch them as often. This movie could've been much more if they had better writers and a better plot and certainly a better ending! I personally didn't mind the special effects or lack of them like some other reviews have said It's not what you have it's what you can do with it. I think this movie would've been great if the director had some imagination.

5186175,3,B008VPCL7G,"Some of the more sensitive American critics found the setting of Brad Parker's new film at the site of a cataclysmic nuclear accident in poor taste. I didn't: I thought it was inspired.

Despite its title The Chernobyl Diaries is actually about Pripyat, the neighbouring worker's village, which was evacuated overnight in 1986 and has been cordoned off ever since. For most of the picture Chernobyl only glowers in the distance. It has a cameo at the conclusion.

Nonetheless, the location is terrific. Parker has managed to find, deep in Serbia and Hungary, a set spookily reminiscent of the real Pripyat, possibly another long-abandoned Communist power plant. It looks fantastic: dripping, derelict; full of burnt out cars, dilapidated industrial machinery, blown out plaster, rags of browned wallpaper and everything riddled with spindly, sickly looking vegetation, slowly reclaiming a once Ozymandial site. A wonderful metaphor for human hubris, it is badly wasted on this film's unimaginative screenplay.

That is to say, it isn't the location that is tasteless: it is the rest of the film. In genre The Chernobyl Diaries sits somewhere between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B0001B3XWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, and Elizabeth Olsen's recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-House/dp/B007ZR04AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent House</a>. However it is only rated 15. This could have been a fascinating, harrowing thriller, or even just a drama. But it's a claw-free slasher.

No matter. This low-tensile horror has few of Chainsaw's ... er, chops; little of the downright terror of Blair Witch, but much of Silent House's panicked breathing, flashlight-toting and cleavage lionising. Natalie (Olivia Dudley) appears to be in the film only to provide a pendulous canyon for Morten Sborg's camera to ogle.

There is not even one diary, let alone enough of them to justify the plural of this film's title. Indeed, the potential for suspense is largely disarmed because, for the most part, we watch the protagonists through a dissociated third-party camera and not their own video footage (as was the case in The Blair Witch Project). The sense that these poor innocent kids are alone is somewhat compromised by the implied existence of a camera crew.

In any case, The Chernobyl Diaries exclusively concerns individuals whom you quickly wish to meet grisly ends. What is meant to pass as suspense plays thus more like delayed gratification.

Chris (Jesse McCartney) is a clean-cut American student, touring Europe with his girlfriend (Dudley) and her buddy Amanda (Devin Kelley, the only character in the film with whom it is easy to empathise). Establishing shots show them unlikeably skylarking around the continent. They visit Chris' brother, Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), a student resident in Kiev, who is far worse. You immediately wish someone would punch him in his smug face, and in early exchanges, some local Kiev heavies nearly do. Opportunity missed.

Paul has arranged an ""extreme tourism"" outing with local everyman Uri (Dimitri Diatchenko) to Pripyat. It is, apparently, dead: nothing can live there.

I bet you can tell where this is going.

The others are reluctant, but agree. Without explanation they are joined by Michael (Nathan Phillips), an Australian whose role seems to be to make us like Paul better, because he is so irritating you even want Paul to punch him in the face, and his European girlfriend Zoe (Ingrid Bols Berdal), whom, like Dudley, is transparently in the picture only as ghoulbait.

The womenfolk are essentially passengers in what follows.

I won't spoil it. In its way, it is deftly done: the action is nicely implied with shaky handhelds, intermittent light and creative use of darkness. It is amazing how much mood you can summon by not filming anything. Parker could have summoned more had he elected to use incidental music, but (perhaps to maintain the Blair Witch vibe) for much of the film there was none.

As a result, The Chernobyl Diaries struggles to maintain any tension. There are stretches where the kids' exploration of the underground tunnels is tedious. Some passages actually do provide an opportunity to watch wallpaper peeling. Periodically, radioactive dogs show up to chase everyone for a bit, but never get close enough to cause cause much concern.

As seems compulsory these days, none of our protagonists have a shred of common sense when it comes to knowing when to run away and when not to bolt ignorantly into dark underground bunkers which are populated by mutant freaks (fair enough first time, but on your fourth go-round you'd think you'd learn your lesson).

But this makes it all the more frustrating that it takes them so long to get what's coming to them.

5186176,5,B008VPCL7G,"Ok. You can't scare everyone with every movie you make, and for some reason, fans of the horror genre tend to be some of the most unforgiving around. That said; let me say that I actually enjoyed this film. Here are the reasons why:

for the most part, the characters acted realistically (yes; when you are on the trip of a lifetime, sometimes for the sake of excitement people will go out on a limb and try something that in hindsight, might be a little dangerous. also one of the characters was a photographer, so the chance to photograph the reactor site would be worthwhile for her.) once the car was disabled, yes, I could see the tour guide going out to see who was out there. What some of the other reviewers didn't notice was that the truck didn't stall; it was disabled from the inside. Just sitting in the van doesn't guarantee safety; someone is obviously outside waiting for you.

The atmosphere was pretty gothic, which is what I tend to look for in a horror movie. You had whoever disabled your vehicle tracking you, crazed, hungry animals chasing everyone, and a safe perimeter/boundary that you have to be careful of to avoid getting radiation poisoning. I found myself immersed in it, the way-too-beautiful people notwithstanding.

***spoiler alert*** finally, there was the behavior of the Russian scientists, who were separate from the Russian military who shot one of the survivors. It kind of had a ""night of the living dead"" feel to it. (Man, you lived through all this just to get a bullet in the head!! my apologies to anyone who hasn't already experienced that horror classic.) The scientists decided that anyone who had seen too much couldn't, or shouldn't leave. This has been done in other movies as well, like ""Eden Lake"".",1338854400,,1751,4.715686274509804
5186177,3,B008VPCL7G,"I've been enthralled by the concept behind ""Chernobyl Diaries"" since Elena Filatova created an online photo-essay in 2004 of the post-apocalyptic wilderness in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The abandoned city of Pripyat figured prominently, a spooky ghost town that was frozen in time. This led to a rise in ""Chernobyl Stalking,"" a type of adventure tourism. In 2007 the PC game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, which populates the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone with all manner of mutants and monsters.  And that brings us to ""Chernobyl Diaries,"" in which four Americans are touring Europe:  Chris (Jesse McCartney), his girlfriend Natalie (Olivia Taylor Dudley, sporting more FX on her chest than the entire film's budget), third-wheel Amanda (Devin Kelley), and Chris' ker-raaaazy brother Paul (Jonathan Sadowski).

Paul is the black sheep of the family, which is why he's in Kiev.  When Chris leaks to his brother that he plans to propose to his girlfriend in Moscow, still-single Paul has other ideas.  They're going to take an extreme tour of Pripyat. Never mind that Chernobyl is now officially open to tourists--""Chernobyl Diaries"" is for Americans who weren't even born when the tragedy happened.  It evokes paranoia about traveling to European countries, mutation-causing radiation, and an inherent fear of nuclear reactors.

A European backpacking couple (Zoe (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) and Michael (Nathan Phillips)) joins the ill-fated quartet on the tour, led by ex-special forces guide Uri (Dimitri Diatchenko). The tragedy that is Chernobyl sinks in before things go sideways.

""Chernobyl Diaries"" was written and produced by Oren Peli, master of the ""found footage"" horror style in vogue thanks to his ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise.  That explains why ""Chernobyl Diaries"" is surprisingly subtle for a mutant-attack film.  The mutants are never seen--Peli's working with a million-dollar budget after all--but he makes effective use of regular dogs, creepy children, and the incessant ticking of a Geiger counter.  This isn't typical of survival horror flicks, which will disappoint fans looking for mutant mayhem.

The biggest problem with ""Chernobyl Diaries"" is the cast. Talented McCartney has little to do and has zero chemistry with tittering arm-candy Dudley.  Kelley, who looks the part of a Final Girl, ends up playing second fiddle to Sadowski, and he mostly whines his way through the film.  Oddly, the two characters that are most compelling are the random backpacking couple, who are far more capable and interesting than all four Americans combined.

There's no actual ""diaries"" in ""Chernobyl Diaries,"" but then this movie is more about the ""Chernobyl"" part.  And that photo-essay?  It's a hoax. But nobody seems to mind.  If you can get over some logic inconsistencies in ""Chernobyl Diaries,"" you won't mind either.",1338681600,,2852,5.414027149321267
5186178,2,B008VPCL7G,"Chernobyl, one of the worst disasters in the history of the world.  A city left deserted for 25 years.  Could there be a more perfect setting for a horror movie?  The beginning of this movie is pretty good.  It does the job of making you feel the remoteness and isolation of this place and the characters in the movie.  From the first attack they experience, however, the plot deteriorates.  The setting continues to be the star of the show.  It was fascinating to see the abandoned apartments, school rooms and even an amusement park.  The story, though, is not so interesting.  The characters spend a lot of time running from mutants which the audience never gets to see more than a glimpse of.  Other than the running and occasional bloody scenes, not much happens.  By the end of the movie, the survivors have somehow managed to travel many miles and end up, of course, inside one of the reactors.  It was just silly and nonsensical.  It wasn't scary.  I was bored by the end.  And please, if you're going to make mutants a pivotal part of the action, at least give us one clear shot of one of them.  Do not waste your time or money on this movie.  If you're a horror movie junkie, wait a couple of months and it will be out on DVD or Netflix.  Rent it.  You'll thank me for the money you save.",1338336000,,1298,4.355648535564853

5186181,1,B008VPCL7G,"Ever since Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project, Hollywood has been trying to re-capture what made those films amazing.  And ever since then they've just failed over and over again.  I saw this movie in the theater last night with two other people and about 30 minutes in, the ENTIRE theater had just given up on the movie.  Everyone was laughing at the parts that were supposed to be scary, everyone was criticizing how stupid the plot was and how dumb the characters were being.

If you're looking for a scary movie, DO NOT watch this.  The only scary parts in this movie are jump scares and those get boring really fast.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

So let me get this straight, a guy who is planning to propose to a girl is asked by his brother, ""Hey instead of going to propose to the woman you want to marry, wanna go to site of the greatest nuclear disaster in history that's also still radioactive with a tour guide I met on the internet?""  And the guy agrees to this?

Plus they tell NO ONE where they are going, the military tells them to turn back because it's dangerous, but they still wanna go in anyways?

On top of that I would really like for Hollywood to stop using radiation as a plot device that can just do anything the movie needs it to?  Radiation can apparently mutate fish into killer monster piranha, turn people into monsters, give them night vision and make them immune to further radiation poisoning?  Sure, let's just throw all we know about radiation right out the window because the plot says so.

Another thing that's stupid is that their van breaks down and they have to spend the night in Chernobyl.  We know whatever is there doesn't like sunlight, so they're active at night.  They hear something outside and it turns into an episode of Scooby-Doo.  ""Hey, what was that noise outside?  Let's split up gang!""  Seriously, they were almost attacked by a bear, they KNOW it's dangerous outside, why not just stay inside your van where you have some semblance of protection.  Then as soon as the sun peaks over the horizon, you start walking.  They stated it's 20 kilometers to the nearest guard station, you could walk that before it gets dark again.  I mean, you would live if you did that.  Then again I guess that would make too much sense.

Also I want you to think about this, if you were in a dangerous area, there are things outside that want to kill you, your significant other has had his leg mauled, and you might not live throughout the night, would you really turn on your cell phone camera to record the two of you chit-chatting?  Seriously what are you going to do with that footage?  Upload it to Facebook or YouTube?  Then again I guess that wouldn't help to advance the plot.

Another thing, I don't care how many of these radiation poisoned guys you get together, you're not going to have enough strength to knock a 2 ton van over and move it roughly a block and a half.

What's worse is that you never really SEE the monsters.  This worked for Cloverfield, you never see the monster clearly until the last 5 minutes of the movie, so there's a pay off.  In this movie you just see flashes of things that look human with some discolored patches on their skin.  I was staring at the screen squinting and at the end of the movie I was scratching my head and thinking, ""what the hell did I just watch?""

Okay one last thing and I'll wrap this up.  Two of the characters end up near reactor number 4 where the disaster happened and the radiation is the worst and the Russian military shows up and kills one of the last survivors.  They take the last survivor, the brunette girl and they talk in Russian so she can't understand them.  They say they can't let her go because, ""She's seen them!""  So they put her in a room with the mutated people and they eat her.  Ummm... if you were going to do that all along, why didn't you just shoot her like you did the other guy?  Save time and just put a 50 cent bullet in her skull and leave her inside the contaminated area and let the mutated people eat the remains.

So I went hoping to get something awesome, but all I got was a remake of the Hills Have Eyes set in Russia.  Do not waste your time or your money on this thing.  Wait until it comes to a dollar theater, the Redbox, or even better yet watch it on TV a year or so from now when you're doing housework and you just want something on for background noise while you clean.

Just plain horrible :-P",1338163200,8,4535,4.421497584541063
5186182,1,B008VPCL7G,"The trailer looked promising, but the product delivered only disappointment.

The trailer doesn't show us a whole lot in terms of estimating what kind of horror this will be.  Really, we see just enough to know that the acting isn't awful (actually it looks quite good...for a horror flick) and the production value is competitive.  I'll go so far as to say that an unusually good job was done building the plot up to the ""extreme tourism"" trip to Chernobyl.  I liked the characters (enough, at least) and enjoyed a few clever, light-hearted laughs.  Jonathan Sadowski  is charmingly funny and he brings that to the screen here early in the movie.  Characters like his are typically fun to watch things hit the fan.  Makes me think of Grave Encounters (2011), where the jokester finds himself freaking out as he learns ""it's not a joke.""  This flick also features Nathan Phillips, Ingrid Bols Berdal, Olivia Dudley, and Jesse McCartney.

Though a bit prepackaged--a la Wrong Turn past the Cabin in the Woods where the Hills Have Eyes--the premise worked and the creepy setting created the opportunity for some great scenes.  Just the opportunity, though.  While the set design worked, the crux of the movie (i.e., the anthropophagous mutants), was poorly delivered.  Sadly, there are really no special effects at all in this movie.  That is not to say they are bad, but that the way the ""action"" and ""horror"" are presented no effects are really necessary.  Now, horror movies can vary.  Depending on the style they may not need any CGI or fake blood (e.g., Paranormal Activity had minimal FX).  Contrarily, movies in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre vein rely heavily on excellent make-up artists and mutant movies need solid mutant concepts that keep us from saying ""hey that's just like in that other movie with that guy in it that came out last year.""  Well, this was a mutant movie, and no one in the audience could pick one of these mutants out of a line up after seeing this movie.  That's how little you see, and the only blood/guts/whathaveyou is post-attack.  Bummer.

Producer Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity director/producer; PA 2 and PA 3 producer) has a great mind for creepy suspense.  I think he was going for a monsters-driven quite creeper; the reason we never really see more than blurry silhouettes of the flesh-eating antagonists.  This general mystery tactic worked in Insidious (2010), when the creature was some other-worldly specter.  But this movie was advertised as suggestive of The Hills Have Eyes in an abandoned fallout city.  Maybe there was a way to make this work, but Peli didn't find it.

I haven't really addressed the plot...there's not much to say that you don't get from watching the trailer.  Some likeable 20-somethings on a European vacation decide to take an extreme tourism excursion to a village in sight the Ukrainian power plant on record as having the worst ""bad day"" ever.  When they try to leave the car doesn't start.  Then they start dying one by one--and you never see it happen!  The escape strategy never gets anyway, the characters (not surprisingly) don't develop beyond a few cheap lines of dialogue, and there's an inexplicably stupid not-so-twisty ending.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD?  Grave Encounters, the Paranormal Activity series and White Noise deliver the creepy suspense desired in this flick.  For hungry mutant redneck whatevers aim for The Cabin in the Woods, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series or Wrong Turn.  For suspense and blood and guts galore and some good laughs: Final Destination 5.",1338076800,4,3553,4.935919055649241
