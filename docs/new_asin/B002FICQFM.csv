3921861,3,B002FICQFM,"After thinking about this movie...I would probably recommend it to most horror moviegoers.

I would say if Cigarette Burns, Happy Birthday to Me and Timber Falls had a love child...The Hills Run Red would be it.

As most of you already know, it's about a group of college kids trying to find an obscure, lost film (The Hills Run Red) so they can watch it and then write a thesis about it (or, something along those lines). Students and their curiosity. Well, you know what they say...

So, in their pursuit of the movie, one of the characters locates the director's daughter, and asks her to take them to where the film was shot. After she agrees, they also talk about possibly finding one of the prints of the film which might be located in her father's old home deep in the woods. Now, I ask you...from Little Red Riding Hood to The Hills Run Red...can ANYTHING ever good come from the woods?

What I give credit most to this film is that it actually tries to have a story. Once you are done watching it...let it sit with you for a day, and then recant what you've seen. So many times we can sum up these movies in a hiccup.

A bunch of kids wander off into the woods yelling ""Let's get killed.""

Annnd...done.

What is nice about this flick is that there IS some character development (mostly by the two lead actors Tad H. & Sophie M.), followed by a great backstory (some of it which you won't see coming...amazingly enough), and a third act that adds yet another layer of story.

While some might balk that the movie doesn't kick in until AFTER they arrive at the woods where ""The Hills Run Red"" was filmed...I thought the lead up was nicely done, and it kept me interested.

I also want to point out that Sophie Monk rocks this film. It is rare seeing a ""direct to DVD release"" with this level of acting. Now, not everybody is first rate, but the two leads, and also William Sadler have credible acting chops, which I have to admire for this type of film.

And, I would of loved to have been a fly on the wall when they turned to one of the side actors (Janet M.) and had this conversation with her -

""Yeah, Janet. How are you today? Good? Great. Okay...today you are going to be raped anally by someone who has cut off his face and replaced it with a creepy babydoll head.""

""Oh, that's gre--wait. What?""

""Yeah, see, he's going to take you into one of the scariest looking rooms possible, force you over a barrel and shackle your feet. You won't be able to move.""

""Uh...""

""Mm-hmm. And, then we are going to bind your hands in front of you with barbed wire. Did we mention that you'll be screaming for your life and covered in blood?""

""Uh...how about I treat everybody to a Frappachino instead?""

""Oh...that's so sweet of you, Janet. Absolutely...right after we bring out the barbed wire and you're backdoored by Babyface. Action!""

Now, since I am a die-hard horror fan, and have a collection that most people would appreciate, I do have to point out some unfortunate flaws.

Though the movie tries to be smart, sometimes is just comes off gimmicky. For instance, the main actor's buddy has a conversation in the car that is ""Scream"" worthy. About, how a bunch of kids ALWAYS take the road off the beaten path, NEVER carry a gun, and cellephones NEVER work in time of need. Ah, so true...so true.

Well, this statement is made because each thing comes into play...once. Unlike, say ""Scream"" where the whole movie is based around the stupidity of the genre.

It kind of seems tacked on.

Also, My Fellow Horror Buffs, you will call a lot of this before it happens. One of those ""you can see it a mile away"". However, there still are a couple surprises, so hang in there.

Lastly, and this MIGHT be a ""spoiler alert"", but actually it's just more of peeve of mine than anything else...BUT! Why is it that in these types of movies today...hardly anybody lives. When did this trend start? It's NOT original anymore guys.

Most of these types of movies are now beginning to blend into one another. Crimmany, before you even hit ""Play"" on your DVD or Blu-Ray player you already know NOT to get invested in anyone. Rooting for your favorite character is now pointless, because starting with the ""Saws"" and  ""Hostels"", you pretty much know that everyone will die by film's end. And, no. You can't use that Jay Hernandez lived in Hostel. He was bumped off in the first seven minutes of ""Hostel 2"". It's almost...why go along for the ride when every movie you watch nowadays wants to buck the system and have the most anti-Disney ending they can possibly get away with.

It was terrific the first couple of times...and, now...I'm done with it, Hollywood. Nowadays...if anybody makes it out alive, you'd be picking me up off the floor versus the other way around.

And, folks, I don't mean every, EVERY, movie, but for those who have watched a lot of these types of horror yarns, you know exactly what I mean.

And, finally the extras...which no one really ever comments about. There are only two. A full commentary track with the director, producer and writer (no principle actors), and a ""Making Of"" feature.

I haven't listened yet to the commentary, but it appears that everyone was truly into the making of this movie, but I did watch the ""Making Of"" feature.

It runs about 28 minutes, has some behind the scenes blended in, is fairly informative, and also has the majority of players talking about their roles and involvement in the movie. Overall, it was worth a watch.

What I'm kind of disappointed with...is that this movie was based on a short that the director showed Warner Brothers, which got them the additional funding to flesh this into a feature length film. Uh...why wasn't that short included?

Also, the main actor had incredible, and what looked like, original horror movie posters hanging in his room (one of them being the lost film, The Hills Run Red...which was creepy as hell).

Why weren't these provided in a Photo Gallery?

Another thing that seems like a no-brainer, is why they didn't gather all the footage for the mock film ""The Hills Run Red"" and produce that as one of the special features on the disc? You kind of see the mock trailer for the film, while watching the movie, and then brief flashback scenes, but it would have been a great bonus to have all that spliced together and to see it on its own.

And, for the love of God, and all that is Holy and good...why isn't the damn trailer included? I will never understand this business. Also, the ""The Hills Run Red"" one sheet that the main actor (Tad H.) has up in his room (in the movie) SHOULD have been the DVD cover.

Welp. There you go. A solid three stars outing. Looking forward to Trick 'R Treat coming Oct. 6.

Also folks, I had the immense DIS-pleasure of seeing the remake of ""It's Alive"".

Please. Please don't make the same mistake. See this instead. Oh, please.

If given the choice of being raped by Babyface in a blood-drenched room or watching Bijou and company act in ""It's Alive"", please go with the former. You won't feel NEAR as dirty in the morning.",1254268800,8,7063,4.509803921568627

A good slasher movie with good kills, gore, and some good T&A. With some nice torture thrown in the mix! And we get a new slasher by the name of ""Babyface"". One good scare where I actually jumped. Nice little twist at the end. Good all round story & plot. Dark Castle produced it and they produced some films like House On Haunted Hill & 13 Ghosts remakes. I collect horror movies and I'm glad to have added this to my collection. Not the best movie I've ever seen, but in a world of horrible remakes and terrible sequels this will sure to keep you interested! Worth buying! Hope this helps!

The violence in the film was pretty grisly and the deaths (especially the tree scene from the movie within the movie of the same title) were really brutal and inventive. The Hills Run Red serves as a homage to slasher films from the 80's without having a mixture of Wrong Turn, The Hills Have Eyes, Scream and 8mm all thrown into the film's brash but almost explicit content. What i like about the movie is that Warner Bros. was somewhat involved with the film and i was shocked that it wasn't released into theaters because of it's gruesome and sexual content. That thought kinda threw me off from time to time. In the end, The Hills Run Red is a slasher homage done right with grisly yet brutal results.",1436486400,,875,4.341463414634147

3921877,3,B002FICQFM,"Originally written 10-4-10

A movie freak named Tyler(Tad Hilgenbrink) is obsessed with a movie trailer of a film called The Hills Run Red. The film was unfinished and banned 20 years ago due to its graphic content. The director by the name of Wilson Wyler Concannon(William Sadler) vanished without a trace along with the entire cast. Tyler wants to retrieve the film and put together a documentary on it. Together with two of his friends Lalo(Alex Wyndham) and Serina(Janet Montgomery), along with the directors daughter Alexa(Sophie Monk), Tyler sets out into the woods for the film completely unaware of the horror that awaits. -summary

In this day and age it's near impossible to find any form of entertainment with a shred of originality; but I can care less about that if a director can take old ideas and add a clever twist to them. Unfortunately, director Dave Parker doesn't really deliver much here. Now in all honesty, the film does feel different from some of its brethren but for all of the wrong reasons. In addition, the film also seems to be lacking a clear focus and comes off feeling as if it was 81 minutes of completely missing its own point.

Released straight to DVD in 2009, The Hills Run Red is an average slasher film that has a heavily familiar feel. The film began with an interesting premise surrounding the mystery of the lost movie. The pacing, suspense and the plot is fairly good by delivering a little story at a time, and the addition of character development helps quite a bit. I found the characters to be somewhat likable, and the solid acting also helped them to be more tolerable. The killer whom goes by the name of Babyface is the most interesting horror villain to come around in a long time. I really like his appearance with the broken doll face being used as a mask. His origin is as twisted as his persona, and it shows by the way he handles his victims.

Although The Hills Run Red appeals to my blood-craving senses. The film appears to suffer from some type of identity crisis and sub-par direction. The presentation almost felt as if it was a satire of the horror genre, by its overexposure and parodying of certain horror cliches, gimmicks, and character mannerisms. At times, it even ventures off into the realm of a dark comedy; but it makes attempts at being a serious hardcore slasher. This posed a problem for me, because the results weren't satisfying from either angle, and it clearly didn't achieve its desired effect. The so-called revelations leading up to the climax lacked the emotional punch, because certain elements playing into the plot twist was revealed earlier on. Therefore, the surprise twist, wasn't exactly a twist at all.

The Hills Run Red was able to maintain its high tension when the plot picked up. It delivered a good amount of chase scenes, and the action never really let up. The film isn't a slouch in the gore and violence department. The kills can be downright brutal, but in a campy way with pickaxe's to the head and various torture elements. The special effects are decent, but the coolest murders are delivered in the video footage of the mystery movie.

The film was on its way towards repenting its sins by delivering a very good, yet seen that before ending. Unfortunately, that was somewhat botched with a rather questionable twist that the film could have done without. I really don't understand what the directors aim was.

The Hills Run Red is a film that has its issues. However, it's not something that I truly dislike, because it gave me some of what I was looking for. Overall, this is something that mainly the hardcore horror buffs will enjoy. Those whom have a disdain for over the top violence and nudity shouldn't even bother.

Pros: Gore, freakish looking killer and pacing

Cons: Predictable and so unfocused",1427328000,2,3818,4.7379518072289155

3921880,3,B002FICQFM,"Best homage to the slasher horror films of the 80's that I've seen in a while.

3921881,2,B002FICQFM,"""The Hills Run Red"" is a middle grade slasher/horror movie with high aspirations and low delivery. A rather muddled story deals with the slaying of various individuals in a most horrific way by a creature named ""Baby Face"". The sobriquet comes from the fact that someone (who we never see) at the beginning of the film is shown deliberately cutting chunks of skin from his face in order to replace it with a mask to make him look like a ""baby face"". (He looks more like a broken baby's doll.)  We are never told why in clear terms this was done. He is also almost unstoppable like Jason from ""Friday the 13th"" and Michael Meyers from ""Halloween"".  Imitation here is NOT the sincerest form of flattery. This Jason/MM wannabe falls flat. Intertwined with all this nonsense is the main story which deals with the making of a now lost 80s horror movie about ""Baby Face"" that some young ""college types"" want to investigate. Led by Tad Hilgenbrinck (a promising young actor whose career is not exactly helped here), the search is on. However, is it just a movie or does it deal with real murder?  That is the question. As usual, in films of this type, nothing is what it seems. Soon our ""youthful hobbits"" find themselves in the midst of a real life remake of the original ""splatter movie"".  But what is the purpose here?  Is it to create the scariest horror film ever made?  And, if so, who will ever get to see it (except for those of us who buy this DVD)? A couple of the ""splatter"" scenes from the ""original"" are repeated multiple times (this is, after all, a low budget
film) and wear thin after awhile. There are a couple of unexpected twists at the end. But, after all is said and done, what we have here is a ""slasher blood fest"" movie masquerading as a purely ""slasher blood fest"" movie created to satisfy the cravings of a self-indulgent director both in and out of the film. It's also for the voyeur inside and outside the film and lacks even a satisfying ending.
For those who do get to see this film, they will come to realize that the only audience truly fit to see this movie is the one IN the movie!",1421539200,2,2109,4.422680412371134

I picked this up cheap recently I have to say I enjoyed the movie, it was great homage to all of the slasher from  70's, 80s. It's bloody, it's graphic, and has some nice naked scenes as well thanks to Sophie Monk. You can tell that this movie had a tight budget because there are some areas of the movie that really needed some polish and also some plot holes after you finished the movie. I feel that ""babyface"" is a great entry into the slasher genre and would love to see more come of it.

The ending was well done, and it's not a typical ending where the virgin chick always gets away at the end, this movie is more clever than that.

This movie is a lot like the title of my review says, kinda of a mix between the Blair witch and Michael Myers..maybe a bit of WRONG TURN  too........

Its about a group cineastes looking to do some kind of tribute documentary on legendary director Wilson Wyler Concannon, who's movie ""The Hills Run Red"" caused a lot of problems following its release leading to strange and unexpected deaths and people going crazy (to say the least).... The movie was quickly removed from theatres due to all the problems and propaganda it was causing in the community.

 Then the film gets lost and director Concannon disappears as well. So we have our main director Tyler, who's trying to revive that old classic that people were so afraid of by interviewing residents of this small community, people that have seen the film and witness all his influence on others .

He also manage to find Alexa (Sophie Monk), Concannon's daughter who's working as a stripper in a bar, he decides to bring her on the trip with his friends hoping to find the lost film, which, according to Alexa, might be in her father's old house in the woods where they actually shot ""The Hills Run Red"".

It's a brilliant concept we have here, very original story line who will take you on a dark and scary ride. The film will also take a few unexpected turns that should leave you shocked and on the edge of your seat!!! Baby Face is one of the most original villain we had since FREDDY,JASON AND MICHAEL!!!!!  The photography work is perfect, Sophie Monk is a pure pleasure for your eyes and there enough blood in that movie to please any horror fan!!!!...Give it a try..You won't be disappointed!!!

3921917,4,B002FICQFM,"Many films have attempted to revive the Slasher genre that died with the 80s. Most have failed (some worse than others), but few manage to succeed despite the enormous demand from the Horror community. THE HILLS RUN RED is one such exception. Dave Parker speaks the language of Splatter. From the opening moments where the tattered trailer for THE HILLS RUN RED oozes off of the computer screen, it is clear that this is no cheap imitator.

An obsessed Horror movie fan attempts to track down the last remaining copy of THE HILLS RUN RED, a Slasher film that was so depraved and terrifying that it disappeared along with everyone that was involved in the making of it after its release. As he and a group of friends arrive at the original shooting location deep within the mountains, they learn that some things are better left dead when they meet face to face with the Babyface killer that was supposed to have died along with the crew.

HRR is entirely self-aware, playing off of each of the basic genre conventions in the same vein as other Post-Modern Horror films like SCREAM or BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON. It is edited for maximum impact, with perfectly placed scares and sound effects that earn its reactions without stooping to mere jump tactics. With a cast of only four main characters, it seems improbable that there will be any sort of body count, but a few creative flashbacks and side characters are all that is needed to drench the hills in blood. HRR might be more polished and professional that its 80s brethren, but it retains the same mean spirit and heart that most recent entries lack. It also sticks close to the source material while creating its own distinct personality. Babyface is likewise a unique and terrifying new villain that reflects the hulking masked killers of the genre without copying them. Parker's attentive framing combined with the specific body gestures and mannerisms that Danko Jordanov brings to the role work to create a new Slasher icon.

Above all else, THE HILLS RUN RED is a scary Horror film. A damn scary Horror film. The unprecedented praise that the film received prior to its direct-to-video release led to many false expectations, but any viewers that were let down in their initial viewings must take the time to give the film a second chance. This is the new Slasher classic that fans have clamored for for years, packing all of the originality and suspense that HATCHET lacked while providing an equal amount of gore. That all of this was achieved on an Independent budget only further proves Parker's skills as a director.

3921918,1,B002FICQFM,"At some point while surfing the endless Internet, I ran across a blog ""The 10 Greatest Horror Films You've Never Heard Of,"" or some such nonsense. ""The Hills Run Red,"" the 2009 straight-to-DVD horror epic, was sadly on that list. I pulled this film off the shelf and viewed it because of the well-written blog, evidently penned by someone with extremely bad taste. To say I was shocked at the overall derivative and inept execution would be an understatement.

This is a terrible film, lacking skill, atmosphere and tact. I admit it has an interesting premise, but this initial inspiration is almost immediately forgotten, sluggishly regressing into a foul and ultimately boring slasher flick. Nothing during the final hour of ""The Hills Run Red"" is original, and I am furious I wasted a part of my life sitting through it. Occasionally, I will accidentally run across a film and find myself viewing images which cannot be erased from the mind. It offends me to have been violated by such crass and shallow motivations. I've been watching films long enough to know a good work when I see it, and ""The Hills Run Red"" is absolutely not one of those films. I can't, for the life of me, understand why people watch this crap, macabre&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Guignol-The-French-Theatre-of-Horror-University-of-Exeter-Press-Exeter-Performance-Studies/dp/085989696X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand-Guignol: The French Theatre of Horror (University of Exeter Press - Exeter Performance Studies)</a>&nbsp;or not.

A 20-something horror nerd is obsessed with finding a lost slasher flick from the 1980s. Titled, of course, ""The Hills Run Red,"" it was immediately pulled from the theaters because of disturbing content and even the director, Wilson Concannon, has disappeared from the face of the earth a la JD Salinger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Search-of-JD-Salinger-A-Biography/dp/0517050854/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Search of JD Salinger: A Biography</a>). Our baby-faced protagonist Tyler (Tad Hilgenbrinck) is on a quest to find this Holy Grail of bloody celluloid, repeatedly watching the rather bland trailer on line (though you have to love the wave of blood roaring down a hillside). Within 25 seconds, he tracks down the director's daughter Alexa (Sophie Monk). She's now a lap dancer at the local strip club with a nasty heroin habit. Tyler books a motel room to nurse her through a speedy, two-day withdrawal while his girlfriend Serina (Janet Montgomery) decides to have a peculiar one-night stand with his best friend Lalo (Alex Wyndham) back at the home pad. This shadowy midnight dalliance is oafishly inter-cut with scenes of Alexa's sweaty agony kicking the habit. Ed Wood would have been hard-pressed to achieve such surreal idiocy.

Okay, now that we've had sex, drugs and rock and roll, this seedy gang of four heads for a house in the hills 100 miles from the nearest town (is there truly a locale this desolate in America?). Alexa claims the movie was not only filmed at this location, but the director is buried there. ""Maybe there's a film vault!"" winks Tyler as they drive down increasingly desolate back roads. Sheesh, these clowns are deserving of their fate.

The kids, naturally filming a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>-like documentary on their search for the lost slasher masterpiece, must battle local hillbillies, the mask-wearing villain of the missing film (apparently alive after two decades) and, eventually, Concannon himself (William Sadler, a fine character actor in a film far beneath his skills), who now resides at the remote shack anxiously waiting to direct impromptu snuff scenes with unlucky youths stumbling upon his tract of forested Middle Earth. In a nutshell, the kids are tortured, raped and murdered. The two-timing dalliance mentioned earlier is supposed to excuse director Dave Parker's abhorrent treatment of these kids.

There is, in fact, a true story supporting this film's urban legend premise, an early 1970's slasher film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-House-on-Dead-End-Street/dp/B0000687C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last House on Dead End Street</a>) made by a New York hack under a pseudonym believed to have been lost for many years. Some movie buffs tracked down not only the film, evidently a vile exercise about people murdered in a warehouse, but the actual director, who had graduated to the wonderful world of porn by the early 80s.

3921924,4,B002FICQFM,"Telling the story of a young filmmaker whose obsession with an out-of-print old horror film (also named The Hills Run Red) leads him on an ill-fated mission to track down the director, the film takes us on a mini-tour of horror conventions through the ages. The trailer for the film within the film is pure `70s exploitation with its grim and grainy feel while the banter between the male leads about the nature of slasher films is a direct homage to the `90s and the aforementioned Scream series. Plenty of other horror characteristics are referenced throughout the films lean running time but without ever descending into clich.

The hulking killer who graces the film's promotional art is named Babyface and while he is clearly just another in a long line of visually arresting horror movie villains, that is exactly what he is meant to be. He is the killer of the movie's lost horror masterwork and his cracked porcelain mask and necklace of baby rattles and building blocks are exactly what you would expect from a character in such a film. This does not stop them from looking awesome however and Parker gets the best of both worlds by using the character as the real-world killer too.

The film does have a few problems and it isn't always quite as smart as it would like you to think it is. Though it has a few very cool effects shots and killings it does leave you wanting a little more from the enigmatic Babyface in order to make him a serious threat. It also has a few plot-holes and logic inconsistencies which threaten to pull you out of the action but thankfully this threat is never fully realised and the whole thing moves along so swiftly that any pit-falls are quickly forgotten, especially once William Sadler's insane movie director makes his appearance in the final act.

It should be said that all the cast acquit themselves wonderfully and turn in solid performances but it is truly Sadler's show once he arrives. Chewing scenery like crazy and dominating every frame he appears in his presence boosts the film to a new bonkers level. The third act isn't all about his character however and there are a few lovely twists and turns from John Carchietta's script which it would be criminal to spoil by revealing here.

A loving tribute to both contemporary and classic horror as well as everything in between, The Hills Run Red delivers a fresh take on a very well worn but very much loved formula. Inventive, intelligent and willing to go the whole bloody distance, it succeeds in giving laughs, scares and, rarest of all, a few genuine chills.

3921926,3,B002FICQFM,"What may appear by its cover to be a direct-to-DVD rip-off of The Hills Have Eyes is anything but, as The Hills Run Red is instead a gore-drenched shocker that is better than it should be by all accounts and purposes.  The story of the film involves a film buff named Tyler (Tad Hilgenbrinck from Lost Boys: The Tribe) who is on a search for a lost horror film from the 80s called The Hills Run Red, that all prints of which mysteriously vanished.  His search for the film leads him to a gorgeous stripper (Sophie Monk) who turns out to be the daughter of the film's director, and along for the ride are Tyler's girlfriend (Janet Montgomery) and best pal (Alex Wyndham).  As all four venture into the woods where the film was originally shot, they are soon stalked by the missing film's masked killer Babyface (Raicho Vasilev) who turns out to be anything but fake.  Loaded with some spectacularly gross moments and some nice twists, The Hills Run Red is definitely better than it has any right to be otherwise, with its killer flaw being the fact that the film as a whole ends up succomming to the genre flaws that it riffs.

I had real high expectations after seeing that trailer and reading up on the movie from multiple sources including Fangoria (I usually don't read that but it had an article on this movie so I was psyched to read it). I bought the movie, watched it, and seriously felt the deepest most unfullfilling...feeling ever. I don't see what all the hype was about this movie. It's true that it's KIND of original in the sense that the kids in this are actually smart and bring weapons with them and think of smart/desparate places to hide, but that being said everything else is pretty plain. SOME scenes are gross, but nothing a TRUE horror/gore fan will think new and unusual. I have to say, for people who don't watch these movies it will probably make you a little sick because of how twisted the movie is (especially during the credits), but seriously.....don't get this if you like horror.

3921929,5,B002FICQFM,"Back in 2000 director Dave Parker proved he could make an excellent horror film with his first feature, THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING.  With THE HILL'S RUN RED, he proves once again that he is one of the best new directors on the horror scene and lets hope it won't be another nine years before his next film is released.  The title of the film is really it's only problem since it sounds like an Asylum mockbuster of THE HILL'S HAVE EYES or something. This one is far better than most of what currently passes for horror.  Parker knows how to deliver the goods and he has come up with a very dark, grim, unrelenting and frightening horror film.  It isn't that often that a slasher pic deals with incest and pedophilia, but Parker makes it work.

The cast in this film is first rate. Tad Hilgenbrinck finally gets a role that lets him be a little more than a comic wiseguy and he keeps his clothes on for the entire movie (I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not).  He is an exceptional actor and I hope he gets more roles like this one. There is a ton of female nudity from Sophie Monk and Janet Montgomery and both actresses are quite believable in the horrible situations they find themselves in. Alex Wyndham is very good as Lalo.  We also get to see the classy William Sadler as the film's chief villain and he brings a lot of life to his character.

The film has so many gruesome bloody effects that it is impossible to list them all, and they are accompanied by a Bernard Herman type score.  The writing is very good and this script goes out of its way to avoid horror movie cliches (all the characters have their cell phones with them while lost in the woods and the phones WORK! and they also carry a gun with them).  It's a smart, effective movie that builds to a crescendo of violence and mayhem that becomes quite nerve racking.  It's an exhausting movie to watch.

I think it isn't that easy to make an entertaining slasher film (just look at what happened to the awful remake of FRIDAY THE 13th for example) but this one is head and shoulders above most of the competition.

Every horror movie steals a little from here and a little from there, but that can be said about numerous other genres as well. Nonetheless, with the countless amount of remakes and sequels being made nowadays it is refreshing to see someone take a stab (no pun intended) at their own character at least. All that aside, I was extremely reluctant to see this movie based on the cover alone. It looks like a photoshop job was done to throw a pic of the killer on the cover and replace ""Have Eyes"" with ""Run Red."" But I needed a horror fix and decided that I might as well give it a shot. Much to my surprise, this is a decent little horror flick. It follows the typical horror outline: Teens venture into the woods looking for something, killer finds teens, the chase begins... But it's all done pretty well. There is a few twists in the movie to keep you on your toes,(although one is pretty obvious from the beginning,) and I really liked the ending as well. The acting isn't all that great, but it isn't subpar either. There is a good amount of gore as well as a good amount of T&A.

For starters, there isn't much of a plot so the storyline (the mystery surrounding the lost film) is what carries this movie. To say that I got a Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe would be an understatement and it relies on some other cliches as well.

But if you can get past all that, you'll see that it's an entertaining feature with an interesting twist that gets more disturbing towards the end. And isn't that what slasher movies are all about? Unnerving the audience?

Basically, three kids go out in search of a notorious horror film that has disappeared. With the help of the director's daughter they discover that he died in his house in the woods, so they head out to find the house and, hopefully, the movie itself. Unfortunately for them, the killer in the movie turns out to be real and they find themselves in multiple life-threatening situations.

The kills are very well done, the effects are top notch, the killer is scary and unique, the story will leave you guessing and is a new refreshing twist to the slasher department.  If your looking for a new different type of slasher movie that even brings the old school greatness to the table this is the film.  Great job.",1255305600,4,550,4.525252525252525
3921936,4,B002FICQFM,"The Hills Run Red is another Film I have been anticipatng for a long time.
I found the story to be quite fresh and Babyface was the coolest and most original ""soon to be horror Icon"" I have seen since the killer in Midnight Movie. Although I saw a bit of the ""Jonah"" look from Dark Ride in Babyface he is still highly original

I wish the flashbacks were more vivid and longer because the best kills were the ones that were in the flashbacks .
The gore factor about a 7 on a 1 to 10 scale..I'm not sure if I loved the ending but it definitely left it open for a sequel that I would watch in a minute. You can tell there was thought behind it and not like most of these lets just have some rednecks lock people up and torture them type movie""although those can be fun"" and there are rednecks in this movie as well. There is of course a twist that isn't really that surprising but it still spices it up. All in all It's a solid slasher offering. I recommend it.",1254960000,3,959,4.074074074074074
3921937,3,B002FICQFM,"The Hills Run Red is a solid example of what's wrong with horror films today. We have nasty special effects, solid production values, and some decent nudity, but it's ultimately wasted on a mundane slasher/ torture plot that goes nowhere. We've seen this all before (particularly the ""film within a film"" plot). You can pretty much check off a list of concepts/ conventions that you find on the shelves at blockbuster: snuff movies? check. Torture? check. Hillbillys? double check. Attractive young people in peril? check again. And so on.

On the plus side, if you're looking for a mindless gore flick to widdle away the time, it delivers the goods. It's nicely paced and graphic, and the always entertaining William Sadler gets to chew up the scenery in a few scenes. It's an acceptable outing, but you come away feeling disappointed that so little thought goes into these types of movies nowadays.",1254700800,2,900,4.921052631578948
3921938,3,B002FICQFM,"I like slashers a great deal. As a horror fan I have seen tons of them. However I dislike wink wink nudge nudge type horror set ups in the style of scream. So I was a little unsure how I would feel about The Hills run red. It isn't a perfect film but I must say the level of effort that went into the acting, direction and writing put the film over the top, and won me over even if I don't like the self aware angle that the film uses.

The picture delivers as a straight ahead slasher first and foremost, and isn't bogged down with the smug tone that plagues most films with that movie in a movie style. None of the patting themselves on the back. The characters are actually likable and fairly well developed for a movie of this sort, and the killer is really cool and creepy looking and has one of the best designs for his getup of any killer in years. I think baby face looks awesome. And the special effects don't let one down either. There is a bit of the CGI stuff, but the gag kind of called for it on such a low budget film so I give them that.

It is well worth a look for long time slasher fans, and anyone who feels the level of both direct to video pictures and just horror in general isn't where it should be. It's not a classic, but as a good throw in movie for Halloween The Hills Run Red will do nicely. The fake trailer is also very cool. So much so that I do wish they had just made that film instead, but this works too.",1254441600,17,1440,3.9965277777777777
3921939,3,B002FICQFM,"I was pumped for this movie. I'm a huge fan of the slasher subgenre and about 99% of the drek it produces (I know it's horrible stuff, but I can usually have some fun with it), so hearing so many good things about this one got me very excited. I thought it was going to be new and fresh and was going to be THE direct to dvd movie (well, until Trick 'r Treat).
But it wasn't. It's very cookie cutter and felt watered down. It's so much so, that when things start to really happen, it almost makes it sad. The script had some solid ideas (i.e. the killer just shooting a dude in the shoulder to put him down for a bit, liked that!) but they got lost in the ""I'm obsessed with this movie I've never seen, and I'm going to hunt it down"" plot, the ""my best friend is banging my girlfriend"" sub plot/love triangle (which was the most poorly written aspect of the film, in my opinion) and the very tired ""we know how people should act in horror movies, so we won't do that"" bunch of cliche's that were thrown in during all the dialogue that felt kind of... well, just bad. The acting took me a bit by surprise, with much of the cast taking these things and really trying to make them work. The obvious highlight of the movie was William Sadler, who is always a pleasure to watch at work. He really delivers with his performance and adds a star, just for his ability to draw me back into something like this, to my rating.
Visually the movie looked amazing. You can really tell where the money went and where it needed to be. The shots of the forest and the hills, really all the exterior establishing shots of the movie were just beautiful.
And yeah, I'm a guy, so of course I'm going to say that there are really no future teachers in this movie. The girls take their tops off. Quite a bit. And it is for gratuity's sake, no matter what anyone tells you.

Overall, I thought the movie could have been better, but then it could have been much worse. I'll snag it when it hits that $5 mark somewhere if I'm bored or something.",1254441600,3,2019,4.203608247422681
3921940,4,B002FICQFM,"The film will pretty much reel any horror fan in with the opening sequence as the atmosphere is established early on and doesn't shy away from blood or gore. Lack of nudity and sexual content isn't an issue either as there is plenty of that to go around. The acting is also a bar above what you're probably expecting for a release like this. Babyface actually turned out to be quite sadistic and better than his origin let on. When you're shown how he got his name and who he really is, it's kind of lame at first. The concept eventually grows on you though and is pretty original as far as serial killers from slasher films go.

If you ever saw Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, one of its peaks was that it not only pointed out cliche moments in other horror films and dissected them but also wound up breaking most of them while going in a different direction. The Hills Run Red touches on this a bit, as well. Horror movies need to be as fresh as possible as it seems like just about everything has been done, which is probably one of the reasons remakes are so popular right now. It's just refreshing to see a movie not follow the same generic formula.

You can't always rely on your first impression as The Hills Run Red seemed like nothing more than a copycat horror film that was rushed straight to DVD. It turns out to be a sexy, blood-splattering wet dream for horror fans with a better than expected storyline, above par acting, and what could be a new face in the horror franchise. If you like films like this, give this one a go. You may be pleasantly surprised.",1254268800,2,1585,4.333333333333333
3921941,4,B002FICQFM,"As October nears the need for horror is an absolute must to bring in the Halloween season. Not sure if we were in the mood for an actual good horror or a laughable b horror is what brought us to this evenings feature The Hills Run Red. Judging by the cover you have a pretty creepy looking axe wielding maniac on the loose which is usually enough to get the green light, even though most covers are always way better then the film itself. Luckily it turned out to be pretty enjoyable with some b tendencies.

The film starts with an obsessed horror fan in search of a film called ""The hills Run Red"" which was banned over 20 years ago due to it's graphic nature. The director and cast were said to have disappeared off the face of the earth leaving only the director's daughter left. So our fanatic finds her working at a local strip club, plenty of rack action in this one, and talks her into helping him document her father's film. Eventually they get into the woods where the film took place and find the killer Babyface, who looks exactly like the killer from Dark Ride, taking the documentary a little off course. The rest is pretty predictable but what horror isn't?

Overall The Hills Run Red was a success for Sid. The acting was descent as was the story, however there was still a nice underlying sense of b which is always a huge plus for us. Certainly it's not the best thing you'll ever see and isn't all that original but it still worked. It's a little more then you're average run of the mill horror which we wouldn't recommend buying but would say it's worth a rental/free view online, or just no pants. As far as what a young Sid would have thought leads to: oh yeah oh yeah. It surely would have been enjoyed for the sheer fact it was horror coupled with plenty of nudity.",1254268800,17,1789,4.3532934131736525
3921942,3,B002FICQFM,"This movie almost lived up to its underground hype..The story, direction and acting are all well done. My only gripe, and its a big one is that 10 minutes of this movie were cut out by Warner resulting in a relatively tame production. And its very obvious where the cuts were. If the director knew that WARNER was gonna butcher his movie by cutting it to ribbons and not offering an uncut version then perhaps he should have just stuck with DARK CASTLE ENTERTAINMENT and used a lesser budget. At least the integrity of the film would have remained intact and uncensored. The Hills Run Red had all the elements of an excellent horror movie, including a horrific killer and interesting plot twists but it was clearly heavily edited and overly santitized. The movie doesn't realize its full bloody potential because of the edits. Perhaps Warner should get out of the horror movie buisness because they clearly do not understand the genre or the market and can't compete with the rest of the U.S. unrated horror market or the excellent horror coming out of Europe. The Hills Run Red should have been an innovative horror movie that pushed boundries like all great horror movies do. Instead its a good horror movie for the PG13 crowd that comes with a nifty content advisory sticker gimmick.",1254268800,3,1286,4.745535714285714
