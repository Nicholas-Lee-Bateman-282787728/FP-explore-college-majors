8433993,4,B0001N9XEA,"Despite what the cover of this DVD says, this movie stars Emmett Kelly, not his son, Emmett Kelly Jr.
The movie itself is cute, with decent, although not exceptional, acting. It is definitely from a simpler time, but it's a timeless tale of children & happiness overcoming evil & adults.",1469059200,,287,4.76

8433995,5,B0001N9XEA,"This stars Emmett Kelly SENIOR! Not Junior! Senior was THE Emmett Kelly who was responsible for the tramp character his son stole from his own father & did nothing but make money on with his figurines. Emmett senior was the one who was with ringing brothers for most of his career. To my knowledge, junior was never with any circus, much less a biggie like ringling. This movie is a cute one for kids & Emmett Kelly Senior fans. He does his famous ""sweeping up the spotlight"" bit in it, & it's just great to see the man in action. He also starred as himself in ""The greatest show on earth"" along with Charlton Heston & Jimmy Stewart, Asx well as another movie called ""The fat man"", where he played a clown who commited a murder {but he refused to play the part in his famous makeup as he didn't want kids scared of his ""willie"" character afterwards}. Not a great production movie here, but a cute one IMHO.",1385510400,2,906,4.366863905325443
