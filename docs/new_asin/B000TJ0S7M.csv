8209526,5,B000TJ0S7M,This is a funny story based on a phenomenon that occurred on one of the lakes in the Brainerd Lakes Area. One of the characters in the film was a classmate who is now deceased and I was able to purchase this for his widow. She had seen the original when presented to the group in Brainerd but never had the opportunity to own a copy. It holds memories for her too.,1415664000,,364,4.069444444444445
8209527,4,B000TJ0S7M,"If you are a fan of the series ""Girls' you might really enjoy this movie since it is very much the same type of comedy.  The writer, director, producer and star is Alex Karpovsky, of 'Girls' fame.  The movie is in documentary style about an imaginative hole in a lake that Alex goes with his film team, in search of.  The characters from the small town where this phenomenon occurs are very funny as themselves and Alex is not afraid to make himself look like a fool.
This is also his first film that he made - it was talked about in Lena Dunham's 'Tiny Furniture' - and is very funny in a dry sort of way.
I would definitely recommend this to fans of Alex's and also to Girls fans.",1383782400,,682,4.190839694656488
8209528,5,B000TJ0S7M,"This documentary style indie takes you along on reporters plunge into madness.  In short, a hole opens up in a frozen lake for no apparent reason.  By the time our hero gets there, though, it has closed up again.  His dissapointment quickly becomes obsession and finally full out madness.  Well executed, well performed.  Very high believablity factor.",1359331200,,352,5.105263157894737
8209529,4,B000TJ0S7M,"Certainly a person raised entirely in a media culture might try to imagine himself as another person within that culture, and convince a small crew and financers to get him started. In ""the HOLE story,"" the person and time turn wrong when the crew finally gets to the location to investigate something that has disappeared. My first time through, I found the pathetic aspect of the opening overwhelming. I'm sensitive to things falling apart, like train wrecks that happen before anyone knows a bridge is going to crush three frieght cars when it drops into the Mississippi River in Minneapolis on August 1, 2007, but seeing a supposedly sane person going through natural reactions to the kind of disappointment this movie starts with was gut-wrenching for me. I hate to reveal how much better it gets at the end, because coming from me, it is likely to sound like so what was I waiting for? There are three main approaches to the story: the movie, a TV pilot story, and a discussion featuring a film critic for a Boston paper who was so excited about getting to see the film for the fifth time in the living room of the main character, writer, and gracious host for a conversation about his efforts to figure out what was going on when it really seemed like nobody cared.",1214438400,,1272,4.632743362831858
8209530,5,B000TJ0S7M,"For the most part, when reviewing independent films, especially documentarians, you find that everyone is so serious. It's therefore refreshing when you find an Indy filmmaker who is whimsical and even comedic. That's the case with ""The Hole Story"" written and directed by Alex Karpovsky. Not only is this film a great comedy, it touches on profound subjects while never losing its footing.

That latter fact explains the number of festival awards and stellar reviews it has received from the Boston Globe, Minneapolis/St Paul City Pages, Filmmaker Magazine and others.

Matt Zoller Seitz of the New York Press had this to say about the film:

""I fell in love with it and have not been able to get it out of my head... It was one of my favorite unreleased films of last year and one of the saddest and funniest debuts I've ever seen.""

Michael Tully of IndieWIRE refers to ""The Hole Story"" as ""Equal parts Woody Allen and Werner Herzog... ""

Though the film is a work of fiction, it is based on an actual phenomenon that occurred at North Long Lake in Minnesota. A crevice suddenly appeared for two years running, unexplained warm water in the Lake in the middle of frigid winters, that was so unusual as get international coverage and make the cover of the Wall Street Journal. From this unprecedented event, Karpovsky spins a whimsical tapestry of a tale about an obsessed, aspiring cable television producer who wants to make a pilot to sell about provincial mysteries in American small towns.

When he arrives in Minnesota, the hole is gone, and therein begins the story of this film and the downward spiral of the main character - which Karpovsky names after himself. Before the journey of this film is completed, the protagonist loses his girlfriend and his film crew, and then things go from horrible to horrific before a light appears at the end of a very long tunnel.

The calm inventiveness of this film is a joy to observe. It's well worth your time and attention.

8209531,3,B000TJ0S7M,"The cover of this dvd is plastered with quotations suggesting a really exciting new filmmaker is on the horizon, comparable to Ross McElwee and Werner Herzog.  Such comparisons are not totally off, partly for the reason that the film obviously and very deliberately cultivates them.  The filmmaker, Karpovsky, wants to make a pilot for a series about weird regional happenings -- and it seems as though he really did want to make this pilot (and only later turned his film into something of a fake-umentary -- I don't think ""mockumentary"" fits because the primary aim doesn't seem to be mockery, though that ends up as a secondary aim when the more serious ambitions start to fail) -- and picks a lake in a small town in Michigan where a massive ""black hole"" has mysteriously appeared in a lake that by all rights should be thoroughly frozen.  He gets there with a small dedicated crew and it turns out the hole is no longer, it is now frozen.  Of course, this should be disappointing, this should be the end but Karpovsky, as we are meant to discover, is no ordinary filmmaker but an obsessive filmmaker who will turn the most pitiful failure into a triumph.  The initial hope that the hole would reappear is frustrated, and he initially considers ""cheating it"" -- getting people to talk about the hole in present tense, using trick photography to make it appear to be there.  Eventually he starts to feel as though the very non-presence of the hole is itself a mystery -- a hole would be an ordinary mystery but a hole that closes itself up just before a film crew arrives to capture it seems like the product of a trickster god, a god who is perhaps even challenging Karpovsky to persevere in spite of it all, etc.

I like the idea of making a failed project into an exciting personal documentary, but the problem is that as Karpovsky's obsessions deepen it becomes more and more obviously a mockumentary, and his soapbox preaching to himself on camera late at night in the bathroom doesn't feel like the genuine self-exploration of, say, Ross McElwee in Sherman's March (a film Karpovsky had obviously seen and emulated) or like the wild and compelling metaphysical ramblings of Herzog in many of his films, but more like an only partially successful attempt to sound kind of like those guys.  The concern is not so much that Karpovsky's film comes too late -- that it might have worked had it come first -- it is that, while Karpovsky himself stays in character (perhaps until a few scenes towards the end when he really overacts and feels really false), the story as a whole just doesn't feel genuine, and yet I really think it wants to feel genuine, and it is only occasionally funny, and yet it really wants to be funny.

All of the above, I should say, are intended merely as an honest reaction to a film that had some potential, and to a filmmaker who could easily go on to make better films.  It is a good first film, a kind of ambitious and worthy but ultimately, in my eyes, failed experiment.  I would even recommend the film, especially to young filmmakers who are considering a first, ambitious project.  I hope, also, that it is the first of many experiments by this interesting and obviously intelligent filmmaker.",1192665600,4,3232,4.640980735551664
8209532,1,B000TJ0S7M,"Ever watch the Daily Show with Jon Stuart?  You know the interviews people like Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, and others do--going into a small town, interviewing waitresses and mayors and crackpot pamphlet authors alike with mock seriousness? And you know how sometimes the attempted jokes fall completely flat and you wonder why they even left them in the final edit? In the end, however, you've at least half-smiled at the faux journalism antics of your favorite cable comedians.
Imagine now that all of the unfunny, ill-advised lines, scenes, and everything in these skits that should have been left on the cutting-room floor for lack of any humor or interest or ironic value have all been spliced together into one feature film.  That's this movie.  You won't even smile.  Every homemade video made by fourth-graders probably has shown more creativity, nuance, and respect for the viewer than this movie. Don't even bother watching it for irony's sake (""Let's watch a really lame movie tonight and make fun of it!""). There's just nothing there.",1192060800,3,1050,5.087209302325581
