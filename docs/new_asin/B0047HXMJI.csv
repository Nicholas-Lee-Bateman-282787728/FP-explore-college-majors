4285248,4,B0047HXMJI,"As always, Samantha has captured the viewers with her charms and bringing you to some places that truly unique in itself. Her liveliness and friendly personality has always makes the local people joyous and have happy sharing moments. I love watching it.",1311379200,,254,5.071428571428571
4285249,5,B0047HXMJI,"this dvd is awesome.  the price you pay for it is a thousand fold worth the price rather than buying airline ticket, booking hotels, booking local tours, etc.  the host, samantha brown, is the best travel host so far for me. unlike rick steves who concentrates on clean and aristocratic europe, samantha eats ethnic and weird kind of foods without blinking an eye. she goes to places where no host will dare go to and i can even challenge rick steves if he can do the same. she goes deep into the culture of the different asian countries and participates in them.  she assimilates herself into the rituals and does a lot of daredevil stunts into the most dangerous places. you are practically there with her when she travels and she makes it a point that you enjoy your travel with her. buy this dvd and you will have a clear understanding of asia and its people. your eyes will be opened to the fact that the economic boom is now in asia. absolutely five star rating.",1308355200,2,968,4.4576271186440675
4285250,5,B0047HXMJI,"Sam Brown is goofy and easy to watch. I've been to these places in Asia and her trips are accurate. However, they are glossed over a bit and don't give you as specific details like her shows to European cities. She doesn't state the prices of any hotels or how she gets from one place to another. Her European shws can be used to get yourself great tips for that destination but her Asian episodes are more of a very broad view of just what's to see in the country overall. She makes Cambodia look easy but I would say it's one of the hardest places I've ever had to travel to. Overall it's light hearted viewing entertainment. If you are an arm chair traveler and just want a taste of an Asian country these are the shows for you. I'm a teacher and I used 2 episodes as lesson plans for my class because it showed the country in a nut shell.",1305763200,9,842,4.171779141104294
4285251,5,B0047HXMJI,"this DVD, I am the owner of.  it is a good DVD.  I am glad this video is availible on DVD.  there is some interesting footage on places in Asia, that I love to see.",1299456000,,164,3.6285714285714286
4285252,5,B0047HXMJI,"This is a wonderful value with Hours and hours of tours. If you ever wondered what all those far East countries were like, this is a wonderful personal tour to watch. She uses local guides and interviews many local folks for an informative extra touch. Like the cover jacket shows,Samantha injects enough humar along with good music to keep things entertaining. This 2 DVD set will take many days to get through all the countries. You may want to start with Thailand. Enjoy!",1299024000,,474,4.72289156626506
4285263,4,B0047HXMJI,"Tokyo is my favorite city in the world, but there are hardly any good travel DVDs pertaining to Tokyo. I bought this DVD specifically because I wanted to see Tokyo, but the Japan episode sucked. Fortunately, the other episodes were pretty good.

The Japan episode began in Kyoto (never mind the fact that Kyoto has 1/8 the population of Tokyo). If they wanted to start in a Japanese city other than Tokyo, at least choose Osaka. I liked the cherry blossoms. Alcoholic Samantha spent a large portion of the episode at a Sake bar. I learned that Kyoto was the birthplace of the Geisha. I enjoyed Samantha interviewing a Geisha. However, it was unnecessary for Samantha to dress up as a Geisha. That ate up a lot of time. She then went to a forest to find bamboo that would be turned into chopsticks (yawn). It's only fair that I point out that the Kyoto countryside was beautiful.

Samantha took the Bullet Train to Tokyo. I enjoyed that part. However, she didn't show us much of Tokyo. There are a million things to do in Tokyo and she chose to go to a fish market to watch a fish get decapitated by a samurai sword. Then, she spent 5 minutes in an apartment playing with a kitten (I'm not making this up). She hardly showed us Tokyo. She didn't even visit the Ginza shopping district. The Japan episode was a disappointment.

Hong Kong is another cool Asian city. She took the Star Ferry across Victoria Harbor. I was impressed with the views of the Hong Kong skyline. However, in typical Samantha Brown fashion, she chose to do the most mundane things in a foreign city. She first went shopping for clothes. She then made bamboo noodles (seriously, who does this on a vacation)? I liked her visit to the Temple Street Nightmarket. A fortune teller (correctly) said that she would eventually become pregnant.

She went to the Peninsula Hotel for an afternoon tea. That was as fun as watching paint dry. I loved her trip on the cable car to Lantau Island. It was so scenic. She visited a decrepit fishing village and the famous Buddha statue. She also went mountain climbing. She participated in a dragon boat race. It wasn't my cup of tea, but at least it wasn't another trip to a restaurant. The Hong Kong portion of the episode concluded with Samantha watching the Hong Kong skyline's Symphony of Lights. That was epic!!!

In Macau, she visited a spa (could've skipped that). Macau has some nice casinos. She climbed on the top of Macau Tower. That was scenic but scary. She then went to Margaret's restaurant and made Egg Tarts. Once again, she spent too much time at restaurants. I did enjoy a shot of this bridge in Macau (don't know the name of the bridge). I wish she mentioned how to get around Hong Kong (Hong Kong has a subway, but you wouldn't know that from watching this episode).

Singapore was also included in this DVD. Prior to watching this DVD, I knew nothing about Singapore other than an American kid getting caned there for spraying graffiti on cars. The episode began with a nice shot of the Singapore skyline. The city has draconian rules- you get fined for chewing gum and not flushing toilets. Samantha went to two rival Laksa restaurants (Laksa is this dish that resembles soup). She spent too much time on the Laksa segment. Fortunately, the rest of the episode was much better.

This episode showed the diversity of Singapore. At the Raffles Hotel she met an attractive Indian woman who agreed to show her around the city. Before they left the hotel, they enjoyed an alcoholic drink known as the Singapore Sling (Samantha should start attending AA meetings). They visited a mosque in a Muslim enclave known as Kampong Glam. I learned that Thomas Raffles, a British explorer who founded Singapore, urban planned the entire city. He designated neighborhoods for each ethnic group (Chinese, Indians, Malays, etc). They also visited Little India. Samantha even participated in a Hindu ceremony (I enjoyed this since it was a city-specific activity and not something trivial like a visit to a restaurant).

Samantha took a boat to a remote island and for $2, rented a bike. She spoke to the village elder (via a translator). She also made Singapore's national dish, fish head curry. That scene was a little too gory. She visited Chinatown and went to an acupuncturist (could've skipped that- there are acupuncturists on every other block in Manhattan). Samantha spoke to members of the Peranakan (a hybrid Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian culture) and participated in their ceremony.

I enjoyed her ride on a monorail to Sentosa Island. The island consists of an amusement park, mall, and man-made beach. Samantha even rode a go-kart. The episode concluded with a ride on the Singapore Flyer (an imitation of the London Eye). The Singapore episode was the best episode in the DVD. It more than made up for the mediocre Japan episode.",1358294400,6,4855,4.7225501770956315
4285264,5,B0047HXMJI,This is a very nice video - it addreses a lot of interesting place to see and was very helpful in planning our trip. Provider delivered as advertised.,1357516800,,150,4.392857142857143
4285265,5,B0047HXMJI,"I often use Samantha Brown videos with my language classes when we have a few minutes to ""travel"" to some exotic place or another. They, and I , love her videos and wish there were more of them. She is funny and endearing as she experiences travel in a truly touristy way. My students are always amazed at the things she is willing to eat or do in the name of travel. Nice series as always.",1356220800,,390,4.144736842105263
4285266,5,B0047HXMJI,"being from the UK we don't get any of samanthas and other american travel channel shows from USA  because we are english but we do get the british version of the travel channel. I only came across this DVD from looking on the US amazon website an boy what a fantastic show (dvd set) this is, and i am now a fan of samanthas. worth evey cent. the shows are well presented, pefect picture,well shot, fasinating,interesting and each episode is a delight an will make you feel like you are with samantha visitng the best cities that asia has to offer. would highly recommend this to anyone planning a visit to Hong Kong, Tokyo etc. One of my favourite dvds i have ever bought.",1346889600,,672,4.419354838709677
4285267,3,B0047HXMJI,"Yes, I visited most of Asia and everything shown in DVD is correct if you don't mind be brainwashed. For example one part was about Bali.
Bali has distinct feel of third world country and beggars are everywhere for a start. Economy heavily rely on tourism. The bright spot is art, you will find best imaginative art in the world and, sure, I bought some. The DVD aimed at politically correct traveler and guy like me, single, not counted. All asian countries have very developed prostitution trade which never mentioned. Luckily internet is waiting for real research and fun.",1340928000,,575,4.818181818181818
4285268,3,B0047HXMJI,"This series is beautifully shot and produced, and SB is charming and appealing in some ways, but the shows tend to be rather superficial and overly focused on Sam.  Sometimes the destination seems to be secondary, merely a backdrop for Sam's preening and her cutesy outfits and antics.  And while she is appealing, she is also overbearing and talks too much.  And the frequent guffaws and shrieks and general overreactions are troubling.  While she is on TV and has to be outgoing, I think Paul Theroux's advice that ""you gain nothing by standing out"" when traveling in other cultures is still relevant.

I also noticed in the Malaysia episode a few silly gaffes or instances of ignorance  -- she referred to ""Peninsula Malaysia"" but it's ""Peninsular Malaysia""; she referred to ""Peninsula Borneo"" which is not only a grammar gaffe but a geographical one -- Borneo is an island not a peninsula; and she did not, or pretended not to, know what Kuala Lumpur meant in the native language.

She also appeared decidedly uncomfortable in some of the open air markets, even remarking how she wanted to avert her eyes from the strange foodstuffs.  Why bother visiting?

In all, a nice overview of some Asian destinations and a visual treat, but it's often spoiled by her cringe inducing behavior and lack of polish.  I suppose the show's intro tells you everything you need to know.",1334707200,,1373,4.829059829059829
4285269,5,B0047HXMJI,"For over 10 years the Travel Channel's Samantha Brown has traveled around the world and have given us  her fresh,unique,wonderful,totally Sam insights on places that for some have dreamt of going and being there and now she travels to Asia.

I will admit right here now on the second paragraph,that I have a huge crush on her ,she is delightful,smart,funny(really really really funny),charming,beautiful,sexy and has this very open curiosity about the places that she travels to,not okay here's what to see and what to do but rather going on the journey and embracing in the what happens in the journey itself.

In the her new dvd she goes to Asia and I believe that this her best one yet,from Japan where she sees and experinces the culture of the geisha and drinking sake,to the country of Cambodia and the experinces of visting the Killing Fields,to Bali and the beautiful natural splendor it contains,she helps us,the viewer with that look of what makes that country so appealing and the way she connects with the  people. What makes this dvd so refreshing is that she will go off the route of what is to see and embrace and look into what the people do,where they go for fun,what is their favorite places to eat,what is a good place to stay and in this particular dvd how Sam looks and takes in the very spiritual side of Asia. She goes each country;Bali, Japan,Singapore,Hong Kong,Vietnam,Thailand,Maylaysia with a openess that makes so appeling and that insatiable curious of what the countries holds and offers.

I can only hope that the Travel Channel will get off their indulge let's show people eating too much food ass and get her back on have her more traveling.
This dvd is a must for those who want to travel but also want to connect on a incredible deep spiritual and emotional level with the country and their people.",1323043200,2,1834,4.736677115987461
4285270,2,B0047HXMJI,"Samatha Brown is interesting enough and she can be fun, but she spends very little time really exploring the culture of a country. This series could be a lot better if she concentrated less on fluff, but much more on the historical sites, history, and museums. Brown also stays at very expensive hotels, which is an unrealistic expectation for far too many travelers.",1321315200,8,367,4.841269841269841
4285271,5,B0047HXMJI,"Bought this DVD because I lived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for 3 months back in 1970. This was BEFORE McDonald's was there. Only thing there in 1970 was 2 A&W Root Beer shops and I visited both. Also, only one ""mall"" in a 4-story building.
Things there have sure changed! Almost everything was great about this DVD (loved the Robots in Japan, too bad they are so expensive!) EXCEPT the Fish Eye. That was gross! Would love to see some of the OUTTAKES from that episode and see if Sam reams those guys a new one for doing what they did!",1316649600,3,534,4.297029702970297
4285272,4,B0047HXMJI,"This is a good set of shows to watch if you want to relax and enjoy the scenes. Being a Cambodia nut I went straight to that particular episode and I did find it a bit light in some ways, with some aspects of recent history glossed over in a fairly confusing way, but she did go to the Killing Fields outside Phnom Penh and acknowledge the genocide- except it seemed, from her explanations, to have happened in a vacuum, there wasn't much clarification on how or why it occurred ( certainly no mention of the US bombing campaigns that pushed the Khmer Rouge towards their victory but I wasn't expecting this to be mentioned - bit of a downer for the regular viewer so let's move on). There are some inaccuracies- the National Museum is mistaken for the Royal Palace, and when she goes to the national park by Koh Kong, the guide's subtitles ( why he needed them is a mystery as he speaks clear English)erroneously have him talking about the mango forest when they are obviously going through a mangrove area.
However, it is a good snapshot of the place, and her visit to Vietnam is also good viewing. She's a bubbly and engaging host and the the locations are beautifully shot.",1313020800,,1177,4.47906976744186
8418172,4,B0047HXMJI,"one of the best dvds to collect!! except does not show enough of Malaysia and Indonesia,
