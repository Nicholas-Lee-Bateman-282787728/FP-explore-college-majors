333850,5,6301328507,"This movie is very dear to me...a treasured remembrance of a mother and daughter staying up into the wee hours of the morning to watch it when it would occasionally air on television.  The love story of Gavin and Babbie is so endearing.  Katherine Hepburn, in an unusual turn, plays Babbie, a young gypsy girl who dances through the forest of Thrums and touches the lives of the poor weavers who live there.  For her, it is folly to escape from the confinements of Lord Rintoul, a wealthy lord who rescued her as a child and now intends to marry her.  Into her life, comes Gavin, the new minister of the Auld Licht Kirk, played by John Beal.  Raised by a beloved mother who sacrificed all for him to pursue his calling, Gavin is very serious and has had little life experience when he arrives in Thrums. The little minister struggles mightily to resist Babbie's charms once their paths cross, but in the end her pureness of spirit,  kindness, and innocent beauty enraptures him.  For Babbie's part, what starts out as amusement, flustering the young minister and making fun of his prim and proper ways, turns into something she never expected. She  experiences unselfish love for the first time, and it is the minister who risks all to show her this.  Knowing that she can only bring him ruin, she tries to run away, but a kind old soul intercedes and sets them on a course to their future together.  That road is not easy but the character of both Gavin and Babbie as they face the townsfolk and Lord Rintoul, shows how much they have grown in the light of love.  Having read the book  by James M. Barrie many times, Ms. Hepburn and Mr. Beal beautifully capture the essence of Babbie and Gavin.  They are surrounded by wonderful supporting actors who bring to life memorable characters, such as: Rob Dow, Margaret, Dr. McQueen, and Nanny Webster. Add in a lilting Max Steiner score and the dressings of a small Scottish town, and you have a rare gem of a movie!",1320278400,13,1962,4.5397727272727275
333851,4,6301328507,"After the twin debacles in 1934 of the film ""Spitfire,"" where she played a hellcat from the mountains of South Carolina, and the play ""The Lake,"" which inspired the famous Dorothy Parker barb, ""She ran the gamut of emotions from A to B,"" Katharine Hepburn returned to Hollywood (stopping off in Mexico to divorce her husband Ogden Ludlow) and signed with RKO to do six more films during the next two years. The first film in Hepburn's new contract with ""The Little Minister,"" a Scottish romance written by James M. Barrie, which gave her the opportunity to do her Bryn Mawr accent with a pronounced burr.
Hepburn played Lady Babbie, the young ward of Lord Rintoul (Frank Conroy), who lives in the Scottish town of Thrums in 1840 and likes to masquerade as a gypsy girl.  In this costume she makes the acquaintance of Gavin Dishart (John Beal), the humorless young minister who has arrived in town, and slowly but surely gets him involved in the town's labor problems involving the weavers of Auld Licht Kirk.  Of course the ""little minister"" falls for the gypsy girl and she takes pains to mold him into the perfect man to be her master (she actually uses those words).  Meanwhile, the townsfolk are aghast that their minister has been hanging out with the gypsy wench, and are prepared to fire him form his post.
Hepburn's performance is more than adequate and reviews at the time compared it favorably with that given by Maude Adams, the premier Barrie interpreter, several decades earlier.  Beal is no more match for Hepburn than his character is for Babbie, and it is rather hard to believe she is the man of his dreams.  However, this film from director Richard Wallace has the advantage of an very strong collection of character actors, including Beryl Mercer as Margaret, Alan Hale as Rob Dow, Donald Crisp as Dr. McQueen (""Do not show me his ha-er"").  The adaptation of the Barrie story (which was both a novel and a play) was by Sarah Y. Mason and Ictory Heerman, who had won an Oscar for Heburn's ""Little Women,"" and Jane Murfin, who had a hand in the disastrous ""Spitfire.""  The result is more of an emotional drama that the original tender comedy.
The verdict at the time was that these costumes dramas were what resulted in Hepburn being labeled ""box office poison,"" but ""The Little Minister"" is a decent little film.  Hepburn has some fun playing the gypsy side of Babbie and also gets to do one of her better crying scenes from early in her career at the film's pivotal moment.  Along with ""Little Women,"" this is the one other early Hepburn film that could be characterized as being charming.",1070755200,2,2608,4.676855895196507
333852,4,6301328507,"This film is a poignant vision of Scottish society in the 19th century. It is centered on a new young minister arriving in a village in Scotland. He has to face two things : the greed and inhumanity of the lords who exploit the workers and the residents in the village, to the point of getting the army to help them. He preaches peace but he is not listened to because a gypsy girl is agitating the population. His second ordeal is love. He falls in love with the gypsy girl who manipulates him to the point of making him ring the alarm when the soldiers are coming and of protecting her in various situations. This leads him to missing a prayer session, being dismissed, getting involved in a scuffle at the church and getting wounded in the process. But the girl is not a gypsy at all, or nearly not at all. She is the abandoned girl the local lord has saved and nearly adopted, at least raised as his daughter and he wants to marry her. But he is not in love and she is with the little minister. Love of course prevails and she changes her loyalties. This raises two questions in Scottish society. The power of the Elders in a church. They can dismiss the minister as they please and they do not take into account any circumstances that could explain some events. They are extremely authoritarian and strict and their only aim is to keep the peace in the village, even if it means abiding by the decisions of the powerful against the powerless. In other words, they defend an established institution and not Christian morality. The second question is that a local lord can marry a girl under his position, but a man cannot marry a girl over his position. The minister could not marry the girl if she were a real lady. He can only do that becasue she is an abandoned child raised by the local lord. Social stratification is extremely strict in this society too. Finally this film reveals a brilliant and young Kathryn Hepburn and that is definitely a good thing.

333853,4,6301328507,"This curiously little-know Hepburn film is a fine, respectable version of the play by Sir James M. Barrie. In 184O, in the village of Thrums, Scotland - whose main industry is weaving - the local villagers anticipate the arrival of their new minister, Gavin Dishart (Joan Beal) with great enthusiasm. Soon after his arrival in Thrums, the little minister meets Babbie (Hepburn). Her proper name is Barbara: she is actually the well-educated fiancee of Lord Milford Rintoul, but she makes Dishart believe she is indeed a brazen, bewitched gypsy.....Contrary to what a previous reviewer noted, Hepburn was a full 26 years old when this was filmed - NOT a teen-ager! Barrie's original novel dates from 1891. Maude Adams played Babbie on the stage with great success. Margaret Sullavan badly wanted to play Hepburn's coveted role of Babbie. The film was not a financial success for RKO: it lost $1O,OOO at the box office.",1041811200,6,917,5.0
333854,4,6301328507,"This is an underrated,but charming film version of J.M.Barrie's classic novel. The part of Gavin is very well done,and,though Katherine Hepburn showed her lack of experience at this point in her career,her performance as ""Babbie"" is spirited. The youth and innocence of the main characters is clearly shown,and they eventually,if somewhat clumsily,triumph in their love for each other. I recommend this movie,but don't expect it to follow the original story as well as it could have.",996451200,3,483,5.368421052631579

7812529,5,6301328507,This is one of those early 30's films that made Hepburn the well known actress she was. It takes place in Scotland during Victoria and tells the story of A young minister and his unexpected love for a woman he believes to be a gypsy. Of course the plot begins to change in unexpected ways but then that was the interesting element in many of Hepburn' s early film. A rarely seen and enjoyable film.,1388707200,,398,4.32
7812530,4,6301328507,"Kate is Kate in this.  This is one of her earliest films.  She is in her 20's in this and just delightful.  She is a wood nymph and a very silly, fun, and sexy one at that.  She completely bamboozles John Beal in this one.  He does no know if he is coming or going.  This is a fun film for everyone.  Watch it if you can.  It is in my personal top 10 films of all time.

7812531,5,6301328507,"This movie was made at a time when the storyline and the acting were crucial to the movie; there just were no ""special effects"" that can compare to the movies made today.  That being said, I like the old black and white movies (from the 30s especially), but I was totally surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  My husband was equally surprised and just as captivated by the movie as I was.  The storyline is quite simple but the characters are not and the acting was excellent.  I wouldn't have changed a single character.  We were drawn into the story early on and thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie.  If CGI and adrenalin rush are prerequisites for enjoying a movie, don't buy this one.  If you enjoy simplicity, old style acting, and interesting characters, you will enjoy this movie.  Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy CGI (some have reached remarkable levels of expertise now) and action, but there is also a place for simple plots and wonderful character actors.  I wish there were more movies made today that were character and plot driven.",1376524800,,1051,4.6378378378378375
7812532,5,6301328507,"I enjoyed this movie.  It stayed pretty true to the book.  It features a very young Kathryn Hepburn.  My favorite line in the movie - ""She's still a gypsy.  There's nothing you can do to change that!""",1369872000,,200,4.324324324324325
