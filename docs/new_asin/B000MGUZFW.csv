2735397,4,B000MGUZFW,"This is a film that I have had on my buy list for several years.  The movie is typical of many Philippino gay films, though this one is a bit different given the director's style.  Essentially, a young man is drawn into the local gay bath house.  There we get some idea of the workings of a Philippino bath house.  Emotions flair, love is made, love is lost, and in the end true love is found.  Overall a good movie that I am glad is now part of my collection.",1378339200,5,460,4.066666666666666

2735400,4,B000MGUZFW,"very good film.  i just wish once, the whole film would be put out to the
public.  i read a review of their toronto film festival screening and
the movie that was released on DVD seems to be missing half of what
the reviewer said.
otherwise this is a great film, with all actors doing very good job",1220918400,8,298,4.120689655172414
2735401,4,B000MGUZFW,"It was really interesting seeing how a bathhouse actually works and i know what goes in there.  But to get from the outside and see the inner workings all the different people that come in there.  Not all of them are gay, some straight, bi and you have your transexuals as well.  Also of importance was them talking about being safe and everything.  Especially being with what they do and all the people they sleep with.  Its easy to pass that along.  But there is also a bond and kinship that forms between the different people in the bathhouse.

The lead actors play it well one being a newbie and the other a seasoned (very) veteran of the bathhouse.  The new guy falls for the seasoned vet and at first all is going good even though things aren't what they seem.  The new guy soon starts to change his attitude towards people since he's been hurt by that one he loved.  It turns around him later on in the film but i wanna go into all that much detail on it.  It's really a movie that you should check out either rent or whatever you have to do.

But give Bathhouse a try i believe you'll walk away better for it...this movie is shot in the same way as the director's previous one.  Just so people know what's what...doesnt detract from the movie at all so enjoy Bathhouse i sure did.",1190160000,9,1288,4.2946058091286305

2735443,5,B000MGUZFW,"I'm slightly embarrassed that I chose this film because of the cover and title, which seem to promise lots of hot sexy men having hot sexy man-sex!
But, it's not porn, there are all sorts of messages, images, themes that give this film an earnest, quality throughout. The protagonist, Rico, and his portrayal by Ray An Dulay, really caught me: the crazy idealistic beliefs, dreams, intentions manifested in his face, got me to take that leap of faith, complete suspension of disbelief in this character. I was enraptured looking at him, as is he was a real man in the world, thinking, is there any way he can live with these beliefs, and how will he get disillusioned, when it comes time. I hope he will be alright! (I thought). When circumstances change, his cynicism and cruelty also seem real.....
I also root for the filmmakers, who clearly are far from having the resources and skill-pool that we do in the US for film, but because it was clear from the outset, I certainly didn't judge the movie based on that.
Overall, for me a great experience.",1472256000,2,1052,4.6310160427807485

2735549,2,B000MGUZFW,"The cover of this video promises something exciting... but that never happens. This is not a movie. It is a meandering mess. The only thing I can remember is the young lead (who, granted, does have haunting eyes), saying ""Cris, Cris!"" endlessly. For reasons that are all fabricated, he falls in love with the king of the bathhouse. His entire life seems to be about gaining acceptance by Cris. He cannot see himself in any other way. It's sad in every possible meaning of the word.

I gave this two stars because the truth is, as awful as this film is, the type of world portrayed in it (secretive, furtive, desperate, clandestine get-togethers amongst gay men), is a world that existed very clearly when I was young, and still exists now, although, in certain countries, gay men no longer need to participate in the dark worlds shown in this film.

This is an amateur film where the director and writer cannot decide who or what to focus on and have important points, jokes, shots, and storylines that they feel compelled to show, whether or not they contribute to the overall whole of the film. As a result, it's a disaster with no glue to hold it together.

There is not a single erotic moment in the film. Anyone expecting hot orgies or frontal nudity or anything that might slightly arouse them would be better off looking at their own reflection in the mirror while nude (whether or not they like themselves).

Efforts are made by some of the actors to act, especially the young lead, who might actually have a smidgen of talent. But other than him, it is amateurish at best in every department.

Again, I gave it two stars, because gay men of a certain age will well understand the self-hating gays that populate this film and will be able to relate to certain lines, situations, scenes, etc. That said, it doesn't make the film worth watching and it ended up being a sad little laugh-fest that I watched in bits and pieces over 3-4 days when I had nothing to do.

If the writer/director can pull his thoughts into a cohesive form, he might have something compelling to say. Until then, he just has a bizarre pastiche of cliche-ish moments of a world that was sad, dark, dismal and didn't benefit anyone in the long term.",1439683200,3,2228,4.571428571428571
