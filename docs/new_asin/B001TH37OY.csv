3789992,4,B001TH37OY,"I enjoyed the first 4 disks of the 5 dvd box set beginning at the point in time of the rise of the Japanese Navy and early military expansion into China and the worlds reaction.  From there into the Pearl Harbor attack,  the declaration of war by Roosevelt and the slow recovery of the US Navy.  These grim days are highlighted well but finally the tide turns beginning at Midway and slowly but surely the US wears down the Japanese with superior technology turning out better planes and pilots, a new generation of warships and well conceived military strategy organized by gutsy Army and Navy leaders like McArthur, Nimitz, Halsey and others.  Where my disappointment interupted the sets accurate progression to the final stages of the Pacific theatre conflict is when I put in disk #5 which totally misrepresents what the table of contents indicates is to be shown.  There was no battle of Leyte Gulf, the battle of the Philippine Sea, the major snafu of ""Bull"" Halsey or any of the topics listed in the sets episode content leading to the end of the war.  So, this turned out to be and incomplete and total ommission of what this 2009 Madacy Entertainment production claimed to be; ""The complete and unique story of the last great naval campaign in history"".  I don't know how a professional video manufacturing company could make such a blunder.  Maybe they don't really know or understand the history they claim to be showcasing?",1262217600,10,1435,4.758064516129032

8341360,3,B001TH37OY,"The dvd's were in excellent shape and arrived in a timely manner. The content was presented very well, but as documentaries go I have seen better. There seemed to a great deal of the same film clips that were repeated in different areas of the dvd to protray a different story line. All in all it was OK>",1381190400,,304,4.258620689655173
8341361,1,B001TH37OY,"The box art should tip you off. An Army P-40 at wavetop altitude with guns blazing beside some unidentifiable warship. The video is equally incomprehensible, spotty narration with anachronistic footage, dwelling on some battles while ignoring other important ones. The scenes do not remotely match the chapter index and will confuse the eager student and exasperate the knowledgeable expert. South Pacific footage illustrating the Aleutian campaign, even the famous footage of the B-24 hit by flak over Germany to illustrate Midway. A hopeless mess created by non-enthusiasts who apparently understand nothing about the Pacific war.",1320019200,,632,5.663157894736842
8341362,2,B001TH37OY,"What's sad about this CD set is the narration, the information, and several of the interviews are very good - but there are no use of maps to more clearly see what happened in most of the battles.  As the viewer you are near completely reliant on your listening skills as the battle footage makes little sense - and in some cases doesn't really follow along with the narration all that well.  I recall seeing Corsair carrier footage while they were documenting the battle of Midway?  The CD set isn't a total loss, as the information is very well put together, but they fell short on the editing, the footage, and the background music for sure.

It is obvious that they spent a long time putting this together - I hope that they update the CD set and make it better.",1294617600,3,766,4.411347517730497
8341363,3,B001TH37OY,"I'll keep it short, but the documentary re-uses scenes like crazy.  It's not uncommon to see the same scene twice or three times within a 2 minute time span.  There was at least one clip I think I saw over 10 or 15 times over the entire series.

Plus, the scenes are short and are largely just generic background shots for the commentary.  Very rarely do they comment on the actual clip.

Also, they skip over a lot of the famous battles leading up to the end of the war.  You're better off looking elswhere for a good WWII documentary.",1291593600,3,536,4.31
8341364,2,B001TH37OY,"Little of this documentary is well done, although the first disk does cover Japans rise to power and why it attacked the US and how the US eventually got involved in the war in the pacific and the battles that followed...it missed so much after!  Many of the greatest moments of WWII's war in the Pacific were totally missed.  Iwo Jima, and Tarawa just to name two - how could they completely miss these two horrific island battles.  In fact the documentary never even mentions the US's island hopping strategy they employed to defeat the Japanese. Doesn't even detail, the delivery of the atom bomb to Tainan Island by the USS Indianapolis that eventually lead to the end of the war and the surrender of Japan!  How bad is that?

Yes there were interviews of men and women that fought in it and also archived war footage many people, including me, may have never seen before...the documentary was incomplete and terribly done.  The people that put this together should not be making documentaries.  No maps!  How can you possibly have a war documentary and not include maps to show the movements of the opposing sides to help the viewer visualize just exactly what it is you are describing!  Pathetic and poorly done!

The last disk(disk 5) has nothing that is listed on it, like the Battle of Truk Island, Leyte Gulf, Hulsey's Bluster.

Is has very few still photo's in it, that could have helped flesh it out.  Instead the just constantly use the same movie footage over and over again ad nauseum until you just get bored to tears.

Amazon should, and any other stores selling this, should stop selling it.  It is that bad and the fact that the last disk does not even have on it what is suppose to be on it!  Do not buy this - waste of time and money.",1277596800,2,1755,4.5094936708860756
8341365,3,B001TH37OY,"As the only other reviewer (so far) has said, the first 4 of 5 discs are what was expected and pretty good.  However for the last disc, on the case they list ""Acts"" or chapters titled things like ""The great turkey shoot, Last chance of the tin can navy at Leyte gulf, Halseys blunder, etc"", while the disc actually has ""Floating chrysanthemums, Where are the japs, The generals blunder, etc"" covering the invasion of Okinawa versus battles near Leyte gulf.  I got this hoping for more of the info on the sea ship battles versus land invasion stories, so I'm not totally happy.  With more than 1 person saying the same thing it sounds like someone punched a wrong button and didn't catch it before hitting the ""Go"" button on the production run, so beware.",1263859200,2,754,4.57037037037037
