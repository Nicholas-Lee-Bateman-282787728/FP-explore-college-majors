Even though I am an experienced jeweler, I found many little tips and tricks in this, that it was VERY MUCH worth it.",1437782400,,265,4.428571428571429
8261536,5,B001689LG4,"Metal Techniques of Bronze Age Masters: Ring DVD is fabulous.  Victoria Lansford knows exactly how to teach a class and this ability shines through on this DVD.  She even anticipates what might go wrong and tells you how it can be fixed.  Nothing truly can take place of actually going to one of her workshops; but, her DVD certainly comes as close as you can get.  Just from viewing this DVD, below is my rendition of Victoria's poison ring.",1427068800,3,442,4.556962025316456
