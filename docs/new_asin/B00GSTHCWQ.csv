6108175,1,B00GSTHCWQ,"Not so much a movie as a series of edits randomly strung together, periodically interrupted by people snorting cocaine. No amount of drugs on the viewers part will make it even remotely entertaining.",1392163200,3,199,5.0606060606060606
6108176,2,B00GSTHCWQ,"This movie is soft porn. The sex is way more than gratuitous. There is no haunting. The story is incidental. It leaves way more questions than it answers but I don't care because the ""story"" isn't interesting or cohesive and really makes no sense. Do not watch this for the story. You will be disappointed. It really is a soft porn. And not even a good one. I only give it two stars because of rumer Willis. The only good thing in the movie.",1391904000,9,441,4.261904761904762
6108177,1,B00GSTHCWQ,This is something child molesters and weed heads enjoy... because real life isn't enough for them. Sick. And boring as all hell.,1390953600,2,128,4.863636363636363
6108178,5,B00GSTHCWQ,"I got to see an advance screening of this film and was impressed by the detail and film work, but was surprised by the level of eroticism (done with almost no nudity, sans a bare bottom) which didn't overpower the film as a whole. But, really, did nearly EVERYONE in the film have to constantly use drugs like tobacco, alcohol and cocaine! Still, it was entertaining. (Not for the kids, needless to say!)

By the way, avoid digital, go with the proven physical DVD format. I've got my two copies ordered!",1390348800,,504,4.538461538461538
6108179,1,B00GSTHCWQ,"I checked your reviews and this seemed to happen to other people where the video would freeze and the audio kept going... I highly doubt that that was part of the film! I am not happy with spending money on something that doesn't do what it's supposed to and I'm sure others aren't either. Your Amazon, a HUGE corporation with tons of money so you need to be held responsible for this and fix it, A.S.A.P., as in digital time, not old days analog and paper time. Refund my money on this movie NOW!!!

I'm generally happy with Amazon products and I know in the digital world things can go wrong, but I shouldn't have to pay for it.

6108180,2,B00GSTHCWQ,"During play, the video would freeze or appear to freeze for long periods and the sound kept going. Was it supposed to do this or wasn't just a problem with my rental? Not a good experience.",1389916800,,189,4.277777777777778
6108226,2,B00GSTHCWQ,"Students preparing for a Psychology experiment...nowhere near professional, student Lucky is more prepared for an evening vamping in a nightclub than a Psych test. More than unbelievable..It COULD have been much better, but fell apart in the drugs and drinking..",1412121600,,262,5.575

6108228,3,B00GSTHCWQ,"If you like psychological thrillers&ghosts, you'll like this movie. Main character  played by Taylor Cole is the academic with a hidden agenda. Rumer Willis plays a convincing bad girl which is different from the nerdy/artsy intellectual types she often portrays. The only problem I had with the movie was the excessive drug use.",1405900800,,329,5.2075471698113205
6108229,2,B00GSTHCWQ,For college kids use A empty house that one of the girls family owns they start as always with telling who they are with A camcorder running then some weird things start to happen like there's A ghost girl walking around. The only thing that I could make any sense of this was that some one our all of them had something to do with that house which you see in someone having memory of the past.,1399852800,,394,4.12987012987013
6108230,2,B00GSTHCWQ,"I was disappointed in this movie and I thought it had potenial with Rumer Willis, Billy Zane and Dominic Purcell. But I believe this movie was concentrating on soft porn, drugs and alcohol more than the haunting it self.",1399420800,2,220,4.666666666666667
6108231,5,B00GSTHCWQ,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Plenty of creepy scenes.  Yes, of course the usual teen make-out scenes, drinking and drugs,  but pretty mild compared to other movies I've seen.  Five-stars from me.",1396224000,,195,4.818181818181818
6108232,1,B00GSTHCWQ,"The plot and the actions of the characters make no sense. It's like it was edited wrong, or more likely, the director just wanted certain things to happen, but didn't want to bother writing scenes to make it coherent. Worse than that though is that it's really boring. Nothing remotely scary happens. The ""ghost"" just walks around like a Gothic high school student reading poetry.
The acting is decent and so is the cinematography, and I will never complain about watching hot girls in their underwear, but generally it was a big waste of time.",1393891200,,544,4.7368421052631575
6108233,2,B00GSTHCWQ,"This movie takes us on the journey as four (yes FOUR (4),...not 5 as EVERY synopsis says) psychology students are randomly grouped (by name) together to perform an experiment dealing with ESP.  They are tasked with staying awake for 48 hours and the test must be done at a secluded location.  One of the students, Becket (Taylor Core) just happens to have an abandoned home that perfectly meets the requirements set forth, so they venture on.

Let me be honest,...this house it right smack in the middle of LA.  It shows the iconic HOLLYWOOD sign in the background from time to time, so wouldn't you think her parents would have torn this place down and sold it or something by now?!  I mean, I live in Louisiana, so I can't exactly say would the land would go for, but really, it's gotta be a pretty chunk of change, don't you think?  Also, who's paying the bills on this place?  It definitely has electricity and water, and since they turn on the furnace for heat, I'm assuming that is gas as well?  I could be wrong, but why would you keep the utilities on in this place?  Doesn't seem right.  Not to mention the property taxes they probably get stuck with every year?!  But  back to the review......

They all arrive at the house for the experiment and this is when we get our first indication that none of the students are friends.  Eliot (Ryan Donowho) as apparently spent some time setting the place up for all the requirements that this experiment is going to take.  Multiply cameras have been installed throughout the place and 4-5 monitors have been set up in the ""control room"".  Apparently Eliot has some sort of ties with ghost hunters of the 1920's, because the equipment all seems to have come from that time period.  Even the computer they're using looks like some sort of laptop from the 1970's.  How it transmits video, I have no idea?!  But everything is set and they all group together to introduce themselves and begin the experiment.

Becket begins by pulling out a camcorder and filming each person.  Graves (Toby Hemingway) takes this time to be the ""cool guy"" and talk a bunch of nonsense, while Lucky (Rumor Willis) uses it as an opportunity to get baked out of her mind.  Hipster, Eliot is completely appalled at how Graves and Lucky are acting and attempts to talk smooth with Becket.

Again, I have to break in here.  I know NOTHING about cocaine, but from what I've heard, this stuff can be quite pricey.  Lucky CONTINUOUSLY pulls bags of the stuff from her purse (or whatever it is she's carrying with her).  It would seem to me that there is approximately $100K worth of the stuff lying around.  But again, I'm no expert.

As Lucky continues to get high they begin the experiment.  Graves goes first.  They strap some sort of welders goggles and some ""Beats by Dre"" style headphones on his head and go to work.  Now this is one place I got confused.  They were supposed to see a card on the computer screen and he was supposed to say what they card was through ESP?  I'm probably wrong, because they would say the name of the card, then he'd repeat it back to them?  Regardless, something else happens and Graves gets freaked and he runs off and forces Becket to take a turn.  During her part, something begins to happen to her and she freaks out.  Afterwards they all find themselves back in the, let's call it a common room, where they proceed to take MASSIVE amounts of cocaine, pot, and alcohol and start making a sex tape.  Yes,...you read that correctly.  It totally comes out of nowhere, but somewhere in the middle, Lucky passes out and somehow, Eliot and Becket find themselves up in one of the bedrooms.  You can imagine what is taking place, but then Eliot sees something in the mirror and proceeds to flip out.  Another question I had to ask myself was:  How in the world can Becket, a girl that has NEVER done cocaine, possibly stay completely alert, while a junkie like Lucky passes out?  Just another inconsistency.

The movie continues with them doing the experiments after awakening from their haze.  It's pretty much a continuation of their work previous to the orgy.  Graves and Becket both take turns again and something happens to both AGAIN.  It is during this time that we know the ""twist"" that we'd expected from the get-go IS, in fact, what we thought it was.  I won't ruin it for you, because you might want to see for yourself, but the involved characters HAD to know.  Considering what happened, they would have been like 10-11 years old?

The reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of a single star is the fact that it was filmed well.  It was, at the very least a quality produced indie title.  The acting was good, the set was ok, but the story was pretty bad.  The ending was even worse, because the cops come out of NO WHERE?!

Final Verdict:  PASS!  It's nowhere near good enough for the time it takes to watch.

6108234,4,B00GSTHCWQ,"It's definitely a movie for adults. At the same time, I think it gives a realistic view of how this kind of situation might play out.",1392336000,,133,4.153846153846154
6108235,1,B00GSTHCWQ,"I just watched this on movies on demand with my cable company. The movie was so STUPID!!! They showed more of them doing drugs and licking each other than they did of any ""ghost"". This movie was a complete waste of my time. They were only 4 people first of all not 5 and they under my impression were in college but referred to as teenagers. Then things happened but then they didn't happen, then apparently some of it really happened. Basically young adults doing drugs and licking each other and then once in a while a ghost had a monologue. A ghost that died as a child but was an adult as a ghost? First ghost in cinematic history that aged after death hahaha!",1392249600,6,664,4.32
8626912,1,B00GSTHCWQ,"Saw this on YouTube.  This would have been an interesting concept if the scriptwriter had included a plot.  The boyfriend and I spent the entire movie yelling, ""How much cocaine do they have?"" and ""I think you guys would feel better after a hot meal!"" If you enjoy endless cuts of drug abuse, the copious use of f-bombs, and nonsensical lesbian soft porn, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, save yourself and go watch Ernest Saves Christmas or something.",1518652800,,457,4.7
8626913,1,B00GSTHCWQ,"Awful movie. More adult sex tape than haunting. Characters are moody, obnoxious for the sake of stage directions. Badly written student-esque script that got released on to DVD.  Save your money.",1502496000,,195,5.290322580645161

8626916,1,B00GSTHCWQ,"I'm in between I hate it and I don't like it.
It made me feel like I was in high school again!! If you like good acting BUT they do nothing but yell and scream at each other, do drugs every other minute and don't mind an almost 20 minute make out session between 2 girls while they get down to their underwear then THIS is the movie for you!
The flashbacks are interesting and tell you back story but they make no sense until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The plot was ALL OVER the place and what was up with that ghost girl?
*SPOILERS*
HOW OH HOW did the older ghost girl GET to be older if she died as a child? I was SO confused at first but then the scene morphed into that... WELL I'd NEVER watch this again. Its horrible",1474675200,,729,3.9659863945578233

8626920,2,B00GSTHCWQ,"Went from interesting, to a line of coke, to less interesting, to a line of coke, to lame, to a line of coke, to really, really lame. To a line of coke.

You think a Hollywood filmmaking team would know how much coke the human body can tolerate before your heart explodes.

Wait for Netflix or Amazon Prime on this one - definitely don't waste $5. This is one of the rare horror films I actually just could not even finish watching. Turned it off as the story progressed, literally, as I described it.",1429142400,2,501,4.319148936170213
8626921,3,B00GSTHCWQ,Not well developed characters.  More cocaine than content.  I can't really say much about the acting because an actor can only do so much with a weak script.  This could have been much better if there had been less partying and more believable situations.,1418083200,,255,4.75
