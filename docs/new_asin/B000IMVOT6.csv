8146484,4,B000IMVOT6,"DVD failed towards the end of the video. Needed this information for a graduate course. The film is very compelling and extremely relevant to today's dilemma of ""achievement"" gap.",1375574400,,179,5.206896551724138
8146485,5,B000IMVOT6,"Excellent! I loved it, but then of course I would. I am from Shaker and knew many of the people in the video. I am proud of what my community has done, and I grew up immersed and believing in the Shaker ideology. I purchased the tape for obvious reasons -- to keep a part of our history. I also bought it to use in my ""World of the Learner"" education course that I teach as well, as a platform to talk about race and schooling and what is possible. It would also be a good piece for communities trying to heal their racial divide, or for those teaching about the evolution of race and socio-economic relations in America. Very well done.",1230940800,,637,4.229508196721311
