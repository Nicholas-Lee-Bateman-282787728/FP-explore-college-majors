8163632,3,B000LQHLK0,I can't say if I like this film or not as I did not watch it since it did not have any subtitle options.,1524528000,,104,3.375
8163633,4,B000LQHLK0,"An outstanding vehicle for Jacques Brel to display his talent as the most hilarious idiot since Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau.  The humor is Gallic, with a few Pythonesque moments thrown in.  Ventura is solid as the hit man who cannot fathom his increasing misfortune.  My students love it in spite of the movie's rather bloody beginning (two assassinations).  For fans of Black Adder, Python, or even Jeeves & Wooster, not to be missed.",1203724800,6,441,5.0
8163634,2,B000LQHLK0,"If you ever wondered why Billy Wilder's last movie, Buddy Buddy was so weak despite a great cast and a great premise, checking out the Francis Veber-scripted/Eduardo Molinaro-directed French original L'Emmerdeur/A Pain in the A** gives some pretty solid pointers - it's not very good either, seemingly too satisfied at the cleverness of the conceit to really mine it for all its worth. Lino Ventura is the mob hitman whose attempts to set up for a hit for his unforgiving bosses are constantly interrupted by suicidal Jacques Brel in the next hotel room. Unfortunately the first 40 minutes are pretty flat scene setting, with the film taking forever to get into gear and then only cruising fairly gently with the occasional light smiles rather than belly laughs along the way. Veber at least would go onto do much better work.

TFI's French DVD does boast a good widescreen transfer with English subtitles.",1179532800,2,906,4.9605263157894735
