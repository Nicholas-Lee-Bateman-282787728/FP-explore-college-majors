8568068,5,B00BGF7VDC,"Flicker Alley continues to impress. This time they've put together five silent films from 1923-1925 including Le Brasier Ardent (The Burning Crucible), Kean, Feu Mathias Pascal (The Late Mathias Pascal), Gribiche, and Les Nouveaux Messieurs (The New Gentlemen).

Films Albatros was a Parisian film company that featured films of Russian immigrants who fled Russia following the October 1917 revolution. Their work, influenced by French and Russian filmmakers, became a hugely influential movement in their own right.

The five films include the work of Ivan Mosjoukine (actor/writer/director), Alexandre Volkoff, Marcel L'Herbier, and Jacques Feyder. The films are diverse and always entertaining and interesting. Humorous, experimental, groundbreaking, fascinating--each film is worth your time.

There are 660 minutes in this collection, and it also includes an informative essay by Lenny Borger. For fans of Jacques Feyder, there is, in addition, a bonus scene from Gribiche. And, for fans of film scores, Timothy Brock, Robert Israel, Neil Brand, Antonio Coppola and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra are featured.

Kudos to Flicker Alley for making these films available. As usual, the prints are superb, and the entire presentation is classy.

NOTE: I received a review copy in exchange for a fair and honest review.",1421625600,3,1327,5.615
8568069,5,B00BGF7VDC,"Beautiful presentations of restored silent French (although directed by Russians) films. The picture quality is fairly clean with only a few specks & lines that let you know this is old film.  But is minor wear for their age.  I indicate the focus is sharp, but only ""Gribiche"" is HD sharp which may be why no Blu-ray is released. The accompanying music is well prepared.
The discs default to English subtitles under the original French title & dialogue cards.  But these are not hard subtitles, they can be removed in the menu set-up if you are fluent in French.
All of these films are new to U.S. home video, so I will talk about the films as well.

Disc 1:
""LE BRASIER ARDENT"" (The Burning Crucible) June 8, 1923 (filmed in 1922) 108 minutes (the booklet & jacket say 110, but that is wrong).  Color tints.  Music by Neil Brand.
Starring Ivan Mosjoukine, Nicolas Koline, Nathalie Lissenko
The film was restored on 35mm film back in 1997 by Cinematheque Royale de Belgique, this new 2013 digital scan is off of that negative.
The film master is sharp and clear with perfect contrast. Pre-print wear is quite minor on this film.
The color tints, which serve the film very well, are based on a surviving tinted & toned nitrate print.
The original main titles have been lost and re-created for the 1997 restoration.
- The first 30 minutes of this film are amazing!  Full of surreal nightmares, & secret societies that equal anything Max Fleischer did in his heyday of Cartoons.  There is also a bedroom full of gadgets that would make Buster Keaton happy.  Then suddenly the director loses all creativity and we drop into a slow melodrama of lost love.  Just why the director, Ivan Mosjoukine, lost steam is anyones guess, but the liner notes state that this film lost him his career as a director.  It was a resounding commercial failure.  Since Ivan was also one of the stars of this film, maybe it was too much for him.  Ivan's acting career would continue onward, and he appears in the next two films in this set.

Disc 2
""KEAN ou DESORDRE & GENIE"" (Kean or Wilderness and Genius) Feb 15, 1924 (filmed in 1923) 136 minutes, B&W.  Music by Robert Israel.
Starring Ivan Mosjoukine, Nicolas Koline, Nathalie Lissenko
This film was restored on 35mm film back in 1989 by Renee Lichtig, this new 2013 digital scan is off of that negative.
The film master is sharp & clear, with perfect contrast but occasional flicker. However the masters used for the restoration negative show a bit more wear with negative splices and occasional lines.  Wear is a bit more heavier around the original reel changes (about every 10-12 minutes).  There are re-issue reel change cue marks every 20-22 minutes in the top right corner, if these were from the original issue they would have been every 10-12 minutes.
No color tints, just beautiful B&W.
- The first 20 minutes is a basic filming of a performance of ""Romeo and Juliette"" by the cast. This may have been interesting in 1924 when some audience members didn't have access to a Shakespearian Theater, but today we have seen this enough to speed past the silent performances.  The real story starts after this, the story of a Shakespearian actor, Keen, on the run from creditors and pursuing his true love.  Told with the right mix of humor and pathos, this is an enjoyable tale.
The movie has no surreal or magical elements as the first film, the acting carries this story, but there are many optical effects to show how cinema technology was advancing.  Ind Ivan Mosjoukine shows his ability in changing acting style between playing Kean and Kean as Romeo or Hamlet.  One wonders if some
The music pieces chosen to accompany this tale are familiar classical pieces.

Disc 3
""FEAU MATHIS PASCAL"" (The Late Mathias Pascal) Feb 12, 1926 (filmed in 1925) 171 minutes, Color tints. Music by Timothy Broch, recorded in a live performance on June 28, 2009 by The Orchestra of the Municipal Theater of Bologna.
Starring Ivan Mosjoukine, Marcelle Pradot, Lois Moran, Marthe Belot
This film was printed in 1964 off of the original negative.  Sadly that original negative is now lost.  The color tints were added based on a vintage Nitrate print deposited at the Cinematheque in 1958. Unlike the other previous films, there are still B&W sections to this film.
The image is HD sharp with excellent contrast and there is a separate Blu-ray release:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Late-Mathias-Pascal-Feu-Mathias-Pascal-Blu-ray/dp/B00AA3MHLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Late Mathias Pascal (Feu Mathias Pascal ) [Blu-ray</a>] .  The negative shows some wear, but is overall clean.  We are fortunate that this 1964 print was made while the negative was in existence.
- This tragic comedy of epic length (almost 3 hours) is told in three parts.  The first half of the film tells the stories of how Mathias Pascal searches for ""Liberty"" in life by first getting into a bad marriage and then by taking up gambling.  The title of this movie doesn't apply until the second half of the film. After a dead body is mis-identified as that of Mathias, Mathias takes the opportunity at anonymity to leave his old life behind and takes off for Rome to start a new life.
This would be Ivan Mosjoukine's last film for Films Albatros, he would try to pursue a career at the new larger Cine-France-Film where film buffs feel his creativity started to decline.

Disc 4
""GRIBICHE"" April 2, 1926 (filmed in 1925) 112 minutes, Color tints.  Music by Mont Alto Picture Orchestra.
Starring Jean Forest, Francoise Rosay, Cecil Guyon, Rolla Normand, Armand Dufour
This is a new 2009 digital scan off of two vintage 1920's nitrate 35mm TINTED prints.  The prints are in almost pristine shape, and they were printed off of the camera negatives before any damage had occurred to them.
It gets no better than this.  This presentation is worthy of a Blu-ray release.  The only drawback is that the picture is slightly window-boxed.
- The story is a melodrama about a poor boy who returns a lost wallet to a rich woman. In repayment, the rich woman approaches the poor boy's mother and offers to adopt the boy and give him a rich life.  The trouble is that the rich life is very regimented and not fun.
These are the dramas that evoked many ""Our Gang"" (The Little Rascals) rich kid rescue comedies such as ""Washee Ironee"" and ""Free Wheelin'"".  One just wishes for Spanky and Stymie to come to this kid's rescue.

BONUS SCENE:
A 2:48 scene that was in the foreign export prints but was not in the French Domestic prints.  We can not be sure why this scene was in the export prints and not in the two French domestic prints, the existing dialogue card is in French!

Disc 5
""LES NOUVEAUX MESSIEURS"" (The New Gentlemen) April 5, 1929 (filmed in 1928 but delayed due to a censor ban requiring some excisions of political humor) 124 minutes (the booklet claims 135 minutes which might be the original uncensored version). The censored footage is lost. Music by Antonio Coppola.  B&W
Starring Gaby Morlay, Henry Roussell, Albert Prejean
A new print was made in 1960 off of the original negative followed by a fine grain master which only had flash frame titles. In 1990, Renee Lichtig prepared new French intertitles based upon the flash titles and prepared a new printing negative.  In 2011 Cinematheque francaise made fresh preservation material incorporating the 1990 titles.
The image is sharp enough with perfect contrast, but not as sharp as the previous two films in this set.  I wonder what happened to that original negative used in 1960.
This appears to be a tele-cine transfer and I have some issues with MOTION BLUR at the 17 minute mark lasting about 4 minutes. The problem returns for the last 10 minutes of the film.  In these sections of the film every video frame contains two film frames creating a double image. The rest of the film only has every third frame containing two images and is not as noticeable when watched at normal speed.
There are some brief appearances of Nitrate deterioration at 9:00, 54:40, and 106:00.  Fortunately they are brief and do not wipe out the entire frame. These are probably around reel changes.
- The story starts out as a love story between a stage electrician and a dancer, but quickly becomes a political tale of labor v.s. government as the transport drivers go on strike.  The electrician and dancer get caught up in the labor dispute.
This 1928 production is just calling out for sound, as noise is used to evoke some humor.  As a speech is about to be made, someone turns on a music box and drowns out the speaker.  This is convayed by showing the listeners moving their heads back & forth to the rhythm of the music and close-ups of the music box.  At this point the new music track falls short and should have switched to a music score more appropriate for the music box.  This was the only time I was disappointed in the soundtrack.
Some of the humor is still intact, but i wonder what the French government made them cut out.

BONUS MATERIAL:
This set comes with an extensive 28 page booklet giving background on the directors and their films.

One complaint: I wish the English subtitles were yellow and not white as the white over the original French dialogue cards tends to be difficult to read if the original cards have lettering from top to bottom.
Commentary tracks would also have been nice.",1410912000,10,9395,4.769135802469136
8568070,5,B00BGF7VDC,"There's so much to admire in this collection that was surely a labor of love for Film Preservation Associates and all those involved in bringing these 5 films back to public conciousness. Not only are we treated to 5 virtually forgotten French films of the silent era but we are given a glimpse at the other side of the Russian cinematic coin. Say Russian silent cinema to any film enthusiast and they'll immediate think Soviet silent cinema with its trilogy of great directors Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Alexander Dovzhenko. Those with a little more knowledge will mention pre-Revolution Russia cinema with such names as Evgueni Bauer and Ladislav Starewicz. However hardly anyone talks about or is probably even aware of the Russian filmmakers and artists who fled to the West settling mostly in Paris which makes sense as that's where a huge Russian colony already was thanks to Serge Diaghilev and the internationally famous Ballets Russes. There were a large number of them and they brought lots of skill and polish to the French cinema of the time. Until this set came out, I was completely unfamiliar with Films Albatros who produced all these movies. Now I'm glad to have made their acquaintance.

Of the 5 films in the set, 3 feature Russian born actor-director Ivan Mosjoukine (1889-1939). The one film he directed, the avant-garde THE BURNING CRUCIBLE, was just not my cup of tea. I admire the skill and the daring but now that I've seen it, I don't need to see it again. The same does not hold true of the two other Mosjoukine films KEANE and especially THE LATE MATHIAS PASCAL. KEANE (1924), about the legendary stage actor Edmund Keane is very similar to John Barrymore's BEAU BRUMMEL released the same year. Lavish sets and period costumes with an incredible visual scene set in a tavern. The acting is over the top but then it's meant to be.  The real jewel is THE LATE MATHIAS PASCAL which is nearly 3 hours long but is never boring. It has great use of Italian locations and some amazing visual compositions. I can't wait to watch that one again. The remaining two films are by the French filmmaker Jacques Feyder (1885-1948)  best remembered in America for THE KISS with Greta Garbo. GIBICHE is a well made tale about a young French boy who is adopted by an American socialite. It features Jean Forest, the young star of an earlier Feyder film VISAGE D'ENFANTS. THE NEW GENTLEMEN is sophisticated silent comedy at its finest. The films are lovingly restored with proper tints and a number of fine scores from different composers. Yet another winner from Flicker Alley.",1407888000,8,2602,4.8165548098434
8568071,5,B00BGF7VDC,Kudos to TCM for bringing these silent movies to TV.  I especially enjoyed Gribiche--a story about a working class boy in Paris who is given a chance to move up in society.  The movie did not show its age of almost ninety years.  What a treasure.,1373068800,6,246,4.304347826086956
8568072,5,B00BGF7VDC,I received my copy early since I ordered directly from Flicker Alley at a discount. If you are debating whether to take the plunge and purchase these dvds I advise you to do so. You will not be disappointed. Randy,1368057600,8,213,4.35
