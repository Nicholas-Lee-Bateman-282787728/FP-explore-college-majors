5553256,5,B00B2TTXX8,"I am a huge fan of well written anime's with both story and some true based history. This series had great graphics, well thought out story lines, and even some historical plots.

I strongly recommend this to anime fans.",1369094400,3,220,4.641025641025641
5553257,5,B00B2TTXX8,"This DVD contains 6 episodes. The tone of the OVA is fairly different from Season 1 & 2. There is a fair amount of levity and I have to admit that I caught myself laughing on more than one occasion. But this is by no mean a comedy. Expect to see some of the scenes several time since the majority of episodes are the retelling of the same event from various character perspective. This OVA expands on the Hakuoki universe offering a deeper insight into the various protagonist personalities and motivations: in other words character development. There is also plenty of action.
Language options are original Japanese and English dub along with English subtitles. I personally prefer the Japanese vocal cast. Special features are limited: clean opening and closing as well as a few previews on Disc 1.
Also, this take place prior to Record of the Jade Blood (season 2) so the character are still wearing their traditional Japanese garbs (thankfully). If you have not seen season 2, this OVA can be watched regardless.
I enjoyed watching this and would definitely recommend (especially after watching Hakuoki Record of the Jade Blood)",1368835200,15,1132,4.901041666666667
5553258,5,B00B2TTXX8,"This is the OVA side-story for the Hakuoki TV series. The sound and animation quality are about the same as in the TV series, both of which are really great. Each episode stars a different member of the Shinsengumi, following the stories from one of the games that hasn't had an English release...yet! (I've got my fingers crossed that it comes over eventually.) So technically none of this is actually filler. (Phew!) Rather than focus on battles, these episodes focus on Chizuru's relationships with the guys. No matter which relationship you're shipping, you're bound to get your money's worth of enjoyment!

Timeline-wise, this takes place toward the end of the first season. So don't worry if you haven't seen seasons 2 or 3 yet.

As with the other Hakuoki DVDs, this got the full dub treatment. I personally love the original Japanese vocal cast, but the English voice actors certainly do an excellent job as well.

If you ever wanted to know what the Shinsengumi were doing in Kyoto when they weren't fighting rogue samurai, then this is definitely a must see!",1366329600,21,1067,4.851648351648351
8561632,5,B00B2TTXX8,"I have all the Hakuoki discs so had to buy this one and wasn't disappointed. I loved Saiyuki but this story is closer to actually historic events. Interesting characters and I love the voice actors, I'm not a fan of subs. Well worth the money spent.",1493424000,,249,4.434782608695652

Yeah it is a gamble but when you're a hardcore fan of anything, its a risk you are willing to take especially if $$ is tight. I recomed it.",1447459200,,299,4.0
8561636,5,B00B2TTXX8,Awesome series love it hope they make a season 4,1444176000,,48,3.9
8561637,3,B00B2TTXX8,"While Seasons 1, 2 and 3 pass for a strangely compelling rendition of history's underdogs, the Shinsengumi, the OVA collection is a bit of a throwaway. You probably don't need to own it. The episodes are stuff that they scrounged from the cutting room floor, and are strung together in a rather chaotic, sometimes repetitive fashion. There are no new stories or characters in the OVA, and certainly no swashbuckling action. Instead, each episode pairs the girl romancing with a different member of the Shinsengumi, mostly in a domestic setting. I would have enjoyed it. If I was 10.",1441670400,,582,4.888888888888889

8561639,5,B00B2TTXX8,"I frist saw this on Youtube. I also saw 3 series that goes with it. I like this anime. The story and artwork is good.
I think the OVA should be part of the 3rd series. At the end of 3rd series. There not too many anime does this way(at lest what I have seen). I wish they put all 3 series and OVA together as a Blueray/Dvd combo!",1417824000,3,329,3.782608695652174
