2561390,1,B000FDFOTE,"As David Walker & A.S. Templeton have pointed out, This ""box set"" consists of 1 DVD (featuring episodes 1 through 6 of the 1st season of W.I.T.C.H.), four empty DVD ""filler"" cases, & the ""box"" for the ""set"".

The true rip-off of all this is:  Then you have to buy the other four discs, separately.  Even if they sell the other discs at $5 each, with approximately $5 for S & H, you pay nearly $80 (assuming you paid the $25 for the first DVD & $5 S & H) for the WHOLE SET.  That is an expensive ""BOOTLEGGED"" set.  Even great shows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Stargate SG-1, and MacGyver aren't that expensive, per season.

The question you have to ask is:  Is it worth it?  My opinion is NO!!",1164499200,,695,4.212121212121212
2561391,1,B000FDFOTE,"Waited over a month to get the box set which only has 1 dvd and 5 blank cases. The print quality is a dead give away that this is not a real release. There's no way I would have paid for what I got, but it was a gift for my daughter and she wants to keep it. If it were mine it would be back in the mail tomorrow for a refund.",1164499200,,326,3.4794520547945207
2561392,1,B000FDFOTE,"W.I.T.C.H. features of course wonderful, girl-positive stories and situations. My 8-year old loves the characters, even though some situations may be a little adult or intense for the preteen set. These girls might best watch with their parents. New viewers should be advised that there is no Hogwarts-style magic, witchcraft, or sorcery per se, despite the W.I.T.C.H. acronym (derived from the first letters of the principal characters' names). Think fairies and elves crossed with Power Rangers.

However, even though we've been asked to restrict comments to content, context and comparison, I must address the practical aspects of obtaining this DVD ""set"".

The shipset includes *only* the first volume of a five-volume set. It's in a boxed-set format with four empty/blank cases and one actual DVD. Artwork is depressingly murky and semilegible, with cheap mud-colored boxset cardboard. The single disk in my purchase came loose in its case during shipping and so has minor marring of the optical surface. There may also be an irregularity in the regional coding of the disk (plays on a Region 1 DVD player, but not in my computer's DVD drive). Its publisher LaceWing Media may or may not be legit, but this DVD's got a whiff of ""bootleg"" about it.

Note the doublespeak of ""W.I.T.C.H Season 1 Collector's Set Featuring Volume 1"" and the depiction of a boxed set; I was not the only one taken in by such sleazy listing techniques; shame on dvd-galleria. They definitely have taken advantage of the sorry North American mal-marketing of W.I.T.C.H.

On the bright side, one can order the first 3 DVD volumes of W.I.T.C.H. from amazon.co.uk. Each volume features brilliant, lively jacket artwork and a reasonable price. These would be Region 2 PAL DVDs, incompatible with standard players and analog NTSC TVs sold in North America.",1164412800,5,1832,5.117056856187291
2561393,1,B000FDFOTE,"After approximatelty 6 weeks of inquiries back and forth to DVD Galleria, My order arrived and consisted of Five blank, empty DVD cases and a carboard box painted black to ""resemble"" the one in the picture above.  Mine may be an isolated case, but, considering the ""bootleg"" theories and the fact that, yes, Disney is not behind this release, if you want to purchase this DVD, use caution.

Other than that, if this DVD was real, and my order was 100% fulfilled, I would have probably been happy with the purchase.  Ordered as a christmas gift and the person I was buying it for loves this show, and they got me hooked.",1164153600,2,619,4.508928571428571
2561394,5,B000FDFOTE,"not knowing exactly what to expect.  I noticed that it was on Pre-order for quite some time so that didn't help.  After wrestling with myself I decided to go ahead and place ""the order.""  At first I was skeptical...that is until the set arrived in the mail today.  I am soooo glad I opted to pick this up.  The case comes with Volume 1. You can definitely tell that LaceWing brought some originality to the table with cover of Volume 1 and the case.  I guess they were going for some type of old book theme??  Anyway, it was awesome. It definitely worked.  As for the DVD itself, it features episodes 1-6.  The video and sound is perfect (thank God!).  Basically, if you're a fan of the show, you gotta pick this up.  I hope the other volumes are released soon...I want to fill up my WITCH case ASAP!",1163462400,,800,4.302013422818792
2561395,4,B000FDFOTE,"W.I.T.C.H. is the story of five girls who discover they have elemental abilities, and are tied to an ancient battle from long ago. One is charged with holding the key to the power, and they become the fairy-like Guardians. Along the way, they gain allies in the form of Caleb, a rebel leader, Blunk, a Passling thief, and more. Lurking on the other side of the Veil, however, is Phobos, who wants nothing more than to steal his sister's powers and permanently rule Meridian.

The series diverts from the comic on many points, such as the power levels of the Guardians and Yan Lin remaining alive, but it remains more or less true to the spirit of the series.  There aren't many clear-cut victories, and sometimes, they can even lose a battle without realizing they lost it. It's realistic, it's smart, and it's fun.",1163462400,,815,4.652777777777778
2561396,5,B000FDFOTE,"W.I.T.C.H. is originally based off the popular girls comic.  Although it may seem like a show that's just for girls, the reality is this show has a much wider appeal due to a perfect blend of comedy, drama, and action.  Unlike other current female cartoons *cough Winx Club* the characters deal with more real life situations, thus making them more real and natural.",1163030400,,366,4.7936507936507935
2561397,5,B000FDFOTE,"Ok, W.I.T.C.H stars 5 young heroines who are chosen to be the Guardians of the Veil.  They each discover they have unique powers that are related to the natural forces of the Earth.  With Will as their leader, the girls struggle to protect 2 worlds while dealing with the usual teenage drama.

This Set contains volume 1 of 5 for the series along with the slip case.  Volume 1 features the first 6 episodes.  The video & sound quality are superb and the Gallery is really unique and creative.  If you love W.I.T.C.H., then you have to pick this DVD up.  I hope Volume 2 gets released soon.",1163030400,,589,4.398148148148148
2561398,1,B000FDFOTE,"Don't buy this dvd, i waited 2 weeks for mine and it never came,finally i had to get a refund, and when i looked up lacewing media, all i got were hits for some type of insect,if you want w.i.t.c.h episodes so bad, then go to ___.witchmate.tripod.___, the quality isn't dvd quality but i got the entire first season and most of the second on my computer.",1161993600,,354,4.298507462686567
2561399,1,B000FDFOTE,"There is NO way that Disney would license this show to only ONE dealer in the entire country.  Disney is about volume and they would allow numerous stores to pick up the series on DVD to sell.  Also, this ""Lacewing Media"" doesn't even come up when looked up on the internet.  That makes me believe this is a bootleg compilation that is being sold to cash in on the series before it actually comes out on DVD.",1161648000,5,408,4.2727272727272725

8120996,1,B000FDFOTE,"This ""set"", one disk among several empty cases, is a poorly-produced black market ripoff evidently scan-converted from a Region 2 DVD released in Europe. Somebody spliced in the N. Am. theme songs; that's the only diff.

I've had it for a year or so, but already the DVD disk itself is starting to decompose, kicking out uncorrectable errors that cause blocky artifacts and playback freezes. What a nightmare!

Disney's idiotic handling of the entire W.I.T.C.H. line has been terminally frustrating for N. Am. fans, leaving only second-best and arguably illicit avenues for watching this cool series.",1224633600,2,600,5.239583333333333
8120997,5,B000FDFOTE,"W.I.T.C.H has a lot of qualities similar to Sailor Moon, Labyrinth and a hint of Captian Planet. I think it's a great show for kids. As far as children's shows go it's pretty good. It doesn't talk down to children and yet it has life lessons about team work and friendship without being obnoxiously preachy.

For a children's show the plots are surprisingly intricate and complex and the villains have enough depth and sympathy where you can understand their points of view. You have to watch it with an innocent mind, with the heart of a child. Yes, there are similar shows but when you're a child this sort of thing is still very new and very fun.

The main idea is there are five girls, each with power over a specific element. They are guardians, protectors of this world and a magical other world called Miridian, ruled by a wicked, immortal sorcerer named Phobos. The title is the initials of all the five heroes.

Of course good triumphs over evil and there are some fun and fantastic moments. It's perfect for all children and people of any age for that matter.",1193097600,6,1069,4.557291666666667
8120998,1,B000FDFOTE,"Unfortunately, the reviews on the show are focused more on the distributor ""Lacewing"" and not the actual show.  I got hooked on the show when my daughers found it on Jetix.  It's a show about 5 Teenage girls who come into ""powers"" over the elements and they have to protect the ""veil"" of other worlds.  Involving plots that carry on throughout the seasons.  (there are two.)  You can only find the series available on amazon.uk, where it is a big hit, but not so in the US. If you can find a DVD player that plays other regions, then try that avenue.

Disney has not chosen to renew the series for a third season (which is disappointing) but I wonder if its due to consumer response or the fact they wish to promote their ""Winx"" series more.

Check back often, maybe this product will be available again, but through a more reputable and ""authorized"" distributor.

Lacewing=bootleggers, simple.  If they feel that this claim is wrong, then have them contact Disney's legal department and clarify.",1166227200,9,996,4.67816091954023

8121000,5,B000FDFOTE,"I'm not sure why Amazon.com allows users to post who have clearly not bought the item.  How do I know this?  Easy! Because the last reviewer didn't even mention what is on this DVD!  Which is what most of us ""potential"" buyers want to know anyway.

All that aside, this DVD has the first 6 episodes.  Video quality?  Superb.  Audio?  Superb also.  If you're a fan of the series, I say pick this up.  This might be our best chance to have WITCH on DVD for quite some time.  Oh, and I only paid $12 for mine  = P",1165276800,4,510,4.040404040404041
8121001,1,B000FDFOTE,"This product is still a Boot-legged rip-off.  Before buying this DVD, ask yourself:

1) You only get the first 6 episodes on the 1 disc.  For $14 + S & H ($5?) x 5 discs (total discs they were telling us would eventually be available) = $100 for a bootlegged series.  Isn't that too expensive?

2) The show is owned by Disney.  Why is it being distributed only through Lacewing Media?

3) Who is Lacewing Media?

4) Why is there no web-site for this supposed ""studio"", Lacewing Media?

5) They were selling this as a boxed set, with only the first DVD, for $25 + S & H.  What happened to the box?

I'll tell you what happened.  They got so many bad reviews, they removed that offer and put up this new one, without the box.  Now all the old reviews are gone.",1165190400,6,758,4.180555555555555
