8566697,5,B00AANLQC8,"I love this movie.

Remember takes you on a journey after economic collapse, and what might happen when governments try to force stability on the people. It's a classic robin hood story set in a world of matrix-like red pills and a blue jell. Definitely a Christian film, the hero demonstrates true religion by helping children confiscated from their parents at birth--practical orphans--to rendezvous with their true parents and escape the country.

Some might find this film pretty depressing--especially the first half. The filmmaker's portrayal of a communist state is far from utopia, but reminiscent of what was actually seen in the USSR or Red China, albeit with a futuristic twist. However, the developing storyline, the snowy Canadian landscape and the CGI effects were enough to keep my rapt attention until about half way through the movie, when the action really picks up.

If you are a Science Fiction buff, you'll love Remember. And now, Christians can enjoy Sci-Fi without turning off their brains or having their consciences assailed. The worldview presented is solid, and may open your eyes to some new theological truth. For example, in an age of everything new, there is great value in Remembering. You have to Remember.
