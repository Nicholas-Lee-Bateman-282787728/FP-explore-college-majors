6094778,5,B00GOC750Q,"I have been a fan of this show since I was a kid.  The first season was very good, I hate when Farrah left after the first season, but when the introduce Cheryl Ladd to play her younger sister.  Then it didn't seem to bad and when Farrah came back in season 3 for 3 of the 6 esp. To complete part of the comment that she was to do seem cool to see all 4 angels together.  But once season 3 ended and they brought Shelly Hack in season 4 they just didn't give her the chance to show all of she could do with the role.  Then when the blame her for rating to go down they fired her.  Then we get season 5 with Tanya Roberts.  I feel once Kate Jackson left the show it really was the end of the show,however I watch the last two seasons,I hated the way they ended the series.  I would have rather they did some type of wrap up to end the show.  I have all 5 seasons of the show,I have the two movies of Charlie's Angels,I also have the reboot of Charlie's Angels. There will never be another show quite like it.  I hope anyone who buys it we love it like I do.  I do plan on buying this one because the first season before this was not very well package and see if this is better.",1386374400,,1176,3.8625

One thing I don't like is the method of storage, all discs staked on each other -  the good side it is not thick on the shelf. All in all a good purchase.",1463356800,2,287,3.864406779661017

6094839,5,B00GOC750Q,"Charlie's Angels Season One DVD reissued by Mill Creek Entertainment is a MUST-OWN!!! This version is so clear and plays beautifully even on a 50 inch tv screen you get to relive the Angels visually in their iconic glory - the hair, clothes and fashion. I have 2 copies of Season 1 - the other is actually unopened - of the first version with the blue cover, However, the clarity leaves much to be desired because the resolution becomes hazy when you see it on a 50 inch tv screen typical for 70s shows. This Mill Creek version takes the cake as the best version. Thank you to Mill Creek for giving this iconic series - at least the best season which is Season One - the great treatment it deserves. The price is also the best. Bravo!",1404518400,7,734,4.326086956521739
6094840,5,B00GOC750Q,"Loved this show as a 13 year old kid. The packaging is cool, all four DVD's stack on top of each other in a regular size DVD case. The picture at times is a little blurry or fuzzy but remember these shows are almost 40 years old. I enjoyed them really well. It was good clean fun to watch Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson), Jill Monroe (the Late Farrah Fawcett) & Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith), get the bad guys without barely getting a scratch or messing up their hair or clothes? I always thought the acting was good, the stories great. Plus I love seeing the 1970's furniture, houses, clothes & culture. All three ladies went on to better roles, Farrah doing several highly acclaimed Tv & film roles. Kate went on to do Films & ""Scarecrow & Mrs King"". Jaclyn became the queen of TV mini series, etc. Watching this makes me miss Farrah. A great, strong woman, who at the end of her life fought cancer with bravery & dignity. Rest In Peace, Farrah, Because now you are truly an Angel...",1403913600,,982,4.4010989010989015
6094841,5,B00GOC750Q,"Mill Creek has been re-releasing a bunch of out-of-print Sony titles on DVD lately, and since I already own the original pressings of most of these they hold no interest for me. The exception was this debut season of CHARLIE'S ANGELS. I never liked the way Sony presented their Angels releases in terms of cover art and packaging. Their 2003 release was needlessly bulky with each disc housed in its own plastic snapcase and could have been half the size. Sony also chose to capitalize on the 2000s CHARLIE'S ANGELS films using the font from the movies rather than the original Angels logo. Mill Creek rectifies the problems with slim casing (the discs are stacked on top of each other; no paper sleeves) and sharp-looking cover art featuring the iconic silhouette and Angels font. I got my set for under $10 so I couldn't resist owning a backup copy with such nice cover art.

The episodes themselves are unedited and look brighter and clearer than they ever did on TV, though they are not perfect. The original 90-minute pilot telefilm is included, and while it lays the groundwork, it's not as entertaining as the episodes that came after.

There was a magic chemistry among the three original Angels during this first season, and the show was an instant ratings hit. After 1976 turned into '77, it seemed Angel-Mania exploded and the ladies appeared on every magazine cover imaginable; the toy production was not far behind. Kate, Farrah and Jaclyn shine in every episode this season and some of my favorites include:

""Lady Killer"": My favorite of the season. A great script that sort of parodies Hugh Hefner and Playboy but with Hugh O'Brian as the publisher of ""Feline"" magazine. Jill goes undercover as a centerfold. The script has clever dialogue, great action sequences and a ""twist"" ending--all the marks of a great episode.

""The Seance"": Kelly goes undercover as an heiress and while under hypnosis is forced to revisit her unhappy childhood in an abusive orphanage. I love how Sabrina and Jill show genuine concern as Kelly spirals out of control.

""Dancing in the Dark"": Jill teaches disco, Kelly joins a blackmail ring, and Sabrina plays a nerdy victim while Dennis Cole plays the handsome villain.

""Angels at Sea"": Frank Gorshin plays a homicidal maniac who plants three bombs on a luxury liner. Another great team episode that ends with each of the Angels diffusing a bomb.

""Angels in Chains"": The prison episode with guest inmate Kim Basinger--'nuff said.

The first season found a more gritty feel to most of the episodes. It's too bad they lost some good writers like Barney Rozenzweig because from Season 2 onward, the show seemed ""cleaned up and dumbed-down"" a little for the younger viewers, when it moved to 9pm instead of 10.

Still, if you want to see why ""Charlie's Angels"" became an instant pop-culture phenomenon or you're a child of the '70s looking for a good retro buzz, this set will do the trick and you can't beat the price!",1396137600,15,2962,4.81496062992126

6094843,5,B00GOC750Q,"This is one of the best classic shows on television.( Police drama's that is)
There are a total of five seasons of Charlie's angels.
Mill creek has released season one on disc.
This is the second release of this series.
Charlie's angles was released earlier by another company, however the second season box was backward.
I decided to buy this series again by mill creek.
The series is also available in a box set,
CHARLIE'S ANGLELS THE COMPLETE SERIES.
The classic show was a success, and the new version of Charlie's angels was canceled after a short season.
Sometimes remakes fail.",1394323200,,584,4.792079207920792
