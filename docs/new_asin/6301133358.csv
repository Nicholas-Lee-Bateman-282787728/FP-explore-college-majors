Very well done & most enjoyable.  It once again shows not only the great voice of this man, but his great sense of humor and ability to enjoy all people. Great.....",1312070400,,305,4.410714285714286
7811165,2,6301133358,"I enjoyed this video the two times I've seen it but agree with Maltin that it is for Pavarotti fans and does lack depth as a documentary of western opera visiting the far east.  The Chinese students were really a delight and it was fun seeing someone from China speaking fluent Italian!  The occasion was taking Italian musicians/singers to perform La Boheme in China and Pavarotti singing in the Great Hall of the People in Bejing.  If you are a Pavarotti fan, you'll really enjoy this video.  Otherwise, it's probably a one time viewing for most people, even opera buffs.  Refreshing that Chinese people, in the city at least, are familiar with western opera and like it.  Seeing a short clip of Pavarotti perform in a Chinese opera was also a novelty.  He travels with quite an entourage!",998006400,2,791,4.688405797101449
7811166,4,6301133358,"This documentary of Pavarotti's trip to China is probably interesting if you're an uncritical fan of the man.  If you're more a fan of his singing,  I recommend the concert-only video of his recital in the Great Hall of the  People- what an amazing looking place it is, huge and very modern, but with  a gargantuan, unbelievably bourgeois central chandelier!  Pavarotti is a  less than interesting fellow in many ways, while he is without argument the  supreme tenor of the last 100 years, greater than Caruso.  There is a good  deal of superstar posturing, draping of large scarves over and around  himself, clowning around in his notably charming fashion.  It gets a little  wearisome.  Part of the Great Hall concert is included in this video, but  the impact of the concert-only VHS is so much greater.  Pavarotti is in  stupendous voice, inspired, even!  It is singing that blazes and makes the  world whole again!  Every offering is saturated with the genius of his  phenomenal communicative gifts, and matched by the voice at its ecstatic  best in every way!  Impossible to overstate the astonishing example of the  singing art given to the world by way of a clearly enraptured Chinese  audience.  The travel-docu part of the film is 2 stars and largely  forgettable, but the singing is way 5 stars.  That makes 4 stars in my  book!- the extra rating surely standing for immense gratitude at having  lived while this man was exercising his rare art!  Something indeed to be  grateful for.",967680000,4,1495,4.836653386454183
7811167,5,6301133358,"ALTHOUGH MORE A DOCU-DRAMA OF MAESTRO'S VISIT TO CHINA WITH THE GENOA OPERA COMPANY, I ATTRIBUTE THE MAJESTY OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE TO THEIR TRADITION AS MOST EUROPEANS DO. WHEN LUCIANO,SINGING THE ARIA 'CHE GELIDA  MANINA' FROM LA BOHEME HIT THE LONG HIGH C AND HELD SAME THE AUDIENCE WENT  WILD GIVING A LONG OVATION BEFORE THE ARIA EVEN ENDED.  LUCIANO BEING THE  FIRST WESTERNER TO PERFORM IN THE GREAT HALL, AND HE FELT RIGHT AT HOME.  THE POLITICIANS SHOULD TAKE HEED OF THIS. MUSIC TRANSFORM CULTURES.ALL THE  PERFORMANCES ARE 'PAR EXCELLENCE'. MAESTRO EVEN DONNED ORIENTAL GARB AND  PERFORMED AN ASIAN PIECE, AND WAS WELL RECEIVED. THE BEHIND THE SCENES AND  LOGISTICS FOR THE DURATION INCLUDING BRINGING FOOD, STOVES,REFRIGERATORS  WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS.  WHEN THE ASIAN CULTURE OBJECTED TO A PORTION OF A  SCENE OF LA BOHEME, A SIMPLE REWRITE SUFFICED. EVERY ONE SAVED FACE WITHOUT  A CULTURE CLASH. UPON DEPARTURE AND A DESIRE TO DONATE STOVES/REFRIGERATORS  ETC.; SEEING THIS WOULD BE A SLIGHT TO THE ASIAN PEOPLE, THE OFFER WAS  QUICKLY WITHDRAWN. THIS IS THE SIMPLE 'TRADIZIONE' WE ALL NEED TO RETURN  TO.  I ORIGINALLY VIEWED THIS VIDEO IN 1987(1986 VERSION) AND MOST  RECENTLY SEPT. '99.. I ENJOY THIS VIDEO, VIEW OFTEN AND SHOW TO  FRIENDS/FAMILY TO SEE IF THEY DISCERN THE UNDERLYING BENEFIT.  I GIVE  'DISTANT HARMONY' TEN STARS.",947635200,3,1348,4.986486486486487
7811168,5,6301133358,"I can't imagine why this wonderful production, which appeared in the Washington, D.C. area in 1986, briefly, has never been widely circulated. Pavarotti conducting Master Classes with translator, or without.  Definitely an insider's view for music pedagogues.  The highlight is when  LP steps over the threshold of a Chinese temple and breaks into  ""Nessun Dorma""!",940464000,,364,5.5636363636363635
