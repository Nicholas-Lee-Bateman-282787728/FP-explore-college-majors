8227811,5,B000XC12F2,I only gave this 5 stars cuz the original is amazing. This is hardley uncut. The only differences are showing something for less than a second longer. The uncut version is supposed to be the original NC-17 version but there really isn't much difference. plus... YOU CAN SEE ALL THE UNCUT FOOTAGE ON YOUTUBE!! just search scream uncut footage.

8227812,5,B000XC12F2,"There's no director's commentary on this DVD, but this is def. the version to get if you wanna see the movie in its uncut form!  Now, I don't know how hard it is, but if you want to see this movie (despite it being a R2 DVD), get a DVD rom drive that says ""Multi-Region.""  And when you put in the DVD, it plays like a normal DVD.  No codes, no anything.  The scenes SHOWN on the Director's Cut are as follows: Steve Orth's entrails falling out, a slower pan to Casey Becker's body hanging from the tree, Tatum's head ACTUALLY crushed by the garage door, after Kenny (the camerman) gets his throat slit you see more blood, and more of a graphic version of Stu and Billy stabbing each other, and you see that ""pool"" and ""dripping"" of blood when it cuts to Sidney's father.

If you see the normal version, that scene where it cuts to Sidney's father lying on the floor, you ""hear"" the blood splatting on the floor.  On the director's cut, there's a crapload of blood shown and dripping of blood ensues.  Lol.

5 stars for this DVD for actually being a Director's Cut and for this movie!  But oddly enough, the runtime on the Direcot's Cut says 107, whereas the run time for the normal DVD is 111.  Weird, but I don't know of any scenes that were cut out.",1225756800,5,1251,4.262711864406779
