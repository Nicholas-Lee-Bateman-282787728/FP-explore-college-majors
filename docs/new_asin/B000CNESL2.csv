2466343,5,B000CNESL2,"It's been three years since they first met at the end of

the first movie after saving each other's worlds.

I'm very glad to know that Jimmy,Timmy and the rest of

the crew were great. I just saw the sequel on nickelodeon

monday night and it did even way better just like the

first one did three years ago. I also saw the promo for

Jimmy Timmy 3:The Jerkinators during the broadcast.",1137456000,3,387,4.305555555555555

2466358,4,B000CNESL2,"This sequel special corrected a lot of things that bothered me the first time around.  While there are a few that were still around, this worked very well in the shadow of its predecessor.
  First off, we got recurring villains from both TV shows, Professor Finbar Calamitous and the Anti-Faries...too bad only one of them crossed over.  More unfortunately, none of Timmy's human friends seemed to make an appearance while Jimmy's entire gang crossed over.  True, Cosmo and Wanda crossed over to Jimmy's universe, but it still feels a bit uneven.  Best of all, Jimmy and Timmy worked together more here and Jorgen Von Strangle makes a notable appearance.
  Okay, I really liked Jorgen Von Strangle's new prison.  The villains' plans were all interesting and the final battle was something different.  I wonder though if Timmy was able to sell Jorgen on the cover that he, Cosmo, and Wanda were just computer programs.  Also, how'd they pull of the inter-dimensional dance?  Is there an exception for people from other universes learning about fairies and their magic without consequences?  Unfortunately, none of these questions will be answered.
  Overall, a solid second part to this cross-over series.  Enjoy.",1405209600,,1212,5.107142857142857
