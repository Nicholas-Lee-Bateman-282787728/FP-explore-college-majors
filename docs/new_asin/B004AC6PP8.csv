8419940,5,B004AC6PP8,"I have a regular practice, but can't always get to class. Most yoga DVDs don't inspire me to get on my mat. The Power Yoga LIVE DVD is not designed for beginners. It is an Ashtanga-Vinyasa inspired LIVE practice for those familiar with that style of sequencing.  The setting is exotic, possibly Bali and the camera angles that capture real people with real modifications brings an energy that motivates me, but keeps me practicing at a safe pace. If you have a regular yoga practice and like a sequence that develops core and upper body strength balanced with focus and flexibility then this DVD is an excellent addition to your library.",1391904000,2,637,4.738738738738738
8419941,1,B004AC6PP8,"This workout is filmed around a small outdoor pool with approximately three dozen people posed around it.  If you are looking for a workout that shows you the poses, this is not for you.  The producers spend all your time panning around the three dozen or so amateurs positioned around the pool and not on the instructor.  When the instructor is shown there are so many people between you and the instructor that you can not see the entire pose.  If you are new to yoga, you will not see the correct positions.  In all a very low quality workout.  There are a lot better out there.  I was so disappointed that I am returning the other two workout DVDs of hers.",1370044800,2,660,4.360655737704918
8419942,5,B004AC6PP8,"This one of the three videos Stacy is a bit more fast paced....there is a lot of sun salutations, so i usually do this one if I feel good. When i'm sore throught the shoulders, i can't seem to keep up with the upward dog to downward dog flow. But i still do it cuz it IS a great workout. The class setting is kinda cool, you get to see how some people modify. But most of them are pretty good.",1305590400,2,393,3.8641975308641974
8419943,5,B004AC6PP8,"I am a big fan of Stacy McCarthy's videos.  I have the Power Yoga as well as the Lean and Defined one.  Both have similar poses, but this one has more difficult poses included.  I love how Stacy doesn't over ""Yogi"" her instruction.  Once you go through the DVD once, you'll be good to go (if you are familiar with yoga poses already).  This video doesn't get me sweating, but I do feel amazing afterwards and definitely feel my muscles got a bit of a workout (and one that is very different from my other regular workouts (circuit training and running).  I throw this video into my ""every other day"" rotation between harder cardio workouts and it makes a perfect balance.  I've done many yoga videos, and besides the people at YogaWorks, she's right up there in practical, easy-to-follow, can listen to every day, yoga instructors.  Some people have complained about the background noise in this video.  It advertises as being a ""live"" class.  So no surprise there is background noise.  If you focus on the practice, you barely notice after the first time.",1300492800,2,1056,4.684782608695652
