Not only was it well researched with great information, it is an awesome film visually and artistically. It displays a lot of creativity and soul which many films today are lacking. Scifi, horror, creepy reenactments, haunting score, beautiful cinematography, in- depth interviews and information... This movie is top notch and has all the right elements.

This is BY FAR the best information out there on the Montauk Project. You can tell the interviewer was good, because the subjects were more open and relaxed than in other videos. The director did a great job of presenting the information in a very objective, unbiased manner, in a way that can reach both those who have studied this conspiracy and those who are new to it.

This is the first time someone actually did some investigating and did justice to these men and their stories. I appreciate the approach that was taken in this movie - it was kept tangible and understandable. He kept it focused on the aspects of the project that are very believable, such as the mind-control aspect, which if you've done any research you know our government participates in (i.e. MK Ultra). The director did an incredible job with this, especially for a subject that is extremely obscure and with very little to go on!

I have yet to see a silly YouTube video that can hold any ground. The YouTube videos everyone keeps talking about mostly consist of poorly conducted interviews, or people who had nothing to do with the alleged project repeating information they have heard from said interviews.

The movie was beautifully executed. It's what a movie should be - ENTERTAINING! If he wanted to, he could have slapped together a load of YouTube videos and made a piece of garbage to appeal to the conspiracy junkies who think they know what happened as if they were there. This movie is a true piece of artwork and I enjoyed it.

Unfortunately, negative people are more vocal than positive people when it comes to reviewing things. Give this movie a shot - You won't be disappointed. Excellent job. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next.",1439251200,10,2180,4.818181818181818

6290793,5,B00ISFJY7Y,Exquisite! Award winning quality!,1427932800,4,33,7.5
6290794,4,B00ISFJY7Y,"The production is top notch.  The was it is told is great, except A little too much time spent on Stewarts back story.  There could have been more time spent on the technology in its place.  Would I recommend it?  Highly.  I do wish there was more time with the technology and how it was used.  But I hear more plans are in the works...

By the way; this is considered, and suggested to be a way for you to start your own research.  Even Stewart Swerdlow tells in the movie, ""...  Do your own Research.""  It is meant to be the start of an adventure.  In fact, I think I heard that the title of the opening credits song is: ""Begin your Adventure""; or something like that.

The books from Preston B. Nichols go great with it.  It adds much to it.

Update:  PS4 had an update; my PS4 now plays the blu-ray.

Take the time, and listen to what they are saying.  Then listen to Chris Garatano on the Montauk Chronicles Facebook pages.",1395878400,7,928,4.211428571428572
8645029,5,B00ISFJY7Y,This movie contains very interesting information about The Montauk Project.,1522800000,,75,6.6
8645030,1,B00ISFJY7Y,Unable to finish watching even though very interested due to the seriously toxic and hideous sound effects/music which would be suitable for torture. Volume of said noise too loud. Would have been OK without any sick sound. Painful to listen to.,1500854400,,245,5.0
8645031,2,B00ISFJY7Y,I wanted to know more about Montauk children and the whole story.  I could not follow this.  I'm not sure really what happened.  I think I would have liked just a plain documentary rather than this stylized version.,1492992000,,215,4.605263157894737
8645032,2,B00ISFJY7Y,Just terrible!!!,1478649600,,16,7.5
8645033,2,B00ISFJY7Y,A very well documentary. However the sound quality was really bad and you could barely understand what they were saying in this movie.,1461801600,,134,4.869565217391305

Bought it new too....",1447459200,,31,4.333333333333333
8645035,5,B00ISFJY7Y,WOW!  Totally worth the money! The story of the Montauk Project is so complex I had my doubts that it could be put into a film but they did it!,1443052800,4,143,3.7666666666666666
8645036,4,B00ISFJY7Y,"I liked the Movie, Loud soundtrack  distracts from the plot, but still thought provoking ...",1442707200,,92,5.133333333333334
8645037,1,B00ISFJY7Y,"Don't let these other reviews fool you. The movie was a jumbled combination of the same old stuff.
It was horribly disjointed. The sound quality was dismal. The graphics used for filler were juvenile at best.
I felt violated having paid for the video. I sent it back to White Phosphorus but they did not respond.
Don't waste your money.",1441843200,7,336,4.616666666666666
