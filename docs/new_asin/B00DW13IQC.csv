5859857,5,B00DW13IQC,"I loved this movie!!!  Very captivating, well written, very good performances from the actors.  The cinematography was excellent and I love the creative editing.  The film is fast paced and pulls you in right away and never lets you go.  You'll remember this movie for a long, long time.  I particularly loved the performances of Bill Johnson, Brittney Saylor, PJ Woodside, Mike Coon, Felicia Stewart, and that one sleepwalker with the long blond hair that shows up every so often.",1374710400,5,481,4.9625
5859858,4,B00DW13IQC,"A superb psychological thriller, told in a unique, uncompromising way. Unlike most of the thrillers you get at your local cineplex,  LUCID does not give itself away in the first ten minutes. Where it starts does not give away where it's going or where it will end. Along the way there are moments of film making brilliance.

5859870,2,B00DW13IQC,"I cannot say i hated it, because i didn't hate it. I didn't like a few choices made, and i didn't enjoy having to constantly adjust the volume on my tv set. Technical problem:(i have a nice sound bar and it works great on regular movies and shows on amazon, but when it comes to indie films it's a bit of a toss up, this one was all over the place, so keep your remotes handy!)

The story is about a woman named Monica, and she has a lot of trouble sleeping, has a boyfriend that recently moved in, and is suddenly getting worse and worse nightmares. She sees a therapist who tries to help her, and through the help of her friends she discovers a sleep doctor known as the sandman.

The plot was a bit better than what i've seen from this film company, so that was refreshing, the actors all seemed like they wanted to be there and like they enjoyed making this movie, but the script fell flat a lot. I liked the premise, like it's a smart idea to make a horror/thriller movie about lucid dreams, because that subject matter is scary on it's own. This movie wasn't scary, i did feel bad for the main character in this because her childhood was rough. I liked how they tried to convey dreaming and dream states without fake fog and things, so that's another good thing. But once again it all comes down to the bones of the movie, which is the writing. It was okay, there was some dialogue that ran on way too long, and other scenes that were cut too short. Sometimes i think it's helpful with indie movies to just comb through it a few times, i rewound here and there to make sure i fully understood the material, but some stuff just irked me. Like the underutilized Bill Johnson, if you are going to have him in a movie, please give him some more dialogue! he can most certainly act!
I cannot recommend this under the guise of an excellent movie, and i am very sorry to all who made this, because i know how much you all care deeply about what you make, and it shows, it does!  I think the most i can do is write about it, which is a good thing, at least i took the time to explain all that i liked and disliked. I can recommend this to people that like movies about dreams, that verge on the bit of horror.",1456876800,,2207,4.176056338028169

5859874,5,B00DW13IQC,"Lucid continues BBP Productions cerebral, well crafted, and nuanced experiments in horror. I was impressed with how seamlessly dream sequences were stitched together and juxtaposed with reality, especially toward the end, and I was pleasantly surprised by the scripts complexity and depth. P.J. not only explores themes of trauma, sexuality, love, andindeedfamily, but she also offers sophisticated meditations on (Freudian) psychoanalysis and subtle nods to certain strands of feminism. I also enjoyed P.J.s clever humor and BBP citations. I, for one, would like to know if Spirit Stalkers was a dream. I totally caught Aaron Frasier (Timmy) recounting dreams about his girlfriends mother killing her in the Sandmans waiting room! With all that said, P.J., BBP, and the rest of the production team are indebted to the films exemplary cast. Yes, some of the actors could benefit from more experience and training, as can most who are just starting their careers, but many offer engaging, believable performances that form the kernel of this indie gem. Brittney Saylor delivers a well balanced performance rife with the emotional intensity youd expect from someone grappling with the effects of her trauma and anger; Michael Coon fits the bill for a cute, endearing boyfriend who quickly garners audiences support with his skillful execution of heart and soul; and (spoiler alert) P.J. is so believable that shell make you cheer when Monica finally pulls the trigger!

5859884,5,B00DW13IQC,"I absolutely loved this movie.

This movie is horror and drama and suspense, with a little bit of romance and heartbreak.

It starts out with a woman, Monica, who is having horrible nightmares.
I have horrible nightmares myself, so I immediately could relate to this character, especially when she said that her nightmares had become so bad that she was afraid to go to sleep every night.

Monica tries everything to deal with her nightmares and to get rid of them, but they keep getting worse, to the point that she begins sleepwalking and cannot tell what is real and what is a dream.  This was the part of the movie that I enjoyed the most, with broken scenes that moved so quickly that I didn't want to blink because I might have missed something.  I did rewind several times because I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss anything. Scenes of Monica's childhood, and her recent past, and the present, all jumble together with her memories and her dreams and her fears, along with the manipulations of her psychologist and sleep therapist.

The movie keeps moving faster as it comes to an amazing ending.

I loved the actors, especially because they were ordinary looking people whom I could identify with.
I especially loved the character of Monica, and the actress who played her was amazing.

I would love to see a sequel of this movie.",1442275200,2,1344,4.641350210970464

5859897,3,B00DW13IQC,"Low budget psycho thriller with a decent storyline.  The acting is unnatural and stiff. Most of the actors also acted in other capacities, e.g. script writing and technical staging.  PJ Woodside's multiple functions (producer, writer, actor) in this movie are commendable but there are obvious reasons why these are usually done by separate people.

The topic, lucid dreaming, is well chosen and quite interesting.  The dream scenes are very artistic and scary.  The viewer's confusion in the beginning to distinguish what is real and what is the dream is the most positive aspect of this movie.  The flashbacks are helpful tools that let the viewer figure out what has happened in Monica's past and give glimpses into her abusive childhood.  Unfortunately, there are plenty of lose ends and the end is somewhat vague.  The musical score is good and fits the overall spooky theme.  The sound was inconsistent, sometimes very loud (scream scenes especially!), often low and muffled (dialog).  For my personal taste too much violence, blood, and gore.  Good psychological thrillers can live without all that.

Summary: it is a decent movie for a ""home"" production.  As a commercial film, it has plenty of room for improvement, namely better acting and a more fully developed storyline.",1438300800,9,1283,5.140096618357488
5859898,3,B00DW13IQC,"This movie could have been better if the writer would have left out the whole ""My Dad is a Pedophile and the weirdo in the basement rapist"" scene. I just don't like to see anything like that in movies even in high budget movies like Pulp Fiction (the man rapist scene). Other then that, I did like the plot of the movie because I always have Lucid dreams and it would be cool if we could be in each other's dreams and control them(for good that is).",1437696000,3,449,4.172413793103448

I stuck with it simply because I really wanted to like it, but there was just NO WAY that was going to happen.  If I could read this as a book or watch it with different actors, I think it would be a much more pleasurable experience.

Please note that I am in no way an acting critic.  There are many actors that I admire for a variety of reasons; some are main stream popular actors and some are cheesy B-movie ""over the top"" actors.  I enjoy a range of entertainment, but this made me sad.  Again, the story was interesting and had loads of potential, but the acting killed it.",1437696000,,701,4.305343511450381

If the only cinema you believe is worth your attention cost at least 10 million dollars to produce, and if the only actors you believe should be on screen have year round personal trainers, dieticians, surgeons, whatever, then just avoid this film. This is a microbudget film, courtesy of Kentucky. The woman who starred as the psycho therapist in LUCID, was also the film's writer, director, producer, sound and picture editor, and special effects makeup artist.  BJ succeeds at this for the most part. For one person to pull that much off, on a small budget, without coming across amateurish, or smacking of regional theater, is an admirable achievement. Actually, I'd rather watch a movie like this any day, than watch some of the dreck that Hollywood coughs up. (read: NOAH.)

The basic story revolves around Monica, a young woman who has bizarre recurring night terrors, which she acts out. She worries that she might do harm to her new boyfriend, who just moved in. Due to issues in her past, Monica goes to see a psychologist. And is that psychologist ever a b! tch. Since her night terrors are becoming more severe, on the advice of her two best friends, she resorts to a famous sleep therapist for help.  At a self help seminar by this sleep therapist, Monica discovers that she can control her night terrors via lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming occurs when the dreamer is able to know they are asleep in their dreams, and control their content to a certain extent. What Monica does not realize, is the secret connection between her psychologist and the sleep therapist. Nor does Monica realize, at least consciously, how evil her psychologist actually is. Sad, when you realize that Monica has severe child abuse and incest issues, and a deadly accident in her past to work thru.  Not to mention the mess she gets herself into, from trusting the b! tch of a psychologist.

The idea for the film is pretty good, and the script worked fine to bring the concept across. Since a lot of the film, especially towards the end, exists within Monica's dream state, some of that portion of the film can get a bit repetitive. (""Do it Monica! Do it Monica!"" gets repeated quite often at that point.) The actress who portrayed Monica brought across the intensity of the horror she experienced, and was quite believable. At first, I had to adjust a bit to the quality of the picture. I didn't have an opportunity to get offended by any lack in production values,  since I was so engaged by the plot and characters.  I was entertained by the movie, with the ""dream within a dream within a dream"" mind games, and plot twists.  Since this film never played at the local cinemaplex, it isn't rated, altho its probably around a PG-13 rating due to clothed sex scenes, child incest topics, and violence.  Incidentally, I checked out their production company online.  If you enjoy B horror films, this cinematic repertoire company filmed other titles. I saw the trailer for a vampire film, THE CARETAKERS, which looks like it'd be fun to watch, also by Big Biting Pig Productions .",1429747200,6,3107,4.74582560296846

5859948,1,B00DW13IQC,"I'll preface this with the understanding that this is a very low budget pet project by the writer/director/co-star, but I'm still going to review it based on its merits as a motion picture that I paid money to watch.

First off, the script is interesting, and with some refinement could have bordered on great. That's about as good as it gets, though. The acting, with one or two exceptions, is terrible. It plays out like the scenes between the action in adult films. The cinematography is also awful and draws the same similarities. By far, though, the most frustrating thing about this movie is the terrible, terrible directing. Every shot is framed so close to the speaking actor's face that it feels like you're watching a 90 minute Barbara Walters interview. This constant, extreme close up on everything just makes you realize even more how terrible the acting is. At one point I felt like the movie was invading my personal space, it was that uncomfortable to watch.

Also, this movie has the most pointless, stupid assault scene in the history of movies, so if you're into that kind of thing, it's got that going for it.",1426291200,3,1129,4.725888324873097

5859975,5,B00DW13IQC,"I consider myself a connoisseur of low budget horror films. A foodie, but for movies. And also food. But for the purposes of this review, let's leave my dining habits out of it.

As I have stated, I am a movie foodie, and I found Lucid to be a delicious combination plate of high concept brain food and low budget Velveeta. Following in the footsteps of Vanilla Sky, the Matrix, and Dallas, director PJ Woodside explores the sometimes blurry line between dream and reality. Raising profound questions, this film has the deep richness of a good Chianti at Charles Shaw prices.

While some of the acting lends the shot-on-location thriller the scent of fried chicken and biscuits, the plot is thick and juicy and the dream sequences sweeter than watermelon wine. Woodside's choice to write strong female leads and supporting roles is a welcome change from the sausage fests that constitute most mainstream movies. With the genuinely disturbing Bill Johnson and Steve Hudgins, interesting and engaging themes, and excellent editing, Lucid is like duck confit: you'll need to savor it a couple of times before you start to really ""get it.""",1424476800,5,1135,4.93717277486911
5859976,5,B00DW13IQC,"This is a visceral movie. I think there are maybe some casually-stated social themes being explored. There's a survivor of sexual abuse (rape as a child by a male authority figure), undertones of lesbianism, and mental illness-- heavy, but not heavy-handed. The best friend/best friend's husband team seems extra heteronormative, but maybe that's realistic. It probably is realistic for much of Madisonville. Anyway, I thought of it as a surprisingly feminist thriller capable of touching on sensitive parts of some people. Having seen many or all of the other Big Biting Pig movies, I can honestly say that this movie seems more meaningful.

Like eating watermelon, the movie is juicy, alarming, and over too soon.",1424476800,5,715,5.217391304347826
5859977,3,B00DW13IQC,"A well made independent dream thriller. The story of a young woman having disturbing dreams that are starting to make her wonder if she is really dreaming or if there is something or someone controlling her mind.

An added bonus is Bill 'Leatherface 2' Johnson as Paw Paw; the creepy grandfather to the main character. After watching the film, be sure to check out the blooper reel. It is a fun treat and will provide plenty of laughs.",1424390400,3,609,4.809523809523809

5859979,2,B00DW13IQC,"The latest from the people down at Big Biting Pig Productions. This time its Pj Woodside's turn at the helm and her previous two films were some of the best ones produced from the Pig (Widow and The Creepy Doll). This film however is a small step down in quality from those two.

It is more of a personal film for Pj dealing with dreams/nightmares and their sometimes destructive nature. I'm sure some of the many dream sequences littered throughout the film spawned from Pj's own subconscious and instances of troubled sleep in her past. Usually with such low budget filmmaking, in fact micro budget, the film's story has to be pretty inventive and well written. This is usually the case for Big Biting Pig films and even here the plot was very intriguing and even provided a company trademark twist or two. Still I think Lucid is a step down for writing from Pj with a few obvious and damaging flaws mainly from its dialogue.

It begins rather horridly, with a completely forced and unrealistic conversation between two couples and a bottle of wine. As things progress in the story the writing itself tends to get better but not without some more odd moments along the way. To try not to spoil things, I will just say the inclusion of the ex-boyfriend in the story was done all wrong as he was thrust upon the viewers out of nowhere. Of course this makes more sense later on in the film (as much as it feels odd and out of place in the beginning), the same thing with a specific therapist session, so I cannot be too critical of this.

Acting has sometimes been a issue with the Big Biting Pig films, being of such small hometown production value, their actors are usually just amateur locals. Lucid being the first case of utilizing a professional actor with Bill ""Leatherface"" Johnson of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 fame. They usually have a few actors who always put on a good performance (Pj Woodside herself, Steve Hudgins, Scott Cummings, Kristine Renee Farley, and my good friend Nick Faust). But most of these names are missing from this film because instead of providing the usual faces, I'm sure they want to get a variety going with new talent which is a admirable and intelligent thing to do. However in this particular case it hinders more then it does any good in the result.

Pj Woodside knows how to direct dream sequences though. This film is so full of them as expected that its tone becomes extremely surrealistic. Overall it is still a fun and entertaining film like all that come out of the world of the Pig but usually from Pj as the director I tend to expect something more deep and psychologically rooted as her previous films. This one attempted to achieve that but did not succeed on the same level as her past experiences.",1424390400,,2749,4.58130081300813

Being a fan of psychological thrillers that take you for a wild ride, like Jacob's Ladder and The Machinist,this was right up my alley. I'm also a fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2, so it was fun seeing Bill Johnson of Leatherface fame, in the movie as  well.",1424390400,3,553,4.359223300970874

5860018,2,B00DW13IQC,"I swear all of the other ratings must have been from those associated with the movie.  This is definitely a B-quality movie. I wanted to like the movie but didn't.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star, was I gave it an A for effort.  If this had been done in Hollywood, and had a bigger budget the sound quality and directing might have been better.

I hate it that they call movies with lousy acting horror/thrillers.  The only anxiety that came from this movie was the sense of urgency that it needed to end..",1424044800,2,515,4.268041237113402
5860019,5,B00DW13IQC,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Great acting, direction, and cinematography.  It's a pleasure to watch.  If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor.  Make sure you have popcorn handy.  It gives you something to do with your shaky hands.  I've watched this movie several times and I have never tired of it.",1424044800,7,312,4.685185185185185

5860022,5,B00DW13IQC,Rarely do you find an indie horror movie that is well written and finely acted with surprising twists along the way. Lucid provides one of those rare moments.

5860024,4,B00DW13IQC,"I am not a horror movie buff. I almost never watch big budget horror films that come out of Hollywood, because the formula they use is getting old. I consistently support Big Biting Pig films, because they are unique, not just in the genre of horror films, but unique compared to previous films by PJ Woodside and Steve Hudgins.",1423958400,3,328,4.576271186440678

5860028,5,B00DW13IQC,"I went into this movie not expecting much. Boy, was I surprised! Captivating from start to finish.
It's smartly written and finely acted. It's one of those movies that you'll want to watch more than once to catch every little detail. I'm excited to see a low-budget indie company making intelligent films. And I'm doubly excited that this was written and directed by a woman with strong female characters! I'm just discovering this indie production company and I can't wait to watch the rest of their films!",1414886400,5,507,4.839080459770115
5860029,5,B00DW13IQC,This did not hit me as the run-of-the-mill low budget horror. The story was not predictable and the scary quality was high!,1396656000,3,123,4.636363636363637
5860030,3,B00DW13IQC,"This movie is not for everyone. It's a little low budget horror film that was made here in my town. I even have a little cameo in it. I'm in the auditorium scene with my friend when the Sandman is giving his speech. I had fun filming it. Filming lasted about 4 or 5 hours that night. Bill Johnson is in this film, too. He played Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, so I'm in a movie with Leatherface! How awesome am I?

Anyway, this movie is crazy weird! Filled with off-the-wall dream sequences. It might take you a 2nd viewing to help you understand everything. A woman named Monica keeps having terrible bizarre dreams about killing her boyfriend, so she goes to a sleep therapist to try and help her. If you like weird low budget films, you might enjoy LUCID!!!",1390089600,4,772,4.436619718309859
5860031,5,B00DW13IQC,"As one other reviewer posted, Lucid does not give itself away in the first five minutes of watching. This is NOT your average independent film. It is beautifully shot, well written, and the cast has excellent chemistry. Lucid is fast paced, makes your skin crawl, and your hair stand on end. If you like psychological horrors, this is a movie for you.",1375488000,4,351,4.67741935483871
8598456,4,B00DW13IQC,"Lucid is a Great little film, Done by the same people that brought you FRANCES STEIN,  I really enjoyed this film, my wife and I felt really bad for the young girl with dream, sleep deprivation. Then to find out the main reason why was a real twist. The idea of having a ""Co Dream Therapist"" was something new and conjured up by Dr. Arron Nights wife Faith, which brings into the story even more problems.  Very well made with a good little cast, good acting, and a really good story.",1508284800,,484,4.3076923076923075

Quentin Tarantino.

What do they all have in common? They're all some of the most brilliant movie directors of our generation.

I'm going to be honest, P.J. Woodside is one of the greatest director/writer/actresses of all time. Period.

But this movie...will NEVER...and I mean NEVER...be Creepy Doll.",1471046400,,389,5.701754385964913
