1810234,3,B00007GZYA,I had seen Ellis Island on PBS and I didn't realize this wasn't the one. I like the PBS better,1361232000,,94,3.75
1810235,5,B00007GZYA,"This is a fabulous documentry on Ellis Island.  This shows how our ancestors came to this country and what they went throught at Ellis Island.  (Nothing like today with no borders guarded and illegials crossing our borders every day).  This is a must see video for every American.  It makes you proud of your ancestors and every ""LEGAL"" immigrant who came to this great country in hopes of the American Dream.",1337558400,3,409,4.71830985915493
1810236,5,B00007GZYA,"I purchased this video to use in my third grade classroom to supplement our immigration unit of study.  It was viewed after my teaching of the unit was fairly well done. It is an excellent resource and even though at times I needed to pause and reexplain a point, the children were mesmerized and loved it.  They asked to see it again. It made the unit real to them especially with so many wonderful photos, film and interviews.  There was only once where the word ""hell"" was used otherwise nothing offensive.  I highly recommend it.",1328140800,5,533,4.578947368421052
1810237,5,B00007GZYA,"As someone who worked on Ellis Island in New York's harbor, I can readily attest to the fact that this is an outstanding documentary about ""The Island of Hope, The Island of Tears."" Mandy Patinkin hosts this three part film that showcases not just the history of Ellis Island and how America processed immigrants before it was built but also tells the very human story of how people from all over the world came to Ellis Island hoping desperately for a better life as American citizens.

There is the story of Castle Garden which was built to process immigrants before Ellis Island; and we see how the first buildings on Ellis Island were ruined by fire only a few short years after they opened. There is the story of how a half a million dollars was spent on a new set of buildings constructed of fireproof materials; and the footage of joyous newcomers sailing into the harbor as they first laid eyes on America with its Statue of Liberty is impressive and moving at once.

There are many, many stories of how people were processed over the years until the facility was closed in late 1954; some of the tales are thrilling but others quite heartbreaking. For example, families could be separated if one or two members were rejected because it was thought they might be too ill to enter--thus, some members of the family could enter and others were forced to return home, perhaps never to see their loved ones again. Still others committed suicide by jumping into the water rather than return to a life of misery in their native countries.

Yet for all the incredibly sad tales, we see just how hard the staff worked on Ellis Island to process and accept as many immigrants as possible. Kitchen employees cooked ethnic meals; and social workers and interpreters worked with immigrants to help them. Actually, there is so much more as to exactly how they processed immigrants over the decades--but I'll leave the rest for you to discover as you watch the film!

I highly recommend this documentary for anyone studying immigration and its history. True, there were other ports through which people entered America; but New York's Ellis Island was by far the largest port for people entering a new country. This is educational and poignant indeed!",1308268800,8,2245,4.748717948717949
1810238,5,B00007GZYA,"My grandfather was an immigrant from Germany as was my grandmother and her family.
This movie tells their story.
The requirements to be accepted in America were not easy.
If you failed,THEY SENT YOU BACK . HOW DEVASTING CAN THAT BE TO A FAMILY.
I was very humbled to watch the courage and price they paid to be Americans.
A must-see for every American.",1299110400,6,352,4.515625
1810239,5,B00007GZYA,So far I have only seen the first hour.  Used this to show to my genealogy class to give some idea of what it was like for their ancestors.  This is worth viewing and keeping in your home.,1256515200,2,188,3.9210526315789473

1810241,2,B00007GZYA,"An adult might like it, but you can get the same info reading online articles about emigrees and Ellis Island.

It jumps around from person to person, and shows the Ellis Island building about 100 times.

It is not entertaining for middle school or high school students at all.  It has a lulling to sleep quality.

It repeats info too much, and is too slow in moving forward.",1163462400,7,375,4.470588235294118
1810242,5,B00007GZYA,"""My father hugged my mother and told her, 'you don't need to be afraid ever again.  We're in America now.'""
That was one of the MANY personal narratives included in this FANTASTIC documentary that brought tears to my eyes.  The stories of how immigrants reacted when they first came to this country and saw ""Lady Liberty"" is very well told and will leave you with a new appreciation of the great blessing of being born in this free and prosperous land.
I've watched this four-volume documentary two times and will probably watch it a third time.  The stories are all so inspiring and so amazing and so emotional!  Prior to viewing this, I did not have an understanding of what price our grandparents and great grandparents paid to get to this country.
I can't recommend this video highly enough.  My daughter watched it in school and she loved it, too.
Of all the documentaries I've watched, I'd give this a 5 stars PLUS.  I'd say it's one of the best I've ever seen.  It will leave you changed.  I can't even look at a flag now, without thinking about those precious, faith-filled immigrants and getting a tear in my eye.  ""Ellis Island"" is *that* kind of video.",1002240000,51,1163,4.579710144927536

1810248,5,B00007GZYA,"this is an excellent story of immigrants coming to this country through Ellis Island.  It gives a realistic feeling of what it must have like to sit in the big waiting room, go through the medical exam, present immigration papers and fear rejection.  Actual photos are  used.  I used it every year in my American History classes as we studied that period.  It was so effective!  Adults as well as students  will enjoy this film and learn a great deal also.  I like it so much - - that is why I am buying the DVD now that the VCR tapes  are not used anymore.",1402185600,2,557,4.228571428571429
1810249,5,B00007GZYA,It was very emotional and proved how important it is to this country to welcome immigrants.  There are hardly any americans that can't trace their heritage through Ellis Island.,1398643200,2,177,5.103448275862069
1810250,4,B00007GZYA,"PLOT: Stolen loot from a bank heist has everyone chasing everyone.

1926~ A bank heist has half the money missing and 10 years later the ROBBER is out of jail and soon to be ""deported"" on Ellis Island and 2 Security Agents get drug into the money search. When gangsters follow the trail every one is following everyone. This is above average movie. Donald Cook is trying to romance Peggy Shannon who is the niece to the ""ROBBER"" and added fun is always whiney Johnny Arthur. This builds as they ended up at a creepy cemetery and excellent for this time in a swamp car chase. I give this 4 STARS for very good plot and even better film catching lots of action. also UNCREDITED was Carl ""Alalfa"" Switzer as Manuel...you will totally not recognize.",1394323200,,745,4.518518518518518
1810251,5,B00007GZYA,"I am not a fan of Mandy Patinkin, but I have to admit that he does a wonderful job with this.

My grandfather emigrated to this country around the turn of the century, This is so well done that I can almost put myself in his place and imagine what he must have experienced both on the way over here and once he reached Ellis Island.

It's so very well done, and the old photographs are priceless in conveying the experiences of the immigrants.  It's a very emotional journey; if you had family members come through Ellis Island this is definitely a must see!",1378512000,5,558,4.346153846153846

7976500,5,B00007GZYA,"Ellis Island. From the early 1890s to 1954, this place of buildings served as the main entry point to the mainland, The USA. Many, many immigrants arriving from mostly European Countries and for many reasons for coming, found themselves excited, nervous, and afraid.
They came in ships, all classes of people, some more wealthy than others. The really poor found themselves in what was known as 3rd class, ""steerage"". They slept in their clothes all over. Relatives with numbers of family members slept together and ate together for days during the voyage. They all complained, but they all knew the end of the trip would soon be the most worthwhile, ever.
They all fled poor conditions in their respective Countries, poverty, famine, or plain just couldn't get a good life going.
Once coming into view of the Statue of Liberty, some found themselves on their knees and crying just for seeing it in their sights.
They had to have known in their hearts that a better life was ahead for them and their children.
Once on the island, they had to be ""processed"" or in today's terms ""vetted"". They ALL had to be EXAMINED thoroughly for disease and possibly not being able to even hold a job once in the Country. If the ""agents"" examining such immigrants found anything deemed ""problematic"", they would be marked on the shoulder with some chalk on the clothing. Codes were used to indicate various things to be re-examined further.
Some would be immigrants would be turned away and NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER, but taking into consideration family matters, kids, etc. The ""examining agents"" did not want to split up a family if the parent was allowed to pass and the children could not pass for a disease, etc.
The whole family would be prevented from entry.

Survivors of the Ellis Island entry talk in length of their personal experiences and how their parent or parents got through the whole process.
Using stills and some footage together, a well documented journey was presented here. I highly recommend this to EVERYONE! Especially now, with Countries that are deemed not friendly to the USA being ""extremely vetted"" for entry. We cannot and will not allow US to be another Germany or Europe full of other's ""dredge"" with radical ideology and hatred for America. We will stand firm and only allow those who in their hearts and minds want to truly integrate into American Society and want to be a productive member.",1485993600,2,2406,4.811594202898551
