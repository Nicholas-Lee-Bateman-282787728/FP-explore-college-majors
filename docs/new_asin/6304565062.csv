903684,4,6304565062,"Filmed back-to-back with the bracing PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES, this is the more delirious and sexual of Gilling's Cornish duo. As the estimable David Pirie has pointed out in his essential A HERITAGE OF HORROR, THE REPTILE works on a more imagistic level. Although, I would add that it does seem on this recent reviewing to be as thematically layered as its companion. The brief, atmospheric and suspensful precredit sequence sets up a sort of paradigm which will structure the rest of the film. A high-angle view of the desolate landscape of Cornwall, in the immediate foreground the stark branches of a tree reach down into the frame like threatening tentacles of some offscreen menace. A beckoning sounds of a flute playing a vaguely Asian enchantment wafts through the evening. We pan from left to right and pick up on a man walking toward an imposing manor house, the windows are lit up and the man continues in. As he wanders upstairs we are led to expect a sort of Romantic assignation as our well appointed invader is obviously in the mood. Suddenly, a shout, our intruder turns toward an older man behind him. A door opens and he starts to turn again as a green skinned thing in a slinky wrap is upon him striking into his throat with its long fangs. It withdraws into the room (tilted angle) the door closing it in as our man now staggers out of the house, face blackened and mouth foaming, finally dropping onto a tomb in the family graveyard. High angle of his body draped on the cross. Roll credits. It's a masterful opening. Hammer was usually adept at grabbers and this is one of the very best. The judicious camera set-ups, use of sound to establish suspense, tight editing, and paucity of dialogue all combine to create an admirably filmic overture.  Both of the Cornish films deal with an alien plague devastating an isolated are in Britian. The use of the same sets from PLAGUE, and sometimes the same set-ups on those self-same sets, gives one a sense of interface and continuance. Of course, the class structure is as dominant a theme in THE REPTILE, only the rotter of PLAGUE, is replaced by the distinguised, now tormented and quite erratic Doctor. The manor, Oakley Court, according to the liner notes is now a luxury hotel. couldn't be a more appropriate facade. Besides being a familiar location near Bray studios, it here functions as kind of ornate class barrier, even moreso, perhaps, than in PLAGUE> The rest of the town is distinctly working class to merchant class, typified by the estimable Michael Ripper in one of his very best turns as the wily innkeeper who is helpful in finally ridding the area of the pestilence. There are only two murders and an exhumation until the climax which doubtless frustrates some who need constant ""action"" if not gore on the menu. But for the patient and discerning the film holds multitiered rewards of a more subtle kind. Perhaps most subtle of all is the quiet interplay of glances and eyes between the superb Jacqueline Pearce and Noel Willman's fallen man. Seeking out a snake-cult in Malaysia he found his goal only to be pursued back to England with a curse hanging over his daughter. Anna turns into a lunging, fanged, green skinned, yellow eyed reptile which agressively goes after anything which gets near it. Death is assured, hideous and painful. Locals call it the Black Death. Erotic currents eddy between daughter and father, and by implication, toward the other men lured into the manor. The subterranean grotto where it retreats to shed is built around a steaming pit of magma, which resonates as kind of a matter dissolving pit where sexual desire and the ancient fluids which will fuel a raging return of the repressed seethe. The performances are superlative here, especially Pearce, Willman and Ripper. The metaphor is a potent one, and elucidated with considerable elegance and suspense, given the set-up, the recycling, the shared cast members and obviously rushed circumstances.

903685,3,6304565062,"Minor suspense thriller from Hammer's House of Horrors.  A remote English village has suffered a rash of grisly deaths among the citizenry.  Nervous men look at each other and say it's heart failure, but that doesn't explain the awful plague-like symptoms.  Down at the local pub, they shun newcomers and pretend there is nothing awry.  Near to this same village, in a gloomy old house, reside a tormented young woman named Anna and her reclusive father.  While in India, Anna corrupted herself by unholy union with a vaguely defined eastern religion that adulates cobras.  Anna now suffers sporadic ""cobra-girl"" incarnations and the dreadful night drips with venomous fear and violent death.  Although fathoming the gruesome killings is secondary to the suspense, much of the story unfolds as a murder mystery, or maybe an old ""Avengers"" episode.  Venerable Michael Ripper, stalwart Hammer character actor, is the publican and the only familiar name among the obscure cast.  Absent the presence of both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, he is the unlikely intellectual force that digs into the mystery.  As with many Hammer Horrors, the movie features late-Victorian sets, furnishings, clothing, and hairstyles enhanced by Technicolor.  We're sorry to say heaving bosoms are missing from this one.  The atmospheric setting is appropriately spooky.  The pace is leisurely and the fiery conclusion is ambiguous enough to permit a sequel (which was never made).  As classic Hammer Horrors go, this film is a lesser effort.  It will satisfy genre fans, and collectors need this one for their home movie shelf, regardless.  Good second feature stuff! ;-)",984441600,,1651,5.268199233716475
903686,2,6304565062,"Hammer did at least one film about each type of monster that was somewhat popular in American monster films in the 1930's and 50's, hence this entry in the Creature from the black lagoon lizard-creature films.  The story  revolves around a couple who move to a village and discover people being  killed in way that causes them to become badly discolored by a cheap  make-up job.  Noel Willman plays a wealthy man with an odd daughter that he  is trying to confine.  This film seems similiar in plot to the Gorgon, only  this film is uneven and less convincing in it's plot.  The acting is  overall decent, but the story is thin and the ending is predictable.  The  monster is amusing beacuse it is hilariously bad.  This is not a terrible  film, but the problems in the story causes it to be only average.  The  Reptile is worth one viewing, but not a whole lot more.",943920000,3,867,4.461538461538462
903827,3,6304565062,"Filmed back-to-back with THE PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES, the 1966 THE REPTILE is among the second-tier of Hammer Horror.  The plot is a bit of a riff on THE WOLF MAN.  When Charles Spalding dies an unexpected death, he leaves his home in Cornwall to his brother Harry and Harry's bride Valerie (Ray Barnett and Jennifer Daniel.)  They are surprised when the villagers prove very unfriendly--and then horrified when eccentric Mad Peter (John Laurie) warns them of an unspecified evil and is then killed himself.  What can be the cause of these odd deaths?  Well, given the title of the film, that's obvious.  But can Harry identify the creature before it kills both him and his wife and who knows how many others?

The performances are quite nice and the film moves at a quick pace.  Even so, this not in the same league of Hammer's best films, and unless you're a diehard fan you may want to give this one a miss--particularly since the DVD seems to be out of print and the price for a copy beyond ridiculous.  But the elements are good, and the film has a few bonuses, including trailer, television spots, and a brief documentary on various female vampire characters created by Hammer over the years.  Enjoyable, yes, but you won't have to hold onto your hat.

903828,5,6304565062,"The Reptile is one of the only Hammer movies I had never seen before starting my collection and the last one I added. I can say I'm sorry
I didn't get it sooner. It doesn't have Cushing or Lee but still has some great actors who appeared in other Hammer movies and it was
written by the great John Elder who wrote many Hammer movies. It's a much better movie than most of the Hammer ones that many
people have seen many times. I never saw this one on the morning monster movie or late night when I was a kid as I did the others.
The story is good and dark and very much like KISS of the Vampire which is also one of my favorites and stars Noel Willman who
plays another strange mad type which he is very good in both roles. He should have been given the chance to play Dracula. But
as the brother and his wife move in next door they realize the father and daughter have a strange secret and they make friends with
the local bar keeper played by the great Michael Ripper who again is in many Hammer films. The creature ""reptile"" is one of the best
monsters ever made for horror movie. Much like Creature from Black Lagoon. Too bad they didn't make a follow up film! The sets
are great and really give it a dark brooding look. The ending is very good also. This is a must have for any Horror or Sci Fi movie fan.",1333411200,3,1310,4.0813953488372094
903829,5,6304565062,"In the mid-sixties, Hammer was looking to find new monsters to add to its continuing cycles of old monsters mostly drawn from Universal's original ""monster movies"" begun in the thirties.  So, Hammer came up with two unique ideas which became 1964's ""The Gorgon"" released by Columbia (and available on DVD in their ""Icons of Horror"" set) which starred Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in bringing a Greek mythological ""monster"" who turned her victims into stone, and also 1966's ""The Reptile"" distributed by 20th Century-Fox and starring Noel Willman, Jennifer Daniel (who had a starring role in Hammer's ""Kiss of the Vampire""), Jacqueline Pearce and Michael Ripper which brought a completely new ""monster"" of a snake-like creature who poisoned her victims with a bite that had the villagers attribute to a wave of the ""black plague"" until the protagonists look beyond the superstitions of the locals in a Victorian Cornish village.  The special effects of the monster make-up of ""The Reptile"" serve the film better than the end result of ""The Gorgon"" with the monster appearing more frightening.  In both films, the monster is shown only fleetingly a few times, but in ""The Gorgon"" for the film-makers it is a relief as the special effects make-up is rather poor for an otherwise good horror film.  ""The Reptile"", written by Hammer's John Elder and directed by John Gilling, who the year before directed another Hammer ""masterpiece,"" ""Plague of the Zombies"" (which I have not yet seen, but which I understand gives George Romero's zombies a run for the money).  Anchor Bay has released this edition with a few extras and trailers.",1329436800,2,1631,5.048327137546468
903830,4,6304565062,"A small village is plagued by a black death that is brought on by a mysterious creature that strikes in the night, and it is up to a newcomer and the town's barkeep to drive out the poison that is quickly diminishing the town's population. This tale is one of two films (PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES being the second) that served as a critical response to British colonialism in to India, with the creature's attacks serving as a form of retribution for the social and political influence that was forced upon the eastern world. While it is much smaller in scope to many of Hammer's other productions, the dimly lit sets, atmospheric exteriors, and brooding score make for a sinister mood. The creature design is impressive for the time outside of a pair of googly eyes, but it is made all the more frightening by Pearce's serpentine figure and movements. THE REPTILE also lacks the star power of the other Hammer greats, but this actually acts in its advantage, with the small cast offering believable low-profile performances that suit the cramped village setting. This entry is an atypical creature feature with unusually high production values for the B-Movie plot.

903831,1,6304565062,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

The movie had this been a genuine product released through Anchor Bay would've received 5 stars.

I threw my money away on:

Dracula Prince Of Darkness

Frankenstein Created Woman

The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires

Save your money until somebody with half a brain decides to do the right things with the old deleted Hammer titles. I'm still very dissatisfied with this scenario.",1260316800,4,1640,4.592465753424658
903832,5,6304565062,"Others have written excellent plot summaries of The Reptile, so I will go right to what I like so much about it:
1. The cast is outstanding.  Michael Ripper, who is in almost all Hammer films and hardly ever plays someone of any intellect, is featured more in The Reptile.  This role is actually a change of pace for him and it's good to see him getting to do more.
2.  The Reptile is a companion piece to Plague of the Zombies--same director, screenwriter, sets, and some of the same cast.  It had to have been made around the same time as Plague.
3.  Anyone who likes Plague of the Zombies (which I consider to be a masterpiece) should like The Reptile.  I think The Reptile is just as well made as Plague--certainly just as atmospheric and suspenseful.

I sometimes get annoyed with the limitations of Hammer films--repeated use of same sets, formula plotting, never actually filming at night, and whatnot.  But when I try to name examples of similarly themed and plotted stories which have been filmed more expertly, I realize there aren't any!
The strengths of Hammer outweigh the weaknesses.

The Reptile is evidently still in print on a double feature version with The Lost Continent.  Since I have chosen not to review The Lost Continent (which is hokey but enjoyable and somewhat imaginative) I'm reviewing the out of print single edition of Reptile.

I highly recommend The Reptile to Hammer devotees and also think it is well enough done to convert others.",1216598400,2,1467,4.713725490196079
903833,4,6304565062,"An original premise, great atmosphere, good cast - this has all the elements we've come to expect from a Hammer gothic horror.

It turns out that the curse of the snake people has been placed upon the daughter of the doctor living in the castle causing her to turn into a reptile periodically and bite people during the process.  The storyline is somewhat cheesy but it is carried out with straight-faced conviction by a good cast of actors.  This is vintage Hammer horror, the acting is solid, the screenplay is coherent, the scenery and sets are attractive and the special effects come off leaving the film's dignity intact.  As others have noted, this movie was made on some of the same sets and with a very similar cast to the ""plague of zombies"" film.

903835,4,6304565062,"Hammer was a class act.  They gave us great films, with lush attention to settings, costumes and location shooting.  They gave you incisive writing, witty dialog (well, most of the time) and they are unsurpassed for creating atmosphere.  They made screen legends out of Lee and Cushing, and brought old horror tells into vivid color, with plenty of sexy-babes around to please the lads.  For some reason, The  Reptile, one of their better efforts works, tends to go unnoticed or dismissed.  Could it be because of the ""creature"" was a mere female instead of the tall dashing Lee?

Well, now that time has passed, people can rediscover this classy Hammer tale.  The Reptile (like the old grade C class The Alligator People) rather lets the cat out of the bag as soon as the title is flashed.  However, stick with the tale and enjoy

Hammer's gorgeous lensing, and excellent location work.  Directed by John Gilling (who directed Lee in Hammer's Pirated of Blood River and a pairing of Lee and Cushing in The Gorgon - two other overlook great films) and written by Anthony Hinds, who pens such other stylish Hammer classics (The Brides of Dracula, the Curse of the Werewolf, Kiss of the Vampire), The Reptile is a moody film.  Ray Barrett and Jennifer Daniel play Harry George Spalding and his wife Valerie, a young couple who inherits the husband's cottage in Cornwall, England after his uncle's mysterious death.  Michael Ripper, the perpetual also ran of Horror, does a fine character role as the tavern owner who helps them.  No sooner than they unpack, they learn a serial killer has been murdering villagers and likely killed Harry's uncle.  The film suffers from the obvious, we know there is a Reptile, so the impact is blunted from the start.

Shot back-to-back with the Plague of the Zombies, if you are familiar with one film, and watch the other, you will recognize the same village for the shoot.  It builds suspense in an understated fashion, creating really spooky atmosphere.  I think this leisurely pace causing some to dismiss this worthwhile film, while those with a more discerning taste will enjoy the non-hysterical approach.",1097020800,4,2145,4.878453038674033

903899,4,6304565062,"The Reptile (1966) is directed by John Gilling, who was also responsible for much better known film, The Plague of the Zombies (1966), released in the same year.  One thing I've noticed about his style of direction is that the pacing is methodical and steady, drawing out the story, focusing on building up to a climatic finish.  That is certainly the case with The Reptile.

The film takes place in a small English village and starts out with a brutal attack that leads to a grisly and violent death of a local man.  The man's brother, Harry George Spaulding (Ray Barrett) arrives with his new wife, Valerie, played by Jennifer Daniel, to take possession of his brother's cottage.  As they arrive to the small town, they notice an underlying sense of dread permeating the air.  The townspeople are wary of strangers, partly due to the number of recent deaths attributed to 'heart failure' for lack of a proper autopsy.  As the young couple moves into the small cottage despite the warnings of a number of local individuals, strange noises are heard, and another death occurs literally at their front door.  The Spaulding's meet their affluent neighbor, Dr. Franklyn (Noel Willman) and his daughter Anna (Jacqueline Pearce).  They soon discover the death of Harry's brother is somehow linked to the Franklyns.

While watching this film, I had an idea of what happening and who the killer was, but I didn't know the circumstances behind why the murders were taking place.  This information is revealed much later, near the end of the film, in a rather clunky chunk of exposition.  I was expecting a much larger conspiracy, something to do with a cult or a little known sect, so I was a little surprised and a little let down when the truth was finally revealed.  It just seemed to me the way the plot played out that this was where it was headed.  Some viewers may consider the pacing to be slow, and it was, but I thought it more deliberate, allowing for us to really get involved with the characters, and I did appreciate it.  There were some minor holes in the story along the way, but they did little to quash my enjoyment of the movie.  The sets, locations, costumes, all worked really well, creating a sense of the time period and atmosphere common to many earlier Hammer releases.  The actors all performed well, really bringing their characters to life.  I would have liked to learned more of the Franklyn's mysterious Indian butler, played by Marne Maitland, who turned out to be much more than a mere servant, as he was a critical character but had little development.  His connections to the Franklyn's was merely touched on, but never truly illuminated.  Roy Ashton's makeup for the snake creature is quite good, and is shown fairly well on the cover of the DVD.  The effect of the snakebite on the various victims was very hideous, involving a darkening of the skin by the bite and foaming at the mouth.  The townspeople, unaware or too scared to look into it further, called the effects the 'black death' for lack of a better diagnosis.

Anchor Bay does a wonderful job releasing this lesser known Hammer movie, providing an excellent print and a number of special features.  Included are theatrical trailer and TV spots, a featurette on Hammer films called `Vamps' narrated by Oliver Reed, and a nice mini card reproducing a movie poster for the film along with Rasputin - The Mad Monk (1966) which led me to believe maybe these two films were released as a double feature.  Not a bad Hammer film, certainly better that some of the other films they released at the end of the 60's and into the 70's as their productions became cheaper and quality suffered.

The similarities in plot point and theme to Hammer's ""The Gorgon"" make ""The Reptile"" less effective than it would have been if I hadn't have seen the other film first.  Actually, ""The Reptile"" is the better of the two films with better acting, a more clever plot, better plot development, a more shocking monster/Monster's First Scene, and it's rather humorous retelling of the Adam and Eve tale.
In this version, it is a Professor of Old Religions and Cults rather than Eve who goes out in search of Knowledge and encounters a secret Snake Cult.  He digs too deeply into their mysteries and the Cult takes out their vengeance in a particularly nasty way.  In this retelling, his penance is exacted from the daughter.  She becomes half-snake, half-human, shedding her skin yearly and using her fangs and venom regularly and without provocation anytime the cult deems her in need of a journey to the depths of her demonic and lesser half.
And when the brother and sister-in-law of a recent victim decide to move into a cottage nearby the Professor's home, his daughter, in her better form, kindly decides to invite them to their last supper just when it is time for her to slither out her role as belly-crawler and redeemer of her father's sins.  The depiction of her penance and eventual death without the usual resurrecting sequel continually fills me with thrills and chills of horror and delight, doing for me in ten minutes what ""The Passion"" does to Believers in two hours.
I only have one complaint...the DVD is too expensive for an old 60s film.  At almost 30 dollars, it is ten dollars more than most all other DVDs available, almost as if it's reserved for the viewing pleasure of only a special, privileged few.  Sort of like porno, yet it's not even incredibly gory or indecent, just an interesting and rare portrayal of an old, important, yet truth-filled theme.  Overall, I love it, it's a fave and a royal hoot of a good time.  Buy it on sale or on special so you won't be disappointed.

Willman's lovely daughter, the inexplicably shy and subdued Jacqueline Pearce, is as friendly to Barrett and his wife as her father is hostile, and inadvertently engages them in what rapidly becomes an ugly murder plot  -  the same one that claimed Barrett's late brother.
This is one of Hammer's better low-budgeters, which suffers from a few flaws:  it's slow moving and a bit padded; the music (as in many films from the same studio in the same period) is overly melodramatic; and the suspense is half-shot from the opening teaser, by explicitly showing precisely the mystery Barrett and Daniels are attempting to solve (though not quite all of its details).  It plays like a turn-of-the-century supernatural murder mystery, which is essentially what it is.
However, it's splendidly acted by all involved, especially Willman and Pearce, who suffer from a guilty secret and a resultant family curse beyond their ability to explain to outsiders.  The sets and props are gorgeous, the scenery beautiful, the atmosphere heavy.  Pearce's makeup is magnificent, even if the papier-mache shows  -  it's a truly striking effect, and properly underused.  There are some very creepy and highly memorable scenes, most notably the finale and one in which Pearce  -  in a genuinely unspeakable condition  -  writhes around on her bed while an insidious Malaysian manservant chants over her body.

903904,3,6304565062,"Another Victorian-styled horror movie from Hammer Films, this one revolves around a retired military officer and his wife (David Baron and Jennifer Daniel) who inherits his brother's cottage in a small Cornish village after the brother dies under mysterious circumstances. When he moves there with his wife, he discovers that there has been a rash of deaths and that all of them can be attributed to a rare poisonous animal found only in remote India. The obvious purpetrator behind these dastardly deeds to the reclusive doctor of theology (Noel Williams) who has made a career out of studying obscure religions in the Far East and who keeps his daughter (Jacqueline Pearce) a virtual prisoner in their manor house. But throw in a mysterious swarthy fellow, the daughter's strangely hypnotic effect on her father when she plays the sitar, and things are a little less clear. Will the newly arrived couple's only ally in the area (Michael Ripper) help them stop the spreading evil before it consumes them all?
""The Reptile"" is the most strongly gothic in genre of all the Hammer horror flicks. There's the ogre-like father and the oppressed daughter; there's the mysterious Outsiders who are bringing a corrupting influence to wholesome British society, and there are curses and victims and victimizers who may not be what they seem. It's a well-mounted film that contains several moments of genuine chills.
""The Reptile"" would have gotten a Five Star rating if not for the inexplicable over-acting displayed by all the principles in the first half of the movie; inexplicable because the leads in the film director John Gillig helmed immediately prior to this one (""The Plauge of the Zombies, which even used many of the same sets) was blessed with beautifully restrained performances that made the film even creepier and more believable. It's even odder because Michael Ripper gives the same type of understanded performance he did in ""Plaugue.""
As the film evolves, the over-blown performances start to fit with the tenor of the going-ons, but they seem so out of place early in the film that it's an irritant. The movie's resolution is also a bit weak, with the title creature going down without much of a fight. The combination of the overacting in the first reel and the shaky climax were enough to knock off a star. Still, it's an entertaining film if you enjoy Hammer-style movies or gothic tales.",1014422400,,2404,4.982587064676617
903905,3,6304565062,"A very good Hammer horror flick. The colors and acting were all good, but there was a slight lack of gore. A few parts were semi-scary enough to make one jump a bit, but not much else.
A couple relocates to a new country town in ... Cornwall I think. Strangely enough, when the new guy enters the town bar, everyone clears out. The bartender explains that they ""don't like strangers.""
A neighbor girl decides a great way to welcome the new couple would be to illegaly enter their house and put flowers all over.
The couple makes friends with the town drunk, who dies after dinner at their house with the ever-present black-face, foaming mouth and ""cobra-like"" bite-marks on his neck. The father of the girl who put flowers all over proves useless as a doctor (they didn't teach any medicine when he got his PhD in Theology).
A strange Indian (as in country) guy lives with the doctor and his daughter and seems to have a strange hold on them. The new couple becomes increasingly curious about the activities at the doc's house and begin snooping.
The plot was fairly predictable, but overall it was a good movie.",1006300800,,1112,4.565
903906,3,6304565062,"If you like your horrorfilms oldfashioned, with fog and faces at the windows and a brave damsel in distress, and don't mind ridiculous monsters, you'll like this one. It's got a lot of atmosphere, some nice characters and creepy scenes, and although it's hardly ever really frightening, it's entertaining. Just the right thing for a rainy evening.",1002672000,,347,5.105263157894737
903907,4,6304565062,"I have a thing for Horror, especially for the 60's, 70's stuff. This here is a truely great one, one of the best Hammer films I've ever seen. It's like a much better version of ""The Golem"" which exposes similar themes. A man moves with his wife to the village where his Brother lived and died ( he died mysteriously ). They inherit his House and soon enough, People start dying. The Townsfolk is scared and bullies the couple, exept for the Barkeeper, who is trying to help them solve the mystery. Could it be that Dr. Franklin has a secret? And who is that creepy servant in his house? And why does he do anything to keep his Daughter at Home?
Everything you want is there : Moors, Spooky Graveyards, A really cool looking Creature ( It would be way cooler if it wasn't on the Box ).
The Acting by everybody is great, nobody hams it up here, which is a good thing. Especially Jacqueline Pearce, I wonder what she's doing now. Her performance shines all around she really makes you feel for her. Hail Jacqueline! Her performance alone makes this movie worth watching. Her performance would make ""Grim"" worth watching.
 One Thing most Monster Movies try but horribly fail is to make us feel for the Monster. This movie doesn't try and I nearly cried at The Reptile's final words. The ""Mad Peter"" Character was funny, his line ""I don't take part in some things that people take so serious these days, for example..."" is hiliarous.
If you're in the Mood for some good ol'fashion Horror, check out the Reptile, it's perfect stuff. Sure there are a lot of plot holes and the suspense doesn't always hold up but still, this is one great movie and shouldn't be forgotten.",1000080000,13,1664,4.509933774834437

The ending is a bit of a letdown, but otherwise the suspense and horror are well done. Being Hammer, I kind of wished the entire time that Peter Cushing had played Dr. Franklyn (the main character). He would have added just the little extra class that could have pushed to film to classic status. Still, I fine .99 cent rental",1515801600,,503,4.478260869565218

7875128,5,6304565062,"I always liked this creepy 1966 British horror A LOT and recently I was happy to find out that it didn't age - AT ALL! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Somewhere around 1910 a certain Harry Spalding (Ray Barrett), a handsome and rather likeable fellow in his late 30s, inherits a cozy cottage after the death of his brother. The house is situated in Cornwall, in the village of Clagmoore Heath. Spalding arrives to take possession of it in company of his recently wed wife Valerie (Jennifer Daniel). Even if local people are not very friendly Spalding and his wife try nevertheless to meet some of them.

They begin with the owner of the neighbouring house, Dr. Franklyn (Noel Willman), a man of formidable appearance and great dignity, who lives with his young daughter Anna (Jacqueline Pearce) and a mute Malay servant (Marne Maitland) he brought with him from the colonies. Young Anna, an 18 or 19 years old sweet thing, cute like a button and clearly on her way to bloom in an amazing beauty, is particularly delighted to have some neighbours and especially some female company... And then the film really begins.

The main thing a horror movie should achieve is to be scary and this film is really REALLY DARN TERRIFYING! The whole atmosphere of this village and the general story line manage to create a climate of fear which blankets even the most innocent scenes - of which there is some... One could almost imagine that an ancient curse of heathen demons was cast on this whole village and all the houses in it - and one would be right... I saw this thing three times, at different moments of my life and I found it always as creepy and scary as during the previous viewing... The grotesque and somehow cheap appearance of the monster which, sadly, is fully shown on the cover of the DVD, doesn't destroy this film - to the contrary, once we actually meet ""The Reptile"", in fact as strange as it may seem things only become SCARIER!

For my personal taste, even if this is a little budget movie with unknown actors, ""The Reptile"" is the best and the scariest Hammer film EVER and a real MONUMENT of horror cinema. ENJOY - if you dare!",1413417600,2,2170,4.585051546391752
7875129,3,6304565062,This film has some really good makeup effects and it really helps the film along the way.  The storyline plods a little for me but it has some fine moments.,1397088000,,156,4.2
