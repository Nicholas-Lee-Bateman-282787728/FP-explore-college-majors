2099706,5,B0002JK76G,More of the same....This is a great series.  A look into another culture and time that is funny without being disrespectful or vulgar.  Truly enjoyable.,1358640000,3,152,5.04
2099707,5,B0002JK76G,"...watch this at home.  If you have a DVD drive in your computer, these discs will be watchable in your computer.  I haven't yet purchased a region-free DVD player (WHY are DVDs made with region codes????  They should have been made like CDs and we wouldn't have to even talk about it...), but I've purchased some of these PAL versions because: (#1) I WILL purchase a region-free DVD player in the future (they are VERY inexpensive and GOOD quality too, believe it or not) and (#2) They are watchable in the meantime on the computer.  Therefore, it's completely fine with me that these are being sold to U.S. customers.  Plus, MANY of these episodes are currently unavailable in the U.S. due to the inexplicably SLOW and ERRATIC release schedule of BBC America.  Are they throwing darts at the list of seasons that remain unreleased or what??  THAT'S what we should REALLY be complaining about...",1295827200,,896,4.779220779220779
2099708,5,B0002JK76G,"These series continue the escapades of the geriatric trio, Campo, Foggy, and Norman and begins to introduce more guest stars and recurring characters.  Personally, I find that this series gets better as it moves forward with the addition of more players.  These two are much better than the first two, and Series 5 and 6, which have just become available, are even better than Series 4 and 5.  I just wish that they would speed up the introduction of the series.  And, why, oh why, don't we have these in the U. S. in an NTSC version?",1158451200,10,534,4.474226804123711
2099709,1,B0002JK76G,"$78?  For only one set of LOSW dvds?  Don't pay such a ridiculous markup!

Forget that-- if you're set with your region-free dvd player, just check out LOSW (and many other unavailable-in-US UK programs) on the UK Amazon site-- I've purchased both available dvd sets (Seasons 1 & 2; Seasons 3 & 4) for under $40US, including shipping!

One star is for the price here, but four stars for the series itself!!",1150156800,23,406,4.597222222222222

8028233,5,B0002JK76G,"I love this series and it is great to see the episodes in order on the DVD since we don't get them here in America much anymore, and we never got all the episodes.",1419638400,,163,3.823529411764706
8028234,5,B0002JK76G,"I would much rather watch a series that has a (giant plastic) carrot chase rather than a car chase, and this one delivered it! Good product, good service, good condition, good price.",1398729600,,182,4.71875
8028235,5,B0002JK76G,"What can be said about England's three Amigos that hasn't already been said,nothing just more quality humour and fun from the beginnings of the Lads time together.",1394496000,,163,5.074074074074074
8028236,5,B0002JK76G,"Charming classic British TV--nothing hectic or overly dramatic or hysterically funny.  Just a slow-moving, amusing little show.  As a senior myself, I thoroughly understood the men's need to be active and do the things they may not have time to do when working--no matter how strange.  No one does sit-coms better than the Brits!",1386633600,,329,5.055555555555555
