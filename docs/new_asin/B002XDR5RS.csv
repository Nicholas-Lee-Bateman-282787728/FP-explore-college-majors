8383608,5,B002XDR5RS,Great vintage (or antique?) footage of Indy racing and cars!,1442102400,,60,5.1
8383609,5,B002XDR5RS,"Talkies were present by the time this film was made but it was done as silent film with a soundtrack.  The film industry wasn't entirely certain at this point in time if spoken dialogue in film was the wave of the future or just a fad.  But it doesn't really matter because William Haines acts up a storm at Indianapolis for the big, annual race.  He delivers another performance that covers all the bases, from his trademark bravura, to hysterical clowning, to tears.  In some ways silent film was superior to talkies because dialogue tends to dampen the free expression of a truly gifted actor.  Just think of Chaplin and Keaton.",1432771200,,631,4.648648648648648

8383613,5,B002XDR5RS,"A little silly in the story, but who cares ?
The racing footage is so cool, & gives you a view of the days when there was nothing but a leather helmet between the driver and death.",1377216000,,180,3.891891891891892
8383614,3,B002XDR5RS,"William Haines performance is often mannered and broadly comedic in a drama that the other actors play seriously.  It would have been better if he had played it straight, or the movie had been written as a comedy.

Footage of the 17th Annual Decoration Day Indy 500 in 1928 is intercut with a California brick race track that I can't identify.  Most of the race car footage is at the beginning and end of the film.

In the middle of the film is a visit to an airport featuring a Maddux Airlines Ford Tri-motor, and a two place open cockpit low wing monoplane with fixed gear, in actual air to air footage and a decent model.",1373155200,,624,4.353448275862069
8383615,3,B002XDR5RS,"My fault. Sometimes old time movies are not was what you thought they would be., but would reoder  from this company",1358035200,,116,4.523809523809524
8383616,5,B002XDR5RS,"William Haines is now forgotten for the most movie fans. But he was once one of the biggest silent movie star like Rudolph Valentino, Ramon Novarro - and the first one where was openly gay in the film business. There is available a Biography about him by ""William J. Mann"".

To this DVD / movie:

Wow, the score is new recorded and not boring like other silent movies scores with organ pipe etc.

The picture quality is for a movie of this age very good.

Fazit: I love it (but my favorite is still ""West Point"" with William Haines)",1278460800,,532,4.343434343434343
8383617,4,B002XDR5RS,"This movie dates from the sometimes rocky transition period between pure silents and the talkies, when studios still were not sure of themselves. Thus, it has an enjoyable period musical score (comprised largely of popular songs of the day) and racing car sound effects, but is still ""silent"", with dialogue presented on the usual intertitles. It is most enjoyable, and showcases the comedic and dramatic talents of William Haines, one of my favorite actors from this era (and extremely popular in his day). Some others of his movies to watch out for (until recently very obscure, but also released by Warner Archives) are ""West Point"" (a pure silent) and ""Navy Blues"" (an early all-talkie, and not nearly as creaky as some of these could be, in large part because of Billy Haines's wonderful acting). One thing, though: these are all much cheaper when purchased directly from WB Archives website.",1277683200,3,897,5.026845637583893
