7977619,4,B00006CXJ2,"There is enough meat in these diminutive vignettes to aid the classroom instructor in introducing several major historical philosophers. For this reason I encourage all philosophy instructors to take a serious look at the series. There are not many products like this on the market.  Now for the down side, the sequences are slow and almost boring. Speakers use enough philosophical jargon to make the eyes of armchair thinkers glaze over.  Each vignette just takes a few minutes, therefore they are best used to set up discussion when introducing a new character or to close discussion after students have a vague understanding of the characters.

Just to make it clear:

For the classroom: Yes
For the living room : No

The first time I ordered this series, I ordered both the Eastern & Western series and had them placed in my college library.  Later when I ordered a second set for my personal use I saved the extra money and only ordered the Western dvd. Enough enformation exists on Eastern Philosophy I felt I could find something I liked better.",1198108800,15,1053,4.822222222222222
7977620,3,B00006CXJ2,"I recently bought the book the history of western philosophy by Bertrand Russell which I liked very much. I was expecting that this VHS would bring to life philosophers. Unfortunately, the budget was low and you mostly see experts (from excellent European and American universities) talking about philosophers. The images that you get are low-budget. For instance, when they say that Plato talked about the perfect city,ordered society and citizens, they show random images of people walking in the streets of today's London. They do have some shots of the ruins of Athens and show paintings of philosophers but that is it. Rather poor if you think for instance about PBS's The Greeks which is not a five star as well in terms of recreation of Greek life but it has definetly more relevant illustration's than the streets of London!",1062201600,7,832,4.95
7977621,3,B00006CXJ2,"I purchased this video series for an Introduction to Philosophy class I was teaching. The quality of the videos is fairly good although not nearly as good as something produced by A&E or PBS.
The selection of the philosophers was appropriate, thus the right people were examined. There were a a couple of negatives, though. First, major beliefs of several of the key philosophers were often not mentioned or they were addressed inadequately. For example, if you read almost any philosophy book that mentions Aquinas, much attention is given to Aquinas' five proofs for God's existence. But in this video, barely a word was said about this. This is just one of many examples where very key information was not addressed.
Second, the quality of the expert testimony on the tapes leaves something to be desired. About half of the experts in the video are good or excellent, but the other half are often difficult to understand or lack the communication skills necessary to successfully express ideas on video. Because of their academic credentials, these experts are no doubt extremely intelligent, but some of them lacked the ability to communicate what needed to be communicated.
To sum up, the video series is not bad, but it's not great either. I would like to see some group do a quality job that would be comparable to what PBS or A&E does.",1060819200,6,1343,4.843478260869565
