The Heat and There's Something About Mary are movies that you should definitely own yourself or give to people you care about for a fun holiday gift. The Heat was a big movie hit from this past year, while There's Something About Mary is a hit from 1998.

The Heat stars Sandra Bullock who plays FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn and Melissa McCarthy who plays Boston Detective Shannon Mullins.  The plot is pretty simple, it centers on the two of them trying to take down a mobster.  But don't let the simplicity deter you from this movie, its a great movie with alof of heart. The movie is directed Paul Feig who created the critically acclaimed show Freaks and Geeks and directed the 2011 hit, Bridesmaids.  This movie is alot of fun and you can tell that Bullock and McCarthy were having alot of fun while making this movie.  I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.

The second movie from this combo pack is There's Something About Mary.  The movie features Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller.  The movie is directed by Farrelly brothers (Bobby and Peter).  The movie is funny and has some iconic scenes in it that will have you laughing after the movie is over.  Readers of Total Film magazine voted There's Something About Mary the 4th greatest comedy film of all time.

I feel this combo pack is a good deal and that it would make a great gift for yourself or a holiday gift, and I would definitely recommend it.

Thank you for reading my review.",1386115200,3,1544,4.530685920577618
