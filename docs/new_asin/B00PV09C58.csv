8689394,5,B00PV09C58,"So very underrated. I really loved how the movies wasn't afraid to go places. It was dark, gritty, and enjoyable. If you're a fan of movies that want you to piece things together then this is for you. The casting was awesome and I loved the premise.",1515974400,,249,4.319148936170213
8689395,1,B00PV09C58,"This movie has a couple good actors, but unfortunately it didn't make the movie any better.  This movie tries too hard to be one of those ones where it has twists and turns to try and make you go ""WOW!  I didn't see that coming!""  If you really must see this, I suggest you rent first.  This movie deserves 0 stars!",1507593600,,315,4.114754098360656
