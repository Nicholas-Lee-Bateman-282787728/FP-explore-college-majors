7843362,5,6303316018,"My sweetie got me into this when it first appeared on TV.
I'm not usually into mysteries, esp. murder mysteries; but the acting and cinematography is awesome.
Now that I own the entire BBS production of Ellis Peters' stories; I'm going to have to read the books.
Anything that translates this well to a television format must be a great read.
It doesn't matter if you like murder mysteries or not; this series is well worth watching.",1360540800,,433,4.636363636363637
7843363,4,6303316018,"In this episode, a handsome young juggler and minstrel is accused of murder and robbery even while the man he supposedly murdered is still alive. He runs to the Abby and begs sanctuary, which is good for forty days. So Brother Cadfael has that time to find out who did assault and rob the goldsmith. The only clue is a single coin stuck in the bucket of the well, and it is picked up by ""a simple lad,"" the assistant of another of the tradesmen of Shrewsbury. Unfortunately, he did not recognize its significance and simply pocketed it.

There are lovers and haters, liars and innocents, and poor Brother Cadfael must sort them all out. So when the butcher, the town gossip, also turns up dead, things get very complicated indeed. Still, this murder provides some clues to the original crime, and of course the clever Cadfael sorts it all out in an hour and a quarter.

Since there are ten of these, I won't continue to describe the basic setting and characters of the entire series. See the earlier reviews as necessary.",1336780800,,1021,4.573770491803279
