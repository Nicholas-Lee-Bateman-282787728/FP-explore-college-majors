8270393,5,B000006BV8,"This 10 VHS set from Madacy entertainment contains some great films from Hollywood's Golden Age. Being that it IS from Madacy means Quality suffers over quanity. These films were likely taken from 16mm unrestored sources and transfered to tapes recorded in EP mode. The downside is, many of these films are public domain, and some will probably never be restored. The quality though is acceptable, just not prisitne. The packaging is beautiful and the shiny gold ""Hollywood Romance"" lettering is a nice touch. I do reccomend getting this set for lower than $10, unless you have better quality versions of the films contained already.
