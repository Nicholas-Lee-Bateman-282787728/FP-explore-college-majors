2006540,5,B0001JXP16,"This is one of the few films I've ever seen where looks and gestures actually communicate more loudly than any words. Olivier's facial expressions are absolutely perfect, and we don't need anyone telling us what he's thinking - or even him talking about what he's thinking to someone else (which is what surely would have happened if this had been a Hollywood film).

Not much happens in this movie - at least in terms of events. What does happen is touching and startling. You wonder why Olivier is following his new carpentry apprentice (Francis) through the street, and you're pretty certain that you know why, based on the title of the film and Olivier's own reactions. But you soon learn that you're wrong. And you're so wrong that it's really quite a shocker.

The ending has just the right amount of suspense, tension, and tenderness - and you will not likely forget this film for a very long time.",1094169600,4,905,4.685534591194968
2006541,4,B0001JXP16,"THE SON is a quiet film that ends up shouting its agony through silence.  Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne have filmed what at first appears to be just an ordinary working class man's life (Olivier, a carpenter with apprentices, played with subtle perfection by Olivier Gourmet), following it closely, slyly introducing Olivier's ex-wife (Isabella Soupart) with whom he no longer has contact save for a tragedy they share, and then darkens the picture with the presence of a 16 year old apprentice Francis (Morgan Marinne) who we instantly know has some mystery behind him.  Olivier watches the boy's every move, discovers that the boy has just been released form prison where he was incarcerated since age 11 for theft and murder.  Olivier realizes this is the boy responsible for his son's death five years ago and he takes Francis under his wing, his motivation remains unsure until the film's surprising end. This is verismo at its peak - just an emotionally charged story, simple, without accoutrements.  There is no music soundtrack, only silence and very very little dialogue.  But because of this starkness, the significance of the movie is all the more powerful.  Perhaps this film is not for everyone: patience and a parcel of time are required to savour it.  But THE SON is one of those films that stays in you gut long after the viewing.",1092268800,10,1345,4.898678414096916
2006542,4,B0001JXP16,"Sure, there is little plot to speak of, but this modest film still manages to fascinate with its psychological vagueness. Yes, it's slow, and yes, there isn't any action. I really didn't notice the camera ""shakiness""--after the ""Bourne Supremacy"" car chase nothing will make my stomach churn as violently, not even ""The Riddler"" at Magic Mountain. This movie is a character study, which is why there are only two actors credited in the DVD filmography. The film lasers in on the complex feelings of anger and forgiveness a man feels after losing his son, and then finding out that perhaps his murderer isn't so different than the deceased boy. It plays out like a tense game of cat and mouse: does Olivier plan to somehow injure the teen, or does he want to seek redemption by digging into the boy's psyche and seeing what dwells there? Is the boy remorseful? Or did the time spent in prison harden him, and make him a potential recidivist?

  The ending is rather abrupt, but it was a refreshing change of pace from the meldramatic predictability of mainstream films. The last ten minutes for me were extremely intense. Gestures and words could be misinterpreted and deemed dangerous. I enjoyed this movie because I worked with troubled adolescents in a  psychiatric center, and despite some of their repulsive qualities, they displayed surprising vulnerability that would appeal to even the most jaded counselors. Some of the kids were predators, but the majority just wanted to feel valued. Can you forgive someone for a shocking act that tears a life apart? Or will you respond with hatred and anger and possibly repeat a vicious cycle that leaves no survivors emotionally intact? Will rejecting the boy make him less empathetic toward others? Or will acceptance change the very behavior that led to the boy's senseless killing and incarceration? These are important questions that are relevant to America's juvenile justice system.",1092009600,3,1936,5.003105590062112
2006543,2,B0001JXP16,"I cannot believe I wasted an hour-and-half of my own boring life to watch someone else's even more boring life on screen. It's hard to imagine this film was included in Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival. I understand all the themes and emotional subtexts and mumbo-jumbo, but this movie is plain crap. Not just crap but plain and dull crap. There's no background music and extremely minimal dialogue (and very uninteresting dialogue mind you). The plot is... well.. not much of one. Not to mention this film has one of the most inconclusive endings I have ever witnessed. This movie is supposedly driven by it's characters, but I felt they were just completely ordinary characters for a completely ordinary movie. The only thing that came off as interesting was the way the film was shot. But even the shaky camera technique lost all its fun by the end. There was a lot of praise and favorable word of mouth surrounding this movie, but I wound up severely disappointed.

 >> 2 stars for little to no entertainment value whatsoever.

2006544,5,B0001JXP16,"With some staggery candid camerawork and next-to-none minimalistic soundtrack, which is no doubt rather demanding on the senses, The Son manages to lay a gruelling texture of moral dilemma and the intrigue that goes with it.
Olivier Gourmet plays a carpenter, with an uncanny ability to judge the metric distance between any two points on a board, perhaps a metaphor for his character's moral precision. (I have never seen Gourmet before, but if wins awards, I will know exactly why.)
This carpenter develops a liking to a younger apprentice. It's eventually revealed that this liking is linked to a tragedy in the past, that continues to cast a pall over several of the film's characters. I will not not dilvulge the exact nature of that tragedy, that'd spoil the enigma, but the film is relentless in outlining its ramifications -- the angst, guilt, confusion, and how the carpenter finds himself both drawn to and repulsed by the youngster.
The overall ambience of the film may be bleak and murky, but its pervasive human spirit is very rewaring for all the patience it demands. Not recommended for casual filmgoers, but a very meditative example of arthouse for the more discerning eye.",1090022400,7,1190,4.955
2006545,5,B0001JXP16,"This is a marvellous film.  For me anyway, it constitutes  a masterpiece. This is certainly not a film for anyone looking for easy excitement. As the central protaganist slowly comes to realise, meaning is something that reveals itself after a great deal of attentiveness and work. The meaning is in the attentiveness and patience to detail, and there is certainly plenty of detail in this finely crafted work. It is this description of the ordinary that constitues its deeply spiritual core. There is revelation at the end, but it is a quiet, understated yet realistic opening out to a greater awareness.
In a word, the film deals with such issues as anger, revenge, hurt, incomprehension, and maybe more importantly, it is a subtle study of the often mysterious workings of patience, understanding, love and forgiveness.  The graphic on the DVD jacket  foregrounds very well one of the central metaphors of this film, namely, that we all need to find, from somewhere, the grace and humility needed to carry one's cross through life. This is definitely a film to be savoured more than once.",1087776000,5,1091,4.945355191256831
2006546,1,B0001JXP16,"I love a good film and generally abhor effects flix that lack good writing, good dialogue and heart (like the Lord of the Rings series). Give me reality! But don't give me a home movie passing itself off as art, as with The Son.
This movie was poorly shot and insufferably paced. When people sit, they sit and sit and sit and sit. When they drive, they drive and drive and drive and drive. When they look, they look and look and look and look. Have these film makers never heard of editing? We get the point! Forty minutes into this cinematic water torture, I was thanking Hitachi for the Fast Foreword button on my remote.
It's no exaggeration to say that most of this film consists of the back of Gourmet's head (he really needs to get that growth behind his right ear looked at) and other shots taken inches from the characters' faces. The occasional long shot comes as blessed relief. It also seems the cameramen attended the Blair Witch school of cinematography (if it can be called that). The handheld videocam nonsense will have any person with an alimentary canal reaching for Dramamine or Ginger within minutes. It's a wonder I can type, as I'm literally reeling from motion sickness.
Suffice it to say that The Son is a story that any film maker who knows how to frame a shot and edit could have told in 40 minutes. It also has one of the most inconsequential endings of all time.  Indeed, I rewound just to make sure the DVD hadn't skipped.  Perhaps it really did skip--just as I should have skipped this pretentiously boring waste of time.",1085616000,12,1551,4.516014234875445
2006547,5,B0001JXP16,"This is an excellent but sadly neglected French film.
The cast, Olivier Gourmet, as the Carpentry Teacher and Morgan Marinne, as his student, are routinely excellent.
As is the story and direction, by the Dardenne brothers who have come up with a strikingly original film.
The story, of Olivier, a Carpentry teacher who teaches teenage
offenders picks up when we learn that his latest student is responsible for the murder of Olivier's infant son in a robbery.
The convicted fellon, Francis, now being rehabilated with a trade, is a gentle, quiet boy, but all the same we view him threw Olivier's eyes, detached, ambivalent but with deep suspicion.
Does Olivier intend revenge or is he only seeking answers.
He becomes so close to the boy that Francis asks Olivier innocently, if he'll become his guardian.
The denouement of this movie, where the main two characters travel alone to a deserted timber yard, is wonderfully handled. It will keep you guessing right to the end.
A fantastic film, expertly produced, excellently acted.
The film is subtle but also absorbing. A real must see!",1081209600,9,1086,4.972527472527473
2006548,4,B0001JXP16,"A film from Beigium directed by brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (""Rosetta"").  Like Rosetta, ""The Son (Le Fils)"" explores the emotional turmoil of the protagonist, and watching the process would be torment to some people.  Still, great acting of Oliver Gourmet is so impressive that those fans who respect the realistic approach to human behavior will be satisfied with the end result.
Olivier (Olivier Gourmet) is working at a carpentry school, but when a new student Francis is sent to the class, he starts to act a little strangely.  He is clearly interested in Francis, but he is also afraid of having it known by the others.  But he still keeps on peeping at him from behind the wall, not knowing what to do with himself.  But why?
The reason is revealed after 30 minutes (and if you don't want to know it, skip this paragraph).  The fact is, Olivier knew Francis killed his son.  Still. Olivier takes Francis as a new student, teaching the craft of carpenrty works.  Laconic Francis (not knowing the identity of Olivier) begins to feel attached to the teacher, but ... what is Olivier really thinking about?  Revenger?  Forgiveness?  Or he does not know his true mind either?
""The Son"" goes on like this, without superfluous dialogues, shot with a hand-held camera.  Each take goes on very long, sometimes several minutes without cut, and often the image is shot behind the head of Olivier, as if letting us share his viewpoint.  Evidently the directors did thorough rehearsals before shooting, because each shot is realized with the calculated movement of camera.
But the real virtue of the film lies in Olivier Gourmet (seen also in ""Read My Lips"" and others), who gives a terrific acting full of nuance and emotion.  The troubled mind of Olivier comes so natural onto the screen that you almost forgive the film's too arty attitudes (no soundtrack, for instance, like Dogme films).  Frankly, I think that ""The Son"" is a kind of film that appeals more critics than to general audiences.  But Olivier Gourmet's performance is a genuine one.
Director Luc Dardenne says that the film is partly inspired by the real-life murder case in Liverpool in 1993.  Probably English people remember the case I refer to.  As his comment shows, the film deals with an immediate topic in a unique way, and like reality itself, ""The Son"" is often ambiguous, which becomes the strength of it.  Not my cup of tea, I admit, but still well worth watching.",1080950400,7,2446,4.8086124401913874

The apprentice is blithely unaware of this background, after having spent 5 years in a juvenile center.  He looks up to the teacher as a trade tutor and even asks him to become his guardian.

As Olivier drives the two of them out to a remote lumber yard, the viewer wonders what impulse will prevail - revenge or forgiveness.  This is a suspenseful movie that may not be everyone's cup of tea, due to the flat expression of the main character and the lack of a tidy resolution.",1201910400,,610,4.324561403508772

2006606,4,B0001JXP16,"This Belgian film tells a story of grief and redemption as a teacher in a vocational training center takes on a young student, who is just released from prison, to teach him the fundamentals of carpentry. We watch for a half hour a kind of cat and mouse game between the two of them before we discover the reason for the teacher's initial reluctance to take on the boy as a student and his reticence about the choice he's made. Divorced and living an isolated existence, the man (Olivier Gourmet) seems deadened by whatever has happened in his life, his face an expressionless mask as he goes about the tasks of the day, always in his carpenter's pants and his leather back support - like someone trapped.

Choosing to be the boy's teacher, he embarks on an unlikely attempt to recover the life that has been robbed from him, and what he begins is a process of redemption both for himself and the boy. The film - shot with handheld camera in a cinema verite documentary style - is demandingly unconventional in the way it tells its story, leaving us for long periods in the dark about what we are watching, then revealing volumes in sudden unexpected bursts of dialogue. Inspired by the murder of a small boy by two older boys in England in the early 1990s (as explained by the Dardenne brothers in a DVD interview), the film explores extremes of emotion - rage and grief - and it offers a brave vision of resolution and recovery.",1192233600,3,1430,4.521235521235521
2006607,5,B0001JXP16,"This stark, unnerving drama by the esteemed Dardenne brothers skirts the themes of reckoning and vengeance without committing fully to either one, yet it packs a mighty emotional punch. In a brilliant, haunting performance, Gourmet plays an ordinary tradesman whose motivations, like his emotions, are completely unfathomable: Is he planning to reform Francis, or kill him? With the Dardennes' tight, handheld camerawork, we are immersed in the claustrophobic, indecipherable world of Olivier's body language, and the effect is chilling.

2006609,4,B0001JXP16,"THE SON is a quiet suspenseful film that leaves the viewer actively guessing as to what is happening much of the time, and as soon as a conclusion is drawn, it is stripped from the viewer's mind and new thoughts emerge. In the beginning we meet a woodworking teacher named Oliver. He seems distant but his curiosity is piqued when he learns of a new student who is to enter the school. We later learn he is divorced and his wife ex-wife is about to be married and is expecting a child. We then learn that Oliver had once had a son who was killed and the new student in the school is involved. Oliver seems to have a genuine interest in the young man who killed his son as well as a hatred and resentment combined with the need for answers that will never be adequate. He's unaware of what to do with his feelings through much of the film. Giving too many more details would ruin the film for a first time viewer, so I'll end the plot summary now.

This is a film for people who like stories that are intriguing and develop slowly. It is also best enjoyed by a person who does not need excess dialogue and appreciates how mannerisms and emotions can often say more than dialogue. It's not a film that's action packed which for me, made it so powerful. The film ends with more questions than answers, but given the enormous subject and the complexities of such a situation, making a viewer think is in itself a feat of artistry and a mark of success.",1141776000,,1448,4.304029304029304
2006610,4,B0001JXP16,"French film of a carpentry industrial arts teacher who harbors a secret connection to one of his students. Very slow-going with long stretches of mundane actions like sawing wood, interspersed with subtle plot developments that reward and hook the involved viewer to the tension mounting story. Mostly a character study, expertly done, with a concluding morale of forgiveness that is significant and sympathetic, but seems less than the film's dramatic strengths.",1126051200,3,463,5.535211267605634
2006611,4,B0001JXP16,"I warn you, please do not read any of the reviews about this movie until you have seen it. I will not describe the plot to you because I feel it is best to walk in cold. The movie is complex with emotions and a major plot twist that is better left unsaid.

 The movie was directed by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and brother Luc Dardenne. It was nominated at the Cannes Film Festival for the top prize, the Golden Palm, and was awarded ""Best Actor"" to Olivier Gourmet who plays Olivier in the film. Also, Morgan Marinne, who plays the young boy, was nominated for a Cesar Award (the equivalent of the Oscar in France) for ""Most Promising Actor"".

 ""The Son"" tackles some pretty big topics but handles them in a sincere way. We come to believe in these characters, especially Olivier, even though we are not quite sure where this film is headed. Olivier has two sides to him, on one hand he seems like a nice guy and on the other seems malicious. The big subject here is forgiveness. How far would we go to understand those who have caused you harm? But, I've said too much. I realize this is a very vague review, but after you've seen the movie you will thank me.

 Here is a movie I recommend to all those who are interested in foreign films and are sick of the big budget brain dead Hollywood films being released this time of year.

 I want to say one thing about the film's ending. After watching it some may feel it ends too abruptly. It does not. The movie ends at just the right moment. There is nothing else that could have been added. We know all we need to know about where these people are headed. Please do not complain about the conclusion.

 Bottom-line: Subtle, powerful film that seems to sneak up on you. We are never quite sure where the film is going to take us but it manages to deal with its material in a convincing way.",1119312000,15,1834,4.305232558139535

The son was in the way of a burglery by another child. The child thief reacted by killing the son, who was in the way of his prize. The father apparently loses his marriage and focuses all his energy on work and the mechanical aspects of life. NO fun seems to be occuring in this fathers life. Things start to change when the father meets the son's murderer. The movie is very dry as is the father, yet it takes a turn just at the end. The director's also did Rosetta, which was also a real gritty down to earth film, very human. This film reaches down to soul level,in some ways, if you can sit with the silence and slowness of this art film.

2006613,5,B0001JXP16,"The two brothers Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne directed Rosetta (1999), which won the Golden Palm in 1999.  This time the two brothers bring another unique tale of social importance to the audience in a spectacular story with wisdom, integrity, and artistic value.  The Son has some resemblance with Rosetta in regards to the cinematography, which might be compared to the Dogma 95 style.  However, this time the two brothers maximize the potential of the camera technique as it serves its ultimate purpose in the story telling.

The camera follows Olivier (Olivier Gourmet), a carpenter teacher at an institution for troubled adolescents, wherever he travels.  The audience is allowed to peak over Olivier's shoulder to see what he sees and gradually enter his world.  Frenetically, Olivier runs around in the building while peaking through windows, around corners, and he makes up excuses to be in locations where he can stare undisturbed at a young male adolescent.  Slowly the audience begins to make their own assumptions to why Olivier does what he does.

Olivier eventually gets enough courage to approach the head of the institution as he requests that the new boy, whom he has been secretively stalking, is transferred from the metal craft department to the carpentry department for which he is the supervisor.  The head of the institution agrees to Olivier's request, and shortly after he picks up the young adolescent from the metal craft department.  Olivier brings the boy to the carpenter department where he closely examines him with his eyes, and provides work pants and tools for him.

The film might appear dreary at first, but this is essential, as the audience will be rewarded for its cerebral participation in the story of the Belgian carpenter Olivier.  Through Olivier the Dardenne brothers dissect the audience's perception and participation in the story through what psychologists might call the attribution theory.  Through this the film tells an extraordinary story of an ordinary man and his uncharacteristic relationship to a teen.

The Dardenne brothers' minimalist approach to the story does not offer any extravagant flamboyance, which might be seen in Oscar winning films.  There are no symbolisms, no analogies, nor additional visual syntaxes to what is ordinarily supposed to be within each frame to enhance a film.  The script tells more than what is in the lines, yet it does not provide any clear indications in what direction it is venturing until the very end.  The audience is merely suspended to their own knowledge and wisdom as they begin to interpret what the film depicts.

However, this film goes considerably overboard in what I think was a contrived attempt to be ""artsy"".

However, it still could have been a compelling film if it weren't for the camera work.  The entire film was shot in extreme close up.  I literally got a headache (and I rarely get headaches!) as the perspective was so distorted.  It was like having a hour and a half conversation with someone who isn't familiar with the concept of personal space and had their face two inches from yours.  Worse yet, at many points as the characters being filmed moved around slightly the camera didn't follow them so you would have a close up of their shoulder for several seconds or the back of their head or whatever.  Let me put it this way, the main actor has some sort of slight growth on the back crevice of his right ear which, by the end of the film, I became WAY to familiar with.

8013400,4,B0001JXP16,"This is a film from 2002 made in France and originally released as `Le Fils'. It tells the story of Olivier (Olivier Gourmet - great name that) who teaches carpentry at a centre for wayward youths, including young offenders. He has a bad back a failed marriage and a past that still haunts his present day.

Then he is asked to teach a young boy, Francis, who is straight out of the detention centre. He refuses at first, but after reading his file he changes his mind. He clearly has a keen interest in this boy and it is reciprocated by the youth. Then we find out why he is so interested and it becomes a complete game changer.

So is it any good? Well as ever that depends upon the viewer, this is not `art house' it is filmed in real time, no music, minimal lighting and real locations. They even use a steady hand cam for most of the filming. Because of the use of real locations, there is often a feeling approaching claustrophobic and lends itself to docudrama. This is fine as it adds to the realism but from a viewing perspective actually can detract from being engaging. However, this there is a web being spun and the more it is woven the more the intrigue builds. I found myself constantly trying to double guess how it would end and getting it mostly wrong, so that is a good thing.

The acting is all superb and the production is almost unnoticeable as that was what was being aimed for, so nothing to criticise on that front. This will not be for everyone, but has generally received very positive reviews indeed, I would recommend to viewers who are open to European cinema in all its varying shades as this does deal with some `dark' issues.",1368057600,2,1659,4.397394136807818

The plot, which is actually quite thick, is made to feel almost breezy, yet squeezes your heart when ultimately revealed. The interwoven mastery between complexity of flesh and simplicity of soul is breathtaking.

It is my belief that the French have mastered the qualities of fine film making over the past 15-20 years. And this film suggests they'll continue dominating this field.

If you love good film making, don't miss out on this treasure. It is not ""artsy"" nor ""noir-ish."" It's just pure genius.",1364515200,2,602,4.9504950495049505

You have to enjoy forming and testing your own hypotheses about the motivations of the people you're watching.  If you're that kind of person, this quiet, subtle film is gripping and intense.

Profoundly moving and ultimately life-affirming, The Son is a highly intelligent film, an unforgettable experience, a true MASTERPIECE of cinema.

8013403,5,B0001JXP16,"The Belgian Dardenne brothers (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) are renowned (mainly in Europe) for their intense minimalist dramas.  Following on the success of Rosetta (1999) which won the prestigious Palm d'Or and La Promese (1996), the brothers embarked on the rigorously stylistic Le Fils (2002).

I must issue a warning for readers: any mention of the plot ruins this film.  Everything is a spoiler!  This is true since only view of the world the audience sees is through (well over the shoulder) the eyes of the emotionally restrained main character, Oliver (Olivier Gourmet -- won Best Actor at Cannes for this role) and main narrative threads are only slowly revealed by him.

The briefest summary I can give without completely spoiling this wrenching emotional experience is this: Olivier, who works teaching carpentry to male teenagers (many are delinquents seeking a vocation), develops an obsession with one of his charges Francis (Morgan Marinne).

The reason for his behavior is revealed half-way through the film. Le Fils also employs an intense, and occasionally nauseating, cinematography.  This might seem surprising and even somewhat distracting in a movie with very little action, however, the Dardenne brothers use this style to adeptly create extreme naturalism.  This is further facilitated by the absence of a film score and the presence of Olivier in every frame.  All in all, these choices hypnotically draw the reader into Oliviers world -- we see every minute emotion his stoic face betrays, his every inflection speaks volumes, his every action -- even the most routine and every deviation from the routine -- reflect his emotional state.  However, this intense character study is only for the most stalwart of movie goers.

Le Fils is a masterpiece.  Although the plot is simplistic, the delivery is impeccable.  I intensely emphasized with both characters and suffered with them.  A truly disorienting and haunting film which every true cinema lover must experience!",1281657600,6,1995,5.272151898734177

Despite high production values and good acting, there's not much story, not much action....basically, not worth watching or buying.",1266019200,3,350,4.9491525423728815
8013405,4,B0001JXP16,"I found it interesting that a man, who hated the boy who killed his son, could have a change of heart after meeting him, and tutoring him for a while. The Son is is a compelling story of inner emotions.",1249948800,,202,4.075
8013406,5,B0001JXP16,"I watched this film for the first time about two years ago for a French cinema course.  At the time I liked the film, but, like the rest of the class, found it just a tad boring.  Time passed, and the film stuck in my mind - more so than most of the other films that we had watched for the class.  I decided to check out some of the brothers other films, and after watching and loving ""L'enfant"" and ""Le Promesse"" I decided to return to ""The Son"".

The second-viewing made all the difference.  Having now formed a better idea of the Dardenne's style, this time I was blown away by what was among the most involving film-watching experiences I'd ever had.  Rather than boring, this time I found it to be tremendously moving, with an ending that left me shaking.  The story is simple, yet best left unspoiled for those who have not had a chance to experience the film. The performances are uniformly excellent, conveying immense emotion with the smallest of gestures.  The directors have the rare ability to turn everyday events into something profound - something intelligent and moral and even spiritual.  This is a masterpiece, and among the two or three best films of the decade.",1240012800,2,1181,4.559241706161138
8013407,5,B0001JXP16,"Schlumpy Olivier (Olivier Gourmet) is a carpenter who works for a school, where he apprentices teen boys who have recently been released from juvenile detention.  He's a bit of a taskmaster and perhaps a bit harsh with the boys.  When he's asked to take on a new boy (Francis, played Morgan Marinne), he flatly refuses.  However, he is soon following the boy around and seems to know him somehow.  Who is this boy and what is the connection to Olivier?  The answer is slowly revealed through a serious of revelations.  Along the way, we get to know Olivier and his habits; he's meticulous and clearly overly controlled, which could lead to some problems.

""The Son"" is a superb but slowly paced film.  Belgian directors and brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (""L'Enfant"") rely on handheld digital cameras, which really works for this small story.  At times, it feels as though we're breathing down the characters' necks.  Although this character-driven drama could hardly be considered a ""thriller,"" it manages to really ratchet up the tension.  Specifically, Olivier is so internal and tightly wound that the audience has no idea how he will resolve his issues with this new boy.  The ending of the film is breath-taking, although the final denouement is perhaps not as cathartic as some might like.  The pace and lack of obvious resolution may turn off some viewers (as reflected by some of the reviews here), but I was mesmerized.  This ambiguous gem is a real winner.",1224806400,4,1474,4.891129032258065
