362443,5,630178541X,Alec Baldwin is at his best as he plays a psychopathic character in this fast paced action drama.

This movie is a cult classic, imo. Jennifer Lee is GREAT in this. She plays her character perfectly. Fred Ward is great as a run down older cop as well.

362736,4,630178541X,"Miami Blues takes the glamour out of Miami in the 1980's.  The film concerns the sociopath Freddy and his battle with a beat-up Miami Homicide cop named Hoke.  Thrown into the mix is Susie, a newbie hooker with nothing in the brains department who takes up with Freddy.  Freddy, played with unsettled insouciance by Alec Baldwin gives a riveting portrait of somebody with deep authority issues, little impulse control, and a bad history with foster homes and jail. Fred Ward imbues Hoke with a frustrated humanity that makes us like a cop who loses his false teeth, gun and badge to an attack by Freddy.  Jennifer Jason Lee, however, steals the film with her deceptively intuitive performance as Susie, especially as she convinces herself to first fall for Freddy, and then to let go.  She has some truly great lines in the film, especially at the end, when she is questioned by Hoke.  A lost classic, a gem, and one of my favorite films for it's lack of slickness, pretension and refusal to offer a happy ending where none is warranted.",1457654400,3,1037,4.701657458563536

362973,3,630178541X,"Guys shows up in FL and before getting out of the airport starts conning/robbing people. Unfortunately the first guy he roughed up died. So the police are casually but quite competently tracking him down. He meets up with a prostitute that he plays house with--literally rents a house and pretends that she is his wife. He ""goes to work"" which is him conning and robbing more people. He impersonates the police officer who is ""hot"" on his trail.

The movie is surprisingly ""intelligent"" in a way. I don't mean the people are intelligent. They are weird, quirky, ""dark comedic"", etc. But they are clever for a bunch of crazies. The movie is supposed to be gross . . . have a gross feel to it. You see this in the way the cop actor is supposed to have false teeth and is always taking them out and sucking on them when he has them in even though the actor if a very nice looking man. Etc. The prostitute is supposed to be a ""dumb blond"" like character before they were a dime a dozen in America although she was not blond.

Umm . . . that was really all there was in this movie. You get to see a ""good looking"" Alec Baldwin although I personally couldn't figure out if he was good looking or not. He looks good looking in certain poses/scenes but in others not so much. I always thought he had a big butt on him. And while he had a thick head of hair it is too thick. He is best looking when he has the wet look--it--his hair--is tame. But definitely contrast that to his appearance today. Startling.",1448582400,,1498,4.289752650176679

363056,5,630178541X,"George Armitage brings the to the screen the first in the late Charles Willeford's Hoke  Moseley crime thrillers in a grand style.  But before warned.  This film will either thrill you or disgust you.
""Miami Blues"" is very faithful to the novel of the same name.  The young Alec Baldwin is perfectly casted as the violent psychopath Freddy Frenger, Jr. or simply Junior.  No actor is more suitable to fill the role of Sgt. Hoke Moseley than Fred Ward (who also acted as one of the producers of the film.  And Jennifer Jason Leigh is also very good as another one of the frail women they she plays so well.
""Miami Blues"" centers around recently paroled nut job Junior arriving in Miami (set to the tune Spirit in the Sky which become the theme of the movie), setting up house keeping with innocent young hooker Susie but continuing his criminal ways.  As a result he runs afoul of uncouth Miami cop Moseley (in the opening scene Junior breaks the fingers of an annoying Hare Krishna leading to his death in a scene that is as funny to see as it is hard to watch).  Note: in the book this Hare Krishna is actually the brother of the hooker Susie that Junior later sets up house keeping.  While that fact is over looked in the screenplay it is typical to the approach the story telling takes.  As Junior and Moseley cross paths Junior beats the older cop nearly to death and then steals his badge, gun and his false teeth.  Now its up to the weaken Moseley to track down Junior, end his crime wave and most importantly recover his badge, gun and teeth.
I enjoyed this very violent and bloody black comedy so  much that after my first viewing I purchased the entire book series the next day and I am very happy to now add the DVD to my film collection.
Some might say that Armitage went a little too far with the violence and gore but that is all lifted directly from the books so if you have a hard time viewing films were faces are sewn back up and fingers are hacked off by meat cleavers than this is certainly not the film for you.",1388966400,2,2031,4.343915343915344
363057,4,630178541X,"Alec Baldwin was still trying to find his real strength as an actor.  that it would prove to be comedy would come as a surprise EXCEPT if you watch this movie to see an early attempt at a partially comedic role. ironically, he is not even supposed to be the star of it.  Fred Ward is as Hoke Mosley, a Miami policeman penned in a series of books by old hand Charles Willeford.  I read the book first and it was one of the funniest books I've ever read.  I would give the book five stars. The movie gets four stars because Baldwin has to carry the whole movie. Fred Ward is only partially successful as Hoke and certainly no one would take him for the film's lead even though he is billed as such.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a prostitute who briefly becomes Baldwin's girlfriend.  She is ok but the role itself is tiresome. Baldwin is a California con who comes to Miami straight from his release from prison. he is definitely off his rocker. he alternates between committing crimes and solving the crimes that Hoke can't. my recommendation is to read the book and then watch the movie for Baldwin's performance.

Not only is this movie cool, sexy, and fun, but all the principle characters (Baldwin, Jennifer Jason-Leigh, and Fred Ward) really seem to be enjoying themselves and are absolutely excellent in their roles.  It's the perfect ensemble piece that serves as both escapist entertainment fare and dark social comedy--a commentary on the American Dream won and lost. Baldwin is perfectly cast as the quick-tempered, sexy bad-boy who strongly hints at being possibly bi-sexual--the result of having been a ""top"" in prison (though the film never specifically confirms that). But just check out the initial sexual encounter between him and the boyish-looking Jennifer Jason-Leigh, then draw your own conclusion. This is a largely under-appreciated indie film with two attractive leads that would go on to individual fame, which begs the question: how could a movie this good have escaped any oscar consideration?",1381017600,2,1080,5.119318181818182

Like `Married to the Mob', it doesn't always work, but the acting certainly carries the film in some weaker spots.  This time it is the men who carry the bulk of the film; most notably Alec Baldwin.  Baldwin is every bit a caricature here, but the kind that seems appropriate.  He is funny and sickly charming in his cartoonish ways, but he is also quite convincing as a psychotic killer as well, so he balances out quite nicely.  Fred Ward is quite good as the cop bent on capturing Baldwin's `Christian Killer', but it is Jennifer Jason Leigh and her ridiculous accent that drag down parts of this film.  She is truly insufferable here, and it's surprising to me that this year (and this film) was seen as a big breakout for her when just two years later she stunned with her mesmerizing turn in `Single White Female'.  Here she fails.  The film itself has its highs, but it also has some lows (like that interlude in the middle that portrays the `happy couple' living their lives over sappy music).  Like `Married to the Mob', it's an uneven film, but Baldwin and Ward are a match made in heaven and they really work enough magic to justify sticking around till the closing credits.",1315526400,,1290,4.478632478632479

Baldwin is as crooked as they come, but uses the badge and gun he steals from Ward to ""play cop"", busting some perps even as he steals from both them and their victims. At the same time he is ""playing house"" with Leigh, a naive prostitute who thinks Baldwin is looking to settle down. As Ward closes in and Leigh starts to realize that she is sharing a bed with a bad guy, she coyly serves him up a slice of overly strong ""vinegar pie"" in order to see just how far he'll go to lie. Unfortunately, it also ends up end up being one of somebody's last meals as all the deceptions start to fall apart.

363106,5,630178541X,An early Alec Baldwin movie and for my money (Glen Garry Glen Ross Cameo aside) his best to date. He plays an ex con who uses a stolen detectives ID and gun to pull off heists in pursuit of his own short cut version to the American dream. Solid supporting cast especially his trusting/naive girlfriend whom he takes along for the ride and the lugubrious detective played by the underrated Fred Ward who is trying to catch up with him. Catchy opening music score and an authentic B movie classic street feel to the Miami scenery throughout. Saw it several times on early HBO a thousand years ago so I cant comment on the present DVD format. A good movie though and well worth a look for Alec Baldwin fans.

The three main characters in here are all low-life scumbags but interesting and definitely fun to watch. Alec Baldwin plays a psycho thug and exhibits a good flair for comedy, which he has pursed several times in movies after this one. He's also a legitimate tough guy, or at least sounds like one. Jennifer Jason Leigh, perhaps the all-time female sleazoid in movies, is a lame-brained prostitute. I was very impressed with her southern accent. Fred Ward is a strange cop in pursuit, one who has problems with his false teeth!

balwin accidentally kills a religious nut at the airport when he violently breaks his finger (the guy dies of shock) and he immediately sweeps a young dingbat (jennifer jason leigh), who's a wannabe call girl, off her feet.

a grizzled, jaded cop (fred ward) gets on his case and starts putting heat on baldwin. baldwin winds up going to ward's home and jumps him, beating him badly, stealing his gun, badge...and even his false teeth! then baldwin goes around playing ""cop""- he winds up robbing people who rob people, like robin hood...'cept he doesn't give the money to the poor people. there are some outrageously funny scenes as baldwin goes hog wild with his newfound power of posing as a cop.

3 brilliant performances by baldwin, ward and leigh with tons of incredible dark humor. even the minor roles are extremely well done. this movie is more of a cult classic but i can't recommend it highly enough. after many, many years, it's now out on dvd. if you look around, you should be able to find it for $10. my only complaint is that i WISH baldwin and ward (and even leigh) had done commentary as a dvd bonus/extra.",1210204800,3,1556,4.56989247311828

Alec Baldwin displays the marks of genius here, over the top, beyond the fringes of insanity and then he pulls back from sociopath to sweet, chummy boyfriend to his thespian equal, Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays the dim-witted,sweet girlfriend forever to endearing believability. A twist on the Bonnie and Clyde matchup,as this Bonnie, Leigh never catches on to the pathological insanity of her boyfriend. Baldwin, the serial killer, is dogged by a careless detective,Fred Ward, who also brings a bag of acting chops. Baldwin takes on other alter egos as required, even impersonates a cop, to mock the men in blue further as they draw the net in. When Baldwin slips out of his hideout to kill and return unaware of anything out of the ordinary, projecting innocence, you know you are in for a ride. The whole range of crazy, offbeat characters that fill an Elmore Leonard pulp get their proper due in this suspenseful, climactic look at insane homicide or normal domesticity in a single moment.

363240,5,630178541X,"This  film, along with David Lynch's 'Wild At Heart' , should be credited, or faulted, with sparking the shift in American independent cinema, and art films in general, from sex to violence.  All the elements that made 'Reservoir Dogs', and its legions of imitators, so successful a few years later, can be found here.  Alec Baldwin gives one of his best performances in this little-seen, underrated film based on the novel of the same name by Charles Willeford.  Baldwin plays a dumb, small-time con man recently released from prison who takes off to Miami to work new territory.  Once there, he meets a dim-witted hooker, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and proceeds to use her as he continues to pull off small time heists and petty thefts to get ahead.  Part of Baldwin's brilliance is that he gets to put his woefully underutilized comedic talents to work here (anybody who's seen his genius at work on the three times he's hosted 'Saturday Night Live' will know what I'm talking about.)  The film is a brilliant blend of black humour, violent slapstick and just palin ol' oddball weirdness.  I think it got filmed in the late 80s and didn't find a distributor till about 1990.  The Miami setting is used perfectly, as a tacky backdrop to Baldwin's minor scams.  Everything about this film is a bit off, and it all blends together brilliantly.  Fred Ward plays Hoke Moseley, an aging cop who is put on Baldwin's trail after Baldwin breaks an annoying Hare Krishna's finger at the airport, who then dies from shock.  From there its a series of strange scenarios set into motion, enhanced by the bizarre Florida settings (restaurants with synchronized swimmers, pastel-coloured hotel rooms, pawn shops with shotgun-toting bodygaurds) screwy characters and Alec Baldwin's collection of ridiculous looking stolen clothes (ugly cable knit sweaters, shiny running shorts and pink plaid golf pants).  I can't begin to describe the many strange circumstances that culminate into scenes because so many of them are memorable...Baldwin pointing an Uzi at a toy store clerk who then asks for a price check, Baldwin holding up drug dealers with said toy gun and then finding out later in his hotel room that he's just stolen a million BRAZILIAN dollars.  From there he launches into a hilarious Scarface impression.  There's one fabulous part where he tries to stop a convenience store hold up with a jar of spaghetti sauce, only to get run over and have his eyebrow ripped off.  Or when Fred Ward comes over for dinner, only to be stalked by Baldwin later, who steals his badge, gun and false teeth.  Baldwin then goes on a crazy stealing spree, catching drug dealers and taking off with their booty, or shooting a robber at a bar before yelling 'Stop or I'll shoot!'.  Another great scene is watching Baldwin get his fingers chopped off during a botched pawn shop robbery, and then witnessing him scoop up his severed digits along with the loot. You have to see this movie several times to appreciate it.  It's absolutely hilarious.  I've been quoting lines from the film for years, especially Baldwin's cruelly blunt lines.  (One favourite: after getting his eyebrow sowed on by a widowed neighbour, he tells her ''I'll bet your husband was glad to die.'')  The whole movie has the feel of a really bad Miami Vice rip-off, but it works to its advantage, painting Miami as this hopelessly gaudy town, rivalled only by Las Vegas in raw bad taste.  I like how it shows the flipside of the glitzy, seedy glamour of Michael Mann's famous TV show.  This is a more interesting look at Florida's grimy underbelly, filled with small time hoods, racketeers and crooked vice cops.  George Armitage does a great job bringing Willeford's quirky characters and decidedly unconventional  plot developments to life on screen.  Both Baldwin and Ward are brilliant and Leigh does a good job too.  There's so many great parts to this film I think I'd rather leave it to all of you to catch it sometime.  The book is just as good and features three more stories in the series of Hoke Moseley detective tales.",1091491200,6,4084,4.835971223021582
363241,5,630178541X,"I have always said you take your chances when you rent an Alec Baldwin film. You just never know what you're going to see with this actor since most of his work is decidedly sub par. If you spent any time agonizing over ""The Getaway,"" ""She's Having a Baby,"" or ""The Juror"" you know exactly what I mean. Moreover, because Alec attained success after starting his career some two decades ago, we now must suffer interminably the presence of his untalented brothers Stephen, William, and Daniel. I could go on and on about the Baldwin brothers. Alec's political views, for example, achieve epic levels of obnoxious ignorance. He's in the running-along with Janeane Garofalo, Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon, and Martin Sheen-for the limousine liberal award of the decade. Yes sir, Alec Baldwin presents a host of problems for the discerning filmgoer. But, and this is a big but, you will find a few gems in the man's filmography if you can bend your mind around Alec's innumerable problems. Who can forget his memorable, scene stealing appearance in ""Glengarry Glen Ross""? And he stole the show from folks like Jack Lemmon, no easy feat. This film, ""Miami Blues,"" ranks as one of Alec Baldwin's best roles; it's a wonderfully entertaining film that should receive more attention than it has presently received.

 Based on a Charles Willeford novel, ""Miami Blues"" introduces us to Frederick J. Frenger, Jr. (Baldwin, of course), an incorrigible miscreant recently released from a lengthy stint in the stir. Right from the start we learn Frenger's not about to play it straight. In the lobby of the airport, our man inadvertently kills a Hare Krishna. Definitely not a good thing, let alone a smart thing, to do. The incident forces Frenger to flee from the scene before Sergeant Hoke Moseley (Fred Ward) and Sergeant Bill Henderson (Charles Napier) arrive to begin the tedious task of starting an investigation. In the meantime, Frenger holes up in a fancy hotel where he proceeds to launch a series of small capers aimed at providing him with a false identity and spending money. He'll steal suitcases, rob and beat people, do anything if he thinks he can get something out of it. Frenger even robs a bunch of drug dealers with a water gun in a brazen daylight operation that would be idiotic if he didn't pull it off so coolly. It soon becomes apparent that something just isn't right with our heroic Frederick Frenger; he is, in fact, a sociopathic personality with an astonishing capacity to lie, cheat, and steal.

 Frenger meets the girl of his dreams when he acquires the services of Pepper, aka Susan Waggoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a not so bright harridan, for an evening of rest and relaxation. The two form a weird, love/hate bond that leads to a most unusual relationship. Waggoner expects her new man to play the marriage game-she has no idea who he really is, of course-but Frenger has other plans. When Hoke Moseley manages to track Baldwin's character down, Freddie sneaks into the cop's hovel and steals his badge and gun. The rest of the movie sees the criminal playing cop while he engages in a series of increasingly dangerous crimes. He shoots a robber in the leg at a restaurant, catches a mugger only to steal the woman's purse for himself, and attempts to foil a robbery at the local convenience store. In the interim, he verbally abuses Susan and toys with the determined Hoke. Frenger pulls off so many jobs that nearly every cop in the city is looking for him, most of all Hoke Moseley. The denouement of ""Miami Blues"" details the gruesome fall of Frederick Frenger, Jr. as an attempted robbery at a pawnshop goes horribly awry.

 The performances in ""Miami Blues"" elevate the film above your standard cops and robbers picture. Baldwin is wonderful as the unhinged Frenger. He jaunts around town sporting a severe crew cut, several tattoos, and a look in his eye that made me want to run the other way. Submerging himself totally in the character of a dangerous personality, Baldwin's fluctuations between pithy, grinning liar and ultra violent sociopath are sudden and shocking. Jennifer Jason Leigh, a personal favorite of mine, turns in a solid performance as the dense Susan Waggoner. She's such a mental midget, in fact, that she doesn't recognize her boyfriend's true personality despite the abundance of evidence in front of her face until well into the film. The real award here goes to the always reliable Fred Ward as the alcoholic, cynical cop Hoke Moseley. Ward has never been as much fun to watch as he is in ""Miami Blues."" A recurring subplot of the film involves Moseley's dentures, which Frenger steals when he roughs up the sergeant. The best scene in the film involves the cop dining with the hapless Susan and Fred in their little house, a scene that is rightfully a masterpiece of magnificent acting.

 If there are any faults with ""Miami Blues,"" it is in deciding exactly what genre the film falls in. Is this a black comedy? A cops and robbers film? A romance picture? Well, it is all of them rolled up into one. A further surprise involves the 'PG-13' rating for the film. I can't imagine how the MPAA let this one slide through without a 'R' with all the bloody violence, nudity, and adult situations unfolding every other minute. Regrettably, the DVD version of the film contains no extras. What a shame; I would have liked to listen to a commentary track with Baldwin, Leigh, and Ward.

363245,5,630178541X,"Never writing a review of one of my favorite movies is a major oversight on my part. ""Miami Blues,"" adapted from a book by Charles Willeford, is a movie which has great impact. Alec Baldwin portrays Frederic Frenger Jr. (aka ""Junior""), a man whose middle name should be ""Trouble."" He is a person capable of anything at any time. Arriving in Florida after his release from prison, Frenger instantly starts up with his modus operandi. Forging some documents in order to attain someone else's identity (the drugged Herman Gottlieb), he walks through the airport and is confronted by a Hari Krishni member; without hesitation, Junior breaks one of the man's fingers. The man dies. This sets up the plot. Frenger is now wanted for homicide. We are introduced to Hoke Mosely, a nicely drawn character. He's a career cop out to get to the bottom of the Hari Krishna's demise. He's told someone with a ""suede sportcoat"" was the culprit -- this is Junior in Herman Gottlieb's clothing.
We find Junior shacked up in a seedy hotel, where he hooks up with Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, Susie. She's a simple gal from Florida who is working her way through college engaged in the ""oldest profession."" They take to each other instantly and decide to move in together. As a newly formed couple, the dialogue between the conniving psychopath and the honest prostitute with a heart of gold is hilarious as they talk about their future ... with Mosely hot on the trail.
Won't give anymore details except to say this movie will not disappoint. Solid performances of well-drawn characters. Alec Baldwin, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Fred Ward (as Sgt. Hoke Mosely) are exceptional. Look for Paul Gleason (of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Trading Places"") as a crooked cop. As usual, his trademark style and character are very entertaining.

363248,4,630178541X,"This movie managed to stay under almost everyone's radar screen, and this is truly a shame.  This is a quirky, unorthodox, and unpredictable film with potent acting and a very intriguing story.  It's a compelling and intelligent film that is very funny and yet quite sad.  The movie came and went before Alec Baldwin emerged as a (sometimes) legitimate star.  And he's really at his best, acting opposite Jennifer Jason Leigh, who delivers one of her trademark credible and powerful performances.  Alec Baldwin portrays an ex-con who has just been released from a prison in Florida, and it doesn't take long before he's returning to his criminal ways. Early in the film Alec intentionally breaks the thumb of a Harry Krishna follower at the airport, who proceeds to die as a result of the trama.  At this point, a detective (aptly and humorously portrayed by Fred Ward) begins investigating and pursuing Baldwin.  Ward doesn't have enough evidence to arrest Baldwin, but he is pretty certain he's got the right man.  An interesting and funny cat-and-mouse game follows.  Baldwin makes his living by stealing from other criminals, mostly by robbing muggers just after they have robbed someone.  Midway through the film Baldwin obtains a detective's badge and proceeds to impersonate a police officer, which allows him to more easily apply his trade and opens the way for several hysterical scenes.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a prostitute who, after a tryst with Baldwin, ends up falling in love and living with him.  The dynamic between these two characters occupies a central role in this film, and it is both convincing and interesting.  As the film progresses, it becomes obvious that Baldwin is battling himself and facing large changes and challenges within himself.  While continuing to impersonate a police officer while robbing people, it becomes obvious that he begins to internalize the persona and seems to think of himself as a protector of others.  While this film is frequently violent, comic and funny, it is tinged with a very serious edge that meanders into areas of human longing, sadness and loss.  This film unfolds slowly, but is compelling and funny every step of the way.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is poignant and provides emotional ballast, but Baldwin's performance borders on being gut-wrenchingly good.  The heaviness and self-consciousness that often accompany his later performances are nowhere to be found.  This film is daring, orginal and intelligent...and a lot of fun along with way.  Hopefully the new DVD edition will allow it to surface on radar screen's everywhere.",1037232000,30,2613,5.132387706855792
363249,5,630178541X,"Alec Baldwin shines as ""Junior"" in this offbeat, quirky, action/crime/comedy adventure.  That sounds like an odd combination, and it is just that unique combination that really makes this film work.

 The fun begins when ""Junior"", a career criminal, is on the loose in Miami, hence the title.  After stepping off a plane, and breaking the finger of a Hare Krishna at the airport who later dies of shock, Sgt. Hoke Mosley (Fred Ward) is on the case.

 Meanwhile, Junior is going about his business of robbing, assaulting, and assuming the identity of ""Herman Gotlieb"".  That is funny all by itself, but that's the wallet lifted, so that's who Junior is.  He is living in a cheap hotel where the bellboy is a pimp.  So, when Junior wants a lady for ""entertainment"" he gets a roomservice prostitute, enter Jennifer Jason Leigh as ""Susie"",  a not too bright, but sweet girl who is ""working"" the hotel.  Once she is sent to Juniors room, they remain together as a couple.  Blissfully ignorant,  Susie naively trusts Junior, and plays the role of dutiful wife, oblivious to his frighteningly deviate behavior.  Everyone is happy, until..........

 Trouble starts for Junior as Sgt. Hoke Mosley, a denture toting vice veteran who lives up to his hokey name, closes in.  Particularly amusing is a  shared dinner at Junior and Susies place, where Mosley lets Junior know, he's a suspect for the airport Hare Krishna death incident.  Fred Ward is very amusing in this role, and repugnant as well. Looking at him makes you think you can smell him right through the screen.  He drinks up all the beer, eats all the food, and exits after asking Junior if he'd mind taking a look at a line-up, and standing in it too.  Junior knows it's time to make a serious move, or it's back to jail.

 Although George Armitage is the director of this film, the entire cinematography, mood. music, quirky camera angles, and cast spells Jonathan Demme all the way.  He is the credited  producer of this film, but I imagine he certainly had alot to do with the directing and casting as well.  You can see all Demme favorites here in small cameo roles, as in his previous ""Married To The Mob"", and ""Something Wild"" (see my reviews).  Charles Napier, a welcome Demme mainstay, is in a peripheral role here as a collegue of Wards' Mosley, but he's just one of many familiar faces that show up unexpectedly throughout the film.

 ""Miami Blues"" is a unique blend of comedy, and action crime thriller that will get your attention with it's visual flash, and hold your interest with its well paced plot and odd characters.  It's a forgotten sleeper that should not be missed.",1032912000,12,2639,4.723684210526316

The scene where the JJLeigh character asks the Baldwin character to promise her something is the best 30 seconds of acting ever.  The facial expressions say it all.",1524441600,,328,5.132075471698113
