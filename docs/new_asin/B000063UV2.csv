8698936,5,B000063UV2,"A YANK IN THE R.A.F. is one of my favorite WWII films. There is a look and feel of innocence and optimism about it for what really lay ahead. This 1941 film made during the War takes a somewhat lighthearted approach, yet under all the gloss and antics there are some grim realities. Leon Shamroy's cinematography is stunning and dramatic especially as the film progresses into its later stages encountering the enemy in the field. His use of light and shadow is extraordinary. Tyrone Power as Tim Baker, the Yank, gives a likeable performance full of confidence and optimism. Reginald Gardiner as Pillby uses his usual charm to enhance this early WWII film. I thought Henry King's direction was excellent. Art Directors James Basevi and Richard Day with Thomas Little's Set Decorations give this film a look of authenticity that I think has been overlooked. This is more than just a lighthearted adventure film. The Special Effects by Fred Sersen and Louis J. Witte  are excellent, especially during the Dunkirk sequence.",1427155200,,1021,4.970760233918129
