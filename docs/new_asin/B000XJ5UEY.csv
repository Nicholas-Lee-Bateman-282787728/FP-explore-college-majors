3002521,5,B000XJ5UEY,"Some critics panned this movie when it was first vetted. I say that they  are simply jaded and completely misguided in evaluating what we like about being entertained. Being entertained is a simple proposition and this movie easily accomplishes that promise. Dad needs to feel that his son loves and respects him - a difficult enough proposition in today's world. of crazy influences. Among other things that make this movie so enjoyable is the obvious enjoyment of the actors for working with each other. The movie draws you in like an old friend, with, of course, a fittingly touching ending. A great movie for a cozy night/rainy day with the fire burning ...",1202947200,10,661,4.849557522123894

There's nothing new here in terms of a story of a father who proves to himself that he can accomplish things and be a good dad because he really is a good person. Just a really good movie.",1202601600,10,350,4.161764705882353
3002523,5,B000XJ5UEY,"I loved ""The Amateurs"" - saw it at a festival. This gem is about friends trying to do something that gives meaning to their lives - it just happens to be that they decide to make an adult film using the town's talent! The cast is great - Jeff Bridges is a wonderful actor and his interpretation of Andy Sargentee - a mis-guided man with a heart of gold - drives this sweet story. Michael Traeger (writer/director) saves some of his funniest lines for Ted Danson, Bill Fichtner and Joe Pantoliano. And, ""The Amateurs"" is also a clever parody of America's mainstreet fascination of an alleged taboo. I can't believe this did not come out in my town and I can not wait for this DVD.",1202342400,8,679,4.396825396825397

3002541,5,B000XJ5UEY,"If you want to recommend this movie to someone you have to avoid giving a plot summary - completely. It sounds prurient and dodgy. It is none of the above! Full of great lines and a kind of quirky innocence that shines through even when the subject matter could be presented in a hard core/harsh way. The balance always leans toward heart, community, and caring even when the easy way to write it would have been to go for the cheap gross laugh. This is simply the funniest, sweetest, and most heartfelt movie you will ever watch about a whole town making a porno movie as a community project.",1426636800,,593,4.4495412844036695

3002550,4,B000XJ5UEY,"A terrific ensemble cast, known faces in unlikely roles -- Tim Blake Nelson as the romantic success, for instance.  Ultimately a delightful buddy movie with a plot twist that makes one smile.  My favorite bit -- a small and memorable appearance by Eileen Brennan.  The general response when the movie came out was unenthusiastic.  This is not an 'important' film and yes, it depends heavily on some sterotyping which makes one wince a bit, but I considered those non-PC responses to be a part of the general cluelessness of this group of characters. Recommended but a caution about coarse language -- if you can't 'hear' past conversation laced with cursing, then you won't make it through the movie.",1406160000,,700,4.906779661016949

It's a clever, wry, sane script that takes a group of plausible friends through a strange journey to a happy ending.

I won't spoil the plot twists. Just see this. This is one to own. Jeff Bridges at his low key, laid back best.

3002563,5,B000XJ5UEY,"I have to say that this movie is so funny. I didn't know what I was getting into when I bought it, but I'm so glad I did. The names of the characters is hilarious. I laughed right from the beginning. Well worth the price.",1362614400,2,221,3.933333333333333
3002564,4,B000XJ5UEY,"This is an indy type flick sporting an ""A"" type cast. It all comes together in a satisfying, albeit quiet, fashion.

Here's the scoop. Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) just cannot seem to connect. He can't see eye to eye with a nine to five type gig. He's divorced but not because they had horrible problems. She simply got tired of watching him miss the target. She is now married to a really rich guy and has custody of their son who loves his dad more than his new, rich surroundings. Andy has hosted a series of failed business  ventures with his buddies and other residents of their really small town. He now has the mega idea for him and his buds to go in on making a porn movie. A few of the group know just enough to get it started, but their inexperience proves to be nearly insurmountable.

This is a good-hearted film which is more than underlined with the final song. Though more motivated, Bridges' character is a short putt from ""The Big Lebowski."" What is going on here is the idea of friendship and acceptance. None of these guys is a success by normal, Western, capitalist standards. And though they've been burnt by past Bridges' failed ideas they still get on board with the new one. The rub here is that these are genuinely decent guys trying to do something that isn't suited to them. Making a porn film demands a more calloused set of sensibilities. They don't even feel comfortable watching the action they are filming. So of course it is doomed to fail. But in that failure emerges their greater triumph and makes them closer than they were in the beginning.

The cast is great and all do a good job. These actors must have all worked for less than their standard rate because this is a modestly budgeted outing that I cannot imagine would normally support them. But they all work well together and you're pulling for them in the end. Though modest, it's directed, shot and cut as good as it needed to be. Comparisons to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" have been made. Those comparisons are warranted but obviously for the heart and not the content. If you like a feel-good flick that isn't sappy, this is for you.",1353283200,,2127,4.5025906735751295
3002565,3,B000XJ5UEY,"a good li'l low budget comedy; rent it, don't buy it! i need some more words in this part, so the woman that Tim Blake Nelson likes in this movie is lovely!",1337990400,2,156,3.90625
3002566,5,B000XJ5UEY,"This film is about what happens when people set out to do one thing & end up someplace completely different. It isn't a sex farce at all, it's about people & what happens when they start out to do something together & being together takes over.  There's some great fun in this film & lots of wonderful revelations as each character gets his or her moment to shine.  It's not an amazing movie, but it does have it's moments.",1332201600,,423,4.341772151898734
3002567,5,B000XJ5UEY,"Don't listen to all those other reviews. I saw this movie on Netflix and went straight over to Amazon because I had to own it. I have never even heard of this movie and just felt like watching a feel good kind of movie because I was feeling a little depressed about life. When the movie was over I felt much better. The first song playing with the credits is a song called ""A Good Man"" by King Straggler. That song kind of hit home for me. So, if you are looking for kind of a feel good kind of movie, and if your short, bald, unemployed, divorced, and living back at home with your mom like I am, I would highly suggest buying this. It will make you feel good about things.",1317081600,4,674,4.075187969924812
3002568,1,B000XJ5UEY,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen!!!!  Horrific production, terrible quality, terrible actors and a terrible script.  Surprised this movie made it to DVD.  I am amazed that ANYBODY liked this movie!!!!

This is a very slow movie and long movie.  The plot is very simplistic; an ordinary man who lives in a small town is determined to make a porno that will make it big and have a great payout.  However, when you watch the movie it will seem that it's a lot of no name actors in a low budget movie where not much happens.  There's no action, really no special effects and no strong humor, maybe some very seldom dumb humor.

I am a big movie collector; if it looks good I'll buy it.  In this case, it's a movie that seems to have a relatively good trailer, but it's one of those movies where after you watch it, you find that the trailer consists of the only good parts of the movie (about 30 seconds worth of material).  Of the hundreds of movie I have, this is in the bottom five (not even bottom 10) worst movies I've seen/own.  After having a terrible movie marathon with a friend who was determined beyond a doubt that he had the worst movie (Mars Attacks), even he agreed that this movie was worse.  We couldn't even make it through the whole movie, it was that bad; it was too slow and painfully unwatchable.  After having watched the whole movie myself, I was fine putting this movie away after the first half.  So after a second opinion, the movie's terrible!  Buy Mars Attacks instead, you'll be able to make it through that movie much more easily and there's more humor in that.",1309651200,,1596,4.380952380952381
3002569,3,B000XJ5UEY,"Actually, 2.5 stars. Taking the conceit of Waiting for Guffman a little further, The Amateurs follows the misadventures of a troop of small-town losers as they take a shot at fame and fortune--by making a do-it-yourself porno film. The cast is terrific--Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson, Glenne Headly, Joe Pantoliano etc. And the group's fumbling, embarrassed efforts to recruit amateur porno actors--and film them--are oddly sweet and affecting. Of course, things go hilariously wrong at the end, but the day is saved (in a way that was predictable 20 minutes into the film). And here the movie goes entirely off the tracks with its unbelievable Hollywood ending. It would be one thing if the amateur pornographers had gotten a hint of success at the end--a spot of hope and pride. But the excessive money and success they receive shows how little the writer respected everything else about the movie that was good.",1301788800,,909,5.026490066225166
3002570,4,B000XJ5UEY,"This is one of those small, quiet, warm, funny movies that surprises you so much you may never forget it. The acting is great, of course, and Jeff Bridges and Ted Danson and the rest of the cast all seem to have agreed that they would have at least as much fun as anyone watching the movie.",1293494400,2,290,4.105263157894737
3002571,5,B000XJ5UEY,"Lots of other reviews here tell the general story so I just want to say that this film is a sweet, touching story of a chronic loser who, regardless of his track record, is loved by his friends & neighbors. Jeff Bridges has said it is the porn movie Frank Capra would have made if he had ever made one, and if that makes you want to scream ""Blasphemy!"" and hyperventilate, just take a deep breath, relax, and watch this little film. It could change your mind.",1289865600,2,459,4.287356321839081
3002572,5,B000XJ5UEY,lots of good actors in this and a great story.  just stick with it.  I would like to live there and be with them.,1276905600,2,113,3.6666666666666665
3002573,4,B000XJ5UEY,"Though it is listed in IMDB as The Moguls, the title was changed to The Amateurs. One title was meant to be ironic and the other is sincere. I think sincere is the way to go, for The Amateurs is nothing if not sincere. Though the subject could be sleazy, it is handled so sweetly--it is the story of an unemployed but sincere man (Jeff Bridges) who inspires his friends in a small town to pull together and against all odds make a movie. A dirty movie.

The Dude Abides

Bridges will always be known as The Dude from The Big Lebowski, regardless of what other roles he plays. Cast as the President of the United States, he was heard to remark, ""so, The Dude gets to be President."" Now that he has won the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Country Singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart, The Dude has finally received some recognition. In The Amateurs, made just before his Oscar win, he has created another great character--he may be an unemployed incompetent, but he has a big heart.

Jeff Bridges was finally persuaded to do this project because of the writing. Michael Traeger wrote the script and directed. He was a first time director, but Bridges has had good luck with first time writer/directors because they have usually spent a lot of time thinking about the movie while writing the script, and by the time they get to direct, they have a very good idea of what they're looking for.

There is a character in The Amateurs who also wants to be a Writer/Director. He is called Some Idiot. ""Some"" for short. The film within a film was written and directed by ""Some Idiot"" and his directing chair is inscribed ""Some Idiot."" Some Idiot is played by veteran character actor Joe Pantoliano. You might have noticed him in Daredevil, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, The Matrix, Bound, Midnight Run, The Goonies, or Risky Business. He suffers from depression and has written a book and has a web site devoted to helping others with similar issues.

Ted Danson plays Moose, who pretends to be a mucho macho he man but is gay. He doesn't really fool anyone. Ted Danson will always be known as Sam Malone, the former ballplayer and current womanizer/bar owner from ""Cheers."" Or ""Becker,"" or the guy on ""Ink,"" or most likely, the guy who was dating Whoopie Goldberg and thought it would be funny to show up with her at a Roast in Blackface and make watermelon jokes. One of his fondest ambitions was to do the same sort of over the top characterization of a gay character. In the context of The Amateurs this is very sweet, because his friends still accept him; in fact they have known all along.

Patrick Fugit is best known for playing the young Rolling Stone writer in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous. In Amateurs he plays a film buff that works in a video store and is hired to run the camera. He is also shooting video footage. It is a quiet, nuanced performance. He blends in with his surroundings, and you don't even notice that he's filming everything.

Timothy Blake Nelson plays Barney Macklehatton, and in the context of The Amateurs, it is one of the more normal roles. He is the romantic lead who might even get the girl. He usually is cast as a freakish misfit of some kind, such as his role in O, Brother, Where Art Thou? It was a rare opportunity for him, and he relished the chance. Plus, he got to work with Jeff Bridges who is after all, The Dude.

William Fichtner is another veteran character actor who was in numerous films that are well known to the film going public: The Dark Knight, The Chumscrubber, Crash, Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor, The Perfect Storm, Armageddon, Albino Alligator, Strange Days, Quiz Show, and Malcolm X. Otis, the character he plays, is very enthusiastic about the project but everyone is being asked to put up $2,000 and his assets lack the necessary liquidity:

----------
Otis: I'm in. Except for no money, it's a no-brainer for me. First off, making a stag film *has* to be a good time. Number two, my hat's off to you. Good job. We can do this. Wha-what are we talking about here? Making a dirty movie - film, whatever, whatever. What does that require? Pointing a camera at a he and a she... he'in and a-she'in.
==================

He just wants to stand around and watch everything. Is there a job like that? Turns out there is, and he is made an executive producer.
Now, they just need talent and some of the actors and actresses in the film within a film are Isaiah Washington who was not the bartender on ""The Love Boat"" but was Dr. Preston Burke on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" the guy who was forced to publicly apologize for insensitive remarks and then fired; Judy Greer, who played Judith's snarky but sexy sister Myra on ""Two and a Half Men;"" Valerie Perrine, from Can't Stop the Music with The Village People; and Glenne Headly, who played Tess Trueheart in Dick Tracy.

Other cast members of note are Jeanne Tripplehorn, who played Jackie O. on Grey Gardens, as well as being in *Waterworld* and *Basic Instinct*; Lauren Graham, Lorelai Gilmore of ""The Gilmore Girls"" and currently Sarah Braverman on ""Parenthood;"" Steven Weber, who was Brian Michael Hackett on ""Wings;"" and Brad Garrett who was Robert Barone on ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Though the rest of the cast of The Amateurs were less well known, and in fact may have actually been amateurs, they also provided strong contributions to the success of the project.

The Bottom Line is The Amateurs is a very likeable indie film about making a film. For a film about making a dirty movie it is surprisingly sweet. Along with the amateurs, there is some very big talent, like Oscar winning actor Jeff Bridges -- The Dude. He pulls the whole thing together.

------------
Otis: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Andy Sargentee: I don't do, Ok, I try. And I'm trying to make a por no because it's something I might be able to do. Because it's killing me I haven't done anything. You know, people who do, they have extra time, not us trying people, we're busy trying all the time. Nothing takes up more time than trying.

Believe it or not, family values are ultimately well-represented. Overall this is quite an uplifting film and I'm comfortable with recommending it to all my family.",1269043200,2,306,5.14
3002575,1,B000XJ5UEY,"A word to the wise - avoid all films from First Look Entertainment. Cheaply filmed,
terribly written. With a cast like this it should've been a brilliant comedy. It is not. What we get is good actors sleep-walking through the script. Just awlful.
Visually, it looks like they use videotape, you know, where you get 4 blank tapes for the price of 3.
As far as the story goes, they keep talking about ""the town"" getting involved with making the movie. All you see are the same 6 morons. It's hard to enjoy a movie when you don't feel empathy for any of the actors. Bridges deserved all the bad stuff that happened to him.",1266364800,,619,4.391304347826087
3002576,3,B000XJ5UEY,"I'll admit something. If this hadn't come on tv & there hadn't been anything else to watch or do, I probably wouldn't have watched this movie. I do enjoy Jeff Bridges, but some of his stuff is hit & miss. Plus it's hard to watch him now & not compare his every non-villain role to his character of Lebowski. After watching this film, I'm glad I watched it. It's really very cute & will get overlooked by many.

The film follows a group of friends who decide to make a porno. Leading the group is Andy, a guy who has given up on a lot in his life, including his marriage. Along for the ride are a group of guys that include a man who goes by the name of ""Some Guy"" as well as a young man who records just about everything he sees. They all agree to help for their own personal reasons, some of which are obvious & others which develop slowly throughout the film.

Honestly, this movie was cute. It's not something I'd rush out & buy, but it is something I'd recommend a friend to watch at some point in time. The characters are nice, but at the same time they didn't really reach out to me all that much. As the saying goes, ""it's not quite milk, but not yet a shake"". The film is better than many indie films I've seen, but it just seems to lack some sort of ""oomph"" that would've pushed it along & made it stand out more than some of the other films out there.

This film will be a must have for fans of Bridges, but for the rest of us... just rent it for right now. If you then decide that you just have to have it, go ahead & buy it.",1259452800,,1536,4.0130718954248366

it's a movie about friends,
it's a movie about really big ideas,
it's a movie about Jello with little pieces of fruit in it,
it's a movie about success!!

Jeff Bridges stars as Andy Sargentee, a driven man with no direction, a kind-hearted man who doesn't always know what to do, resulting in the loss of numerous jobs and his marriage.
After long hours of hard thinking, he comes up with a brilliant idea- let's make a porno film and make a million bucks!!  He enlists the help of his good buddies and some townfolk, they set out to find actors, write scenes, and get the movie made.  Hilarity ensues...
There is a great cast in this movie playing great characters that you can't help but get attached to, despite their quirkiness.
Although it is a movie about people making a porno, it is refreshingly wholesome.  And a happy ending to boot!!

I guess the moral of the story is: Sex sells, but having a big heart will bring you real success!!

This is a feel good movie with some awesomely entertaining scenes that I highly recommend!!",1247184000,3,1086,4.51530612244898
3002578,5,B000XJ5UEY,"I have to say that I agree with VERY little in Sam Graham's ""official"" review of this movie.  I was taken with the fact that the movie had a comforting feeling to it despite the subject matter.  I think it works well, the cast is fantastic and the end result is a great movie.  It is very funny.  All it takes is a look at the bonus materials to find out that Ted Danson actually was TRYING to use ""fey mannerisms"" with his character.  Once again, ignore the ""professional"" critic and watch the movie yourself.  There is a LOT of sexually oriented language (it is about the making of a porn film, after all) but little nudity, a fact that Sam seems to belabor to the point that you have to think he was looking forward to it.",1240444800,3,725,4.217391304347826
3002579,5,B000XJ5UEY,"The Amateurs is a delightful movie about a group of middle-aged men in a small town making a porno movie.  It really reminded me of Nobody's Fool, with Paul Newman.  This is not a porn film, and it is not really dirty.  It is character-driven, with Jeff Bridges in the driver's seat.  All the actor's are engaging (Ted Danson is a hoot, playing against type), and the plot is actually quite sweet.  This film grossed $15K (yes, $15K) during its commercial release.  It seems to be doing better than that with rentals and direct sales now.  If you hate the idea of porn, don't bother with it.  But if you like good movies, the porn aspect is just the hook on which the plot is hung.  Sorry, no pun intended.  My wife loves this movie more than I do, and I like it a lot.  The Blu-ray version is very clean and clear.  Check it out.",1235520000,4,830,4.25

His character is a man with no profession, with series of mediocre sales jobs in a small city and unable to support his family.  After his wife leaves him and re-marries to a rich guy, he tries to find a way to impress his young, teenage son.

The story unfolds with the idea of making an amateur porn film in order to make it rich.  His bar buddies pitch in minimal investment and the story takes off.

So when the porn movie is no longer a porn movie but still a success to make everyone make some money, this film turns into its own head with a happy ending.

When will be see Jeff Bridges in a film really worth seeing?  That is what I want to know.",1233446400,,736,4.104895104895105

3002582,3,B000XJ5UEY,"""The Amateurs"" is an interesting film.  I picked it up in the budget bin; so I bought it rather than renting.  Jeff Bridges is the lead.  He always does interesting work from his Oscar-nominated films ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot,"" ""Starman"" & ""The Contender"" to his romantic comedies like ""The Fabulous Baker Boys.""  Here he plays Andy Sargentee, a down-and-out loser who comes up with the wild idea to make an adult film.  Tim Blake Nelson who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B00003CXRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>&nbsp;plays his shy friend and sidekick Barney who helps produce the movie.  In the DVD extras, Nelson relates how he relished playing a role where he winds up with the girl.  Glenne Headly plays that girl, Helen Tatalbaum, who Barney repeatedly tries to approach.  Headley was recently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comeback-Season/dp/B000KB48A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comeback Season</a>&nbsp;and also appeared in ""Mr. Holland's Opus.""  Patrick Fugit plays the cameraman Emmett who records everything and eventually saves the day.  His DVD extra clowning with William Fichtner was a nice glimpse onto the set.  Fichtner who appeared in ""The Dark Knight"" & the Oscar-winning ""Crash"" plays Andy's buddy Otis who has a knack for securing talent for the film.  He approaches Ellie who sells mattresses and has a crush on her boss.  Judy Greer who was in ""The Wedding Planner"" plays Ellie who jumps on mattresses.  Otis also finds V who is played by Valerie Perrine.  Perrine was one of the most beautiful film actresses in the 70s, receiving her Oscar nomination for ""Lenny"" in 1974.  Joe Pantoliano who I will always remember as the traitor Cypher in the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;plays the film director they call ""Some Idiot.""  That is his character name!  In the DVD extras, Mary Steenburgen who auditioned for the film relates how she urged her husband Ted Danson to play the gay character Moose.  Danson came to our attention along with earning several Golden Globe nominations for the famous TV series ""Cheers"" and won a Golden Globe ""Something About Amelia.""  He says he always wanted to play a gay guy.  The scene where he tries to shoot a scene with V and can't rise to the occasion is as hilarious as it is pitiful.  John Hawkes who was in ""The Perfect Storm"" plays Moe.  He is buddies with Brad Henke's Ron.  Henke was in two films I liked a lot,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Must-Love-Dogs-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000BNX3B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Must Love Dogs (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zodiac-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000QUCNP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zodiac (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

Isaiah Washington from TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"" & ""Ally McBeal"" plays Homer who is insulted when his size is questioned.  Jeanne Tripplehorn who played opposite Tom Cruise in 1993's ""The Firm"" plays Andy's ex-wife Thelma.  Alex D. Linz does a nice job as Andy's basketball-loving son Billy.  Lauren Graham from TV's ""The Gilmore Girls"" plays Peggy who develops a crush on Andy.  Michael Traeger directs his first feature.  He's moderately successful in pulling the film together.  Somehow, it doesn't completely seem to engage.  The film was released in the United Kingdom under the title ""The Moguls,"" but went direct to DVD stateside.

3002583,5,B000XJ5UEY,"Every once in a while, a comedy comes along that is actually a comedy--and this film IS funny! The plot moves along at a good pace with interesting characters; and the screenplay is very creative and well done. Fans of Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson and the other talented actors in this flick are sure to love it.

The Amateurs begins by introducing us to Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) who is a middle aged, unsuccessful and frustrated man who never seems to be able to hold a job. It costs him his wife and kid; and his friends at the local watering hole don't seem to offer him much help in achieving his goals of an ""accomplishment,"" either. Just when things look absolutely hopeless for Andy, he comes up with an idea--he'll make an adult movie! Trouble is, however, Andy and his friends ""Moose"" (Ted Danson), Otis (William Fichtner), a guy everyone calls ""Some Idiot"" (Joe Pantoliano) and others lack the money and the cast for Andy's film to become a reality.

Soon, however, people in the small town where Andy and his buddies live slowly become interested in the idea. Andy gets guys on board to shoot the film (look for a great performance by Patrick Fugit as Emmett, the young man with the video camera), write the script (they really needed one?) and eventually they find a handful of ladies willing to participate, too.

Will Andy and his buddies, along with the cast, find fame and fortune after making their adult flick? Will it ever be completed--it can be tough to do ""casting"" for this type of film in the small town Andy lives in. And, if it IS completed, will it sell and make money for them all? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The DVD comes with commentaries and the ""behind the scenes"" extra is a very informative and entertaining look at how they really made this picture.

I highly recommend this film for fans of more independent films; but it also can appeal to mainstream audiences with such a great cast. Jeff Bridges and Ted Danson are absolutely excellent.

Overall, get this film and enjoy it today! You won't regret it.",1227225600,,2094,4.600536193029491
3002584,4,B000XJ5UEY,"THE AMATEURS is one of those surprisingly good films that you've never heard of. Some of that is often due to a limited release. Or perhaps to a change in the name of the film. Or perhaps it's loaded with unknown actors. Well two out of three of those are correct.

Even more surprising is the film's plot: a township that comes together to put out a pornographic movie, and all the trouble they have getting the production going, the actors/actresses assigned, and why each of them is doing it. Now before you click off and say, ""I don't want to see a movie about making a porno!"" just hang around for a minute, okay? It is and isn't about that. So let's start from the beginning...

Andy (Jeff Bridges) is having a bad year. His wife has left him. His son is living with his wife's new husband in their mansion-on-the-corner. And Andy wants to impress his son and to make him feel that he has a father who cares very much for him. But he's an out-of-work loser whose every plan always dissipates. But one bar-drinking day, Andy comes up with the idea of making a porno in his little town of Butterfield Face, but doing it with the cast and support of those in town.

Men -- obviously -- flock to the project. Emmett (Patrick Fugit) runs the local video store and loves filming on his digital camera, so he is assigned as the ""cinematographer."" And others fall into various roles as director, producers, and even ""the guy who stands around and watches"" (William Fichtner as Otis). But finding the ladies if tougher. They have no options at first but scouring fast food chains, mattress sellers and the local strip club soon turn up some interesting options.

Then there's the script, which is talked about in such laid back terms that I found myself howling with laughter (""Now we need the lesbian scene ...but I don't know any lesbians. Do you?"" and ""We need the obligatory black guys on white girl scene. Anybody know any black guys?"") The flat faces and matter-of-fact comments during these scenes made it seem like they could be ordering a book at a local bookstore rather than talking about intimate sex acts.

Of course, disaster strikes the film and all seems lost ...until Andy (Bridges) finds out that he's got a back-up plan and pulls magic out of his ...well ...we'll say hat.

The real theme of the movie, though, isn't about making a porno; it's about love between a father and son, and what one father is willing to do in order to make his son proud of him. And it didn't take a porno. Confused? Good. Check out this film and revel in it. It's good. It's surprisingly good.",1220313600,2,4675,6.114329268292683
3002585,4,B000XJ5UEY,"This movie was a big surprise.  A friend rented it and then I immediately bought it.  If you like quirky movies like ""Daddy and Them"" you will love this one.",1217721600,2,157,4.2
3002586,3,B000XJ5UEY,"There is a sweetness and kindness to Jeff Bridges that makes him completely likeable, no matter what the quality of his character. (Seabisquit revealed it to me.) The viewer gets caught up in the sad solution to Andy's (Bridges) lack of direction. The relationships of the small town inspire and bond the characters (a lot of little weirdos) together.
There are scenes that made me cringe, and in one scene where Ted Danson is trying to disprove his gayness, I literally covered my eyes. But there are some distinctly funny moments, mostly delivered by Otis(William Fichtner).
If you are looking for a ""great"" film. This is not your choice. But if you are looking for a funny little film with a twist--you might enjoy this. My husband and I giggled and gave each other incredulous looks through out the movie. Endearing? Poignant? Oh, yea, and don't forget....a little embarrassing.",1217376000,3,882,4.926174496644295

I also confess to having a real soft-spot for films and plays that are charming - ""charm"" is a much under-rated quality. We seem to get a lot of ""manipulative"" and ""cloying,"" but we rarely get to see anyting ""charming."" This film is charming. It's also clever.

Another review compared it to British film and I concur -- it shares its tone with such sweet Brit films as ""Millions"" and the light comedies that came out of Ealing after WWII.

Is this a ""great"" film? Will it go down in the annals of film history? Probably not -- but does it have to? Can't it just be a ""good watch""? I found it pleasurable just watching a great cast coalesce into a great ensemble -- celebrity actors working in tandem with non-celebrities for the good of the story.

3002591,4,B000XJ5UEY,"In 2004 Joe Pantoliano starred in a great little movie called ""Second Best"" in which he played the leader of a bunch of losers whose lot is never going to change.  In 2005 he starred in another movie with a similar theme, but this time the losers win in the end.  This second movie, originally released as ""The Moguls"", is now making the rounds of the video stores under its rechristened title, ""The Amateurs,"" and it is a charming, disarming flick that will take you by surprise.

This time, rather than Pantoliano, the lead loser is Jeff Bridges, a guy for whom simply nothing goes particularly well.  Unable to keep a job, divorced by his wife, in danger of losing the affections of his son and apparently completely beaten, he is nonetheless dogged in his belief that there must be SOMETHING he can do right in this life...and is inexplicably more than amply sustained in this fantasy by his own personal corps of loser, played notably by Pantoliano, Tim Blake Nelson, William Fichtner, and Ted Danson, as well as the rest of the town's fruitcake population, many of whom are losers in their own right.

Bridges' character, Andy, after much thought, finally comes up with an idea that he is absolutely positive will put them all on the map, and put much needed money into all their pockets.  They should, he announces, make a porno film; what could be simpler?

The fact that this crew knows nothing about film, and worse, knows nothing about porn, sets the stage for what follows. As their Stranger in a Strange Land journey continues, Andy undertakes an academic study of the sort of scenes they'll need in their movie, Pantolaino is rendered speechless by a collection of sex toys, and, in a clear send up of his Sam Malone character on ""Cheers,"" Danson proves not to be a ladies man at all.

One bit of pure genius occurs when, although played with a straightforward, small town earnestness, the film takes a Mel Brooks turn to absurdity as the stumbling, bumbling crew is amazed and tickled at their ability to find several more-then-willing local women to star in the film, but at the same time can't seem to find any well-endowed black males, or a single white male willing to play any part in the film at all, in spite of offers of payment and free sex.

This film was obviously a labor of love, as Hollywood stars such as Valerie Perrine, Eileen Brennan, Steven Weber, Brad Garrett and Judy Greer turn in marvelous, if extremely small performances, each adding a special something to the film.

Although this is a film about a sex film, there is literally nothing sexual about it, the small amount of nudity handled with wit and charm.

Although at times the film is downright silly, it is in the end uplifting, and simply a good movie.  If you did not see it during its initial run as ""The Moguls,"" by all means see it as ""The Amateurs.""  You'll be pleasantly surprised.",1211155200,4,2884,4.620352250489237

The performances are very funny -- Ted Danson, Joe Pantoliano, Patric Fugit and Tim Blake Nelson are all top-notch here -- and while there really aren't any surprises, that somehow works with the concept as presented. The film gets a little metafictional toward the end, but it's done in such a way that it isn't very distracting or off-putting. While this will never be a classic, ""The Amateurs"" is at least fun.",1207872000,2,594,4.721153846153846
3002597,4,B000XJ5UEY,"The low-key effect of the film grabbed my attention from the beginning as actor Jeff Bridges began his narration of his life in the little town of Butterface Field. He introduced the characters while playing his character engaged in troubled thought, sitting alone, in the local restaurant bar.

Bridges is Andy Sargentee, a husband and father who places his impulses above the economic viability of the family by relieving himself on the desks of every supervisor he has had (and despises). His wife, played by Jeanne Triplehorn, sets off into divorce and the sunset with the station wagon and their son.

Bridges only support now is the town of Butterface Field, the place in which he was born and raised. The townsfolk know him well enough especially when he is about to come up with a brainstorm, which they are apprehensive about. Friends and neighbors at adjacent tables see the mental storm brewing.  (He led them into a Ponzi scheme before just when the tulip bubble bubbled, proving his brainstorm nothing more than a light drizzle).

But now, he's got it!

He and the town will make a fortune creating a genuine, amateur porn film! He quickly enlists his friends to invest their meager sum and even more meager talents as actors, writers, directors and so on. They also have to get girls for the part, and enlist Black actors for their presumed assets. They find a young, counter girl from an ice cream store, an aging stripper, and a bedding store saleswoman, who insists on getting it on with the storeowner.

Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson, Joe Pantoliano, William Fichtner, Lauren Graham, Glenne Headley, Tim Blake Nelson, and Jeanne Tripplehorn make this ""light"" film work along with the superb direction of Michael Traegor. No actor overplays his or her part. The humor is subtle, even hilarious at some points. And for a movie about porn, there is no flesh or foul language.

A colleague at work recommended this; her stock has gone way up.

This is a keeper.",1207526400,49,1970,4.8076923076923075

I loved it. not for kids. a lot of sex jokes, but, not bathroom stupid kind of jokes. not rude, just stinkin funny! sexual situation - hey, they are making a Porn film, so duh! OK, not for kids.

the main character, played by Jeff Bridges, was lovable, down and out, believable - someone I could relate to. his friends were also a hoot. the narration, by him, funny, subtle, not slap-stick, not gross, but, truly heartwarming laugh out loud funny. as were the situations they got into.

a great ""I got the blues"" day film that will cheer you up, let you forget your problems for the time being, and make you feel a little better about your sad life.

good one. thanks.",1207353600,4,674,4.368
3002599,5,B000XJ5UEY,"THE AMATEURS is about as close to the quality of British film comedies (a high compliment indeed!) as we have seen, thanks to writer/director Michael Traeger.  It is everything a small town community aura represents without the stumbling blocks of cruelty that so often provide the turning point in 'rural stories' that defame the simple homespun humanity that is too often foreign to the big city life. Perhaps to refer to it as 'sweet' will rile some review readers, but for this viewer the overriding emotion at the close of the story is just that - sweet, in the finest sense of the term.

The film is narrated by the down and out, unemployed, newly divorced middle-aged crisis victim Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) who spends his time in the local watering hole trying to come up with an idea that will change his fortune - and life. Giving up his marriage to Thelma (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and his son Billy (Alex D. Linz) has been painful but Andy believes he will somehow regain their respect by discovering his 'big idea'. Surrounding him are other underachievers such as Some Idiot (Joe Pantoliano), Barney Macklehatton (Tim Blake Nelson) hopelessly in love with loony dreamer Helen (Glenne Headly), church janitor Otis (William Fichtner), local video store worker and video buff Emmett (Patrick Fugit), Moe/Ron (John Hawkes and Brad William Henke) who are never seen alone, the closeted gay Moose (Ted Danson), and bartender Floyd (Tom Bower) among other 'observers'.  A wild idea occurs to Andy: he and his friends could make an amateur porn film and make money and gain fame.  Out of both love of Andy and individual needs to make something of their boring existence in the little town, the group commits to helping Andy with his project.  How the steps succeed and fail underline the integrity and unconditional friendship these simple people represent.  Along the way we meet the porn film's stars including Valerie Perrine, Judy Greer, Fiona Hunter, Isaiah Washington, Melinda Dahl - all of whom eagerly participate in the 'very private' filming concept of an amateur porn film.  How the final product is threatened and ultimately survives produces the warm ending to the film.  And along the way we get to know Thelma's new husband Howard (Steven Weber) who breaks the stereotype of the rich new stepfather, and these small town folk including Dawn Didawick, Jayne Taini, Lauren Graham, and  Eileen Brennan (who contributes a very special cameo role).

The film has been named THE MOGULS and DIRTY MOVIE in other countries and perhaps that confusion of titles has been part of the problem of the lack of promotion the film received in the theaters.  But in a way, seeing this very special movie in home surroundings adds to the intimacy and the very warmly honest view of the genuinely kind and caring interrelationships among the people of this small town.  There is much to be learned from this film and the added features include the writer/director sharing the experience with each of the actors in this truly ensemble work.  Highly recommended.

3002600,5,B000XJ5UEY,"""The Amateurs"" won't change your life, but it may make it a little easier to bear.

Yes, it's heartwarming. Yes, the little town is filled with the predictable eccentrics who do the expected offbeat things. Yes, everything ends well for everybody (except the big brother). Despite all those drawbacks, this movie is funny. Great casting, great writing, great acting (as much as is demanded by the material).

The Jeff Bridges overstory and narration is the glue that brings all the individual characters and their lines into one whole; his gentle persona creates the film, not only in the story sense but in reality.

For 95 minutes you get to hang out and drink beer with a genuinely nice bunch of hapless middle-aged ""slackers"" as they set out to redeem their lives by making a porn film.  Everything about this movie is perfect:  great actors, including Jeff Bridges and a dozen familiar faces from tv and small films; a wholly original screenplay; and lots of sex and lots of nudity.  Er, the audience never really SEES the sex and nudity, but the clever way the director suggests-without-showing this important plot element is, like the rest of the film, utterly charming.

  When you finish watching ""The Amateurs"" you will feel like you have been given a very special gift. The framework around the substance of the film is recognizable: A father seeking a meaningful relationship with his son;""characters"" in a small town who stumble around and win in the end- but the movie is much more than that. The characters have dimension, and belie stereotypes.
  This film is about kindness, generosity, friendship, acceptance, and just doing the next right thing. Using the creation of such a crass commodity as a porno film as the vehicle these lessons arrive in is just sublime. ""The Amateurs"" may be rated R for language and sexual content, but I have never seen these potential offenders made so impotent than they are by their treatment in this film. If Frank Capra worked in 2008, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" might well have looked like this movie.

3002604,4,B000XJ5UEY,"I can't quite put this up at the 5 star level, but it's awfully close.

Big props to the cast here as they really do a great job here and seem perfectly cast for the roles each is asked to play.

Lead actor Jeff Bridges puts on a great performance as a man (Andy Sargentee) that is looking for his one big break, but unfortunately has failed at everything he's ever tried.  Early on we find that he lost his wife because he's just not able to be responsible and can't take care of his family because of his lack of steady income.  His son's birthday comes up and he goes to the store to buy a gift for him only to realize he just can't afford the one he feels is right.  Real embarassment kicks in when he goes to his wife's new home and finds that it isn't just a big home, it's a complete mansion.

From that embarassment springs inspiration as Andy sits deep in thought in the town bar.  Eventually he's inspired to make a porn movie with the help and support of his friends, a cast of some of the weirdest and wildest characters you'd ever find assembled.

This film isn't a continuous laugh fest, but it is very entertaining.  Some parts would seem predictable, but the story does a good job of planting timely distractions and diversions along the way that keep things very fresh.

While the movie is about the making of a porn film, the nudity in the film is fairly tasteful and there is no sex really shown in the film.  There are however sexual references, sex toys and discussion of porn movies is prevalent so this isn't a film for the easily disturbed.

3237061,4,B000XJ5UEY,"This is an indy type flick sporting an ""A"" type cast. It all comes together in a satisfying, albeit quiet, fashion.

Here's the scoop. Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) just cannot seem to connect. He can't see eye to eye with a nine to five type gig. He's divorced but not because they had horrible problems. She simply got tired of watching him miss the target. She is now married to a really rich guy and has custody of their son who loves his dad more than his new, rich surroundings. Andy has hosted a series of failed business  ventures with his buddies and other residents of their really small town. He now has the mega idea for him and his buds to go in on making a porn movie. A few of the group know just enough to get it started, but their inexperience proves to be nearly insurmountable.

This is a good-hearted film which is more than underlined with the final song. Though more motivated, Bridges' character is a short putt from ""The Big Lebowski."" What is going on here is the idea of friendship and acceptance. None of these guys is a success by normal, Western, capitalist standards. And though they've been burnt by past Bridges' failed ideas they still get on board with the new one. The rub here is that these are genuinely decent guys trying to do something that isn't suited to them. Making a porn film demands a more calloused set of sensibilities. They don't even feel comfortable watching the action they are filming. So of course it is doomed to fail. But in that failure emerges their greater triumph and makes them closer than they were in the beginning.

The cast is great and all do a good job. These actors must have all worked for less than their standard rate because this is a modestly budgeted outing that I cannot imagine would normally support them. But they all work well together and you're pulling for them in the end. Though modest, it's directed, shot and cut as good as it needed to be. Comparisons to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" have been made. Those comparisons are warranted but obviously for the heart and not the content. If you like a feel-good flick that isn't sappy, this is for you.",1353283200,,2127,4.5025906735751295

This is a very slow movie and long movie.  The plot is very simplistic; an ordinary man who lives in a small town is determined to make a porno that will make it big and have a great payout.  However, when you watch the movie it will seem that it's a lot of no name actors in a low budget movie where not much happens.  There's no action, really no special effects and no strong humor, maybe some very seldom dumb humor.

In this case, it's a movie that seems to have a relatively good trailer, but it's one of those movies where after you watch it, you find that the trailer consists of the only good parts of the movie (about 30 seconds worth of material).  Of the hundreds of movie I have, this is in the bottom five (not even bottom 10) worst movies I've seen/own.  After having a terrible movie marathon with a friend who was determined beyond a doubt that he had the worst movie (Mars Attacks), even he agreed that this movie was worse.  We couldn't even make it through the whole movie, it was that bad; it was too slow and painfully unwatchable.  After having watched the whole movie myself, I was fine putting this movie away after the first half.  So after a second opinion, the movie's terrible!  Buy Mars Attacks instead, you'll be able to make it through that movie much more easily and there's more humor in that.",1309651200,,1596,4.380952380952381
3237066,3,B000XJ5UEY,"Actually, 2.5 stars. Taking the conceit of Waiting for Guffman a little further, The Amateurs follows the misadventures of a troop of small-town losers as they take a shot at fame and fortune--by making a do-it-yourself porno film. The cast is terrific--Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson, Glenne Headly, Joe Pantoliano etc. And the group's fumbling, embarrassed efforts to recruit amateur porno actors--and film them--are oddly sweet and affecting. Of course, things go hilariously wrong at the end, but the day is saved (in a way that was predictable 20 minutes into the film). And here the movie goes entirely off the tracks with its unbelievable Hollywood ending. It would be one thing if the amateur pornographers had gotten a hint of success at the end--a spot of hope and pride.

3237070,4,B000XJ5UEY,"Though it is listed in IMDB as The Moguls, the title was changed to The Amateurs. One title was meant to be ironic and the other is sincere. I think sincere is the way to go, for The Amateurs is nothing if not sincere. Though the subject could be sleazy, it is handled so sweetly--it is the story of an unemployed but sincere man (Jeff Bridges) who inspires his friends in a small town to pull together and against all odds make a movie. A dirty movie.

The Dude Abides

Bridges will always be known as The Dude from The Big Lebowski, regardless of what other roles he plays. Cast as the President of the United States, he was heard to remark, ""so, The Dude gets to be President."" Now that he has won the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Country Singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart, The Dude has finally received some recognition. In The Amateurs, made just before his Oscar win, he has created another great character--he may be an unemployed incompetent, but he has a big heart.

Jeff Bridges was finally persuaded to do this project because of the writing. Michael Traeger wrote the script and directed. He was a first time director, but Bridges has had good luck with first time writer/directors because they have usually spent a lot of time thinking about the movie while writing the script, and by the time they get to direct, they have a very good idea of what they're looking for.

There is a character in The Amateurs who also wants to be a Writer/Director. He is called Some Idiot. ""Some"" for short. The film within a film was written and directed by ""Some Idiot"" and his directing chair is inscribed ""Some Idiot."" Some Idiot is played by veteran character actor Joe Pantoliano. You might have noticed him in Daredevil, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, The Matrix, Bound, Midnight Run, The Goonies, or Risky Business. He suffers from depression and has written a book and has a web site devoted to helping others with similar issues.

Ted Danson plays Moose, who pretends to be a mucho macho he man but is gay. He doesn't really fool anyone. Ted Danson will always be known as Sam Malone, the former ballplayer and current womanizer/bar owner from ""Cheers."" Or ""Becker,"" or the guy on ""Ink,"" or most likely, the guy who was dating Whoopie Goldberg and thought it would be funny to show up with her at a Roast in Blackface and make watermelon jokes. One of his fondest ambitions was to do the same sort of over the top characterization of a gay character. In the context of The Amateurs this is very sweet, because his friends still accept him; in fact they have known all along.

Patrick Fugit is best known for playing the young Rolling Stone writer in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous. In Amateurs he plays a film buff that works in a video store and is hired to run the camera. He is also shooting video footage. It is a quiet, nuanced performance. He blends in with his surroundings, and you don't even notice that he's filming everything.

Timothy Blake Nelson plays Barney Macklehatton, and in the context of The Amateurs, it is one of the more normal roles. He is the romantic lead who might even get the girl. He usually is cast as a freakish misfit of some kind, such as his role in O, Brother, Where Art Thou? It was a rare opportunity for him, and he relished the chance. Plus, he got to work with Jeff Bridges who is after all, The Dude.

William Fichtner is another veteran character actor who was in numerous films that are well known to the film going public: The Dark Knight, The Chumscrubber, Crash, Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor, The Perfect Storm, Armageddon, Albino Alligator, Strange Days, Quiz Show, and Malcolm X. Otis, the character he plays, is very enthusiastic about the project but everyone is being asked to put up $2,000 and his assets lack the necessary liquidity:

----------
Otis: I'm in. Except for no money, it's a no-brainer for me. First off, making a stag film *has* to be a good time. Number two, my hat's off to you. Good job. We can do this. Wha-what are we talking about here? Making a dirty movie - film, whatever, whatever. What does that require? Pointing a camera at a he and a she... he'in and a-she'in.
==================

He just wants to stand around and watch everything. Is there a job like that? Turns out there is, and he is made an executive producer.
Now, they just need talent and some of the actors and actresses in the film within a film are Isaiah Washington who was not the bartender on ""The Love Boat"" but was Dr. Preston Burke on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" the guy who was forced to publicly apologize for insensitive remarks and then fired; Judy Greer, who played Judith's snarky but sexy sister Myra on ""Two and a Half Men;"" Valerie Perrine, from Can't Stop the Music with The Village People; and Glenne Headly, who played Tess Trueheart in Dick Tracy.

Other cast members of note are Jeanne Tripplehorn, who played Jackie O. on Grey Gardens, as well as being in *Waterworld* and *Basic Instinct*; Lauren Graham, Lorelai Gilmore of ""The Gilmore Girls"" and currently Sarah Braverman on ""Parenthood;"" Steven Weber, who was Brian Michael Hackett on ""Wings;"" and Brad Garrett who was Robert Barone on ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Though the rest of the cast of The Amateurs were less well known, and in fact may have actually been amateurs, they also provided strong contributions to the success of the project.

The Bottom Line is The Amateurs is a very likeable indie film about making a film. For a film about making a dirty movie it is surprisingly sweet. Along with the amateurs, there is some very big talent, like Oscar winning actor Jeff Bridges -- The Dude. He pulls the whole thing together.

Otis: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

terribly written. With a cast like this it should've been a brilliant comedy. It is not. What we get is good actors sleep-walking through the script. Just awlful.
Visually, it looks like they use videotape, you know, where you get 4 blank tapes for the price of 3.
As far as the story goes, they keep talking about ""the town"" getting involved with making the movie. All you see are the same 6 morons. It's hard to enjoy a movie when you don't feel empathy for any of the actors. Bridges deserved all the bad stuff that happened to him.",1266364800,,619,4.391304347826087
3237073,3,B000XJ5UEY,"I'll admit something. If this hadn't come on tv & there hadn't been anything else to watch or do, I probably wouldn't have watched this movie. I do enjoy Jeff Bridges, but some of his stuff is hit & miss. Plus it's hard to watch him now & not compare his every non-villain role to his character of Lebowski. After watching this film, I'm glad I watched it. It's really very cute & will get overlooked by many.

The film follows a group of friends who decide to make a porno. Leading the group is Andy, a guy who has given up on a lot in his life, including his marriage. Along for the ride are a group of guys that include a man who goes by the name of ""Some Guy"" as well as a young man who records just about everything he sees. They all agree to help for their own personal reasons, some of which are obvious & others which develop slowly throughout the film.

Honestly, this movie was cute. It's not something I'd rush out & buy, but it is something I'd recommend a friend to watch at some point in time. The characters are nice, but at the same time they didn't really reach out to me all that much. As the saying goes, ""it's not quite milk, but not yet a shake"". The film is better than many indie films I've seen, but it just seems to lack some sort of ""oomph"" that would've pushed it along & made it stand out more than some of the other films out there.

This film will be a must have for fans of Bridges, but for the rest of us... just rent it for right now. If you then decide that you just have to have it, go ahead & buy it.",1259452800,,1536,4.0130718954248366

it's a movie about friends,

it's a movie about success!!

Jeff Bridges stars as Andy Sargentee, a driven man with no direction, a kind-hearted man who doesn't always know what to do, resulting in the loss of numerous jobs and his marriage.
After long hours of hard thinking, he comes up with a brilliant idea- let's make a porno film and make a million bucks!!  He enlists the help of his good buddies and some townfolk, they set out to find actors, write scenes, and get the movie made.  Hilarity ensues...
There is a great cast in this movie playing great characters that you can't help but get attached to, despite their quirkiness.
Although it is a movie about people making a porno, it is refreshingly wholesome.  And a happy ending to boot!!

I guess the moral of the story is: Sex sells, but having a big heart will bring you real success!!

This is a feel good movie with some awesomely entertaining scenes that I highly recommend!!",1247184000,3,1086,4.51530612244898

I was taken with the fact that the movie had a comforting feeling to it despite the subject matter.  I think it works well, the cast is fantastic and the end result is a great movie.  It is very funny.  All it takes is a look at the bonus materials to find out that Ted Danson actually was TRYING to use ""fey mannerisms"" with his character.  Once again, ignore the ""professional"" critic and watch the movie yourself.  There is a LOT of sexually oriented language (it is about the making of a porn film, after all) but little nudity, a fact that Sam seems to belabor to the point that you have to think he was looking forward to it.",1240444800,3,725,4.217391304347826

This is not a porn film, and it is not really dirty.  It is character-driven, with Jeff Bridges in the driver's seat.  All the actor's are engaging (Ted Danson is a hoot, playing against type), and the plot is actually quite sweet.  This film grossed $15K (yes, $15K) during its commercial release.  It seems to be doing better than that with rentals and direct sales now.  If you hate the idea of porn, don't bother with it.  But if you like good movies, the porn aspect is just the hook on which the plot is hung.  Sorry, no pun intended.  My wife loves this movie more than I do, and I like it a lot.

The story unfolds with the idea of making an amateur porn film in order to make it rich.  His bar buddies pitch in minimal investment and the story takes off.

So when the porn movie is no longer a porn movie but still a success to make everyone make some money, this film turns into its own head with a happy ending.

3237079,3,B000XJ5UEY,"""The Amateurs"" is an interesting film.  I picked it up in the budget bin; so I bought it rather than renting.  Jeff Bridges is the lead.  He always does interesting work from his Oscar-nominated films ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot,"" ""Starman"" & ""The Contender"" to his romantic comedies like ""The Fabulous Baker Boys.""

Patrick Fugit plays the cameraman Emmett who records everything and eventually saves the day.  His DVD extra clowning with William Fichtner was a nice glimpse onto the set.  Fichtner who appeared in ""The Dark Knight"" & the Oscar-winning ""Crash"" plays Andy's buddy Otis who has a knack for securing talent for the film.  He approaches Ellie who sells mattresses and has a crush on her boss.  Judy Greer who was in ""The Wedding Planner"" plays Ellie who jumps on mattresses.  Otis also finds V who is played by Valerie Perrine.  Perrine was one of the most beautiful film actresses in the 70s, receiving her Oscar nomination for ""Lenny"" in 1974.  Joe Pantoliano who I will always remember as the traitor Cypher in the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;plays the film director they call ""Some Idiot.""

Danson came to our attention along with earning several Golden Globe nominations for the famous TV series ""Cheers"" and won a Golden Globe ""Something About Amelia.""  He says he always wanted to play a gay guy.  The scene where he tries to shoot a scene with V and can't rise to the occasion is as hilarious as it is pitiful.

3237080,5,B000XJ5UEY,"Every once in a while, a comedy comes along that is actually a comedy--and this film IS funny! The plot moves along at a good pace with interesting characters; and the screenplay is very creative and well done. Fans of Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson and the other talented actors in this flick are sure to love it.

The Amateurs begins by introducing us to Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) who is a middle aged, unsuccessful and frustrated man who never seems to be able to hold a job. It costs him his wife and kid; and his friends at the local watering hole don't seem to offer him much help in achieving his goals of an ""accomplishment,"" either. Just when things look absolutely hopeless for Andy, he comes up with an idea--he'll make an adult movie! Trouble is, however, Andy and his friends ""Moose"" (Ted Danson), Otis (William Fichtner), a guy everyone calls ""Some Idiot"" (Joe Pantoliano) and others lack the money and the cast for Andy's film to become a reality.

Soon, however, people in the small town where Andy and his buddies live slowly become interested in the idea. Andy gets guys on board to shoot the film (look for a great performance by Patrick Fugit as Emmett, the young man with the video camera), write the script (they really needed one?) and eventually they find a handful of ladies willing to participate, too.

Will Andy and his buddies, along with the cast, find fame and fortune after making their adult flick? Will it ever be completed--it can be tough to do ""casting"" for this type of film in the small town Andy lives in. And, if it IS completed, will it sell and make money for them all? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The DVD comes with commentaries and the ""behind the scenes"" extra is a very informative and entertaining look at how they really made this picture.

I highly recommend this film for fans of more independent films; but it also can appeal to mainstream audiences with such a great cast. Jeff Bridges and Ted Danson are absolutely excellent.

Overall, get this film and enjoy it today! You won't regret it.",1227225600,,2094,4.600536193029491

Now before you click off and say, ""I don't want to see a movie about making a porno!"" just hang around for a minute, okay? It is and isn't about that. So let's start from the beginning...

Andy (Jeff Bridges) is having a bad year. His wife has left him. His son is living with his wife's new husband in their mansion-on-the-corner. And Andy wants to impress his son and to make him feel that he has a father who cares very much for him. But he's an out-of-work loser whose every plan always dissipates. But one bar-drinking day, Andy comes up with the idea of making a porno in his little town of Butterfield Face, but doing it with the cast and support of those in town.

Men -- obviously -- flock to the project. Emmett (Patrick Fugit) runs the local video store and loves filming on his digital camera, so he is assigned as the ""cinematographer."" And others fall into various roles as director, producers, and even ""the guy who stands around and watches"" (William Fichtner as Otis). But finding the ladies if tougher. They have no options at first but scouring fast food chains, mattress sellers and the local strip club soon turn up some interesting options.

Then there's the script, which is talked about in such laid back terms that I found myself howling with laughter (""Now we need the lesbian scene ...but I don't know any lesbians. Do you?"" and ""We need the obligatory black guys on white girl scene. Anybody know any black guys?"") The flat faces and matter-of-fact comments during these scenes made it seem like they could be ordering a book at a local bookstore rather than talking about intimate sex acts.

Of course, disaster strikes the film and all seems lost ...until Andy (Bridges) finds out that he's got a back-up plan and pulls magic out of his ...well ...we'll say hat.

The real theme of the movie, though, isn't about making a porno; it's about love between a father and son, and what one father is willing to do in order to make his son proud of him. And it didn't take a porno. Confused? Good. Check out this film and revel in it. It's good. It's surprisingly good.",1220313600,2,4675,6.114329268292683
3237082,4,B000XJ5UEY,"This movie was a big surprise.  A friend rented it and then I immediately bought it.  If you like quirky movies like ""Daddy and Them"" you will love this one.",1217721600,2,157,4.2
3237083,3,B000XJ5UEY,"There is a sweetness and kindness to Jeff Bridges that makes him completely likeable, no matter what the quality of his character. (Seabisquit revealed it to me.) The viewer gets caught up in the sad solution to Andy's (Bridges) lack of direction. The relationships of the small town inspire and bond the characters (a lot of little weirdos) together.
There are scenes that made me cringe, and in one scene where Ted Danson is trying to disprove his gayness, I literally covered my eyes. But there are some distinctly funny moments, mostly delivered by Otis(William Fichtner).
If you are looking for a ""great"" film. This is not your choice. But if you are looking for a funny little film with a twist--you might enjoy this. My husband and I giggled and gave each other incredulous looks through out the movie. Endearing? Poignant? Oh, yea, and don't forget....a little embarrassing.",1217376000,3,882,4.926174496644295

3237085,4,B000XJ5UEY,"I confess -- I'll watch ANYTHING that has Billy Fichtner in it.

I also confess to having a real soft-spot for films and plays that are charming - ""charm"" is a much under-rated quality. We seem to get a lot of ""manipulative"" and ""cloying,"" but we rarely get to see anyting ""charming."" This film is charming. It's also clever.

Another review compared it to British film and I concur -- it shares its tone with such sweet Brit films as ""Millions"" and the light comedies that came out of Ealing after WWII.

Is this a ""great"" film? Will it go down in the annals of film history? Probably not -- but does it have to? Can't it just be a ""good watch""? I found it pleasurable just watching a great cast coalesce into a great ensemble -- celebrity actors working in tandem with non-celebrities for the good of the story.

And, of course, it has Billy Fichtner.",1215734400,4,853,4.414012738853503

3237088,4,B000XJ5UEY,"In 2004 Joe Pantoliano starred in a great little movie called ""Second Best"" in which he played the leader of a bunch of losers whose lot is never going to change.  In 2005 he starred in another movie with a similar theme, but this time the losers win in the end.  This second movie, originally released as ""The Moguls"", is now making the rounds of the video stores under its rechristened title, ""The Amateurs,"" and it is a charming, disarming flick that will take you by surprise.

This time, rather than Pantoliano, the lead loser is Jeff Bridges, a guy for whom simply nothing goes particularly well.  Unable to keep a job, divorced by his wife, in danger of losing the affections of his son and apparently completely beaten, he is nonetheless dogged in his belief that there must be SOMETHING he can do right in this life...and is inexplicably more than amply sustained in this fantasy by his own personal corps of loser, played notably by Pantoliano, Tim Blake Nelson, William Fichtner, and Ted Danson, as well as the rest of the town's fruitcake population, many of whom are losers in their own right.

Bridges' character, Andy, after much thought, finally comes up with an idea that he is absolutely positive will put them all on the map, and put much needed money into all their pockets.  They should, he announces, make a porno film; what could be simpler?

The fact that this crew knows nothing about film, and worse, knows nothing about porn, sets the stage for what follows. As their Stranger in a Strange Land journey continues, Andy undertakes an academic study of the sort of scenes they'll need in their movie, Pantolaino is rendered speechless by a collection of sex toys, and, in a clear send up of his Sam Malone character on ""Cheers,"" Danson proves not to be a ladies man at all.

One bit of pure genius occurs when, although played with a straightforward, small town earnestness, the film takes a Mel Brooks turn to absurdity as the stumbling, bumbling crew is amazed and tickled at their ability to find several more-then-willing local women to star in the film, but at the same time can't seem to find any well-endowed black males, or a single white male willing to play any part in the film at all, in spite of offers of payment and free sex.

This film was obviously a labor of love, as Hollywood stars such as Valerie Perrine, Eileen Brennan, Steven Weber, Brad Garrett and Judy Greer turn in marvelous, if extremely small performances, each adding a special something to the film.

Although this is a film about a sex film, there is literally nothing sexual about it, the small amount of nudity handled with wit and charm.

Although at times the film is downright silly, it is in the end uplifting, and simply a good movie.  If you did not see it during its initial run as ""The Moguls,"" by all means see it as ""The Amateurs.""  You'll be pleasantly surprised.",1211155200,4,2884,4.620352250489237

The performances are very funny -- Ted Danson, Joe Pantoliano, Patric Fugit and Tim Blake Nelson are all top-notch here -- and while there really aren't any surprises, that somehow works with the concept as presented. The film gets a little metafictional toward the end, but it's done in such a way that it isn't very distracting or off-putting.

3237094,4,B000XJ5UEY,"The low-key effect of the film grabbed my attention from the beginning as actor Jeff Bridges began his narration of his life in the little town of Butterface Field. He introduced the characters while playing his character engaged in troubled thought, sitting alone, in the local restaurant bar.

Bridges is Andy Sargentee, a husband and father who places his impulses above the economic viability of the family by relieving himself on the desks of every supervisor he has had (and despises). His wife, played by Jeanne Triplehorn, sets off into divorce and the sunset with the station wagon and their son.

Bridges only support now is the town of Butterface Field, the place in which he was born and raised. The townsfolk know him well enough especially when he is about to come up with a brainstorm, which they are apprehensive about. Friends and neighbors at adjacent tables see the mental storm brewing.  (He led them into a Ponzi scheme before just when the tulip bubble bubbled, proving his brainstorm nothing more than a light drizzle).

But now, he's got it!

He and the town will make a fortune creating a genuine, amateur porn film! He quickly enlists his friends to invest their meager sum and even more meager talents as actors, writers, directors and so on. They also have to get girls for the part, and enlist Black actors for their presumed assets. They find a young, counter girl from an ice cream store, an aging stripper, and a bedding store saleswoman, who insists on getting it on with the storeowner.

Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson, Joe Pantoliano, William Fichtner, Lauren Graham, Glenne Headley, Tim Blake Nelson, and Jeanne Tripplehorn make this ""light"" film work along with the superb direction of Michael Traegor. No actor overplays his or her part. The humor is subtle, even hilarious at some points. And for a movie about porn, there is no flesh or foul language.

A colleague at work recommended this; her stock has gone way up.

3237096,5,B000XJ5UEY,"THE AMATEURS is about as close to the quality of British film comedies (a high compliment indeed!) as we have seen, thanks to writer/director Michael Traeger.  It is everything a small town community aura represents without the stumbling blocks of cruelty that so often provide the turning point in 'rural stories' that defame the simple homespun humanity that is too often foreign to the big city life. Perhaps to refer to it as 'sweet' will rile some review readers, but for this viewer the overriding emotion at the close of the story is just that - sweet, in the finest sense of the term.

The film is narrated by the down and out, unemployed, newly divorced middle-aged crisis victim Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) who spends his time in the local watering hole trying to come up with an idea that will change his fortune - and life. Giving up his marriage to Thelma (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and his son Billy (Alex D. Linz) has been painful but Andy believes he will somehow regain their respect by discovering his 'big idea'. Surrounding him are other underachievers such as Some Idiot (Joe Pantoliano), Barney Macklehatton (Tim Blake Nelson) hopelessly in love with loony dreamer Helen (Glenne Headly), church janitor Otis (William Fichtner), local video store worker and video buff Emmett (Patrick Fugit), Moe/Ron (John Hawkes and Brad William Henke) who are never seen alone, the closeted gay Moose (Ted Danson), and bartender Floyd (Tom Bower) among other 'observers'.  A wild idea occurs to Andy: he and his friends could make an amateur porn film and make money and gain fame.  Out of both love of Andy and individual needs to make something of their boring existence in the little town, the group commits to helping Andy with his project.  How the steps succeed and fail underline the integrity and unconditional friendship these simple people represent.  Along the way we meet the porn film's stars including Valerie Perrine, Judy Greer, Fiona Hunter, Isaiah Washington, Melinda Dahl - all of whom eagerly participate in the 'very private' filming concept of an amateur porn film.  How the final product is threatened and ultimately survives produces the warm ending to the film.  And along the way we get to know Thelma's new husband Howard (Steven Weber) who breaks the stereotype of the rich new stepfather, and these small town folk including Dawn Didawick, Jayne Taini, Lauren Graham, and  Eileen Brennan (who contributes a very special cameo role).

The film has been named THE MOGULS and DIRTY MOVIE in other countries and perhaps that confusion of titles has been part of the problem of the lack of promotion the film received in the theaters.  But in a way, seeing this very special movie in home surroundings adds to the intimacy and the very warmly honest view of the genuinely kind and caring interrelationships among the people of this small town.  There is much to be learned from this film and the added features include the writer/director sharing the experience with each of the actors in this truly ensemble work.  Highly recommended.

Yes, it's heartwarming. Yes, the little town is filled with the predictable eccentrics who do the expected offbeat things. Yes, everything ends well for everybody (except the big brother). Despite all those drawbacks, this movie is funny. Great casting, great writing, great acting (as much as is demanded by the material).

The Jeff Bridges overstory and narration is the glue that brings all the individual characters and their lines into one whole; his gentle persona creates the film, not only in the story sense but in reality.

Big props to the cast here as they really do a great job here and seem perfectly cast for the roles each is asked to play.

Lead actor Jeff Bridges puts on a great performance as a man (Andy Sargentee) that is looking for his one big break, but unfortunately has failed at everything he's ever tried.  Early on we find that he lost his wife because he's just not able to be responsible and can't take care of his family because of his lack of steady income.  His son's birthday comes up and he goes to the store to buy a gift for him only to realize he just can't afford the one he feels is right.  Real embarassment kicks in when he goes to his wife's new home and finds that it isn't just a big home, it's a complete mansion.

From that embarassment springs inspiration as Andy sits deep in thought in the town bar.  Eventually he's inspired to make a porn movie with the help and support of his friends, a cast of some of the weirdest and wildest characters you'd ever find assembled.

This film isn't a continuous laugh fest, but it is very entertaining.  Some parts would seem predictable, but the story does a good job of planting timely distractions and diversions along the way that keep things very fresh.

While the movie is about the making of a porn film, the nudity in the film is fairly tasteful and there is no sex really shown in the film.  There are however sexual references, sex toys and discussion of porn movies is prevalent so this isn't a film for the easily disturbed.

the plot

Andy had a great life with a beautiful wife and a son living in a rural small town with lots of friends. When his inability to adhere to the life of a 9 to 5 schlub and earn a living, his wife took his son and left him until he was able to get his life together. It's been a while and his wife had since divorced him and married a very rich man and his son is getting used to his very cozy surroundings. When Andy had tried to buy a great basketball for his son's birthday and could only afford a mediocre substitute he tried to pass it off as a pro ball which he then forged Michael Jordan's signature. Andy arrived at his wife's mansion and headed upstairs to his son's basketball bedroom and noticed the dozen or so pro balls signed by the real Michael Jordan. Andy knew that he had to make a change and he had to make it now before he lost his son as well.

He got the bright idea to make some big money and quick by making a porno movie. Five of his friends signed on to the idea, and they all put up some cash and made plans and then tried to make it work. Finding the right cast members would be a challenge as they find the right actors' in their hometown. They would need a couple of lesbians for one scene, three more women for three different scenes and three ""big"" black guys. Each time they thought they solved a problem they ran into another one. The black guys they hired turned out to not be as ""big"" as they hoped. One of the girls they hired had a crazy brother in jail who if he found out about his little sister would go crazy on these hopeful would be pornographers. Is it possible for these guys to get it together long enough to be successful just once in their lives? Or more likely will they fail again at this as they all have in life?

the breakdown

This film has been in my instant queue for over a year, thank goodness it is still available to watch via streaming through Netflix. The Amateurs turned out to be a very funny film with a terrific cast headed by the one and only Jeff Bridges. Whenever we're lucky enough to catch Bridges on screen, we're either going to love or hate his characters. In The Amateurs as Andy, he not only plays a character that we care about, but we root for him to be successful in pornography. Andy is the ultimate underdog here; living in a town with virtually no opportunities and he is still inspired to make it big the easy way. Then we cheer even more so when he finds it won't be as easy as he first thought.

Maybe because of the small town setting, pretty much all of the character names mirror those from the 1960s sitcom, The Andy Griffith Show. There's Jeff Bridges' Andy, there's also Barney, Otis, Helen, Clara, Thelma, Howard and Emmett. I suppose Gomer would have been too overt, so they substituted this with the nickname Some Idiot, or as they usually call him, Some. The small town wasn't called Mayberry, but the more comical alternative Butterface Fields.

The unlikely hero from this motley bunch was Otis, played by William Fichtner. Now like Otis, William had a drinking problem, but when it came time to pull it together he got their idea of making a movie back on track every time it seemed like it was over for some reason or another. Fichtner's Otis was the character who made me laugh the most, although I found the narration supplied by Jeff Bridges pretty funny too. I initially put this film in my queue because I saw that Lauren Graham was in it, and although this is true, her part was the smallest out of everybody. I do like Joe Pantoliano, the actor who is usually typecast as the typical Italian sidekick nerd, but here he plays Some Idiot. Some Idiot is looked at by his fellow townsfolk as what his nickname suggests, but he wants to prove himself as having the brains by taking on the role of writer/director of this porno film. Ted Danson plays against type as Moose; a stereotypical homosexual, yet he believes he's still in the closet despite his sheer flamboyance, very funny.

I was kind of looking forward to some sort of nudity as some sort of payoff to all of the very frank sex chatter throughout the movie, but alas there was none. At least Lauren Graham looked as beautiful as always, even though it was just for mere moments. In the end, this is really just an endearing father-son love story between Andy and Op...well, whatever his son's name was. Too bad the R rating prevents most fathers and sons from watching this together. I thought this was very funny, with loveable characters within an appealing setting. I give this four stars.
