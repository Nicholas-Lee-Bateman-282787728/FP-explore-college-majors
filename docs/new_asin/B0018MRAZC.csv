3417760,5,B0018MRAZC,"When was the last time you saw a ballet at the end of which you had that warm fuzzy feeling of being utterly entertained and happy ( like the first time you saw the Wizard of Oz?). If they gave out Oscars for the most enjoyable ballet production of this decade this La Fille Mal Gardee should win hands down.
This has to be Ashton at his most whimsical and artistic best, a brilliant and idiomatic piece of choreography of a simple village love affair set in the perpetual sunshine of his beloved Suffolk countryside. Herold's music is unpretentious but melodic and memorable, the costumes colourful and strongly evocative of the rustic setting and the dancers bring the house down with their vigorous and wonderful performances. They appear as if they were all having a gay old time at it.
Firstly, Nunez gives a great characterization of the willful,wayward daughter Lise, and Carlos Acosta impresses with his graceful and athletic dancing as her admirer and suitor. The pas de deux  are beautifully done, with whirling pirouettes and energetic lifts, both stars are in top form. But this ballet is more than just perfection of the dance, it is wit and frothy humour that makes makes this champagne bubble. And here it is William Tuckett as the widow Simone who almost steals the show. With a wry face and Chaplinesque mime, she provokes more than a few chuckles as the rascally mother hell bent on marrying Lise to Alain, the rich farmer's son. And her famous 'clog dance' is well, hilarious. As for Alain, was there ever a more lovable simpleton in all of ballet ?
The set pieces are wonderfully choreographed and eye-catching, notably the Maypole dance and the storm scene which ends Act 1 where the dancers really appear to be blown like leaves in the wind. And of course the rousing finale with the expected happy ending. Mere words fall short of the delight this ballet has given me. I watched it with an eleven year old ballet student who had just the week before scandalized her mother by falling asleep watching a performance of Swan Lake . No danger of that here. Yelps of delight, giggles and even hand clapping at the end of each engaging scene. And after the finale, she beamed at me and asked if we could play it again the next evening. Five stars ? That request alone made it worth a sixth !",1268438400,5,2308,4.615571776155718

Carlos Acosta and Marianela Nunez are outstanding. This would make a great double feature for my grandkids with Natalie Dessay's La Fille du Regiment.",1249344000,2,305,8.870967741935484
3417762,5,B0018MRAZC,"For folks who are not familiar with this ballet, it's a romantic comedy. The plot is simple. Girl loves poor farm hand. Widowed mother wants her to marry the doltish son of a neighbor. True loves wins out. I saw this production in London about 2 1/2 years ago. This DVD helped me relive wonderful memories. Frederick Ashton did the choreography, and is a genius. One of his innovations is a comic clog dance by the heroine's mother who is portrayed by a 6'6"" male dancer. The dancing is superb. The costumes are colorful. The music is lush. The story is easy to follow, and  the ""scenario"" feature answers questions you might have about the plot.  My 4-year grand-niece has just started ballet lessons, and I'm buying her a copy. Don't miss the beginning of the video. The camera pans around the theater to show you the beautiful interior of the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden.",1230336000,18,881,4.6050955414012735
3417763,5,B0018MRAZC,"I echo the good reviews of this performance.  I have both Royal Ballet versions and, while the earlier one is good, this is great.  Nunez, Acosta, Tuckett and Howells all bring great skill to their roles but I think this version has more humor.
I always appreciate Ashton's choreography but I do think that this is his shining star.  It may have a French title and be set in the French countryside but it is all English - down to the Lancashire clog dance.
I have friends who are not ballet fans who love this ballet  - and it's hard not to with the dancing cockrell and his hens, the maypole, the wonderful use of ribbons throughout the ballet, the colorful costumes and cartoon-like background - and there's that clog dance.",1226016000,9,726,4.519083969465649
3417764,5,B0018MRAZC,"Don't let the fun and lightness of this ballet fool you. There's some excellent dancing here. I don't want to reiterate IvyLin's excellent review. I think in addition to the dancing you will get great pleasure in the wonderful colors of the costumes and scenery, the attention to detail even among the corps dancers and the joy communicated by the ensemble. Herold gets credit for the music which igores Rossini's (Barber...) and Donizetti's (L'Elisir...) contributions - so I mention them here. I hope we'll get more Carlos Acosta DVD's and Marianela Nunez is a wonder. Unless Ashton is not your cup of tea, do get this DVD.",1225065600,5,625,4.850467289719626
3417765,5,B0018MRAZC,"This DVD was one of the recommendations that Amazon had for me. I think I might have heard of the work previously, but I had no idea what it was about. After reading the review by Ms. Ivy Linn I decided that I would take a chance and buy it. I am so glad I did. As an Opus DVD from the BBC of a work performed at the Royal Opera House and directed by Ross MacGibbon the quality of audio and video is assured and there is very little that I need to add to the other review.
What I was not prepared for, was the wonderful colors of the costumes and the slightly cartoon nature of Osbert Lancaster's sets. The color and lighting of the storm following the maypole dance are particularly effective. The music, pieced together from a number of popular composer's works, is very pleasant and full of joy. The aria from Barber of Seville was immediately recognizable but, although the booklet included refers to tunes from Donizetti and Ignaz Pleyel, these were not known to me. This is a very light-hearted ballet with excellent dancing and miming from the two principals, Carlos Acosta and Marianela Nuez, and a spirited clog dance from William Tucket in pantomime drag as the Widow Simone.

Very highly recommended for both young children and balletomanes alike.",1218499200,20,1258,4.566371681415929
3417766,5,B0018MRAZC,"I purchased this CD to entertain my two grandchildren, seven anad three years of age.  Both loved the dancing, the animals, the music and the scenery. The Royal Ballet is always a treat to watch and the children see this CD over  anad over.",1399161600,,240,4.431818181818182
3417767,5,B0018MRAZC,"This ballet is so humorous and performed so well by the dancers that it is a pleasure to watch.  There is an excitement to this ballet that you may not find in the strictly classical ones!  The principal dancers are stunningly beautiful together, and the ""character"" performers as well as the members of the corps de ballet are a joy to watch!  Buy this ballet, you won't be sorry!",1388275200,,381,4.492753623188406
3417768,2,B0018MRAZC,"The set is charming and sunny in the beginning, the chicken dance is absolutely hilarious. There are lots of humor from the leading dancers, and off course Widow Simone steals part of the show with the clog dance.
However halfway through show, the plot is getting predictable, and become less interesting.
The dancing is all right, nothing much to say on the technical side.
A funny and charming ballet, well that's pretty much it.",1362268800,3,431,4.837837837837838
3417769,5,B0018MRAZC,"This wonderful Frederick Ashton confection from 1960 has remained a firm favourite for audiences ever since its first performance and this 2005 recording does it full justice. The ballet, with music by H&eacute;rold skilfully arranged by John Lanchbery, is a delightful confection incorporating many musical delights to match the inspired Ashton choreography.

The opening scene of the farmyard with the cockerel and hens is completely endearing and is the perfect example of Ashton's unerring sense of style where the humorous effect is achieved by no-compromise seriously good dancing which then frees the audience to enjoy the concept. Much the same can be said of the milk churn sequence, the various dances featuring ribbons, the maypole, the clog dance and everything to do with the hapless and clueless suitor, Alain. Nothing is overplayed and much is achieved by delicious under-statement and this informs every minute of this delightful ballet.

Of course, much depends on the abilities of the various dancers and the company to translate Ashton's choreography into the reality of a performance and this involves dancing of great skill. Again, the secret is to allow the charm of the choreography to come through unimpeded by any form of `humorous' exaggeration. All of this is achieved in every detail in this wonderful production which aims to reproduce the original Ashton concept as closely as possible.

Acosta and Nunez make an ideal pairing and their mutual empathy comes over in every step they take. Their good natured relationship provides the core emotional stability around which the other characterisations revolve. The essentially humorous roles of Widow Simone, performed by William Tuckett, and Alain, performed by Jonathan Howells, are further examples of tasteful and gentle humour underpinned with rock-steady technical skill. The corps de ballet maintain this pastoral idyll with dancing of equal quality and where the dancers' individual enjoyment of the ballet is plainly there to be seen on the recording.

The orchestra under the guidance of Anthony Twiner plays with precision and evident enthusiasm throughout. The staging and costuming are further examples of Ashton's perfect sense of understated but sure-footed style.

The bonuses are limited to an illustrated synopsis plus the cast gallery typical of Opus Arte. There is a very informative and interesting booklet supplied.

The whole production is presented with a recording of good quality. The camera work is involving with crisp imaging giving an ideal blend of close and panoramic views as appropriate. The sound is excellent and is presented in 5.1 surround and stereo formats.

This is a dream production of a dream ballet given by a dream team and granted a totally sympathetic recording. The joy of the production and performance cannot be missed and is readily communicated through the recording.

I would therefore suggest that this fully warrants serious consideration as a potential purchase option.",1347062400,,3003,5.388059701492537
3417770,5,B0018MRAZC,"Like the other reviewers, I found this a delightful performance by the Royal, and Nunez and Accosta could hardly be bettered in the leads; however, from quite early on in the performance I found myself wishing the music was taken just that bit faster. By the time we reached the harvesting scene, the famous pas de deux fails to fizz, and the dancers' performance is robbed of brilliance. I then switched over to the Collier/Coleman performance - and it was a different experience, breathless with excitement and fun, because the music was faster. Not sure what other reviewers think, but I find this a shortcoming with many of the Royal Ballet recorded performances, including the recent Sleeping Beauty.",1343433600,5,705,4.983050847457627
3417771,5,B0018MRAZC,"The performance are great, a lot of ballet, less acting, excellent production, dancers wow, you would never regret to buy this dvd",1329091200,,130,4.954545454545454
3417772,5,B0018MRAZC,"Despite the obvious technical superiority of Blue-ray, I found myself torn between the 2005 production and that of 1981, which I have on LaserDisc. On indepth comparison, I had to keep them both. In my mind, Lesley Collyer and Michael Coleman have the edge over Marianela Nunez and Carlos Acosta in their dancing and mime. Heart-rending, more believable, these are two youngsters very much in love, while Nunez and Acosta are simply putting on a brilliant show. Notice also that in the cat cradle, Acosta fumbles, almost loses it, while Coleman completes a brilliant move - to an audience ovation. Both Brian Shaw and Garry Grant are also much funnier as the Widow Simone and Alain, and the chicken dances are hilarious - their mime incredibly realistic. I recall they caused quite a stir in the media of the day. On the other hand, despite poor editing, you have the advantages of vastly superior audio/video in the 2005 recording, including a highly dramatic storm scene.",1294012800,4,973,4.903030303030303
3417773,3,B0018MRAZC,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a charming work with wonderful choreography by Frederick Ashton and superb dancing by all principals.  All the more pity that it is spoiled by poor camerawork and excessive cutting!  I had trouble viewing because I was continually recoiling from excessive zooms and cuts to close ups, framing of tops of dancers, not seeing legs, cutting away from the action I wanted to see.  Especially with blu-ray where there is enough definition to see details without close ups, this continual need by the director, Ross MacGibbon, to emphasize what he thought was worth emphasis, was annoying.  I much prefer the version with Lesley Collier and Michael Coleman, conducted by John Lanchbery, which allowed me to view and enjoy without intrusive camerawork and editing!",1281398400,13,799,5.123076923076923

I saw this ballet when I was a kid and I almost had forgotten, that is why I wanted to buy it, to remember. This particular DVD has a pretty good review and that is why I decided to get it.
I am glad that I did it because it is very good.
The quality of all the cast, even the secondary characters are great.
Lise and Colas played by Marianela Nunez and Carlos Acosta are very convincing and graceful in this ballet, in particular ""The dance with the Ribbon"" as well as in the second act when she found him in her house.
The character of Simone was very well done by William Tuckett as well as the rest of the cast.
The costumes, dancing, and scenery were very beautiful representing a real pastoral scene.
The lights were very effective in particular in the tempest scene.
The orquestra was excellent.
This DVD is outstanding and I pretty enjoyed it.",1281139200,3,1006,5.029940119760479

8270137,5,B0018MRAZC,"This is the well known production which Sir F. Ashton did in Covent Garden. Carlos Acosta is the star, for my taste a bit too professional and
missing impulsiveness - but only a bit. Of course he is a brilliant dancer !
Nunez is a charming Lise. Her portraying of the girl fallen in love with Colas is extraordinary. Fantastic solo in the last Action.
The widow Simone could be better due to the fact being danced by a man. There is a missing of humour.
  You can enjoy stage and dancing and also the wonderful romantic
music.",1454284800,,526,4.357142857142857

8270141,5,B0018MRAZC,"An exceedingly pleasing ballet. The production has maximized the potential given the choreography and music. The lead female dancer has done a magnificent job. The other reviewers have done justice and so I will not repeat. The scope of this production though, I must add is not as large as some of the better known ones. I would compare the scope with something like Giselle which in my opinion is not one of the giants.",1418169600,,421,4.626666666666667
