8674879,2,B00MVIYMIA,Not for MS USH students. A shame producers chose to focus on personal lives of the men and not their political contributions. TJ really liking married women after his wife died is not in my state standards for 8th grade. My copy is going in the garbage sadly.,1510876800,,259,4.416666666666667

8674884,1,B00MVIYMIA,"I have The Founding Fathers (which is incorporated in this 2 disc documentary) and loved it, loved the portraits of the human, consequently flawed, men who built this nation.  However, the second disc of Liberty was so offensive to me, as an American who admires and respects the hardships of Valley Forge and the risk of life and property that the revolutionary Americans endured, that I turned it off and tossed the DVD. I would not even pass it on.",1493424000,6,451,4.6375
8674885,5,B00MVIYMIA,"Service quite fast for an overseas delivery thanks. Excellent and inciteful, above average historical presentation. The greatness of the people involved is realistically balanced with faults, quirks, etc. Fine work.",1473379200,,215,6.2
