8202362,5,B000RQ78YI,"Jeff Amsden has an honest approach to dance and lifts...his goal is to help us achieve these highlights, and so he lets us see every moment of the breakdown as well as the results of different timings. I appreciated his advance tips, and those of his carefully chosen partner, who is gorgeous. The breakdowns were clearly illustrated, and my students were able to re-create the lift combinations safely, with practice.
I own many lift videos, but Jeff's is the first one that actually illustrates the breakdown in a way that gives the viewer a path.
