The movie opens with the music of his most successful stage show, ""Show Boat"". The story is told in a flash back, when Kern tells his live history to a cab driver. Melodies from ""Show Boat""
include:

 ""Can't Help Loving Dat Man"" - Lena Horne
 ""Old Man River"" - Choris

The tale continues as Jerome Kern travels back and forth from New York to London where he gets ideas for production numbers,develops a passion for musical comedy and meets Eva Leade whom he marries.

Highlights of Song and Dance numbers are:
""Cleopatterer"" - June Allyson and Ray McDonald
""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" - Cyd Charese and Gower Champion
""I Won't Dance"" - Van Johnson sings and dances with Lucille Bremer.(One of my favorites; I love to watch Van sing and dance)

""All the Things You Are"" - Tony Martin
""Why was I Born?"" - Lena Horne
""Old Man River"" - Frank Sinatra

Hundreds, if not thousands, of artists poured thier musical talents into the making of this musical. If you are a song and dance fan, as I am, willing to take a step or two back to Hollywood's Golden Age of Musicals, slip the DVD in, get comfortabel in your favorite chair, relax and enjoy 135 minutes of sheer entertainment.

I can not say anything unfavorable about the DVD I pucharded from Amazan. It is in good condition, enjoyable to watch and was reasonably priced.
