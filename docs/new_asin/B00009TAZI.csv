7992948,2,B00009TAZI,"I must admit that I had expected more from this DVD. It's not a bad DVD - everything is quite professionally and neatly done - but the material presented is probably not very useful if you are an amateur photographer, i.e. not a total novice.
If you are about to buy your first digital camera, or if you've just bought yourself one, this DVD will definitely fill in some blanks, but if you're expecting very in-depth technical information about digital cameras and digital photography - the stuff you won't find in the manual - then you will likely be a tad disappointed. This is not the learning tool that will take you a significant step closer to being a hard-core professional photographer.",1078444800,6,694,4.69672131147541
7992949,5,B00009TAZI,"This is an excellent dvd that helped me learn much more about considerations and improving results. I have had a digital cam for 4 years and thought I was pretty good, but this is much more complete than others I've seen. I am glad I made the investment, my pics improved immediately. Good job guys, looking forward to Volume 2",1074038400,,327,4.466666666666667
7992950,4,B00009TAZI,I've always been interested in taking photographs. The part I hate is all the technical details and having to read the manuals. There has always been this barrier to understanding how to REALLY use my camera (a Nikon 880) well. It's loaded with features I knew nothing about. I've never taken a class and didn't know an f-stop from an aperture. This DVD certainly helps clear things up a bit and I think my photos are getting better. Can't wait for the next volume!,1058832000,2,465,4.5476190476190474
7992951,5,B00009TAZI,"I've been shooting digital photography for a few years and on the advice of a friend I bought this DVD for my wife who was interested in getting in digital photgraphy. It brought her up to speed on the bascis of how the cameras work and how to use them very quickly, plus I've found a couple of tips to be very helpful in my photography. I would recomend this DVD to anybody getting into digital photography or who has been shooting for a while.",1058659200,3,445,4.247058823529412
7992952,5,B00009TAZI,"Whether or not you own a digital camera, this DVD will put you on the right track to getting the most out of this amazing technology.
I've owned a 35mm Canon (actually two) since I was 16. Yikes, that's 20 years now. When the lens on my EOS Rebel broke last summer I bought a Nikon 995 instead. I can honestly say I've shot more photos since the Nikon purchase than in the prior 19 years.
I spent hours if not days deciding which camera was right for me; and weeks figuring out how to get the most out of it from the manual, books and websites. I wish this DVD was available last summer because it's all here. And the quick tips section has already improved my 'eye'. In fact, if the producer is reading this... how 'bout a DVD of just tips... please.
The quality is great. The information relevant, and way more 'readable' than most books. As a volume 1, I'd recommend this to anyone who's new to the digital side of photography, and curious about what makes it different (and in my opinion better). Then again, the tips on composition alone were worth the 30 bucks. Bring on volume 2.",1057104000,2,1086,4.328431372549019
7992953,5,B00009TAZI,"Four great things about this DVD:
First, it helps you decide on a digital camera before you put down your money. It doesn't recommend a specific camera model, but it helps you understand the features you're likely to find in a range of cameras and decide what's best based on how you intend to use the camera. Then it shows you how to get the most from the features you're likely to have in your new camera.
Second, it has some great sections on how to take different kinds of pictures. A professional photographer gives you tips on how to do action, close-up, landscape, and portrait photography and you see some great examples that are so clear you'll want to go out and try what you've learned.
Then, there's a fantastic section on composition that's like a slide show with critical comments on each picture. This is fun just to sit back and enjoy some beautiful photography.
And finally, this is a true, interactive DVD. It's not like watching some boring how-to TV show! Each lesson is a short chapter only a couple of minutes long. You have instant random access to any chapter and you can skip around and go to the specific topic you want to know more about. This DVD is perfect for someone just starting out with digital photography.",1056067200,8,1241,4.569506726457399
7992954,5,B00009TAZI,"I have been using a digital camera for a few years and many people ask me questions about buying and using a digital camera. This DVD elegantly and concisely answers all of the questions people have when transitioning from film to digital photography. After an hour of viewing somebody can go from a complete novice with digital photography to somebody who has a good background in how digital camera works and how to choose a camera that is right for them. The DVD does not mention specific camera models but only categories of digital cameras - so it gives the viewer a good starting place for shopping for a digital camera.
The DVD also provides some helpful hints for getting great photos. One section provides a critique of good and bad photos, explaining why some photos are more astheically pleasing than others. The viewer learns how to look critically at a photograph.
There are great explanations for concepts such as mega-pixel and image-resolution with great visuals to support the explanations. I am looking forward to volume 2!",1054771200,,1041,4.887005649717514
