8162039,5,B000LKW9VM,Briggitte Bako Is adorable and funny too. The show itself is kind of a clone of Sex and the Citybut it's fun and not a little titilating. I love it.,1521676800,,148,3.966666666666667
8162040,1,B000LKW9VM,"Not even worth watching.  Supposed to be FREE TRIAL, but ended up paying 1.99 for it.  It should be taken off the market.",1413331200,,121,4.217391304347826
8162041,4,B000LKW9VM,"""G-Spot"" is a Canadian series now in its 3rd season, created by, written by, executive produced by, and starring Brigitte Bako.  Seasons 1 and 2 aired in 2005 and 2006 on The Movie Network and Movie Central, so it was available in the U.S. as well as Canada.  Season 3 aired in 2009 only on Showcase (a Canadian network).

""G-Spot"" follows the adventures of actress Gigi (Bako) and her three girlfriends in Hollywood.  There's a fair amount of humor and the usual cable TV nudity (butts and breasts).

The series shows Bako's sense of irony fairly well.  For one example, Gigi lies about her age, having a ""30th"" birthday party when she was supposedly 33.  Of course Gigi is 5 years younger than Bako's real age (42 in 2009).  Brigitte Bako largely made a name for herself in such late-night fare as ""Red Shoe Diaries"", with frequent nudity.  In ""G-Spot"" Gigi has contractual disputes about how much skin she will expose in roles, and decries being hired because of her sex appeal instead of her acting ability -- yet most of Gigi's issues stem from her sexual compulsions.  ""Canadian Content"" protectionism laws are lampooned in ""G-Spot"", but the series is shot in Toronto instead of L.A., in part to take advantage of Canadian tax credits, so the ""Hollywood"" people are mostly Canadian.

There are only 8 half-hour episodes in each season, so there's not a lot of content in this Season 1 DVD collection.  But it's amusing stuff.",1247788800,,1431,4.725806451612903
8162042,4,B000LKW9VM,"So here's another Sex and the City clone,this one featuring hottie Brigitte Bako. She also writes the episodes as well. Season 1 has 8 episodes,each about 30 minutes in length. Though there are only some cast interviews as extras,I still think any show that has the occasional topless scene with Brigitte Bako is worth watching. The show is even funny and for the most part well-acted,though I'd still watch it even if it wasn't.

Although it's Canadian made,it's got a slick enough look to it. If you're a Brigitte Bako fan or would like to watch a much lighter version of Sex and the City about a struggling B-level actress spending time with her girlfriends, while looking for work and men, then give this series a try. The 8 episodes of Season 2 are not yet out on DVD,but I'm hoping the wait for the next DVD will be a short one.",1165881600,3,834,4.4868421052631575
