5073847,5,B007BMIFY8,"Flashpoint was a program introduced to me by my mother after its third season.  Naturally, when I got hooked on it I had to make sure I went back to the beginning to find out how it all began.  Boy, am i glad that I did!  Now, my best friend is getting into it, too, so I'm getting another set for her for Christmas!!!  Give it a watch yourself and find out how good a television show can STILL be!!",1347235200,5,399,3.95
5073848,4,B007BMIFY8,"I love this series! I ordered the four-season pack all at once, something I don't usually do for television shows. Unfortunately, the Season 4 DVD only has about 1/2 the episodes as were done in the season. It leaves off at ""Shockwave"". There are about 10-13 more episodes after Shockwave in the series. I hope there will be another DVD to account for the missing episodes, which were initially aired in late 2011. That might account for them not being on the DVD...

I haven't compared the other three DVDs yet against the episodes list. Once I do, I'll update here to indicate if the earlier DVDs have all the episodes. I know that people who like the show want all the episodes on the DVDs.

Other than that, the episodes are laid out in the US air order, which is slightly different than the original air date in Canada. Aside from the storyline between Ed and Sophie regarding her pregnancy it's not an issue and viewers won't get confused.

UPDATE: All episodes from Seasons 1-3 are present. Only the first seven episodes of Season 4 are included.",1345766400,19,1053,4.590425531914893
5073849,5,B007BMIFY8,The videos arrived promptly and were as advertised. I have to watched all episodes on TV so I cannot tell is some are missing. I appreciate the pricing and delivery and look forward to have this archived set.,1343347200,,208,4.5
5073850,5,B007BMIFY8,"I don't have cable or satellite so I don't see anything when it airs.  I see everything on reruns at night when I'm at work.  As you can imagine I don't see anything in order which is why I buy the DVDs when they are released.  Point being until I started reading the reviews for Flashpoint I didn't realize there were episodes missing from the 4 seasons of the show I purchased.  I really like the show and think the characters are wonderful and story lines are excellent.  I'm hoping Amazon (in conjunction with the company that released these DVDs) are going to re-release the complete season (or at least put the missing episodes on a separate DVD) and make it available at a reasonable price (free would be good).  We're counting on you, Amazon, to make this right.",1340928000,19,770,4.503597122302159
5073851,5,B007BMIFY8,The flashpoint series is as described. I am very satisfied and would reorder the series again for myself or as a gift.,1366329600,,118,4.409090909090909
5073852,5,B007BMIFY8,"My wife and I are big ""Flashpoint"" fans, and having these to watch is terrific. ""Flashpoint"" features great ensemble acting, the story lines are tight and believable, and there's no embarrassing sex scenes and stuff like that, which I've always disliked watching. Awesome show and Christian-safe. NOTE: We ordered season 5 quite a few weeks ago and are planning to investigate. Could be they're not available yet.",1366070400,,413,5.17910447761194

5073854,5,B007BMIFY8,If you don't have 1-4 of Flashpoint get it.  There is only so many that they have on replays on TV.  This is awesome from start to finish!  Well worth the price.

5073856,5,B007BMIFY8,"I love the series. Unfortunately due to my early work schedule and the show airing very late night I am not able to watch it.  This show is filmed in Toronto Canada (my native home) and I enjoy seeing the landmarks and places I have been throughout the city.

5073875,3,B007BMIFY8,"Season Four is not complete! I love this show, but I am pretty disappointed that this set did not make it clear that we were only getting the first 13 episodes of season 4. In this, I feel cheated. Whether the choice of the DVD creator or Amazon, as the seller, Amazon had a responsibility to make it clear that this was NOT the full four seasons. I paid for Seasons 1-4, not seasons 1-3.5.",1357430400,11,390,4.213333333333333
