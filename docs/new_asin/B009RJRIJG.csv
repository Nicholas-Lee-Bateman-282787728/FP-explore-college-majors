5361125,4,B009RJRIJG,"Nothing like a GOOD Blooper Reel, and these are the biggies.
I love seeing Lou Costello crack up Glenn Strange when he's suited up as the mon-
ster in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. There's some classic stuff here,
but some new stuff too -- at least to ME.

I enjoyed ALL the compilations in the series from 2013!",1367193600,9,321,4.440677966101695
5361126,4,B009RJRIJG,"I have a lot of the WB bloopers on here from other sources, but this is the first time I have seen much of this material looking like it is close to the original print source or maybe a negative.  The bloopers from ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN are rather funny, as well.  It is always fascinating to see stars using language we otherwise never hear from them, considering the Production Code at the time.  Definitely worth getting, especially for the price.",1364083200,21,464,4.634146341463414

5361133,2,B009RJRIJG,"BORING!  Don't get me wrong,  I love old Hollywood. I personally own over 3300 films,  and I've got to say I was very disappointed in this DVD. First of all,  the quality is bad. I wasn't expecting perfection,  but was expecting better. Secondly the ""bloopers"" were just boring, very few laughs, lastly the extras were nothing great.
In truth, I wasn't expecting greatness and purchased this on the merit of history. It was nice to c stars without any censorship, but it would have been nice to have some sort of breakdown or presentation.  One take can't watch this any more than 10 minutes or so at a time.  So if u r looking for history -Buy this DVD, but if u r looking for enjoyment- Then skip it,  and buy a great Barbara Stanwyck or Humphrey Bogart film instead.",1447200000,,769,4.442857142857143
5361134,1,B009RJRIJG,Hated this dvd. Not funny just actors forgetting their lines using bad language.,1446336000,,80,5.230769230769231

Also the clips did not identify the movie they were from??",1435795200,,125,4.7272727272727275

5361144,5,B009RJRIJG,"You won't find these playing a lot on movie channels (hbo, Cinemax, show time).  You'll will find it amusing and comical when the stars mess up. Makes them kind of regular folks.",1418947200,2,178,4.5625
5361145,3,B009RJRIJG,"Even the best stars flub a line now and then,,, this DVD shows some of the funny mistakes they made and the reactions they have to their mistakes. Some good laugh out loud moments and a view of your favorite stars as you've never seen them. The Hollywood home movies is OK to a point.",1411344000,2,284,4.181818181818182
5361146,5,B009RJRIJG,I really enjoyed the Bloopers dvd.  It provided me with a lot of laughs and I could remember most of the movies they were on being a huge fan of the classic films of that era.  I especially liked the bonus disc of behind the scenes Hollywood and would recommend this dvd to every fan of movies of the 30's-40's-50's.  Tons of huge box office stars make it a most enjoyabe experience.,1403481600,7,383,4.291666666666667
5361147,2,B009RJRIJG,"This DVD of Classic Bloopers Has NO script to follow. just a bunch of snippets stuck together with no direction or plan. It's not what I call comedy mostly script mistakes or forgotten lines.  Contains a lot of cussing, but, I don't remember if the ""F"" word was used, but almost all the foo-pa's used had  a lot of dammits.  I'm not a prude, I just didn't think this was funny. We're  all human and make mistakes and these Hollywood people are no different than us. Save your money.",1401235200,2,482,4.382022471910112
5361148,5,B009RJRIJG,"Not sure why some folks had negative feedback--but for the adults in my family watching this one, we had a heck of a good time watching some of our favorite film stars goof up!! This one that you just need to kick back and let yourself be entertained-after all, this is the purpose of watching a blooper reel!!Enjoy!!",1395273600,5,317,4.482758620689655
5361149,2,B009RJRIJG,"This was disappointing. Lots of foul language. I already tossed it in the garbage can, as I would not want to pass this off as entertainment.",1395014400,,141,4.461538461538462
5361150,5,B009RJRIJG,"Excellent compilation of bloopers from the classic years of cinema...Nice quality film footage PROBABLY THE BEST I have ever seen considering they are outtakes...They are back to back bloopers without any candy coated hosts...Just 100% PURE BLOOPERS....Also includes the famous earthquake blooper with W.C. FIELDS. ALL the big stars are here and funny as hell!
BOGART, BACALL, CAGNEY, REAGEN, ROBINSON... ERROL FLYNN bloopers from ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD and more...WARNER OLAND as CHARLIE CHAN, ABBOTT and COSTELLO, DANNY KAYE, THE DEAD END KIDS, BOB HOPE, BETTE DAVIS and so many more...A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF BLUNDERS, MISTAKES GOOFS, and crazy stuff. Yes, there is some cursing, but that's one of the best things about it!  Where else do you get to hear COSTELLO tell ABBOTT what he should do!!! If you love bloopers, this is a must have DVD. There are scenes in here that have never been included in any other blooper show...A MUST HAVE DVD THAT YOU WILL WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN!",1386892800,8,986,5.049079754601227
5361151,1,B009RJRIJG,Was a MAJOR disappointment. Wasn't what I thought it would be at all. Thought it would be funny but it wasn't.,1384992000,2,110,4.285714285714286
5361152,1,B009RJRIJG,Could not truly understand what they were saying.  Not well laid out and very little commentary .  There were too many cuts!,1384041600,,124,4.590909090909091
5361153,2,B009RJRIJG,The punch line in each scene was the same.  There just wasn't any real fun to the bloopers.  Could have had bloopers from more noteworthy films.,1379289600,,144,4.5
5361154,5,B009RJRIJG,sometimes the actors now and see what comes out of there mouthsand how they react afterwords it is funny laugh at loud funny,1376438400,3,124,4.434782608695652
5361155,1,B009RJRIJG,"I didn't realize when I bought this that it was full of profanity!  We thought we were going to get a funny family video to watch with lots of our favorite actors.  After 5 minutes, we turned it off and tossed it as it isn't worth returning.",1376179200,5,241,4.1063829787234045
5361156,1,B009RJRIJG,"The ""bloopers"" on this DVD are marginal at best. Would not recommend in any way - I know it didn't cost much, but please - a little quality would be appreciated.",1373932800,3,161,4.225806451612903

8543881,1,B009RJRIJG,"Not what we expected!  Extremely upsetting!
Profuse use of the Lord's name!  In fact, WHY make a collection of these?!!
I wish some mention of this had been made in the description before I bought 2 copies!

8543882,5,B009RJRIJG,Very enjoyable.  Loved it.,1496793600,,26,5.5
8543883,2,B009RJRIJG,"I was so disappointed in this blooper movie that I threw it away. There was way too much cursing God in it. I really thought it would be mistakes that were cute and innocent and funny. As it turns out it was all cursing. It's so sad the world we live in is like that. But for some people it really wouldn't matter about that sort of thing, but it does to me.
There were just a few episodes of truly funny bloopers so I guess that's why I'm giving it the rating I did.",1494288000,,467,3.9263157894736844
8543884,3,B009RJRIJG,mostly old movies unless your a real movie buff you won't recognize them,1486857600,,72,4.615384615384615
8543885,3,B009RJRIJG,"I just got this in the mail and watched it. Instead of being 123 minutes long the main feature is only 67 minutes long. 5 more minutes for the Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein bloopers and near 50 minutes of the special Hollywood Without Makeup feature. I was expecting to see stars ""without makeup"", but you basically get a bunch of home movies.
Worth seeing once, but not great by any means.
Lots of old stars in this one. I doubt the younger generation would know ANY of them.",1481760000,3,482,4.426966292134831
