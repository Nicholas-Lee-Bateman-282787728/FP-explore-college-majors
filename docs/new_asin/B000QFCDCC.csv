2837800,5,B000QFCDCC,I show this video as part of my lesson for teaching latitude and longitude. The children get into following Bill around the world even though it isn't as in depth with the coordinates of what the classes that actually followed him. It is inspiring because many of my students can see where he came from because it is just about the same way where they are living today. They can see and understand how he was supposed to fall down the wrong road. IT also gives the students a chance to see that anything is possible with education and commitment to finish. The students also got to see several different cultures that they may never see. This is an excellent video that I show at the end of the year during the time I try to stengthen their geography skills and inspire them to do their best next year.,1180569600,,802,4.389261744966443

I don't live in North America so I was unaware this gentleman had sailed around the world. As a retired aviator and sailor, Captain Pinkney...Well Done!",1498521600,,314,4.526315789473684
8196059,5,B000QFCDCC,"The video tells an incredible story that captures the excitement, the struggle, and the perseverance of Captain  Pinkney.  A truly inspirational story for all.",1490400000,,159,5.583333333333333
8196060,5,B000QFCDCC,"This is a WONDERFUL movie/true story. My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough,at less than 1 hour in length. I would have gladly watched much more!!!

Inspiring doesn't even come close to how this man's story will touch you. I'm so glad that I took a chance on this DVD when I noted it in the sales section at amazon recently, a real gem.

This is also the kind of story/film that should be shared with younger audiences in schools etc...it goes a long way towards teaching the importance of education, reaching for our goals and dreams and NEVER giving up.

Highly recommended!

8196064,5,B000QFCDCC,I met folks who encountered Bill on his voyages. they all liked him. His video made me like him too.  Good sailing stuff. Almost as good at encouraging folks to want to emulate him as the Pardey's Cruising has No Limits DVD.,1261353600,,224,4.333333333333333
8196065,5,B000QFCDCC,"I also teach Open Court -1st grade.  I was extremely excited to find this on DVD.  My 6-year old urban children were mesmerized by the story - we read our OCR story in chunks, viewed the DVD in 10 - 12 minute chunks.  I added realia ( I have a wooden sailboat I purchased) - and had amazing classroom discussions.  The video has a lot of complex language, and you need to view it yourself before showing to your class.  Adding realia, using the globe and map and simplifying some of the terms used - provided a rich learning experience for my students.  I WISH more of OCR non- fiction could be taught using video AND the book...the students were super engaged...and if you go to Open Court [...] - Print out the visual vocabulary...You're all set!!!  I used a portion of this lesson for my National Board Entry.  I was proud of how my students conversed about their ""Captain Bill!!""",1237680000,,883,4.440993788819876
8196066,5,B000QFCDCC,"In the first grade Open Court series, this story is told.  I ordered the DVD and showed it to the first graders in segments.  While I believe this exposure is necessary, I am not sure a six year old has developed an understanding to comprehend the impact this man has on their world.  I shared it with the sixth grade teachers and they are incorporating the video into their library.  Will I use it next year?  Definitely.  I think this is a wonderful asset to any school library.",1235433600,,480,4.3977272727272725

The classical definition of a HERO is one who goes on a journey and returns to share the enlightenment.
Bill Pinkney is a true HERO.",1217808000,2,229,4.181818181818182
