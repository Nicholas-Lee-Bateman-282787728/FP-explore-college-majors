8075547,3,B000A7DW80,"Judging by the box and printing on the CD you would think this was a wild gay sex comedy, but that is far from the case. This film is a small little tragi-comedy about a young man and his grandmother, debating the challenges of what to do with his late mother's cremated remains. There are other gay characters in the film, including an older boyfriend and new young housekeeper, but they are not the main focus of this film.

A sweet little film about family dynamics, presented warts and all, but not the rollicking sex comedy that the packaging proposes.",1141084800,8,557,4.57
