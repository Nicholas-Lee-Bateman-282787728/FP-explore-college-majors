2854378,5,B000QYGOBE,"I received my DVD on March 25th and I couldn't wait to put my hands on it and watch it, which I did. It did not disappoint me as the audio and video were up to my expectations considering this is an old movie recovered from VHS format. I enjoyed very much watching it and will be watching the extras as soon as I can. At least two scenes were dangling from my early memories as a very little child when I saw a few pieces of the movie: the radar screens and the pilots wife in her bed when she felt her husbands presence after he died. You might ask where I had the chance to see those scenes, which I believe it was actually my dad who was likely watching the movie in a then state-owned television channel in mexican TV. How did they get the permissions to show it in mexican TV? I don't know, but I was pretty sure that I had seen at least two scenes even though I don't remember the year Cant recall that at all, plus it might have very likely been dubbed to Spanish or with Spanish subtitles for those of us who didn't speak a word of English at that time.

My dad had John G. Fullers book (also translated into Spanish) which captivated me as a child and read it from beginning to end. Well, I just wanted to share that with you since this story takes me to my early childhood and thats why I wanted to have the movie and watch it again so badly, now with fully comprehension. Definitely worth buying it",1427673600,5,1409,4.105072463768116
2854379,5,B000QYGOBE,Awesome seller!!! Very accommodating and helpful!  Movie is an excellent quality copy. Highly recommended!,1423440000,,106,6.571428571428571
2854380,5,B000QYGOBE,"Ernest Borgnine and Kim Basinger give excellent performances and the story is based on the Book by John Fuller.  It wasonly shown once on NBC's BIG PICTURE in 1978 and never released for distribution.  Quality of the movie is not perfect but since it is not available anywhere, it is viewable and a MUST for the collector of paranormal TRUE STORIES.",1401321600,11,349,4.704918032786885
2854381,1,B000QYGOBE,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!  DO NOT, DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY ON THIS SO CALLED ""EUROPEAN PRINT.""
IT'S PURE DREK!!!!  WHAT YOU WILL GET IS A DVD THAT DOESN'T PLAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH, THE
SCENES ARE VERY DARK AND GRAINY.  IT WAS COPIED OFF OF AN OLD, BAD TRACKING VHS, OR BETA TAPE.
WAIT UNTIL PARAMOUNT DECIDES TO RELEASE THIS.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!",1369008000,11,342,4.296875
2854382,3,B000QYGOBE,I didn't know this was a copy of the movie. It looked like it was recorded from TV or something. The disk didn't have a label and the picture quality was poor.,1347148800,5,159,4.0
2854383,5,B000QYGOBE,"I typed up this title just by chance and was surprised that it is now being offered in DVD format; but I have a question. What does Import mean?
I'm somewhat confused. Does it mean it's not in English at all--or what?
But at any rate, Ghost of Flight 401 is chugging its way into the DVD world, slow but sure.
Years ago, it was on TV twice & I watched it both times; great movie. Had a great cast as well. I did a quick check, at the moment, this movie is not on VHS Format, but there is a off-shoot movie starring William Shatner, titled, The Crash of Flight 401. And at the moment, this movie is not avaible on DVD. I covered all the bases with both movies. Too bad we can't get both as a set on DVD; hopefully in the near future.

P.A. Gross",1202342400,12,744,3.9932885906040267

Along w/ his crew, including Russell Johnson (IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, THIS ISLAND EARTH, HORROR AT 37,000 FEET), Howard Hesseman (TARANTULAS: THE DEADLY CARGO),  and ultra-perky stewardess Kim Bassinger (BATMAN), they take off w/ very few passengers. Almost immediately, something goes wrong w/ the plane. >> MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!! >> Soon, disaster strikes, as the plane crashes in the Everglades. A rescue and recovery mission gets underway. Dom is among the survivors, but can't be saved. This is where things get spooky! Everyone starts smelling Dom's favorite cologne in the air! Strange stories about the stored parts of FLIGHT 401 begin circulating! People claim to see Dom's ghost on various flights! The woo-woo factor skyrockets!
