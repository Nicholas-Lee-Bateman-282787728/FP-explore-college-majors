8200709,4,B00005RCG8,"First off, I haven't been into Hammerfall all that long, maybe a year or two. I own two Hammerfall CD's {Legacy / Crimson}. This DVD is very good IMO. It's got a little bit of everything...

It's not your perfect DVD as far as production is concerned, but what's inside makes it very enjoyable. I also think some of the low production ""home video feel"" is what makes it so cool. It's got plenty of average to excellent live footage, and behind the scenes stuff while on tour, which is very cool in my opinion...

Some special, and most surprising footage of the late ""FATHER OF DEATH METAL"" Chuck Schuldiner himself. Very special and most deserving I must say. I am also a hugh Death fan, and the loss of Chuck was a big one inside the world of Metal. It was very cool to see him on home video having fun behind the scenes....RIP CHUCK!!!

I think this is a very cool DVD. Hammerfall are a very talented live band, and this proves it. On stage, they kind of brought back some old great memmories of Iron Maiden.

What I liked the most about this DVD is that it gives you an up close and personal feel with band members. I don't consider Hammerfall the best Heavy Metal band around, but they can certainly hold their own. Check it out....I was impressed...",1038009600,4,1255,4.373390557939914
8200710,4,B00005RCG8,"Well to be quite honest, I have seen higher quality Concert/Documentary DVDs then this one, but Hammerfall still takes home Four stars from me.  Personally I found the DVDs set list to be quite well rounded (songs from 'Glory to the Brave' to 'Renegade' are played) and even the Hammerfall versions of 'I Want out' (sung with Kai Hansen) and 'Breaking the Law' (with a special line up) make an appearance on the DVD.  Whats more 'Heeding the Call' has been redone in an acoustic format (which sounds pretty cool i think)
I must say that the guys at Hammerfall are not only great musicians, but are quite funny too (demonstrated by their antics and even more so in the outtakes).  The DVD has something for everyone and will certainly at some points make you laugh.",1037318400,2,764,4.602941176470588
8200711,3,B00005RCG8,"The dvd has a good material, but it seems hammerfall and producers didn't wanted to keep the METAL in a good shape, but to express it through a low fidelity dvd. The dvd doesn't even have a Stereo Dolby sorround but a poor LCM Stereo, and a excesively beginer video style, with a sony handycam cuality, and a single camera shooting the set.
 Its fun to see them play and the concerts and the shows they manage to set. great material but a clear bad organization, and budget.",1036108800,2,474,4.386363636363637
