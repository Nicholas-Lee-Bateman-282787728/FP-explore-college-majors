8266488,3,B0017LZ1ZK,"This documentary discusses when and how the Japanese used kamikaze during World War II.  The subject fascinates me because there are so many taboos against suicide in the West that it almost seems unfathomable that any other region would support it.

This was a decent documentary.  I just wish I could have seen woodblock paintings and kimonos and stuff.  I would like to know generally why Japan is comfortable with suicide.  However, this focuses only on the war.  It's all black-and-white film footage.  The narrator mispronounces things (as far as I know) too.

It turns out that kamikaze was used as a last resource.  Only those soldiers willing to do it were invited to do so.  The work continually tells how inefficient it was.  You see footage after footage of Japanese planes that don't do one bit of damage to their Allied targets.  There's a book called ""What's Love Got to Do with It?"" about Dominican streetwalkers who struggle to get visas to Germany.  The author points out that many people who accomplish this dream goal oftentimes don't like Germany for one reason or another and come back to the island.  I was thinking about that here.  When folk speak of kamikazes, it's usually with a tone of fear or dread.  Here the tactic itself is presented as dumb and ineffective, a poor, last-ditch effort.

This is the type of work that History Channel would show.  Those who love learning everything about the 1940s war will enjoy seeing this.",1264723200,,1457,4.783132530120482
