8634132,5,B00HPXG28E,"I love Bollywood movies, and this is now one of my favorites.  Sunny Deol is great as Sing Saab.  He portrayed a similar charater in Pagla, Ramla, Dewanna and his three co-stars in that movie also have a cameo appearance in Singh Saab the Great.  It's an action packed Indian super hero movie and I hope Sunny Deol does more of them.  I'd love to see a sequel to Singh Saab the Great.",1504137600,,384,4.219178082191781
