2175030,4,B000683VHA,This movie is a fatal attraction drama between guys in the corporate world and just about as good as the original classic movie.,1512950400,,128,4.608695652173913
2175031,4,B000683VHA,"Okay, so the plot is pretty ridiculous. Reminds of something from the 1970s. Predictable as hell. I gave it 4 stars because Christian Slater kept me entertained as a somewhat funny manic nut-job. Remember Ty Pennington, the hyperactive host of the Extreme Home Makeover series? Yeah, he was like that guy on crack, only psychotic.",1511740800,,330,5.0181818181818185
2175032,1,B000683VHA,Save yourself the agony. This film could have easily destroyed the careers of all involved.,1510790400,,91,5.133333333333334
2175033,4,B000683VHA,"This Movie is about a Psychotic Head Hunter who Will Not Take ""No"" for an answer & who resolves to Stalking. Harassing & Even Murder.  It seems far fetched but Christian Slater is the Villain here.  Christian has acted the part well.",1510617600,,233,4.523809523809524
2175034,4,B000683VHA,"While the plausibility of this movie is in question...  as long as you take it within movie context, I thought it did a decent job...  acting was good...  camera work was good...  suspense was good...  I don't think there are any real twists or turns, but overall it's a pretty decent suspense flick...  probably more a 3.5 ( technically ), but I'll round up to a 4 because I was entertained throughout...

( is there some bizarre reason lots of people on here rate stuff 1 or 5?  I only give 1 ratings to truly truly gawd awful flicks...  and only 5 to movies where I think...  oh man, I need to watch again like asap!...  anyway )

The movie isn't perfect by any means, but it's fun and suspenseful...  so, if you are bored and want to watch a slightly older ""stalker"" / ""pseudo-corp espionage"" flick...  go for it...",1510617600,,819,4.373333333333333
2175035,5,B000683VHA,Surprisingly fresh. Really enjoyed this movie.  Highly recommend.,1507161600,,65,7.125
2175036,1,B000683VHA,"Unbelievable; but well portrayed by Christian Slater & Gil Bellows--in the corporate world of fiction. As well-acted out as this film was, it just didn't keep me entertained enough to give it more than one star & I watched it all the way through. Slater's character broke crime-rules including murder, harassment, stalking, just to name three=mental hospital patient would have been a better role in this film. Sorry, but not sorry for the one star.",1507075200,,449,5.0

2175052,5,B000683VHA,"Christian Slater is great in this movie!  Saw this movie a long time ago, and just had to have
a copy of it for myself.  Great movie, you won't be disappointed.",1394582400,,160,4.129032258064516
2175053,5,B000683VHA,"A wonderful film with a star performance by actor Christian Slater(Heathers, True Romance, Soldiers Of Fortune, etc) as well as his co-stars. A real thrill ride! Would recommend for anyone seeking a film with plenty of on the edge of your seat moments.",1355184000,,252,4.883720930232558
2175054,3,B000683VHA,"Would think that usually it's the other way around in real life, that someone looking for work would be stalking a headhunter or boss of a good company to get them hired, yet this movie was just the opposite.  Overall it was not too bad, kept my attention well throughout the movie and was quite suspenseful.  Worth a watch if you enjoy corporate/office suspense films.

2175055,4,B000683VHA,"Christian Slater plays the corporate headhunter 'Vincent Palmer' who is so relentless and obsessed at keeping his record of 'always getting his man' that he'll stoop to murder to get the job done. When this pill popping nightmare pursues family man Ben Keats, the game gets very ugly. A different type of thriller with a unique type of 'stalker'.

2175056,3,B000683VHA,"...this movie is being written about on this site.  The script for the movie was pretty bad and the storyline was also poorly written. Christian is a great actor though and the mere fact that he was in this film, made it viewable.  Christian plays a headhunter who is absolutely ruthless as he hunts down his

pray.  He even involves the persons immediate family by sending them presents etc.  In other words, he just will not give up until they sign the dotted line.",1149897600,,467,4.511904761904762
2175057,2,B000683VHA,"'Pursued' is a typical Canadian direct-to-video film with one interesting idea in its center, which is ruined by the inept direction.  I know the fans of Christian Slater might look at it differently, but for me watching this horrible thriller turned out one of the most painful experiences.  I believe even some of Slater's fans might have felt the same way.

Slater plays a baddie here. He is Vincent Palmer, one of the top corporate headhunter who won't take no for an answer. He wants Ben Keats (Gil Bellows), who invented a revolutionary GPS system, so Vincent uses everything to recruit him. I mean, EVERYTHING.

Even if you don't know the world of executive recruiters (and I don't either), you are going to find Vincent Palmer and his bahaviors so incredible and preposterous. He starts with frequent phone calls, then sending presents, next spying on Keats and his family with monitors, and look! the guy shows up everywhere! Usually what Vincent does is called stalking, but none of the Keats notices this guy played by overacting Slater with menacing eyes is in fact a dangerous man until the very last moment.

What kind of company do you think would hire this dangerous guy with psychotic behaviors, whose dubious reputation can be easily detected on the internet? What kind of police, especially police of Seattle where this film is set, can allow this guy do whatever he wants when there are lots of (yes, lots of ) physical evidence that point to him? Like the PCs in the deserted warehouse? Like the forged signs?  Like...

Besides too many plot holes, the acting is so-so at best.  In addition to over-the-top Slater and Bellows, Estella Warren and Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan appear.  Estella Warren is not much different from her in 'Driven' and 'Planet of the Apes,' and even Michael Clarke Duncan looks as if he does not know what to do in this mess.

'Pursued' and 'Alone in the Dark.' Two of these recent Christian Slater films can easily kill the career, or maybe already did.  What ever happened to him?",1131753600,,2037,4.7749287749287745
2175058,4,B000683VHA,"The idea of casting usual all-American Christian Slater as a deadly psychotic corporate headhunter was inspired, and although PURSUED ultimately falls apart by the end, it's an entertaining little thriller.  Slater plays a headhunter who goes to extremes to ensure that the people he's hunting take the jobs they are offered.  His latest target is played by Gil Bellows; Bellows is a computer whiz who has developed a computer chip that when embedded in a person's bloodstream will enable them to be traced.  This would be extremely beneficial in tracking missing persons, for instance.  Bellows, however, turns down Slater's job offer and that's when all hell breaks loose.  Slater stalks him and his family, endearing himself to both Bellows' wife and young daughter, and a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues.

Slater is devilishly fun in his role, but Bellows seems in a daze most of the time and a stronger performer might have made the whole game more intriguing.  Slater is definitely better in this than the recent ALONE IN THE DARK.",1121558400,,1041,4.948275862068965
2175059,3,B000683VHA,"You know this started really good, Christian Slater gives a pretty good performance but by the end I am left feeling like I am watching a made for TV Movie.. Regular fight suspense at the end could have went a little more the Firm. They used technology in it which could have went a little more Enemy of the State. They used a throw away performance as the guy that helps the pursued just to get him killed and extend the time of the film, mabe they should have spent more time developing the ending story caused I really like the theme..",1103846400,,538,4.284313725490196
2175060,4,B000683VHA,Christian Slater and Gil Bellows are terrific in this fast paced thriller. I enjoyed every minute right to the action packed finale.  Christian Slater gives a performance as good as any he's had and shows he can still deliver. I recommend to all.,1103673600,,246,4.72093023255814
8040051,4,B000683VHA,This film creates tension as a psychotic head hunter goes to sickening lengths to recruit top talent for ruthless corporations. Slater is perfect casting for the manic head hunter who will not fail regardless of the depths he has to sink to. A tech genius gets caught up in this game through no fault of his own and his intelligence and steadfast loyalty to his family gives him the courage to fight. Good cast and entertaining. Recommended.,1515801600,,441,4.740259740259741

8040055,3,B000683VHA,I fell asleep almost immediately. A man having that much ability to stalk another man and literally never take no for an answer just wasn't believable  enough to keep my attention.,1514592000,,180,4.806451612903226
8040056,3,B000683VHA,"So appropriate to see Christian Slater of fsociety hacker fame in this film.  Moving on from his ""Mr Robot"" family attacks against computers (which no sentient human should ever have trusted in the first place), Slater gets into brutal hacking of human relationships (which most people do trust however irrationally).  Adding such antihuman hacking onto the already dangerous criminal schemes of felonious enslavement to the divorce racketeering industry euphemized as ""marriage"" by the felony tax evading ""religion"" gangs creates intolerable pressures on mere humans,  The immediate target of the antihuman hacking is faced with accepting the hacker's rigged ""job offer"" or of killing the hacker.  Joins forces with a security consultant to inspect the hacker's headquarters then follows the hacker to the hacker's murder of the primary financial backer of the target's business.  Hacker shows up at the funeral and then presents himself as a the target's attorney when the target is arrested for physically assaulting the hacker at the backer's funeral.  Hacker shoots the security consultant near the target's loading dock but ultimately loses the gun fight and violent struggle in the warehouse with the target.  Original target winds up with his own firm in a successful office building.  Credible acting by the participants kept this dreary story at a three star rating.",1514246400,,1376,5.397196261682243
