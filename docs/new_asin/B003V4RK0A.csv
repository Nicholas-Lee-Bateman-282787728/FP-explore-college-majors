4208095,5,B003V4RK0A,"a simply brilliant present day blowing away the cobwebs yet maintaining the full integrity of the text  performance from start to finish - for apart from magnificent singing and superb orchestral playing the acting and characterisation throughout are so carefully delineated that the whole becomes a superlative psychological exploration which allows the foibles and foolishness of the characters to be seen at full value without our losing sympathy for the dilemma in which they find themselves:

the six principals are everything one could hope for, the stunning puppet-master Don Alfonso presented  by Bo Skovhus is the performance I've been waiting for for more than 40 years;  Patricia Petibon's Despina is very much working class with every on-stage reason to be contemptuous of her foolish employers, taking every opportunity to manipulate them into the inevitable love-games, and again hers is a performance which will stand the test of time for ages to come:  the two sisters, the magnificent Miah Persson at her exquisite best as the would-be-hold-out tormented Fiordiligi and the relative newcomer Isabel Leonard as the more susceptible Dorabella are ravishing, musically and physically, and work wonderfully well with/off each other;  the deflated braggadocio of the lovers is superbly handled, the supposedly-triumphant swaggering male assumptions at its foolish comedic best rapidly turns into genuine pain and bewilderment thanks to the wonderful interplay between Florian Boesch's Gugliemo and Topi Lehtpuu's Ferrando, again a pairing that could hardly be bettered

at the heart of this triumph lies the subtle direction of Claus Guth (yes, subtle, despite the occasional video lapses, one shockingly apt over the top moment for Despina perfectly understandable given the situation and character, and lack of disguises Mozart calls for) with exquisite tiny silent moments of interplay between all the characters, supported by the loving video direction of a Brian Large at his very best

this a lovely complement and (raunchier) contrast to the 1988 romantic comedy of manners version from Ponnelle/Harnoncourt and the interesting Sellars diner presentation of 1990 but outshines them both (and puts the very poorly staged and amateur filming of the 2007 Glyndebourne/Hytner production which undermined the fine work of the four lovers into the shade where it so firmly belongs)

to conclude, if I were allowed just one operatic dvd in my collection this would be it by a glorious golden mile",1285718400,26,2508,5.443298969072165
8406359,3,B003V4RK0A,"The only problem I have with this production is the suicide attempt by Fiordiligi  at the end of second act. I do not believe this is in the libretto.
Fiordiligi, despite her poor judgement to engage in a sexual activity with Ferrando (her sister fiance), she was a strong woman capable of dealing with traumatic emotions. Remember that she was hard as rock (come scoglio).

8406360,4,B003V4RK0A,"Here, from the 2009 Salzburg Festival, comes this chamber-sized version of the last of the three great operas that Mozart composed in collaboration with librettist Lorenzo da Ponte.  In a nutshell, I am of the camp that views *Cos fan tutte* as one of Mozart's most sophisticated and wondrous compositions. In some ways this opera succeeds, musically and theatrically, where Mozart's other two da Ponte operas may tend to stumble.  Wow, I can't believe I just wrote that!  What I mean is, I've never seen a production of Don Giovanni, nor can I imagine one, that has presented a clear view of the central character.  The problem with Don Giovanni, then, begins with its title.  I mean, what do we really know about him?  Is Leporello reliable?  That seems improbable, even by standards of 18th century Italian opera.  So if not thousands of conquests, then surely it's a lot, right?  I'm not so sure.  After all, there really isn't any evidence of it in the actual opera, outside Leporello's imagination.  If he's a rake, he isn't a very good one. He doesn't succeed at seducing anyone during the time span covered by the opera.  And what about these women? Is Don Giovanni really so wicked as to deserve death-followed-by-eternal-damnation?  Similarly, in The Marriage of Figaro, what most obviously *doesn't* happen?  Answer: The Marriage of Figaro. In fact, it's another marriage altogether that is the subject of that opera.  Count Almaviva seems to be a different kind of aristocratic lecher than Don G., but his lust is the more pedestrian for being the more specific and within-reach, so to speak.  In Don Giovanni, the hopelessly clumsy would-be hedonist is dragged down to hell without ever even having come close to seducing anyone the audience knows about.  So what is Almaviva's punishment for being the sort of man who doesn't think it's rape so long as it's one of the servants?  Nothing!  He's forgiven!  These are obviously obstacles that can be resolved in good productions.  More often they are just ignored.  Cosi fan tutte, on the other hand, has a much more manageable story.  It's a story about the poverty of good manners, and the differences between what the heart tells us it wants, and what it really wants.  It's a subversive little drammedy that, beneath its fragile surface, is much more profound than the Rococo I Love Lucy that audiences have come, at least until recently, to expect.  *Cos*, then, is a masterpiece that really shines when both the musical and theatrical challenges are attended to.  This production, fresh and young as it is, leaves something to be desired in both arenas.

First, the most positive aspect of this disc: the music.  Well, it is Mozart, after all, and this is the Vienna Philharmonic.  Sort of. The orchestra here is ""The Vienna Philharmonic"", but don't expect big-band Mozart, such as used to be the norm around 40-50 years ago.  There are lots of reviewers on this site who seem to wish that time had stopped back then, but, thankfully it did not, and no matter where you hear it these days, Mozart is usually managed with smaller forces than when I was a kid.  That is not just because ""HIP"" and what-hav- you.  It's because the music sounds better with smaller forces.  Things can be heard that used to get swallowed up by big swanky all-male orchestras.  And in any case, it does no good to be overly nostalgic about this sort of thing because you just aren't going to hear it that way anymore.  The singers here also defy easy classification.  There used to be such things as lyric sopranos and spinto sopranos, and it used to be the case that if you wanted to remember whether a fellow was a bass or a baritone, in most cases, you just had to refer to the liner notes.  That way of singing seems also to be a thing of the past.  Miah Persson may be one of the great Mozart sopranos in the world today.  Ditto Topi Lehtipuu and Florian Boesch.  Moreover, they really look good on stage.  I'm not a person that requires physical beauty from opera singers.  But if they have great voices AND they look good in a little black dress, all the better.  And everyone in the small ensemble here is easy on the eyes.  The two principle women, in particular, are both first class beauties, and all the men cut dashing figures.  So if it's important to you, this production is very user friendly when in comes to pretty people with pretty voices.  The thing is, both Persson and Lehtipuu did it better at Glyndbourne (linked below), and that is available on BD and DVD, so it's harder to make a case for this one than it probably should be.

In addition to everyone looking spectacular and singing at an amazingly high level of expertise (this must be very hard music to organize - the ensembles are devilishly complex), the production seems to be the product of a careful and thoughtful re-vision of the basic conceit (two young men trick their lovers into fianc - swapping to win a bet, except they don't win the bet...).  I am not a person that eschews modern productions.  I think it's good for opera that it at least reach out to the culture at large and not be so insular.  Opera must justify itself or die.  I can testify that this is true.  I live in NYC, and a great cultural landmark, the New York City Opera, just recently folded because it couldn't generate enough interest anymore to pay the rent.  But opera has always had this job.  It was born an elitist art form (the first through-composed opera, Peri's Dafne, has not survived, but it was put together for the coronation party of a monarch; the oldest opera to survive, L'Orfeo by Monteverdi, was composed for a nobleman and his circle of friends, a sort of all-male Italian pre-Masonic lodge called L'Accademia delgli Invaghiti (not really translatable), and even that exclusive group were supplied with copies of the libretto and arguments to explain why the actors were singing, instead of speaking, to one another.  The point is, opera doesn't work like ordinary theater.  Things happen at a different pace.  Time is measured, not by clocks, but by music.  And yet, the actors are still burdened with communicating a story, a narrative idea that the audience will be able to grasp, it is hoped.  The production here makes a case for itself, but, like a ballet where the pantomime is too complex for the audience to understand, there are unanswered and perhaps unanswerable questions here (just one: in exactly what way, one wonders, is the concept of ""disguise"", actually substituted for something else here, and if so, what is it?).  Still, the stage is fresh, the actor/singers look terrific and relaxed, and combined with the mostly first-rate music-making, suffice it to say, you could do worse than go with this production.  But you could also do better.

So what's wrong with it? First of all, while each of these singers is terrific, both Persson and Lehtipuu appear in another Cos that was made a couple of years prior to this one at Glyndbourne, and they are both in much better voice in that production.  Happily, that production is also available on BLU-RAY/DVD here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Cosi-fan-Tutte/dp/B000NIWI9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Cosi fan Tutte</a>.  Isabel Leonard is fine, and really really attractive, both just standing there, and also as an actress.  But she's the weakest link here, I'm afraid.  Patricia Petibon's Despina is terrific, but the way the story is told here, it's hard to know exactly what she's thinking, or why she's doing all that she's doing.  Bo Skovhus, as Don Alfonso, is a mystery.  It would appear that, if you could figure out what he's up to in this production, you could figure the whole thing out.  Sadly, he just isn't allowed to let us, the audience, in on the joke.  Don Alfonso's character is actually a problem, no matter what.  Is he a cynical villain, some kind of sorcerer like Klingsor or Sarastro, perhaps, or is he just a buffo character without much motivation other than that of being needed to push the story along.  Alas, there are no answers, and no printed materials accompanying the disc to explain. Secondly, where the Glyndbourne is a somewhat traditional approach, this is an interventionist production that modernizes the story.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I actually prefer it when someone takes opera audiences seriously enough to try to give them something new when they go to the trouble and expense of going to the opera.  In fact, I think it's vital.  But when a production aspires to be something new, it acquires new responsibilities.  In a traditional production, where there are lacunae, you just chalk it up to ""clunky libretto"" or whatever.  In an updated production, the libretto's difficulties are still there, and now there is a whole new set of problems that need solving for the audience.  When this works, it can have a shattering effect.  A very good recent example is David McVicar's Rigoletto for Covent Garden, available on DVD here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Rigoletto-David-McVicar-Royal-Opera-House/dp/B001URA638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Rigoletto / David McVicar, Royal Opera House</a>.  This Cosi, however, is a failure in that regard.  Another reviewer correctly pointed out the problem of disguise in this production.  The plot turns on it (as do most of the plots in Mozart's operas to one degree or another).  But here, the actors are only in disguise part of the time.  Possibly related to this are the sometimes bizarre gestures that the actors use throughout.  I had a feeling that we were supposed to understand Don Alfonso (sung/played by the now veteran Mozart specialist, Bo Skovhus) as being some kind of sorcerer or hypnotist.  Why?  I have no idea, but his strange gyrations and the consequent (subsequent?) reactions by the actors to these gestures support this notion.  Anyway, whatever the point is, it didn't work because no one seems to have a clue as to what it is.  Answers are not provided, incidentally, in any accompanying printed matter and there are no interviews or other bonuses in this set.  The only clue is a remark that the production, designed by Claus Guth, is consistent with the other two Mozart/da Ponte operas produced at the same time as this.  Question mark.

But never mind all that because you don't have to.  The Glyndbourne production, as of this writing, is in stock and in the same general price range.  Unfortunately that production doesn't have the musically sublime Guglielmo of Florian Boesch, but it has another almost as good.  Plus Persson and Lehtipuu are both in better voice and, well, even two years younger on the Glyndbourne disc.  That's a special plus in this opera which, in my view, really only begins to make sense when you imaging the 4 lovers as being not too far from teenagers.

So yes, this is a pretty good disc, despite the production's abject failure.  I'd rather see someone try something hard and fail, than fall back on easy conventions, especially the one that seems to take for granted that, if you have good singers, you needn't worry about anything so trivial as trying to find a theatrical experience in opera.  And while I do think Herr Guth failed here, I commend the whole company for trying.",1398384000,6,11347,4.882845188284519
8406361,5,B003V4RK0A,"Cosi fan tutte is too often staged as a light romantic tale; this version thankfully takes the music seriously. The women are made to look young all right, but at least not teenage for the most part. It is not just the characters' inexperience that does them in; it is their humanity. Cosi is, as Nikolaus Harnoncourt pointed out some time ago, a comedy borne of desperation. This comes through here. Visually, Claus Guth's composition and lighting are often razor-sharp, although I do wish that someone had insisted on markedly less action on stage. Guth micromanages the music at times and he cannot resist doing one character in the colors of a candy-shop. But the other protagonists are allowed to offer tightrope human drama, and they do. Other reviewers rave about the good looks of the ladies; I add that the gents look just as attractive.

This is a winning combination of intelligent staging, excellent acting, and first-rate music-making.",1384473600,,948,4.962264150943396
8406362,5,B003V4RK0A,"This was great. Usually, the opera singers are huge, too old, fat, and do not know how to act. And the staging  is either too minimalist and dark, or else full of clatter and mock period everything.
This time, not only the music and the voices are great; the setting is wide and uncluttered, but easy to turn into inside-outside, a living room, a pier, And the singers  not only sing beautifully, but are delectable to watch. Especially Bo Skovhus  as Don Alfonso, ; I could not take my eyes off him, even when he just listened to the others.  Patricia Petibon plays a great Despina, in spite of a few ""outr"" short sequences, which, of course, one has come to expect of her.  Miah Person as Fiordiligi, and Isabel Leonard as Dorabella have beautiful voices, and look great, and one feels for them.
 And the ""boys"", Florian Boesch as Guigliemo and Topi Lehtipuu as Ferrando, are no less delectable.
What was great for me in this, was the end; I have always had my suspicions about how , after what had happened, the two couples were going to be able to  go back to things as they were before. An here you see that suspicion in plain sight.

I strongly recommend this .",1375488000,2,1167,4.420560747663552

8406364,4,B003V4RK0A,"I find myself in only partial agreement with the earlier reviewers of the
Vienna Philharmonic version of ""Cosi"".  The music, both vocal and
orchestral is marvellous and even a septuagenarian such as myself
is not yet deaf or blind enough to to be immune to the many charms of
Miah Persson and Isabel Leonard.  But I continue to rate the Glyndebourne
version of ""Cosi"" above this one.  It has, of course, two of the same principals.
In the Glyndebourne version Miah Persson is totally enthralling, absolutely
""purring"" through her best solo parts.  She remains incomparable but not
quite so mesmerizing in the VP version.

I feel that the new version does not do justice to Patricia Pettibon in the role of Despina;
especially not in comparison with the fantastic performance of Ainhoa Garmendia in
the Glyndebourne version, wherein she renders the ""Doctor"" and the ""Notary"" as a
comedic tour de force one never forgets.

Most of all, however, I can't deal with the libretto in the context of VP's modernist version.
It is totally anachronistic in mode of expression; unimaginable as part of 20th or 21st
century conversations/dialogs.  Men casting aspersions on female fidelity may have
been a believable part of 18th or 19th century fictions on the subject but are rendered
nonsensical in a 20th or 21st century setting where parity in such peccadillos is generally
acknowledged.  Of course it remains fun to listen to.  But it is equally fun to listen to in the
more classical context where it is more consistent with societal norms of the time.

I know that Opera in general has to struggle to connect with and attract a younger audience.
But I don't think wrenching great operas from one time to fit another time is part of the answer
to that challenge.  Leave them in their classical glory and complement them with newer works
of comparable merit.  I think Leonard Bernstein was at least pointing us in that direction in
""West Side Story"" and one has no difficulty in imagining operatic counterparts of much that
appears on and off Broadway if only we could generate another Mozart, or even a Donizetti.",1348358400,4,2108,4.85754189944134
8406365,3,B003V4RK0A,"Production has attractive cast, especially Miah Persson & Isabel Leonard ( who made spectacular debut in Romeo & Juliette w/the Tourterelle Aria). Persson is trully an accomplished Soprano & Leonard while not as accomplished is headed for a brilliant Opera career.

Bo Skovhus occupied too much space as Don Alfonso and I think he upset overall balance of Opera. Also the modern aspect of the production took away from the Pathos which is always my favorite part of a Mozart Opera. This gave the production a shallow feeling. I much prefer the Drottningholm 1984 production DVD. But this production is worth buying and is fun in its way.",1344902400,3,637,4.898148148148148
8406366,5,B003V4RK0A,"This production is not as radical (or entirely consistent) a re-think as Guth's ""Figaro"", but it's definitely not traditional. Alfonso is a sort of ""puppet master"", controlling events physically as well as persuasively. Interestingly a couple of lines of recit in Act II were cut, eliminating Despina's suggestions to Don Alfonso and making their relationship as one-way as Alfonso's relationship with everyone else. The performances from all quarters, singers and pit alike, are outstanding. My one complaint is that Patricia Petibon hams it up a little too much - perhaps overcompensating for an otherwise very dark take on the work. Otherwise all the singers really inhabit their roles and draw the viewer into the inhumane scenario that unfolds, and makes the unintended outcomes even more heart-wrenching.

Looking at Guth's Mozart/Daponte trilogy as a whole, I think the point is that the spirit of Eros, manifested as the cherub/Cherubino in ""Figaro"" (and here as Don Alfonso), refuses to be satisfied with any existing relationship and pushes us to actions that inevitably have much more significant consequences than we anticipate. - Specifically, Cherubino grows up to be Don Giovanni, then dies but continues to exert influence as Don Alfonso. Guth's trilogy is a dark, but fascinating and sound, interpretation of all 3 of these operas that explores new facets of these well-known scores.",1312416000,9,1400,5.334841628959276
8406367,3,B003V4RK0A,"I purchased this Blu-ray version of Cosi after seeing Miah Persson and Isabel Leonard in Cosi live at the Met. Though the cast of this DVD does an admirable job overall, with the ever-able support the  Vienna Philharmonic, and Persson and Leonard are both very easy on the eyes, the ""updated"" production takes away substantially from the experience. It's one thing to suspend disbelief in opera, but we shouldn't be required to suspend intelligence. There are so many nonsensical moments in this production BECAUSE of the way it is presented, that it loses any comedic sense, and is simply absurd. Central to this problem is the fact that after the opening scene, Guglielmo and Ferrando are supposed to be disguised. During most of the opera, they are disguised only by a little dirt, and some of the time, not at all. Are Fiordiligi and Dorabella such complete idiots that they don't recognize their undisguised lovers? So the central plot element that makes for much of the comedy is non-existent in this production. Some of the other jokes don't translate into modern times at all, e.g., Despina's doctor act. Also, Skovhus' Don Alfonso comes across as purely cynical rather than a wiser and well-meaning puppet master.

Though the singing is first rate, and rates 4-5 stars, the production rates 1 star. Thus the 3 star rating. Overall, I prefer the Ponnelle/Gruberova/Ziegler/Stratas/Furlanetto film version for it's far better capturing of the bittersweet nature of this comedy, despite its video shortcomings compared with a Blu-ray. Also, Stratas is quite funny as Despina. Alternatively, if the Met were to release the performance I saw live on Blu-ray, I would buy it in a moment. Sadly, it was not an HD broadcast, so that seemingly won't happen.

Regardless of which version one buys, this is after all Cosi, and the music is spectacularly beautiful. So any Cosi, rather than none.",1295222400,12,1893,5.003174603174603
8406368,5,B003V4RK0A,"While I think that the reviewer Theater Gypsy is a little harsh on the Glyndebourne production which in my opinion is also good, I do agree that this one is superior, especially in its sense of comedy. Musically the two versions are comparable, but this one has better acting, better comedic flair, and while the four lovers are again comparable (one of them being of course the same singer Miah Persson in both versions), Despina and Don Alfonso are vastly superior in this one. I could subtitle it ""The Patricia Petibon Show,"" she was just spectacular, and I've never seen such a wicked, sadistic Don Alfonso. This is not to say that the other four principals were any less good, there isn't a single weak link in this production. Miah was fabulous as usual, and newcomer Isabel Leonard (whom I had seen and liked in the Met Romeo and Juliet) held her own - and oh boy, these two ladies surely look good! There is no doubt that this is the new Cosi standard, and one of the very best opera videos I've ever seen.",1287705600,15,1014,4.486486486486487
