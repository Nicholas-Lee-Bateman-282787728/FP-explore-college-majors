While I watch his videos and listen to his calming voice, I have not a care in the world. Totally stress relieving and mesmerizing,",1458259200,,250,4.704545454545454
8085993,2,B000BF6UIU,"I ordered this DVD because it said beginner instruction. Well, it never said any thing a beginner needs to know.  IE. What type spray paint, high gloss, gloss, satin,  flat , fast drying paint, how to keep the paint from drying too fast for the water effects. What colors should be in your basic palette. Do you paint on canvas, cardboard, poster paper. What to do if your paper sticks to the picture while trying to do texture. I had paper stick and rip into pieces trying one. No help on the DVD. You would think that a beginner DVD would answer these question but nope. On more then one of the videos the artist's head blocked what he was doing so you could not see. Save your money and go to youtube and watch the many videos there. A complete waste of my 20 bucks.",1409529600,,769,4.260273972602739
