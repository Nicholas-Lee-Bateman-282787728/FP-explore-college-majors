1935008,5,B0000E32VI,"To put it bluntly, I am a huge fan of Mudvayne.  And after seeing them live for the first time at the very Sanitarium Tour that is featured on this DVD (Wish it was my concert though: Orlando!), buying this was not just an option, it was a necessity.
Anywho, back to the actual DVD.  Once again, the live footage featured here is from last year's Summer Sanitarium tour.  And quite simply, the footage is awesome.  Aside from Chad's vocals being a little strained from touring the entire summer, the band sounds perfect.  I had seen them again a few months later when they came back to the House of Blues and his voice had gotten a lot better.
Anyway, the best performances had to have been Internal Primates Forever, -1, Nothing to Gein (oh yes), and World So Cold.  A surprise to many perhaps, but in all of the performances they play without their wild face paint and odd costumes.  I don't know if that matters to anybody, but the music was the same, so I didn't really care.  I guess it's good to see what they actually look like.  In addition to the live performances, after every song is a behind-the-scenes look into the life of the band on tour.  I found this section to be extremely interesting because I got to see what the band was like off the stage.  Turns out they're pretty normal, and very smart guys (Matt especially).
To my delight, they also included the World So Cold video and IT'S behind the scenes.  That too, I must say, rocks.
All in all, this DVD is a necessity to any Mudvayne fans: Awesome concert footage, awesome behind the scenes, awesome video, just pure awesome.  It truly helped me to relive the Sanitarium tour and further my love for their music.
Rock on Mudvayne!...and that's the truth!",1080000000,2,1725,4.490384615384615
1935009,5,B0000E32VI,"This DVD was very good. They had 10 live songs, all done very well, and they had alot of good bonus footage, on the tour bus, interviews, etc.  The best performance was ""-1"" but all 10 were very good and high energy. If you're a fan of Mudvayne, you need to have this. I don't have their first DVD so I cant comment.",1079049600,,316,4.015873015873016
1935010,5,B0000E32VI,"It's a shame they didn't have any performances from Texas Stadium, they rocked so hard there
anyway very very talented band, great dvd",1076976000,,134,4.869565217391305
1935011,5,B0000E32VI,"This is a must buy DVD! I sat in aw almost the whole video. I wasn't fortuneit enough to see them on the tour last summer, but this filled me in. A MUST BUY.",1075766400,2,157,3.6470588235294117
1935012,5,B0000E32VI,"This is one great DVD.  This is not near as strictly a live DVD as Mudvayne's Live Dosage release.  On All Access To All Things you get to get much more personal with the band and their everyday life on tour.
First off, let me review the live portion of the DVD.  You get ten live songs:
Internal Primates Forever
-1
Silenced
Death Blooms
Mercy, Severity
Cradle
Nothing To Gein
World So Cold
Not Falling
Dig
As you can see, it's a great selection of songs.  They were all recorded at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and are all performed during the day time.  The sound quality is much better than their previous live DVD, especially Chad's vocals.  Chad sounds fantastic compared to Live Dosage.  Another cool thing is the fact that they no longer wear make up onstage.  They look just look like regular guys.  These performances are proof that Mudvayne is a great performing band with massive amounts of talent and energy.
The performances are all very spaced out with the Behind The Scenes Footage put in between.  I really enjoyed the Behind The Scenes stuff that goes on.  You have footage of the band before and after the show, during interviews, on the tour bus, all kinds of crazy stuff.  It's great to see that this group of  rock stars are really pretty cool and calm guys.  I found Matt to be extremely intelligent, especially his little discussion on how technology has helped benefit music.  He really seems to know what he's talking about, and really seems to be an interesting guy.
You also get the World So Cold Video as well as a making of feature.  World So Cold is a wonderful song and the video is great.  I really think of this as a nice addition to the DVD.
To sum this all up, this is the best DVD release yet from Mudvayne.  If you are a fan of the band, you will love this release.",1075075200,35,1806,4.404833836858006
1935013,5,B0000E32VI,"I caught Mudvayne at the beginning of the Summer Sanitarium tour...they seemed somewhat uneasy on the huge stage.  Here, you have the end of the tour, and they not only seem at ease, but at the top of their game.  I wish I had been at the show in Salt Lake City where it was just them and Metallica.  This DVD made me long to see that particular show.  The backstage stuff is fun, and this is the live DVD the Mudvayne fan has been waiting for.",1073952000,3,444,4.068965517241379
1935014,5,B0000E32VI,"Well, I'm a huge Mudvayne fan...but only in the past year &1/2 (roughly) did I realize how amazing they really are. I own the first Mudvayne DVD, and I think it's pretty good. But now...they have gained so much power...trashed the makeup and outfits. Now it's just pure, heavy, great metal music. I just saw this DVD a few days ago with my friend. I think I just sat there with my jaw dropped most of the time. This DVD consists of them performing live on the Summer Sanitarium Tour. You even get to see James Hetfield a couple of times. Anyways. In between songs there are short interviews/clips of the band. And also a new video to check out. I think my favorite part in the whole thing is when they do the extended ending to ""Nothing to Gein"" where Chd just keeps repeating ""Zion...Zion...ZZIIIOOOOONNNNNNN."" It's so great. If you're already a Mudvayne fan, you'll love this...it's amazing (at least to me) to say the least. If you're not a fan of them really, but a fan of the genre, check it out...you never know. They have got past getting everyones attention, they have grown together, becoming a full-force attack. Ask me and I'll say that they are here to stay for a while. Oh yeah...my friend who got to see them live (which I had to miss due to class) now explains them as ""the new Pantera"", stepping up where Pantera left off. I agree. I could feel the power emanating from them while watching that DVD, even though it was just a DVD. So, to end this...one word. GREAT!!!",1070928000,6,1483,4.455882352941177
1935015,5,B0000E32VI,This DVD is awesome.  The live footage is great.  Lots of funny moments when the band is off stage.  Cool extras. Its worth the money.,1069718400,,134,4.28
1935016,5,B0000E32VI,"This Dvd is really good, it has many more featurs than Live Dosage.  Sure, once again, Chad's voice is not the best (I wish they had taken a day off before they filmed this, because I saw them live in Detroit, where they had taken a day off, and Chad hit every note his voice never broke).  But the over all sound and presence of the dvd is superb.  I love it, and I'm sure every Mudvayne fan will too. The DVD has many more features than on the last DVD.  It feautures interview with the band(who seem to be very childish at times, especially Ryan, but it works and has a lot of humor)their crew and fans.  The behind the scenes of ""World So Cold"" is disapointing, and not as in-depth as I would have hoped.  Also the music video for ""World So Cold"" is not mixed in 5.1 which was a disapointement, but that was the same thing for Live Dosage.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is into technical music (Bass players or Drummers especially) Because this band has two of the most well crafted players out there.  Enjoy, and ROCK ON!",1068681600,3,1032,4.229591836734694
1935053,1,B0000E32VI,"First off, Mudvayne should have prepared to make a DVD. Every time the camera is in there face they are either flipping it off, or telling the camera man to get out of there face, or not right now, or denying to be interviewed. I found they band as a hole, except for the guitar player, to be extremely cocky and rude. The do not have any reason to act the way that they do. They are not that good. Take a band like In Flames; one of the greatest bands ever, and there DVD is fantastic. They are so down to earth, professional, and have great ethics. They play perfect live as well. Mudvayne slotters every song that they do live. I felt embaressed to watch this DVD. I am a long time drummer and Matt's concept of timming live is horrible. Actually the band as a whole are all over the place. I would never pay a dime to watch these guys live. And to add to the disappointment is there attitudes as well. I will not support this band because they are simply not cool people, they don't respect the music they create in the studio, they are half rate studio musicians, they cant perform what they do in the studio live. That to me, as a fellow musician, is garbage. I will go and see a $5 dollar show before I were to spend money to see Mudvayne.
If you want a kick rockin DVD buy In Flames' Used and Abused ""In Live We Trust"". That is the best I have ever scene.
BOOOOOOOO MUDVAYNE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1214006400,,1399,4.204460966542751
1935054,5,B0000E32VI,"A great album! You can see all the power of the band on this DVD. If you like Mudvayne, you can't miss this one.",1142899200,2,112,3.7083333333333335
1935055,5,B0000E32VI,I loved the live shows as well as all the backstage footage of the band. All fans will lvoe this!,1142640000,,97,3.9
1935056,4,B0000E32VI,"I love Mudvayne, they're one of my favorite bands, but this DVD is merely above par. The concert portion is pretty good, despite some sound quality issues. I thought the vocals overpowered the band, and I also thought the vocals were lacking. The behind-the-scenes footage between the songs was okay, but it mainly consisted of ""Get that camera out of here."" The high-point of this footage was the interview with Matt, the drummer. It shows just how intellectual he is. The World So Cold video is very good. One of the best metal videos I've seen in recent years. But once again, the behind-the-scenes of this video wasn't very good. I am really glad that they don't open up entirely to the camera though. That's a sign of a true metal band in my opinion. The Mudcam is pretty good. No big complaints there.

Now as anyone can see, the songs they chose to play live are impecable. It highlights their career very well (minus Beginning Of All Things). As I said earlier though, the performance as a whole is less than stellar. Chad has the ability to reach the screams he does on CDs live, and he shows that ability here, but he sounds so out of breath the entire time. The band would sound as near to perfect as you can get, if you could just hear them. The bass is very prominent, the drums are less, but you can still make them out pretty easily. The guitar however, almost sounds like it's not even there. Greg is a good guitarist, not groundbreaking, but still good. I don't know if they thought it sounded good in rehearsal and something just went wrong or what, but that's something they should've corrected.

All in all they did a good job with this DVD. They leaned more for L.D. 50 songs than they did The Beginning..., but hey, L.D. 50 is a better CD. The songs they did play from The Beginning... were some of the best ones from that disc though. The songs they performed the best were -1, Death Blooms, Not Falling, and World So Cold. It's worth the money, I'll say that, but let's hope the next DVD they release has better quality sound.",1128038400,2,2050,4.449468085106383
1935057,5,B0000E32VI,"This DVD is unbelievable.  If you are thinking of recruiting any of your friends into ""Mudvaynians"", turn them on with this DVD.  The backstage stuff was cool, but the performances will blow you away.  Do not watch this before you go to bed - you'll be up all night!  The adrenaline rush is fantastic.  This band should have been a headliner, no doubt about it.  My personal favorite on this is ""Nothing to Gein.""  Absolute genius.  Chad's vocals are phenomenal - these guys were born to perform live.  And I agree with many other fans, losing the makeup was a VERY smart move.  I think it allows them and their music to be taken a lot more seriously.  If you are a fan of Mudvayne at all, or even just of metal, believe me - you MUST buy this DVD!  It will not leave you unsatisfied...",1112227200,10,786,4.308219178082192
1935058,5,B0000E32VI,"After a failed re imagining of their look and sound Mudvayne ditch the make up and play it straight and hard and loud and fast.
They had to because their follow up to LD 50 wasn't well received at all.
I had to let this new material really grow on me because on my first listen I was really put off and my expecations were deflated greatly.
I realise now that LD 50 cannot and should not be topped.
So enter Muds second live dvd from the Summer Suckatorium tour where they played as an opening act for bands who are not their equal or even bands worthy of sharing a stage with a band like Mudvayne.
This angers me a little but hey any material Mudvayne is willing to share or release is something I am prone to check out.
I own every Mud cd and dvd and as long as they stay true to themselves I will continue to support them.
Losing the make up in my opinion was the best move they made so far.",1099958400,,894,4.02808988764045
1935059,5,B0000E32VI,"this DVD is so nasty!!!! Mudvayne is so damn good and they show you in this DVD...This is the most talented band around these days and every performance in this DVD is flawless, every song is so crisp and sharp its like your right there .....I freaked out and punched my TV...... and a bunch of other things in the room....if you were here I'd punch you too ...I recommend you watch this with someone so you can have someone to punch",1093737600,3,433,4.2926829268292686
1935060,3,B0000E32VI,The dvd wasn't that good..I mean the songs I injoyed personaly. But when they played a couple of their old songs they just completely ruind them. They lost their make up and everything else all due to the lack of popularity with make up theses days. But the new songs they played they did a pretty good job. The back stage footage sucked ass completly. But personaly even tho I haven't seen the first or second one I recoment you buy one of those cause I see the reviews are pretty good. But If you are  into masks I would recomend the slipknot's Disasterpeices dvd cause I here its reallly good.,1090713600,,596,4.36936936936937
1935061,1,B0000E32VI,"Im a huge fan of mudvayne and i love there first dvd, but this one is crap. Theres a bunch of useless footage of them pretty much doin jack sh** back stage, all the concert footage is in the daytime with no makeup un like the pictures on the back of the case, and to boot half the songs are on the other dvd. As if youd rather see them playing them again with no makeup and in the daytime instead of the new songs. oh and the not falling video is not on it either so unless youll pretty much settle for anything id bye the first dvd cut off the volume and pop in the end of all things to come.",1085616000,4,593,3.8292682926829267

8001827,5,B0000E32VI,"For what it is this dvd is pretty damn good. It is a mix of live songs and a bit of band dialogue(interviews,just chatting,joking around,drinking and having fun introducing their crew) in between the songs. The best part is you can isolate what you want,if you just want to watch the live songs then you press play on the live set symbol. The main menu may seem confusing but all it is is the segments inbetween the live footage & it is no different than just pressing play all. You can just as easily hit the skip scene if you want & it'll go to the next chapter. All in all it is pretty sweet,you get 10 live songs & they are executed well. Better quality visually than Live Dosage in Peoria & better sound(although i did not have a problem with the audio of the Peoria dvd) they are not dcked out in makeup there just playing really intense and loud. Highlights of the show are Ryans bass shots & audio of his bass,the guy is a friggin' animal and he likes to jump around and slap and pull his strings to no end. In my opinion he is an underrated bass player. Matt really impressed me as well with his drum kit(the green&black kit) he just goes nuts but pulls it off and makes it look like he is not even trying. Chads vocals have gotten stronger as he has found a way to strengthen his voice through exercise,because anybody can scream for an hour and then not have a voice for 2 days(it used to happen to me til' i found a way not to strip my voice) and he executes his vocal duties with such accuracy. Gregs guitar work is always spot on but on this dvd he does look like he is in the groove where Peoria it looked as if they all just went through the motions(except Ryan). Plus you get to hear songs from The End of All Things to Come such as Mercy/Severity,World so Cold,Not Falling & Silenced. Plus you get oldschool LD:50 songs like -1, Dig,Death Blooms,Cradle,Nothing to Gein & Internal Primates Forever. Peoria is the whole LD:50 album. This is a really good addition to a Mudvayne fans collection. Personally i enjoyed this & Peoria dvd's as well as own their first 3 albums & Lost and Found. After that it seems like Chad lost his way being in Hellyeah. This is a great dvd for the price & if any fan wants better quality than Peoria or withoit the gimmicky makeup then go get this. Only downer is Not Falling video isn't on here it was released as an EP dvd just like Dig was when the Peoria dvd came out. So if u cannot live without the video get the EP dvds or buy the film Ghost Ship(great movie) Hope this was helpful,enjoy.",1425081600,,2543,4.245360824742268
8001828,5,B0000E32VI,Very real look at the band behind the stage.  Some great concert outtakes also. The fact that the concerts were shot in the daytime shows a raw side of Mudvayne. They didn't need a bunch of lights and show to be a kick-ass band.,1378080000,,228,4.181818181818182
8001829,4,B0000E32VI,Greta purchase. Awesome DVD. Enjoyed the behind the scenes footage and live concert footage. One of my favorite bands and product was just as described and a painless procedure to obtain.,1363651200,,187,5.064516129032258

8001832,5,B0000E32VI,The sun setting on the band in Salt Lake City is worth the price of the DVD alone!  Absolutely stunning performances by Chad!  We need more Mudvayne videos! After all......they may never play again!  *sniff*,1316044800,,207,4.857142857142857
8001833,5,B0000E32VI,"Everything else is basically already reviewed on this one, but I own something like 20-30 dvds of metal bands, so I'm only reviewing the content of the 'backstage' and 'concert' and I know what I like, so anyway here we go.

This DVD is a good balance between 'backstage' and 'concert.' With an option to view just the concert, which is a nice bonus. The concert won't disappoint, and more importantly, the backstage won't make you hate the band.

So if you want to learn more about Mudvayne, it has good 'backstage' and if you want to listen to Mudvayne in the background, this won't disappoint either.

It's my first review on Amazon, give me a break. :P",1230854400,2,656,4.5423728813559325
