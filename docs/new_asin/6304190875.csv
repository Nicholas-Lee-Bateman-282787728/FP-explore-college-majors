804297,5,6304190875,"Our son loves Thomas videos and I am happy to let him watch as they present a positive example for behavior.  Once again, George Carlin does a  great job of narrating.  In addition, one of the nice things about this  particular tape, is that it features characters other than James and  Gordon.",967075200,5,294,4.576923076923077
804460,1,6304190875,"I'm not steeped in Thomas the Tank Engine lore; my son showed some interest in the program and it looked like a pretty good series, so we decided to get him this DVD set. However, as much as I appreciate the fine model train artistry (it is awesome!) and George Carlin's narration, I just can't get into this series.

First and foremost, I think it is AWFUL that you have to watch 5 minutes of commercials before you can watch any of the Thomas DVD. The DVD prohibits skipping the loud, tedious commercials. Because of this, this DVD never gets watched (1 of 3). If you don't mind having to watch 5 minutes of commercials (or start the DVD and come back 5 minutes later to watch it), this won't bother you as much as it does us.

Also, as has been mentioned, the stories are in a completely jumbled order, so its difficult to piece together a linear narrative of how the characters develop. If you don't know much about Thomas and his friends (like me) I would not recommend this series. On its face, the series looks very appealing, but in the end, simple goofs in putting together the DVD make it aggravating to watch and difficult to fully appreciate.",1144627200,4,1154,4.438679245283019
804461,3,6304190875,"I know you're always going to find a person who will argue whether or not something is the best but I'm trying to find someone who agrees with the episode list. After the Ringo era was re narrated by George Carlin they decided not to even include the old episodes in the new DVDs. I think if you're going to buy a Thomas DVD these days you should go out and buy the early days set. I individually wrote reviews for each of these DVDs but I'm disappointed by the 5 minutes of useless commercials that come before the DVD. Not only that but sometimes you have to wait 2 minutes to actually play the DVD itself.

Of the three greatest hits sets, the Percy set was easily the best. The Thomas one was alright but the last few on it weren't' very good. I have mixed feelings about the Best of James but I am glad the Best of Gordon was not put on because that set was a disgrace. This set may be good for you if your child is just getting into Thomas but try and find the earlier ones if you can. It's not very easy to find the best Thomas sets but if you can, they are worth it.",1133136000,15,1074,4.018691588785047
804462,3,6304190875,I got this for my friend's boy- so I think I got the review toned down. She said it had the SAME preview that lasted forever before the actual video came on. The 2 1/2 year old saw it so many times that he just would get up to do other things...and she couldn't fast forward through it. She sold it later on Ebay. HA HA HA.,1130371200,4,323,3.8358208955223883
804463,5,6304190875,"To start of, we're not a thomas fan.  But having received a thomas train set from a friend, we gave the dvds a try as well.  To my surprise, these are great videos to show to my son.  They expose the daily activities in life.  Good or bad, a lesson is learned at the end.  It helps foster good friendship, teamwork & cooperation, and responsibility.  Something that cannot be taught in school alone. Thomas videos aren't just any kind of videos.  There's always a moral to learn in each & every story stops.  I believe these are the types of videos to show kids to expose them to the real world.  The trains may be crossed but it's one way to help kids deal with life's pressures.  You can't just show them all the goodies in the world and later get shocked of what the world really is.  They just need your supervision when you think there are things needed to be explained so as not to mislead them.  But in my own opinion, they are just great.  He's free to watch this anytime.

Best of Thomas, Percy and James are just wonderful... We hope they come up with another edition of the collector's edition in a boxset.  It's a great compilation of only the best story stops in one great price.  Nothing beats that.  We're discovering more of thomas.  A new item in our wishlist.",1118793600,2,1277,4.338983050847458
804464,4,6304190875,I bought this for my 2 year old son who loves Thomas & Friends.  The set is great value for money - and we particularly enjoyed the sing-a-longs on each disc.  I think the DVDs all have wonderful story lines and the lessons to learn as well.  Overall I am very happy with the purchase and my son is delighted with his DVDs.  I am sure they will bring him many hours of enjoyment :),1115251200,3,381,4.04
804465,3,6304190875,"The stories in these DVDs are our favorite classics which is why it gets 3 stars. The problem? Whoever put these together put no thought into them whatsoever! These would have been GREAT if they had put the stories in chronological order. It would have been so easy! Maybe the kids don't notice, but the parents who have to listen/watch repeatedly sure do. For example, the James video has several episodes mentioning James' problem with bootlaces before showing the episode with the bootlaces. Another problem with the James video - they had an excerpt of the James song in between episodes but did not play it at the end. Why wouldn't they play the James song on the James video?

Overall, very disappointing that they did not put a little more effort into these DVDs (this includes the Gordon video which we also have). What a wasted opportunity!

Can you tell I've watched too many Thomas videos???!!!",1103068800,29,905,4.75796178343949
804466,5,6304190875,"The Gallant Old Engine is a great Thomas video and all the stories are fantastic, but my personal favorite is Fish. It's like The Flying Kipper only with Duck helping Henry. I am a big fan of Henry and this was a great story for the Henry fans. Anyway, I'll tell you about the rest of the stories: In HENRY AND THE ELEPHANT find out what surprise awaits Henry when he takes some workman to clear out a tunnel of a rather mysterious object. In YOU CAN'T WIN see how Stuart and Falcon get to help old Duke when he can't pull his passenger train by himself. In SPECIAL ATTRACTION, Toby is on his way to the carnival as the special attraction. But when he gets there, someone tells him that the carnival doesn't need a special attraction after all. In PASSENGERS AND POLISH, Duncan is mad that he didn't get polished and decides to come to a standstill on the viaduct while pulling passengers. In GALLANT OLD ENGINE, find out how Rheneas saves the railway and welcome him home when he finally comes back from the works. And in FISH, see what happens to Duck when he helps Henry with the Flying Kipper and ends up in a very fishy situation. The music video on this tape is ""REALLY USEFUL ENGINE"", a cute song about everyone's favorite #1 blue engine, Thomas. I'd recommend this Thomas video, you'll enjoy it. :)",1102118400,3,1306,4.423236514522822
804467,5,6304190875,"I have to disagree with those who feel that the engines being ""cross"" with each other is not something they want their children to watch. I too was not sure about the content until my son misbehaved and later apologized for being ""cheeky"" (a common term used in the DVDs). Although the engines are cross with each other, they always learn a lesson: it's not nice to tease, everyone makes mistakes, the engines are ""grounded"" when they misbehave, etc. My son loves to watch Thomas, and often acts out the stories with his own train set.",1100476800,9,535,4.583333333333333
804539,2,6304190875,"Our daughter loves her Thomas the Tank Engine, Percy, Lady and Salty trains.  They look so sweet with their happy little smiles.  Luckily, the trainset we bought for her came with a free video because I would have hated to have spent the money on buying the DVD for her.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned - these trains are always ""cross"" and just all around grumpy.  Everyone in Thomas World is miserable.  So, we still let her play with her trainset - she just can't watch the videos.",1092700800,9,493,4.433333333333334

In addition to loyal fans' favorite episodes, the discs have extras such as learning games, coloring pages, and more.",1087171200,2,291,5.170212765957447
804541,5,6304190875,"We all know that Rhenas had gone to the works to be mended and we had seen some little performances by him but we really didn't know him. In this tape he finally comes home. And if any true Thomas fans remember when Henry got stuck in the tunnel (First Tape) then Henry and the Elephant is the right episode for you. Also by Henry another Flying Kipper episode. Both these sequel episodes are good but they don't match the real ones. Alsp a flashback from the time of Stuart and Falcon unearths a little more from the past of Duke. Overall the episodes on this tape  are really good and this is a good buy.
The episodes on this video are Henry and the Elephant,You Can't Win, Special Attraction,Passengers and Polish, The Gallant Old Engine, Fish, and the crummy music video Really Useful Engine",1066348800,2,795,4.482758620689655

7864225,4,6304190875,"I have to agree with others about the order of the stories. I do wish they would put something out that tells the story in order as it happens, and I do prefer the older stories too. However my kids love Thomas and all his friends and don't seem to notice the order in which they are shown. I had to laugh one day when my three year old son came up to me and informed me that he ""needed some hot tea in his boiler"". He was asking for some herbal tea which we are in the habit of drinking and which he happens to like very much. I found a talkin Thomas engin and that is his all time favorite toy. He takes it to bed with him every night. There is nothing objectionable in these stories. Good lessons on friendship and treating others with respect eaven if they look different from us, and apologizing sincerely when one is in the wrong.",1299196800,,836,4.103658536585366

7864227,3,6304190875,"As stated before, the dvds open with several minutes of commercials. My experience was that we could fast forward through some of them, except on the Thomas dvd, which forces you to watch them all. There are also several logos that you are forced to watch.

Let me tell you something - when your two-year-old son has just had surgery and has to stay at home to recover, and wants to see Thomas, the last thing he wants is a bunch of logos, fbi warnings, and commercials.

The narrators are inconsistent. I prefer the british narrators, especially Ringo, but this set is a real mess, mixing the actors and wandering in and out of sequence.

There also seems to be an emphasis on big messy accidents in this set, which gets a bit scary for the little ones.

Okay, but not great.",1165190400,,776,4.443661971830986
