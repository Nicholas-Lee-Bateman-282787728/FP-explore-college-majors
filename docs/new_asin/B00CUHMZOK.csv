5741983,5,B00CUHMZOK,"Another great concert with beautiful music and a great enthusiastic audience.  ""Time to Say Goodbye"" is one of my favorite songs.  The only improvement would be to have English subtitles as the language is Dutch.",1411084800,,212,5.0285714285714285
5741984,1,B00CUHMZOK,"The words of the songs are predominately in Dutch and when one cannot speak Dutch, most of the pleasure is taken out of the DVD.
We were very disappointed.
Understandably, it cannot be returned, BUT it would be a great help if the seller could give one a list of the songs played by showing the 'flip side.
I have bought it, but I cannot speak Dutch, haven't downloaded it, I don't have any Dutch or Dutch -speaking friends, SO it will simply gather dust on my shelf.
I was most disappointed. I expected to give this a 5 star rating.

5741988,5,B00CUHMZOK,"The best music ever. Everyone will love Andres' music. We love every album that Andre comes out with, and i believe we have every one.",1403308800,,134,4.4

5741990,3,B00CUHMZOK,"We have every Andre Rieu DVD and enjoy him and the JSO, but this DVD, and it is still ok, left a lot to be desired. As mentioned elsewhere, about halfway there is a defect that freezes the DVD. But, even worse is the amount of material left out from the concert. No full pieces from the Platin Tenors or Kimmy Skota or Carmen Monarcha. All appeared very briefly in the DVD, but none did a full number. Mirusia got her full exposure, but that's to be expected. Extra features could have been more than the interview, but the interview was done well. This DVD will be at the bottom of the stack of Andre Rieu DVD's we play over and over.",1399766400,4,635,4.213114754098361
5741991,5,B00CUHMZOK,"This is what sets Andre' Rieu apart from all other entertainers. How many of us would ever know what transpires in other countries of the world if it was not revealed to us by people like this. Just as with Prince Charles and Princess Diana, royalty is a facination to many. Andre' found a very regal way to introduce the royalty of the Netherlands to the world, and combine a fun/audience involved concert that folks will remember for a life time. Highly recommended.",1397779200,,468,4.650602409638554
5741992,1,B00CUHMZOK,Very bad skipping .Sent back for credit. No problem. At first it played o.k. for a while but around half way thru it started locking up and gradually got worse.,1395878400,,160,4.366666666666666
5741993,5,B00CUHMZOK,"If you like Andre Rieu at all, you will love this performance. It's classic Rieu in a HUGE venue brilliantly designed and executed by Andre's son, where Dutch utter love for their country and culture are magnificently and unabashedly portrayed. American patriotism used to be like this before we allowed liberals to shove their kool-aid down our throats.",1395446400,2,354,5.120689655172414
5741994,5,B00CUHMZOK,"beautiful music and fantastic orchestra performances as always
it is a treat to find another fantastic dvd by this artist",1393113600,,121,5.1
5741995,5,B00CUHMZOK,"Love Rieu's performances; they always entertain even with the repetitions.  But then, I favor more classical music anyway.  Good job.",1391904000,,133,5.6
5741996,2,B00CUHMZOK,"It was all in Dutch language. The music is fine but no translation. Usually, in every DVD Andre either speaks in English or there is a translation .",1391644800,6,148,4.321428571428571
5741997,5,B00CUHMZOK,"Despite a flaw or three with the mastering (or perhaps the mixing) overall well worth the price. You will need to be fluent in...Danish ?? Norwegian ???...I KNOW I'm embarrassing myself, so I'll stop while I'm behind!",1390176000,,217,4.891891891891892
5741998,5,B00CUHMZOK,"No matter what, Andre Rieu always meets the expectations.
Only concern is that the website should mention if a DVD really is suitable for US standards.",1385942400,,151,4.846153846153846
5741999,5,B00CUHMZOK,ANDRE RIEU IS THE BEST AT WHAT HE DOES.  THE MUSIC IS REPEDITAVE IN EACH DVD BUT HE SOME HOW MAKES IT NEW EVERY TIME.  HOWEVER THIS ONE IS ALMOST TOO MUCH.  THE DUTCH LOVE THEIR ROYALS ESPECIALLY THE NEW YOUNG ONES.  ALL THE WHILE VENERATING THEIR FORMER QUEEN.  DUTCH DO NOT NEED MUCH OF A REASON TO PARTY.,1385164800,,307,4.135593220338983
5742000,5,B00CUHMZOK,"Nice disk unfortunately track error on 1 selection making it unplayable after that selection (Bad copy).  Found this out
after 1 month (item was a gift).  As such Amazon will not refund/replace.  Buyer beware.  This is not first time I have
have bad copy DVD but first from Andre Rieu.",1383609600,11,285,4.64

5742002,5,B00CUHMZOK,"My mother loves Andre Rieu and I have bought many of his DVD's for us to watch together.  My favorite had been the one from Radio City Music Hall, but this is amazing.  The performers' attire, which is always beautiful, elegant and appropriate, has been upgraded.  The scanning of the crowd shows the magnitude of his hometown's love for this man and appreciation for what he has done.  All of the best songs are on this one.  It is a must if you are considering buying this.",1381881600,,475,4.413793103448276
5742003,5,B00CUHMZOK,we love all of his music and have all his CD and DVDs. Not enough of him around.; need more.,1380412800,,92,3.65
5742004,5,B00CUHMZOK,"I love the show... Rieu's performances are enjoyable. However, I must tell you,  there is one distraction in the DVD where it seems something was skipped (bleeped?) and the result is a momentary break in the presentation.",1379289600,8,221,4.972972972972973
5742005,5,B00CUHMZOK,"Andre & his Orchestra are absolutely the best available music
that I have found.  They play meaningful AND beautiful music.

themselves and the result is fabulous.  Keep them coming.
