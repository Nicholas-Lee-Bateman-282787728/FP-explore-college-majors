7793189,5,0865973407,"I don't know why the Amazon listing states ""Staring Steven Sheppard"" That name is completely unfamiliar to me and I am completley familiar with with this lecture series. Please read further to find details of the titles and scholars contained herein and my little review that does not do justice to this body of work.

Following is a list of lectures and the Authors:

Vol. 1  Austrian And Neoclassic Economics by Sherwin Rosen (Program 61 min.)

Vol. 2  Hayekian Socialism by Richard Epstein (Program 84 min.)

Vol. 3  Hayek, Practitioner of Social Justice by Michael Novak (Program 79 min.)

Vol. 4  Hayek, Radical Reactionary by Lord Ralph Harris (Program 80 min.)

Vol. 5  Hayek's Legacy by Kurt Leube (Program 82 min.)

Vol. 6  Hayek and the Fate of Liberty in the Twentieth Century by Kenneth Minogue (Program 86 min.)

Vol. 7  Morality adn Community in the Extended Market Order by James Buchanan (Program 80 min.)

The series passes on a meaningful impression and lasting knowledge of Hayekian Scholarship, history and contemporary application by the best classical libertarian scholars the world has to offer. A serious student of Political Economy must have this knowledge and those well schooled will enjoy the depth and breath. That it is offered in both audio and video format allows for a course easy to be followed and easily revisited. In preparation for oral presentations, desertaions and exams this series is the best source to emulate and stay true to the classical style. There are all gains from this trade.",1230681600,,1529,4.960629921259843
