2877930,3,B000S0GYJI,I just finished watching all 3 discs in this set and I have to say that I was slightly disappointed.  I had to adjust my TV to watch disc 1 (it was a bit too bright).  I was also bothered that they changed the music during the zombie scene in The Phantom Menace and Mr. Kraft's montage in Super Hero.  Even so it is still Sabrina and if I can overlook the Josh character I can overlook these minor problems.,1213833600,2,407,4.0625
2877931,4,B000S0GYJI,"I remember the first episode of sabrina the teenage witch that i ever watched on television, and i was only 8 or 9. Since that moment i was hooked! I am now almost 19 and still watch the re-runs on television. I was so excited when i found out that they were starting to release the seasons on dvd! I have since become a collector of Sabrina, and some of my other favorite tv shows. I must agree that the fourth season isn't as great as other seasons but is still a joy to watch. I can't wait for all of the seasons to be out on dvd!",1212192000,,533,3.9444444444444446
2877932,5,B000S0GYJI,"I am THIRTY years old, so I sorta ""grew up"" with Sabrina and I can tell you, I have probably seen each episode about a 100 times and they never get old!  EVER!  Melissa Joan Hart is just about the cutest and funniest chick around and I love every other character on the show as well!  I own the first three seasons too and I just pre-ordered season four and I can't wait to get it!  I swear, i'll be watchin' this show even when i'm 90!  (Even if it does drive my husband crazy ha ha,..but really, he watches it with me sometimes, and I think he kinda likes it too but he'd just NEVER admit it!  Ha ha!)

Btw, I totally agree with the person who said, the fourth season is when it started to be: ""not as great"" cuz there was no Libby, no Valerie (OR Jenny,) and I was NEVER a big fan of Josh either, he was just ANNOYING, but Salem is still awesome, and so are the rest of em' (especially Harvey,) and Sabrina of course,...goes without saying!

So I strongly recommend anyone who is a Sabrina fan to buy this!  Even if you're not a Sabrina fan,...buy it and you WILL be!  This show is TIMELESS and it will always be a classic!

PS:  And let's all congratulate Melissa Joan Hart on the birth of her second son Braydon, and wish her a HAPPY BIRTHDAY (it was last Friday, April 18th!) She's just as adorable as ever!...Toldja I was a hardcore
Sabrina fan! Be sure to buy season 4! (And Amazon has the best price!)

2877933,5,B000S0GYJI,I watched the first four or five seasons of this on tv when they first came out and I loved the show. I have since bought the first 3 seasons on dvd and am preordering this one. I am now 18 and can connect more with the show but no matter what age you are this show is great.,1208563200,5,275,3.6779661016949152
2877934,4,B000S0GYJI,"I have a seventeen year old who LOVES Sabrina, she got the first two seasons during the holiday and watched them both within a week.  I had pre-ordered the 3rd season and when we got it, she opened it and watched it right away. I have already pre-ordered the 4th season.

I don't know about everyone out there, but I would rather have her watching Sabrina than Gossip Girl, or the other teen show on NIK that I cant think of right now.  She has her whole life to meet someone and fall in love, why expose herself to the pressures that those teens face.

If I had a tween who is interested in television, I would reccomend Sabrina to any parent.  She is pretty wholesome and each show deals with issues we have all faced at one time or another.  Its good wholesome entertainment for your daughter",1206921600,21,795,4.337837837837838
2877935,4,B000S0GYJI,"So season Four is probably my least favorite season but it's still Sabrina so it's amazing compared to half the stuff they call entertainment.

Reasons Why This Season Let Me Down:
-Dreama
-Brad the witch Hunter
-No Libby
-No Valerie
-Josh

Reasons Why This Season Didn't Suck:
-Sabrina's antics
-The aunts branching off in new directions
-Harvey
-And of course the reason the show is completely worth every dime:

2878014,5,B000S0GYJI,"Season 1-3 are great while season 4 is good but not great since we unfortunately loose Libby and Valerie. Overall not a bad season since the principal cast did a great job. Jenna Leigh Green was hilarious as the mean popular girl, Libby Chessler one of the reasons why season 1-3 stands out during the high school scenes. Also this season Sabrina needed her friend, Valerie, it felt random seeing Sabrina not having at least one friend but instead we got pointless Dreama. Like I said not a bad season and we still get to see the hilarious Hilda and Salem but unfortunately this is the last season of the high school years. Season 5 aka the college years is where the series goes down to a different direction and with new characters.",1467244800,,734,4.526315789473684

2878157,5,B000S0GYJI,Season 4 was definitely the last season that felt like it had somewhat of a life to it compared to the later seasons. It's Sabrina's senior year of high school. She thinks she has it made with Valerie moving in with her but things don't always work out in Sabrina's favor. That is just the tip of the iceberg. I do not enjoy the love triangle between Harvey and Josh. I guess you could say I didn't enjoy Josh's character so much. He seemed to try too hard to be the cool college guy in love with Sabrina. You just wanted to root for Harvey because his love was genuine.,1436918400,,570,4.1909090909090905

2878177,4,B000S0GYJI,"I've got to admit from the outset that the fourth season of Sabrina the Teenage Witch has never been my favorite.  So I wasn't exactly looking forward to rewatching it this summer.  Yes, it still has its faults.  But I also discovered that it wasn't quite as bad as I remembered it.

The first strike against the season comes in the season opener.  In the first season, Sabrina turned 16.  As season 4 opens, she is turning 18.  Now I've heard some people explain that seasons 2 and 3 are really one long year despite the fact that they included two Halloween episodes and two Christmas episodes.  This tainted timeline with no warning was something I never quite recovered from.  (However, I had no problem with Sabrina doing four years of college in two seasons.  Go figure.)

Anyway, that means the basics of the show are pretty much the same.  Sabrina Spellman (Melissa Joan hart) is a half witch half mortal trying to survive high school with the added complication of magic.  Aiding her in her journey are aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick).  This season, Hilda gives up her violin and buys a clock shop that includes a magic clock that brings people through time.  Then there's the family's talking cat Salem (voiced by Nick Bakay), a warlock sentenced to do time as a cat for plotting to take over the world.  She's got a great boyfriend in Harvey (Nate Richert).  Unfortunately, the assistant principal has become the principal, and Mr. Kraft (Martin Mull) is still out to get Sabrina and her friends despite dating Zelda.

This season included some cast shake ups.  Gone are old nemesis Libby and best friend Valerie.  Filling the nemesis role, we get Brad (Jon Huertas, currently on ABC's Castle).  He's an old friend of Harvey's who has moved back to town.  He takes an instant dislike to Sabrina, and it turns out that he has a gene that makes him a witch hunter.  He is clued in to any use of magic, and if he catches any of it and figures out what is going on, his accusation could turn the witch into a mouse for 100 years.  Meanwhile, Sabrina gets a new friend in Dreama (China Shavers), a witch who is having a hard time using her magic.  Sabrina must tutor Dreama or Sabrina will have her newly issued witch's license taken away from her.

Now you would think that these two new characters could set up some very interesting storylines.  Brad does cause complications on a few occasions, although he also seems to ignore magic on others.  It all depends on what the writers need for that episode, I have a feeling.  But poor, poor Dreama.  She might struggle with magic two or three times, but usually the focus is solely on Sabrina's problems.  And any tutoring?  Forget about it.

Honestly, I get the feeling that the writers just didn't know what to do with any kind of story arc for the season.  That's a shame since the quizzes in season two and the family secret in season three were handled so well.

My other issue with this season is Josh (David Lascher).  He's a college guy and Sabrina's boss at her new job at a coffee shop.  They have a mutual crush.  That fact that Harvey is still Sabrina's boyfriend the entire season while she harbors and plays around with acting on feelings for Josh just bugs me.  If she and Harvey weren't dating, I would take her flirting and trying to impress Josh as fine (although I always wanted her to wind up with Harvey).  But the fact that she is doing this while still dating Harvey just drives me up a wall.

If the overall storylines bother me, the episodes themselves are still as funny and creative as ever.  Another family secret comes to light when Sabrina learns one of her aunts was adopted.  Halloween follow Sabrina who is trying to avoid the holiday only to get trapped in a coffee house full of zombies.  Sabrina learns not to mess with Mother Nature (a real person of course) when she tries to change the weather.  Too much weight loss makes Sabrina disappear.  We learn about Other Realm wedding traditions when Sabrina becomes maid of honor and substitute father of the bride at the wedding of Salem's daughter.  And an ambition spell turns Mr. Kraft into Charles Lindbergh and Harvey into a superhero.

As I said, the individual episodes are very fun, and I can't help but laugh at the out of control situations Sabrina manages to get herself into.  The acting can be over the top at times, but that usually fits the wild situations that are happening.  It rarely distracts me from the comedy.  The special effects are also quite good, and since the show involves magic, there are quite a few of them.

While the normal parade of pop starts from the late 90's stop by (Britney Spears appears in the first episode for example), they also get people like Shirley Jones to guest star as Sabrina's grandmother.  In one of my favorite bits of casting for the season, Dick van Dyke shows up as a former associate of Salem who is trying to turn his life around.

This season contained 22 episodes, and all of them are here on three DVD's.  The shows are in their native full frame and stereo sound.  And that's it.  As with all the other sets of the show, there are no extras.

This season still definitely has faults, although they aren't quite as bad as I remembered them being.  While season four of Sabrina the Teenage Witch isn't as good as the last two seasons, it is still very fun for fans.",1432252800,,5393,4.528497409326425

2878296,5,B000S0GYJI,"Disclaimer: I do not believe in witchcraft. Everything that someone who claims to be a witch can do can be explained by science or exposed to be a hoax. I love books and movies like Sabrina, Harry Potter, Wizard of Oz, etc. because they typically reflect actual conditions in our society, such as the fight between good and evil.

In the case of Sabrina, we see a commentary about what it's like to be the weird one at school, like the nerd in a regular classroom.

Sabrina is more than the adventures of a teenage witch in high school (four seasons) and college (three seasons), living with her two aunts because her witch father is stuck in a book of magic, and unable to live with her mother for the first two years of her training due to her mom's mortality interfering somehow with her blossoming, just discovered, powers.

The show is a commentary on how the gifted student often has trouble fitting in at school, the troubles he has getting along with his peers, getting teased by the jocks and cheerleaders, and not having outlets for average recreation with others.

Yes, many of the comedic situations have mainly to do with how people see the results of the witchcraft then try to explain it away. The principal especially provides some comic relief, especially when he dates one, then the other aunt for awhile.

With this review, I am reviewing all seven seasons of Sabrina. The first two seasons were better than the third and fourth, in my humble opinion, then when she got into college and moved into a house with several other students, the plots brightened back up again because there were new situations to be explored.

Seasons 1-2: Five Stars
Seasons 3-4: Four Stars
Season 5: Five Stars
Seasons 6-7: Four Stars

If you enjoy comedy, and you enjoy witchcraft that sometimes goes wrong, and you enjoy seeing different views of life, then get these sets. I wouldn't have paid for them, but I was delighted to get them ""free"" as a perk of my membership in Amazon Prime.

(I do have one question that bothers me slightly. As I vaguely recall, Sabrina was 16 and starting tenth grade in Season One. Here it is Season Four and she is a Senior. Is my memory faulty, or did they do some creative switching around) (Since the Harry Potter movies had a similar mistake, I can't blame Sabrina's producers. (Look for what years Wood, Harry's Quidditch Coach, was in school. It looks like he went to school for eight years.)",1405382400,2,2432,4.613425925925926

Dreama I kind of liked as a character and I think actually that having another witch around Westbridge could make for some excellent situational comedy. however, they didn't do as much with it as they could.

But all in all i liked this season best as it is the first season where Sabrina did not seem like a total whiny child, she seemed more adult. and for me overall season 4 was the best of 1-4.",1264204800,,567,4.280373831775701
2878386,3,B000S0GYJI,"The fourth season--the last of the highschool years--of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH disappointed fans in many ways, mostly concerning the departures of much-loved cast members Lindsay Sloane (who'd played goofy best friend Valerie for two years) and Jenna Leigh Green (Sabrina's arch-enemy Libby).  In their place was China Shavers as Dreama, an apprentice witch and new Westbridge High classmate whom Sabrina must take under her wing.  Another strange plot-twist which proved unpopular with fans was the arrival of Brad (Jon Huertas), Harvey's new best friend, who's revealed to be a witch-hunter intent on unmasking Sabrina.

Despite it's flaws, the fourth season still serves up lots of memorable storylines largely thanks to the ever-adorable Melissa Joan Hart--Sabrina well and truly grows up this year, and her relationship with Harvey (Nate Richert) goes through some particularly rocky stages, mostly thanks to a new guy on the scene, Josh (David Lascher), whom Sabrina harbours a strong crush on.  Also back are Sab's hilarious aunts Hilda and Zelda (Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick), sarcastic Principal Kraft (Martin Mull) and faithful, wisecracking feline Salem (voiced by Nick Bakay).

COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:

""Love Means Having to Say You're Sorry"" - Reeling from the aftermath of their shocking break-up, Sabrina tries to use Hilda's Lost in Time clock to apologise to Harvey.
