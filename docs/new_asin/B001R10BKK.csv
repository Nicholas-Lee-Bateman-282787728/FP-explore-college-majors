8336970,5,B001R10BKK,"It not only has a good story line ,but is very good movie,a heart wrenching love story ,a man's ego ,a sons anger ,a woman's suffering,a real teacher's. I invited a friend over to watch it ,and I translated the whole movie to her she loved it ,that is why I am ordering a couple more,so she can take one to her mother's house and watch it again with her. Yes I loved it of course it helps that I worked background in the movie my friend spotted me right away,that was almost forty years ago. The part was filmed on an old ranch in San Jose mountains in Ca. I am from Watsonville Ca. I also worked background in an American movie with Micheal Norris Chuck Norrises son,the name of that movie is Survival Games it was filed all over Watsonville Ca. It was made around thirty three years ago",1428192000,,788,4.225165562913907
