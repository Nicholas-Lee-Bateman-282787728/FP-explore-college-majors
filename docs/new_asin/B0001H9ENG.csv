2001316,1,B0001H9ENG,"I didn't care for this when it aired, over 60 years ago, and it took about 5 minutes for me to remember why.
Westerns were big, and pretty much owned prime time, and this was one of the worst.  There was better writing in comic books, and better acting in puppet shows.",1481932800,3,269,4.173076923076923
2001317,5,B0001H9ENG,I never heard of this prior to downloading it for my weekly flights throughout the USA.  Excellent storylines and good characters.  Sad this show only lasted one season. I grew up near NOLA and enjoyed the references.,1479600000,,217,4.837837837837838
2001318,5,B0001H9ENG,This is a great classic western with a twist in the setting. Interesting stories and characters. I am really surprised there isn't a second season. It reminds me of Paladin in a way. Any fan of Westerns will enjoy Yancy Derringer.,1478736000,5,230,4.634146341463414
2001319,5,B0001H9ENG,"Good clean entertainment, improbable plots full of fun and engaging characters.
Often surprises about who the bad guys/gals are.
Pahoo (Pawnee Indian) is an important part of the glue that keeps Yancy engaging.",1476057600,7,210,5.393939393939394
2001320,5,B0001H9ENG,One of my all time favorite TV programs.  Been looking for this for years.  A program that honors the red man and invents cool.  Yancy was the first Sonny Crockett.  Invented industrial strength COOL.  Can't believe Amazon has the series on Prime.  Dude am I fortunate.,1472083200,14,269,4.739130434782608
2001321,4,B0001H9ENG,"This is one of the classic cheesy 50's TV westerns.  The quality is a little shakey as to be expected for video from that period.  It is great fun to watch and enjoy the ""innocense of the age"".

Ran from 2 October to 24 September 1959. Half hour western set in New Orleans after the Civil War. With Jock Mahoney as Yancy Derringer, a suave and stylishly dressed bon vivant who carried the pistol for which he was known for in his hat; X Brands as Pahoo, Yancy's silent and unsimiling Indian companion, who always kept a knife in his headdress (Pahoo's full name, Pahoo Ka Ta Wah, was Pawnee for Wolf Who Stands in Water). Kevin Hagen as John Colton, the beleaguered city administrator of New Orleans. Frances Bergen (mother of Candy Bergen)as Madame Francine, one of Yancy's female friends.

Theme Song

They sing of Yancey Derringer

On every danger trail,

On riverboat, in manor house

And now and then in jail.

They say that Yancy Derringer

Had ruffles at his wrists,

Brocade and silver buckles

And iron in his fists.

Yancy, Yancy Derringer,

Yancy, Yancy Derringer

In every tale of derring do

They tell of Yancy D.",1167436800,8,1613,4.647686832740214
2001323,5,B0001H9ENG,"I had never heard of Yancy Derringer before, but after watching Kit Carson and the Lone Ranger this showed up in the suggested Prime shows.  My children thoroughly enjoyed it as did my husband and I.  In fact, my husband would watch a couple of episodes ahead after the children went to bed.  There was plenty of humor and some innuendo that thankfully went right over my kids' heads but was appreciated by the adults.  My boys really got into this and had arguments over who got to be Pahoo (sp?)  It's a truly enjoyable watch, you should give it a try.",1506988800,,554,4.392156862745098

2001325,5,B0001H9ENG,"I  watched this series in the late 50""s when I was 16 years old.  The cast and the plot lines were very entertaining
to me.  I was very pleased to see Amazon  showing these. THANKS SO MUCH.",1503360000,,189,4.027027027027027
2001326,4,B0001H9ENG,Made it all the way through the entire 33 episodes. Breezily rapid pace to episodes' plotting and not altogether repetitious in storylines.. Glad that it was more light-hearted than the melodramatic prairie noir so favored by most better known counterparts like Gunsmoke & Bonanza. Only oater I favor more is Have Gun Will Travel which was noir indeed.,1503100800,3,352,5.086206896551724
2001327,5,B0001H9ENG,Yancy Derringer....have not seen these episodes in 59 years. They however stand the test of time..action romance intrigue comedy. All present here as you work your way through the fine old time clean TV days. When America had morals,1503100800,4,232,4.9743589743589745

2001331,5,B0001H9ENG,"yancy derringer! he was the love of my (little-girl) life! i never thought i'd EVER get to see this program again. we all lived in a black and white world of simpler times back when this was new. there was good and evil, right and wrong, and modesty and decorum and the shows we watched on our big box tvs always always ended with right triumphing over wrong. (i'm watching it on prime streaming, now, laptop resting on my lounging form..who'd a thunk it back then?) . is the program simple? Hokey? of course! just sit back and enjoy it. its the 1950's and in America then, everything is right with the world.",1494115200,4,609,4.398230088495575
2001332,5,B0001H9ENG,"How did I miss this?

Growing up, I knew all the shows on at this time, but not this one. It's truly terrific. If you want to know how to move your show or movie along at engaging pace without nauseating editing, tasteless swearing, and an inclusive story line, watch this series.

While it was filmed on the cheap (library music, studio movie archives), the stories are jam-packed. Then there are the action scenes. Mahoney was a stunt man and continuously amazes with his leaps, flips, and falls. He's a handsome fellow, as is Pahoo (played by a German!). Then there is a steady stream of beautiful ladies.

The last episodes open up the story so Yancy is spending more time away from New Orleans. Perhaps this was a nod to what the producers had planned for a second season. But it was not to be.

When I realized I'd gotten to the last episode, I was sad.",1492819200,5,859,4.417721518987341
2001333,5,B0001H9ENG,"JML wrote in his review that Jock Mahoney is very much like Clark Gable in this New Orleans story.  I do see the similarities but I also think that the show could almost be called The Saint in Old New Orleans.  Like the Saint, the ""Robin Hood of modern crime"", Yancy Derringer is cool, sophisticated, impeccably dressed, adventurous, intelligent, funny in a dry sort of way, a good friend and a dangerous enemy, a gentleman but a bit of a rogue, a lady's man, lacking in ""proper"" respect for law and authority but still one of the good guys, and a fierce fighter.  Why this series was not more successful, I don't know.  Part of it was probably its time slot.  Maybe its treatment of men such as George Custer and Jesse James who, in the 50's & 60's, were considered to be American icons by many didn't sit well with much of the audience.  I do know that it is entertaining even if some of the plots are a little silly.

I streamed these programs via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1489104000,5,996,4.32258064516129
2001334,5,B0001H9ENG,"Yancey was cool and tough,Pahoo was loyal and tougher than a SuperHero,and Yancey treats him with ultimate respect.
Beautiful women,New Orleans,1868,what's not to like. Been missing this one. Made my day to see it on Prime.",1486252800,3,223,5.222222222222222
2001335,5,B0001H9ENG,"I had never heard of this series before and I'm over 50. This was a delightful little find. It's not exactly a western, although there is the obvious link to the Lone Ranger and Tonto. The feel is a bit more like Zorro in some ways, full of chivalry. The set-up is like Batman, with a vigilante working secretly for the government, but outside the law.
The real surprise for me was Pahoo. There are so many reasons for me not to like the character: He is played by a German. He doesn't speak. He is a sidekick only. He is sometimes referred to as a Savage and even worse. YET, I couldn't help but like the character. Pahoo was played with serious intensity by X Brands. I simply couldn't take my eyes off of him.
A few of the episodes are silly, but most are pretty entertaining. I even started to like some of the secondary characters: The pickpocket with a conscience, the owner of the gentlemen's club, the governor, the wild west partner.
Just watch a couple of episodes and see if you end up liking it as so many others did.",1484956800,2,1029,4.309278350515464
2001336,5,B0001H9ENG,"I love old movies, and this is no exception. Jock Mahoney is very much like Clark Gable in these New Orleans placed stories. He just exudes charm and the humor  and verbal volleys are well planned and timed perfectly. He probably did his own stunts and was pretty fearless. The character of Pahoo is definitely treated with respect. As old as this show is, it is better to me than more than half of what is on T.V. today. I love looking up the stars, too, and reading of their careers. Has anyone noticed that the last bit of Yancy's theme is the melody for Popeye the Sailor, which was written by a Romanian composer called Lerner in 1933. Tunes were often shared in that era with a little more abandon than now. Of course, it could be a coincidence, but the last line sure sounds the same! Best part? Free with Prime!",1484870400,,819,4.352941176470588
2001337,5,B0001H9ENG,Most excellent. Enjoyed when it came out on tv the first time and enjoy it again. Thank you for the good memory.  Funy how they don't know how to say New Orleans.

The acting was great and the stories and writing was great.
  Honestly, they just don't make a tv series more enjoyable than this one.
