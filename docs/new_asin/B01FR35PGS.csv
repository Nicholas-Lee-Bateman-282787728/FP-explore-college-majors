8761316,1,B01FR35PGS,"Tortuously tedious camcorder/surveillance video thriller about a California couple who house swap with a couple in England.  Things disappear, they hear mysterious noises, someone leaves a turd on their bathroom floor--but the intruder keeps getting in even though the doors and windows are all locked and he somehow is never caught on the surveillance cameras--and the couple films it all, just like real people would!

I have hated this particular horror genre for nearly as long as it has existed.  Camcorder/surveillance camera horror films are very rarely good and are almost always largely boring, filled with people doing nothing interesting footage that would never make it into a conventional horror film.  The movies almost never come up for a plausible excuse for why what we are seeing is being filmed--which is definitely the case here.  The last thing two real people being stalked in the middle of the night would do is carry around a camcorder.  Seriously, how stupid do the filmmakers think the audience is?

There is a locked door inside the house that the couple doesn't have a key to, so anybody with functioning brain cells will figure out how the intruder is getting in and out long before the characters in the movie do.  House Swap is a bad entry in an already completely played out genre that offers no suspense or surprises, two very stupid characters that it is impossible to root for and what turns out to be some of the longest 85 minutes that you might ever endure while sitting through a movie.  House Swap is so boring and stupid that it is virtually impossible to watch all the way to the end.  Do yourself a very big favor and don't even begin to watch this one.",1490832000,,1696,4.757679180887372
