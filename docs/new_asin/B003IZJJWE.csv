4128687,5,B003IZJJWE,"I watched this as a youth and it had me enthralled.  Today, I'm still enthralled with great views of the ""century"" Air Force fighters and other aircraft of the era.  This is not gripping drama with stand-out performances by the actors but that's not what its meant to be.  It's easy and fun to watch.",1390089600,3,300,4.418181818181818

4128689,4,B003IZJJWE,I purchased this along with another Steve Canyon dvd set for my Dad. He enjoyed this program growing up and I am glad to help him relive those times. It is a good show.,1362355200,,168,3.9705882352941178
4128690,5,B003IZJJWE,"Having grown up overseas on Air Force Bases and then served myself in the USAF, I love looking back on the ways things were. They were good, and bad, and the reliability of the century series aircraft in 50's 60's, and 70's was not great, as I understand the stories were based on real events, and I can recall a few as a kid. Huge thanks go out to one man who had taken on this huge project, take your time and get it right, we waited this long for Vol 3, we can wait a little longer. I would like to go back and spend time on an Air Force base in the 50's and wear the really comfortable 1505 and 1550's.",1360540800,,606,3.934959349593496
4128691,3,B003IZJJWE,I enjoyed the quality of the Steve Canyon video vol 2 but was kinda taken back because they contained the original ads for cigarettes. A product like this should never be featured in anything. Did enjoy the old videos since this a program that I never had seen during its original run on tv. I will buy the vol 3 if they ever get it released. Always can depend on Amazon.com to get the orders delivered quickly.,1343779200,,411,4.35064935064935
4128692,5,B003IZJJWE,"I own the First DVD as well as Vol 1 and now Volume 2.  If you remember and like the old Steve Canyon TV show or just love to watch Air Force airplanes, you will enjoy these DVD's.

The Steve Canyon series was unique in that it was amazingly detailed and about as realistic as any TV show up to that time and perhaps even since.  It certainly held my interest as a ten-year-old, even though it was probably aimed more to an adult audience than us kids.  But, it was family fair for the times, which meant it is/was harmless and good clean fun.  If you served in the USAF, Steve Canyon was a salute to all those who served and stands to this day as a real tribute to those men who literally dedicated their lives to this honorable service.

These DVD's are monochrome, as were the TV series, but the quality is excellent, certainly better than I remember it from 1958/59.  Even the old commercials are all there and they too bring back memories of another time.

When this short series ran originally, it was my favorite TV show.  And seeing it fifty+ years later, it is just as good.

Too bad we'll probably never think of the USA and the men who serve it like that ever again.",1287792000,,1177,4.261261261261262
4128693,5,B003IZJJWE,"The Steve Canyon series was made with the cooperation of the Air Force and meets that high standard in regards to entertainment.
I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys:intelligent adventure stories, Air Force memorabilia or classic tv.",1286841600,6,247,5.358974358974359
4128694,5,B003IZJJWE,"""The Complete Steve Canyon on TV--Volume 2"" continues in the tradition of the first volume in the series, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Steve-Canyon-On-TV-Volume-1/dp/B002WG73VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Steve Canyon On TV - Volume 1</a>,"" which set the quality bar very high indeed. Containing another 12 episodes (of a total of 36) of the outstanding live-action 1958-59 television series featuring renowned cartoonist Milton Caniff's popular character, U.S. Air Force pilot and troubleshooter Colonel Stevenson B. Canyon, this is a remarkable DVD set. Even though these shows first aired more than 50 years ago (it hardly seems possible!), Colonel Canyon's wide-ranging aerial adventures, filmed in glorious black-and-white, should appeal to nearly everyone. You'll find just the right blend of action, suspense and romance here, along with lots of stunning aerial footage of fascinating, now-classic early-jet-age U.S. aircraft, filmed with the full cooperation of the Air Force.

The 12 30-minute episodes in this set were broadcast from November 15, 1958, through April 14, 1959. They are all meticulously restored from the original 35mm film broadcast masters, and all are exceptionally crisp and sharp, with outstanding contrast and excellent sound quality. Every episode has a fascinating and relevant audio commentary track. Commentators include producer John Ellis of the Milton Caniff Estate, aviation film historian James H. Farmer, television historian Brad Ulvila, filmmaker Peter Kuran and series actors Richard Anderson, Abel Hernandez, Robert Hoy and Sylvia Lewis. All also include ABC network promo spots and vintage commercials. There's a main menu with episode thumbnails, and each episode has thumbnailed chapter stops. The quality and production values of the DVDs and the packaging are superior. The episodes themselves are superb. Each one is a half-hour of pure enjoyable escapism into a retro-world of roaring jets, aerial perils, steely eyed pilots and ""girl-next-door"" sweethearts. This is better than ""the right stuff."" This is ""the great stuff!""

I most enthusiastically and unconditionally give ""The Complete Steve Canyon on TV--Volume 2"" the highest possible recommendation. It's very unlikely that television viewers will ever again see the likes of such an outstanding series. Buy it and enjoy!",1278547200,11,2397,5.985422740524782
4128695,4,B003IZJJWE,"Now I've seen all three Steve Canyon Discs because the story behind this series is sometimes better than the series itself. The quality of the restoration has been consistent, and the behind the scenes info offered by this versions producer is a great way to learn about tv production in the 50's. Great educational tool. Wish there was a companion book with all the photos and info on the blog site. If anyone is interested in TV history, this is a great show to study.",1276473600,6,470,4.541176470588235

8397803,5,B003IZJJWE,These original b&w episodes not only give stories (including commercials) actually set in the 50's but they include historical footage of the most advanced jets and rockets of this era.

8397805,5,B003IZJJWE,"I loved Steve Canyon as a kid and the series inspired me to become a pilot. I was overjoyed when I learned the series would return on DVD.  I purchased Vol. 1 & 2 and have had hours of high altitude adventure from the Cold-War days.  I have preordered Vol. 3 which is due out in April 2014.  The DVD's are crisp and faithful renditions of the former series, even including the commerial ads!  Each DVD also includes additional material that adds to the enjoyment of the series.  So, listen up; if you love adventure, aerial and on the ground, and love B-52's , F-100's, C-47's, and the history these pilots and planes made, be sure to line-up on film-final for many happy landings!",1395360000,,681,4.459677419354839
