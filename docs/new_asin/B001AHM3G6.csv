8326259,4,B001AHM3G6,"I liked this show when it was on TLC and was happy to be able to buy it on DVD. The problem is that the DVDs aren't numbered in the box, and the DVDs themselves have no startup menu to tell you which episodes are on the disc. So you have a set of DVDs which are all identically labeled, and you can't tell what's on which disc until you put one in the machine and start to watch it. Otherwise they're fine to watch.",1327276800,2,415,3.8941176470588235
