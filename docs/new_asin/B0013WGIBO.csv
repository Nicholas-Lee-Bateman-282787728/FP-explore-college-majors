8326086,5,B0013WGIBO,"Very informative DVD on how pervasive this drug has become in our society. The DVD helps the viewer understand the power of this drug and how it destroys lives and families...it is not a ""casual drug""...once taken, this drug destroys.  This is a very powerful DVD; highly recommend.  Also take note of the Teachers Guide available at Moonshadow Productions website; very helpful!",1344643200,,379,5.096774193548387
8326087,5,B0013WGIBO,"This video should be seen by every teenager and young adult in America! I just watched this movie with my family and it clearly explains why meth is so addictive and destructive to the user and to our communities.  It also shows how our lives and our health are really about the choices we all make on a daily basis.  'Choose Life or Choose Meth' is the most empowering drug prevention video I have ever seen!  As a mother, I highly recommend that every parent of teens sit down and watch this movie with them.",1202774400,3,510,4.347368421052631
