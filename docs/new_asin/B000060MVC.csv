7957619,2,B000060MVC,"How can you tell of the fall of the USSR without even mentioning Reagan's name? Also, they claim that Lenin's New Economic Pokicy (a return to limited capitalism) failed due to the famine. Actually, NEP was done to fix the famine caused by radical socialist policies and it was very successful until Stalin dumped it in favor of forced collectivization, which caused a new famine. Oh, liberals!",1385856000,,394,4.895522388059701

7957621,3,B000060MVC,"Why 3 Stars?  A balance between the 5 stars this presentation would receive on what it DOES cover, and the 1 star is would receive because of what it DOES NOT.  Presented is a major network news documentary with interviews.  The date of the news show explains the why part of what is covered and also the why of what was not.  However the release date of the DVD would have permitted the inclusion of other pertinent material.

This documentary does an excellent job in presenting an overview of the foundation of Marxist-Leninist communism and the spread of Soviet control over the nations of central and eastern Europe.  It also does a fine job in examining the decline and fall of communism in those central and eastern European nations.

However, this documentary is totally deficient in its examination of the fall of communism within Russia and the other republics which had once comprised the Soviet Union.  While some of these republics do receive minor mention, most are totally overlooked.  The discussion concludes in the mid-Gorbachev years, well before the final disintegration of the Soviet Union.  Imagine a documentary about Christmas which wraps up on December 23.

I remember watching the final lowering of the Soviet flag over the Kremlin and the raising of the Russian flag in its place.  A piece entitled `The Fall of Communism' cannot exclude such a significant occurrence and still be worthy of its name.",1317254400,,1427,4.924686192468619
7957622,5,B000060MVC,"This documentary provides and excellent overview of the history of the Soviet Union, and it does a great job of covering the fall of communism!",1273968000,,143,4.76
7957623,3,B000060MVC,"They kind of pass over important events. Like Soviet involvement in Korea, Vietnam. They also fail to show that if such a ""monster"" moves, reacts, launches initiative to conquer, it is in reaction toward another ""monters"" move.

They fail to show the ""why""'s of Soviets international decisions. This is because they solely focus on Russia, which is useless for a documentary about Russia. They HAVE to explain US & NATO moves also so we understand a little bit better the whole picture.

Nonetheless, this documentary still hold some interesting information about former CCCP, but presented in some boring way because of the above issue.

Documentary was out in 1990, so don't expect to get a present picture of Russia and it's ex-sattelites.",1096329600,9,742,5.065573770491803
