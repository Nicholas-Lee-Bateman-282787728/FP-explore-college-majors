8291872,5,B001D68NCW,This video is a travelogue on the Royal Scotsman and as a train buff it was enjoyable to imagine traveling on a luxury train through Scotland. The train cars are amazing in their decorating and detail. I've never been to Scotland and probably never will so it was fun to see the countryside and the cities the train travel through. The video was taped in 1999 so it may be dated but still it was worth viewing. I have watched it several times over now and still continue to enjoy it.,1404604800,2,483,4.318681318681318
8291873,2,B001D68NCW,"Shot in 1998, this is at heart an hour-long advertisement for the service and not as scenic as you might expect; it rains for most of the five-day tour. Still, for those of us with neither the money nor the time for such luxury (champagne instead of tea at 4 p.m.) a little escapism can be a good thing--and the price is right.",1242086400,3,327,4.2063492063492065
