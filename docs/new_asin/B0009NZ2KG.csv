2303865,4,B0009NZ2KG,"A heartwarming story with a wonderful doggie star.  It was the movie that majorly introduced the Berger Picard (aka Picardy Shepherd) breed of dog (yes, the mutt-looking dog in the movie is a rare-breed purebred dog) to many people.  The breed is now gradually re-gaining popularity, after having been decimated to near extinction in the World Wars (much of the fighting was in it's home territory of Picardie, France).  This movie actually helped in the breed's eventual resurrection, without subjecting it to dangerous over-popularity, since the breed type was never disclosed or discussed in the film.

The script, characters, and acting are all fine for a younger audience, and fun for an older one.  It's not great film, but is entertaining if such a story appeals to you.  It's based on a popular children's book of the same name.

Enjoy!

PS The five Berger Picards (called ""Picards"" for short), interchangeably used In the movie, were all imported from France;  and were then subsequently used for other roles in commercials, theater, etc.  There is now a Picard being used in one Geico commercial (the dripping ceiling one), and previously in other ads.  The breed has recently been officially accepted into the American Kennel Club, and can be seen at some shows, etc., in this country, as well as in a variety of performance events;  including, of course, sheepherding.

And yes, some do ""smile"", just like in the movie!  :  )",1504483200,3,1437,4.953974895397489

This is a great book for grade school kids (and adults), with well-drawn characters, good plot development, and enough depth to make for interesting book discussions.  I also got the movie (from Amazon) and she enjoyed it, too, while I enjoyed her comments on his the movie differed from the book.

Opal makes friends with the librarian, the woman others believe is a witch, and a somewhat strange store manager, among others. But what will happen if, as her neighbor threatens, Winn-Dixie is given to the pound? And will Opal be able to bring together the very different people of the town?

Because of Winn Dixie is a great movie for children that explores friendships, growing up in a single household, and seeing other people's struggles. Although Christ is not the center of the movie, there is some Christian input.",1468972800,,678,4.794871794871795

2304367,5,B0009NZ2KG,"I watched this last night with my grandkids.  I thought I was going to wash dishes while they watched, but I got absorbed in the movie immediately, and the dishes waited till after 10 o'clock.  I'm pretty much a sucker for dog movies, but this was more than a dog movie.  The little girl was  an excellent actress, and could really melt an adult's heart.  Cecily Tyson was excellent and a real joy to watch.  But what I like the very most about this movie was it's lack of political correctness!  I mean, I was absolutely floored when the librarian, Eva Marie Saint, recommended that Opal read ""Gone With the Wind"" to Cecily Tyson's character!  And she did it, and apparently old Miss Gloria liked it.  This story of Scarlett O'hara inspired the party they had.  And the confederate soldier who had so much sorrow in his life because of the tragedy of war and coming home to the deaths of his whole family, was a town hero who started the candy company that made such a UNIQUE candy, as well as giving jobs to many men.  I just loved this.  But what is sad is I don't think that today, just 11 short years after this movie was made, this kind of movie with so much goodness, and lack of idealogy, could be made.  Please watch it with your children or grandchildren.  You will have a lovely experience.",1466553600,,1301,4.389121338912134

2304586,5,B0009NZ2KG,"Loved it! It does a nice job of keeping kids engaged and staying with the critical themes of the book. It's one of the best book to movie transitions I have ever worked with. Although some things are added/rearranged, the kids recognize the characters as they are represented in the novel. Also, Dave Matthews as Otis was a really nice added element for those of us old enough to still remember him. The officer who harassed him is silly and although some may say unnecessary, I think he's hilarious and breaks up some of the raw emotion of loss and suffering that undercuts the book and film. I watch it every year after the read aloud and will now have the pleasure of streaming it rather than trying to locate a decent copy from a friend or colleague.",1455580800,3,754,4.471014492753623

2304643,4,B0009NZ2KG,"Jeff Daniels proves yet again that he can play any role from one of the leads in Dumb and Dumber to George Washington.  In this film he plays a single-parent minister moving into a new town with his tweenage daughter.  She's lonely in a new town where things just don't seem to be working out.  Then Winn-Dixie happens.

If you like cute dog movies then this is a film made for you.  Why is life good?  Because of Winn-Dixie.

Watch for fun cameo appearances by Dave Matthews of the Dave Matthews Band.  He even sings.

This is a fantastic, watchable film for the younger kid crowd.  And for them it's a 5-star movie.  For the older crowd, however, it's probably a 3-4 star event.  All in all I give it a solid 4 stars.

I like Jeff Daniels, and for that alone it's worth watching once (at least)",1452470400,,796,4.297297297297297

In some parts or maybe a lot of parts it made me cry because the acting was spectacular and the movie itself wasn't something that could never happen,  it was relatable. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie, or a family movie or has a dog of their own that they love. I think anyone and everyone would enjoy it because its sad but not sappy.",1452297600,,435,4.117647058823529

2304998,4,B0009NZ2KG,"My students recently read this book then watched the movie right after.  I have chosen three different reviews of this movie comparing it to the book.  This is a SPOILER ALERT, from three different students.  If you would like to read what good 4th grade writing looks like please continue.

  MK-  I have recently finished reading Because of Winn Dixie in my 4th grade class.  we later watched the movie.  After watching the movie we came up with quite a few opinions.  Here are just a few.
  One thing that the book and movie have in common is the preacher telling Opal ten things about her mom.  (The mom was missing in both the book and movie.)  The difference was that in the book they sat on a couch in the middle of the day and formally talked about all ten things.  That happens right after Winn-Dixie was cleaned and he was sitting up on the couch with them.  In the movie however they talked while Winn Dixie ran around the trailer during a thunderstorm.  However the big difference is that in the book the preacher told Opal all 10 things at once and in the movie he told Opal the 10th thing later.  I think that the movie was trying to prove the point by doing this.  I think that the movie did this in a very creative and clever way. However the book showed more emotion.
  Something that the book and movie barely share are the problems.  The movie's main problems are Winn-Dixie going to the pound and Otis being captured by the police.  You can barely see that the problem of loneliness exists.  However in the book, the other two problems don't exist and the only problem is loneliness.  Any other problems would surround that.  I think that the movie's problem is not as mature as the books.
  My final opinion is that though the movie was a little disappointing it is still fun to watch.  It was also fun to pick out all the litter differences afterwards.  Though the movie and the book are both very similar and good I would recommend the book for older kids and the movie for younger kids if you're reading it in a specific age group.  However if you're looking for a family movie this is great for you.

HG-  There were some minor differences, and differences that had a bigger impact on the movie, but at the same time the movie captured the same idea and meaning as the book.
  One of the things the movie and book share in common is that Opal's mom doesn't live with her.  She lost her mom when she was only three years old, and doesn't know much about her.  Another thing that the movie and book share is that Opal comes up with the same resolution.  She realizes that even if she doesn't have her mom, she has friends to make up for that.  Finally, in both the movie and book Gloria Dump (one of Opal's friends) has a mistake tree.  Every single time Gloria Dump makes a mistake she puts up a bottle of glass and it reminds her of all the bad things she's done in her life.
  One of the differences between the book and movie is that in the movie, there's a character whose name is Mr. Alfred, the boss of the trailer park where Opal's family lives.  Who adds more of a funny twist to the movie.  But in the book there was no such character as Mr. Alfred nor a trailer park owner.  Finally, one difference between the movie and book is that in the movie, there was a scene where Winn-Dixie, was about to go to the pound.  But Opal begged the Preacher to keep him, so he didn't go.  However, in the book, there wasn't a scene where Winn-Dixie was about to go to the pound.
  In my opinion, I would say the general age range for this movie would probably be for six through eight years old.  The reason I say this is because they add funny characters like Mr. Alfred, and a police officer.  They add these characters for a ""comical relief"", because otherwise the movie would probably be too serious for younger audiences.  I would give the movie 3 stars, but the book 4.  I would recommend this movie for people who like parrots, dogs, a balance between humor and more serious things, and funny police officers, too!

HS-  My class recently finished reading Because of Winn Dixie, then we watched the movie and I have a few things to say about the movie.
  In the book when Opal is ""talking"" to her mom, Dunlap Dewberry helps her up and races her back to Gloria Dump's house.  But in the movie Dunlap and Stevie Dewberry came to help her up and then raced each other back to the house.  In the movie for kid comedy Gertrude the white parrots says, ""Shut up, idiot!"" Yet in the book Gertrude only says, ""Gertrude's a pretty bird!"" and ""Dog!""
  In the book and movie Opal's mom left her I think without this detail both would not be the same.  Another thing in both book and movie is that Sweetie Pie Thomas spit out her Littmus Lozenge and said ""It tastes like not having a dog.""  I feel that this shows that even five-year old have some sadness in their life.
  Personally after reading the book for about a month I was disappointed by the movie.  The movie was a little too kid-like for me.  Sure I laughed, but it just didn't work for me.  I would suggest this movie for second to fourth graders, but it just wasn't my style.",1418256000,,5152,4.319037656903766

2305032,5,B0009NZ2KG,"Based on the best-selling book with the same movie, title: BECAUSE OF WINN DIXIE, this delightful family film will encourage and inspire everyone. It is heart-warming to be sure, because it centers on a little girl who lost her mom by way of desertion and divorce, and who is now, being raised by her lonely, father. She wants a dog and her dad finally relents and lets her adopt a scruffy dog, whom she names: Winn Dixie. Intially, the property landlord and some neighbors who have experienced Winn Dixie's somewhat rambunctious, attention-getting, manner..., are not to thrilled at Winn Dixie's obnoxious presence. And so, begins the battle to even keep him around. But, he's really not a bad dog. He's only trying to tell them something? But what? Because, only a handful of people are actually willing to open their hearts, to hear and see..., what he is trying to tell them. And ironically, it is because of Winn Dixies' efforts, that friends, neighbors, landlords and the mischief makers ""...those boys"", who change for the better and come together, as a united community. A though-to-be, scrappy dog, did all this? Yup! A loveable, scappy dog with a perceptive mind of his own, did it all. So, pop the popcorn and gather the family around, to watch and see what message(s) Winn Dixie was trying to convey and how, he finally did it?! Nina Kish",1416873600,,1350,4.773504273504273

It does deal with some of life's difficulties, such as fears, divorce, parental abandonment, loneliness, insecurity, etc. Many of them are either somewhat healed or overcome, by the end of the movie.

Dave Matthews plays a delightful character, and sings several songs during the movie.

2305531,3,B0009NZ2KG,"This movie is based off of a cute children's book by the same name.  Don't let the title fool you though, this is about a dog and a girl, not a supermarket.  And it's a good family movie, appropriate for all ages.

Opal is having a boring summer hanging out in the town she and her Preacher father just moved to.  She's having trouble making friends and the loneliness makes her dwell on the loss of her mother, who left them when she was three.  So when Opal comes across a stray dog at the local Winn-Dixie, she brings him home, despite the trailer court rules against animals.  But Winn-Dixie (as she calls him) opens her world up and helps her make new friends.

Characters:
AnnaSophia Robb: Opal Buloni
Jeff Daniels: Opal's father
Cicely Tyson: Gloria Dump
Luke Benward: Steven Dewberry
Dave Matthews: Otis
Eva Marie Saint: Ms. Franny Block

The characters are actually where this movie is kind of weak.  Robb does a decent job as Opal.  She's certainly childlike and whimsical and she has a friendly personality.  But Daniels as her father was unconvincing, like he didn't know what type of father he wanted to be and never really figured it out through the whole movie.  Gloria Dump, played by Tyson, was a little stange.  A local witch figure you were supposed to see past the rumors, but even if she did have a good heart, she still wasn't the most comforting of people.  The same could apply to Otis and Franny Block as well, the other adult friends that Opal makes.  Personally if I were her dad I'd want to at least meet these people.  And then there's the five year old child running around loose with no supervision.  Maybe it's because I grew up in a large town, but yeesh!  And then there's the policeman.  They made this poor guy the stupidest person in the whole movie, which since this is a kid's movie, might not be the best thing to project.

The plot followed the book well enough.  It could be meandering at times, and some of the stories were a little out there.  This is one that kids will probably get a lot more enjoyment out of than adults.  Although there are some parts adults might enjoy.  I have to say that I liked the book better, but that seems to be the case with most things.  At any rate, since this is a kid's movie, there's nothing inappropriate contained within it (except for one minor cuss word) and the kids all learn the lessons of learning about people before judging, who real family is, and other such sappy things.

The film was shot nicely.  It had an old time feel to it even though Opal's dad had a laptop.  It certainly took place in a quaint town.  The dog trainers were very good, as Winn Dixie was always on hand for a smile or a trick (I still can't figure out if that dog is actually smiling or if they altered the video to make it look like he was).  If they did alter it, it was a good job.  And Gloria's house was an especially beautiful set.  There was some music, but it was mostly background and hymn music, so I didn't really pay attention to it.  The one character was a guitar player, and he played a few nice tunes, but no complete songs.

A cute movie for kids but probably not as popular with the older crowd.  They could clean up the meandering plotline a bit and probably have something a bit more popular.  But as is, this is an average movie.

It is definitely ""family entertainment"" and a fun movie!",1360195200,,266,4.541666666666667

2305564,5,B0009NZ2KG,"My daughter loves this movie about a girl who finds a dog, names it and takes it home. They have fun and get into trouble together. There is a part about how the girl's mom left her and her father a long time go, and my daughter had trouble understandung that, but she didn't let it ruin the story for her.",1358812800,,306,4.032786885245901
2305585,4,B0009NZ2KG,"I'll warn everyone upfront that this review is coming from a Christian perspective and is primarily directed at Christians that might want to purchase this:

This is a fairly unique ""family friendly"" movie that generally produces praise from many that watch it. It is an entertaining, charming, ""feel good"" movie that is childlike without really being too childish. Most people will be able to identify with one or more of the people in this movie since most people have experienced loneliness or rejection at some point in their life. Kids (I'm thinking 8 and up) and adults alike can enjoy this movie.  The DVD has both widescreen and full-screen editions on the disc.  The Blu-ray, which I've also seen, is noticeably clearer and is the best way to watch this movie - I highly recommend the Blu-ray!

As a Christian, I did have 1 pretty big issue with this movie, however. And it isn't with how they portrayed the preacher father (they showed him as a human being with faults like everyone else), although I do wish he had come across a little differently. My main concern with this movie has more to do with its central message: Basically the message of the movie is that we've all got issues/burdens in our lives and that the way to freedom is just to share those burdens with others and open our hearts to others. Basically a ""mutual exchange"" - you share your burdens with me, I share mine with you.

While love is to be a trademark of Christianity and certainly part of loving people is to be real with people and ""love one another"" - and this does involve helping people in love to release their burdens, the problem with this movie is that they are never released to God, but rather people. The girl in the movie talks about a part of her that hurts so bad since she's missing her mama that feels like a ""hole"" in her of sorts, but the movie never showcases, discusses, or in any way insinuates that Jesus wants to help with that hurt and to fill those holes in her (or anyone else). This movie doesn't provide a message that God wants to help us in our loneliness or hurts - and that that, in fact, is part of what is available to us in Christ. Rather, the message is that we just need to love one another and share with one another. The object becomes humanity rather than God.

For what this movie is: a realization that there are hurting people around us and we all need love and acceptance, and even unconditional love (as expressed in the movie by a dog), it is a pretty good movie. But that's pretty much as far as the movie will take you, and it actually insinuates that our need for love and acceptance can be adequately filled by people, as opposed to a realization that people are flawed and we need a love deeper than mere human love - we need to accept the love of our Creator that loves us with a perfect, everlasting love.

I have heard that the book this is based on comes across more ""new agey"" than it is portrayed in the movie. That doesn't surprise me because a central theme of people with ""new age"" type beliefs is that humanity just needs to love people more to solve all its problems (as opposed to loving God more which then leads to loving people more - there's a difference).

At the end of the day, I do believe this movie MIGHT be a decent movie to help ""jumpstart"" thought and discussion so it could potentially be a good ""family night"" type of movie, but I would say good follow-up discussion would be warranted - bringing out some of the things I discussed above and using this movie to springboard into talking about how Jesus wants to be our ""best friend"" - that as Christians we're never truly alone, etc.

I'd rented it from Netflix and am now ordering it so I can see it whenever I please and watch it with my friends.

2305621,5,B0009NZ2KG,"My daughter and I had read the book and wanted to see how the movie compared. The book is better (as are most books) but as far as kids movies go, this one's a winner. The kids are cute and not sassy, like on many sitcoms. The adults are more than 1-dimensional. The relationships between the characters are nuanced, but not too complex for an 8 year old girl to understand. Really great family movie.",1351296000,,401,4.36

She fell in LOVE with the movie and there must have been a straight month where she asked to watch it multiple times a day.  She loved it so much that I wanted to purchase the DVD for our car trip.  It's the cutest movie that teaches little ones about relationships with animals and people after moving to a new town.  I had never seen it before and as much as she watches it, I haven't gotten sick of it yet!",1341964800,,542,3.944954128440367

2305655,4,B0009NZ2KG,"I actually purchased this movie in a combined package that included the book, but there are so many elements that are best viewed in a movie, that I can't help but recommend the movie itself.

Perhaps as a pastor myself I understand the perspectives better, or maybe it is just that my Dad moved a lot when we were kids that I can relate to being in a new community.

Moments that stand out in the movie:
The bottles in the tree that speak to the haunting of one member
Winn Dixie joining with the singing
The approaching storm and the panic of Winn Dixie related to thunder

This is very much a family movie and I recommend it.",1330300800,,628,4.260504201680672
2305656,3,B0009NZ2KG,"As a children's/family movie, this is nearly perfect!  With a whimsical flair, ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" entertains with delight.  Each of the characters stands very vividly on his/her own, and serve to make this an almost perfectly scripted and acted movie!

The only thing negative in this review is Amazon's ""Instant"" digital rental.  We have had interruptions to our movie streaming almost every time we watch an Amazon Instant movie, and this time it was particularly poor.  There were 20-25 interruptions, each one lasting 15 to 45 seconds.  And when we complained to Amazon, all we received in return was someone suggesting that we check our internet connection.  We have not had any streaming problems on Netflix or Hulu.  Simply put, Amazon is brilliant at selling merchandise and shipping it quickly, but is not yet ready for the streaming digital entertainment market.  We will not be purchasing any more movie rentals from Amazon for a while!

2305659,5,B0009NZ2KG,"I love this movie. It is a well made version of the famous book by the same name. I'm not going to review the movie here. I do have this on regular DVD. When I bought my Blu Ray player I was deciding what movies I was going to replace. This actually wasn't originally one of them. There weren't any spectacular (or so I thought) scenes here that would be improved upon. I was wrong. I never saw this movie on the big screen. But now I know what it must have looked like. The color in general and the sky scenes in particular were beautiful. I don't have a 5.1 surround sound system, but I do have a Dolby Pro Logic Surround  Sound system. Even with this the thunderstorm was so real my niece thought it was really happening outside. I am very pleased with this product.",1303171200,2,769,4.195945945945946

2305672,5,B0009NZ2KG,"I liked this movie, I did not really get the few negative reviews. My kids ages 6 and 8 liked it too. It gets discouraging that it is so hard now days to find a movie that actually does not have cussing or sexuality in it. Even Disney movies have things inappropriate for children at times, and I am not prude. This is a movie a teacher could actually show in a classroom, my son watched it in 2nd grade. It is heartwarming and the dog is adorable.
The only negative thing I would say was the sheriff deputy. I guess the writers were trying to make his parts funny, but they came off as really dumb. I can overlook that though, because I liked the rest.",1278720000,2,653,4.149606299212598
2305673,2,B0009NZ2KG,"I don't understand the marketing plan for this movie.  Is it meant to be for children?  It's not funny -- in fact, it's maudlin.  It's like ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" with a dog and fewer lesbians.  Is it meant to be for grown-ups?  Then ... why wasn't it more entertaining?

Jeff Daniels was barely there.  The dog was very cute, but he didn't get enough screen time.

Just not a very good movie.

On the plus side: Little cussing, no violence, no peril, no sexuality.  But why waste 2 hours of your life on it?",1273104000,,508,4.308510638297872

2305719,3,B0009NZ2KG,"I bought this movie for my elderly mother, who likes ""family"" movies--esp. when there are animals involved. We watched it together. She fell asleep. I watched the whole thing, and it isn't terrible, but it also isn't terribly good, either. (Granted, mom does sleep a lot, but this fun yet forgettable flick isn't one to grab and keep one's attention.)

Annasophia Robb as Opal, the main character, is very cute, but not very convincing in her role. Winn Dixie, the other lead actor, is not all that cute (in my opinion), but is a capable actor. He is quite convincing in his role as a dog, I might add. Opal names the shaggy, lovable mut Winn-Dixie, after the name of the grocery store where she finds him as a stray wreaking havoc in the produce section. She goes through the usual troubles that a kid has convincing her parent that she be allowed to keep him.

Opal has recently moved to a small town where she lives with her effete father in a trailer home, and where her dad is ""The Preacher"". Dad is a kindly, if weak, person who is stuck in the sorrow he still suffers because his wife has left them several years ago. Opal tries to understand about her mother. She also tries to make friends, which turns out to be difficult, but interesting. This lonely girl just MUST be able to keep the dog, Winn-Dixie; he's a girls best friend. Her only friend at first, really.

In the course of the show, the assorted figures of the town, each with his own life ""story"", are touched and ultimately brought together because of Winn-Dixie. My favorite figure is the blind, reclusive Gloria brilliantly played by Cicely Tyson. People (the Dewberry brothers, for instance) fear the eccentric elderly woman, but once they get to know her, they find out that she is both friendly and wise. Don't expect everything in this story to make a lot of sense. But it's OK if you are just looking for light diversion.

You might also enjoy the even better family movie featuring a girl and her pet is ""Dreamer"", with Dakota Fanning as a little girl who never gives up on her injured racehorse, Sonador. I know that my mom likes that one. Also, I'm going to read to her Kate DiCamilo's award-winning children's book ""Winn Dixie"" which the movie is based on. I'll let you know what we think of it.

An excellent cast with great acting by young and old alike and includes some well known stars. The story centers around a young girl finding a dog going crazy in a Winn-Dixie and taking it home. What happens after that almost seems magical in a warm-hearted story about a small towns people and how they all come to love a dog. This dog has a true doggy smile that will likely crack you up a few times, but especially when he does it at the pratfalls of the sheriff played by Harland Williams.

Great acting and wonderful story make this DVD a keeper for the whole family. I bought it sight unseen based on reviews here and I am glad I did. This is a must see movie for animal lovers.

2305763,4,B0009NZ2KG,"There are two true stars of this wondrous family movie from 2005 - the Dog, and Dave Matthews. Yes, THAT Dave Matthews (of the Dave Matthews Band). Here, he is given a couple of plaintive guitar solos in his pet shop, and it actually works. Being a DMB Fan, it was sort of ironic to see one of my favorite musicians sitting on the ground next to pigs and rabbits, with a dog and a little girl for an audience, and as 'Otis', his role here is not very well written either. But he is a revelation in the screen time he does have, because I really think he has that *it* factor which makes him watchable no matter what.

Thankfully, this is no Disney flick. So themes of separation, broken families, lies, betrayal and young loneliness are all given due importance. This was crucial to whether the film worked or not, and here it works in spades. The best part is the dog - and yes, they do make him cute and fluffy here and there, but the beast itself looks more like a rough worn horse, and this works as well.

The lead actress isn't exceptional, but brings a light, warm freshness to her role that maybe other actresses could not have. She is India Opal here, a motherless child who has no friends, and her immediate friendship with stranger mongrel 'Winn Dixie' forms the basis of this sweet story.

Like all kid-and-their-dog movies, the duo make new friends (an old woman, an old man, etc) and there is a lost-and-found segment that also seems cliched, but hey, this is solid family entertainment that is absolutely suitable for any age group. I like that there are some movies only full of positive messages for young kids, and this is surely one of them. A rarity these days.",1194825600,3,1681,4.433656957928803

The story focuses on the character played by AnnaSophia Robb, a daughter of a preacher (Jeff Daniels).  If, like me, you are a Christian who is used to negative portrayals of Christians, don't worry.  Yes, Daniel's character is human, but no less so than any other character.  In this case, the portrayal is neutral, with him not being a hypocrite but more being disconnected, partially due to the pain in his life.

There are lessons for community in this film.  The only thing I'd do differently . . . mild spoiler, here . . .  was show transformation in the police officer.  But that is a minor complaint.

2305796,4,B0009NZ2KG,"I read the book ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" before I saw the movie, and the differences are striking. I think the biggest difference is in the dad. Opal's father really lets her down in the movie, like when he stayed home instead of coming to the party. In the book, his shortcomings are more incidental than purposeful. Also, he is more open in the book, as he tells her about her mother's drinking problem right off the bat, without prompting. He seems like a much less adequate parent in the movie, as he is unable to stick to his guns about ANYTHING, and always ends up giving in and giving her what she wants.

The characters looked different than I expected them to. Gloria Dump just seemed like a harmless old lady in the book, but in the movie, she actually LOOKED like a witch. Otis seemed like an old man in the book. The kid's characters were most like what I expected them to be from the book.

There were some elements from the book that I missed, like the bigger role Sweetie Pie played. But overall, I think the movie was well made for its audience, though it wasn't as compelling as the book.",1170633600,2,1104,4.380487804878049
2305797,4,B0009NZ2KG,"While it is very well made and wonderful, the movie does have many differences from the book.  The most obvious is the Preacher's character.  In the book, the Preacher is much more soft and is shown perhaps as a little weak.  In the movie, however, he is much harder and harsher in the way he talks to Opal.  He has less patience and also does not want to keep Winn-Dixie, which differs from the book.  He also does not tell Opal ten things about her mother when she first asks him.  She has to ask him a second time and even then, some of the ten things differ and he only gives her nine initially in the movie.  Like the Preacher, Otis is a little harder character initially in the movie.  In the book, he is presented as a very shy man.  Also, the trailer park owner's character is absent in the book, while the movie brings him into the action.  Another added character is the foolish cop.  The movie seems to have included him for a bit of comedic relief, but he is nowhere to be seen in the book.  Something great in the movie that is absent from the book is that the audience is able to see into Opal's imagination.  Perhaps it is the movie's way of giving the audience a better picture of how she is processing the stories that she is being told.  These differences do not take away from the movie's overall affect, but may be recognized by those that love the book.",1170547200,2,1374,4.254826254826255
2305798,4,B0009NZ2KG,"I usually shy away from movies made after books, but I was pleasantly surprised while watching Kate DiCamilio's ""Because of Winn-Dixie"". To me, the screenwriters did an excellent job of following the story. My main concern had been that the directors would take the story out of Opal's innocent but frank child's perspective, but it stayed very much on that level. There were some differences, like Opal's hair color (red in one, blonde in the other) and Winn-Dixie's attractiveness (ugly in the book, cute in the movie) but overall, I believe the same message was conveyed. In both stories, a small Southern town is brought closer because of a girl's continous adventure to abolish lonliness from her life and the lives of those around her. She accomplished that very thing, and most of it was 'because of Winn-Dixie.'",1170547200,,819,4.942028985507246
2305818,5,B0009NZ2KG,"I decided to write a review on this after reading many other's reviews.

First, there is a serious drama here about a father (the Preacher) and his daughter (Opal) grappling with the abandonment by their wife/mother seven years earlier.  Both characters resolve their feelings (of loss) throughout the movie, but especially during the search for Winn-Dixie towards the end of the movie.  This is an adult story, but one that doesn't interfere with the kid part of the movie.  I won't give it away here, but the resolution of the feelings of loss is very satisfying.

Second, there is a kid story in the movie.  This part is basically how a 10-year-old girl (Opal) makes friends after moving to a new town.  Opal learns that her original impressions of some of the kids need to be revised as she learns more about them, usually in positive ways.  Opal also learns she can soften people as they get to know her (adults), and I think both types of adapting are very positively portrayed.

These two plot lines are facilitated heavily by Opal's voice over narration and point of view.

Finally, the movie has a great score and is full of sappy sentimentality as well as a heavy doses of clichs.  But they all work, and I expect the vast majority of viewers will easily allow themselves the luxury of this overt manipulation by all those people associated with the creation of this film.",1169942400,2,1382,4.669421487603306

2305824,4,B0009NZ2KG,"Based upon the children's book of the same name by Kate DiCamillo, BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE is the story that revolves around a young girl named Opal (AnnaSophia Robb).  Opal's mother ran off when she was young, leaving her to be raised by her father (Jeff Daniels) who happens to be a preacher--which is also what Opal calls him.  The father and daughter move to a new town in the South U.S. where Preacher has a new congregation that meets in an old store.  Opal is lonely.  She loves her father, but as a preacher he has an entire congregation that he is responsible for, too.  Opal longs for a friend and while in the local Winn-Dixie supermarket one day, she meets a stray dog there that is causing trouble.  The dog obeys Opal's voice and soon becomes her constant companion.  With Winn-Dixie as her guide and companion, Opal sets off on some very interesting adventures, rekindles her relationship with her dad, and befriends a wide variety of people, from an elderly librarian to a shady pet store worker.  Through all of her encounters Opal learns that love is a powerful force, sometimes so powerful that the only way we can grow is to let go of the things we love most.

BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE offers some fine performances.  AnnaSophia Robb captures the youthful innocence, wandering spirit, and awkward emotional growth of Opal perfectly.  Jeff Daniels is directly on as Preacher.  Dave Matthews makes a startling good debut performance as pet store worker, Otis, and I have to say it was nice to see Matthew on a more human playing-field than the divine-like status his cult of followers have placed him upon.  Cicely Tyson and Eva Marie Saint also have roles and round out part of Opal's closest inner circle.

BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE is a good family film.  The film is full of quirky characters, but they are characters that every child could meet if they lived in a safe place that was open to letting children be themselves instead of pretending they were adults.  The film has some good messages and despite that sadness that tinges its corners, it fills the viewer with hope and not despair.",1158192000,7,2106,4.697547683923705

While on the surface, Because of Winn Dixie is the story of a girl and a dog, it is much deeper than that. Because of Winn Dixie is a story of how each of us make mistakes, and how each of us are lonely, and how one small event can change the lives of many.

I found myself near tears many times in the film. I also burst out laughing many, many times. Like life, Because of Winn Dixie will have you laughing and crying at the same time. And in the end, you will feel uplifted, with hope, and a better person for seeing the film.

I can't praise this film enough. Everything is perfect. The film is not just a family movie, but a great story for all ages. Whether you are 7, or 77, you will want to watch it again.

The cast was perfect, and every actor did an amazing job. There wasn't a stray line or moment in the film. Because of Winn Dixie leaves you totally engrossed in the film, and totally immersed in the emotions of the story.

2305849,4,B0009NZ2KG,"Because of Winn Dixie (Wayne Wang, 2004)

Because of Winn-Dixie was one of the truly pleasant surprises in my reading last year, a wonderful little book that didn't talk down to its audience and told its story simply and without sappiness. Wayne Wang (Smoke) was seemingly an odd choice to put behind the camera for a screen adaptation, but it worked.

India Opal (newcomer Annasophia Robb) and her father, whom we know as The Preacher (Jeff Daniels), have just moved into a new town. India Opal can't find anyone to be friends with, until on a routine trip to the grocery store, she meets an adorable stray dog she names Winn-Dixie. Winn-Dixie is quite a bit better at making friends than India Opal is, and the two of them then go around doing so. It doesn't sound all that interesting, but it is.

Wang and screenwriter Joan Singleton keep the light sheen of magical realism overlying the story intact without overplaying it, and the movie is awash in good performances. Both Robb and Daniels work well in their roles, and the rest of the minor characters are well-cast.

A fine adaptation of a wonderful book, well worth your time. If you avoided it because it's a kids' flick, reconsider; there's much to be liked here for adults as well. ****",1151452800,3,1248,4.659090909090909

2305852,2,B0009NZ2KG,"The first half of this movie (45 - 55 minutes) is a Disneyesque slapstick spills-and-mishaps bash.  The dog trashes the supermarket, then the dog trashes the house-trailer where the girl and her father live, then the dog trashes the pet store, then the dog trashes the house-trailer a second time (in case you weren't watching the first time).  And these five-minute trash-bashes are separated by one mishap or spill after another.  It's enough to make David Swift himself jealous.  If you like seeing the same scene repeated four times, then this movie is for you.  To this half of the movie I give zero stars.

The second half is much better: three stars.  I'd give it four but the developments that happen--the gradual making of friends and the rejuvenation of the town--are sketchily motivated if at all.  If the screenwriter had taken the time wasted in the first half and devoted it to a convincing development of the friendships, etc., this would have been a good movie.  As it is, there are some nice moments in the second half of the movie.

I'd recommend starting at track 13 (to skip all the spills and slapstick) and watching from there on.  Even so, given the poor development, I'm not sure this movie will stand up to a second viewing, so rent before you buy.

2305854,4,B0009NZ2KG,"BEACUSE OF WINN-DIXIE succeeds as a credible view of the world through children's eyes because it remains honest and straightforward.  Credit director Wayne Wang and Joan Singleton's screenplay adaptation of Kate DiCamillo's fine novel for keeping this story simple, direct, terse, and most important, not allowing it to fold into a saccharine tearjerker.  As it stands it is quiet, true, and a worthwhile statement about how children view adults and their progress toward becoming one.

Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) was deserted by her mother at age three and comes to live in a small Florida town with her brittle preacher father (Jeff Daniels).  She finds it difficult to adjust to the odd folk of the village until she adopts a terrific dog Winn-Dixie. Life blossoms for her until her dog is lost during a storm and she faces tragedy in her life once again. But this potential tragedy opens the door for her to relate to her father (and vice versa) and appreciate the disparate people who have befriended her.

The film is shot in a very small scale in keeping with the story. There are no pretensions here: the people Opal meets include such fine character actors as Cicely Tyson, Eva Marie Saint, Dave Matthews and the remainder of the cast is to be respected for the understated manner in which they draw their characters.  Jeff Daniels (The Hours, The Squid and the Whale, Goodnight and Good Luck, The Goodbye Girl, Gods and Generals, etc) continues to prove that he is one of our finer actors on the screen and stage:  when an actor of his stature takes on a film like this, one is almost guaranteed it is a worthwhile film to see.  Not a great movie, but a very good one that provides a healthy breath of fresh air to the current choices of downer movies. Grady Harp, March 06",1143763200,8,1780,4.6826923076923075

2305878,2,B0009NZ2KG,"Despite an earnest cast and some striking photography, this film somehow misses the mark, though from the previous reviews, it appears to have pleased many people. The book is a mystical and ""new-agey"" type of story in the ""Legend of Bagger Vance"" vein, and the themes in it are intriguing. But somehow these qualities are lost in the translation to this easygoing, unchallenging movie adaptation. Kids may find it amusing, but the more esoteric concepts are poorly handled, (specifically the power of the Litmus Lozenges) and the secondary characters tend to be distractions: the labored comedy of a deputy sherrif made us wince when we saw the film. That the story goes on for too long may have been forgivable, had there been more momentum, suspense, or intrigue, but ""Dixie's"" ambling pacing works against it. The young star is appealing, and quite pretty, but unremarkable as a performer, and she's let down by a director who misunderstands the material. To those looking for a truly involving family film, I might suggest Alfonzo Cuaron's ""A Little Princess"" (1995) to see how such things could be done. ""Winn Dixie"" is certainly pleasant enough, as these things go, but perhaps such films should aspire to be more than pleasant, if they're to resonate with their audience.",1138838400,3,1279,5.009389671361502

2305880,1,B0009NZ2KG,"In the best books and movies for kids, the author or filmmaker manages to transcend his or her adult perspective and show the world through a child's eyes. Most books and films do the opposite: they use a child as a mouthpiece to express the author's pieties about the world. That's what happens here, where 10-year-old India Opal Baloney (a superbly trite name, that) discovers such gems as ""everyone's gotta find his own way through life,"" and ""you have to keep the ghosts of the bad things you've done at bay,"" and ""we're all basically swell deep down and should just get together and sing songs--kumbaya, preferably--and eat egg salad sandwiches."" And don't drink (liquor) because that's what made momma hit the road, that and Dad's utter fecklessness.

Excellent cast of stock characters in this one, too (if you're still reading). Jeff Daniels plays the spine-of-jellyfish store-front preacher--a well-deserved fate given his apparent lack of ability. Cicely Tyson plays a younger version of her Miss Jane Pittman character, the Noble Black Woman Who Has Seen It All--er, until she went blind (making her even more noble). Dave Matthews plays the quiet musician (hey, just like in real life!) just out of prison for breaking his guitar over the head of a policeman. Hey, it was all just a misunderstanding because, see above, there are no bad people...now all join hands for kumbaya. Anyway, he loves animals and brings a big jar of pickles to a party, so he must be cool. The girl (India) is played as a cross between a saint and a sage...she grows tedious.

Oh yeah, the dog, Windex (what my daughter thought he was called). He has a great scene where he burps, loudly, like a human. I laughed at that. (My wife chimes in: ""The dog was adorable!"")

Virtually every Amazon reviewer seems to love this movie because it's a ""family"" movie--virtually no cussing and no sex. Fine; I'm all for that too. But movies without those things don't automatically become good--you need decent writing and acting, too. Contrast this 100 minutes of we-are-the-world sentiment with, say, Anne of Green Gables (book and TV series) or the novels of Christopher Paul Curtis (Bud, Not Buddy; The Watsons Go to Birmingham), where the authors actually get inside their young characters' heads and present a real world of humor, conflict, and perseverance.

2305882,4,B0009NZ2KG,"Last night I happened to be watching an episode of ""Ghost Whisperer"" in which a father and son have become estranged after the death of the woman who was their wife and mother.  From beyond the grave she is trying to bring them back together and there is a point at which the father finally reveals the depths of his loss and tells his son, ""She was your mother, but she was my wife.""  Today I watched ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" and waited for the moment for the father in this film to say essentially the same thing to his daughter, recognizing that it would not be until the end of the film and once the catalyst of the title character, an abandoned mutt adopted by the daughter, has worked his magic.

The daughter is 10-year-old Opal (AnnaSophia Robb, and not, as my wife assumed, Dakota Fanning), who lives with her father, Preacher (Jeff Daniels) in a trailer.  That name is his vocation, and his new church is being run out of a convenience store.  In time we find out that Opal's mother has run away and her father does not want to talk about it, even though every time she asks if her mother left anything behind when she left he fails to provide the obvious answer until the end of the movie.  He also does not want Opal to keep the dog she has found, a mutt representing some hitherto unknown breed of canine.  They are not allowed to have pets in the trailer, but despite his general insensitivity towards the life his daughter is leading when she points out that the dog is her only friend in the world, he relents and allows the first crack in their frozen relationship to be made.

This 2005 film is really a children's movie, not just because the main character is a child but also because you need the innocence of that perspective not to be disgusted by her father.  The fact that he is a preacher, and therefore accustomed to ministering to members of a congregation who are experiencing the loss of a loved one, only heightens his failure to respond to the emotional pain of his daughter.  I realize that the basic dynamic here of the parent and child separated by the loss of a common loved one who find each other again is an old one (it is the basis of ""The Secret Garden"" even though the parent and child are not related and they have lost different loved ones), but for many children this will only be like the tenth time they have seen such a story.

Both the kid and the dog are both cute and competent, and if you want to be an adult and look start calculating how much property damage Winn-Dixie is causing in this film then do not be surprised that you are not enjoying it as much as the little ones.  While we wait for Winn-Dixie to bring Opal and Preacher back together, you have the likes of Cecily Tyson, Eva Marie Saint, and Dave Matthews running around as loveable eccentrics who become part of the extended family that the little girl and the great big dog are creating together.  ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is directed by Wayne Wang, who last did ""Maid in Manhattan"" but should be better known for ""The Joy Luck Club,"" and is based on Kate DiCamillo's novel.  Despite its basic predictability, it is an enjoyable enough film that should delight children and those who are still capable of taking that perspective.",1134172800,,3245,4.441077441077441

2305942,4,B0009NZ2KG,"It should be no secret by now that ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is a children's film, its target audience of pre-teens  are meant to be entranced by the title character and the many cute animals even if they have not read the book from which the film was adapted.  This moderate budget ($20 Million) film made a lot of money by carefully targeting this audience with a fairy tale story where there are no really ""bad"" people.

Being a children's film is not a fault or at least should not be a fault.  But teenagers and adults should understand going in that ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is not on the ""family film"" level of ""Monkey Trouble"" or ""My Dog Skip"".  There is less here for older viewers unless they are willing to let themselves view the film from a child's eyes.

That said there are some elements for more sophisticated viewers if they just look hard enough.

Director Wayne Wang engages in a fair amount of self-parody.  Although 10 year old Opal (the main human character) is played realistically, Dakota Fanning's little sister Elle's character is (intentionally) one of the most sugary in film history, appropriately named Sweetie Pie Thomas.  John McConnell and Harland Williams play the crybaby grocery store manager and the goofy sheriff with a kind of homage to Barney Fife and Roscoe P. Coltraine.

Jeff Daniels gives an excellent performance as Opal's somewhat distanced father.  Daniels plays the character with a nice balance.  The father-daughter scenes are very believable and by far the best part of the film.  There were many ways that these scenes could have gone wrong but Daniels manages to dodge the traps and give us a conflicted character with whom to connect.

Dave Matthews, Cecily Tyson, and Eva Marie Saint are interesting in supporting roles.

Finally there is AnnaSophia Robb (Opal), who like Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" provides voiceover narration to help flesh out the storyline.  Unlike Sweetie Pie, Robb underplays her character nicely, and is ""pleasingly cute"" as a Tomboy with great big eyes and a young Jodie Foster/Lindsey Lohen style.  This was her first feature but she quickly followed it up with a role in the new ""Willy Wonka"" movie, the two roles are polar opposites so it appears that Robb has a decent about of versatility.  She should have quite a future as an actress.

Guess which store? (That's how he got his name-o)

The actors - including Winn Dixie - in the movie are good and well-cast, but it would have taken a movie much longer than the average child can/will sit in the average theatre seat without popcorn and potty breaks to tell the total tail of Winn Dixie and friends.

She was a perfect choice to play the blind women who teaches India Opal what it means to truly 'see.'  I pictured Gloria very differently and was pleasantly surprised by the uncharacteristically scruffy Tyson.  Jeff Daniels and Dave Matthews are men who have been hurt but still manage to take the risks needed to keep love flowing to them and from them.
