7879194,5,6304794363,I show this movie in school because it is both entertaining and has some good lessons about bullying.  Too many of the kids shows today are fluffy and portray adults as idiots or incompetents.  This movie deals with many relevant issues in ways that lead to good discussions.  I fully recommend this movie to preteens and early teens.,1402012800,,334,4.724137931034483
7879195,4,6304794363,This is a wonderful family movie that has a great story line for all ages. We were thrilled to be able to find this movie after looking for it for sometime. I wish they would remake it in a DVD format. Our only issue with the film is that there are a few places where the movie goes blank...I'm thinking that is because the VHS tape is so old. Even with the skipped areas which are brief we are so thankful to have the movie that we are willing to overlook the flaws. The movie itself we rate as a 5 star. The quality of the tape led me to give it a 4 star rating.,1358208000,,564,3.8706896551724137
7879196,5,6304794363,i did some checking on the web for the movie what it was about and the rating on the movie for family viewing before i purchasing it and it was everything they said it was very good and also good for any family unit to view and the movie arrived safely and the tape was very good for viewing as well thank you all virginia,1316822400,,322,3.9692307692307693
7879197,5,6304794363,"OK..here I go again.  As a devoted fan of Katharine Isabelle, I had to purchase this film; I was not disappointed at all!  For fans of Katie, this family movie is enriched by Katharine's ability to give a raw, honest performance (even when she was at this young age!).  I'll also give credit where credit is due - all of the actors in this film performed excellently!  Very truthful performances bringing a story centered on following ones dreams - despite the negative feedback from naysayers.  Timothy Dalton plays the father of the determined Jo, who wants to build a raft to float a female moose to an island to mate with a male moose.  Great movie for family and fans of Katharine Isabelle as well - you'll be surprised what this lady could do even as a very young actress!",1264464000,,778,4.521428571428571
7879198,5,6304794363,"Typical of Hallmark, this story was warm and vibrant, and leaves you with that 'feel-good' contentment.  Filmed in Nova Scotia, the story revolves around growing up, friendship, respecting parents, and overall, abiding by the Golden Rule.  The moose training for this movie was great, they appear as sweet, and gentle mammals of the woods.  Would recommend for everyone to see, at least once.",1233273600,,392,5.190476190476191
7879199,3,6304794363,"I'm screening movies that a friend gave me to see what might be suitable to show my students. I looked up this movie online, saw that it was Hallmark, and rated G, and thought, Great, good start, so I threw it in the VCR and started it up. To my dismay (not a deal-breaker, but it bugs me) in the first 5 minutes of the movie, the dad tells the boy he played a ""hell of a game"". That's just not necessary, and I teach international students, so I hate being put in the position of having to explain anything that I wouldn't say myself and that we don't want to hear them saying either. Why do producers feel it's ok to slip in stuff like this and still give it a G rating?",1177372800,,672,4.022388059701493
