6473689,4,B00L7T54X6,"Warrior Princess was another film that tracks the lives of a particular Mongol tribe during the 1500's.

In the movie, The Mongols, aren't at the peak of their power anymore. In fact, the Chinese seem to have the upper hand as they sit back and let the Mongols quarrel with one another. But basically the film follows the life of Anoh and her husband as they struggle to keep power in the Western region of Mongolia. We go through several decades of their lives which eventually leads to a huge battle between Anoh's group and the central Mongols, who have temporarily allied with the Chinese. The film takes us through several scenes of intrigue and drama before it reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well I have to say there were things I liked and disliked about this movie. My main complaint is that it's another Mongolian story that tracks the life of a few particular characters. While that's interesting in the sense that you get a slight history lesson, it also means we're constantly jumping ahead in time. I prefer films that stay focused on key incidents rather than tracking a character's life. But that's the extent of my complaint.

As for the rest of the film, it had some redeeming qualities. For example, we get to see a lot of open country with vast hills that stretch our imaginations. We also get to see the colorful costuming that 1500's Mongols wore. Blue being one of the brightest colors. We also get a taste of  how power struggles played out in Mongolian history.

As for the battle itself, it was fair, but not epic. The Mongols showed some of their signature tactics like riding horseback while firing arrows at their enemies. They also employed the lasso on their foes at times. But the battle sequences weren't over the top. They were a bit muddled, especially when the director decided to employ the slow moe option. It almost felt like we were watching a made for TV Chinese drama, when it came to the battles, only at a slightly higher level. Also, the title in English is a little misleading. This film is not about a Warrior Princess. However, Anoh does fight in the final battle with her husband.

The film is presented in Mongolian. It also includes an English dub. English and Spanish subtitles are also available.

Overall I'm giving the film a four. It does a decent job of giving us a taste of Mongolian life during the 1500's. It also gives us the other side of the story between the Mongols and the Chinese. The landscapes and costumes give us enough eye candy to keep us interested. The battles could have been better, but they get the message across. A decent viewing if you're interested in a Mongolian story filled with lots of  intrigue and history. But not a whole lot of fighting.",1415491200,3,2744,4.597137014314929
6473690,5,B00L7T54X6,"This movie was great! It was not a smooth ""high tech"" production, the warriors on pony back were not computer generated they were men and women in period dress, using period Mongol tactics and shooting arrows from the saddle at a gallop!  That skill does not come overnight. The acting may not seem skillful to Hollywood eyes because real life is not written, posed and lighted for effect, but simple with few words as life often is. It was amazing to get a glimpse of the past portrayed by people descended from the people portrayed! This is not a polished film with all the latest prefabricated bells and whistles but a moment of sight to a time few really know about.",1413244800,6,670,4.537190082644628
6473691,1,B00L7T54X6,"The special effects are very bad. For example, when a fighter thrusts his weapon into his opponent's body, only their faces are shown! I can't see the sword go through a human body.

The acting is below average. The whole movie looks and feel like a bad TV show.",1412726400,,262,4.346938775510204

8664210,3,B00L7T54X6,"This movie tries to take an epic story that faded into obscurity back to life. I did some research on the web about the background of this story. For such an epic, it feels like the plot is lacking a bit. It touched on a lot of historical elements but they are not well developed or connected.
For the war that determined the fate of a people, the war scenes aren't as grandiose as I expected. I was thinking the war scenes should be at a scale comparable to Napoleonic wars.
I'm not sure whether the Dzungar costumes are authentic to the 17th century, they seem to be, but the Qing costumes and depictions are crude. Nevertheless this movie offers a rare point of view from the mongols on these historical events.
If you love mongol themed movies based on history, i'd recommend a 2008 movie called Mongol The Rise of Genghis Khan.",1468454400,,832,4.444444444444445

8664216,2,B00L7T54X6,"I have really enjoyed several other Mongolian films, such as Cave of the Yellow Dog or Weeping Camel. I was excited to see this story being told in film. However, the story skipped key plot points that led to the film being confusing and disjointed. Worse is that even with the skipping around, the movie felt slow.

  I recommend someone else make a movie covering the same topic, and we all watch that.",1426464000,,404,4.506849315068493
