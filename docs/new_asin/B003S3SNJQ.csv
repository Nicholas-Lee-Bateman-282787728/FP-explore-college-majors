8403984,5,B003S3SNJQ,"I have practiced yoga for 30 years and am now 70.  In those 30 years I have praciced almost every form of  hatha yoga. I find this DVD  to be accessible to all levels of students and it includes many poses that are unique and beneficial.  It is unique in that it includes poses that I have never experienced before and they are beneficial in that they target particular parts of the body that are often weak and vulnerable to injury.  I love the pace and program of this DVD and plan to use it at least 2 times a week to compliment the other prgrams that I use that are more traditional in their content.

David Moreno's Lateral Sequence deserves a place in every committed yoga student's personal yoga library.  I wish he would do more!",1439942400,,737,4.335766423357664
8403985,5,B003S3SNJQ,"As someone who has practiced yoga devotedly for over 15 years, I have never found a DVD that offers authentic yoga - yoga which addresses all the originally intended aspects of the practice from the physiological experience of my muscles to the profound effects on the subtle body. David Moreno's DVD is like finding a pot of gold - this is clearly a thoughtful practice born of someone with many many years of experience and knowledge. If you were to do only one yoga practice, this could be it. This flow, if you let go into it, is a complete sequence and produces amazing results. You get to get your bliss on while enjoying the many other benefits to your physical and emotional body.  If you are a beginner - lucky you for finding it. If you are a seasoned practitioner - this is what you've been looking for all these years.",1296604800,5,830,4.4605263157894735
8403986,1,B003S3SNJQ,"If you love the ""effort"" in yoga then this is not for you. Its slow and super easy. Its good if all you want is a relaxing stretch. If you are a hard core power yoga person then do not get this dvd",1294185600,,197,3.604651162790698
8403987,5,B003S3SNJQ,"For those of us who have practiced with David in person but do not live in the Bay area, this is a long overdue means of continuing with his unique style. For those who have not had the pleasure, you now can experience one of the most creative yoga teachers. As a middle aged man who has practiced yoga for almost 20 years, I find his yin element of deep flow yoga so much more satisfying than the uber-yang of ashtanga and power flow. The timber, pace and other qualities of David's voice encourage one to organically grow into the pose rather than become a static statue. The quality of the production, especially David's voice-over instructions and the visual alternation between David's practice and that of his students, facilitates viewing and practicing. The explicit instructions about the short form and poses not to be attempted by the unfamiliar is an asset for the neophyte. I recommend this DVD for both yogis/yoginis with established practices and the yoga-curious.",1290643200,5,979,4.868263473053892
8403988,5,B003S3SNJQ,"Great Yoga Videos!  FINALLY, I'm staying with my home practice thanks to  David Moreno's fabulous videos! These are simply the best instructional yoga videos I've ever used!!",1286755200,2,174,5.407407407407407
8403989,5,B003S3SNJQ,"I recently recovered from surgery, and turned to this video for one of my first sessions.  It felt great to stretch again, and I was able to modify the poses according to my ability.  What a wonderful way to renew and restore my yoga practice!",1286755200,,243,4.377777777777778
8403990,5,B003S3SNJQ,"It is difficult for me to fully express how wonderful this CD has proven to be for me.  I am one of those people that doesn't really do things unless I'm pushed to.  For a while it was easy as I had settled into a life of domesticity and attending my yoga classes regularly.  When I realized I wanted and needed to go back to work, my first thought was: ""There goes my practice""  Fortunately, there were David's videos, which have pushed , coaxed and elicited the practice out of me on the road.  His easy to listen voice, his precise instruction  and his gentle prodding to get the most I can give out of me every time, without making me feel threatened or competitive has made me keep up the practice on the road.
For a sixty year old woman who decided to go back to work travelling 3 days out of the week with really long hours and sometimes for weeks on end...David Moreno has been my home companion, he brings me back there.  I write this far away from home and just finishing my time with him.",1286496000,3,999,4.226315789473684
8403991,5,B003S3SNJQ,This is such a wonderful DVD! The verbal instruction and visual images of the students are equally informative. Very relaxing yet challenging. Davids' elegant and insightful guidance should certainly benefit your practice bringing clarity and a new view. A MUST buy! Om Shanti,1286496000,,276,5.441860465116279
8403992,5,B003S3SNJQ,"Easy to follow and aimed at beginners through to advanced yoga practitioners, David Moreno infuses this teaching with his unique artist vision. Soft, unobtrusive music and careful use of soothing colour help to still the mind.

Having tried out this sequence several times now, I'm relaxing into the 'flow' - and deeply appreciating David's master class.",1284940800,,354,5.321428571428571
