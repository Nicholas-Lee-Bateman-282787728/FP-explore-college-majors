3859678,1,B00275EGY2,"I don't think the other reviewers listed here saw the same movie as I did.  ""Cheri"" is boring, boring, boring!

As a period piece, it is much more like the cheesy, soft-core productions that came from photographer David Hamilton than quality stuff like Merchant and Ivory.

The plot and the performances practically define the word ""ENNUI"".  In the early scenes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Friend do such a good job parroting the same accent, that the scenes between them nearly sound like monologues.

It doesn't matter to me that the source material was Colette, by the middle of the movie I was asleep.  I kept expecting Mel Brooks to charge onto the screen behind Michelle Pfeiffer, bellowing ""CAN'T YOU SEE SHE'S POOPED?!!""

Unless you are in need of a sedative, avoid this movie like the plague.",1256860800,5,803,4.860294117647059
3859679,4,B00275EGY2,"This movie is about a certain social milieu of the Golden Age of Paris (the early 1900s).  It is the Americanization of Colette but it works for a more mainstreamed audience.  A more serious adaptation would be NC-17, at least, and the subject matter in this movie never becomes that risqu.

We meet a great beauty nearing the end of her career as a courtesan in Paris.  We meet a lot of other aging courtesans as well, one of them the unscrupulous mother of a handsome young man nicknamed Cheri.  Everyone knows they are having an affair but it is only too late that the main characters realize that they also fell in love.  This story has been told several times and this rendition is very good.  I felt the pain of the aging beauty having to let go a much younger love.  I felt the aimlessness of Cheri as he leads a pampered life that cannot fulfill him.  Yes, it's a classic tragic tale but is it worth watching?  If you are a fan of star-crossed lovers or period pieces - absolutely!",1256688000,5,989,4.355191256830601
3859680,4,B00275EGY2,"Stephen Frears has created some powerful and very well crafted movies: 'Dangerous Liaisons', 'My Beautiful Laundrette', 'The Grifters', 'The Queen', 'Prick up your Ears', 'Dirty Pretty Things', etc.  One would expect that his experience in dealing with edgy issues would make him the perfect choice for adapting the famous French writer of 'naughty novels' - Colette - but somewhere in the flow of this production, perhaps in the Christopher Hampton's adaptation of the novel to screenplay, the original stories become perfumed and sanitized. And the reasons why this happened remain obscure.

The story is simple: courtesans in Paris must eventually retire form their lives of becoming wealthy through pleasing men of the higher class, and either they live out their lives in the luxuries of fluff or they must confront their aging and feel pangs of remorse as they end their lives alone, without a man to bolster them. Lea de Lonval (Michelle Pfeiffer) has been longtime 'friends' with Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates), even to the point of nurturing Madame's son Ch&eacute;ri (Rupert Friend) as he approaches manhood.  Madame asks Lea to 'polish' Ch&eacute;ri for other women and after what might have been a brief fling in Normandy, the young Ch&eacute;ri and the aging Lea fall into a six year  relationship.  But as Madame realizes she needs grandchildren, she eventually finds a proper girl Edmee (Felicity Jones) for Ch&eacute;ri to marry.  The remainder of the story is how these two age-disparate characters adapt to the 'social rules' of La Belle Epoque, suggesting that even under extraordinary circumstances the power of love is an issue that must be confronted.

Despite the performances by Pfeiffer and Friend (and even the miscast Bates) the story feels somehow sterile.  Perhaps it is the out of place use of a male narrator who gives the film an unnecessary feeling of being a documentary, or the somewhat overused musical score of Alexandre Desplat, or the emphasis on costumes that hardly add to the beauty of Pfeiffer as Lea that keep the production grounded.  It is a pleasant enough film, but hardly a memorable one.  Grady Harp, October 09",1256428800,3,2158,5.105113636363637
3859681,3,B00275EGY2,"In 2009, a French/British and German drama film titled ""Ch&eacute;ri"" was screened at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival.  The film is an adaptation of the novel from 1920 written by the French Novelist Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette or better known as Colette who is best known for her novel ""Gigi"" (which went on to inspire a film and musical).

The film is directed by Stephen Frears (""The Queen"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""High Fidelity"") and features a screenplay written by Christopher Hampton (""Atonement"", ""Total Eclipse"" and ""Dangerous Liaisons"").  Joining Frears is cinematographer Darius Kohndji (""My Blueberry Nights"", ""The Ruins"", ""The Interpreter"") and composer Alexandre Desplat (""Julie & Julia"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""The Golden Compass"", ""Syriana"").

The film takes place in Paris during the 1900s, at time when courtesans (prostitutes for the wealthy and powerful) were known for their celebrity like status and even setting the status quo of fashion during that era.  For Cheri (played by Rupert Friend, ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"", ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""The Last Legion""), he is an a 19-year-old man that has been spoiled by his mother former courtesan Madame Peloux (played by Kathy Bates, ""Misery"",""Titanic"", ""Fried Green Tomatoes"").  He has gotten everything he wanted but has not been satisfied with the many women that he has been with.

That is until he goes off with Lea (played by Michelle Pfeiffer, ""Stardust"", ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"", ""Dangerous Liaisons""), a courtesan that has been around when Cheri was a young boy.  Because Cheri has always listened to ""Nunu"" (his nickname for ""Lea""), Madame Peloux asks her arch-rival Lea to take Cheri out on her vacation and teach him some things about real women.

Needless to say, the two go of on vacation and have a sexual relationship in which the young 19-year-old starts to have a wonderful time with an older woman and for Lea, she gets a taste of youth.  A young man who doesn't want to grow up and an older woman who knows that she can't stay young forever. Both keep their fling in private for six years but despite their sexual liaison, life starts to change for both Lea and Cheri when Madame Peloux wants  grandchildren and thus her son Cheri is arranged to get married with a younger woman named Edmee (played by Felicity Jones, ""The Worst Witch"", ""Diary of Anne Frank"") from a rich family.

And its when they spend their life away from each other, it is then that they learn for themselves that they truly love each other but due to circumstances (primarily their age) they can never truly be together...or can they?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Ch&eacute;ri""is presented in widescreen (2:35:1) and is enhanced for 169 television.  For the most part, capturing the look of an era through the hairstyles, costumes, the set design and the vehicles are done rather nicely.  Outdoor scenes are beautiful and vibrant but the beauty of the film revolves around the look and feel of the film.

As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  For the most part, the film is dialogue and music driven, so mostly front and center channel usage throughout the film.  If there were surround sound usage, possibly during the train whistling but for a film like this, audio is satisfactory and dialogue is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Ch&eacute;ri"" comes with the following special features:

  * The Making of Ch&eacute;ri - (8:50) The making of ""Ch&eacute;ri"" and an interview with the director, crew and the talent about the film, Colette and the set and costume design.
  * Deleted Scenes - Two deleted scenes titled ""Turpentine"" (:21) and ""Never"" (1:49).

JUDGMENT CALL:

For the most part, ""Ch&eacute;ri"" is a film that I felt was average at best.  I can easily compliment the look of the film through its wonderful costume and set design.  I can also compliment how Michelle Pfeiffer looks absolutely incredible now as she was when she first appeared in film but part of the problem that I have with the film is that we know the film takes place in Paris.  You have Rupert Friend who fits the part with his accent but then we have Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea and Kathy Bates as Madame Peloux.  Both are fine actresses but for this film, I just have this nagging feeling that they were miscast.

I suppose that if you have one main actor with his European accent (and other talents in the film with their accents), you would expect the same with the film's two major talents.  Sure, Kathy Bates talks with a slight accent and Pfeiffer with none but with the film capturing that look and feel of early Paris, you would think that casting could have done the same.  Again, as talented as both women are, personally I felt the casting was off for both characters.  But despite that little quip that I have towards the film, I have to give Michelle Pfeiffer her due in showing a woman who has managed to become a successful business woman but deep inside you sense that loneliness which Pfeiffer manages to portray quite well with her facial expressions.

The other thing that I have the problem with the film is that it captures part of the Colette's novel.  There is one primary section that deals with war and another section that deals with Cheri revisiting Lea that is not shown in the film.  It would have been interesting to capture that moment from the novel but alas, the film's goal was to focus on two people in love, but due to their age...one born many years early and one too young to learn that what he had was the best thing he would ever have.

There are no surprises, to me there was no uplifting climax.  The film is straightforward and for the most part, just average.",1255996800,5,5781,4.815602836879433
3859682,3,B00275EGY2,"After all the critical acclaim this movie received i was looking forward to see this movie.
The story was quite good,the acting too,the music was particularly nice also.
Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful but unfortunately i thought that she looked painfully thin and the dresses she wore seemed to just hang on her ,women in that era were quite plump and i just did not see her as a believable courtisane.
Cathy Bates was miscast in this role i feel. She was badly overacting and i think they should have used an english actress to play the part, maybe Emma Thomson or Miranda Richardson.
Rupert Friend was good and believable in the part and i see a great future for him at the movies.
Don't get me wrong it wasn't unpleasant  but but it could have been so much better.",1253836800,21,767,4.517985611510792
3859683,5,B00275EGY2,"A rapture of visual, audio and cinematic emotional brilliance all tied with a killer last line.  What a wonder is set before the viewer when one enters the world of ""Cheri"".
  The visual richness of this parfait of the Belle Epoch is breathtaking from the rich creamy art neuveau architecture to the gloriously realized costumes of the early 20th century. What they only indicated in ""Titanic"" of the same period costumes. Explodes in luxury and in a sense informs the eye to the scene at hand and seems less costume than authentic clothing.
  As Cinema ""Cheri"" succeeds as more than an adaptation of a Collette novel but becomes a world unto it's own. Here we are presented with some of our finest female performers at the top of their game. In short I am speaking of Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathy Bates.  As former courtesan rivals who are now aging friends they come together to define the last part of their lives and the beginning of Bates' son's life in a remarkable way.
  Kathy Bates goes deep into the complexities of her mix of comedy and nuanced drama in the same way she did with Annie Wilkes. Not to say that the characters of Annie and Madame Peloux are anything alike. But Miss Bates takes this role to a superior level while all the while not letting you see her do her magic. She is just THERE! The scene where her face decays from a radioactively sunny  laugh to reveal her true deepest disgust her spoiled soul is priceless.
  Then there is Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea de Lonval, at fifty one she may be older that the literary Lea but she has never been more luminous or nearly goddess like. To look at her is to look upon a woman of a certain age that is ageless in her embrace of times changing hands upon her face. But there is more. This may be the pinnacle of her career, the role of her lifetime. She is Lea in so many levels both within her acting and in a sense as an actress. She is stunning and brings forth the soul of a great character as only our finest actors can.
  But all of this would seem a delightful trifle, a light story of an aging courtesan and her young lover if it were not for the narration that gives the film added depth and gravitas. I asked a friend today what he thought of the final outcome of the story. Of what the narrator reveals of what became of Cheri.  He tossed it off lightly and said that it seemed an after thought. He could not have been more wrong. He missed the whole point of the film.  The last lines of the film that tell us of the ultimate fate of Lea and Cheri are what give this film an emotional strength, irony, and ultimately heart wrenching tragedy. It is the final twist set into a stunning jewel of a film that is as captivating and spellbinding as Lea's mysterious emerald ring.",1246924800,17,2753,4.349609375

The concept of an aging prostitute mothering and falling in love with a boy half her age is interesting.  However the actors are directed or compelled to overact in awful, fake accents which distracts from the drama.
Rupert Friend's portrayal of the totally spoiled,  childish boy ""Cheri"" is watchable and the only authentic performance. He is emotionally repugnant yet physically beautiful.

3859825,4,B00275EGY2,"Closely based on Colette's novel, ""Cheri"", this is a beautiful production starring Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea de Lonval, an aging courtesan who unexpectedly falls in love with the handsome but scapegrace son (Rupert Friend) of her long time associate, Mme. Peloux, wonderfully played by Kathy Bates.  The son, nicknamed ""Cheri"", is equally smitten with Lea; with her he finds not only passion, but comfort and friendship which have been lacking in his young life.  The two begin a lengthy relationship that ends only when it is decided that Cheri must settle down, manage his fortune and get married.  The movie explores not only the relationship between Lea and Cheri, but magnificently displays the lavish lifestyle of the now-aging Belle Epoque courtesans.  The settings and costumes are delicious and historically accurate.  The only fault to find is with the end, which attempts to rush through in a few sentences Colette's sequel, ""The Last of Cheri"".  It's a bit awkward, but the graceful and sensitive performances and lovely set and costume designs more than make up for this deficiency.",1427328000,4,1094,5.1525423728813555

They looked like faded pretenders rather than sought-after women of power and intrigue. They looked like caricatures.

The movie was interesting enough for me to read the book and watch it again. This time I saw the lovely costumes and settings, the rich detail and the love story itself.

3859906,4,B00275EGY2,"It's been a long time since I've read any of Collette's novels but I remember enough to know that this movie was not going to be a thigh-slapper.  The film captures the terribly bittersweet feeling of love found and lost that Collette seemed to know so well.  Here we have an aging but still beautiful courtesan who has made it this far in life without letting herself slip into the pitfall of actually falling in love.  She's about to retire and relishes being able to sleep alone in her lovely satin sheets.  Then...ooops, just when she's having an innocent fling she goes an actually does it.  This time it's with a young man who must be less than half her age.  The impossibility of their relationship makes their affair terribly poignant. You know that it can't go anywhere but you want it too, just as they do.

Michelle Pfeiffer looks very good as the courtesan but I had a hard time with her voice.  Her American accent kept coming through and her deliberately mannered way of speaking seemed terribly artificial.  Still she is a compelling actress and after a while her grenuine emotions seemed to overtake her initial speech clumsiness. Rupert Friend was perfectly cast as Cheri, the young fellow she falls for.  He is impossibly handsome and thoroughly convincing as the spoiled, arrogant but charming man-child.  As callow as he seems to be at first, his genuine feelings for her come through.  It's a fine performance and the two of them looked very good together.  They made the affair absolutely credible in spite of the age difference. Kathy Bates is good, too, in her role as the fellow's mother.

The costumes and sets are delicious and add a great deal to the enjoyment of the film.

This is a film about the times, la Belle Epoque, its pleasures and pains....very well told.  It's interesting, that the narrator tells us, at the end, how the First World War brought an end to that time and how Cheri eventually ended his life.",1344988800,8,1946,4.6627565982404695

3859908,5,B00275EGY2,"I should have bought this months ago when I had the chance, but hadn't seen it.  Well, I viewed it on Netflix last night and fell in love with it.  Having only begun to read some of Colette's work, this was what got me to play it, and it was delightful.

Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays an aging and still beautiful courtesan named Lea, is asked by a fellow prostitute's mother, Charlotte (played wonderfully by Cathy Bates), to teach her 19 year-old son Cheri (Rupert Friend) the ways of love in order to groom him to be suitable for marriage, and she acquiesces.  Unfortunately, the plan backfires when the unlikely couple fall in love with each other, and it causes a lifetime of heartache for the young man and the young wife he eventually takes.

I felt genuinely sorry for Lea, especially when she sat up in her bed crying out his name, but my feelings about Cheri were mixed.  He was often cruel to his bride after Lea implored him to be kind to her, and he often skulked about like a child even when he was 25.

Snotty back-handed compliments from the pretentious Charlotte are often sumultaneously humorous and infuriating; the story is both witty and and heartbreaking.  Gorgeous costumes, scenery, and the music are also splendid, adding oomph to a sometimes thin script, but that is such a minor aside.  If you like period films with an involving story, a decent cast, and plenty of beautiful eye candy, Cheri is a movie you'll want to see.  By the way, if you've never read any of Colette's works, the movie ends like The Last of Cheri.",1326412800,3,1546,4.548736462093863

3859926,3,B00275EGY2,"Since I've written a book myself about 19th century legalized prostitution in France and the way things were, an acquaintance recommended I watch this movie.  After all the research I've done on prostitution, mistresses, lorettes, and the like, it was interesting to see the life of an aging, though gorgeous, woman in that profession.

She falls in love with the son of another former courtesan, whose is as rich as her, from their years of sexual trysts with high society men and aristocrats.  Actually, it's quite true, that women of these types were quite wealthy in their own right, as their benefactors showered them with money and jewels to be their mistresses.  It was not uncommon for mistresses to accompany their benefactors, with their wives, even to public entertainment, such as the Opera, etc.  It was just the way things were.

But what happens to those women when they age?  Well, Cheri, is a good example of one woman clinging to her youth through a man old enough to be her own son.  She let's herself fall in love, when she really knows better, and so does he.  The outcome of their love is heartbreaking, and I can thoroughly understand desperately a woman who wants to keep their attractive youth and need to be desired.

As far as the movie itself and acting, I have to give it three stars. It was interesting to watch, but not at the top of my list of outstanding movies.",1286323200,4,1395,4.634146341463414

With ""Cheri"", Michelle Pfeiffer returns to the period drama genre that has served her so well in the past (""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""The Age of Innocence""). This time, rather than play the innocent or unattainable object of desire, Pfeiffer plays Lea, an aging, semi-retired courtesan having a May-December romance with the son of her friend.

Pfeiffer, one of my all-time favorite actresses, plays Lea as a woman who has spent her life choosing wealth, freedom, and privilege over genuine relationships. She's not cruel or heartless, but more of a composed, world-weary realist whose experience has taught her how to manipulate most situations to her advantage using charm and her still considerable beauty. Madame Peloux (the always formidable Kathy Bates), Lea's longtime friend and another retired courtesan, may not have maintained her stunning youthful beauty, but is perhaps more manipulative and shrewd than Lea. When Peloux's 19 year old son, Cheri, is becoming too troublesome, Peloux is shrewd enough to take advantage of the mutual attraction shared between Cheri and Lea, knowing that Lea will help refine the boy and teach him what he needs to know to become a good husband for the right girl. Lea and Cheri enter into a relationship meant to be casual, but end up living together happily for six years. Unfortunately, the two's unconventional relationship is threatened when Peloux decides that it's time for the boy to marry a young girl and give her grandchildren.

Rupert Friend seems to be getting mixed reviews for his performance, but I thought he did quite well. He plays Cheri with the appropriate mannerisms of a beautiful, fatherless, neglected young man who's spent his life surrounded by privilege and debauchery. And despite their age difference, Friend and Pfeiffer share enough chemistry and heat to make the film's central relationship believable.

The performances are all good, and the art direction is sumptuous, making the film very lovely to look at. The script and direction are just adequate, however, making this a decent film, but not a great one. As in all period pieces, the Mise-en-scne is of a different era, but the themes are timeless. The characters in ""Cheri"" struggle with familiar human things ... being true to themselves vs. fulfilling the expectations put upon them, the sacrifices made for wealth and luxury, and the fleetingness (and benefits) of youth and beauty.",1285718400,4,2425,5.162849872773537
3859928,4,B00275EGY2,"Maybe has-been harlots of the Belle Epoque affected, entre elles-memes, the wit of Wilde characters, which American actors render under direction in fleeting Hollywood Edwardian.  The accents come and go chasing the screenplay's segues first to Colette's very different style and then to more modern takes on women's wares and tears, all to dress up and down what two people are deciding nobility obliges.  Together Hampton, Frears and Friend keep the tale's surprise.  While Lea has been no nanny but doubly nude throughout, a delicately draped performance by Pfeiffer, Friend's dandy shows himself, in retrospect, the moralist at his wit's end. The only touch missing is a real picture of Kathy Bates when she was an ingenue of the first water, as her character in the corps de ballet.",1285113600,4,787,5.0852713178294575

I wasn't really expecting much because I'm honestly just not a fan of michelle pfeiffer, but surprisingly, this movie follows the book very well, and also captures the overall mood and tone of the story. I wouldn't say that this movie as a whole is really good, it can be bland at times, and for some reason I found the annoying ""narrator"" very distracting, but Michelle definitely embodied the role and so did the male actor who played Cheri.

3859964,2,B00275EGY2,"Now that I have watched this film, I understand why it never got a general release and went straight to DVD.  It's the worst Michelle Pfeiffer film ever.  Of course, even a bad Michelle Pfeiffer film is not entirely without some redeeming value, but in this case that value is limited entirely to watching Michelle and her glorious outfits, and even she is working from a weak script.  Most of the acting, including, and maybe especially, Kathy Bates [overacting her part to the max] is awful.  But the biggest flaw in this film is that the protagonist, Cherie, has no redeeming value whatsoever.  He's the type of male parasite who used to exist in class-stratified old England but really deserved to be put to work---or even better, put to permanent sleep---so people around him would not have to suffer his insufferable arrogance and tediousness. If the central character is a dud, it's hard to get very excited about a film.

Still, bad as this clunker is, it hasn't diminished my fantasy of some night having a lonely Michele Pfeiffer crawl into bed with me [provided my wife agrees, of course].",1270252800,4,1100,4.7631578947368425
3859965,4,B00275EGY2,"Colette would have approved. Despite some uneven casting, ""Cheri"" ultimately works onscreen. Kathy Bates is terribly miscast and misdirected. Michelle Pfeiffer struggles in the beginning, but ends up breaking your heart. Surprisingly it is the newcomer Rupert Friend (real-life boyfriend of Keira Knightley) as ""Cheri"" who is the glue that holds the piece together. He takes the viewer on a remarkable journey through the selfish psyche of a young man lost in a world he thinks he knows all too well. He shows us the callousness of a young spoiled rascal in the milleu of the Belle Epoque of courtesans and opium. It is Cheri who keeps us guessing as to what is going to happen. Pfeiffer ruins the surprise because a third of the way through she is already playing the ending.

I argued with a friend of mine who didn't think Pfeiffer was a convincing prostitute. But in the Belle Epoque, these women were not mere mortals. Kings gave their kingdoms away for the love of such beauties. And Pfeiffer is certainly in that category. Plus she does play the dichotomy in her character: a woman who loves Cheri as both a mother and a lover.

I can tell you're interested. I'll write no more, except to say, as I always say, take a chance on love. It's well worth it.",1269475200,23,1260,4.645739910313901

Cheri is the son of Charlotte (Kathy Bates)and archrival of Lea (Michelle Pfeiffer),which Charlotte wants Lea to teach Cheri a spoiled 19 year old boy about women. Lea and Charlotte are a couple of courtesans (high class prostitutes); Lea is thinking of quitting the profession until Charlotte asks her to teach her son about women. Lea invites Cheri to go with her for a weekend to get away from his mother in order to teach him about women and how they should be treated. Cheri and Lea end up being together for six years. Cheri's mother arranged a marriage for him with a young girl. Cheri got married and didn't realize till after the marriage took place that he was truly in love with Lea. Lea realized after Cheri got married she was also in love with Cheri. Both Lea and Cheri were very miserable without each other. Lea tried to go on and let Cheri fade out of her life but she was unable to succeed in that; she tried to have relationships with other young men ,but was unable to let go of her feelings towards Cheri, and was very miserable until she heard Cheri left his wife. Lea was happy to hear Cheri left his wife and hoped to get back together with him. Cheri went to Lea and spent the night with her, but the next morning when they arose the situation had changed between them, Lea tried to arrange for them to go away ,but Cheri did not like Lea treating him as if he was twelve years old. Cheri and Lea had a discussion about their relationship and Lea told him to return to his wife and be happy since she was and old woman and him so much younger than her. Cheri went back to his wife reluctantly, still wanting Lea ,but also knowing she was the only woman he could ever love. Lea had never been in real love before Cheri. Lea was devastated and realized she was and old woman. Cheri committed suicide after returning from war.

3859970,2,B00275EGY2,"When a movie doesn't quite succeed, there are many possible explanations. Perhaps the actor playing the title character was insufficient to the job, or perhaps he wasn't given enough to work with. Perhaps the bigger-name female star bent the project to make her character the center, and that threw off the balance. Perhaps the story is set in a world long gone, and none of the movie-making team could quite get into the mindset enough to make it all seem plausible.

Any one of those problems -- or all of them, or others -- may have been responsible for CHERI. Or, perhaps, the movie was successful, and it was this viewer who failed to properly appreciate it. But, for one reason or another, it didn't quite work -- and it didn't work entirely because I couldn't see what Michele Pfeiffer's Lea -- or anyone, for that matter -- could possibly see in the vapid, self-obsessed, lethargic, dull and unpleasant young man called Cheri.

Cheri (Rupert Friend) is attractive and young, yes -- but Lea is a high-class courtesan of long standing, and has extracted tens of thousands of francs from better men than him before breakfast. He's the son of one of her few friends, former courtesan Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates, unaccountably overemphasizing too many syllables in her speeches), and Peloux more or less asks Lea to take Cheri and educate him.

She supposedly does this -- they're together for six years, from when Cheri is nineteen -- but he's just as unpleasant and tedious at the end as at the beginning. We see no sign that he's gained any maturity or poise, and he never treats Lea well. He's mildly obsessed with her, or at least with keeping her from having affairs with anyone else, but that's as far as his interest in anything outside himself goes.

Pfeiffer is radiant, and allows herself to age (gracefully) as the movie goes on. But she's emoting in a void, since Friend's part is written (or acted, or edited -- it's difficult to see exactly where the fault lay) entirely in one note. CHERI does not seem to want to be the story of how one aging woman makes a horrible mistake in her love life and never realizes it, but that's the story it ends up telling. The intrusive narration, which also attempts to tell us what to feel without much effect, doesn't help the cause.

Cheri does have several nice sex scenes, demurely staged, between Pfeiffer and Friend, who are both quite attractive. For some viewers, that will be enough. But those who are interested in the story, and who like to see a little reciprocity, or plausibility, in their love stories, will end up disappointed.",1259971200,2,2597,4.68640350877193

Michelle Pfieffer is glorious as the older courtesan (Lea) who falls in love with the aimless 19 year old Cheri, son of a rival aging courtesan (played by Kathy Bates). The relationship between Lea and Cheri (Rupert Friend) is never developed properly in the beginning - in fact it feels quite rushed and forced, so you never get a sense of connection between these two  from the start. They also have virtually nothing in the way of on-screen chemistry. Rupert Friend turns in a one-dimensional portrait of a dark and brooding Cheri...the other actors, with the exception of Kathy Bates, are instantly forgettable. Shame too because the staging is lovely and this is probably one of Pfieffer's best performances. Overdubbed narration offers entirely unncessary commentary on what's going on in the minds of the characters, and utterly undermines every attempt the film makes to build and maintain a sense of real drama.
