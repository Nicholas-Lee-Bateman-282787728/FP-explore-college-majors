7893795,4,6305752710,"Wrestling-wise,much better then WWE's Wrestlemania 15(of that same year by the way)but story-wise,not so great. The best match on the card was the Bret Hart-Chris Benoit champioship match and the worst match on the same card was the David Flair-Kimberly Page match. The rest are not great but pretty good. The worst moment there was Perry Saturn hitting the low blow on Torrie Wilson despite the fact that women have no you-know-what down there. I give this event a 8 out of 10",1273536000,,477,4.759036144578313
7893796,5,6305752710,"I Know Others will review the matches! This will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt why WCW is and will always be better than WW-Mc-""Man""(HHH IS KING)
FACT: people on AMAZON Say this is the worst time for WCW DON'T GET ANY THING FROM 1999 -2000 ! I SAY GET ANYTHING YOU CAN FROM WCW ! OK LETS GO TO THIS ""DOWN"" EVENT !
FIRST OF ALL: WE OPEN UP WITH A GUY IN THE CROWD IN TORONTO DOING A PRETTY GOOD COMEDY IMPROV BEHIND COMMENTATORS ""TONY C"" & ""Brain"" ! Do you think ""WWMaC""  would allow that NO! In Come security and that would be stopped !
Second , during the six man tag -match highlighting the beautiful Torrie Wilson a guy has a sign in the front row saying who booked this crap!
Anyone will tell you Big Mac talks down to other promotions saying for example TNA is not in our league but try bringing a TNA Sign to a wwe event or chant TNA, TNA, TNA, .... YES THE SIGN IS NOT ALLOWED AND U WILL BE ESCORTED OUT OF BUILDING ! SO IT IS GREAT TO SEE WCW LET SOMEONE EXPRESS THEIR OPINION ABOUT TORRIE ""BARBIE DOLL"" WILSON WRESTLING BAREFOOT

The NEXT REASON One Should Get This IS AN ACTUAL FAN (NO ACTOR OR WRESTLER) ATTACKS DEAN MILENKO WITH A HOCKEY STICK during THIS SAME SIX-MAN MATCH!
THE LAST REASON IS THE JIM ROSS IMPERSONATOR WALKING OUT WITH JR'S FAVORITE WRESTLER Steve ""dr. death"" Williams ! Oklahoma cracks me up with his Sauerkraut bowl stats & ""Vampiro"" shouts & ""GOOD GOD SOMEBODY STOP THE MATCH ! ""CHOKE SLAM, CHOKE SLAM""
I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE JUMP OVER THE RAIL IN OTHER WCW EVENTS AND INTO THE RING & TO SEE A FAN ATTACK MILENKO TONIGHT WAS GREAT!
I WAS AT RON SIMMONS FIRST MATCH IN THE FRONT ROW & HE ASKED FOR MY BEER IN WHICH HE USED ON HIS OPPONENT -I WILL NEVER FORGET IT BUT BIG MAC WOULD HAVE ME ARRESTED !
I LOVE WRESTLING BUT I HATE ALL THE MaC lovers out there! do your research that family ruined this business! I'M sorry your step-dad abused you when you were young but Vince could you send down HHH TO Ohio Valley to develop a new character & let some fans work for the company instead of ""YES PEOPLE"" apparently VINCE told his step-dad ""no"" a few times !",1233187200,,2086,4.135467980295567
7893797,3,6305752710,"This is a happy moment for me (i live in Canada) but come on 5 stars- 4 stars?? this was 3 at best

First off there were 12 matches i think but only four were good ( the tournament matches and the hardcore title)

i mean Goldberg vs. Sid Vicious- WTF is this?? before the match sid is like ``I will never quit`` and then after about four minutes the match is over....come on

And what was with the six person intergender elimination? Perry beats Torrie Wilson with a low blow????

Luger vs. Meng was pathetic

Buff vs. Henning was decent

I forgot Disco Inferno vs. some guy called Couragous- this is sopost to be cruiserweight this was BOOrring

Booker T vs. Scot Hall was decent but nothing worth watching twice

well there is more but it all sux

Almost every match was Booooooooooooooring as the crowd keeps reminding us. This video below par compared to wwe but for WCW its decent- Please Dont Buy it for more than 15$",1108857600,,923,4.382352941176471
7893798,2,6305752710,"I'm not sure how much other people watch wrestling, but this is by far the worst wrestling video i have even bought.  the matches have poorly choreography and the story lines are so typical.  no wonder WCW went out of business... it's because of matches like theses...",1108080000,,268,4.680851063829787
7893799,5,6305752710,"this was by far the best WCW event of 1999. This event had it all. from top to bottom, this event was stacked. 2 excellent matches from both Bret Hart and Chris Benoit. Jeff Jarrett and Sting worked the ring masterfully in their respective semi-final matches. Sid and Goldberg put on a very emotional match. This event had a tremendous finish with 2 of the best technical wrestlers of our time giving it all for the WCW World Heavyweight title. a great ending for the 32-man/woman tournament for the title. a well deserved champion was crowned and this was the night where Benoit really got his career going.

this is a must have for fans of WCW, great technical wrestling, Bret Hart, and Chris Benoit",1100908800,2,701,4.608
7893800,4,6305752710,"Bret Hart spent two years in a tailspin in WCW and then at mayhem he proved that he could still pull out the ""Hitman Magic""

 as he and Chris Benoit told a great story in the ring!",1091404800,,180,3.8378378378378377
7893801,5,6305752710,this was the best pay-per-view ive seen in a long time. he all canada final rocked. david flair and kimberely wass cool too. in closing this ppv was stocked front to back. i strongly erge you to get this ppv,980294400,,207,4.2
7893802,5,6305752710,"One of the most memorable PPV in wrestling history, if you are a Bret  Hitman Hart fan you must have this video, as he won WCW heavyweight  championship tournament that night in Canada, I know and we all know that  Bret Hitman Hart is The Best There Is, The Best There Was, And The Best  There Ever Will Be!",962582400,,307,4.1525423728813555
7893803,4,6305752710,"The current state of WCW really disgusts me as a long-time fan, but I'll have to say that this PPV was very solid. This PPV marked one of the few times Chris Benoit was in a high profile WCW match, and it didn't  disappoint. Definitely worth a look.",961113600,,249,4.1875
7893804,3,6305752710,This was a fair to good effort from WCW.  With all the turmoil in the front-office they were able to put on a classic Main-Event.  Bret Hart is a WRESTLER and Chris Benoit provided a suitable opponent.  Too Bad they don't  try like this every month.,955411200,,249,4.3478260869565215
