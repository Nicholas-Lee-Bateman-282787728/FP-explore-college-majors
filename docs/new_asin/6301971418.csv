411970,3,6301971418,"In this creepy, atmospheric sequel to ""House of Dark Shadows"",  Quentin Collins(David Selby), the last of the surviving Collins clan, moves  into the Gothic Collinwood estate with his beautiful young bride,  Tracy(Kate Jackson) only to discover that the place is a breeding-ground  for the supernatural. This leads to several encounters with a captivating  18th-century witch, Angelique(Lara Parker) who makes married life very  difficult for the frightened duo to say the least. Admittedly, the film  can't hold a candle to its predecessor(any technical problems the film has  is due to the fact that it was cut to ribbons before finally being  released), but this is probably as good a sequel as the filmmakers could  have come up with after the stunning ""House of Dark Shadows"".  Like the original, the film features a number of the series players,  including Selby and Jackson in their film debuts, and boasts some truly  striking Gothic atmosphere. Rumor has it that the missing footage from  ""Night of Dark Shadows"" is in the process of being restored, and  should be released, hopefully, by the end of next year.",968803200,16,1119,5.104972375690608

Okay, so it's not ""House of Dark Shadows,"" but it is a chance to see some of your favorite DS players in a strange  ""parallel-time"" story. Same great locations as in  ""HODS,"" that great Bob Cobert music, the beautiful Lara Parker as  Angelique, and the FANTASTIC Grayson Hall as Carlotta, the Collinwood  housekeeper with a keen fashion sense who quite simply doesn't like the new  Mrs. Quentin Collins!

412022,4,6301971418,"While many of the original actors return for this movie, none reprise their original role, which isn't a bad thing, just a bit odd watching people you know as one character play someone else. Also, the story line is different from the original series, again not a bad thing, just different. There are a few dialogue and scene snafu's due to the editing, but you can easily figure out what is happening if you are paying attention. I would call this a fun nostalgic walk down memory lane, but not something I would watch again. The acting is good, the filming is what you would expect from a low budget film of that era, the story is OK, but there are some holes in it - again, what you expect from this era. All in all worth watching for nostalgic reminiscing, just wish it was free.",1505779200,,783,4.36986301369863
412023,2,6301971418,"A gothic ghost story that could have been uniquely creepy all on its own; but the studios refused to play it as Dan Curtis filmed it.  This is more like the Collinwood of another time and dimension.  One could label this a parallel time story.  Only Liz Stoddard connects the two movies--though she is dead when this film begins.  The rest of whoever was left alive at the end of the first film are completely obliterated.
Whatever you see in this film is an illusion; if you read the script of the shot film, this movies does not even closely represent that script.
Originally Curtis had attempted a sequel to House of Dark Shadows; but Frid refused (he did not want to be typecast!).  Unfortunately, this is the schizophrenia of J. Frid.  Instead of rolling with it and giving his all one last time, he decided superstardom to be next on the agenda.  Oblivion was on the menu, though, and he was all but washed up after HODS.
It is too bad.  I have never seen a man so devoted, yet jealous and spiteful concerning a role that made him a household name.  Frid had a sort of love/hate relationship with the show, which why Night of Dark Shadows came into being.  It is also regretable that a novelization of this film was never written.  It would have given fans a clearer picture of what the movie was about instead the hacked, confused version one views.  They keep talking of putting the film back together as Curtis intended; but it has been quite a while and a ""director's cut"" may never materialize.  We shall see.

IN CHRIST JESUS!

412024,3,6301971418,"Barely understandable even to most fans, because the film was chopped to pieces. Dan Curtis wanted to release a director's cut, but was never able to do so, partly due to the death of Grayson Hall. Another problem is that most of the familiar actors play different roles. Quentin isn't even a werewolf.
On the other hand, it features the debut of Kate Jackson, who never looked so beautiful, IMO.",1504310400,,396,4.671428571428572

Not sure why critics pan this movie so much. Grayson Hall is amazingly eerie and David Selby also did a superb job going in and out of his possessed state. Love the others as well. They just don't make smart horror movies any more. Well, there are a handful, but those are mainly made in Britain. Pardon my views, but it's true.

412137,5,6301971418,"Just finished, along with Jeff H., watching ""Night Of Dark Shadows"" released by Warner Brothers.
""Night of Dark Shadows"" is a traditional haunted house movie that builds the intrigue and horror slowly as newlyweds Quentin [David Selby reprising his role from the television series] and Tracy [Kate 'Charlie's Angels' Jackson Collins who arrive in Collinsport as the new lord and lady of the Collinswood Manor - Mrs. Stoddard had just recently passed away.
With just a hint of old troubles and mental instabilities mentioned in casual conversation on the road up to the manor; the newlyweds arrive and soon experience the dark undercurrents that flow in and out of the accursed house of Collinswood.
Don't expect to see Barnabas Collins lurking in the shadows.  Not even by way of a cameo by his portrait.
Angelique is the dark supernatural influence in this second movie.
[Side note:  All throughout this movie Jeff H. muttered how much David Selby and Zack look so much alike.]
Angelique wants to resume the life that was cut so drastically short when she was hung as a witch from an old oak tree on the grounds of Collinswood over looking the manor.  In order to set that scheme into motion, she seduces Quentin, who is a painter, through means of memories of their past life together and through means of an eerie tune he sometimes hums to himself.
As Quentin slips into madness, he completes the painting, and Tracy finds soon finds herself fighting for not only her life, but her husband's life and soul as well.
""Night of Dark Shadows"" - the fully restored version - is a masterpiece of traditional Gothic horror at its best.  If only Warner Brothers hadn't made that foolish request of Dan Curtis to cut the film down to 90 minutes from over two hours, then there probably would have been a third Dark Shadows movie produced and directed by Dan Curtis.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

412223,5,6301971418,"Absolutely wonderful sequel to House of Dark Shadows, despite not having necessarily any connections between the two. Or really the show for that matter. Yes it takes place at Collinwood and yes Quentin and Angelique are there, but this is definitely different than the television series. That being said it's absolutely wonderful and the only similarities are character names and actors here really, but I loved it. John Karlen, Nancy Barrett, James Storm, Kate Jackson and Grayson Hall all have roles in the movie as well and they play them very well. The story is still very well done despite missing the extra 30 minutes originally planed for the film. Some scenes do seem cut and sparse. but it still works really well. A really vague synopsis here: Quentin and Tracy inherit Collinwood and Quentin starts having odd visions and nightmares involving the painting of a beautiful woman (Angelique of course), which start to cause problems for Quentin and Tracy. The housekeeper Carlotta and stable hand Gerard don't seem to notice anything and are the opposite of helpful to Tracy. The problems in the home escalate and their friends Alex and Claire, a book writing married couple are intensely worried and come to help Quentin and Tracy. Things don't end exactly how you'd expect, but nonetheless makes for a good ending. I absolutely love this movie and you really have to go into this not thinking of the tv series, but to be honest with the many varying story lines of the show this could have made it's own story arc had it been given the time and the show not ended that is.",1425254400,4,1583,4.781021897810219
412224,3,6301971418,"First, with that Johnny Dreck and Dep[pity Doo mockery of Dark Shadows, and now the sloppy and shoddy DVD/Bluray releases of the original films.
Dan Curtis filmed the House and night of Dark Shadows films in 1:33:1 aspect ratio (full size, or 4:3 old style TV full screen ratio. Warner bros, in their infinite stupidity, letterboxed the films, cropping the top and bottom of the picture, so you are missing 1/2 the picture. Had it been properly transferred, on a regular TV, you'd see the full picture, on a 16:9 HDTV, you'd see bars at the left and right - but you'd be seeing the films as shot by the director. Apparently, the suits decided it was better to appease the widescreeners and cut half the picture. So, no foreheads and chins in close up, and so on. Seriously, first they could do a proper restoration of missing footage that's been found for NODS, and now butchering both films like this? C'mon, Warner Brothers, if you could bankroll that Johnny Dreck piece of s***, then surely coming up with the money to put these films on DVD and bluray correctly would have been a far better investment - and a lot cheaper than Deppity Doo's fiasco and mockery of the source.

412279,5,6301971418,"Even in its truncated (post-edited) form, it's a great, fun thriller.  Damn Jim Aubrey (""the smiling cobra"" of CBS in the early 1960s, the man who axed Judy Garland from her 1963 TV variety series after only one season because she refused sleep with him (Judy, separated from her husband, Sid Luft, was at the time romantically involved with David Begelman, one of her managers, whom she loved and hoped to marry---Begelman's own marriage of this period was hardly more blissful than Judy's---even though Begelman, six years after Judy's death, had the whistle blown on him by actor Cliff Robertson for forging Robertson's $50,000 ""film location"" expense checks; a thorough investigation revealed Begelman had bilked hundreds of thousands of dollars out of not only Judy but virtually every client he represented, for 15 or more years, and he was thereafter treated with contempt within the agency business, and consequently took his life in 1991), and the one who sounded the death knell, as presiding CEO(!)of MGM, in 1970 with the MGM auction, for ordering the film be cut yet another 30 minutes (which producer Dan Curtis had already done to the originally 150-minute film to a reasonable two hours), because Aubrey deemed it a mere ""B-movie potboiler"" (anyone who would fire Judy Garland in her prime could hardly be complimented with either good judgment or respecting the lady many show biz historians have christened ""the world's greatest female entertainer"" of the 20th Century (please note: ""the world's greatest female ENTERTAINER---not just singer, dancer, and actress, but all three; of what's out there today, arguably, only Barbra Streisand stands alone, and Judy was both one of Barbra's earliest mentors and champions, insisting that Barbra be the sole guest star early in the season of her 1963-64 TV variety series---and Barbra, for all her other sterling qualities, is neither the natural nor trained dancer Garland proved to be throughout her entire profession life; however, Barbra's success as a film director more than makes up for not being a remarkable dancer) much less a judge of a class-A motion picture---but, I understand, a ""length restoration"" of the cut print is in progress.

I went to see the picture (at a drive-in, which I loved) on, if memory for dates serves correctly, on Friday, August 11 or 13th(?),1971(it was my parents' birthday gift to me; on August 13th, I turned 11 years of age, and had literally grown up, along with a million other kids and adults of all ages, on the 5-year series, which had been discontinued four months earlier, in mid-April which, astonishingly, made the film even more of a box-office success).  It was on the top of a double bill with ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" (1967), starring Roman Polanski and the incandescently lovely (and talented) Sharon Tate (not a success in 1967 but a cult classic today), making for a perfect evening at the movies, compliments of what was left of poor MGM, which distributed both pictures.  However, a restoration of the missing 30 minutes is reportedly in progress (I consider ""Night of Dark Shadows"" the horror/suspense example of what happened to the original, 1954 musical version of ""A Star Is Born"" which, due to the greed of Warner Bros., caved in to pressure---by equally greedy nationwide theatre owners---to have THAT diamond of a motion picture shortened by almost 30 minutes, six weeks AFTER its premiere and distribution across the country, during which the picture was being hailed by film critics as a musical-film masterpiece and box office triumph; it was the first picture to be restored under the funding, starting in 1983, to restore cut, poorly-marketed and/or ""lost"" classic motion pictures, starting a tradition that still rescues Hollywood art forms, thanks to the Motion Picture Association of Arts and Sciences, from further damage, obscurity, and/or extinction. Judy would have been so proud, since it has been cited as being her finest three hours on the screen, for which she received the first of two ""regulation"" Oscar nominations, having been awarded a ""special"" Oscar for ""The Wizard of Oz"" in 1940---and a ""special Tony Award for her Palace Theatre Concert Engagement in 1952---the award for Best Actress of 1954 that year went to---of all people---Grace Kelly, for ""The Country Girl"", against other far more deserving nominees that year such as Audrey Hepburn, Jane Wyman, Dorothy Dandridge, and Garland herself. Film historians today Garland lost the award to Kelly because Kelly was under contract to her former nemesis, MGM, and simply, because most Academy voters were denied seeing ""A Star Is Born"" uncut and in its full glory, at odds with themselves for voting for a performance that, until 1983, was no longer there in its entirety, though it is agreed that, even in its truncated form, Garland acted Kelly off the screen nonetheless (including those who state that Kelly couldn't act at all, by comparison to the four other actresses nominated along with Judy).

But now, Aubrey is long dead (let's hope, unlike at Collinwood, reincarnation is not an option for James Aubrey!) and ""Night of Dark Shadows"" will be restored to its own uncut glory, a classic of its genre, watched, rewatched, and remembered long after James Aubrey, show business assassin, has long been forgotten (which he already has been, in many respects, due to his gross abuses of power and his destructive mismanagement and mistreatment of the Hollywood art form of television, film, and the hugely talented people, in front of and behind the cameras, who made them special).

Up yours, Aubrey!  Time, wiser and more distinguished heads, unforgettably powerhouse talents and great entertainment will outlive the foul memory of you, forever.",1414972800,3,5764,5.106044538706256

  This is not Dan Curtis best.  I don't know what it is, He is the creator that loves Ghost Stories and he has amazing work with the horror classics, but he never can make a Ghost story of his own work.  Its slow and at times boring.  although you see a more of the house and the country side that you didn't in ""House of Dark Shadows"" , which I find so pleasurable, and with the music, it is most relaxing.  I don't think this is the affect Dan Curtis had in mind when he made this movie, but that's what I get from it. LOL",1408320000,,770,4.155405405405405

I love this film because it strongly features Kate Jackson and Grayson Hall, two of my favorite actresses from the show, but the narrative is extremely hard to follow because of substantial cuts Dan Curtis was forced to make to the film by the studio.  John Karlen and Nancy Barrett's characters and storyline are all but incomprehensible in the pared down version.  The footage has been retrieved as well as most of the audio, but apparently they are trying to figure out the best way to finish reconstructing the movie since one of the scenes that is missing audio features Grayson Hall who has passed away.  Hopefully someday a complete version of the film, even if it features a sketchy dub for the missing audio, will be available, but for now you can watch this and enjoy it - just don't try to figure out every bit of the plot!",1403654400,7,1013,4.549450549450549

Plus, Lara Parker never fails to captivate as Angelique Collins, the ghost witch with those big, beautiful super power blue peepers of hers!

It may be simply a sequel to the first movie ""House of Dark Shadows.""  If this is the case and you can suspend the knowledge of what you already know about the story and characters, than this little odd film becomes a tad more enjoyable.

412483,5,6301971418,"Night of Dark Shadows was the second of two feature length movies based on the popular 1960s' TV soap opera, Dark Shadows. However, it is not considered to be a sequel to first film, House of Dark Shadows. Resurrecting Barnabas was scrapped for the second film when Mr. Frid declined to portray the popular vampire. Dan Curtis and writer Sam Hall decided to create a new storyline based on the popular Quentin Collins character. NODS takes place some time after the tragic events in HODS. Elizabeth Collins Stoddard had passed, thus making Quentin the legal heir to the vast estate. He arrives with his young wife, the beautiful Kate Jackson. Soon after their arrival, Quentin his haunted by the ghost of his ancestor, Charles Collins, a talented painter, who found himself in an extramarital affair with his brother's beautiful wife, Angelique Collins. In 1810, Angelique is hanged for witchcraft, and her lover, Charles, is likewise sealed alive in her tomb. Quentin is tormented by these flashbacks. Stranger still, he is slowly becoming possessed by Charles Collins, and manipulated by his gorgeous lover, Angelique, the witch.

Night of Dark Shadows is my favorite of the two feature length movies. I was pleased when it finally went to DVD. The movie had been digitally remastered 1.65:1 widescreen format, with Dolby sound. The one drawback is the original film was 129 minutes. Dan Curtis stated MGM forced him to edit 35 minutes from the final cut which is 94 minutes. These lost scenes created ambiguity in the film. However, it is still a pretty good movie. The gothic setting and spooky soundtrack is classic Dark Shadows. Selby, Grayson Hall, John Karlen, Chris Pennock, and James Storm are excellent. The beautiful women of DS, Lara Parker, Nancy Barrett, and Kate Jackson are equally talented. I recommend this DVD to all fans of Dark Shadows.",1375747200,4,1858,4.993548387096774

412676,3,6301971418,This movie goes two steps beyond the world created by the TV gothic horror soap opera.  This is not a horro film that wraps up nicely.  It hits hard and ends as many 1970s horror films did - in a dark fashion.  This loosely-based sequel House of dark Shadows has the same dark and fore-boding feel as that one but the characters are not well-developed.  David Selby plays his role well but the film does lack depth and interesting supporting characters.,1359763200,,453,4.555555555555555
412677,4,6301971418,"It's well known that Night Of Dark Shadows suffered extensively from pre-release cutting, and those cuts severely compromised the film. The storyline became confusing, and the editing looked choppy in places. However in spite of these drawbacks, this follow on from House Of Dark Shadows - it's not really a sequel in the conventional sense - remains worthwhile, both for fans of director Dan Curtis' original Dark Shadows TV series, and casual viewers.

One obvious aspect that causes disappointment is the absence of Barnabas Collins. Actor Jonathan Frid had refused to play the vampire again through fears of typecasting, so Curtis was forced to take a different tack. Night focuses on Quentin Collins and his wife Tracy as they inherit the Collinwood estate. Slowly, the couple become aware of the malevolent spirit of Angelique, a witch hanged 200 years ago, and Quentin is posessed by the spirit of his own ancestor, Angelique's lover. The films lacks the blood and thunder of it's predecessor, opting instead for a slow, brooding build up of menace and a surprisingly dark tone of sexual violence in some scenes.

Hopefully, one day the cut footage will be restored, but in the meantime this flawed gem is more deserving of it's place on your shelf next to House Of Dark Shadows than Tim Burton's new movie.",1359676800,3,1314,4.968181818181818

412725,4,6301971418,"The makers of ""Night of Dark Shadows"" had to be pretty creative when some of their series regulars balked at appearing in another big screen installment.  Give credit where credit is due this film doesn't reach the heights of ""House of Dark Shadows"" but is reasonably spellbinding.  Instead of recreating an episode of the serial the makers create a whole new universe and series regulars(Grayson Hall, John Karlen, Thayer David et al) play completely different characters.  David Selby's darkly brooding Quentin Collins is not the werewolf he's better known as but a man possessed by spirits of Collinwood past.  Lara Parker also contributes as the sultry ethereal witch Angelique.  Whereas the preceding film took its cues from Hammer ""Night of Dark Shadows"" is more like a supernatural gothic horror film.  What it reminds me of is a later film by series creator Dan Curtis, ""Burnt Offerings"".  ""Night of Dark Shadows"" feels like a dry run to ""Burnt Offerings"".",1357776000,4,964,5.063291139240507

412826,4,6301971418,"It's a great time to be a fan of ""Dark Shadows."" Thanks to Tim Burton's revamp, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment has seen fit to give enthusiasts of the gothic / horror soap what they've wanted for years - high-definition editions of the theatrical releases ""House of Dark Shadows"" and ""Night of Dark Shadows."" ""House of Dark Shadows"" is an abridged version of the Barnabas Collins storyline of the popular television show. However, creator / director Dan Curtis was forced to explore different plot avenues with ""Night of Dark Shadows.""

""Night of Dark Shadows"" focuses on the arrival of artist Quentin Collins (David Selby) and his wife, Tracy (Kate Jackson), to his newly inherited home, Collinwood. He's greeted by the mysterious housekeeper, Carlotta Drake (Grayson Hall), and the caretaker, Gerard Stiles (Jim Storm). Quentin begins having visions of a past existence in which he's having an affair with his brother's wife, Angelique (Lara Parker).

As he digs deeper into the family history, he discovers Angelique was hung on the property for accusations of being a witch. Are his trances truly memories of a former life? Can he keep the evil spirit of Angelique from destroying his family and friends and driving him insane?

Where ""House of Dark Shadows"" is quickly paced, this indirect sequel plods along nicely and establishes a storyline and a sense of fear and creepiness. The problem is what it builds up to. The conclusion of the film is rather abrupt and unsatisfying. There's also a similarity to director Curtis's ending of his 1976 film ""Burnt Offerings,"" which I find interesting in hindsight.

It's obvious when viewing the movie that it suffered some final cuts in the editing room. Long-time enthusiasts of the show know the history behind the making of the film and the existence of lost footage. Director Curtis was given 24 hours to re-cut the movie from 129 minutes to 94 minutes by MGM.

Fans of the film petitioned to have the chopped sequences restored and a director's cut released. The footage was found in 1999, but it was without sound. The scenes are said to give ""Night of Dark Shadows"" a darker mood and reinstate the original cohesion and framework of the film. It's unfortunate that what we get here is still the 94-minute version released by the studio in 1971. However, beggars can't be choosers.

The high-definition transfer gives viewers a restored picture they'll be happy with. It's clean but doesn't take away from the classic flavor of the movie. The 1.0 audio will no doubt disappoint most consumers. It still sounds good, but an upgrade would have been nice.

There are no real special features included. The only thing we get is a theatrical trailer for the film. As I said about the ""House of Dark Shadows"" Blu-ray release, ""Would it have been too much trouble to include a short featurette about the making of the movie?"" I know the actors of the original ""Dark Shadows"" are rather personable, so I'm sure they would've sat down with someone to talk about this film.

""Night of Dark Shadows"" on Blu-ray still delivers what fans of the TV show want. It gives them a great looking high-definition version of a film which was impossible to find in any DVD format. The movie itself might have some problems, but it's still an entertaining watch.",1353283200,,3294,4.880143112701252

In some ways her presence made up for having lost Alexandra Moltke's Victoria Winters character, since they were somewhat similar.  The over all tone of this movie is very gothic and mysterious like it should be.  David Selby's performance is another strong reason to love this movie.  The plotline was actually not original, since the TV series had a parallel time storyline that involved Quentin returning to Collinwood with a new bride who had to deal with the ghost of Angelique.  But it doesn't matter because it still managed to capture much of the soap opera's original flavor by borrowing another story from the TV series.  The flashbacks between the present and the past also added much dimension to the script.  This was a nice piece of nostalgia for any fan of the original series...",1353024000,,951,4.721212121212122

If you check out the original VHS versions of these two films, you'll actually see MORE of the movie than you do here. Many matted home movie products will lose top/bottom views, but add to the left/right presentation (the widescreen version of ""The Shining"" is a good example). So what we get here is actually LESS  movie than is seen on VHS and/or cable TV (such as when Turner Classics shows the films - catch them in HD there if you want good quality AND the full picture). Yes, the DVD quality makes these films look a lot better than videotape, but I wanted to see MORE of the sets and locations of the Lyndhurst mansion and grounds, NOT less. But what should we expect from a company who have chosen not to add in the restored 35-minutes of deleted scenes to NODS, instead opting to release what is basically a pretty incoherent, and disappointing hack job.",1352246400,4,1214,4.594470046082949

I've read the comments concerning the eleventh hour editing and would enjoy seeing the full feature.
Compared to contemporary horror films, NODS seems plodding or lethargic, but its deliberate pacing actually adds to the impending doom and the inevitable conclusion.  I enjoyed seeing the TV series actors in different roles.  I wish the stunning Lara Parker had more screen time...she was always my favorite on the soap and have to wonder why she never had a successful post-Shadows career.  Now in her 70s, Miss Parker is still a lovely woman.

The movie has always been a favorite (maybe Im in the minority) but it has some good suspense.  I look past a few of the choppy bits to what it does offer--a truly scary ghost story.

The movie probably hasn't looked or sounded this good since its original release in 1971. It's a real treat to again see this film in widescreen format with such sharp images and vibrant colors. There's a scene where the two main characters, Quentin and Tracy Collins, are exploring the basement of Collinwood holding candelabras that is just visually stunning.

Fans of the film and the original tv-series will, of course, be disappointed that the long awaited ""restored footage"" is not included. This is the same cut of the film that was released to VHS in 1990, so it's actually a slightly edited version of the edited version that Dan Curtis delivered to the theaters. One scene I know for sure was longer in the original distribution is the scene when Quentin is assaulting Tracy in their bedroom about two-thirds of the way through the movie. There's an abrupt edit so you'll notice something was cut out when it happens. That said, this DVD version is still the best we can expect at this time and remains well worth a watch.

Grayson Hall, David Selby, Lara Parker, and Kate Jackson all deliver effective performances. The flashback sequences are very well done and harken to the time-travelling stories explored in the tv-series. The moody atmosphere is well captured and the gothic nature of the Lyndhurst Estate, used as Collinwood, adds its own eerie touch. Let's hope someday we can get a complete restored version of NIGHT OF DARK SHADOWS, but, even if we don't, I'm happy to at least have this best incarnation to date to watch.",1351900800,5,1684,4.783505154639175

1.  The story and mood differ greatly from the popular TV series.  Sure, there are various elements and moods from the original series, and Robert Cobert's soundtrack is based on many of the scores that were featured in the show.  But if you are looking for a big screen version of the stories featured in the series, you will be disappointed.  Unlike House of Dark Shadows, this film features a whole new Dark Shadows storyline.

2.  Dan Curtis was forced to trim the film at the last minute, giving him only 24 hours to make cuts.  And it really does show.  It's a shame that this footage has not been restored.

However, this is a film that deserves a second chance!  The mood is fantastic!  It's haunting, sexy, dark, strange, and beautifully Gothic.  The flashback sequences are truly amazing!  I wish that they had included more of those.  Thayer David gives a standout performance as the Rev. Strack.  Grayson Hall plays the enigmatic Carlotta, which I believe is her best role!  Yes, better than Dr. Hoffman.  She is stunning in this film!  I also really appreciated David Selby's performance.  He was truly scary!

By the time production near, the soap series was canceled by ABC and actor Jonathan Frid didn't want to return as fear of being typecast. Therefore, the co-writer and director Dan Curtis (creator of Dark Shadows) changed the title to Night of Dark Shadows and focused the main character onto Quentin Collins (played by David Selby), whom was absent from the previous film. This time the plot didn't involve vampires, but returned to Dark Shadows original theme of ghosts.

Quentin Collins along with his wife Tracy (played by Kate Jackson) arrives at their newly-inherited estate, Collinwood, as most of the Collins were killed in the previous film. Actress Grayson Hall returns, but she's playing a new role as the housekeeper Carlotta Drake. The couple is introduced to her and the caretaker Gerard Stiles. There is no mentioned of the events that happened in House of Dark Shadows.

The couple's novelists' friends Alex and Claire Jenkins (Played by returning actors John Karlen and Nancy Barrett, but in different roles.) move into the small cottage that is located on the estate. Quentin soon has weird and realistic dreams about his ancestor Charles Collins, who had an affair with Angelique (Once again played by actress Lara Parker.). Upon hearing about his dreams, Carlotta tells him that she is the reincarnation of Sarah Castle, a girl who once lived at Collinwood, and that he is the reincarnation of Charles Collins. Charles had a passionate affair with his brother's wife, Angelique. Because of their actions, Angelique was hanged and Charles was buried alive in her crypt.

Quentin becomes possessed by the spirit of Charles Collins and tries to drown Tracy. Meanwhile, the ghost of Angelique is haunting everyone.

The Night of Dark Shadows was somewhat inspired by the Angelique storyline, minus her being a witch, and the 1970 parallel timeline episodes. With the Dark Shadows serial being cancelled, MGM had lost faith with the movie. With hardly little notice, less than twenty-four hours, the executives forced Dan Curtis to cut the movie down so it could be aired in midnight double features. In today's words the movie was being sent straight-to-video. The result was the original 129 minutes running time being cut to 95 minutes. The final result left the main plot confusing, the characters one dimensional, and overall the movie looses its coherence.

The heart of the movie is a Gothic romantic novel. The scenes with the stunning Lara Parker are my favorites, but I would have liked it if Dan had left her a witch. But then again, I like that Dan used the basic ghost plot from the original year of the Dark Shadows serial. There is some good news. Back in 1999 the lost 35 minutes (16 scenes) were recovered, but with no surviving audio. Since then Warner Bros. (who is producing the remake) has bought both the movie's rights. They are restoring the movie to its original 129 minutes length along with new audio that has been created with the surviving actors. It was planned to be released along with House of Dark Shadows six months after the release of the remake, but the running time of Amazon has the DVD around ninety minutes. It looks the fans won't get a chance to see the original version unless the director's cut is an extra, but highly doubt it.

Despite Night of Dark Shadows being heavily edited, I enjoyed Dan Curtis's attempt at the dark ghostly Gothic romance, in which he's trying to do things he couldn't do on television at the time.

  I've been waiting for these two film to make it to disc for years. After
having worn out my vhs copies. While both films are good, HODS is the better
of the two. Being more faithful to the original storyline of how Barnabas Collins
came to Collinwood, and the tragic events that followed.
  NODS simply suffers from a badly scripted storyline. Due partly because filming
began only months after it was learn that the daytime soap was being cancelled.
Plus two of the lead stars in the tv show, Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennett had declined to do another big screen film. So it was decided to capitalize on David Selby's
popularity as Quintin Collins to create a new storyline.
  It starts with Quintin as a distant relation to the former owners of the great estate. Who inherits it after the last occupant dies. He is an artist who together with his wife Daphne, moves in to huge mansion to begin their new life.
  They find the place is cared for by a creepy housekeeper played by the late great
Grayson Hall. She begins to relates to them the sordid history of the place. Involving two
of Quintin's ancestors. One a namesake, and the other the wife of his brother, Angelique, who was accused of witchcraft tried and hanged. Anyway the story goes on from there. And unfortunately goes down from there! The big problem being that
35 minutes of explanatory storyline was cut from the film at the last minute.

I have been waiting for these two movies to be released on Blu- ray/DVD for years (I have both the Laserdisc and VHS versions.) I was saddened to read that this does not include the cut footage, but I still like this movie anyway.  Maybe someday there will be a restored version released.  I love the cover art to both movies, House having a red tint and Night having a blue tint with beautiful Collinwood in the background, but how can this movie be released without having Angelique on the front cover?  Lara Parker was never more beautiful than in this movie and she should be front and center on the cover.  Big mistake!

 The story revolves around Quentin Collins who inherits Collinwood and comes to live there with his wife Tracy. The stories involved gothic romance, parallel time and reincarnation. Although the movie was not as successful as the first the writing was superb (the script having been written by Dan Curtis and Sam Hall) and many from the original serial made superb appearances including Davis Selby as Quentin, Kate Jackson, Lara Parker, the wonderful Grayson Hall and most splendidly Diana Millay who plays Laura Collins a phoenix.

 At the last minute MGM ordered Curtis to cut a whopping 35 minutes from the final print in 24 hours! Many have said this led to the movie not making sense at times and became confusing for the audience.

I recently watched it again, though Instant Video and enjoyed it much.  I thought the storyline was pretty good (nothing ground-breaking) but I liked the actors and characters.  It was a Dark Shadows type story, but not a part of the  TV series.  If you are a DS fan, and you can get past familiar actors in unfamilar roles, I think you will like the movie.  The only thing I didn't care for was the amount of screaming -- there's quite a bit.

On a side note.  I recently watched the new Burton/Depp Dark Shadows movie.  Helena Bonham-Carter plays Julia Hoffman in the remake.  Grayson Hall played the character originally.

412900,5,6301971418,"With renewed interest in the ""Dark Shadows"" franchise because of the Johnny Depp film arriving in theatres in May, 2012 people have been wondering about the two movies that came out during the serial's original run. This particular film, ""Night of Dark Shadows"" actually arrived in theatres on August 4, 1971, practically four months to the day when ""Dark Shadows"" went off ABC for good. This first movie, ""House of Dark Shadows"" came out in 1970 and was a box office hit so Dan Curtis (the series creator) decided to do a sequel, but without much of the original cast including Jonathan Frid who said he didn't want to be typecast as Barnabas and he felt the script wasn't all that good. Joan Bennet, who starred as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, also refused to do the sequel. So, emphasis was put on Quentin Collins, played remarkably by Davis Shelby. Grayson Hall and Kate Jackson both appeared in the original film and the sequel and although the story isn't as strong as the first movie it does have its moments.

 The story deals with Quentin coming back to Collinwood with his bride Tracy and he starts to see ghosts and images of a witch he once knew. He realizes he once ""lived"" at Collinwood as someone else and that is where the story takes off.

 ""Night of Dark Shadows"" did make money at the North American box office, but fans felt it wasn't as interesting as the first film. This was due to the fact that over 35 minutes of film footage was cut at the last minute which resulted in continuity problems in story content.

 The DVD and BluRay versions of ""Night of Dark Shadows"" will hit stores in later in 2012 so look for that!

I'd love to see the lost footage, but as far I as recall the missing 20-some mins. were lost for years. The footage resurfaced some time ago without an audio track. Even without the missing parts, this is a fine example of early 70s supernatural thrillers. It stands toe to toe with the finest from Hammer or Amicus from the same period, or the DC line of horror comic books.

However, it disappoints many fans because all of the TV show cast do not appear. The cast in the film is wonderful. And it's great to see Grayson Hall as yet another character! The smaller cast makes this film tighter and more accessible to the new-comers and fans alike.

Honestly I think this film is the superior of the 2 Dark Shadows movies, but you're not going to find the continuation of the TV series (Barnabas' story is resolved at the end of the TV series), or even the first movie. It's a completely new tale featuring the witch, Angelique, Quintin Collins and his wife Daphne. But no Barnabas and no vampires. I'd love to see the movie and House of Dark Shadows on DVD!

What always impressed me about 'Night of Dark Shadows' was it's subtlety.  'House of Dark Shadows' was fast, loud and very ""in your face.""  'Night of Dark Shadows' is quiet in comparison -- the music is lush and softer, and the pace is quite relaxed at times.  However, what emerges is an underlying sense of dread which intensifies throughout the course of the film (similar to Dan Curtis' 'Burnt Offerings' from 1976).  This makes the shocks and scares even more jarring, and by the end of the film, the audience is left feeling bewitched, bothered and bewildered!
It's also important to mention David Selby, who turns in an excellent performance as Quentin Collins.  His moodswings and erratic behavior (sensitive one minute and vicious the next), leave us as confused as Kate Jackson's character is.

412962,4,6301971418,"In this, the second of two Dark Shadows movies spawned from the cult classic immortal TV series, storylines and character traits from the show are forgotten and a completely original story unravels.  Whereas the original, House of Dark Shadows, capitalized on the popularity of the character of Barnabas Collins, this movie showcases the characters of Quentin Collins and Angelique.  Unlike the original, this movie is NOT a vampire story, but rather a ghost story of mystery and intrigue.  The result is an eery haunting tale of betrayal, murder, reincarnation, and ghostly possession.
Note to all fans of Barnabas or vampires in general, Jonathan Frid is NO WHERE to be seen here, as he declined to appear in any more Dark Shadows movies due to his being typecast.  However, David Selby is back from the show as Quentin and gives a great performance.  The beautiful ladies Kate Jackson (Tracy Collins) and Lara Parker (Angelique) are also great here.  John Karlen and Nancy Barrett, fan favorites from the show, make appearances as well.  Its a great ensemble cast that Dark Shadows fans will love.

It is important to bear in mind though, that Dan Curtis was forced at the last minute by the studio to edit the film from over 2 hours to 90 minutes in just 24 hours' time.  Thus the rough cut film may be confusing, as several key scenes were forced out of the movie.  However, the film is currently being restored to its original director's cut and will be coming to DVD in a few years.  Till then, enjoy the film as it is.

Yes, I bought one and I liked it but I wish they would release the restored version of this film.  According to The Night of Dark Shadows Restoration Site, they have already found about 35 minutes of missing footage.  The rest appears to be lost forever.  There are a lot of really good horror movies that are still not available on video, yet there is so much poorly done stuff and stupid slasher stuff that is out there.  Truly a shame.",1020988800,4,758,4.295774647887324

412967,5,6301971418,"This movie is great in that early 70s horror(reincarnation,occult themes)way. Extremely well done,with tons of atmosphere and beautiful camerawork. The acting is top-notch and Dan Curtis is at his best. I also love that the film deviated from the series a lot,like DARK SHADOWS in the bizzaro world. There's familiar characters(Angelique,Quentin,Laura,a mention of Elizabeth Stoddard),but they're not like we all know from TV.Many fans hate this movie because of the terrible editing that took place shortly before release. I think this movie should be reexamined. What's here is a gothic classic.",997747200,9,597,5.571428571428571
412968,5,6301971418,"I'm actually quite suprised to see all the criticisms of this movie.  I feel obligated to briefly respond in its defense.  I've been going through a phase (for reasons unknown) where my wife and I are almost exclusively renting horror videos.  We saw this movie last night and I found it very scary and filled with a particular atmospheric that seems to only come from movies from the 60's and early 70's.  There's something dated about the style, but it is also classic.
In this genre my favorites would be: ""The Haunting"" (the original); ""The Legend of Hell House""; ""Burnt Offerings"" (starring Karen Black); ""Phantasm"" (albeit that's from 1978).  I supppose the common denominator is that they are all of the haunted house motif.  I mention these movies because I thought the ""Night of the Dark Shadows"" fit in with them quite well.  I do agree that the editing was a little rough, but I didn't find it to detract in any major way.  The atmosphere, however, was a very seductive and bizarre mix of gothic/mod sexuality and occult mysticism.  There wasn't a tremendous amount of explicit violence, but the overall vibe was heavy enough that I didn't want my two year-old daughter in the room while it was playing.  The music was effectively corresponding to the developments in the movie--I'd buy the avant-garde soundtrack in a heartbeat.  And, I agree that actress Lara Parker was enchanting. I'd like to find that painting of her which so captivated Kate Jackson's husband!  The rest of the cast was also excellent; I even overcame my prejudice against Kate Jackson for her later Charlie's Angels contribution as she was sweetness personified in this and very compelling.
Overall, I definitely got the ""buzz"" I was seeking from this and any ""horror"" movie. It's true supernatural macabre without any innocent explanations.  The feeling of the movie has stayed with me since I watched it 20 hours ago.  I will follow the recommendations of others and seek out the ""House of the Dark Shadows.""",997315200,44,1995,4.863905325443787
412969,4,6301971418,"I think what I loved about ""Night of Dark Shadows"" is to see some of the members of the classic tv show cast together for one last time.  I thought it was crazy of MGM demanding that Dan Curtis cut over 40 minutes of footage from this wonderful film.  ""Night of Dark Shadows"" has atmosphere, fantastic acting, and once it is fully restored, Dan Curtis vision of what the film should of been.  For ""Dark Shadows"" fans, I highly recommended this film.  I recommend this film in a way that I recommend ""Star Trek I"" and ""Star Trek V"" for ""Star Trek"" fans and ""Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me"" for fans of ""Twin Peaks.""",973036800,3,614,4.267241379310345

412971,4,6301971418,"In its current state, ""Night of Dark Shadows"" is a film which demands apologies from its fans. For anyone aware of its ludicrous 11th hour recutting and lost storyline, the knee-jerk response is to look upon it with pity, mumbling explanations and sympathy to any onlookers. For ""Dark Shadows"" fans, the film was initially an embarassment, a slipshod mess overlooked in favour of its less mutilated sibling ""House of Dark Shadows"": As the reasons for its incoherency became more commonly known, fans learned to enjoy it for what it might have been: Finally, with the publication of its complete scripts, they learned to apologise for it blindly, to such an extent that they often fail to acknowledge anything of value in the existing version, which is a great pity.
Sad and lopsided as it plays, shorn of a conclusion, with exposition torn away in jagged strips, ""Night of Dark Shadows"" astonishingly still contains a quality that begs to be enjoyed. Boasting a more polished production than the previous film, it seizes upon the first film's strengths in style and narrative, honing them for marriage with a far superior script and markedly more mature style. Whereas ""House of Dark Shadows"" replays as a succession of loud shouting set pieces, ""Night"" utlises its creative peaks to punctuate a highly charged and atmospheric narrative, which is eloquently conveyed throughout by the cast, dialogue and production.
Weaving deftly through classic literary achetypes and familiar ""Dark Shadows"" storylines, the script impresses throughout, with its wistful themes of eternal love and ghostly reincarnation, along with a deeply human side that inspires sympathy. Ironically, while shunning many of the traditional horror images of its predecessor, it manages to emerge as a deeply satisfying distillation of the gothic genre, though with a distinctly modern sense of plotting. Unlike the simplistic elemental notions of evil in ""House of Dark Shadows"", all the characters of ""Night"" firmly etched in shades of grey.
Seizing upon the television show's fondness for nightmare sequences, the film offers numerous dark tableaus, each cut down to starkly memorable images, uniquely memorable in their individual ways. The film also introduces sex to the world of ""Dark Shadows"", which may offend purists. However, it manages to treat these themes with a maturity which justifies their inclusion. In this Collinwood, rape and violence are equal evils to its supernatural forces.
The cast acquit themselves admirably throughout, with David Selby carrying the central role deftly. Grayson Hall's housekeeper Carlotta Drake excels through her restraint. Her lingering presence dominates each of her scenes, icy and peircing throughout. Lara Parker's statueque countenance compliments the ghostly Angelique perfectly, with a minimal approach making the most of her limited role.
Dan Curtis' direction is light-years away from the more juvenille approach displayed in ""House"". Presented with a script that resists overstatement, he uses a minimal approach which allows the actors to shine, composing the action in starkly poetic vignettes. Where the direction displayed in ""House"" is frequently frantic to the point of incoherency, ""Night"" is considered throughout, with every angle and cut appropriately chosen. This makes the fact that ""Night"" should have befallen such an aggressive re-cut especially tragic, as Sam Hall's script and Curtis' treatment lack any slack areas. Each line of dialogue within each scene actively works to advance the storyline and characters. Apparently incidental details such as Gerard laying bricks in an early scene foreshadow later developments, creating an organic storyline which is almost poetic in its development and resolution.
Wrapped up neatly with a satisfying twist that subverts the traditional gothic themes, ""Night of Dark Shadows"" remains an effective shocker even in partial form, with much to recommend. It is entirely adult in its mood, beautifully produced, and flawlessly executed. Even in a heavilly truncated form, ""Night of Dark Shadows"" does not fail to assert itself as the superior ""Dark Shadows"" film.",969580800,14,4149,5.4541213063763605

I haven't met anyone to date who doesn't despise her. She should have been forced out and gone on to her predestined career as a walmart cashier, not continued on to be one of Charlie's Angels.
