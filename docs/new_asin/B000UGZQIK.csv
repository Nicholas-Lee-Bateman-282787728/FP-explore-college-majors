8213243,1,B000UGZQIK,"The cast members are nothing more then walking,talking stereotypes like Jett and her vally girl accent ala Clover from Totally Spies,Bianca:A mean snob and a forerunner to Mandy also from Totally Spies,Radley:surfer dude,Tara and her Deep Southern accent,Gig:A rocker stereotype,Chester:The geek,Pierce:a egotistiacl,girl-crazy snob and so many more that I can't type them all. Worst of all,there is only one african american on the whole show and her name is Shanelle. She is the only character on the show I can stand. The jokes & episodes are cheesey & phoned in a mile away. FYI:What kind of parents would name their daughter,Larke? That's a kind of word that Pinky might say. The biggest plothole of the series is...WHERE ARE THE PARENTS? Are they so inattentive that they don't know what their kids are doing. Overall,this show is bland at best and shoves the 80's right in our faces again & again. I give this show a 1 out of 10.",1289865600,,936,4.8930817610062896
8213244,3,B000UGZQIK,"I wish they would release the whole series. A better collection for a teaser would've been a A-list animation crew episodes like: The Dog Ate My Homework, Fairytale Flakeout, A Time To Remember and Down and Out in the Teen Club :)",1274832000,5,230,4.5
8213245,4,B000UGZQIK,"The quality was decent, definitely took me back to my youth.  I was disappointed that there were only 4 episodes on the dvd, however.  I wish I had known that upfront.  I know the series wasn't on long at all, but there were definitely more than 4.",1246406400,11,248,4.23404255319149
8213246,2,B000UGZQIK,"Beware, this is a generic CD.  The quality is what you would get when you transfer a VHS movie to DVD.  There are 4 episodes.  Glad I didn't pay a lot.",1220313600,12,151,3.806451612903226
