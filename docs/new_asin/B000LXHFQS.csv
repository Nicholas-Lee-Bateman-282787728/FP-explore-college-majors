2716341,3,B000LXHFQS,I liked it,1439596800,,10,2.6666666666666665
2716342,5,B000LXHFQS,Love the cast!,1434153600,,14,4.0
2716343,5,B000LXHFQS,"Except for being a poor print,I'd class this film alongside Five Came Back anyday. Whale was great and the comedic touches are a hit. No Dwight Frye as listed,but a young Milburn Stone,of Gunsmoke fame,John Boles has a good starring role,as Madge Evans,Gene Lockhart a bit of comedy relief,along with the parrot.",1432684800,2,312,5.019230769230769
2716344,2,B000LXHFQS,"I guess I was expecting more, but by this late stage in Whale's career I suppose he directed whatever Universal Studios wanted him to (and that wasn't much).  First of all, the print that Alpha used is not the best (this remains unrestored), and the sound especially suffers. I probably missed half the dialog at points. Whatever. I could nevertheless perceive the contrived plot (even beyond the contrived scenario) and half-baked acting. This is a far cry from Showboat or Bride of Frankenstein, both made only a few years before.",1406678400,,532,4.911111111111111
2716345,4,B000LXHFQS,Not bad for a movie produced in the 30's. I would recommend this movie for an evening when there is nothing good on TV.,1405641600,,119,4.0
2716346,3,B000LXHFQS,Ok movie. Not something really to die for but an interesting period piece. Shallow at a number of points but not a bad movie to have on in the background.,1404259200,,154,4.166666666666667
2716347,5,B000LXHFQS,"""Sinners in Paradise"" is a good 30s adventure movie.  The plot is good and feasible and the acting is good.",1375401600,,107,4.35
2716348,4,B000LXHFQS,Sinners in Paradise was quite enjoyable. The print was damaged but it did not spoil the movie for me. It is no Gone With The Wind but it is a nice little film to watch during a rainy evening.,1356739200,5,191,3.923076923076923
2716349,1,B000LXHFQS,"I have ordered two copies of this dvd and neither had sound--silent movies!  Good luck--it looks like an interesting film, but I have not been able to watch it yet.",1235433600,,164,4.466666666666667
8164939,4,B000LXHFQS,"Good old fashioned plane survivor movie made better by the great James Whale. It's definitely a bottom line B level flick, no big stars and the script is pretty standard with a group of stereotypes winding up on an island after a plane crash. But the fun does come in seeing some of the stereotypes turned on their heads as people come to appreciate what they have while on the island. Whale wisely keeps the pace up and sprinkles the humor throughout without letting it get too broad. A pleasant rainy day flick.",1510358400,,513,4.526881720430108
8164940,4,B000LXHFQS,Great simple oldie but goodie,1507939200,,29,5.0
8164941,5,B000LXHFQS,"A very good old movie, the kind I grew up with, and than The Jungles of Vietnam and combat, death change me for ever.",1490313600,,117,3.9166666666666665
8164942,3,B000LXHFQS,It's Black & White Old Movie of B Level Acting.  Kind Slow & Boring for Me.,1489536000,,75,3.6875
8164943,5,B000LXHFQS,"This was a very good movie,had good story line and acting was good.",1486252800,,67,4.230769230769231
8164944,4,B000LXHFQS,"Really interesting pre-code movie! Kind of an uncensored Gilligan's Island! Loved the two leads! Also good acting by the supporting cast.
The ending left me hanging a bit. I'd rather have had it made clear how it would all resolve. They needed a part 2 to tie up what happens to everyone once they leave the island.",1481846400,,315,4.543859649122807
8164945,5,B000LXHFQS,Great B Movie. Fun to watch. Audio visual VERY good.,1467158400,,52,4.3
8164946,4,B000LXHFQS,"I enjoyed the movie just for a bit of diversion. Not a ""great"" movie, but a pleasant movie. Doesn't require any big thoughts or even much attention. Like someone else said, it's good for a rainy afternoon or in my case, the middle of the night.",1459728000,2,244,4.326086956521739
8164947,5,B000LXHFQS,my kind of movie,1456876800,,16,3.25
8164948,3,B000LXHFQS,"Good ensemble cast and balance of drama, romance and comedy.",1446681600,,60,5.1
