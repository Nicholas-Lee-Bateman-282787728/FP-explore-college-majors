3964129,5,B002P9NOI4,"Sheryl Crow has always been an inspiration to me.  She's such an incredible talent - and not only has she dealt with heartache in the public eye, but then we all saw her battle breast cancer and win.  It's great to see her talk about her experience on this DVD - and then when you add other megacelebrities like Melissa Etheride and Christina Applegate - plus a lineup of the world's best doctors - WOW.  Watching this was a great education on breast cancer but it was also so emotional and uplifting.",1261440000,,501,4.423913043478261
3964130,5,B002P9NOI4,"After watching the DVD, ""Breast Cancer: The Path of Wellness and Healing""...I have found a path to knowledge and understanding of this behemoth disease. I started watching this DVD with basic knowledge of breast cancer, two hours later I emerged an expert (well almost).  This DVD is packed with every conceivable question one might have regarding breast cancer.  Not only does it cover the conventional and western medical approach to the disease, it also covers complementary and alternative care.  Diet, vitamins, fitness, yoga, meditation, chemo, hormones, radiation, surgery........every aspect of dealing with breast cancer is covered in a comprehensive way.  This DVD presents so many of the top experts in so many fields.  The best news of all is that this DVD is completely ""watchable"".  Truly I loved every minute, which says a lot considering the subject matter.  The DVD is not only informative but it is inspiring.  It tracks the story of many women going through breast cancer.  They share their stories and their insight and their levity. I was deeply touched by the bravery and strength that these woman share with the audience.  We are all touched by Breast Cancer in some way,  If you are a woman, or a man,  you should buy this DVD,  not only will you learn ways to keep yourself healthy but you will help further the cause of finding a cure. All of the profit from this DVD go towards various breast cancer charities and research.",1257292800,,1450,4.89344262295082
3964131,5,B002P9NOI4,"A very close friend of mine is a breast cancer survivor and thriver. I've been with her every step of the way. When she was going through chemo we read the books, talked to a hundred doctors.  Everything was focused on the body - the physical body. And she was really blessed to find treatments that helped her heal.  But the thing that kept coming up in her support group, over and over, was the fact that treating the body is only HALF THE BATTLE.  This DVD was the first time someone addressed both sides of the coin and acknowledged that the emotional toll that cancer takes is just as difficult to deal with.  Hearing these doctors and stars say what I thought all along is really amazing.  I'm recommending it to all the women I know.",1254787200,5,740,4.372262773722627
3964132,5,B002P9NOI4,"This DVD is OUTSTANDING!  Three women in my family have been diagnosed with breast cancer, but I've always been really intimidated and overwhelmed by all the information out there.  Now that I'm in my early 40's I knew it was time to get educated but I never knew where to begin.  This was the solution.  It's a one stop shop and covers ALL the bases.",1254787200,2,351,4.3538461538461535
3964133,5,B002P9NOI4,"Seriously, WOW!  This is really well done.  Informative, interesting, moving, funny (am I allowed to say that about something related to cancer?), easy to watch and loaded with information.  Thank you so much for this contribution, it will help the women in our lives and millions all over the world!",1253664000,3,300,4.96

8376783,5,B002P9NOI4,"As someone who not only coaches cancer survivors and caregivers but who was also an award-winning documentary filmmaker before dedicating my professional life to helping those touched by cancer, I highly recommend this video.  It is one of the most comprehensive resources that touches in on every major aspect of the cancer experience in a way that informs and empowers the viewer.

The filmmaker, Nina Montee Karp, digs deep into the journey and unearths resources, information, inspiration and hope.  This is a film from the heart and the participants share from theirs honestly, with courage, humor, self-love and compassion.

When my late husband was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, as his caregiver I dug through hundreds of books, articles and websites to help us understand what we were facing, both medically and emotionally.  Though the film focuses on breast cancer, it will contribute to anyone on the journey to healing from cancer. I know it would have been a great resource for us.

Nina thoughtfully created a structure that starts at the beginning of the experience which allows survivors to either choose to watch and learn about the entire journey or take it ""chapter"" by chapter as their journey unfolds, one step at a time.  The film along with the additional sources DVD represents information that would take an individual thousands of hours to go through on their own.

I also love that Nina includes the caregivers.  As a teen, I became my mother's caregiver and just recently had the chance to share my story in the newly published essay, ""The Other Side of Pink"" available here on Amazon in the anthology, Tarnished: True Tales of Innocence Lost.  Caregivers can be the forgotten ones and have unique perspectives, concerns and stresses.  She doesn't let their stories overtake the main focus, but Nina does represent this often silent partner.  Doing so helps us recognize the importance of survivors having this kind of support.

If you only buy one resource to help you or your loved one through the experience of cancer, make it this one.",1309046400,,2071,5.002915451895044
8376784,5,B002P9NOI4,"It was outstanding, not only for those with cancer, but also for their spouses and families. I think it could be used for groups in churches.",1304726400,,141,4.461538461538462
8376785,5,B002P9NOI4,"I was diagnosed with early stage DCIS 4 years ago.  I decided to have a lumpectomy and had the sentinel nodes removed.  The pathology report was all clear but I did have to have 7 weeks of radiation therapy.

My sister-in-law was recently diagnosed with stage II or III breast cancer.  She was in her decision making process when I got the e-mail about the DVD.  We decided to get it and split the cost.  I watched it first and was so amazed about how much information was given in terms I could understand.  I think I was in a fog when I went through my experience and didn't ask too many questions; basically just doing whatever the doctors told me to do.

My sister-in-law opted for a bi-lateral radical mastectomy.  There were some cancer cells in the sentinel node so they removed all the nodes on one side.  She is recovering from her surgery and will be making some tough decisions in the next couple of weeks regarding chemotherapy and radiation.  I encouraged her to watch the DVD before any decisions were made because I really think it will make that process so much easier!!!

I think this DVD is good for anyone; whether they've had cancer or not.  Being educated BEFORE you have to go through something traumatic like breast cancer would have made me feel so much better with the decisions that had to be made!",1304553600,2,1324,4.489539748953975
8376786,5,B002P9NOI4,"Once my wife had been diagnosed with Breast Cancer we searched for as much information on the disease as we could find. We had so much to learn, and had so many questions. We bought, borrowed or were given a library of books, pamphlets, articles  and anecdotes about breast cancer . We sought to understand what we were facing, what was it like, what caused it, what were my wife's chances of survival, what to do next, etc.. There were so many new terms and definitions. It was scary to say the least. We spent a lot of time going to see doctors, therapists and alternative healers just to become informed. Had this DVD had been around when we started our journey, we could have saved so much precious time and eliminated unnecessary stress in a time filled with great fear. Never before has one source been so informative, so enlightening, and so accessible for the lay person as well as the professional. This DVD interviews, informs and educates from the very best of those who deal with Breast Cancer daily. Not only do they talk about the physiology of cancer, the types of treatment, the side-effects, the emotional effects, you'll also hear about the importance of things such as support groups for your care-giver. The Doctors interviewed here are eminent Oncologists, but there are also world renowned homeopaths, healers, and therapists.  There are interviews with celebrity breast cancer survivors speaking candidly about their journey, their despair, their frustration, and their hope. You will also hear testimonies from women who are just like you and your friends. You will learn that the sisterhood of breast cancer victims is one that is united regardless of age, race, or socio-economic background.  If you, or someone you love has Breast Cancer, this is the next best thing besides your love and support to give them. Knowledge is power, and this DVD is Knowledge.",1290124800,,1884,4.88125
