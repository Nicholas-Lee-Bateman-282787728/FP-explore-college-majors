5186811,5,B008WAM314,Got this for my cousin for her birthday and of course she loved the novela. She loved having it on DVD!,1358294400,,103,3.9523809523809526
5186812,4,B008WAM314,I really loved this novela and bought the dvd I liked it only thing is they left out some top scenes,1357948800,,100,3.8095238095238093
5186813,3,B008WAM314,"I loved it. But it was NOT the complete novela. it was only about Ana Paula, Rogelio, Gustavo, and Rogelio sister. Nothing or nobody else. they skipped all the other parts that did not include main characters . I liked all of the novela while on T.V. not just part of it. Disapointed. :(",1354665600,,287,4.333333333333333
5186814,4,B008WAM314,"Estoy Super Ansioso por Tener esta Telenovela En Dvd. Me Encanta!!! No veo la hora de que llegue el da de que salga a la Venta para Comprarla.
La verdad que es una Exelente Historia, con un Gran Elenco, muy bien ambientada y con Locaciones Realmente Hermosas.
Una de las Mejores Producciones de Televisa en los Ultimos Tiempos, sin duda...
Me Muero de Ganas de volver ver muchas Escenas, de ver la Entrada con el Tema Principal de Reyli, Te Dejare de Amar y el de Jessy & Joy Corre en varias Escenas de Amor....
Review: Me Gusto Mucho el DVD. Tuve la oportunidad de Comprar la Edicin Mexicana que sali en el Mes de Septiembre, la Ordene en una Tienda de Mxico y me llego a los 3 dias.
Me Gusto el Resumen aunque le faltan algunas Escenas como la Muerte de David/Jorge Aravena, solo se ve hasta que se pelea con Rogelio en la Hacienda, no esta su muerte. Una cosa que si me hubiera gustado muchisimo volver a ver son las Escenas en que Rogelio y Ana Paula se van de luna de miel, no estan en el Resumen, las quitaron. Me hubiese encantado verlas de nuevo, Son Mis Escenas Favoritas, los Paisajes y Locaciones Fueron Hermoso/as.
En General la Edicion Es Muy Buena, excepto algunos detalles que no estan como cuando golpen a Gustavo, cuando Cinthia se entera que Maria es su madre, cuando Bruno le dice a Gustavo que Rogelio le pago a David para que Miguel quedara como responsable del accidente que tuvo con en el camion de la hacienda y la Pelea de Ana Paula con Cinthia cuando le reclama por haberle puesto la vibora en el cuarto, que causo la muerte de su hijo. Tambien hubiera querido que dejaran algunas de las escenas de Marco Mendez/Esteban ya que tenia relacion con el personaje de Mar Contreras/Vanesa, no se ve practicamente. Sin ser eso lo demas esta muy bien.
La Musicalizacion es perfecta, tiene el Tema Principal de Reyli, Te Dejare de Amar y En Todas las Escenas de Amor de Ana Paula y Rogelio sale el Tema de Jesse & Joe Corre jeje.
De 0 a 10 le doy un 7 al DVD, por la Telenovela que Es Exelente, por el Gran Elenco que tiene, por la Historia, y Sobretodo por la Pareja de Ana Paula y Rogelio, porque ME ENCANTAN!!!
Disfrute Muchisimo de este DVD!!! ME ENCANTO!!!
Comprenlo, no se van a arrepentir!!!",1346284800,3,2215,4.378640776699029

5186846,1,B008WAM314,"I bought this DVD because I started to watch the story on TV but couldn't finish it in time, well to my surprise to find alot of content missing from this dvd.  The whole point of buying this is to see the whole story but instead all you get is a chopped up version of the story. Alot of key scenes are missing (some which the characters mention but are missing out of this dvd) this is the last time I ever buy a Novela on dvd.",1455580800,2,428,3.9195402298850577

I can't believe that there are still original stories after having seen about a dozen telenovelas.  Great story, actors, soundtrack, and scenery.

Highly recommended!",1400716800,,300,5.081632653061225

5186902,5,B008WAM314,This Telenovela is awesome. The characters are well played. And I was so glad her true love wasn't the topical first love that most novelas have.,1396483200,,145,4.615384615384615

5186905,5,B008WAM314,"This is an edited version, of course, but it is relatively well done.  There are two or three points where there is something in a scene that refers back to something which has been edited out, but they are relatively minor.  I will say (because I wanted to know HOW edited it was and no reviews told me) that although no major story lines have been omitted, the editing makes the main plot a tad more trivial-seeming...Rogelio and Paola seem to break up in every third scene and the relationship between Gustavo and Ana seems extremely trivial and juvenile.  I still love it because I liked the series a lot!",1382400000,,609,4.5181818181818185

5186907,5,B008WAM314,"This novela is the best novela I have seen in years! I honestly gave up watching novelas for a long time because I felt that most of them were all the same until I came across LQNPA. The actors, the story, and the scrip are fantastic! I love Ana Brenda and Jorge Salinas as a couple. These two have crazy chemistry together! I definitely recommend this telenovela to anyone that enjoys real good actors and a great story!",1380672000,,421,4.410256410256411

5186944,4,B008WAM314,"Love this soap operat, however, they take out too many parts that are important; for example when they assaulted Gustabo, the accident of Miguel, which trigger all the rest of the soap opera...........",1378857600,,201,5.121212121212121
5186945,5,B008WAM314,"La Que no Podia Amar (The Love He Couldn't Have - 887 minutes)

This better-than-average outing features Jorge Salinas as Rogelio Montero, a wealthy, crippled curmudgeon who runs his hacienda with an iron fist and an overworked riding crop (he wears a Stetson).

He sees a nursing student, Ana Paula Carmona, played by Ana Brenda Contreras, and takes a shine to her because she resembles the lovely woman who broke their engagement when he became crippled. Ana Paula and her brother Miguel live with their conniving tia, Aunt Rosario, who uses every ploy in the book to use her niece's beauty for her own financial gain.

Even though Ana Paula falls in love with Gustavo Duran, played by Jos Ron, various ploys convince her he has been killed, so she accepts a contract to live with the curmudgeon for a year, doing physical therapy on his crippled legs and posing as his wife. He likes her defiance and appreciates it when she stands up to him.

His sister, Cynthia, seems to be very, very flaky, but as the story progresses, we come to realize that she is insane. Nothing is ever her fault, she always puts the blame on someone else and sincerely believes it! She is played to villainous perfection by Susana Gonzlez, who takes insanity to a believable level. Watch the scene where her husband is leaving her; it is one of the all-time great exhibitions of terrific acting!

Meanwhile, Vanessa, the lovely young woman who jilted our curmudgeon when he was hurt, comes back to try for a reconciliation because her father needs a major contract renewed.

We see many rounds of ""Who's Your Daddy?"" and misunderstandings derail our lovers over and over. There are people to admire and people to loathe. All in all, a good telenovela that hits all its marks! I got mine from Amazon",1375401600,,1778,4.70096463022508

The soap opera was done with so much feeling and emotion that while watching the dvds you feel like you are truly living the story of the characters.  The actors do a wonderful job in the soap opera and everything is beautifully done.  The characters, the setting, the plot-everything is so lovely.
