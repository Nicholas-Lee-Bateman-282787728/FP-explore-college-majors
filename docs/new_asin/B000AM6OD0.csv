If you are a fan of low budget gore/gross-out flicks, this will make a decent addition to your collection, and looks real good with the similar Blood Bank set.",1493683200,,267,4.469387755102041

8078866,4,B000AM6OD0,"This set is full of terrible movies.  However, that is what it's supposed to be.  Its supposed to be a boxset full of craptastic movies and is intended for people who love bad movies such as me.  You know what your buying when you buy it so I don't see why there is such negetive reviews of this boxset.  CROAKED: FROG MONSTER FROM HELL is about frog people killing people in order to protect their gold.  CURSE OF THE CANNIBAL CONFEDERATES is about confederates who where tortured to death by union soldiers that rise from the dead to kill a couple of campers.  DEAD DUDES IN THE HOUSE is about an old lady that comes back from the dead to kill the people inside the house she onced lived in. This is actually a pretty good horror film and if you love underrated horror films and decide not to buy this set, you should still check this one out.  DEADLY DAPHNIE'S REVENGE is about a girl that was rapped and decides to take him to court.  Daphnie is a random black girl that comes out of nowhere and randomly kills the rappist at the end of the film.  DEMENTED DEATH FARM MASSACRE a film about jewl theives who hold some rednecks hostage and one of the rednecks fight back. FERTILIZE THE BLASPHEMING BOMBSHELL is a movie where a girl searches for her sister who was killed by satan worshipers.  THE NEWLYDEADS is amovie where a cross dresser comes back from the dead to kill people.  SPACE ZOMBIE BINGO is about half robot alien zombies that invade Earth.  STUFF STEPHANIE IN THE INCINERATOR is about a group of rich people that play a game where they pretend to kill and steal from each other.  VIDEO DEMONS DO PSYCHOTOWN is about a group of film students that try to make a documentary about a town where everyone is a phychic and it turns out that one of the students is psychic so the rest of the psychic try to get ride of her so she doesn't discover their dark secret.",1392249600,,1874,4.350574712643678
8078867,2,B000AM6OD0,"you are honestly better off getting the toxie triple terror box sets out there and get the other movies that were packaged with it too. the movies are not all bad. i have personally owned the box sets mentioned and the unincluded movies are good too. i suggest getting the other box sets other than this for not only price but also other good troma movie releases.
my 2 stars are not for the movies themselves but this pack itself as a bum deal.",1216080000,3,445,4.309523809523809
8078868,2,B000AM6OD0,"The scariest thing about TOXIE'S TOP TEN is the eerily similar comments that most of these screamfests have gotten from viewers. Universal disappointment, derision and disapproval is expressed by them in such unequivocal terms as: ""avoid at all costs,"" ""the worst movie of all time"" and ""pure crap."" With such liabilities as cheezy costuming, crummy music, bad acting and improvised scripts, what else can the 'Z' grade gore film fan expect?

Let's see what we gots here-- Two films about crazed crossdressers, psychic psychos, cults, a rubber froggie suit, zombies, homicidal Reb soldier-ghosts and other ""dead back to life"" plots (for lack of a better word) and BLOOD-- lots of it, looking fakey as all get out. Some of the prime frumunda here dates back to the mid-70s-- yes, really AWFUL movies were made even back then. Caveat emptor on this cadaverous collection.

One way or another, these 10 movies will have you screaming.
