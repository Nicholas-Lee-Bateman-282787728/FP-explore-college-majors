7854715,2,6303823327,lloyd a. simandl directed this not so action packed film starring shannon whirry and ciara hunter. you got two very sexy actresses but not alot of action. robin kane(whirry) is a women who gets trapped in an institute that trains assassins.once her trainng begins she descovers that some of her fellow trainees are being murdered by the heads of the institute using a computer generated torture device. robin then befriends one of the trainees(hunter) and the two of them attempt to escape. this movie is really only good for drooling over whirry and hunter(who was miss canada in 1988 and made her starring debut here). the movie lacks both excitement and suspense. if you really want to see it then id say rent it or borrow it.,974160000,14,729,4.748031496062992
