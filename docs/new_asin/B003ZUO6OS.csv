4235577,1,B003ZUO6OS,"This is intended only as a means to inform you of an unfortunate, incorrect product display concerning this particular Blu ray release.
Unfortunately, even though this title is listed as being ""region-free"" in terms of coding, it is not. Review of the specific title pictured is in fact coded for region-B specifically (which includes Europe, Africa but none of the Americas.) Further information confirms that no current (as of 06/22/2012) ""region-free"" version of this release exists.

  The good news is, there is a region-A version of this release available for purchase from multiple online vendors (a quick google search will help there!) This is not meant to tarnish or demean the value of shopping with Amazon.com, it is merely stated for those who truly would like to own a version of this release they can watch on their region-A coded players. Additional information of this region-A version is that it is Chinese language with English subtitles, there is no English dubbing. The distiction between the two versions is in the unique cover art; The current displayed art is for the region-B version, and the region-A version shows the titular character on horseback with other lead characters and massive armies on the front cover.

  So, if you already have a region-B player, then you are all set in terms of this title. As I stated this review is only to clarify that this is not a region-free version. I have heard there are ""chips"" or firmware that may be installed in blu ray players to allow them to play any region coded Blu ray (the ever popular google search can assist with that!), but that involves tampering with the player which usually voids the warranty (if applicable.) So, hopefully this is helpful to anyone wanting to own this blu ray release. A quick note on the actual film itself - This is a more mature movie based on the Chinese folk tale, this is not the ""Disney Mulan"" you may have seen.",1340323200,66,1924,4.7975830815709966
4235578,5,B003ZUO6OS,"This is absolutely the best presentation of a well known story.  The adaptation is very good, and the acting is first rate, especially that of Vicki Zhao(Mulan).  The battle scenes are some of the best-staged in recent Chinese movies.  In the equestrian scenes in particular, the horses run straight, their heads are not yanked around like a marlin trying to shake off its hook and the riders sit properly instead of bouncing around with their arms flapping like the wings of a bird trying to take off.  The entire cast is to be congratulated and I highly recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in Chinese legends.  Beware though, that although the English subtitle is reasonably accurate, there is no way to turn it off!  This may be a distraction to some viewers.",1323129600,53,777,4.7611940298507465
4235579,5,B003ZUO6OS,"I saw this movie shortly after it came out in Chinese only, so I do not know about the translation. However, the characters, plot and special effects are all wonderful.

4235580,4,B003ZUO6OS,"Hua Mulan, the latest take on the Mulan legend, finally gives the subject the treatment it deserves.  It's a gritty, stark film that chronicles the well known story of a woman who defies both convention and the law by disguising herself as a man to fight in the campaign against the Rouran Confederation, an earlier version of the classic Mongolian raiders.

Not much is known about the Mulan fable other than the basics.  Here it opens in the Rouran camp as Mendu (Hu Jun), son of the Danyou- leader of the tribes- is executing prisoners instead of releasing them as his father wished.  The looming presence of the Rouran forces a nationwide conscription to repel the invaders.  Already a veteran, Mulan's ailing father is called to serve again, but she steals his armor and sword and reports in his place.  She meets new comrades as well as reuniting with a friend from her village, Tiger (Jaycee Chan), who agrees to help her.  She also befriends Wentai (Chen Kun) a lieutenant in their unit who also uncovers her secret but agrees to maintain the deception, seeing no real value in outing her.  When the Rourans invade their camp Mulan distinguishes herself; with the commander killed in the battle she and Wentai earn promotions.  They achieve an impressive record, fueling some jealousy among their superiors.  As the war continues and many of her friends fall, Mulan tires of it all and admits her feelings for Wentai, who though he feels the same, is forced to teach her some severe lessons about what it means be in command as well as the dangers of having personal attachments during war.  In response to Mulan's string of victories Mendu seizes control of the Rouran tribes from his father and pushes north.  A war council forms a plan to bait the Rouran into a canyon to destroy them and Mulan volunteers to draw them in. This confrontation leads to developments that will affect the course of the war and change the lives of the survivors in unforeseen ways, even as it draws their destinies together.

The strongest part of the movie is script.  It's engaging with lots of little touches, rooted in themes of love, honor, loyalty and patriotism- starting with her father's desire to serve beyond his capabilities and the love and respect for him that drives Mulan.  Even the idea that a woman could serve in the military for twelve years, rising to the rank of a senior commanding officer and no one noticing anything gets a little of this treatment.  You get the impression the troops know but she's long since earned their respect and admiration.  The most sentimental moments are a recurring ideal of the stars as spirits looking down upon their loved ones.  Unfortunately all the good stuff is saved for Mulan and the fellas; the Rouran characters are all second-stringers, though Mendu has a couple of good lines.

Zhao Wei as Mulan demands your attention and not because she's the star of the movie.  She has a great dramatic presence and portrays Mulan's personal struggles and conflicts with conviction through her expressions and small gestures- in short, good acting.  From the horror of her first kill to wondering about the reasons why they fight, Mulan is a person questioning herself and searching for answers... and like anyone else doesn't always receive them well.  Her best scene comes when a soldier's jade pendant goes missing and his uncle, the commander, orders everyone strip-searched to find it.  The tension plays out well and as she's forced to make a decision her eyes and facial expressions say it all.  Many of the more dramatic scenes evolve this way, and no one in the cast is ashamed to shed a few tears to show how much they care.  Jaycee Chan- Jackie's son- is a standout in his supporting role, with some truly poignant moments in the desert sequence.

Another strength of the film lies in its production.  The cinematography plays up the contrast between the slight dullness of the colors in military life to the crisper tones and gleaming trinkets under the high sun for the Rouran nomads as well as the bleakness of the desert before and after a devastating sandstorm.  Like all sweeping dramas the pacing gets a little slow sometimes, but the editing is excellent.  Fadeout transitions occur at just the right moments and like with all well-told stories, you understand what's happening without having it all spelled out for you- something Hollywood studios should keep in mind.  Though the film sort of rushes through its final scenes, you won't feel too cheated by it.  Even the soundtrack works- it's evocative, moody and boosts the melodrama even higher.

Hua Mulan is a well-crafted, well-acted film that's absolutely worthy of your time and attention.  And being so reasonably priced on dvd and blu-ray there's no reason not to give it.",1299369600,3,4795,4.822738386308068

4235583,5,B003ZUO6OS,"My wife and I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I was not aware before that there was actually a folk tale basis for the cartoon movie so this ws very educational.  Sorry that not suitable for my young granddaughters because of the violence but this is unavoidable given the subject.  The only thing that didn't ring true for me was how so many others did not realize that she was female.  Perhaps the real Mulan, if there really was one, was a less attractive gal.",1500595200,,468,4.470588235294118
4235584,5,B003ZUO6OS,"Comparison with the Disney version:
This IS the story of Mulan.  The Disney adaptation is a good story but not the story of the true Mulan.  The Disney story echoes more to the struggle of many modern Chinese Americans, trying to define themselves between their parents' expectations and their own.  I can understand that's what makes it a popular movie in the 90s.
However, Mulan is from 1600 years ago, when Chinese' culture attitude towards women was more open than the usual China most Westerners have known from recent 300~400 years.  In the original literature, there was no struggle to be a good girl.  A man/ marriage was irrelevant and not important in the original story at all.  She fulfilled her ambitions to be the best daughter and to serve her country to the highest level that most men couldn't match.
This Chinese Adaptation:
It is hard to make a movie for this story without a male interest and more personal struggles.  I think the team did a great job.  Instead of Hollywood relationships, the male interest/ prince support Mulan on her way to become the general she is.  In the end, they put aside their personal relationship for their country.
Even the Han princess did the same thing.  She did all the typical things princesses do in history, staging her half brother's murder and marrying herself off to faraway China so that her people wouldn't suffer wars any more.  All three sacrifices for the greater good, to end the war, which is this huge, great pressure, dusty theme covering the whole movie.
Now is it a movie for children?
Maybe not for preschoolers due to the graphic battle scenes.  But I would say, if your child can watch a superhero film such as Wonder Woman, she probably can watch this with some help.  These are real people trying to do superhero jobs.  There is a real princess, not Mulan, in it.  There is a real prince with lots of personal struggles in it.  There is a little girl that goes from just wanting to protect people to a real general, that she would have to ask people to die.",1499731200,2,2034,4.608333333333333

Though the movie is graphic (violence/blood), it would be okay for older kids who've outgrown the cartoon version of Mulan. My youngest is thirteen and she was okay watching this, though parents may need to explain a few things to help them understand what's going on.

4235608,5,B003ZUO6OS,"This movie was just amazing and I love this version of Mulan than the Disney version. This movie shows more on how war affects everyone including Mulan and other supporting characters. This movie was also able to show character development and a little romance but with a bittersweet ending. If you guys want a more happier ending than the Disney version of Mulan is better, but if your someone who can handle how real war affects people than this movie the one.

The next part is a spoiler alert so be warned.

The best part of the movie was that Mulan's character and how strong she is (not just physically but mentally.) I mean she was able to go to war for her father and take his place and then became a soldier and than became a general and still survive. However what made her strong was she was able to give up the only man she loved by preventing the war.",1471392000,5,864,4.327160493827161

4235626,5,B003ZUO6OS,"The battle scenes are chilling, brutal and personal. Zhao Wei did a wonderful job making the legend flesh and blood. It took a delicate hand to endear the audience to this character without diminishing or minimizing how incredible Mulan's military strategy and leadership was with dalliances.

 The story is wonderful and rings true to the original legend. So many war movies fall short where this one succeeded beautifully- rarely as a viewer do you see legendary leaders (known for inspiring) played with such charisma and raw power that you can experience firsthand the inspiration and fire lit inside yourself as you watch, even more rare when they are women; We need more stories like this.
The character of Mulan is written in a believable way that shows emotional growth and true (not stylized) perseverance through hardship. The plot doesn't rely on the common tropes such as the 'strong' woman trope or the hyper sexualized empowerment trope to carry the story and it's very fulfilling to watch. I wish I had seen this as a young person.

Kudos to Jingle Ma, Zhao Wei and team.",1453680000,3,1086,4.891304347826087

4235674,5,B003ZUO6OS,"Thanks to Disney, I was introduced to the legendary Chinese female general Mulan whose story every school kid in China is very familiar with. In digging deeper into the Mulan story, I realized that there was more to Mulan than the Disney version depicts.  Not surprising.  The Mulan of Chinese legend was a clever tactician trained in the Art of War.  This movie is not your Disney version.  This is a live action flick with actors who can act.  The movie is an epic largely because the actual story or legend behind it is.  I think the producers tried very hard to bring to the big screen the true warrior story of Mulan and they succeed for the most part.  Unfortunately, after having viewed the International Version of Red Cliff, it is hard to view any other Chinese historical movie without comparing it to that truly epic movie.  This Mulan movie makes a good effort at trying to capture the depth of Red Cliff.  I'm just sorry that the movie could not explore Mulan's brilliance as a battle tactician more, but what can you do when you only have 2 hours to present your cinematic story. [Red Cliff had 4 hours to develop its storyline and characters.] If you like costume dramas with some actual historical basis, you will be entertained by this one.",1411689600,16,1257,4.575892857142857

I wanted to see a more sophisticated/mature version and that's what I got. I personally would have liked it more if I got an English subbed version rather than dubbed, but I believe that I'm a minority in that aspect.

Other than the obvious casting question of using one of the most beautiful actresses to be Mulan (which would not be logical realistically), I really enjoyed the acting, the story line, the costumes, the fighting, and the special effects. The major characters were eye-candy, the story line seems to keep well to the ancient poem, adding a few flurries here and there, and the fighting is spectacular. I do question, however, the fighting style of her troops... reminds me too much of the Spartans. :D The costumes were pleasing, and seems authentic to its time period.

4235718,4,B003ZUO6OS,"The story of this movie is set in 5th century AD China, the Northern Wei dynasty. China had previously entered a dark age in the 3rd century, losing 85-90% of its population in years of civil wars. After a brief reunification under the Jin dynasty, the empire collapsed again, this time completely. All sorts of barbarians from the northern steppe and the western highland invaded China proper and set up their own little kingdoms. The remainder of the old imperial forces retreated to the southern bank of Yanzi River. Thus began a period known as the South/North Dynasties. Eventually, one northern kingdom conquered all the others. This was the Northern Wei. Although the Wei aristocracy originally came from modern-day Mongolia, it quickly sinicized and adopted the Chinese culture, language and clothing. Its sister tribe, the Avars, however, stayed behind and dominated the steppe.

Mulan is a true figure from the Wei period, and I am glad to see that this movie respects the historical facts. The Wei adopted Chinese agricultural economy but kept its old militant administrative structure, dividing the population into farmer vs soldier households. Mulan was born into one of the latter. As a single child, she was the only one in her family able to answer military service calls in her father's place. After Wei and the Avars consolidated their respective territories, they came into direct and continuous conflict for the next hundred years. It was under this background that Mulan entered the military and later the history book.

History does not provide much details, however, on the 12 years of her service, and this movie fills in the blanks. The battle scenes are frequent and nicely staged. The fighting and costumes are reasonably realistic. Much melodrama was introduced with a love interest for Mulan. I am too old to enjoy this part, but perhaps other viewers will like it better.

Overall, a decent production. I particularly like all the historically inspired details, including a political marriage that led to a ceasefire between Wei and Avars. I hope you will enjoy it too.",1382486400,28,2099,5.0606936416184976

My wife is Chinese and I made the mistake of watching the Disney version with my wife and she couldn't stand it as it's a children's movie.  I bought this for her.  She definitely liked this one better and enjoyed it.  Looks great in Blu-ray.  The Blu-ray version is in Mandarin only.  The dubbed English version is in regular DVD.  Cinematography is very good.

4235722,2,B003ZUO6OS,"Do you remember Disney's forgotten princess? Which one? There have been a few I suppose. I am talking about Mulan, the princess who could fight. Do you remember her? I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't, for Disney has. I knew I couldn't avoid Disney with two daughters, so I tired to steer them towards the better examples the corporate giant has produced. I deemed Mulan one of these, but we always had trouble finding Mulan toys, clothes, or other things. In the end, like every other America girl, they liked the blonde, white princesses. However, they have gotten older and one of them is learning Karate, so when Mulan: Rise of a Warrior came out I was excited that I might be able to give them an example of a woman warrior more real to life then the Disney version. I was wrong.

 If you have see the animated Mulan then you have the gist of the tale. Young girl wants to save her father from military service so she steals his gear and disguises herself as a man and enlists. She serves with honor, gains recognition, becomes a hero and so forth. This version differs somewhat in some small things. For one, Hua Mulan, played by Zhao Wei, has a friend from her village who knows her secret, Tiger, played by Jaycee Chan. Jaycee is Jackie Chan's son and he is proving to be a better actor then his father. Shortly after getting settled into the army's camp, Mulan is discovered by a commanding officer, Wentai, played by Chen Kun. They quickly develop feelings for each other. Between the two of them they support Mulan and help her advance in rank throughout her career. A career spent fighting the Rouran peoples who are trying to invade the Northern Wei Kingdom.

 This film could've been big. It could've been moving and educational and perhaps enlightening. However, I fear that Mulan doesn't hold as much cultural value as Confucius does, so the people behind this film didn't take the time or put in the work they should've to make this the success it could've been. I wonder if Mulan being a woman had anything to do with that? The film moved too fast, some scenes were only a handful of seconds, some under ten. It takes you through her early career and friendships with such speed you don't learn anything about these people. The only proof that they are important to Mulan is how she reacts when they die. So, when the film shows them dying dramatically and Mulan profoundly effected, you just can't believe it. There is no bridge for the gap between their introduction and death. You are not given a reason to care about any of these people, not even those closest to her, like Tiger and Wentai. The film does slow down by the end and provides what would be a great ending if the beginning was to have matched it. However, the ending is hallow considering the loose plot it was built upon.

 Despite the choppy, poorly written script the actors do a fair job. Zhao Wei does well with her emotional scenes of loss. Even if there is no connection established for the viewer to become emotional invested, you can still praise Zhao. She also does well with the action, which shouldn't surprise anyone, considering her past films. The large battle scenes are one of the few highlights, if you are an optimist. However, as a viewer, the same lack of emotional establishment exists for these scenes as the scenes of lost friends and love scenes. So, they would be great battle scenes if you were given a reason to care.

 The enemies are not as impressive as Disney's Shan Yu is, but they are more accurate. The Rouran are one in a long line of nomadic horse cultures that raided into southern China and were always fought off or bribed off. Most of the movie looks to be filmed somewhere along the Hexi Corridor, a thin bit of land which historical connected China to the Silk Road. Chinese rulers had to fight for control over that piece of land many times, as well as keep invaders from using it. Jun Hu plays the main villain, Modu. Normally a good actor, his performance in this film was a let down. I don't blame him, after all, he only had so much to work with.

 I am also upset with how Mulan is portrayed. She is never made to seem that strong. Sure, she kicks and punches and kills, but won't look people in the eye, cries a lot, and is never sure of herself. Unless, of course, Tiger or Wentai is there to comfort and advise her. For a young woman who runs off to join the military knowing if she is discovered she will be killed, raped or worse, she would've been a hell of a lot more self-confident, or at least more brazen. She would have more steel in her own will and not find it in her male friends so often. I am not suggesting that she can't have friends, but really, Mulan couldn't have been that weak willed as she is portrayed here.

 In all I found this movie lacking in so many aspects. They failed to make a connection worthy of being emotional over. They failed to pace the film. They clouded a good story with battle scenes that looked more like a chance for the Theatrical Division of the PLA to play dress up. They squandered the talents of many good artists on a script which shouldn't have even been considered as a first draft. They lost an opportunity to tell an amazing story of an amazing woman, raising the bar on how the world views women in general as well as in history. This film is a bitter disappoint. In conclusion, I am not saying Disney's Mulan is better, I am saying both versions aren't worth much. We will all have to wait to have the story of Hua Mulan told with patience and respect.",1380326400,7,5548,4.439096267190569
4235723,4,B003ZUO6OS,"I first saw this at an Animation festival in San Jose, CA about 2 yrs ago - I loved the live action version of Mulan, and found myself wrapped up in the characters' lives as everyone headed for war.

The young woman, disguised as a man to represent her father's name was wonderful - she felt she could fight just as man, given her training by her father; however, when faced with having to actually kill an enemy and lead the other soldiers forward to many battles, you could see the turmoil in her face - and later how tired she was of fighting and wanted to just go home to her family (like everyone else in her squad)

The love interest was kept at a distance (which I appreciated); and unfortunately could not continue at the end.  That's the thing about most Asian film, there's never a truly happy ending for everyone - which is refreshing compared to all the God-awful Hollywood/Disney movies that end with a song and dance and a parade.",1377993600,7,944,4.413793103448276
4235724,4,B003ZUO6OS,"Mulan, similar to the Disney adaption, is a story about a girl in ancient China, whom, because she didn't want her father to sacrifice his life being drafted into the Chinese imperial army, took his place in secrecy instead.
The story itself is a very noble and thought-provoking, with decent acting by the main lead, Zhao Wei.
But she is a product of the ""find a pretty girl, then teach her how to act"" school of Hong Kong cinema.
I first saw her in another Hong Kong blockbuster,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duel/dp/B00005B6LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duel</a>, which was the typical Hong Kong all-in-one movie of action, comedy, romance blockbuster back in the glory days. In that, she plays a young, naive princess, which befitted her more comedic charms.
In Mulan, she is forced to play a very serious and somber role, and her lack of acting chops shows.
If you have never seen an actual movie about Mulan, then this might be the best you can get to understand it.
But in the end, this movie suffers from the ""blockbuster"" effect of being overly grandiose and missing out on putting a message in our heads and make us think or feel.",1377648000,6,1194,5.065989847715736

The sadness to watch brothers die one by one and the pain from the wound of battles were hard to bear. The un-spoken love between two generals, mulan and wentai, were very touching. Mulan went to war because her father was sick and even though she was the only female in the army, she was an excellent warrior in terms of battling skills. The most horrible part for Mulan to be in the army was what if people found out she was a female but she got along well with these brothers in the army.  Even after she won the war and returned back home, there was no promise from Wentai to be together for the rest of her life because Wentai was a prince and he was obligated to marry a princess from enemy.

[SPOILERS BELOW]
Throughout the movie, I felt that Mulan's love interest was really quite unnecessary and that he served no purpose.  However, with the plot twist at the end where he reveals his bloodline seems to necessitate this part of the story.  Finally, the sacrifice that the both of them make solidifies it.  My wife thought the movie was too sad, but I found it quite good.  A different twist on a classic tale, I think they did quite well with it.",1356912000,2,678,4.299212598425197
