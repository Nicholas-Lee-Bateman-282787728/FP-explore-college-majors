6087150,2,B00GMM11VM,"A typical cops and drug dealer, revenge seeking, low quality in every way,  shoot'um up. No cleaver storyline or interesting angles ... quite boring.",1395964800,,149,5.208333333333333
6087151,5,B00GMM11VM,"This is the US distributor cut. The directors cut is out there as well, and is a completely different movie. I would check it!",1394323200,3,126,4.291666666666667
6087152,3,B00GMM11VM,"Frank 'Bullet' Marasco (Danny Trejo) is an LA detective. When he is not at work he likes to cage fight, go to Narcotics Anonymous, and take long walks in the park with his grandson (Kyle Villalovos). In order to prevent the execution of his son ( Eric Etebari) crime boss Carlito Kane (Jonathan Banks) who doesn't know about sun block, kidnaps the governor's daughter (Seri DeYoung) and Bullet's grandson. Frank goes on a rescue mission.

I love Danny Trejo,films and it was nice to see him in a movie longer than two minutes. But let's face it. This was a bad script, with cliche filled stupidity and not in a good way. They made the lawyer (Julia Dietze) idiotic. There was a ridiculous cheap special effects blood splatter scene involving a golf club. The daughter (Tinsel Korey) ex-drug addict thing didn't work well with the rest of the film. The attempt to build Frank's character felt forced.

Possible rental worthy for Trejo fans.

Parental Guide: f-bombs. No sex. Nudity (Julia Dietze)",1394236800,,995,4.807017543859649
6087153,4,B00GMM11VM,"I really liked this movie, but I must also qualify the 4-Star rating I gave it, just to be fair to all viewers. You must be a Danny Trejo fan to enjoy the action plot with flying bullets and squirting blood from wounds. Danny is Danny, mean-looking bulldog face, few words, irrational macho determination to take on loads of opponents at the same time, and a happy trigger finger. But if you are a normal movie-viewer who's looking for ""quality"" action, realistic plot, and great acting, then this movie is not for you, for under those criteria this movie would get 1-star rating from me. Danny is Frank ""Bullet"" Marasco, an L.A. detective whose grandson has been kidnapped by a drug cartel which is making big demands for his release. Well, you know Danny Trejo, he fears nothing, so he goes after the bad guys, Jonathan Banks and Torsten Voges---two pretty ugly bad guys---and about a dozen others. It's a pleasure just watching how ugly they are, and mean-looking too. I am a big Danny Trejo fan and I loved the movie. My wife does not like Danny Trejo, and she hated it. Enough said.",1394064000,5,1087,4.579487179487179

6087159,3,B00GMM11VM,"I have watched several of Danny Trejo's films.  Naturally, I started with ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" all of them
Then on to ""Machete"" and""Bad Ass.""  Although I must admit, the more of Danny's movies I saw, the cornier
they got.  Now they seem to have gone from just a bit corny to kind of ridiculous.  Personally I liked his earlier
movies better than his recent ones.  Maybe Danny should take a break and enjoy all the money he has made.
It seems that he never turns down any acting job if it fits into his schedule.",1402185600,,513,4.302083333333333
6087160,3,B00GMM11VM,"One of my favorite character actors.
One of his  highlights was in the movie HEAT with Al Pacino and Robert Deniro.",1399766400,2,115,4.476190476190476
6087161,4,B00GMM11VM,"Yes, I am a Trejo fan.  An extreme one, I admit. If you are a Trejo fan, this was a good story, with Mr. Trejo's performance being particularly good as he fights to save his grandson from criminals bent on preventing the execution of a death row inmate who deserves it. We even get to see him shirtless in an ""extreme fighting"" scene (Yay!)  This tough macho man shows his tender side when he deals with children, just as he did in the ""Spy Kids"" movies. Johnathan Banks, a graduate from ""Breaking Bad"" (can't remember if he shared screen time with ""Tortuga"") plays the condemned man's dad, determined to both kill Frank Bullet (Mr. Trejo), and also frame him for the crime his son is being executed for. However either he had make up that was particularly unflattering purposely, or they didn't use make up on him at all because this man was a collage of old age spots and  other skin issues and discolorations. Since I doubt they would have painted these spots on him, perhaps they did this to add to his arch-baddy character. Also, in some scenes, they used background music that sounded like it was from 1970 or 80 movies--way outdated and seemingly inappropriate for the film and somewhat loud and distracting in some parts.  Matter of fact the sound was not very good in some scenes and the dialog difficult to hear. This seems to improve over the course of the movie. Yes there was a bit of violence and the body count was high. But, it was still a really good shoot-em-up drama.  I wish that John Savage, who played the governor had gotten a better hair cut as he just didn't strike me as governor material. He looked a bit scruffy.  I live in Oregon, and our Governor is from the country in Southern Oregon and wears cowboy boots and jeans with corduroy jackets at our capitol.  But he still has way better grooming and hair cuts than the alleged governor in this movie.  Mr. Trejo shines again!",1398902400,,1904,4.498550724637681
6087162,3,B00GMM11VM,"I was a little disappointed, this movie had the potential to be better. Appeared as if the trailer had a bigger budget.",1398038400,,119,4.454545454545454
6087163,1,B00GMM11VM,"Danny Trejo is an actor in need of better management. Taking any script that comes along may seem like a good idea, but this trend he is in badly undermines the talent he has. The quality of a movie is defined by its appeal to the masses. Alas, this kind of flick has very limited appeal.",1397520000,,288,4.160714285714286

8624737,4,B00GMM11VM,"You know what you're going to get when you watch a Danny Trejo movie. This is no different. Trejo plays a cop whose grandson is kidnapped by the father of a druglord on death row. Said drugload gets Trejo to sign a confession saying his testimony was false and then wants Trejo to sign a suicide note. Of course, Trejo has no plans to do that.

The rest of the movie is about revenge. I'm not going to spoil anything for you because it is a pretty decent movie. Trejo has come a long way since San Quentin and his first ""barely get by"" movies.",1419292800,2,543,4.171428571428572
