8481635,5,B005OOFBLK,"Folks familiar with mid-century, post-war era Italian cinema will recognize the flavor of this film and, i believe, be delighted by the
simplicity and succinct way Lattuada wraps up the Gogol in a new cloak.  Some of the music cues are also fantastic and virtuosic.
Though not supposed to be of any specific time nor place, this work oozes the Italianate sensibility that Fellini fans might already be quite familiar with.  Highly recommendedheaps of stars.",1391990400,8,457,5.08
8481636,1,B005OOFBLK,"From the reviews of The Overcoat, I had anticipated a brilliant, sardonic comedy like Lattuada's amazing Mafioso. No such luck. The Overcoat is a rambling shaggy dog story in search of a workable tone. The only consolation is that this film was made a decade before Mafioso. Lattuada wasn't a kid in 1952, but he clearly hadn't gotten his act together yet.",1378684800,4,356,4.758064516129032
