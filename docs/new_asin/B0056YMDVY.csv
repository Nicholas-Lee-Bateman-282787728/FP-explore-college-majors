8459997,5,B0056YMDVY,"My special needs granddaughter loves these Dora DVDs. They play over and over, without having to restart them! She is 12 years old, and has microcephaly.  She loves the music in these, I suspect.  She does not like the Mermaid DVD in a different set. She is non-verbal, so I will never know what is special about these Dora stories. But this 3 pack are her favorites!",1472860800,,367,4.462686567164179

Hope they do the right thing and send the right movie s I do a lot of buying from them. I will begin to look elsewhere for my purchases if they don't make this right.
