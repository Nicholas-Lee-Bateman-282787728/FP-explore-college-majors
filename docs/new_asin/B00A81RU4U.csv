5399522,5,B00A81RU4U,"The Ballet Physique Workout does NOT fool around!  If you want to get muscle definition, you WILL get it with this!

This collection contains two killer ballet barre-style workouts:  the 60-minute ""Signature Sculpt,"" and the 45-minute ""Amped Up,"" billed as a shorter but more intense workout.  You use a barre (no need to buy one, a chair that's high enough is a perfect subsitute), light weights, the inflatable medicine ball that comes with the DVD...and good old gravity! The moves all ballet/dance based:  a lot of plies, leg lifts forward and back, hip rolls, tucks, pulsing on bent legs...You get the idea.  There's video of it online; check it out!

Though it's a pricier DVD program, you actually get plenty for your buck:  2 well-produced, incredibly challenging and effective workouts and an inflatable medicine ball (referred to here as a playground ball).

I wanted to try this style of workout because I so enjoy pilates and dance-based sculpting workouts (for example, I LOVE Tracy Anderson's sculpting workouts and the Exhale Core Fusion workouts).  I like using a chair and my own body weight to sculpt that long, lean look.  Soo...this was my first barre-style workout...and I think it may be my last.  I'll explain why.

My biggest issue with the workout is what it did to my body.  Mind you, I only used this once a week, for 3 weeks, when I noticed a difference in my body.  I am a high intermediate exerciser, and am happy with my body the way it is and pretty much work out for maintenance.  Within just a few performances of this workout, I noticed that I started to get RIPPED.  My abs, though already toned with nice lines, began to actually develop, if not yet a 6-pack, then definitely a 4-pak!  :-)  My thighs became thicker, albeit with muscle, and my calves started to get a muscular ripple in them (all those darn releves!!).  All of this would have made me astoundingly ecstatic...IF I desired those changes!  However, I loved the challenge, but did NOT want to develop my muscle tone beyond where it currently is.  I have nothing against very, very developed feminine muscle, but it's just not for me.  It's not a look I'm personally interested in. I was actually surprised at these results, because there is so much beautiful stretching in between the exercises.

So...for this reason alone, I have already, regrettably, retired the Ballet Physique DVDs.  But I AM going to keep them!  You never know when I may need an aggressive but gentle toning workout to jump-start a lazy physique (like post-pregnancy!!)  :-)

I highly recommend this workout; it does what it claims and is fun and challenging...but unfortunately, it's just not for me.

UPDATE:  So when I got tired of my previous Pilates-type workout, I finally took another look at these discs, collecting dust on my DVD shelf and thought, ""I miss these!""  I mean, they are a lot of fun, and I LOVED the challenge, so I pulled them out again...and fell in love!  The key to not overdeveloping, it finally occurred to me, is to just pull back on the strength intensity on one of my other workout days.  So since I work out 3 days a week, if I do this workout one day and Tonique another day, I just do something like gentle yoga or bellydance on the 3rd day, and presto, beautiful definition with no overdevelopment!  :-)  Ha, duh, it's so easy to manage!  And this DVD is a BALL!  So, 5 stars!!",1362960000,43,3387,4.67005076142132
5399523,5,B00A81RU4U,"If you love a good workout and want to see results soon, get these dvds.  The instructors are great!! I have been taking their classes for 1 1/2 yrs now and love them. I have  recently had some medical problem so I could not  attend as many classes as I would like to. But now when I have a ""good day"" I can workout at home and feel great!! Get these dvds you won't regret this buy, I PROMISE!!",1362873600,4,394,3.962025316455696
5399524,5,B00A81RU4U,"I have many barre DVDs, but these two workouts impressed me right away and have become favorites.  The instructors are very competent and provide good form tips.  However, there is a separate section if you need more indepth instruction.  Kristen Zurek leads Signature Sculpt, which is a 60-minute workout.  Amped Up is led by Kristin Skordahl, and even though it is shorter in length at 45 minutes, I would rate this as the more intense of the two DVDs.  However, both are tough, advanced barre workouts.  Each instructor is joined by three background exercisers, and one person shows modifications.  The production quality is quite good; nice, airy studio with wooden floors, exposed brick walls and windows in the back.  The music is generic but high energy.  Cueling is done live, not voiceover.  The pacing is perfect - not too fast or slow.  Even if you have an extensive barre collection, you will find many unique movements.  I received a very sturdy ball with my two DVDs although I was not able to blow it up because I did not have a pump.  Instead, I used a small, squishy mini-Fitball that I already had on hand and that seemed to work very well.",1360540800,10,1158,4.673267326732673
5399525,5,B00A81RU4U,I love this!  This is the best workout!  I have been taking these classes for two years now and am so excited to have the DVDs to do when I cannot get to class!  These girls make you want to do it!  I love both dvds and am sore each time I do them!  It is nice when you don't have a full hour to do the shorter 45 minute one.  Both Kristin's are amazing!  All the girls in video look amazing and make me want to do this workout as much as I can.  Buy it!  It's worth it!,1357603200,5,470,3.62
5399526,5,B00A81RU4U,"There are many DVD's covering the barre fitness workout method and I must say, The Ballet Physique delivers! They have carved out a unique niche that surpasses other styles and franchises. Kristen Z. and Kristen S. have formulated precise, challenging and fun choreography that will get you shaking and sweating in no time. The workouts are easy to follow but don't let the seamless flow fool you! These workouts are HARD but you will be thanking them later! I love how during a tough sequence they use fun anecdotes and reminders how the hard work pays off! Both instructors are down to earth and are wonderful examples of the what they are teaching. Do yourself a favor and buy these DVD's you will not be sorry and will definitely be thanking the ladies of The Ballet Physique. If you are in the Denver area, their classes are NOT to be missed!",1356825600,13,847,4.6158940397351
5399527,5,B00A81RU4U,Really appreciate the great service.  Love the Collection. Thanks,1425081600,,65,6.222222222222222
5399528,2,B00A81RU4U,"I was very enthusiastic about getting this DVD, I just recently started taking Adult Ballet classes & thought this would be a great supplement.  Although everyone means well in this video, the moves are completely out of time with the music.  The exercises are great but the music was driving me so crazy I only did the DVD once.  I would love to have another one that is in sync with the music please???",1412726400,,404,4.4324324324324325
5399529,5,B00A81RU4U,"These DVDs  are excellent.  I would consider myself an intermediate/advanced barre exerciser, and these, along with the advanced Bar Method DVDs, are part of my regular rotation. What's great about them is that the two workouts in this collection are very different.  Both target the key muscle groups, but there is almost no overlap between ""Signature Sculpt"" and ""Amped Up"". They both contain some nice twists on standard barre exercises, and some exercises that were completely new to me.  I find them both quite challenging--after doing them consistently for several months I still fatigue on some of the exercises.  But I've noticed significant gains in core strength and muscle definition.  I recommend these highly, and hope the instructors will bring out more DVDs.",1409788800,,773,5.2439024390243905
5399530,5,B00A81RU4U,"I have been using these for a couple of weeks now. And I have been to actual Pure Barre classes, and these DVD's are just like being in a Barre class! They are very challenging and very good! I have noticed that my body is looking good. I enjoy these workouts, the instructors are excellent and not annoying, and they include every part of your body in the workouts, so it is a total body workout! I have enjoyed these a lot! And I have saved money by not going to the gym. The ball that is included is good quality and a good size. Having in the past bought exercise balls, I already had a pump. So the set not including a pump, was not an issue for me. These workouts have me sweating, burning, and shaking! I always feel amazing when I am done with either one of the workouts. Both the workouts are EXCELLENT! The menu is easy to navigate, and it is a well put together set. This was a GREAT BUY for me!",1398038400,3,906,4.095505617977528
5399531,5,B00A81RU4U,"I loved the workout, but my DVD was damaged and I had to return it.  I am waiting to see if they get the problem sorted out so I can get a new set.  The workout is low impact but difficult enough to know that you are toning and stretching muscles.  I was looking forward to using this workout as part of my regular workout routine.  As soon as I wrote in about the DVD freezing up in places, I received an email from one of the staff.  They were very concerned and professional.  It was not a problem to return, my account was refunded immediately, and they assured me that they are checking into the problem.  Even though there is a problem with the DVD, I feel they deserve 5 stars because the workout is good and the staff are so accommodating.",1396656000,2,747,4.181818181818182
5399532,5,B00A81RU4U,The best I have found so far!  Great instruction and video's run the perfect length for a good all over tone-up.,1396569600,,112,4.333333333333333
5399533,1,B00A81RU4U,"I guess I seem to be in the minority,as I really did not get anything out of this dvd-it was very slow moving,did not contain enough reps to feel any burn and I had to do another workout after completing this one,as I did not feel worked out at all. I personally love Tracy Effinger's Squeeze&Squeeze Stronger dvds and Jessica Smith's new Barre dvd is so enjoyable-this was in my opinion,a total waste of money",1396310400,,410,4.48
5399534,5,B00A81RU4U,"I'm not often inclined to write reviews, but this set deserves my gratitude. I'm an exercise DVD junkie (I own TurboFire, BRazil Butt Lift, T25, Tonique & Cathe videos, The Bar Method, Ballet Beautiful, Pop Physique, P57, Kettlebell DVD's- I own so many it's ridiculous) but I've never LOVED a video like I love these two videos. First off, the RESULTS are amazing. I have that dreaded ""pear shape"" and loose skin from losing 85 lbs. after two pregnancies....sooooo, I don't really hold out MUCH hope when purchasing a new DVD to add to my addiction, ahem, collection. But this DVD really really works. I gained strength in just a few workouts and my flexibility has even increased! Places on my body that were riddled with cellulite (hello, backs of my thighs) have been smoothed out and where I used to have to search to find where my butt stopped and my legs began, I now have a nice round ""divider."" I consider myself a fit gal, but I am STILL needing to modify the exercises- prepare to take the class at your OWN pace. I'd find it difficult to believe that anyone could just start off doing this video without at least a mediocre barre background; it's challenging, but very doable- the instructors work you to the point of exhaustion, but do so in such a gentle, relaxing way. On that note, the instructors are two of the best I've come across in allllllll of my fitness DVD crazes. I look forward to working out with these gals- they are friendly and upbeat, have awesome cueing and form techniques, and the music is enjoyable (at least to me.) Anyone looking to reshape their bodies and gain strength should give these a try. Truly one of the best and I can't thank these gals enough for producing this amazing set!",1394236800,13,1724,4.564516129032258
5399535,5,B00A81RU4U,"I bought these DVD's hoping they wouldn't bore me to death.......and I was pleasantly surprised!  These workouts are so fun to do and I feel worked afterward.  Just when you think you can't possibly do another rep, the exercise changes.  There are some exercises that really get into the muscle and I noticed a slimness to my core and legs after doing these consistently with some other cardio DVD's.  When I want a workout that isn't too hard and that doesn't have a dread factor, I reach for these.",1390089600,4,500,4.584269662921348
5399536,4,B00A81RU4U,"This workout is more challenging than I thought it would be! I love a good challenge and I definitely see results in my body! I'm more toned, and tight and slender! You don't have to have any dance experience to do this workout!",1387670400,2,228,4.325581395348837
5399537,5,B00A81RU4U,"You work out  with ladies who execute class.

Professionally prepared video that has several degrees of levels.

I enjoy doing the program!

Get the set with the ball. It really is the best way to go.
I went to Target in the bicycle dept. and purchased pump and several needles to inflate the ball. Not a big deal at all.. B elides it is good to have this this kit  on hand

Very good program. You'll love it!",1387411200,3,409,4.17948717948718
5399538,4,B00A81RU4U,"This workout is alright.  My girls had a lot of fun with it at first, but it quickly got old.  The exercises are repetitive, and makes the video seem slow.",1385078400,,155,4.133333333333334
5399539,5,B00A81RU4U,"I bought this set based on a previous review that said that adding in these workouts helped that person shape up really quickly.  I already own all of the Physique 57 workouts, the Pop Physique set, and Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre workouts, but I feel like this is a nice set, and I'm really happy to add it to my collection!

This set comes with two DVDs and a ball, but not a pump.  I wasn't sure if I needed the ball, but it's a bit smaller than my Physique 57 ball and works perfectly for the workouts.  To do the workouts, you'll also want  a pair of lighter and heavier weights (I've been using 3's and 5's), a mat, and a ballet barre or chair.

The two women who lead the workouts are both excellent instructors, and they give exceptional curing in their workouts. Also, each workout has an optional form pointers section that you can watch before you do the workout.  The tips they cover are really useful.

On its DVD cover, Signature Sculpt says that it's 60 minutes long, but it's really 107 minutes, and, while Amped Up purports to be 45 minutes long, it's really 52 minutes.  I don't mind the longer workout times, but just be forewarned.

These are definitely tough workouts, but there is a modifier in each one and you can follow along with that person if you need to.

Overall, these are really nice barre workouts, and I can tell that I'll use them a lot.

UPDATE ON 4-8-14:  I haven't used these for awhile because I noticed that when I was just using them, I gained some girth in my thigh measurements.  I had the same problem when I was just doing the Physique 57 workouts (and no other workouts).  I'm an hourglass, so I think it's because of my body type. I still think that these are great workouts, but would be careful if you're an hourglass and if you tend to put on weight in your lower  half easily.",1381449600,10,1828,4.33235294117647
5399540,5,B00A81RU4U,Great leg and ab workout!  Only complaint I have is the instructor is a little vague at times. I took a barre class after I purchased the video set to compare. Very similar. I am very glad I purchased the video. Would definitely recommend it!,1381449600,2,242,4.377777777777778
5399541,4,B00A81RU4U,"I have been doing Bar Method DVD's, P57 and Pure Barre classes since 2011. This set is a great variation to add to the rotation. The Ballet Physique ball is very hard (unlike the squishy P57 ball), so you will definitely feel the burn during the series. The instructions note not to over-inflate the ball. You still want some ""give."" Make sure you have a pump and needle to inflate the ball. The warm-up and upper body on both Amped Up and Signature Sculpt contains great variations w/ beg. and advanced modifications: high plank, push-ups, side plank with a crunch etc. There are also multiple exercises for thighs and seat that work every area. 'Amped Up' contains pretzel, and all-fours with a weight behind the knee. However, I wish the last section of abs was more challenging. 'Signature Sculpt' has standing seat and arabesque variations for seat, and a killer set of calve raises in first position and in 'coupe' with one leg. The instructors are bubbly and motivating without being annoying. So, if you were not a fan of Tanya Becker's chatiness in P57, rest assured these instructors have little irritation factor.",1373068800,10,1124,4.829015544041451
5399542,5,B00A81RU4U,"I've been doing these workouts for almost two months now. Within a month's time I was noticing how much more toned I was becoming.  I am now able to fit into my size 2 and some of my size 0 clothing. I've also maintained my weight during this time, even though my diet has been less than perfect.
As if that weren't enough motivation, I actually love doing the workouts!  The time flies by and I can just tell that the unique moves are working.  For reference I've done Ballet Beautiful, Physique 57 and Tracy Anderson.  This one reminds me somewhat of Physique 57, but somehow I find it more enjoyable!  I would say they are intermediate workouts, but by using modifications, would be appropriate for a beginner.  There are also options for advanced excercisers.",1372809600,7,763,4.614814814814815

I have done all of Jari Love's, Core Fusion, Jillian Michaels, etc and have some other dance based workouts, but this one has now become a true favorite.  I really appreciate the cueing and the encouragement when it gets tough.  The ab work is amazing and my legs got a fabulous workout.

My only gripe is that some workouts are done only on one side, though they seem to do complementing exercises after. If this bothers you, just keep track of which side you did last time and alternate.

Overall a great workout, and though longer than some other quick, circuit-type DVDs, it will definitely be time well spent. I'm feeling a difference in the way my jeans fit after only a few sessions!",1368748800,4,643,4.5344827586206895

I wasn't going to buy anymore, but after reading the reviews on The Ballet Physique I decided to get them. I am really glad I did. There are moves that are familiar barre moves, with some unique and subtle tweeks to old familiars. Actually all the above mentioned workouts have unique features, but I like to alternate my workouts so I actually do them. I love the instructors on these. They are pleasant and give good instruction. The workouts are tough. The two workouts are actually different from each other. For example the seat work on Signature is mostly at the barre, and the seat work on Amped is mostly on the floor. Good for muscle confusion. They also have 3 different levels of exercises, and in the intro they tell you how to modify if you have knee problems or a weak core. The Amped video is shorter in length than the Signature video, but both are intense workouts. On Amped some of the seat work is done with a dumbell behind the knee, and during the abs there is a section where you work your arms with lighter weights while working the abs the abs at the same time.
