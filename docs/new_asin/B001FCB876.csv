8301889,4,B001FCB876,"i enjoyed this. Metzger does a good job of telling the story and showing what this hard enduro is all about. also has some enduro cross footage.

he goes over to europe to ride and experience . this is his tale.

i wish there was more riding footage during the actual hell's gate part of the film.

i often felt like the camera cut away way too soon.

its better than most of the other hard enduro films i have viewed because there is an actual story being told.

just buy it. its good one to have in your moto-collection . you will probably watch it a few times... i have.
