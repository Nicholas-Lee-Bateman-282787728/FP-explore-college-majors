5578993,5,B00BCPOEIG,"This series was rich with Yakuza connections but this is a mob of seafolk. The story was easy to follow and very comical. The English voice cast was great, and the story was insaine. I love that kind of craziness. Of course it is the typical anime with the typical 24-26 episode arch, so if you have had your fill of that, you should stay away. The S.A. V. E. series is a gret deal of course so the price is a no brainer. I don't believe I have a tolorence limit to this stuff. Keep it coming Japan. Feed my need.",1373846400,17,513,4.03921568627451
5578994,4,B00BCPOEIG,"First the show Is great its funny there's allot of mayhem and may get strange or inappropriate for younger audiences from time to time. The main characters are a little young.

Comes in your average DVD case with flipping dividers 4 discs. I do not know the difference between the SAVE edition and regular other than the fact that the case is literally telling you you're being cheap for buying this edition.

My product came with broken bits of the middle CD holder where you push down to release the disc but it serves my purpose.",1369958400,4,532,4.53125

There are Disks printed with basic graphics. The case is a standard DVD case that holds 2 DVDs on each sleeve. There are center tabs that hold the DVDs secure. Mine did not skip and all played well. No additional booklets or information. This is a case. A double sided print cover. So you get a couple extra pictures and info on the inside of the case. Clear see through case. The discs, Cases and printing is the same as I would expect if I had purchased at a store front.  This is 4 Discs, in English Dub or Japanese with English sub.

This is a S.A.V.E combo pack. If you just want to own the DVDs with out all the extras. This is exactly what your looking for.",1473811200,,828,3.946107784431138

5579023,4,B00BCPOEIG,"This is a great romantic comedy!  Well, more comedy then romance, but there both there none the less.  For a comedy I think the jokes are pretty great!  I didn't laugh real hard at em but they did put a big smile on my face, although there are a few jokes from a particular episode that aimed for the weird and shock factor that were more creepy then funny in my opinion.  The Romance in this show is very very light.  Only 3 episodes, the first, second, and last, really develop it, and even then its not by much, but there is romantic tension sprinkled through each episode, but like I said, its very light.  My Bride is a Mermaid is a pretty average Romantic Comedy.  The jokes are good, the romance isn't all that great, the animation is decent (with a few good exceptions), the story starts out promising but plateaus pretty quick into your typical Highschool Comedy, and the Main Character totally pulls the ""last episode victory"" out of his ass, but this show is still a joy to watch!  Absolutely worth the price and a nice addition to any collection!  Its not perfect, but its very enjoyable, and i'm glad I bought it!",1457481600,3,1126,4.427184466019417

5579051,4,B00BCPOEIG,"This is a madcapped, manic, and very funny series.  I watched it twice in a row.  The best thing about getting the DVD's is that you can back up and go through a segment one frame at a time to see some of the crazy animation that goes by in the blink of an eye.  Sun Seto is a mermaid who saves a boy's life.  But, according to mermaid law, if a human sees a mermaid either the mermaid or the human must die.  Sun's dad, the leader of the Seto Gang, a Japanese style mafia, would be glad to see the boy die, but Sun is willing to marry the boy and if they get married then neither will have to die.  My Bride Is A Mermaid will bring you hours of entertainment for the price of a couple movie tickets.  It's a pretty good deal.",1426032000,4,726,3.8979591836734695

too much yelling in the hole thing",1425081600,,150,3.774193548387097
5579053,5,B00BCPOEIG,"This series is quite funny. I love the feel of this series, being very ""Ocean-y"" as i do enjoy movies and shows that deal with the ocean a lot.

5579057,5,B00BCPOEIG,"This anime, is so hilarious.  I couldn't even stop laughing at this anime when I watched it. It is definitely a great comedy. You just need to watch this anime, to understand, its worth a five star rating.",1423785600,,205,4.394736842105263
5579058,4,B00BCPOEIG,"I love this anime, XD Todd Haberkorn is like my favorite voice actor. The thing that makes it so funny to me personally is the ""whining puppy noise"" usually played when someone is thrown around like a Ragdoll or angrily yelled at.",1423267200,,230,4.5
5579059,3,B00BCPOEIG,"It's a very fast paced show and has very little romance, but I guess that's why I didn't like it. The show really blows your ears off with constant screaming, and the very mean-spirited comedy in this show was absolutely not for me. Unlike most romantic comedies, this one focuses more on torturing the main character (much like Squidward in Spongebob) rather than focusing on romantic scenes and relaxed moments.",1422230400,,413,4.914285714285715

5579062,5,B00BCPOEIG,My husband is a huge anime fan and I am not but I have to say that I really enjoy this series. It has many moments where I literally have laughed out loud and the story is really great! My husband said there are some translation issues on this set but a casual anime watcher won't know the difference. This is a really funny series!,1421452800,,332,4.123076923076923
5579063,4,B00BCPOEIG,"This show is always good for a few laughs. The only thing bad about series like this is that the ending isn't all that satisfying. In a sense this feels like a watered down version of Heavens lost property. However it does a better job in my opinion at delivering actual comedy. Other harem anime will usually mistake a character trait as comedy. Usually its in the case of something perverted happens and thats the joke or the character is a pervert and thats the joke. This show opts to actually have sometimes whole episodes dedicated to running gags. There is an episode where the fathers dress as school girls to deepen their relationships with their daughters and they just run with it as an episode. In other harem anime the comedy would be a guy falls into a girl and pervy stuff happens or the guy wants to see a girl naked. That isn't comedy that's fanservice character traits.

So if you want a funny harem rom com then I would give this a recommendation.",1421107200,3,966,4.488636363636363
5579064,4,B00BCPOEIG,"Funny, sweet, a little odd, a little predictable at times, a bit of action, and some humor doesn't necessarily translate well, but in a lower cost SAVE box set, worth a look.  Check other reviews for a more complete description of the series.",1420588800,,242,4.627906976744186

5579066,5,B00BCPOEIG,This show is insanely hilarious. It has excellent comedy and will having you laughing with every episode that you watch.

5579067,5,B00BCPOEIG,u will find nothing more silly than this anime but its amazing regardless even some of the more sad parts arnt that sad its just a very fun anime to watch its worth every penny,1419120000,,176,4.057142857142857

5579069,5,B00BCPOEIG,"This is in my top ten favorite anime. It had me laughing all the way through, from Nagasumi and his parents' horror at getting involved with yakuza to the over-the-top conclusion(s). Every time the hero turns around, he encounters another bizarre character, seemingly bent on his destruction (or at least driving him insane). The title theme, Romantic Summer, has become one of my favorite songs (largely by association).

At the risk of spoiling something, picture the Terminator, complete with loads of ""Ahnold"" quotes delivered in impeccable dead-pan--wearing a Japanese school-girl's uniform. Now picture his uptight daughter's horror when he shows up at school. I just about lost it.",1415577600,,688,5.37037037037037

5579073,4,B00BCPOEIG,hahah I really enjoyed this anime not sure if it is appropriate for younger audiences so my suggestion is to screen it before letting them see it just so you don't have to have an awkward talk with your kid about how it isn't ok to call people by certain names that will not be repeated in public. all in all its funny romantic and idk why but my favorite person in this series is the grandma becuase she is old and cute. I love cute old people and she reminds me of my grandma in a way.,1406419200,,487,3.979591836734694
5579074,4,B00BCPOEIG,The story is wildly entertaining if you are into the whole Slice of Life - comedy genre. The characters are interesting and well developed (in most cases) and the nostalgia factor for myself really makes this series DVD bundle a great buy.,1401840000,,239,4.714285714285714

5579076,4,B00BCPOEIG,"""My Bride is a Mermaid"" is a hilarious anime! Funimation did a great job with the English dub. The dvd release is great but some flaws keep it from a perfect score. First off is the ugly green ""S.A.V.E."" band that borders the entire box. It really clashes with the cool blue of the art and simple looks horrendous. I wish they've chosen a more complementing color. Another thing is the 2nd ending is terribly executed; as the song plays, but the video doesn't. It's just a still image instead of the actual animation. Which is a letdown, as the animation for that ending is adorable. Other than that, ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" is a great watch and I would suggest this ""S.A.V.E."" version for a tight-budget anime fan who wants to laugh.",1395532800,,734,4.485074626865671

5579079,5,B00BCPOEIG,I like this anime because it had different elements of suprises that I did not expect.  I love the characters I thought the acting was really good in it. It is a really fun anime series. It also had a good and cute story line to it.  Even though in parts it was kind of weird like other animes are overall it was a really cute show.  This is why I gave it five stars.,1394064000,,367,3.8666666666666667

I showed it to my friends and they were balling off the couch.  It is an anime worth buying I recommend it because the dubs are pretty good in this anime.,1383091200,4,329,4.015384615384615

5579089,4,B00BCPOEIG,"But didn't seem to be coming over any reasonable timeframe (I do know the show was recorded in at least 720p resolution), so finally broke down and bought this set.  Very, very funny, and definitely went in some directions I didn't expect.",1382313600,,239,4.690476190476191
5579090,5,B00BCPOEIG,"This series is hilarious. I find that it's laugh out loud funny and my brother and I frequently lapse into doing impersonations of characters from the show.

It isn't original. A lot of the drama is contrived and you aren't surprised by much. I think what makes this funny is that it doesn't try to be original or stand out --it's just simply entertaining. That's a two thumbs up from two 40+ year old dads, two teens and on fledgling college student plus a grandmother.",1381363200,,470,4.529411764705882
5579091,5,B00BCPOEIG,"This was the first time I watched this and it was hilarious to the point of tears.

5579092,4,B00BCPOEIG,"Interesting twist on folklore and fantasy.  Harem comedy with some drama.  Definitely fan-fare with cheesy comedy, but the character development is really good.  Covers alot of adult topics and complications in life wrapped up in junior high school series.  Finding a purpose in your life at 14. . .and being betrothed.  That's a heavy burden.

I don't know about the whole Yakuza thing, but how they talk is from old roaring 20's days back during the gangster time periods.  Amusing to say the least.",1380499200,,501,4.892857142857143
5579093,5,B00BCPOEIG,"""My Bride is a Mermaid"" is an adaptation of a Manga series originally serialized in a Square-Enix magazine in Japan. How the plot goes is that a young 14-year-old boy by the name of Nagasumi is on vacation visiting his grandmother's at the Seto Inland Sea, and while he is swimming out in the sea, he starts to drown (for unknown reasons), and is later saved by a mermaid by the name of San Seto. Turns out that San Seto is not your ""typical"" mermaid as she is the daughter of the head boss of a Yakuhza crime family, and due to the Mermaid Code, since Nagasumi saw San in her mermaid form, one of them must be killed. Now there is a loophole to this by simply allowing Nagasumi to marry into the family, thus saving both their lives.

This is a ""Harem Anime"" genre where our main hero earns the affections of several young women, such as: Mawari, the Superintendent General's daughter and childhood friend of Nagasumi; Lunar, another fellow mermaid that happens to be a national pop star as well as daughter of the head of the Edomae Crime Family; and Class Rep, a ""mousy-glasses"" that is the class rep for Nagasumi's classroom that wishes for people to call her by her true name.

Of course there are also an extended cast of hilarious characters that helps make this show great, such as: Chimp, the pervy best-friend of Nagasumi but has an alternative identity as ""Chimp Roshi"", a wise hermit in the ways of womanizing; Masa, Afro wearing lieutenant of the Seto gang that is unbelievably cool and smooth and can immediately attract the lustful affections of just about anyone including Nagasumi and his married mom; Maki, a foot tall, two-faced assassin for the Seto gang and personal bodyguard of San; Edomae, Lunar's father and head of the Edomae gang, he is hilarious all on his own as he is based off the Terminator and just Arnold Schwarzenegger in general; and there are just so many more memorable characters that makes this show great!

This show is definitely worth the watch due to its hilarious and memorable characters that keep getting into situations that will keep you laughing from start to finish of the entire 26-episode series! It has both Japanese Sub and English Dub, but despite it being dubbed by FUNimation, the voice acting is surprisingly well done, and just like any voice acting should be, there voices help further define their characters. It has all the over-the-top moments as typical Anime does, and comedy that is so ingeniously written that you will have to pause it just so you can finish laughing and not miss a thing. Normally I would suggest to people to watch an anime before you buy, but I undoubtedly know that you will just fall in love with this show and keep watching it again and again! I especially recommend it since its at a very cheap and affordable price!",1378252800,30,2808,4.623246492985972
5579094,5,B00BCPOEIG,"This is one of the first series I watched that wasn't called Naruto or Bleach.  It has left me on the ground laughing numerous times.  I've shown this to several of my friends and they have loved it as well.

My advice is to not judge it after the first episode.  The first episode lays out the groundwork for the plot and takes you to the real adventure.  It does not truly grab you until the second episode.  From then on it is a crazy mix of traditional anime themes like harems and high school life.  There is plenty of pop culture references throughout the season as well.

The Funimation version of this has the english dub as well as the japanese with english subtitles.  I am tried the first few episodes in english dub but like most anime if you start off with japanese you can't really go away from it.  I would recommend the Japanese voice acting with subtitles so you can fully understand how crazy some of these characters get.  Whenever the characters illustration gets exaggerated or chibi the voice actors do a great job of showing it in their voice acting.

One of the negatives I had on this series are probably the last several episodes.  It almost seems like the story is forced on you and the tone is a little bit darker.  This was most likely a way for them make an actual ending for the series when the show was not getting renewed.

Overall, I think this series is great.  Even with the odd changes in the last several episodes the ride itself was well worth it.",1377475200,8,1486,4.368613138686132
