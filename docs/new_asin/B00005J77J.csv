1428035,3,B00005J77J,"You can read the other reviews and get the storyline; what I wish I had known before I bought this movie is that there is a fairly graphic, bloody scene in which Nico's mother, the little boy's beloved pony, is killed by a mountain lion.  My 5-year old, senstive, animal-loving daughter watched this movie a month ago and is still haunted, to the point of tears, day and night, by memories of this scene...  As a parent, I feel very guilty for not prescreening this movie before showing it to my daughter - but I never imagined such an awful scene in a children's movie.  She still enjoys the story and wants to watch the movie, oddly enough, but we have to fast-forward past a large section of it every time.",1018656000,21,709,4.396946564885496
1428036,5,B00005J77J,"Nico the unicorn is so neat and fantastic! Its about A boy who
got in an accident and had a hurt leg then he got twenty dollars
so he was going to school and saw a old carnival and he checked it out so he saw a poor minature pony who was dressed as a fack unicorn the guy that ran the carnival was going to sell it (He was a drunk) so the boy bought the pony and left without the pony he was going to get her the next day.told his mom she finally got talked into it. they came to get the pony and he beat her almost to death so they got the pony and cleaned, and fixed her up later
he finds out shes pregnant she had her baby and it was a unicorn and then thats when the real adventure starts!!!

1428113,5,B00005J77J,"I bought this movie for my unicorn loving granddaughter. I gave her a package of unicorn related items and she was so pleased. Her parents were urged to preview the video before showing it to her. She was so excited at the package. I have not heard anything from her parents that the video was too old for her. So, I would purchase it again.",1401926400,,341,4.2615384615384615
1428114,5,B00005J77J,I searched high and low for this movie after having seen it on tv years ago. After finding it on Amazon I was able to watch it with my daughters and it became one of their favourite movies as well. An incredible story that brings out the believer in all of us.,1400544000,,260,4.019230769230769

1428116,4,B00005J77J,"I agree with one other reviewer that I wish the scene with the mother pony dying had been left out.  Story could have proceeded with momma pony still be alive.  Hate it whenever an animal dies in a movie.  But it is a nice, family oriented movie otherwise.  Those of us who choose to believe in elves, fairies, unicorns and dragons (I'm 69 but still a child at heart) will surely enjoy the movie.  I viewed it through Amazon Prime for free and would like to say that having a Prime account has proved well worth the cost to me.",1396224000,,527,4.23

1428138,5,B00005J77J,"Our family really enjoyed this movie.  I didn't expect to be surprised, however, there were some really great twists.  For a family movie, it was just right, and the magic in it was for good.  I highly recommend this movie for those who like fantasy films and want something light.  There were a few scary and very tragic moments, so not always comfortable for the kiddies... But the lessons in the film are good.",1392422400,,413,4.54054054054054

1428143,5,B00005J77J,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nico-the-Unicorn/dp/B003TNS3EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nico the Unicorn</a>&nbsp;A semi-fantasy live action film, not a cartoon.  Good horse integration and plot development.  A plausible story given a unicorn.

Unicorns are mentioned in the King James version of the Bible 9 times, in 5 different books, by at least 5 different authors: by Balaam, Moses, David, Isaiah, and even God himself in the book of Job. These are the verses that mention unicorns: Numbers 23:22, Numbers 24:8, Job 39:9, Job 39:10, Psalms 29:6, Psalms 92:10, Deuteronomy 33:17, Psalms 22:21, Isaiah 34:7 ""And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls ...""  The word unicorn is not mentioned in any of the modern translations. Only in the King James version are they mentioned. Most of the modern translations say ""wild ox."" Some translations ""rhino.""

I started watching the film with some trepidation.  Some films like this lack good plot, good dialogue, good acting or more.  But this film was a real gem, and we watched it from start to finish.  If they could keep up the story, a sequel would be worth watching ... ""The second legend of Nico"".",1377216000,,1224,5.439153439153439
1428144,4,B00005J77J,"This is a wonderful tale of a young boy with a physical handicap who discovers the power of friendship and loyalty when his pony gives birth to a unicorn. There are some kissing scenes here involving the boy's mom and her policeman boyfriend but nothing overly graphic. There is also a tense scene involving a mountain lion attacking the pony.
The movie is Not Rated and runs 95 minutes. I'd recommend this film for children ages 6-10.",1369958400,,435,4.662337662337662

1428167,4,B00005J77J,the movie came in pefect conditions.. THe movie is fine for my 7 year old daughter who love unicorns. Not scarey at all. THough blood bites are shown. I didn't like the main kids attitude what a brat and his language (using the Lords name in vain) a couple times.. but other than that.. its a fine flick to watch as a family. would i buy it again if this one gets damaged. .probably not.,1357344000,,387,4.173333333333333

1428170,4,B00005J77J,"The unicorn is perfect. Beautiful, smart and loving. The movie is a good story. But, there are a few scenes parents should be aware of.  In the first scene, The man ""that is trying to sell a pony to the slaughter house"", comes in to wear the pony is, drunk. He starts hitting her with a stick. Then later, the boy finds her practically dead. She looks dead, and you can see blood on her. The boy, yells at the man, that he killed her. My daughter was horrified. Later in the movie, there is a scene with a mountain lion. You see the mountain lion once before. The second time it comes, the unicorns mother ends up outside the barn with it. The mountain lion attacks her. The boy finds her dead. It was a frightening scene. In conclusion, my children were undecided weather or not to keep it. It ends beautifully, and gives a breathtaking view of the unicorns ""world"". They loved that. If I could remove those other scenes, I would say it was wonderful. I am writing this review, because, someone else left a review, warning about the mountain lion scene. So, I didn't let my children watch that part. So, I am warning about the drunk man scene. -Thanx-",1324857600,5,1152,4.383177570093458

1428172,4,B00005J77J,"After the huge disappointment of ""The Little Unicorn"", I was rather wary of picking up a ""family"" unicorn film, but this film proved truly pleasing to the heart. ""Nico"" not only has sympathetic characters, but gorgeous scenery, a striking unicorn, and a moving message. Billy Hastings is a young boy who has coped with not only the loss of his father, but a crippled leg from the accident that killed him. His heart, however, is completely whole and he proves this when he saves a poor battered circus pony from a cruel master. The pony, after being restored by Billy and his mother's kindness, gives birth to a baby unicorn. When the unicorn, Nico, grows into a gorgeous adult, his existence is soon discovered and released to the press by a group of greedy kids. When Billy resolves to take Nico up a mountain to freedom, both their lives are put on the line as the race for freedom begins. If you assume that there are some corny moments in the film, you'd be right. However, the corniness is actually minimum and the film is truly moving. One of my favorite parts was getting a glimpse into the unicorn's world, an achingly gorgeous paradise scene that I hadn't been expecting. All the actors, including the beautiful Anne Archer, do great jobs.

Parents, as a few people have pointed out, there is a disturbing scene where Nico's sweet mother is fatally attacked by a mountain lion. A few have called this scene not very disturbing, but it certainly rattled me (even though I was expecting it) and I have no doubt kids could be bothered by it too. I was surprised by one person's comment that it's no big deal because all it shows is the pony with several cuts on her. Um, that's still disturbing, as the ""cuts"" were large wounds that the pony was bleeding profusely from; plus, it does show the mountain lion bite her hard at one point. I don't want to dissuade parents from letting kids see it by any means; just please watch with your kids. Recommended!",1150848000,13,1961,4.5710227272727275
1428173,5,B00005J77J,I enjoyed this video so much.  Second time around enjoyed it even more.  What a wonderful story for young and old alike.  I am a 68 year old woman and cannot tell you how much pleasure I received from watching this video.  In fact I enjoyed it so much I am purchasing it for my grand daughter so we can watch it together when I visit her. Nico the Unicorn gave me much pleasure and I am sure Emily will also enjoy watching it with her family.,1048636800,11,442,4.045977011494253

7938489,5,B00005J77J,everything perfect,1463270400,,18,8.5
7938490,3,B00005J77J,"What they are trying to do here is very charming. The story and the idea is very good. The Unicorn is beautiful, but the acting is quite cringing. The boy always sounds like he's whining, and the mother is such a workaholic with such a bland personality, and most weird, the girl friend sounds like a boy. Not kidding, she sounds like a boy. It kinda catches viewers off and ruins scenes with her in it.

But I think my biggest complaint is some lines delivered. Some lines said make no sense. Like when the Pony (Who is given no name) gives birth, instead of calling a vet, the kids do it themselves.

Why? Because, and I quote the line ""We have to do it ourselves"" Um....I'm sorry to be such a critic but that makes no sense at all. The kids bad acting makes many scenes awkward and ruins the magic of the awesome story.

The movie is also quite mean spirited at times for kids. We see a man beating up a pregnant pony, we see a mountain lion kill the same pony, etc. The mountain lion is another issue I have with the movie.

Here's what makes no sense about it. Why does this lion solely want this Pony and Unicorn? Aren't there any deer in these mountains? The Mountain lion came one night, and then left seeing humans were there.

Then he came a second time, killing the pony. But then he comes a THIRD time! Seriously?! Why can't this lion screw off? He tries to attack the Unicorn but the Unicorn scares him off.

His third appearance was very pointless and only about 15 seconds long. There was also no point to the Zookeeper returning. The zookeeper, who abused the pony, returns during the end of the movie to shoot the Unicorn, only to be chased by the police. The point? None. They never come back to it.

The girl who sounds like a boy is also a huge annoyance. Its like the creator just made her character to be a total Screw up and move the plot along. She's the one who opens her big mouth about the Unicorn, causing people to come, and she also messes up again later in the movie.

While there are great visuals, the Unicorn is amazing to watch and it does have a great story, Bad Acting and bad characters and major loose ends ruin it. It's a decent flick to watch if you can endure the horrible acting, but I wouldn't call it buyable either.",1447632000,,2261,4.266355140186916
