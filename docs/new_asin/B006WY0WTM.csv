5026332,5,B006WY0WTM,"This is a great DVD for Dirty Job fans however I believe the title is misleading.  I think it should have been ""Dirty Jobs - The Specials""  This DVD has the special episodes of Dirty Jobs that are never included in the full dvd seasons or the Dirty Job Collection dvds.  The rather general product description fails to include the specifics of what the DVD includes:

1. The Dirty Truth
Mike Rowe serves up an alternative to worn out cliches with six hard-earned lessons gleaned from 250 Dirty Jobs.

2. Dirty Conversations
Mike is joined by long-time fans, Carolyn and Marilyn Maedel for a look at never-before-seen footage featuring unusual, skewed, and quirky conversations he's had with a colorful array of characters

3. Dirty DNA
Mike is joined by his own mom and dad as he takes a look back at the family businesses he has visited over the years.

4. Dirty Infrastructure
Mike reviews America's Infrastructure Report Card, issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, as he pays tribute to the men and women who fight an uphill battle working to keep the infrastructure from crumbling.

5. Dirty Holidays
On this special episode, Mike revisits the holiday jobs he has worked.  From turkeys and reindeer to cranberries and parade floats, Mike shows us the dirt, sweat, and poop that go into the jobs that get us ready for the holidays.

I do wish it had included all of the special DJ episodes but this is a definite start on some of the best special episodes so far.",1350086400,18,1479,4.675675675675675
