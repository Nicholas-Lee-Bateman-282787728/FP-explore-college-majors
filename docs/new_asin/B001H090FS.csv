3622310,5,B001H090FS,Excellent stories and acting. I can't wait for one chapter to end and I can start the next,1430611200,,90,4.055555555555555
3622311,5,B001H090FS,"I am an old ""geezer"" who loves WWII history. I bought Secret Army series 1 and enjoyed the setting and the plot of the series. I would very much like to get series 2 and 3 but have not been able to locate those series for showing in area 1 (U.S. and Canada.)",1429056000,3,258,3.8867924528301887
3622312,5,B001H090FS,Very true and very well acted.  A must see for sure.,1427328000,,52,3.727272727272727
3622313,3,B001H090FS,Got better as it went along.  Not the greatest done in that era.,1421884800,,64,3.923076923076923
3622314,4,B001H090FS,"I went ahead and bought the entire Series from Amazon  and found it was quite good. It was a bit dated however, but then it was made in 1979, so I really am not complaining. It showed what the Belgium's had to contend with, and what they did to help the downed Pilots of the R.AF. Thank you Amazon for always getting me the things that I want. You are an excellent Company top deal with.

3622315,3,B001H090FS,"The writing is great, the acting superb. My only complaint is the mood. A little too gritty and negative for my taste.",1419120000,4,118,4.409090909090909
3622316,5,B001H090FS,We really enjoyed this series and will be buying series 2 and 3.  The acting and direction are taut.  The total concept is correct in every detail.  It is not for nothing that this series is still going over three decades later. Classic in every detail,1232841600,12,252,4.434782608695652
3622347,5,B001H090FS,Great series!  Wish Amazon had more seasons. Any one know where you can get all three seasons in region 1 format?,1461024000,,113,4.380952380952381
3622348,5,B001H090FS,Gripping drama set in WW2. Sympathetic characters. Excellent plots. Terrific cast.,1454371200,,82,6.545454545454546
3622349,5,B001H090FS,"I have really been enjoying this series.  I had never heard of it before, so I bought a few episodes and ended up buying the whole season.  Well done series.",1454025600,,157,4.2
3622350,3,B001H090FS,"Its an ok show, just not worth the cost of the season, at least not to me",1451692800,,73,3.3529411764705883
3622351,5,B001H090FS,"Loved it. It took me by surprise. All I felt was what courage those people had doing what did day in and day out God Bless them. I wanted to order the next season but its; not for the USA consumption, why T don;t know!!",1450396800,,219,3.888888888888889

3622354,4,B001H090FS,"This is  very good program. Although it's set in Belgium, all the character speak English. I thought this might take away from the show but it doesn't. My only complaint is that it costs about $2.00 per episode even though the series is older",1446076800,,242,4.5
3622355,5,B001H090FS,Very good series,1445990400,,16,4.666666666666667

3622368,1,B001H090FS,Old film that hasn't aged well.,1442016000,,31,4.333333333333333
3622369,5,B001H090FS,I look forward when I can down load Season 2 and 3. This is an excellent series. I have enjoyed Season 1.,1441670400,,105,3.8181818181818183

3622372,2,B001H090FS,"Well.
The era and the subject are of great interest to me and I have watched dozens of various things....documentaries, movies and films, series about La Resistance but this one is so sadly weak.
Maybe it is the time it was filmed....Seventies....but is just seems too pedestrian in every, possible way.
Grainy film; ridiculous, confusing, screwy plots; melodramatic acting; sets that look like they were left over from a play....even the staging of the actors seems like they first did this on stage and then got a ""great idea"" to film it.
There are several loose threads as well......some of the episodes grind to a confusing halt with lingering questions over what happened to whom.
It is painful to watch but I am plodding along.",1439424000,3,733,4.872
3622373,5,B001H090FS,Nice gritty drama.,1438992000,,18,5.333333333333333
3622374,5,B001H090FS,"The only thing I disliked about this series is that seasons 2 & 3 are not available in the States.  The series is well acted and written.  Based on real events that took place in Belgium during WWII.  We follow the exploits of a group of men and women who run an ""Evasion Line"" to help ""Evaders""  escape the Nazi's. Bernard Hepton, who was in I, Claudius, is Albert Foiret, an Innkeeper.  Michael Culver from Cadfael, is Major Brandt, the German commander, and Jan Francis is Lisa ""Yvette"" Colbert, the resistance leader.  Some of the episodes are depressing and some are uplifting.  The reason some of the Episodes are depressing is they don't always have a happy ending.  People die.  Some of the Good guys are killed by Germans and some Germans are killed by the Resistance.  There are a few episodes where evaders are killed by the resistance to protect the resistance.  Each episode is very suspenseful and you often wonder how our heroes will escape the traps set by the Nazi's.  There is a lot of talking and there is also some suspenseful action in many episodes.  I got hooked on the series from the first episode.  I am hoping the BBC will make seasons 2 & 3 available for sale in the US soon.",1438473600,10,1203,4.483870967741935
3622375,5,B001H090FS,Compelling. Riveting. Can't pry myself away from the screen! You're on the edge of your seat because episodes don't necessarily have happy endings. The fact that the series is from the 1970s and isn't the highest quality video adds to a gritty realism and historic element. So glad I stumbled upon this gem.,1436400000,4,307,4.811320754716981
3622376,5,B001H090FS,"Such an engrossing series ages ago on PBS -- I watched the episodes every time they ran on PBS.  I have been searching for the DVD versions for Region 1 ever since DVD's were born, and they finally released Season 1 for us here in the States!  Thank you, Amazon, thank you, thank you, thank you for offering this item for sale.  I clicked ""BUY"" as soon as I found this entry.  I agree heartily with all the laudatory reviews for Secret Army, whether streaming, Region 1 or Region 2 versions, so I won't bother to duplicate what has already been written.  A simply outstanding series.  I can't wait until seasons 2 and 3 come out for Region 1.  (Whatever took them so long to release this series for Region 1 anyway?)",1436313600,12,716,4.378787878787879
8307542,5,B001H090FS,"Loved the series when it was on back in the '80's I think.  Very nice to have this available. We know a woman who was in the resistance and this is very true to what she experienced.  Please request they put the other episodes in the format that plays in the USA & Canada.

Thanks.",1505520000,,281,4.072727272727272
8307543,3,B001H090FS,"At first I really got into the series, but as each series ended I felt not just sad but that it made the pilots of the British army act stupid. Not all British fliers would have been so childish. The Jewish folks, it would have been nice to see some positive things, everything is negative. I hope it gets better.  Normally, I feel the gestapo would have been the upper person, everybody I start to like or wonder about just vanishes. I feel the guy who got killed as he was tired of the war was wrong , He was not a traitor , he had used up his inner reserves that would have made him stay strong. At least he tried.",1501545600,,617,4.057377049180328
8307544,2,B001H090FS,"Season 2 & 3 of this late 70's BBC series weren't released in the US ... and that should have been my big hint! Ignoring the writing on the wall I popped in disk 1 in and gave it a whirl ... it does after all have a promising plot.

This experiment lasted 1.5 episodes. Stagey and slow ... lots of film noir camera shots but no FN music ... bad acting ... and all those unrelenting close ups of peoples faces ... it makes one feel claustrophobic! This is not good TV compared to all that is available!!!

Really when you think about it most late 70's BBC shows were really bad and I remember having the same revulsion when I watched ""Enemy At The Door"" 20 years ago.",1494288000,,666,4.115384615384615
8307545,5,B001H090FS,Very well done. Can't wait for some more. Hard to find a place to stop.,1468800000,,71,3.8

8307548,5,B001H090FS,"for a person who enjoys WWII movies, this series is very good",1465689600,,61,4.166666666666667
8307549,3,B001H090FS,"As to be expected very ""seventies"" production, which, does not in the least influence my criticism. So, notwithstanding that, it is rather stilted in putting across the overall story-line. Halfway through I put it aside to perhaps watch on a rainy day - therefore, would not entirely write it off !!",1463616000,,299,4.882352941176471
8307550,5,B001H090FS,excellent - better than first review - wish this series was longer,1463184000,,66,4.583333333333333
8307551,3,B001H090FS,I wasn't sure if the stories were true. They were usually too sad.,1462752000,,66,4.153846153846154
