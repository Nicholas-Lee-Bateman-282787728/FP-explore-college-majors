8531544,1,B008WDTT72,"The product description said the DVD was Dolby 5.1. This DVD was only in stereo with no 5.1 option. I was extremely disappointed with this item, I read that there were so bogus disc copies out there and I guess I got one. This seller makes amazon look bad.",1384214400,,256,4.244897959183674
8531545,5,B008WDTT72,"If you're a fan of the Dan (and I am) this video will give you a great concert and an exposure to their dry sense of humor.  (They only have one between them.)  It was released in 2000 to promote their cd of the same name.  We see and hear fan interviews, radio interviews, Donald and Walter as mock interviewers of the current band throughout, but the real treat is the live music.  As always, they have assembled a group of studio stalwarts who make a tight ensemble and include several inspired soloists.  Guitarist Jon Herrington, saxists Cornelius Bumpus and Chris Potter in particular step out with solos that ignite the arrangements we fans have become maybe too familiar with.  One can also hardly ignore the trio of backing vocalists, Carolyn Leonhart, Victoria Cave and the effervescent Cynthia Calhoun, all three of whom are lovely to hear and to see.  The rhythm section of Ricky Lawson, drums, Tom Barney, bass and Ted Baker, piano do more than hold the whole thing together, they drive it. The song selections go as far back as ""Bad Sneakers"" from ""Katy Lied"" and as far forward as the ribald ""Cousin Dupree"" with the apparent emphasis on groove.  My particular favorite is ""Black Friday"" which features some spectacular guitar rides by Mr. Harrington.  But that's just me.  And the audience too, who were rocking out with preppy abandon.  Oh, and Donald and Walter do just fine, too.",1382486400,,1398,4.735537190082645
