I watched him race for years pulling off some amazing feats and maneuvers I'm sure that were captured on film yet I find no good compilation of them.  Anyone who reads this and knows of such a video please comment on this post.",1421798400,,342,4.483870967741935
8226407,5,B000X1ASXK,"It was a great DVD about Dale Earnhardt and loved the interviews. It's a great addition to the movie ""DALE"" and I also have the ""ESPN Sportscentury Greatest Athletes - Dale Earnhardt Jr."" DVD so I have them both which are both good additions to the NASCAR related DVDs I have. I just wish them both were longer, more like the length of a movie (at least 1 hour and 30 minutes) but the 45 minutes are good enough.",1286928000,,412,4.227848101265823
