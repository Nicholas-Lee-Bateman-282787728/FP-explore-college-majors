8591546,4,B00022PYS4,"I really anticipated this video because i love the RX7 and RX8. In this volume, they get a new RX8 and they show you it's strengths and weaknesses. I was surprised by some of it's weaknesses and for that, i consider BMI to have done quite a good job. I found the beginning to be a bit boring-- they are driving the RX8 a bit and relaying how it feels for driver comfort. But once they bring it to the Tsukuba Circuit and have it race against other cars, it picks up from there. This DVD has more than just the RX8 segments though, and is overall very entertaining, and really enjoyable to watch. I don't regret buying this product at all. These DVDs are the best for automotive enthusiasts.",1305504000,2,690,4.315384615384615
8591547,4,B00022PYS4,"Err...not quite.  The overwhelming concensus in the video concerns the RX-8's torque output-there is not much to speak of.  Otherwise, the viewer gets and in-depth discussion of what the RX-8 means to the sports-car segment, and how the genesis of the new rotary design allowed the engineers to sidestep the ever delicate emissions requirements.  Past rotary engines were notorious for their high emissions, poor gas mileage, and excessive oil consumption...well, at least the Mazda engineers got the first part right.  Takuya Kurosawa raves about the handling prowess of the RX-8, but echoes the sentiments of a lot of rotary fanatics (RX-7 fans in particular): the new car just doesn't have the sauce the outgoing RX-7 had with twin sequential turbos.  Nevertheless, this is a sportscar that the enthusiast should consider just on the recommemdations of the test drivers.  Takuya is a well-renowned race car driver(he is the son of Gan-San, Motoharu Kurosawa) and has the insight and input to intelligently critique a car and its shortcomings.  Rest assured, if they don't like something about a car, they will let you know about it.",1122422400,3,1135,5.169398907103825
