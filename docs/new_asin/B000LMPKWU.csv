4457515,1,B000LMPKWU,"Two Indian movies were ordered as a package deal.
Kati Patang was a fine quality print
Amar Prem was a very bad print. I was much disappointed,",1337472000,,143,4.333333333333333
4457516,5,B000LMPKWU,"this is a beautiful love story that challenges the ideals of what is and what is not proper when it comes to falling in love.  true love prevails in the most unexpected state... lovely!

the quality could be better but this is an old movie so no complaints.

all of the music and vocals will forever be engaged in your heart.",1292803200,3,325,4.295081967213115
4457536,1,B000LMPKWU,The volume is very low. It's better to watch on YouTube.,1418342400,,56,4.181818181818182
4457537,4,B000LMPKWU,The streaming stalled twice during the movie & it skipped frames after stalling for about 3-4 mins. But overall quality was good.,1403049600,,129,4.909090909090909
4457538,5,B000LMPKWU,this is a beautiful story of pure love and sacrifice for the sake of the one you love. The theme is an adult theme but there is nothing indecent in the movie.,1400457600,,158,3.96875
4457539,4,B000LMPKWU,"This one is GOOD, Ladies and Gents. If you don't have a warm sensation in your chest by the end, then I suggest you drink more hot beverages. The story is fairly standard: bad husband tosses devoted wife away for a younger woman, wife is gossiped about by hypocritical neighbors, and saved from suicide by ""old family friend"" who brings her to the big city, and ends up working in the local brothel. Of course, she falls in love with a client, and endures tragedy after tragedy, until the crescendo culminates into a bittersweet ending.

Like I said, standard 'Hooker with a heart of gold' stuff. So what makes it good? Complete genuineness! The characters feel like real people, the story makes you think, and while yes, it is a bit sanctimonious in places, there are lessons there that everyone should be reminded of once-in-a-while.

Sharmila Tangore (Mother of the uber-awesome Saif Ali Khan) OWNS this movie. Remake though it may be, I have no desire to see any other version. In a role that could easily become one-dimensional, she plays Pushpa with pulsating realness. You never see her as a hapless victim. While her circumstances lay largely beyond her control, she refuses to cow to them. She holds her head high come what may, refusing to relinquish her dignity, and sense of right.

Rajesh Khanna is one of those tragic examples of a superlative actor, but rather rotten human being. His Anand Babu skirts Devdas territory at first, but changes course to an almost Buddhist-like inner calm. Personally, I say that he took it a little too far, but better that extreme than the other. At least we got a nicer ending.

Vinod Mehra SHINES as Nandu. He doesn't do cloyingly sweet, or obnoxious brat, he balances both by being what he was, a little boy, but it doesn't feel like he's playing himself either. He's got great chemistry with both leads, and his sweet eyes make you melt. It's too bad he died so young.

All in all, definitely SEE THIS!",1396137600,,1954,4.685131195335277
4457540,5,B000LMPKWU,"I enjoyed the film and yes I would recommend it. Sharmila Tagore delivers a wonderful performance and Rajesh Khanna certainly needs no introduction. Both were Great!
