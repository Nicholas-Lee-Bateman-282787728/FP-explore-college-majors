8011123,4,B0001EFUVO,"These are some fairly decent interviews / documentaries relating to the horror movie industry.

One disc interviews some scream queens from classic b movies, who discuss their roles in the movies and discuss the movie industry, sometimes as it applies specifically to women. The other disc has parts 1 & 2 out of 4 from a documentary about folks that work in the horror industry. Actors, directors, a few writers, etc.

The interviews and comments are generally of interest to those who wantto know more about the horror industry. Topics and comments tend to range all over the place, but it's all interesting / relevant.

The documentaries feel a tiny bit dated, if only because they were made a number of years ago and thus don't cover a lot of newer films. Most of the films covered are low-budget ""indie"" flicks and the associated cast or crew or directors, and not so much big name folks like Craven, Carpenter, King, etc.",1276992000,2,927,4.745341614906832
