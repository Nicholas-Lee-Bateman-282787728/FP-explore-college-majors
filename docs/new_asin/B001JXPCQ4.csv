3662387,5,B001JXPCQ4,Over the years I have enjoyed all of Richard Simmon's dance/exercise videos.  This  most recent is fun........moves along well paced and just plain easy to follow.,1234137600,,163,5.230769230769231
3662388,3,B001JXPCQ4,"I ""thought"" it was a low-impact workout, since we are all growing older.  Richard was his high-energy self, but I failed to see how he has become slower (as I have).  I have all his other videos because I love to dance, but was a bit disappointed that it was the same fast tempo!",1233964800,3,279,4.148148148148148
3662389,5,B001JXPCQ4,This workout will get you going and you will have alot of fun doing it too. This DVD is very good and I would say get this one a try. And go ahead have some fun!,1233360000,,161,3.5
3662390,4,B001JXPCQ4,very good purchase. Richard simmons is stil Richard Simmons. Crazy and wild. Makes you sweat those pounds off.,1233273600,2,110,5.166666666666667
3662391,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I have other exercise videos, but I always come back to Richard Simmons.
I am a senior citizen with a bum knee and other health problems.  Exercising at least 30 minutes a day controls a great many health problems.

Richard's workouts are low impact and easy to follow and will not cause injury.  I am glad to see he is updating some of the videos.  He included a senior citizen in the video which sends the right message,  I have learned that exercising is critical to maintaining health at an advanced age.

I also have his 60's and 80's blast off videos which are just 30  minutes in length which I use on those days I can't do the 40 minutes.",1233014400,102,646,4.289256198347108
3662392,4,B001JXPCQ4,"when I checked out the songs listed and watched the video clip I thought it looked familiar and went through my Richard Simmon's collection.  Sure enought it is the same Supersweatin' Party off the Pounds produced in 2005.  Only the cover is a little different.  What a disapointment!  I was going to preorder it as I love Richard Simmons and he is promoting on TV he is now 60 and out there to help us take off that Holiday weight.
So a warning for all you fans that this is not new...and Richard I am disappointed that you only did a remake if you read this!",1230336000,16,560,4.254716981132075

3662414,3,B001JXPCQ4,I used to have these on VHS about 25-30 years ago and I loved them. I ordered this one since I had never done it particular one and it is not as fun as I remember it being. I have only done it twice and only about 4 of the songs. I wish I would have ordered what I had before.,1505865600,,276,3.540983606557377

3662419,4,B001JXPCQ4,"I agree with a few of the other reviewers that this is more intense than the original sweatin' workouts.  I really enjoyed and found the sweatin' with the oldies 2 workout fairly easy to follow.  The workouts here are a good bit more difficult to follow and faster transitions between moves.  I KNOW that I didn't do all the moves correctly because of how fast the workout is, but still feel I got a good workout...Just probably not as Richard intended.  Still glad I have it, but think I'll have to get a lot better at my other sweatin' workout before I feel like trying this one again.",1495584000,,587,4.407407407407407

3662434,5,B001JXPCQ4,"Great fun! I wouldn't however recommend it for beginners, though even a beginner could pick it up quickly. If you're just starting out, I recommend his H.O.P.E. program, then work up to this. High energy, nice mix of all sizes and shapes working out with him - it made me feel better.

It takes a couple times to get the hang of it, but once you got the steps down, you'll feel like a pro. I've never once had a bad experience with Richard Simmons workouts. I look forward to doing this the moment I wake up!",1473120000,,368,4.271428571428571

3662460,1,B001JXPCQ4,"I love the original Sweatin' to the Oldies, but this falls way short. The music is hard to hear,  the camera pans around too much and does not focus enough on what the moves are supposed to be. There are these annoying little girls twirling ribbons around. That is distracting and unnecessary. It's like a bad home movie. I did not care for the music selection, mostly because I could barely hear it. Stick to regular Richard.",1458345600,,426,4.532467532467533
3662461,2,B001JXPCQ4,Did not care for this exercise DVD. Not much explanation. Tried to return this but buyer would not take return because he said it was open. Well the only way you can see if you like this or not was to play it!,1456876800,,209,3.883720930232558
3662462,5,B001JXPCQ4,"Surprisingly, I really liked this video. Usually Richard's videos are not as good when they are not his ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" videos,but this one has great dance moves and is lots of fun like the originals, and even has an entire mall as a backdrop! Personally, I'm not quite as pleased with the music choice, but if you are a child of the 80s you'll probably enjoy it. Its not an easy video if you've never done any of his videos before, but all it takes is a little practice, and Richard does call out the moves frequently which he ordinarily doesn't do. I'm a big fan of Richard Simmons for helping to make exercise fun and not just for people already in shape. I would definitely recommend.",1456704000,,697,4.410852713178294
3662473,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I really liked this workout.  It was a little more intense than Richard Simmons' beginner collection - Sweatin' to the Oldies, so if you are just beginning to work out, I would recommend doing the Sweatin to the Oldies DVD's first, then do this one.",1456012800,,249,4.533333333333333
3662474,5,B001JXPCQ4,This was actually fun. I almost enjoyed working out,1455148800,,51,4.777777777777778
3662475,4,B001JXPCQ4,It's a very good work out video. A little hard to figure out an keep up with for first timers. But he says several times it's okay to do what you can that you'll get it in time which is encouraging. He tells you what is coming up which helps some.,1454198400,,247,3.8627450980392157
3662476,5,B001JXPCQ4,"Richard's videos are the best fun wise! Low impact, but you work up a sweat. His choice of music is the best, too! I have all 4 Sweatin to the Oldies, which are 60's music. This one is 80's music, with really fun songs. I was a kid in the 60's and my kids were kids in the 80's so its a trip down memory lane whenever I do aerobics with Richard Simmons. Like the Sweatin videos there are all ages and sizes of people. At the end it is very inspiring because they tell how much weight they have lost. His exercises are the best when you really don't feel like exercising...Its more of a party. No dread factor. I personally know they work if its weight you want to lose, because I lost 35lbs. doing these videos back in VHS days. I told someone at work I still do Richard Simmons, besides Zumba, and they snorted at me...(A young person.) Don't knock it til you've tried it.",1451260800,4,873,4.171597633136095
3662477,2,B001JXPCQ4,"There is next to no warm up.  There are no directions on how to move safely.  There are constant move changes without warning.
This is very frustrating.  It is the only dvd out of 6 that I have tried thus far that I ran out of room with the constant change in direction.
The ONLY thing I liked about it was the retro music.  Simmons is constantly joking and it is corny... SKIP this one..

Here are 3 other dvds that I recommend instead...
Walk away the pounds, 20 minute Power Mile.  This is excellent for out of shape beginners.  I use it as a warm up to other videos.
Walk on to Weight Loss,  Walking Pilates.  Also excellent.  It is a 3.5 mile / 50 minute work out.  BOTH of these videos provide excellent form and safety tips.
For an ab workout,  Dance off the inches TUMMY TONE PARTY ZONE with Marie Forleo... NOT OTHER Dance off the inches videos.  This instructor repeats the same moves over and over so that you can catch on in one to two attempts at the video.  The warm up is not good in this video,  but with the WALK AWAY the POUNDS video for 15 minutes,  you can get an excellent warm up before moving on to this  39 minute,",1450828800,,1138,4.146788990825688

3662481,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I purchased this so long ago that I've worn it out and need to get a new one.  I read some of the reviews here, and I want to tell you that I was overwhelmed with all the steps in the beginning too, but if you practice it just 3 times, you'll find that the music ques you as you progress, and soon you'll be able to do it with your eyes closed, although I don't recommend that, you could trip over the dog! ... This is the DVD I keep coming back to, because it has everything you need in it, and it's fun.  You should keep the remote handy and pause it to drink water and catch your breath when you feel that you need to, but not for too long, because you don't want to lose you're momentum.  I also use the Wii fitness program to track progress, it will measure your BMI and keep track of your weight.

3662496,5,B001JXPCQ4,"This a my very favorite Richard DVD. I have several exercise dvds of his and others and I always go back to this one. It makes me feel good because of the music and the setting and of course Richard's personality. I would prefer intermediate to advanced workouts so I add hand weight gloves and sometimes leg weights when using his dvd's. It is nice to see different body shapes in his workouts. I cannot stand dvds with perfect bodies that people are born with and that don't have a clue about what it's like to need to lose weight. There is no motivation there for me watching people like that. Put people on there that have lost weight because they had to work at it, that is inspirational for sure. I hope Richard continues to create new dvds. Thanks Richard for being true to those of us who need your support.",1443052800,,815,4.368421052631579

3662514,4,B001JXPCQ4,Mixed feelings about this video. It is made for beginners but the pace about gave me a heart attack! You can go at your own pace but I ended up going for yoga. I love Richard and liked that he had a lot of overweight middle aged women dancing their hearts out with the rest. The dancers look like average moms. not skinny actresses.,1438819200,,332,4.203125

3662533,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I practically wrote a book in my review of Sweatin to the Oldies so I'll try to make this quick. My mom (51) and I (30) work out to this video.  It's a lot tougher than Sweatin to the Oldies but only because for the two of us each video seemed to target certain but different parts of our body. I started at 365 and my mom at 230. Four weeks later I'm 350 and my mom is 220.

We exercise everyday. It's fun, the music is good and we like seeing all the smiling people. At first we didn't finish the entire video and now we're at two videos a day. We ordered a fourth video so that we don't have to do our third video both days but we don't plan to go beyond that. Our moves are still not perfect or graceful but it's all good if we're moving. Once the video started to seem short to us we added the second video. Once we're used to working out with two videos we're going to add weights. Only one pound at a time. Slow and steady wins makes it to the end of the race without having a hard rebound. ",1430697600,,998,3.9064039408866993

Definitely took me a bit longer to learn this one, but I'm sweating like a pig when I finish it. Guess that means it's working!",1425513600,3,393,4.116883116883117

3662552,4,B001JXPCQ4,"This is a typical Richard Simmons work out. Not sure what everyone is talking about that it's difficult. It's a ""work-out"". It's suppose to be difficult or it would be called a ""stroll in the park""!  It's like anything else, the first few times your a little lost but then you get the hang of it. But you know it's not a contest. No points off if you move the wrong way. As long as your moving you're heading in the right direction.
1 point off because the music is very low on this tape. I thought it might have been the tape I got, but I see someone else mentioned it as well. I like my music really loud when I work out & this won't go that loud. Also 1 point off for that annoying skinny girl who is in most of the shots. Obviously the camera-man's girl friend. lol
Other than that I really enjoy his workouts.",1422230400,3,814,4.0875

When I was younger I did a VHS tape of his that my mom ordered that was similar and also had 80s music that I loved doing...and this reminded me of it! Not only was it fun, it was a good workout.

3662584,3,B001JXPCQ4,"I've been doing this workout for about a year now. At first I liked it, mostly because it was new to my workout queue. However, I like it less and less and have moved it back to my ""only use sometimes"" area.

I am aware that I will be one of the few who doesn't like this DVD. But if we all liked everything the same, there would be no reason for new DVD's to be made!

The movements are super quick and jerky. (I'm comparing this to my favorites, Oldies #3, #4 , #5 and Disco Sweat) Songs a much faster, and there are not enough prompts, so that I end up in the wrong place to be doing the movements. Like at the back of the room, or right under the ceiling fan. I find the people in costumes totally distracting to the workout, but after a while I was pretty much able to ignore them.

Today, when it got to the song with the dudes in the ice cream parlor, I just gave it up and put the DVD away.

 I've been doing Richards Work outs for over 20 years. His are the only ones that I do because he uses normal people, they're fun and the music is enjoyable. No matter how often I do these DVD's I always find something new to make me smile, like someone socks that don't match or some expression on a face. However, this one for me is more stressful and less fun.",1416268800,2,1263,3.9762845849802373

I'm a 20 year old woman and I bought this DVD because I think Richard Simmons is SO fun. He is so sweet and positive, and I love the 80s music too. The work-out is quite fast-paced, in my opinion, but the moves aren't very difficult. It is great cardio (there is almost no strength or muscle work). I am quite unfit so this is an amazing workout for me. I can do about 20-25 minutes before I'm too tired, but I am building my way up! At first it can be a little hard to follow, but each time you do the routines it becomes easier. It's like learning a dance! I did take one star off because I wish the music was a little bit louder and also maybe that the routines were slightly easier to follow.

3662624,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I was in a really tough yet effective tabatas/boxing/weights style training program and lost weight but ended up hurting my knees and aggravating my already touchy hip.  Since then, I packed on about 20+ additional pounds over my already overweight self.  I took off 8 pounds doing keto for a month, then I added back in the carbs and started using my exercise bike on uphill climbs to build muscle.  I fell on ice and hurt my hip again, so I got this thinking hey it will be easy just to move around a little.  I was expecting about a 200 calorie burn on my Polar monitor, but it was a whopping 510 calories and I was doing 86% of my max heart rate on average.  I weigh about 170 and I'm 5'4"".  I was sweating a LOT but it sure was FUN!!!  Of course, your calorie burn may vary based on your weight and how much effort you put into the dancing.  I was trying to learn the moves so I was all over the place effort-wise.  I like this much better than Jillian, Jackie, etc.  Richard Simmons always has that positive love which is so refreshing.  It is also great to see people of all sizes dancing and having fun.  That is also missing in modern workout DVDs.  My daughter also had a great time doing this with me.  I'm going to do the Sweatin to the Oldies dvd next time and see how much that burns.",1388966400,12,1298,4.160642570281125

There are different routines for each song so you have to learn them in order to enjoy the workout.  We did this tape for about 3 days and lost interest because the routines weren't intuitive enough to catch on quickly.  It was pretty cheesy too, so my kids didn't want to join in.  Richard S. has a heart of gold and you have to love a man who obviously cares so much for overweight people.

Richard is very motivational throughout the whole workout and encourages staying hydrated and checking yourself to make sure you are not tiring out. If you are looking for a fun, positive but butt-kicking aerobic workout then this is it. I love that he makes you feel like he is right there working out with you.

I have gotten bored to tears with just about all my other workout dvds. I have tried many exercise dvd's.  All of Richard's dvds I have tried are great.  This one uses 80's music and he seems to bump it up a notch (it's one of the newer dvd's) in parts. It is a very good workout.  I have worked out for years so I am not a couch potato.  This is a fun indoor dvd for a change.  I don't stop and wonder how much longer is left in this one like I did with a very popular walking instructor (and I had a bunch of hers, too).

The people who said that the DVD is too fast must be just starting their fitness journey because I would say the pace verges on slow. If you're someone who struggles with new choreography, watch the video first, or just know that it won't make you sweat the first time through. It's similar moves to his other videos. Also, anyone with shoulder or back problems should be seeing a doctor before beginning any workout routine and your limitations are just that- your limitations. I don't think that it's a flaw to the DVD that someone out there can't do every move unmodified.

She lost the weight (20 pounds) gained back her muscle mass and her energy in just 4 weeks doing the routines lightly 2 times per day with a healthful diet. My teenage daughter and I have joined in with her 4 times per week for only 20 minutes. We are both very petite but suffer from chronic neck and back pain. Well Richard cured that!!! We feel terrific. If we skip a few days we notice a tremendous difference. It's a goofy video and we look crazy but that makes it fun. Laughter is the best medicine.

The only thing I cannot stand is the blond in the pink shorts who acts all cheesy staring at the camera like she is auditioning for a better gig somewhere. It is almost enough to make you gag. I think the people need to be happy and entertaining but no one smiles this much while working out it looks like her face might break she smiles so much. It seems like she absolutely tries to steal the show and it drives you crazy!!!When she is on the sidelines she looks like she wants to jump in and take over. It is really hard to focus on Richard because your attention is pulled to her. Buy the video it is fun but you too will become obsessed with the girl in the pink shorts!!!!!

3662722,5,B001JXPCQ4,"As a user of the first 4 Sweatin and a girl whose parents ALWAYS played 60's music I was scared to try ANYTHING except what I already knew. Even my own generations music.

After ALOT of thought I decided to order Party Off The Pounds. And it is the BEST thing I EVER did. Dancing to my parents music is fun. My own music. 10 times as good. I love all the music. It is hard to decide my favorite. Is it Like A Virgin with the older gentleman who at first distracted me? A man in his 70's (?) dancing to it? Shake it up with the 2 busboys who Richard first looks weirded out they started dancing but turn out to be totally hot? Or New Attitude that I think of how it fits me so well being 80's lighter.

PROS:
The music is Awesome. The dancers wonderful. (There is a woman in orange who looks like she has a bad wig on though) Richard encouragment on this one is the best I have heard yet. The dancers don't distact. Not loud like on some of his other DVD'S. Some of the moves are kinda hard but you catch on after a few times. Do as Richard recommends and watch it through 1 time at least. I was able to jump right in and get a good workout. Sweat first time through

CONS:
  Only 1 that always stands out in my head. The opening is kinda cheesy. Drives me crazy when he kinda blast outta the TV. I wish that Dance your pants off was on DVD which is also 80's music

Richard is the only DVD'S I have due to the fact that he uses bigger people. I will never be a size 2. I want a party. I want to forget what I am doing is work. Richard provides that. I laugh my way through his workouts.",1346112000,3,1586,3.925233644859813

To be honest, if you're new to aerobics, you'll be worn out in ten minutes, but watching the screen and they're still working it. Talk about motivation! The end shows each and how much weight they lost which is also motivational.

Like others mentioned, I appreciate that he had people of different shapes and sizes in his video.  I found this work-out to be very entertaining.

Let me start off by saying that I love dancing, even though I am not graceful and I'm quite out of shape. I was looking for a video that would be fun, but wouldn't have terribly complicated dance steps (I purchased a Dancing With the Stars exercise video previously, and that was a complete waste of money for me). The steps in this video are pretty simple, but I found that it took me a little practice. Of course, for the most part these are cardio exercises I wouldn't use on the actual dance floor. But still, it's kind of like dancing.

I really like that the backup dancers in the video are not all size 2, there is a wide variety. One woman was quite overweight. I feel that this video would be good for people who need to lose weight.

Richard Simmons is kind of a weird and silly guy, but he's also really encouraging and positive.

Did I mention the video is filmed in a pretend mall? Lol.",1345075200,5,1065,4.180487804878049

Then I found MEGA MIX BLAST-OFF in my garage, started doing it and loved it, and went hunting for more. This one is MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE!!! To me, the best workouts have a lot of high-energy, hummable music, good cueing, and great dance moves. This has them all.

The music is from the '80's, so it's familiar (and the songs stay in my head long after the workout). The workout routine itself is full of big dance moves and really gets you to sweat! If you're familiar with other Richard Simmons workouts, you'll recognize a lot of the moves, though there are a few new ones here. And he has a good stretch, warm-up and cooldown, so you protect your joints and muscles. I find myself popping in the video even when I don't have time to do the whole workout -- I do one or two of my favorite songs and STILL work up a good sweat! (And it makes you feel GREAT doing it!)

I've read reviews stating that is was hard on you if you have a bad back and I haven't found that to be the case.  I don't know if it would be the first DVD that I would use if I hadn't exercised for a while, maybe start with one of the Dancin' with the Oldies DVD's.

3662734,4,B001JXPCQ4,"I recently began an effort to add a lot more physical activity to my daily routine and purchased this DVD in hopes of mentally (physically?) preparing myself to attend the group classes at my gym.  I found this title to be appealing because I am a fan of Richard Simmons, because I've used his tapes briefly in the distant past, and because I felt like this would be more at the level of something I could actually do.  Some of the 80's music that is featured on this workout was also a selling point.

I was surprised I could do the entire workout (50min) without pausing to do more than grab a sip of water. It did however get my heartrate up and cause me to break a sweat.  Unless I remember wrong, the Broadway workout was more challenging even though I was 10yrs younger and in better shape.  I think it will take a bit of practice to learn all of the moves they do as it's nonstop without instruction and I am not a person blessed with gracefulness. I wasn't pleased with the remixes of the music featured in the video although it must have been necessary to maintain the tempo.

All in all I am pleased with it and will continue to rotate this in with my exercise routine.  I wouldn't lie and say I had the greatest time working out to this video and I never expected to.  It was however tolerable and the time went by faster than I expected.",1331942400,2,1349,4.262745098039216
3662735,5,B001JXPCQ4,"When I returned to regular exercising about 6 years ago, I started out with Richard Simmons because I knew he specialized in exercises that were safe and effective for people of all size and age.  What I didn't realize is just how much fun he makes it.

As I got a bit more advanced in my level of fitness, I started to ""cheat"" on Richard, but he's never entirely left my rotation of a HUGE collection of exercise DVD's.  His ""Blast and Tone"" and ""Tone and Sweat"" are great routines for sculpting.  Among my routines is Kathy Smith, The Firm, Erin O'Brien, Leslie Sansone and others.

What I have found is that you just simply can't beat Richard for a good cardio workout that won't be so strenuous that you'll ask your family to stand by to administer CPR. I haven't used this video in quite some time and had forgotten how much fun it is and how fast the time goes by.  Many of the moves are those used in some of his previous DVD's.  This is not a criticism, as the routines to each song are altogether new and fresh.  I tend to put off using a new video or one I haven't used in a while because there is always a learning curve.  So if you've done any of his other routines, you may find this one easier to master, as I did.  These routines can be geared to your level of fitness.  If you have limitations, you can tone down your gestures, and as you advance - or if you're more advanced, you can throw yourself into the movements with a little more abandon.  I can say that I've never hurt myself doing a Richard Simmons routine.  Like all the others, you get a warm up and cool down stretch.

As I've said in other reviews, if you really pay attention to what you're doing in the dances, you'll discover that you're doing a low impact version of many standard or classic exercises - but he makes it so much fun that you don't notice.  I ended sweaty but energized and in good spirits and I don't think it gets much better than that.  The man is pure magic - he makes exercise time disappear in a flash!!  If 45 minutes is a bit too long for you, I recommend all of the routines in the Blast Off series, which are 30 minutes in length.",1327104000,,2140,4.193154034229829

Since I use it, to Richard Simmons, himself: Thank you very much, for creating this great workout DVD, and I enjoy doing them workouts.

One thing is great is he does ask after two or three songs if we feel thirsty, and reminds us to drink plenty of water before, during, and after the workout.  He's right.  Some can dehydrate badly if they don't drink water when using his workout programs, along with any other workout videos.  Especially Aerobics.

I did it this morning because the heat wave is so intense I didn't want to over-exert myself with a more challenging workout. Richard is a good leader, but there aren't many instructions for those who are newbies to aerobics. With that said, this DVD isn't brain surgery and it should be easy to catch on within a few workouts. The most difficult thing for me is that it requires a fair amount of space. I find myself either turning to fit into the room to do the exercise or modifying a move altogether so I don't have to use up so much space.

3662748,4,B001JXPCQ4,"This workout is a ton of fun, and I actually think that the remade versions of the songs are great since the songs are sped up and made longer. They basically sound like club versions of classic songs.

This workout is really high-energy--much more so than other Richard Simmons tapes. I was really surprised at how hard I found it at first, so if you are pretty out of shape and just getting back into exercising, this might not be the best starting point. On the upside, it is easy to skip songs if you find that you can't or don't want to do the whole DVD at once, and Richard is his usual positive, motivational self. He keeps reminding you that it's ok to modify things, and that you should just do the best you can.

Once you learn the routines, they are fun and you will probably find yourself actually looking forward to exercising--a great selling point in an exercise DVD, of course!

The workout is entirely aerobic, so you might want to supplement the DVD or choose another one if you are more interested in toning exercises. If you want to focus on aerobics and do just a little toning, I recommend Disco Sweat over this DVD because there is some standing leg work and an abdominal segment at the end of Disco Sweat.",1298419200,24,1229,4.405286343612334

I just finished this workout for the second time. Several friends got together for a dance party, and two of us gave it a test drive last night. First, you need to know that the pace is fast. If you get crabby when you are unable to follow choreography, you may want to think twice. The second time through I was still flailing all over the place. If you are concerned about looking good/smooth, take that into consideration. The songs, Mickey, New Attitude, Hit Me With Your Best Shot, etc. are not the original artists. The participants are all sizes and act happy to be there. Richard. Well, Richard has a sequin-encrusted heart. He is the all-time cheerleader.

The Dance party we had included several ages and fitness levels. Two of the younger girls are avid athletes and they had a blast and broke a sweat. Some of the older girls appreciated the low-impact aspects. All decided they'd like to add this to their fitness routine and would like to try more of Simmon's videos.

This DVD has a lot of familiar 80's songs, but they're not from the original artists, a LOT faster, and much longer so they make good workout songs.

And as always, Richard is as feminine as one could act, but he's also very encouraging on the DVD, saying ""you can do this"" ""just do your best"" and he even says ""I love you""... a little disingenuous for sure, but hey, I know he does love people who work hard to lose weight and get in shape.

I gave it four stars out of five because the video quality is ten times better than the first video he put on DVD, and the songs are more from my generation, and the fact that this DVD makes you work MUCH harder and is a more advanced workout.

It lost a star because of the girls with too much makeup and tight dresses he gets to dance around him in two of the songs.",1252713600,7,1033,3.975845410628019
3662760,5,B001JXPCQ4,It is so nice to find and purchase (at a reasonable rate) just what you are looking for!  Thank you!  I am enjoying my purchase.,1249862400,,128,4.08
3662761,2,B001JXPCQ4,"This is a warning to those with any type of shoulder issue. You will need to modify most of the moves in this exercise DVD. There are a LOT of over-the-head, fast motions and overhead arm swaying. I agree with the reviewer who stated you could put on any fast music CD and dance to it, but it was a fun distraction to watch Richard and the gang. It was hard to follow, very fast-paced, but for a first-time run-through, I was able to follow some of the moves. Also, if you have any back problems, be careful of the twists. Overall, I probably would not recommend it.",1248739200,7,566,4.25
3662771,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I needed to find an aerobic workout that would keep me entertained and allow me to have fun in the process.  Richard Simmons is very excentric... but he knows how to get you sweatin'!  By the time it got to the 'Shake it Up' song I was dancing around like a moron, having a blast and sweating like crazy.  With the familiar 80's flair of bright colors and pointless actors there is no denying that it is a Richard Simmons work out.  I've had it for 3 weeks now and feel that it is the best work out I could've chosen to get me excited about exercising again.  Great motivation for people just starting out, it'll keep you amused and give you a great workout all at the same time.  I highly recommend this DVD!!!",1240963200,13,711,4.229629629629629
3662772,5,B001JXPCQ4,"FUN, I have never bought a Richard Simmons video before.  The workout was easy and fun.  I wish it was longer.  Only lasted about 30 minutes.  I like to do at least 45 minutes cardio.",1240790400,,183,4.142857142857143
3662773,5,B001JXPCQ4,This is the first Richard Simmons DVD I've ever purchased and I absolutely love it! It's very fun and energetic and keeps you interested throughout the entire workout. After 3 weeks with the DVD I'm already seeing slight results which is huge motivation to continue the use.,1240012800,3,274,4.851063829787234
3662774,3,B001JXPCQ4,"I love Richard, but this is much too difficult to follow.  He doesn't explain the steps first, so I am lost.  I may try it again someday, but for now I will stick with my ""Walk Away the Pounds"".",1237766400,,194,3.948717948717949
3662775,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I've been into physical fitness for years, have amassed many tapes & DVD's, including Tae Bo, etc. yet I found Richard's DVD the MOST fun of any.

The production is great--staged in a ""mall"", with the gang behind Richard  a wonderful cross-section of shapes, sizes, & ages.  I found Richard's cueing more than adequate, tho it takes a few tries to learn the routine.

The first time I tried this routine I couldn't get past the first 2 songs, but after a week or so I completed the whole thing.  It's a hoot to do & u don't need much floorspace to do it either.  Richard's upbeat attitude is infectious & 50 mins fly by while u really SWEAT.

It's easy to skip songs w/ DVD format, just do the ones u want.
I am 56 years old & highly recommend this for ""Boomers"" & others.",1236643200,80,772,4.2465753424657535
3662776,5,B001JXPCQ4,"As most people who remember the 80's, I thought Richard Simmons was crazy. I bought one of his Sweating to the Oldies videos about 6 weeks ago with some reluctance but I figured it would be easier to workout to a video that shows people my size and bigger instead of the other videos I have tried where everyone looks like they need a sandwich. I loved the video so much since then I have bought two more. This Party Off the Pounds is my favorite. It is fast pace and after you are finished (even the first couple of times when you are just flailing around trying to keep up with Richard and figure out what his next move is) you know you have had a work out. I recommend this video to anyone who is serious about keeping up with an exercise routine. It is fun and energetic.",1236643200,73,775,4.173333333333333
3662777,3,B001JXPCQ4,"Well presented, but hard to follow if you haven't practiced the steps.  Best to use the pause button on occasion!  He has everyone represented...skinny folks to fat folks just danc'n away....very fun.  Have lots of room to do the dancing.",1236384000,8,238,4.9
3662778,5,B001JXPCQ4,Excellent DVD - but repackaged so if you bought a Party off the Pounds last year it is the same one - just a new look.,1234828800,2,118,3.576923076923077
3662779,1,B001JXPCQ4,Didn't care for it at all.  You can put your favorite music on and dance away.  Not worth the price.,1234656000,,100,3.95
3662780,3,B001JXPCQ4,This was ok. I was expecting these songs with original artists but the moves were pretty easy to follow.,1234396800,,104,4.526315789473684

8314044,5,B001JXPCQ4,"I started doing Richard Simmons workouts as a bit of a joke, remembering him as a child of the 80s, and I completely fell in love with his workouts.  Richard is super positive, fit, confident, and motivating.  Throughout this video, he continues to motivate and tell you that it's okay if you don't get it, and just do your best!  He's fun and a little goofy, but that makes the video way more fun!

This one is more fast-paced than the Sweatin to the Oldies videos, but with much better music.  It was hard to catch on at first, but now that I'm a few runs through, I've *almost* got it down...but who cares, really?  Richard is all about getting up and moving, even if you're not perfect.  I love the ""New Attitude"" hip swinging cool-down the best!",1515110400,3,750,4.391304347826087
