7953138,3,B00005S6KM,It had potential but they had to throw zombies in it.  That just ruined it for me.  I was hoping it would be as good as Shaolin Vs Lama since it starred Alexander Lou.,1344211200,,167,3.8823529411764706
7953139,3,B00005S6KM,"If you're looking for ninjas, you'll love the opening credits... and not much else. The movie opens with a Shaolin monk being randomly attacked in the forest by a team of ninjas. Not a bad way for any movie to start! Following this attack, the ninjas disappear. For the rest of the movie.
What can I say? The acting and dialogue through which the viewer must drudge in order to get from fight scene to fight scene is horrible and awkward, but what Kung Fu movie fanatic hasn't paid their dues in this respect? The problem with this movie is that the the dialogue/acting are worse even than one might expect. It gets to the point where it's distracting, you know? Also, I think the male lead... MIGHT have down syndrome... Nothing wrong with that, of course. It's just a little surprising to see in a Kung Fu movie.
Still, the fight scenes themselves are fairly well done. The choreography doesn't quite stand out, but the enemies against which the Shaolin brothers are pitted, including ghost-and-zombie type dealies as well as masked attackers, make for some colorful fights.

In summary:
Don't get too excited about the ninjas, it's a trick. Skip past anything that isn't a fight. Make your own story!",1249776000,,1203,4.701421800947867
7953140,4,B00005S6KM,this movie got so much good raw kung fu action on it plus with great swordfighting.  You will only see 2 scenes of ninjas on action so don't be expecting much about more ninja action.  The only complaint i have is one of monk brothers who gets real cheesy that gets annoying but other than that if you could pass beyond him everything else fine.  one of the highlights of this movie is when the monks fought againts an unknown group of masked warriors that brought a twist of the story....highly recommended for people who likes raw kung fu flicks....,1168560000,,551,4.49
