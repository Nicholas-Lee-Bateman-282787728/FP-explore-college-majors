3544807,1,B001E0KSAM,"This is a typical ""skeptical"" view of global warming.  It does not reflect the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community, yet claims to be scientific in its approach.  It does not appear to appreciate what the enterprise of science really is: the contributions of tens of thousands of scientists looking at an extremely complex phenomenon, and attempting to connect the dots.  Science is not the selective collection of contrary information with a predetermined point to be made.  Science, especially in the case of global warming, is slugging through hundreds of thousands of observations, placing them together through as objective a process as is possible, and coming to a conclusion that can be applied to the real world.

When the topic is as important as climate change, it is important to distort one's findings as little as possible.  Coming at the topic with an ideological predisposition, as is done here, is not only bad science, but it can lead to unimaginable and unacceptable consequences for the future of our planet.",1235779200,17,1041,5.1301775147929
3544808,5,B001E0KSAM,"This DVD is a thorough, clear and thoughtful representation of a real ""hot button"" political issue of our day.  It was so refreshing to view a balanced, scholarly presentation that was not political in nature.  Today it is so easy to get caught up in the politics of issues like ""global warming"" and become overly emotional, failing to glean an overall understanding of the consequences of our views, as well as of our actions.  Thank you for the breath of fresh air in an environment of toxic, agenda-based rhetoric when it comes to ""global warming"".",1222128000,15,551,4.778947368421052
3544809,5,B001E0KSAM,"If global warming is important to you, then you have to view this documentary. It presented many scientific facts that I had not heard anywhere else. For example, the ocean releases massive amounts of CO2 when heated (much like a carbonated soda releases gas when heated). Therefore, measuring the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere doesn't necessarily mean that CO2 is causing the warming. My eyes were opened to the fact that many different factors could be the cause of global warming, not just man-made CO2 emissions. I was also shocked to see how anti-global warming efforts could be costing the lives of millions of the most disadvantaged people on the planet by discouraging their access to plentiful energy. All of the ""hot topics"" are discussed including polar bear populations, CO2 emissions, sea levels, solar flares, and more. If you believe mankind should be a responsible steward of the Earth, then I highly recommend that you add this DVD to your knowledge base.",1222041600,21,974,4.9815950920245395
3544810,5,B001E0KSAM,I had always heard that it may not be CO2 emmisions that have raised the earth's temperature but sunspots.  This DVD confirmed my suspicions and gave information in a more balanced approach than what I read in the newspapers.,1221436800,16,225,4.769230769230769
3544811,5,B001E0KSAM,"Millions of lives are at stake, especially in Africa. So is the economic stability of the world's most generous nation, the USA. This documentary combines interviews of highly qualified scientists--including PhD climatologists, PhD astrophysicist, PhD chemist, ecomomist and others--with footage from Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" to show that signing onto the Kyoto Protocol is highly likely to HURT the poverty sticken and starving people who so desperately need the energy that Al Gore's radical environmentalist ideas would continue to withhold from them. Republicans and Democrats and ALL political backgrounds need to see and share this DVD.",1220054400,28,687,5.745098039215686
8295845,5,B001E0KSAM,Very good read. More people should know the truth behind the climate change hoax.,1509840000,,81,4.857142857142857
8295846,4,B001E0KSAM,It was okay. It simply reinforced something I already believed. I did like it. I wish it was longer. I recommend it for those who do not agree with man made climate change. Climate change is real but not the way earth worshipers claim it to be.,1363910400,,244,4.212765957446808
8295847,1,B001E0KSAM,"So by the end of the video we basically have some bible thumper telling us we should be cautious but not too worried since god made things well and made sure it's all balanced. So why did got invent malaria then in the first effing place? And why all the concern about the DDT ban that stoppe the fight against malaria...why be such a malarie alarmis, since god will just take care of it all.",1351209600,7,392,4.24
8295848,5,B001E0KSAM,I thoroughly enjoyed this film...it has revealed a lot of new and insightful information the lamestream media will not provide you.,1309305600,2,131,5.285714285714286
8295849,1,B001E0KSAM,"oh dear me. is this seriously what people think is science? this is a wolf in pantomine sheep's clothing. possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen.

there is so much i could say about it. firstly, the contributors. roughly half of them work for organisations funded by exxon-mobil. hmm, suspect. christy and spencer are notoriously bad scientists. the others are effectively young earth creationists. to be a YEC you have to deny most of the scientific world [...]. therefore, they have absolutely no right to deny climate science from a scientific basis. they are methodologically flawed. they are also presuppositionally opposed to climate AGW based on received biblical beliefs. therefore, anything they say should be treated as highly dubious.

take the comments on polar bears actually increasing in number. they fail to see that in 1973 hunting laws meant that their numbers shot up massively, whilst still losing their habitat. their numbers are now heavily reduced, and they are endangered. [...]

almost every one of these guys is not in a good enough position, scientifically, to be able to make informed conclusions.

and the content. that's the funniest part. there is no science. they actually provide nothing. not a drop. only opinions and denial of other scientific positions. the sad thing is, people buy this, intellectually. they believe it, because it backs up their prejudged ideals. i could go on refuting every one of their points individually, but i have better things to do.

it's complete tripe. tripe. tripe. never, ever, ever buy this.

(PS the links have been replaced by parentheses and ellipses - suffice it to say I can back up the claims with real evidence!)",1293840000,21,1697,5.064516129032258
8295850,1,B001E0KSAM,"As an evangelical Christian and a scientist, I was alternately shocked, horrified, disgusted, infuriated, and ultimately ashamed as I watched this video. I am not sure how I made it to the end, but I did.

As someone intimately familiar with the science presented here--more so than some of the 'experts' they interview here--I can say with confidence that this video contains no more than a mis-mash of half-truths, lies, and red herrings.

As Christians I believe we have a commitment to truth in every aspect of our lives, even if it may appear to be in conflict with our personal opinions on politics. In making this video, the Answers in Genesis Institute and the people who appear in it have crossed far over that line; and if they are not ashamed of themselves--well, I am, on their behalf. What a witness to the world this is. With major relief organizations already struggling to cope with the effects of climate change on the dispossessed worldwide, the time to mistake political positions for Christ's teachings and hence justify the deliberate muddying of the waters on climate science has long past.

For those who are interested, much more balanced and well-informed perspectives on faith and the environment are available from organizations such as the National Association of Evangelicals and World Vision.",1289433600,17,1322,5.027397260273973
8295851,1,B001E0KSAM,"First, I can not stand Al Gore's movie... the science he states is mostly correct, but distorted.
Second, I can not stand any other politically motivated movie to counter Gore's movie, which this one is.

If one wants to watch an unbiased explanation, based solely on SCIENCE, then see the History Channel's ""A Global Warning?"".  Pure science, that explains past global climates, the evidence used to find these past climates, and how these past climates are the used to create future climate models.  The amount of information in the History Channel's movie, dwarfs the amount of information given here.

Understanding global warming does not mean someone is succumbing to the ""liberals""... I fought in Iraq, and my degree is in Geology.  I'm far from left-wing, but when pure science shows the way... it doesn't look good for us humans.

Remember, oil/coal comes from buried plant material... plant material that took CO2 out of the air a very long time ago... we are only replacing it, but the World's system's will need to balance themselves... can we handle a small temperature change, and anyone with doubts can watch ""Little Ice Age, Big Chill"" by the History Channel, that shows how the plagues (including the bubonic), mass (and multiple) famines wiped out the European population by only a temperature difference of 2-4 degrees.

The real concern is for another Permian extinction... why wait holding a match in a room that most people believe has natural gas leak in it?",1275264000,11,1481,4.97165991902834
8295852,1,B001E0KSAM,"Regardless of how ""engaging"" this ""documentary"" attempts to be, it is, quite possibly, the dumbest argument I've heard from those who want to debunk global warming. A total, and I mean TOTAL, attack on human intelligence and cognitive ability. I actually googled it twenty minutes in to make sure it wasn't a mockumentary.",1268784000,10,322,5.09433962264151
8295853,5,B001E0KSAM,"I just saw this online at Answers In Genesis' website ([...] and was impressed.

The producers have put together a well thought-out argument that we need to be very careful about implementing radical action to try to combat something (""global warming"") that doesn't look like it is even a problem, much less a man-made problem.

This documentary will be of most interest to Christians, since it does contain a significant amount of material from a biblical perspective.",1240704000,5,469,5.077922077922078
8295854,5,B001E0KSAM,"Just as the title implied ""A scientific review of the data.""
It is an execellent debunking of the view of ""some scientist"" mostly related to the United Nations.",1238889600,7,160,4.75
