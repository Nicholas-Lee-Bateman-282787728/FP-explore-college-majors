The 21st Century classical music may rightly be characterised, in the operatic genre, a the 'B' era; 'B' standing for baroque and bel canto, as opposed to the 'V' era of the last century, represented by Verdi and verismo works.
One of the pioneers of the 'B' movement is of course William Christie, who was a protege of Alfred Deller.  Christie quickly established himself as a leading baroque expert, founding his own ensemble Les Arts Florissants. Since 2002 they decided to expand their work from performance and recording to education, forming Le Jardin des Voix, an academy that takes a cohort of singers through an entire year-long process from audition a final performance in a program ranging from Monteverdi to Haydn at the Thtre de Caen. The documentary is about this journey, in which thirteen singers, all young and well trained vocally, including Juan Sancho, Pascal Charbonneau, Sonya Yoncheva, Francesca Boncompagni, Claire Meghnagi ... are chosen from a large number of hopefuls, and this documentary follows their progress, with a fair portion devoted to the auditions themselves. The documentary featured an Italian woman who is largely self-taught, a Polish countertenor, a dark Handelian bass who conducts his own early-music ensemble in Cambridge, and a Bulgarian soprano with a dark, rich tone. These are the ones chosen, but the film also shows moments of those who fail to be selected. Christie himself displays some disappointment when his auditions in the United States fail to find anyone he considers suitable, and there is considerable relief when the basso is chosen in London, just as they were thinking that there were to be few male voices. Interspersed are the daily lives of the chosen hopefuls.
The final portion shows the year of work at the academy, with each of the students learning stage deportment, ornamentation, interpretation, and phrasingin other words, how to bring the music of the period to life.
This documentary is an important and yet rare look into how early-music singers are nurtured. Although sometimes the continuity seems a bit fractured as scenes of personal lives and the audition process are interwoven, the editing and cinematography are well done.
Of the students chosen, Sonya Yoncheva (Bulgairan soprano) and Juan Sancho (Spanish tenor) have by now established themselves as operatic singers of the top batch.",1425945600,2,2739,5.208616780045351
