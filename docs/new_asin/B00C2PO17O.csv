5688894,5,B00C2PO17O,My daughter has two Pajanimals books that she received in her kids meals at a fast food restaurant so when we put on the Pajama Party DVD she was already familiar with the characters.  She asks that I play the DVD at least twice a day!  She loves to get up and dance and sing along with the adorable characters.  The songs are catchy and the words are easy to sing along with. I love the lessons that each story teaches.,1373068800,,420,4.160493827160494

5688903,5,B00C2PO17O,"We love the pajanimals- and have been eagerly awaiting a new movie from them- so when I saw this one I knew I had to jump on it for my 2 and a half year old daughter. She was as THRILLED as I thought she would be when it finally came! We watch the pajanimals as a special treat before bed-time some nights- and this movie did not disappoint us- it helps make our night time routine happier. My daughter loves to sing the familiar theme song- and was excited for ""new stories"" in this disk.  Her favorite is the second episode where all of the pajanimals play instruments and ""make music"" together. She wanted to watch it over and over! Music is her favorite thing in the world- so this earned big points in her eyes.  I appreciate the soothing songs and the great messages all of these stories provide as well. On a side not- I received a disk that was not playing correctly and that second episode kept freezing up my DVD player- NCircle was VERY quick to send a replacement- no questions asked. I can't say enough great things about this company! Great shows, and awesome customer service. Thank you!",1374796800,3,1102,4.397058823529412
5688904,5,B00C2PO17O,"This month has been crazy, my son just turned 2 so I've been getting things ready for his party and let me tell you the Psjanimals: Pajama Party dvd has been a big help. As a NCirlce NSider I get to review a dvd each month. I was really excited to see that not only did NCircle have a new Pajamimals dvd but that it was a birthday one too. My son loves the Pajamimals, they are a great way to wind down at nap time and the end of the night. They are a big part of our nightly routine.

In this dvd Cowbella, Apollo, Sweet Pea Sue and Squacky visit Birthday Land. There they learn that their birthdays are special not because of the things you get or what you have at your party but because your friends and family come to see you. That sometimes you may feel jealous if it isn't your birthday but that everyone has their own special day. They also learn that it isn't the gift you give but that it comes from the heart. All that and that's just three of the episodes on this super cute dvd. There are still two other episodes that deal with not giving up is something is hard to do, the other a dance party with plenty of fun. The Pajanimals: Pajama Party dvd is full of lessons made simple for young children and has a bunch of cute songs. My son loves watching it and I love the lessons each episode teaches.",1373932800,,1310,4.097276264591439

8576584,4,B00C2PO17O,"At first my 1.5 year old was not really liking the Pajanimals. He had never seen the show before (neither had I), but I got this dvd based on reviews, it's apart of the N Circle network of children's entertainment (I have come to trust their entertainment value for children's entertainment as all of their shows are entertaining yet educational), and I was seeking some more videos that would be nice for my child to watch right before bedtime to help him settle down. The Pajanimals grew on him after a watching this dvd and another one of the Pajanimal dvds a few times. Now he is fond of them and enjoys watching the episodes. Otherwise I was afraid I was going to have to donate the Pajanimals video/s to goodwill.  There's 4 episodes. The dvd is about 1 hour long. I find myself singing the theme song sometimes. It's cute. LoL I like how the episodes teaches children why sleep is important and how to face all the issues kids encounter with bedtime and real life situations with playmates (ie. practice makes perfect, scared of the dark, nightmares, can't sleep, when to wake up, sharing is caring, etc)",1476489600,,1111,4.582914572864322

8576586,5,B00C2PO17O,"Love Pajanimals and so does my son! They are cute, innocent and soothing to watch. Many parents or older children might not like them because they might find them boring but remember that the target market for this product are young children (toddlers) and parents that want children to enjoy their childhood!",1462233600,,309,4.961538461538462
8576587,5,B00C2PO17O,"Good for bedtime, but it gets old quickly when you're watching the same thing over and over, I'd build a collection to choose from.",1459987200,,131,4.5
