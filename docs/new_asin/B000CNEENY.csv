I liked how honest it was; that he wasn't perfect, & owned up to his mistakes (the story of a fight in school ect.) The ending with his father was a great way to reach others for Christ.  Maybe good for older youth group in church.  Also, video techniques kept your interest, too.  A blessing to watch.",1154304000,,478,4.230769230769231
8099814,5,B000CNEENY,"We presented ""A Hero's Love: The Daniel Unger Story"" to 150+ incarcerated teenage boys.  They related immediately to Daniel and were inspired by the life he led.  Daniel Unger is an outstanding role model because his high personal standards are not beyond the reach of most young people.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house.  I wholeheartedly recommend this documentary, especially to the Christian community of America, to prison outreaches, to youth, and to patriotic gatherings.",1149120000,2,482,5.220779220779221
8099815,5,B000CNEENY,"If you consider yourself a patriotic American, you will enjoy this documentary.  The heartfelt story of this young man and his family and friends who loved him is uplifting and encouraging.  I cried as this family shares with the viewers their greatest loss, but found such comfort in the great hope that they so devotedly share with all who will listen.

This film is appropriate for all ages, and can be used to start wonderful discussions concerning: Patriotism, U.S. History and the wars we have been/are involved in.  It exemplifies a Christian worldview, as well as the true meaning of sacrifice.  Teenagers will easily relate to the hero, and parents will admire this young man's family.

Thank you for this ""real-life"" story of sacrifice and love.",1133827200,2,755,4.9523809523809526
