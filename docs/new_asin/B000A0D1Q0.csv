2345156,5,B000A0D1Q0,"This is probably the most entertaining and perhaps the most honest WWE DVD ever released.  I think it was done in good taste, a true representation of the Ultimate Warrior in an hour and a half time frame.  Let's face it, The Ultimate Warrior was a flash in the pan champion with a lot of spunk and that was about it.  Although never a Warrior fan, (always cheered for Rick Rude or anyone else facing Warrior), at age 8 I still understood the impact he had in the WWF.  It is quite sad to think that a human being can ""self destruct"" like this, he must have been on so many steroids.  His ego is probably more impressive than his muscles, and he had less wrestling talent than Barry Horowitz, really.  I think the WWE really should look into a series of wrestlers who were flash in the pans like Bill Goldberg and perhaps Brock Lesner.",1128124800,,835,4.32051282051282
2345157,4,B000A0D1Q0,"WWE's ""The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"" documentary, while not being as good as the ECW or Road Warriors docs, is at least funny and entertaining for most of its hour and a half running time. Highlights include: the segment on Warrior's insane interviews in which Christian, Edge & Y2J give hilarious imitations; comments by Hulk Hogan on Warrior's WCW run & their terrible match at Halloween Havoc 98; and pretty much anything Mean Gene or Bobby Heenan say. This DVD is worth a look especially if you grew up a Warrior fan. Now to the bonus matches.

1. vs. Terry Gibbs (DUD out of *****)

This is Warrior's debut on Wrestling challenge I believe. Total squash and not entertaining in the least. Only here for historical purposes I guess.

2. vs. Honky Tonk Man (DUD)

This is from SummerSlam 88. Warrior wins the I-C title in less than 30 seconds. Significant only because this was Warrior's first title.

3. vs. WWF champ Hulk Hogan (***)

This is the famous match from Wrestlemania VI in SkyDome. Much better than could possibly be expected from these two. Yeah there were probably only 5 wrestling holds total, but its fun to remember how awesome this was when I was 10 and watching this for the first time, not knowing who was gonna win.

4. vs. Rick Rude, Steel Cage match (**)

This is a Warrior title defense from SummerSlam 90. At only about 10 minutes, this was kinda short for a WWF title match. Some decent action here, including Rude jumping from the top of the cage twice, but this just never feels like a main event. Not terrible but not that good either.

5. vs. Randy Savage, Loser must Retire (****)

From WrestleMania VII; This is without a doubt the Warrior's greatest match. Of course Savage carries the action but the Warrior plays his part as well. Another one of those matches that is not so great from the workrate perspective but entertains none-the-less. I still get hyped up when Savage drops the elbow 5 times and the Warrior still kicks out. Ahhhh...Sweet memories! The best match on the DVD.

My DVD came from FYE and came with a bonus disc that contains 3 extra matches.

1. vs. Hercules (*)

This is from MSG in 1988 a few weeks after their match at WrestleMania IV. I guess this match is included because the feud between these two was discussed in the documentary. Match lasts just shy of 15 minutes which is waaaay too long for these two. Not really worth watching more than once.

2. vs. Sgt. Slaughter (1/2*)

This match is from Saturday Night's Main Event not the Royal Rumble. Terrible match which is only notable for the appearance of The Undertaker who was feuding with the Warrior at the time. Warrior wins by DQ when Mustafa, Adnan and Undertaker interfere. Why not just give us the Rumble match instead?

3. vs. WWF champ Randy Savage (**1/2)

From SummerSlam 92. Not nearly as good as their career match but still not bad. Gets interesting half way in when Flair and Perfect come down to ringside. This was the match in which Perfect was supposedly going to be in the corner of either Savage or Warrior. Turns out he was just working them against each other to benefit Flair. Only good match on the bonus disc.",1127952000,,3170,4.572438162544169
2345158,4,B000A0D1Q0,"Apparently, this WWE DVD was supposed to be made with Warrior (unlike Bret Hart, who has somewhat mended the fence), according the official comments from WWE; unfortunately, THIS is the reason why they RIPPED him hard on this instead: when the fans made him the top wrestlers and he just say ""f*** u WWE!"" in return, and then insulted just about everyone else like the minorities, per se, on top of it all.  Need we go on the fact, he was also the reason (directly or indirectly) why Davey Boy Smith is no longer among the living.  While we can say he has what it takes to be a pro wrestler, his mind is ""so out of it"" that the people once loved to see him succeed, is now ripping him badly.  I can't wait to see what details it'll bring.",1127865600,,738,4.219858156028369
2345159,4,B000A0D1Q0,"First things first, I am was and still am a HUGE Ultimate Warrior fan.  I got back into wrestling from 1997-2002 (I still watch it here and there but no longer consider myself a fan any more) and cheered for wrestlers like The Rock before he was big all the way up until he left (probably the single biggest reason why I lost interest in WWE again).  Before that time I was a WWF fan from 1987-1993 and I absolutely loved the Ultimate Warrior.  Bar none, he is my favorite wrestler of all time, as short a moment in time as it was.

I state this to make it known that I was extremely excited when I heard that WWE was releasing an Ultimate Warrior DVD, scouring the Internet for news on a daily basis to learn more about what was being released regarding my favorite wrestler of all time.  I knew that this was not going to be any love-fest by the WWE brain trust, but I didn't care.  Just the ability to see the warrior in the DVD format and have others talk about the individual that made moments of my sometimes crappy childhood filled with joy... it took me back to happy moments that you cannot easily feel again.

After having rushed out to pick up ""The Self Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior"" and watched the 1.5 hour special about his career in the ring, I find that it was a very FAIR assessment of Warrior's wrestling legacy.  Other Ultimate Warrior fans have written online that this DVD badmouths the former Mr. Hellwig and puts him in a light that isn't completely accurate.  In a situation of ""he said she said"" usually the truth lies somewhere in between so I am sure that this DVD isn't 100% accurate, but my overall impression of this disc is that it is very FAIR (and again, I remind you that I was about as a big a fan as there is of The Ultimate Warrior).

Starting off with the origins of the Ultimate Warrior from Rock to Dingo Warrior to Ultimate Warrior, this DVD speaks of UW's quick rise from a house show wrestler to beating the Honky Tonk Man in 30 seconds at SummerSlam 1988 in Madison Square Garden.  Following Warrior's rise in popularity, the UW does the unthinkable on April 1, 1990 in Toronto, Canada at WrestleMania VI as he CLEANLY beats Hulk Hogan in the middle of the ring in what is the penultimate moment of my wrestling fan ""career"".  From this point on we learn how the Warrior defended that very title as best as he could (and I truly believe the Warrior did the best he could do), until he eventually lost it to Sgt. Slaughter and arguably then had the best match of his career with Randy Savage at WrestleMania VII.  The Ultimate Warrior's 1st run with the WWF came to an end in 1991 when (as the WWF and Vince claim - Warrior himself says this isn't true) during the SummerSlam PPV Warrior demanded more money or he wouldn't perform.  After a 7 month hiatus we see The Ultimate Warrior make his incredibly shocking return at the end of WM VIII to begin his 2nd run with the WWF which would only last a mere 8 months or so.  Warrior's last 2 runs at wrestling for major promotions are covered in his 4 month 1996 WWF run and his 3 month 1998 WCW run (he hasn't wrestled in a big promotion since that time).

Throughout the history of UW's wrestling career we get comments from Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, Ted Dibiase, Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Jim Ross, Hulk Hogan, Bruce Pritchard, Jerry Lawler, Christian, Chris Jericho, Ric Flair and many others.  To say that these fellow wrestlers put Warrior in a bad light is like saying that rotten eggs smell bad.  It's quite evident that Jim (most of these guys refuse to call him Warrior unless it's with their eyes in the back of their heads) wasn't very popular in the back room, and never will be.

But as I have said numerous times in this review, IT'S FAIR.

You generally get the impression when someone is lying, and it's pretty evident that everyone on this DVD is speaking from their hearts.  They truly believe what they are telling the camera about the Ultimate Warrior and it is highly entertaining to say the least.

As an individual that prides themselves on knowing as much as possible about The Ultimate Warrior, I learned new things about the man from Parts Unknown, more so than anything else, how little he was respected in the back room by ""the boys"".  As much as wrestling is for the fans, when it comes to the end of the day, the most important thing is how you interact with your little wrestling family in the back room.  The fans you see maybe  20 minutes a night, your fellow wrestlers the entire rest of the day.  It's a shame that as loved as the Warrior was from 1989-1991, he was so disliked by everyone else.

If you read any of Warrior's posts on his web site (ultimatewarrior.com) he'll tell you over and over again how much he can't stand the WWF and that they are liars, but when you have so many people saying 1 thing and 1 other person saying another, you can't help but think that maybe the problem isn't everyone else.  Mr. Hellwig (sorry, WARRIOR) would have you believe that Vince has ""brainwashed"" his entire stable, but after watching this DVD you will probably feel otherwise.

My only complaint is that as good as 1.5 hour feature is, this collection could have been even more.  It's quite clear that no ""double dipping"" will be done for another Ultimate Warrior DVD, so why not have matches on here like Warrior/Slaughter from Royal Rumble 1991, the complete Super Posedown from RR1989 with Rick Rude, more interview segments like when he gets hits by Honky Tonk in summer 1988, Rude at WMV, Hercules at WMIV, the whole Jake feud in 1991 and so forth?  There are a handful of matches on here including the 2 big ones with Hogan at WMVI (sadly Jesse Ventura's commentary had to be cut out) and Savage at WMVII, but this set of choices feels lacking.

Overall, a very entertaining DVD that any Warrior fan should take a look at, and any wrestling fan that wants to learn more about the Ultimate Warrior shouldn't ignore (especially if you are ignorant of the story of Warrior).

2345160,5,B000A0D1Q0,"Warrior sucks, he has always sucked in the ring and how he became a marketable Champ is honestly beyond even the most hardcore fans.

Myself, being a Striaght up 100% Wrestling fan sees enjoyment in the works of lets say: Benoit, Angle, Guerrero, Melenko,Jericho,STyles, Daniels, CM Punk, Samoa Joe and all those guys, while the casual wrestling fans love lower talented yet charismatic guys like, Hulk Hogan. Batista. John Cena. ULTIMATE WARRIOR.goldberg.

See if your a hardcore pure wrestling fan then you hate the Ultimate warrior since his Talent is very limited.

So, If you like flat out wrestlers and absolutly DESPISE the spotlight hogging low talent stars, this burial my be for you.

Although Warrior did have a crazy background and its good that they uncovered some myths. It makes me wonder who is next on Vince's list and is this the next trend for WWE, to pick a wrestler and degrade him? The matches were lackluster and I wish they added an Andre The Giant match instead of the ones we've seen all before. Documentary had its moments, but for the most part, it was just The Warrior was a nut and no one liked him. Funny, but if your a Warrior fan, look away.",1127347200,4,641,4.095238095238095

2345163,1,B000A0D1Q0,"Encase you didn't know, the Ultimate Warrior and Vince McMahon have been on bad terms for a number of years now. The WWE wanted Warrior to participate in this DVD, but they couldn't come to terms.

So typical WWE and Vince McMahon showing no integrity, they decided to bury him in the DVD. This DVD makes a mockery out of him, completely bashes him. Ultimate Warrior reiterates this statement and completely bashes McMahon on his website (most of which is blatantly honest criticism.)

If you're a true Ultimate Warrior fan, DO NOT buy this DVD and put more money in Vince McMahon's pockets. You'll be doing no justice to the good memories you have as a wrestling fan years ago.

Why would Warrior fans want to buy a DVD bashing him? Just another example of WWE profiting off of the stars of the past because their product today is absolutely horrible.",1126310400,10,852,4.629139072847682

Secondly, it was the only access to Warrior's matches.  After watching it again, it reminded me of why it made me feel dirty to even own it.  Because Vince McMahon is an immature, childish, vengeful, malicious person, who used this DVD as a tool to get revenge on Warrior for refusing to participate in the project, amongst other things. He also ordered some of his wrestlers to appear on the DVD and badmouth Warrior, some of which had never even worked with him.  McMahon a year or so later, was on the verge of doing the same exact thing to Bret Hart, until Bret agreed to participate in the DVD.

Then another short lived return,  another hiatus then a very short stint in WCW before he called it a career.  This video goes over some of the reasons why a star as big as the warrior was never a permanent  staple in WWE or WCW.

This was an interesting video and goes over the reason why the warrior kept coming and going and never stuck around very long. While this video was interesting don't kid yourself: This is a grade A hatchet job by the WWE. Since this was created by the WWE this is 100% one sided from the WWE point of view and no one else. The video spends the better half of an hour having current and former WWE employees (Bobby Heenan clearly hated the warrior and never once hides that fact)  say anything and everything about the warrior what an awful person he was to work with.

However, there is plenty of footage of him climbing the ranks towards the title and eventually fading away. I was quite surprised and learned a lot about the real business of wrestling.

However if you're a warrior fan you will hate watching these guys badmouth him. I think its shameful and childish of WWE to put this out only to stick it to him. If he was a jerk and had all these personality traits that were so terrible, FINE, but why ruin the fans memories of him? I still dig the Warrior character and watching this DVD did not ruin the character for me. But it probably did for A LOT of other people. That just seems wrong to me. His days in the spotlight have passed, I see no cause to create a DVD like this and just crap all over his legacy. Cause it really seems thats the only reason they made this DVD. They stuck very few matches on here as well. Again, I think was a childish and petty thing to make. But you still get some good memories out of it in DVD quality. So I give it 3 stars because it can be fun to watch, but can also be very irritating at the same time.

  i understand there is an  entire 90 minute plus dvd with just wrestlers talking crap on the ultimate warrior.what an ungrateful bunch of d#$%^!s.the ultimate warrior was one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.and thats how they repay his awesomeness and many great contributions to the wrestling world?by putting out a degradating video set of him?what a joke! if you do buy this dvd set,just skip the talking dvd.i would.and who goes out and buys a dvd set like this anyway?an ultimate warrior fan who would hear everyone talking trash on his hero?a wrestling historian who just likes the old stories?someone who hates the warrior and wants to talk bad?
  then theres old triple h! on every dvd set,he talks bad on whoever its made for.he made fun of the big shows weight problem and his diabetes.he said hardcore wasn't a style although he was defined by hardcore matches.he said rey mysterio jr wasn't any good even though rey beat him twice already in high profile matches.he even trashed vince mc mahon.if it wasn't for vince,triple h wouldnt even have a job,a wife ,a child or something like 13 world title reigns.triple h is an ungrateful p@#$$%!
  and you know what triple h said?he said his loss to the ultimate warrior at wrestlemania was one of the most embarrassing moments in wwe history.the audacity! the ultimate warrior slapped triple h around and called him suzie! he kicked that pompous,losers butt in 1:38.i would be embarrassed  too.
  the wrestlers frequently say they cant understand the ultimate warrior's interviews. maybe they've taken too many chairs to the  head. they weren't that different than hulk Hogan's interviews. maybe they should read a book and then they'll have the brain power to keep up.
  so,one dvd will be garbage and one will be a classic.plus,i looked up the ultimate warrior online.in the video,vince says he lokked for any reason at all to fire the ultimate warrior,because he was unprofessional.all of the things i found usualy stemmed from vince stiffing him on money he owed.and the one good excuse i did find was the ultimate warrior using drugs.vince tries to sound like he cares.every biography ive ever watched on wrestling says marijauna,steroids and pain killers were everywhere in wrestling.and many times supplied by vince himself.it just gets my blood boiling to see one of the greatest wrestlers of all time get talked down on by hypocrites.

An analogy:  A stage actor might say ""so-and-so is a terrible actor"" and mean that he is never ready for a scene, never knows his lines or his cues, and needs tons of work to get the finished product done.

YOU the viewer of said film might never know it...because the rest of the cast suffers through endless takes to get it right.

THAT is what they mean -- that ""so-and-so is a poor wrestler"" -- he HURTS people (or doesn't care enough to polish his skills to avoid HURTINGZ others).  He flubs the script.  The others have to work very, very hard to put him over with the crowd.

2345303,5,B000A0D1Q0,"I do not know if I've ever seen so many jealous wrestlers on one video before. Every single person interviewed on this disc has many things in common. One of which being that none of them really knew James Hellwig very well, and their entire argument is based on a great deal of assumptions about the man. Additionally, these guys have toiled in the industry for far longer than Jim and have never reached his level of fame or admiration. Jealous much? Mr. Hellwig accomplished in a few years what the biggest wrestlers of yesteryear, and today will never accomplish, that being, legendary status. They actually hold the Warrior's intense, reckless, and fast style against him, which is flat ignorant on their part. How could they not know that was the greatest part of his appeal? I thought it was funny how no one understood what Warrior was saying, when I perfectly understood him.""Family that I live for, only breathe the air that smells of combat! With or without the facepaint, I am the Ultimate Warrior!"" Is just one example I'm proud to say I understand. Jim is a very intelligent person, so I'm not surprised that he was speaking on a level that the other wrestlers could not comprehend. The other guy's not having much brains at all, Bobby the brain Heenan included. Maybe they are not aware of metaphors? Berating the Warrior for his lack of experience, when he's really just learning the ropes like everyone else. That stuff takes time, you can't rush experience. A man who is tall, good looking, in perfect physical shape, and exceptionally intelligent, is always easy to hate. This video is a testimony of that fact. When Vince Mcmahon attacks Warrior for being absent after Warrior's father died shows how utterly heartless the man is, and also stupid. Imagine how many more people have had this same treatment working for Vince. The guy practically drove every great wrestler to other organizations in the nineties, and still does too. Vince is no saint, despite the picture this video tries to paint, I am so glad the Warrior stuck it to him as much as he did.

UW's side would probably be the same. The whole truth will never be told.

Hogan was very complimentary throughout the dvd. UW opened the door for short term wrestlers. Examples: Bill Goldberg and Brock Lesnar. (Though they are not mentioned)
Warrior also believes he is bigger than Hogan. Whatever!
Hogan is the greatest attraction ever. Not the greatest wrestler but this is entertainment.

Warrior will be remembered by me as intense and good attraction as one of my favorites.

 One more thing WWE just tried to put UW in the 2010 Hall of Fame. Hypocrisy on the part of WWE when they utterly trashed and tried to bury him.

personally, i enjoyed watching the ultimate warrior as much as watching hulk hogan. This dvd is an attempt to take away almost all the credit that warrior deserves. He brought a lot to the WWF back in the days. The WWF had a lot of the same boring matches. The ultimate warrior was unique! His style of entertaining was different from all the other wrestlers. In this dvd, many other wrestlers talk about how he didn't make sense in his interviews (early in his career). That was definitely a rookie mistake! But.. he learned and eventually started to make more sense. There are other wrestlers talking about how he didn't really know how to wrestle and didn't care about the history of the wwf. Seriously?!?! He was a good entertainer. Fans wanted to see him do his crazy entrance and wrestle his crazy style! His look, his energy and his entrance music was what made him so popular. So what if he couldn't really wrestle?! He knew how to entertain the fans and get them off their seats everytime. Other wrestlers are just hating him because he got to their level of popularity (or higher) in a lot less time. They could've said the same thing about The Undertaker. He blew up because he knew how to entertain!
This video is also a one sided story. It's just everybody else talking smack about him. The warrior didn't get to respond to anything anybody said. It is just the WWE and other wrestlers destroying his legacy. Truth be told, he contributed a lot to the WWF. You can ask anybody (who watched wrestling in those days), who were their top 10 fav. wrestlers of all time. The ultimate warrior would be on everybodies list!

Hulk hogan
the ultimate warrior

Randy savage

2345320,3,B000A0D1Q0,"I probably should have realized that the WARRIAH~! parted on poor terms with the WWF in 1996, but I hadn't realized just how poor they were.

This documentary is rather entertaining, with lots of footage of the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! but for the most part... it's not a ""documentary""; it's commentary.

While people like Edge, Jericho, and Christian seem to respect the WARRIAH~!, everyone else just absolutely s***s on the man every moment they can after the opening pleasantries about how big an impact he made on the business!

Every other scene features Hulk Hogan or Ted DiBiase or Bobby Heenan or Sergeant Slaughter or Steve Lombardi or Bruce Prichard or Gene Oakerlund s***ing on the WARRIAH~!  Every chance they can, they keep saying how awful a wrestler WARRIAH~! was, which in the case of some people (Hulk Hogan much?) is the equivalent of the Pot approaching the Kettle and saying ""You are black"".

Obviously WARRIAH~! was nowhere near a decent wrestler at the time, but the fact that his peers constantly remark just how awful he is is insulting and a blatant ""hitjob"" to tarnish his skills.  The fact is, while his skills weren't likely very good, they were about on par with much of the WWF's in-ring quality of the time.  Is the WARRIAH~! a bad wrestler?  Yes.  Is he substantially worse than Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Rick Rude, Sergeant Slaughter?  Absolutely not.  The WWF's in-ring style in the mid-late 80s and early 90s was what is called by some ""hoss"" style, meaning a heavy emphasis on ""big"" guys (muscly or tall) and little to no emphasis on actual athletic talent.  This was in the era where Vince's Big and Tall fetish was running rampant.

Even after showing the part regarding WARRIAH~!'s Wrestlemania victory over Hogan, they CONTINUE to s*** all over WARRIAH~!'s skill, and go on to start PRAISING HOGAN as if he were the superstar for so graciously ""passing the torch"" to Hogan, while Jericho, Edge, and Christian have the decency to say that WARRIAH~! could put on great matches with great opponents.

Before this DVD, I had figured the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! had had some sort of colossal mental breakdown or devolving into serious drug use or something to warrant such a title as ""The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"".  Instead, it starts ALL OF A SUDDEN in early 1991, after continuous WARRIAH~! bashing and a quick overview of his feuds with Rick Rude and Randy Savage.

ALL OF A SUDDEN at the Royal Rumble, it's said that WARRIAH~! basically held up Vince for more money, saying he wouldn't go out and perform unless he got paid a certain amount.  I agree that this is a really piss-poor unprofessional thing to do, but the talking-head commentary takes this event and runs with it for the next ten minutes, bashing and bashing how awful and evil a man WARRIAH~! is and how arrogant he is and how bad a wrestler he is (take a shot) and how ungrateful he is.

Then comes his lawsuit in 1993, changing his name to Warrior, and returning to the WWF in 1996, only to be fired again for no-showing and demanding more money.  Again, this is a bad thing, but hardly anything like ""self destruction"".

Perhaps his brief time in WCW could explain the whole ""self destruction"" part, and it does... for five minutes.  And only covering one promo.  ONE!  WARRIAH~!'s first coming to WCW, where he had a 15 minute rambling promo on Hulk Hogan that, due to WCW's own incompetence and lack of leadershipm was completely unscripted, nonsensical, redundant, and absolutely mad and out of control.

And that's it.  Then they go on to show his match against Hogan from Halloween Havoc 98, arguably one of the worst in history.

Then it ends with some brief mention of his speaking tours, which unfortunately they can't show any footage of (I would've given this DVD five stars if they just had the footage or at least mention of that damn chestnut of WARRIAH~! wisdom ""Queering doesn't make the world work""*), and that's it.

So what we have is a fun collection of videos of WARRIAH~!, accompanied by a total hitjob of bashing and heavily biased commentary, boiling down to Christian, Edge, and Jericho respecting WARRIAH~! for his contributions to the business, and the rest hating WARRIAH~! and hoping he burns in hell (exaggeration, but close enough).

Also, bonus matches~!  But why would you want to watch a WARRIAH~! match?

*I completely disagree with this statement and believe it is wrong and in poor taste.  However, I happen to find it a hilarious statement due to the sheer ridiculousness and tastelessness of it.",1217894400,,4549,4.771392081736909
2345321,4,B000A0D1Q0,"First of the documentary:

The documentary is very obvious to anyone watching that it is a smear campaign.  They wanted Jim ""The Warrior"" Helwig to be a part of the disc but when he said ""No way"" they went on a mission to bury him.  The result is entertaining as hell but VEERRRRY laughable.  There is probably about as much truth to this doc as their is B.S.  Some of it is grounded and lots more is pretty unfair.

It's easy to crap all over the Warrior when there are all of these crazy videos of him online ranting like a madman.  But the truth is that WWE tried to screw him out of money that he was agreed to...on more than one occasion.

The doc mocks his ring entrance, his in-ring work, and his crazy interviews and so forth-- but these are all the same reason that they hired him in the first place!  They were WELL versed in what the Warrior could do.  And they knew they had picked up a great talent because when they gave him a big push he made them (and himself) a lot of money.

The Warrior had very minimal technical skills in the ring but his physicality and charisma, both of which were stellar, put him over w/ the fans in a big way.  The smear campaign comes of as a bit tongue-in-cheek, particularly with the wreslter interviews because it's clear that they all idolized him as teens.  I'd give the doc a 4 out of 5 stars simply on entertainment value alone.  Just don't believe everything Vince would like you to.

The Matches: There are 3great matches out of the few that are on this.  And if you're lucky enough to on the 2-Disc special edition (available only at FYE stores) then there are FOUR great matches.

These are those matches==
Steel Cage match for the WWE(WWF) Title
vs. Rick Rude
Summerslam '90

**** (out of 5)
Roddy Piper's utter disdain for the Warrior during his commentary was HILARIOUS!  There was such a real hatred for the guy that he couldn't hide it even though the Warrior was the biggest face draw that year.  The match itself was a very fast-paced brawl for that era ('85sh-'92ish).  Very entertaining if not a bit short.

WWE (WWF) Title
vs. Hulk Hogan(c)

****
It's rumored heavily that these two actually REHEARSED this match (a practice that really hadn't been done since the '70s) in order to make it look good.  This is the first time on t.v. that Hogan missed his leg drop.  This match the best performance any one had seen from either of these guys from a in-ring work perspective up until that point.

Career Match
vs. Macho King Randy Savage w/ Queen Sherri
Wrestlemania VII

*** 1/2
Savage took Warrior to new heights in this match and as a result both came off really well.  The end dragged on a bit and so did the post-match between Savage/Elizabeth but for the time that was considered high drama in the world of pro wrestling *ahem* sports entertainment.

Bonus disc highlight:

**** 1/2

WWE (WWF) Title
vs. Randy Savage (c)
The build-up/storyline for this match was probably the best in WWE history up to this point.  And the match didn't disappoint.  These two worked so well together and Savage (one of the most gifted wrestlers of all time) elevated Warrior to a match that we will never see again from these guys unfortunately.  There are so many near falls and every single one is a nail-biter.  The storyline (""Which guy is hired Ric Flair & Mr. Perfect to help them win?"") builds the tension even more.  This is an oft overlooked classic.

There are handful of other matches on this DVD but these were really the only ones of note.  I just wish they had included his WCW debut @ Fall Brawl in the late '90s (and I'm glad they avoided putting the Halloween Havoc match).

2345324,2,B000A0D1Q0,"As much of a big fan as I was of the Ultimate Warrior I had to give this DVD set a 2. First of all where is the Warrior's side of the story of what really happened in his career. All I heard was some of the guys that worked with him and even guys who were still in kindergarten flapping their gums. For the most part they were dissing on the Warrior left and right which makes him an easy target for the WWE to attack. As for the name of this DVD set is an insult. Why would the WWE use the title Self Destruction. After all the WWE is notorious for many former wrestlers no longer walking the face of the Earth. Wrestlers that don't get to live past retirement only because they didn't take care of themselves. That is what the term Self Destruction means to me.

The WWE even talks about the warrior getting fired on 3 different occasions, such as Summer Slam of 1991 when Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior team up against Sgt. Slaughter, General Adnan and Col. Mustafa. The WWE's story was that the Warrior demanded more money or he wasn't going to show up for that match which was true but Vince McMahon says that it was like pointing a gun to his head. The real story was that the Warrior was owed money from Wrestle Mania 7 and that was the money he demanded. The second time was the following year just before the Survivor Series 1992 when he was tag team partners with 'Macho Man' Randy Savage. The WWE says that the Warrior failed a drug test, ""a failed drug test?"" Not to long ago they suspended 10 of their wrestlers for steroid use for about a week all separately and none of them got fired. Well anyway the real reason the Warrior got fired was a breach of contract. The WWE wanted to basically change his character from the one that we are used to seeing perform. The final time was when the Warrior's father passed away which was true but the WWE made it sound like ""the Warrior didn't care"" and was only using it as an excuse so the Warrior wouldn't show up to his matches.

I thought this set could have had more matches like including more matches with Rick Rude such as the match that they had at Wrestle Mania 5 for the I.C. Title or even the rematch at SummerSlam 1989 for the I.C. Title. I believe that the Ultimate Warrior had the best chemistry with Rick Rude because alot of the moves that the Warrior used after this rivalry, were used by Rick Rude when they wrestled against eachother. They also could have added the match he had with Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble in 1991, which was more intense than the rematch that they had about 3 months later. This match that they included ended in a disqualification due to outside interference by the Undertaker. How about the match he had with triple H at Wrestle Mania 12, which was highly anticipated because of his return to the WWE after a 3 1/2 year absence. Even the match that he had with Jerry the King Lawler at the King of the Ring of 1996 which was his final pay per view match with the WWE. I thought that this should have been a 3 disc set instead of 2. They didn't even include any of the promos that he did leading up to his matches even though nobody understood what he was saying they could have been added to a third disc.

In my mind the Ultimate Warrior had a great career that was obviously taken away from him because the wrestling business wanted to control him. He put alot of money in the pockets of the guys that talked trash about him, he put @sses in seats to give the fans that little something extra and this is what he got in return. I thought his career should have been presented in an unbiased manner. They could have at least have kept it 50/50 such as looking at his career both ways. Not even Triple H and Shawn Michaels can keep his name out of their mouths. Even to this day if the Ultimate Warrior were to come back to the WWE, he will be well recieved by the fans. If that were to happen I'm pretty sure that there would be alot of tension in the back and have other wrestlers thinking that this guy is in my territory and he is invading it. The Warrior should one day be in the Hall of Fame for all of his accomplishments. Unfortunetely that day may not happen because of the personal vendetta with those evil McMahons and he probably wouldn't show up anyway if he was asked to participate.",1201046400,7,4309,4.246041412911084
2345345,2,B000A0D1Q0,"I bought this DVD release some years ago because I was a Warrior fan in the 1980's.  This disc is not worth its price and the fact that it is only a 1 disc release shows what a shabby release it is from McMahon's usually great video department.  The extras and matches on the DVD are few and add little value to the release.  The matches are generally already available on other McMahon video releases.

The main feature is about 90 minutes and is a collection on half truths and blatant lies.  There is nothing in the main feature of this disc that you do not already know about the Warrior and that is not already written about for free on the internet.  Warrior refused to participate in the making of this disc (he is currently in litigation over the disc against McMahon), so Vince McMahon decided to turn the disc into a slanderous hatchet job on the Warrior with Vince and his corporate toadies (Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler, Bruce Pritchard, et cetera) defaming the Warrior.  Vince McMahon wanted to use this Warrior disc as a test to see if he could get away with lying about the careers and lives of wrestlers without getting sued, so Vince could put out similar releases on other former wrestlers he hates (Randy Savage, Brock Lesnar, Lex Luger, et cetera) and threaten Bret Hart to cooperate in the production of his DVD box set (the Bret box set was to be called ""Screwed: The Bret Hart Story"" if Hart had not cooperated in its making as Warrior refused to cooperate here).

Yes, Jim Hellwig (Warrior) is a real life nut case and was not the greatest wrestler in the history of professional wrestling.  No, Warrior was not just some ungrateful body builder who Vince McMahon found and turned into a superstar despite the lies to that effect that Vince and his flunkies spew in this DVD release (Warrior was a huge star in Texas before he decided to move to the big time of the WWF).  No, Warrior did not leave Mid South Wrestling because it was too physically intense for him as Bill Watts / Vince McMahon boot licker Jim Ross lyingly says (Warrior left because Watts was cheating him on money and trying to take phyical liberties with him).  Hearing Hogan and Bischoff lie and spin about Warrior's time in WCW (sure Warrior was not just brought in so Hogan could get his win back - wink, wink) was unintentional comedy gold (of course Renegade was not just a Warrior rip off designed to try to get Warior to come to WCW - wink, wink).

McMahon is bitter at Warrior for Warrior beating McMahon in court multiple times.  McMahon has broken verbal and written contracts with the Warrior on several occassions.  Warrior now completely owns his own gimmick and has no need for Mcmahon, which drives McMahon crazy.  If Warrior was such a flash in the pan and so worthless as this disc claims he was, then why did McMahon keep bringing Warrior back over and over again and why did McMahon bother making this DVD?",1200009600,3,2913,4.521904761904762
2345346,4,B000A0D1Q0,This is a great movie and it was AWESOME to see warrior back in action :)  I grew up watching him and loved his character ever since I first saw him like 20 years ago.  Although this movie is more of a hit piece on him by the WWE - it's still really fun to watch :),1183593600,5,265,3.6315789473684212
2345347,5,B000A0D1Q0,"First and foremost, I just wanted to say that I thought this was an excellent DVD and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  If you are a fan of classic wrestling, I would highly recommend it.  If you are/ were a fan of the Ultimate Warrior, this DVD is an absolute must.

The DVD is about the Ultimate Warrior's rise and fall from fame, but it also showcases many of the wrestlers of the time, including some really funny interviews.  It is very well done and brought back many memories for me of when I was young and a huge wrestling fan.  I loved it.

OK, this is a one sided documentary and it is clear that the Ultimate Warrior and the WWE did not have a great working relationship.  However, I believe that everyone interviewed gave a good account of what transpired.  I really don't think that anyone on this DVD was mean spirited or took low blows at the Ultimate Warrior with maybe a couple of exceptions being Bobby Heenen and Rick Flair.  Even Vince McMahon came across as light hearted about what transpired and did not seem to hold much ill will towards the Ultimate Warrior.  And there were some moments where some of those interviewed admitted to liking him and enjoying working with him (Hulk Hogan comes to mind).  Basically, everyone thought he was just crazy.

Admittedly, some parts seemed a bit unfair to the Ultimate Warrior.  I mean, they go on and on making fun of his interviews.  Yes he was clearly ""out there"", but how many wrestlers say anything of importance in their interviews.  It is usually a bunch of nonsense and lunacy.  That's what it's all about.  Then they say that the Ultimate Warrior was a ""flash in the pan"" despite him being in the WWF for over 7 years and being involved in wrestling for well over a decade.  They make it seem that the Ultimate Warrior was a short timer and talk about how he could have had a long run if he had been more professional, etc.  Let's face it, most wrestlers burn out and can only remain popular for so long.  MOST of the guys from the 80's are nowhere to be found with very few exceptions.  As for his wrestling skills, they make it seem like he was horrible, but in the next segment admit how great some of his matches were.

But again, I give the WWE credit for coming out with this DVD and they definitely pay respect to the Ultimate Warrior and what he brought to the table.  Even Vince McMahon, who states he was royally scr@wed by him, admits that the Ultimate Warrior made a huge mark on wrestling.

Get this DVD, sit back with a cold beer and enjoy some classic wrestling memories...",1183248000,2,2570,4.407643312101911
2345348,4,B000A0D1Q0,"WWE's nostalgia DVD's are generally pretty good, but this is one that's been done without the participation of it's star.  It's interesting that WWE devotes a whole DVD to a guy that generates such contempt, who according to luminaries like Jim Ross, Ted Dibiase and Bobby Heenan had very little to offer. So what we get is an entertaining undoubted hatchet job on an unpopular (at least backstage) performer who was an absolute superstar of his era-regardless of what various WWE peons say.

You get the strong impression that a lot of the interviewee's (Flair, DiBiase) didn't actually know Warrior personally at all.

This makes a fine companion piece to the Ringside's Warrior Shoot DVD that came out in 2005. On it Warrior is belligerent and almost adversarial, clearly he would be a prickly guy to deal with.

BUT the simple facts are that Warriors recollection of some events seem a damn site more credible than the WWE's. For instance Jim Ross saying that Bill Watts territory was 'too physical' for Warrior is baloney, Warrior's recollection seems far more on the money. And as for the rubbish that Warrior was a dud wrestler-also complete garbage. Sure he was no Rey Mysterio, but so what?

But Warrior doesn't play by the rules-and there in the problem lies.

2345349,4,B000A0D1Q0,"ORIGINAL June 13, 2007: This Is A Great Collection, Simply Because The Ultimate Warrior Is Such A Great Superstar.  People Could Care Less Abount How Vince McMahan And Even Less About What Million Dollar Man And Bobby The Brain Heenan Think.  I Think They All Know Ultimate Warrior Was A Bigger Influence On WWE Than All 3 Of Them Combined But Just Said All Those Negative Things Just To Make The DVD A Little Bit More Interesting And ""Controversial"" Except For Bobby The Brain Heenan Who You Can Tell REALLY Dispises The Man.  I Think Bobby Heenan Was Just Trying To Gain Some Attention From The People Watching The DVD Even If He Stunk Up The Joint During His Segments In The DVD.

2345350,1,B000A0D1Q0,"On an internet wrestling radio show, someone summed this one up perfectly, ""If you were a fan of Warrior, why would you buy it?, and if you hated Warrior, why would you buy it?""  Seriously why would you pay money to see something about a guy you either love and don't want to see badmouthed, or a guy you hate and don't wanna waste either the time or money on.  Curiosity is the only thing I can think of, I was curious too and felt cheated.  NOBODY in the world needs to have a DVD released about what a loser he supposedly is OR claim that he's a coward when he doesn't want to appear on your programming AFTER the video is out to defend himself.

There is also NOTHING on this disc that even says that Warrior was asked to participate with the project.  That seriously undermines the intentions of this video since the opposing side isn't there to back up the claims.  Hell even Bischoff shows up on the Rise and Fall ECW DVD to defend his company stealing ECW's talent.

The video convinently glosses over some things like his departure in 92, McMahon says there was a ""drug test and a violation"" YEAH, McMahon coming under the gun for distributing steroids to workers and when Warrior wanted to do something else, McMahon fired him and Davey Boy Smith and pointed the finger at them.  The Summerslam 91 match where Vince ""as I recall"" read LIE says he demanded more money or he wouldn't show.  Big rumors go around saying Warrior wanted money for shows he's already done and McMahon hadn't paid up yet.  Triple H says he's the most unprofessional guy ever to work with, yeah well Triple H in 96 was on the outs with WWE and Vince wanted Warrior to squash him.

Too many people in the disc (many of whom were kids when Warrior was around so what the hell are they doing on here?) harp about Warrior being too intense and having little skills.  In a business thats known for intense guys, whoes the most intense there was, WARRIOR.  When WWE pushes guys to the moon that usually don't have the GREATEST technical skills and usually rely on brawling and power attacks, who had this repitoire?  WARRIOR.  Who is one of the few guys who Hogan EVER put over clean.  WARRIOR.  Yeah this guy sucks alright.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not the biggest fan of this guy but c'mon WWE your fooling nobody.

You know WHY WWE can get away with this, it's cause Warriors an easy target.  WWE couldn't get along with him, the troublemakers at WCW used him, TNA Impact gave him a hard time and that with his recent speaking tours where he lets loose with some inflamitory things, makes him okay to target.  Try doing this with an equally big name in the business like Hogan, make a DVD about all his backstage politicking and frail ego or how guys like Benoit and Kidman never got a break with him around.  You'll never see it happen.

Purely a curiosity and nothing more, it WAS fun to see old WWE footage but thats about it.  Don't waste your time.  Get a TNA Impact PPV or ECW dvds or hell get some shoot DVDs from a website or tape trader, but leave this one alone.",1171411200,15,3054,4.3628318584070795
2345351,4,B000A0D1Q0,"I watched this dvd last night and thought I would give it an honest review. First off, I am a bigger fan of Warrior now than I was back them during his wrestling years. Just check out his website and you will see the no bs mind and writtings of the man who has come out on top and really did rise above all the negative things said on the dvd. Was I the only one who noticed on the end credits that the Ultimate Warrior is a trademark of ultimate creations,Inc.? That should tell you something right there that unlike most WWE wrestlers, he is one of the few that owns his name. Smart move by the Warrior.

The first part of the dvd actually says some positive things about the Warrior. His energy level,attitude and of course his physique was what made him such a draw to the fans. He charged the ring and got fans into the match from the very beginning. They say he could not do much in the way of wrestling and his skills were limited. All I know is he did his job for the WWF. He got fans fired up and the whole time he was in the ring he stayed charged up. Not boring at all like so many ""skilled"" wrestlers who make you just want the match to end because there is NO excitement, NO energy, NOTHING there!

You will hear bad comments from Bobby The brain, Ted Debiase,Ric Flair and many others. I think it is a case of jealousy. Wait until you see the shape of these ""icons"" now.  They look terrible, certainly not someone I would respect an opinion from. Now look at Warrior today,still working out,great shape and could blow all these guys away with his mind and body at the same time. I am sure if they each had their own ""self destruction of..."" dvd out they would find out that THEY are really hated to. The way this dvd is presented, even the music in the background you will notice is all a way for you to look at Warrior in a negative way.

And as far as his going to WCW for a short period of time...did you notice he was even more cut up and in better shape than when he was in the WWF? He actually got better as the years went by while the Hogans,Flairs,etc look worse and worse. Just being honest. Ric Flair was one of my favorites at one time and so was Ted Debiase. If anything this dvd showed the self destruction of these guys and I lost all respect for them all at the same time after watching this. All you hear about is about how Warrior was in this for the money. Well, what wrestler isn't in it for the money?

Warrior paid his dues and he was worth more than mnay,if not all of the other wrestlers at the time. This is marketing at it's best. I guess Hogan would go back to wrestling for $25.00 a night because he ""loved"" wrestling and only cares for the fans and not the money. I don't think so. As I said Warrior was smart and they don't like the fact that he could stand for himself and realize his worth. They are all in it for the money truth be told. There is nothing wrong with being successful and making more as you advance. He was at the top and the others who where there for years could not stand this.

I was going to say don't buy this dvd because of all the negative Warrioe bashing. But really I encourage everyone to buy it and you will hopefully see the ""truth."" If you don't want to lose respect for Flair,Hogan,etc. then don't buy it because if you saw this dvd the way I did then you will lose lots of respect for them. Funny thing is you will probably see Warrior in a better person...moving on, speaking,working out,and being a success AND owning his own name(a fact that WWF cannot stand).

This is my opinion and the way I saw it. I just saw so many other reviews and I wanted to show everyone there is another side to the story. Oh yeah, one more thing. As much as Vince/WWF gets mad at not having the rights to all the names in the company guess who else own their own name? Hulk Hogan is a trademark owned by Terry Bollea and is used with permission on this dvd....Talk about a hypocrite...Hogan does the same thing the WWF gets mad at Warrior for!",1170979200,5,4003,4.1441441441441444

Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This ""docu"" is more slanted than ""Fahrenheitt 911"" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it.

2345366,3,B000A0D1Q0,"Let me say that I'm not the biggest Ultimate Warrior fan, I started watching the World Wrestling Federation in 1993, so I missed out on him. I watched as many old tapes that I could get a hold of, and he was ok to me.

The documentary portion of the DVD is a petty attempt by WW""e"" to bury the Warrior, most likely because Warrior always one upped the WWE, he sued them and won his naming rights. When Warrior was fired in 1992 as a scapegoat for the Sex and Steroids Scandal that Vince  was under, WW""e"" played by Warriors terms, Vince practically harassed the man to return, Warrior didn't cave in to their demands. However, in regards to his 2nd return and 3rd return to the company in 1996, the documentary portion would like you to believe otherwise.

Bobby Heenan makes on comment in the DVD that Ultimate Warrior dropped him on his face at WrestleMania V I believe it was, but that's not even the case when they show it, not at all. Bobby Heenan takes many shots at Warrior, he doesn't say one good thing about him.

For supposedly being a born again Christian, Ted DiBiase sure doesn't show it. Same deal with him as with Heenan.

Sgt. Slaughter talks about Warriors wresting ability, lol... Slaughter was [...] in the ring, he was a nobody, right place at the right time during the Gulf War. I don't know who he thinks he is to comment.

Vince is really full of [...] too in regards to ""Warrior holding out for more money"" and they're very sketchy on Warrior's firing in 1992. They phoniness is all very transparent.

Hogan is probably the biggest goof of them all. He makes a comment, in no uncertain terms, says that he set the dinner table  , he drew the fans that Warrior eventually took from him. What an ego. He also makes a comment about WrestleMania VI, saying... ""I told you so"". He comes off as a mark and an ego maniac, as usual.  Also, Hogan commenting on the issue regarding Warrior holding out at Summerslam... lol... talk about a hypocrite.

I don't know the story there, the one WW""e"" tells on the WW""e"" is certainly not accurate, but good for Warrior for getting more money if that's the case. Since when does Vince treat his workers well?

I like the portions on Parts Unknown and the Warrior's interview. They poked fun at it a bit, but it's basically true. I love Warriors interviews though.

On to the matches...

Warrior vs. Terry Gibbs - This is Warriors Debut match.
Match rating: * (only because it's Warriors debut, it's not much of a match)

Warrior vs. Honky Tonk Man - The crowd is electric for this. Again, it's not much of a match, it last a minute if that, but the crowd is insane, and for that and the fact that he ended Honky Tonk Man's 15 month IC title reign...
Match ratings - 3/4.
1/4 for the entrance, 2/4 for the crowd, 3/4ths for the finish.

Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan - A pretty solid match. The match isn't close to great, but the buildup to this match, not knowing who would win, the atmosphere of the Skydome and the fact taht it's WrestleMania... It's one of the most memorable matches of all time.
Match Rating - ***1/4

Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude - A solid match. Rick's top tope moves are impressive for the time. I enjoyed this one.
- ***

Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage - This has to be Ultimate Warriors best match. Great storytelling, the crowd is electric for this one. They didn't show the ending with Savage and Elizabeth reuniting though, which was a big part of the story.
Match Rating - ****

The extras:

Jerry Lawler tells some really lame story. Lawler is one to talk about someone being stiff and uncautious in the ring. Lame.

Ted DiBiase tells a story about Warrior not wating to be seen with Ted at an autograph siginng. Why doesn't Ted tell some stories about him having gang bangs? lol. I can't blame Warrior for not wanting to associate with those hypocrites.

Warrior University is pretty lame.

Christian's does a promo of Warriors From WrestleMania 6

Overall, I enjoyed most of the matches, and that's a reason for buying this. It's just a petty DVD though on the part of Vince McMahon. He talks in DVD about giving the fans what they want, well... it's obviously all about how Vince can make money, that's why he brought Warrior back 2-3 times. If it was really about giving the fans what they want, Vince and the rest of his ass kissers should have kept their insults and propaganda off of this DVD.",1145232000,9,4396,4.453865336658354
2345367,4,B000A0D1Q0,"I have mixed feelings about the content of this DVD. Growing up as a young teenager in the early 90's, the Warrior was my favourite wrestler. The music, the frenetic and almost spastic ring entrance, the Incredible Hulk-a-like style inside the ring...  Coming some years after his fall from grace and seeing he had a web-site ([...]) I eagerly logged on to see what he was doing these days. The impression I got was that the man was a complete lunatic who had been possessed by his character like Linda Blair was possessed by the Devil in The Exorcist. His posts on his web-site are like an ever so slightly toned down version of his gibberings on promo slots during his wrestling days. One gets the impression that the man got bored of real life so made himself believe he was his character and wrapped himself up in a fairy story where he was the central (and only) starring figure. He could certainly have had a better claim to the ""Narcissist"" gimmick Lex Luger ran during the early part of 1993.

This is the impression we get from his contemporaries who are interviewed on the DVD too. Jim Ross, Ted Dibiase, Bobby Heenan, Vince McMahon, Jerry Lawler... All line up to castigate the Warrior and tell stories of how stiff his performances were, how little technical skill he had, what a self-centred egomaniac he was, and how selfish and ignorant he could be. I would have been horrified and outraged at this character assassination and instantly suspected another McMahon speciality screw job (a' la Bret Hart) if it wasn't for the fact that this was the exact same impression I'd gotten from the man's own disjointed,  ramblings on his web-site. I don't doubt for a second that most, if not all, of these highly entertaining anecdotes are true. Having said that, I am left with no doubt that Vince McMahon is also an unprincipled liar and an opportunistic screw-job artist. The way he talks about the faults of others breaks the known bounds of hypocrisy, considering he is capable of being the most dishonest, conniving and unprofessional man in the industry. Him criticising the Warrior's ethos is like a skunk complaining that a dog stinks. McMahon has a brilliant brain for wrestling and its various angles, but as a human being he is worth nothing. Doesn't detract from the fact that he's probably telling the truth about the Warrior here however.

Having said this, the Warrior is still my favourite wrestler of all time and this DVD not only gives you the career commentary, but five of his most memorable matches as an extra: his WWF debut against a ""jobber""; his under 60 second IC title win against the Honky Tonk Man at Summerslam 88; his WWF title win against Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania 6; the WWF title defence against Rick Rude at Summerslam 90, and the thunderous career ending match against Randy Savage at Wrestlemania 7. (The last one being my all time favourite Warrior match and not containing the cuts and rewinds the WM 7 VHS video had.) The wrestling content of this DVD is great, especially for us nostalgia  lovers and especially for actual fans of the Warrior. Say what you like about the man (and I obviously have done) but the wrestler was great fun and captivating to watch. The interview content is also captivating and fun. The newer and younger guys (Christian and Chris Jericho - to name two off the top of my head) are all enthusiastic about the Warrior and recall his days with great enthusiasm (they never had to work with him mind you). Seeing Christian's impression of a classic Warrior promo is side-splitting.

If you're a fan of wrestling back in the early 90's, then go ahead and get this, you won't regret it. If you were a fan of the Warrior himself, then this DVD is probably worth sacrificing one of your internal organs for.",1142899200,2,3778,4.673684210526316

I've read a article by the Ultimate Warrior( and yes that is his legal name now) that he would never bow down and help make money for Vince.

Boy was I wrong. Before I purchased this DVD, I had an idea of what it was going to be about, but the way Warrior is buried here far exceeded my expectations. It is one sided, as you don't get any testimony from the Warrior himself. When the Warrior was last seen in the WWF in 1996, he did leave on such horrible terms, which is one of the reasons why this DVD was made, in a way. I was a fan of the Warrior back in the day. But this DVD kind of surprised me. @ first I wasn't going to purchase it, but I couldn't resist. As for the story here, most of the things I was well aware of, some I wasn't. But it's worth a look in any case. Here's my review of the matches:

Ultimate Warrior vs. Terry Gibbs - Wrestling Challenge 10/24/87, DUD (Warrior's WWF debut, nothing much to say here, except that Warrior absolutely crushes the jobber)

Ultimate Warrior vs. WWF Intercontinental champion The Honky Tonk Man - Summerslam '88, *1/2 (I normally wouldn't give a match of this length that kind of rating, but let's face it, when Warrior defeated Honky Tonk, it was a great moment)

WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs. WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior -Title-For-Title - Wrestlemania VI, ***1/2 (That rating *may be* a little high for some, but looking @ the structure, the hype, the exection, etc, this was a pretty good match considering the wrestlers involved)

WWF Champion The Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude - Steel Cage Match - Summerslam '90, *1/2 (another match where there's nothing to write home about, Warrior creams Rude again)

Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage - Loser Must Retire - Wrestlemania VII, ****1/4 (The best match on this DVD and the best match ever for the Warrior)

Overall, there could've been a better selection of matches. But when you look @ the title of this DVD, the WWE clearly was not going to go out of there way to make this a grand release. Nonetheless, I recommend this DVD in good conscious.",1139184000,3,2128,4.443589743589744
2345370,4,B000A0D1Q0,"I liked it.  I thought the WWE was fair in their analysis of The Ultimate Warrior.  His promos were really funny as hell and off the wall.  For the majority of the people interviewed on this DVD stated they didn't like Warrior, apparently Warrior has/had serious issues. My only beef with this DVD is that I wished the Warrior could provide his own side of the story and took part of this DVD as Bret Hart and Jake The Snake did with theirs. It's worth buying and I hope the WWE comes out with a Ravishing Rick Rude package. A true Warrior fan may not like this because they may feel that it's nothing but a Warrior bash but for me I thought it was fair.",1138838400,,654,4.174603174603175
2345381,2,B000A0D1Q0,"Just watched this DVD and found it to be purely and simply a revenge piece by Vince McMahon against somebody that crossed him in the past. It was completely biased and one sided. The best part of it to me was seeing a match between HHH when he first started in the WWF and comparing him to how he looks today. The guy looked like he weighed 200 pounds. Now after a steady diet of WWE he looks like a huge bodybuilder.

Anyway, this DVD has some good footage and some of it is funny but back in the day of the Ultimate Warrior there were lots of goofey and cartoonish characters in the WWF. This is something that is not pointed out. From what you see on this DVD Jim Hellwig was a jerk, a liar, a scumbag, and a miserable ungrateful person. Nice to see that they were impartial.",1138406400,5,778,4.152317880794702
2345382,3,B000A0D1Q0,"First off let me start by saying the title of this dvd is totally inappropriate. I was a big wrestling fan in the 80s and 90s and next to Hulk Hogan, the Warrior was my favorite wrestler. It's a shame the Warrior was not involved in this project, the WWE went a little too far in putting him down. I found some of the comments from fellow wrestlers and subjects covered to be ridiculous. We all know the Warrior was not the greatest technical wrestler but he brought more to the table. He had charisma and a mystique, his character was like a modern day superhero. They criticized his speeches and interviews and being from ""parts unknown"" Sure he was over the top but that's what wrestlers are supposed to be like. Are you telling me that wrestlers like Stone Cold, the Rock and John Cena aren't over the top and make more sense than the Warrior? At least he was a positive character who didn't have to use profanity or raunchiness like alot of wrestlers today. I don't understand why people like Jim Ross who never worked with him were on this dvd. Bobby Heenan(who can barely talk anymore) and Ted DiBiase had alot of negative comments yet they were never as big as the Warrior. I give credit to Hogan who had class and said some respectable comments about the Warrior.

I have to say that I was annoyed by the Warriors sporadic carrer and felt his wrestling career could have been better had he compromised more with the WWE and WCW. I met him at an apperance in New York city in 2004 and he was a class act.

The dvd could have had more matches but its great to at least have some in the dvd format. This dvd had potential to be some something better but thanks to Vince McMahon it falls short.",1138233600,2,1699,4.339622641509434
2345383,4,B000A0D1Q0,This DVD was very good and very informitive. It takes a look at the Warrior from the eyes of those who worked with him. They take a very fair aproach on discussing the Warrior. The only problem with the DVD is that it more matches. Great DVD for any wrestling fan!,1137715200,2,264,4.196078431372549
2345384,3,B000A0D1Q0,"...you know it's gonna be bad but you can't stop watching it. That basically describes this DVD about the Ultimate Warrior (which resulted in a lawsuit filed today) as it's ALMOST a complete burial on the man. I said it's an ""almost"" burial because certain people like Jericho & Christian did give him his respect on certain issues while people like Edge (who openly said he couldn't be a fan of Warrior's because of his allegiance to Hogan); Dibiase; Heenan; Lawler; McMahon & others just completely have nothing good to say at all. Just about everything about Warrior gets ripped on...ring entrance, wrestling skills, his bad career decisions, his bad attitude towards those in the locker room. His interviews are also touched upon as they focused on one he did leading up to WrestleMania VI (although on the DVD, they say it's the one he did at the event which it wasn't) including Christian doing a funny imitation of it.

The one thing that is very noticeable is how WWE did somethings to make Warrior look worse than he actually did & alter information (showed fliers advertising ""WWF Champion Ultimate Warrior vs. Vader"" when Warrior wasn't champion when Vader was around back in '96), them mocking how he's from Parts Unknown when they currently have characters using that same ""location"" (like Kane) along with the little things he did like shaking the ropes (which Batista currently does as well.)

Anyways, they discuss his time starting as Blade Runner Rock & Dingo Warrior all the way to his beginnings under Ultimate Warrior. His feuds with Hercules, Bobby Heenan in Weasel Suit matches, winning the Intercontinental Championship from Honky Tonk Man, feuds with Andre The Giant (Bobby tells a funny story regarding a match they had) & Rick Rude, the buildup to his match with Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania VI, feuds with Sgt. Slaughter & Randy Savage (who also has some shots taken at him) are covered along with the impact of his Intercontinental & WWE title reigns. It starts to go all downhill from here as they talk about the SummerSlam '91 incident; the name change to Warrior; his two returns to WWE including the train wreck feuds with Papa Shango & Jerry Lawler along with Triple H talking about his WrestleMania XII experience with Warrior; his lawsuit over the ownership of his name; and his short time in WCW including his HORRIBLE (and that's putting it lightly) match with Hollywood Hogan & they even talk about WCW's cheap Warrior ripoff in back in '95 called Renegade (RIP). At least on the positive side, you get some ""urban legends"" about Warrior answered like if there were ever two Ultimate Warriors & why he left WWF the second time.

The DVD extras include the old Warrior University commercial followed by comments by McMahon on a visit to there; Lawler & Dibiase telling stories on the Warrior; Christian doing an old Warrior promo; and two hidden ""Unleash The Warrior"" promos that were done back in '96.

Matches Include:
vs. Terry Gibbs - This was nothing special past Warrior's television debut.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Oct. '87

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Honky Tonk Man - All I can say on this one is don't blink because you'll miss the longest Intercontinental Title reign end in seconds.
SummerSlam '88
(History Of Intercontinental Championship)

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic even down the commentary where Monsoon & Ventura didn't have a ""good guy vs. bad guy"" guideline to follow as the fans being split right down the middle as well.
Wrestlemania VI
(Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology, History Of The WWE Championship)

WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Rick Rude - Warrior's first major challenger for his WWE Championship was the only man to have defeated Warrior over a year earlier for the Intercontinental Championship in the Ravishing One. Rude entered the cage first & made it so Warrior would have to fight through Rude just to get in the cage to start the match. This started out as a slugfest as both men were trading punches more than anything else before Rude was able to get an advantage over Warrior. Rude was more focused on just punishing Warrior instead of winning the championship as he had plenty of chances to just walk out of the cage (as Heenan at ringside kept yelling for him to do) before it eventually backfired on him to the point where even Bobby got involved to help Rude out. Anyone who was around to witness Ultimate Warrior knows that he was very limited in what he could do so this was as good as you expected it to be but still entertaining.
SummerSlam '90

Retirement Match vs. Randy Savage - The loser of this match would be forced to retire from active competition while it was noted before the match that Elizabeth was spotted in the audience which was the first time she's been seen since the previous WrestleMania while it was also acknowledged just by his body language alone how important this match was to Warrior as this was the first time he didn't run to the ring but walked as Warrior started out in control only for Savage to quickly gain it back with Sherri getting her shots in whenever possible as both men traded momentum with the action getting more & more intense as time went on with Savage at one point executing more top rope elbow drops than he ever has before while still kicking out of everything Warrior was throwing at him to the point where even Warrior started to question what his destiny truly was. Without a doubt, Ultimate Warrior's greatest opposition was always Randy Savage & this match is the perfect example as they gave one of the greatest matches (if not THE greatest match) in both men's careers as everyone was on the edge of their seats for over 20 mins.
WrestleMania VII
(Macho Madness: Randy Savage Ultimate Collection)

Collectors Edition Bonus Disc:
vs. Hercules - Ted Dibiase referred to their series of matches as ""the blind leading the blind"" and he had a point here as it was just both men using their power against each other with it sometimes looking every stiff with both men at times looking lost at times too but you could tell that despite all of that, the crowd was still behind Warrior.
""MSG"" Apr. '88

vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This was a rematch from the Royal Rumble earlier in the year as Warrior was dominate early slamming Slaughter off the top rope then constantly knocking him down & to the outside causing Slaughter to resort to dirty tactics along with Gen. Adnan & Col. Mustafa on the outside to regain the advantage & heavily focus on working over Warrior's back as the biggest story behind this match was not only who else decided to come to ringside but what they brought with them that was a big distraction to Warrior.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Apr. '91

vs. WWE Champion Randy Savage - The rematch from their famous WrestleMania VII encounter held under different circumstances with this not only now being for the WWE Championship but also Ric Flair's consultant Mr. Perfect proclaiming for weeks that one of these men had purchased his services for this match (which was heavily showcased in the pre-match footage). Both men came into this match very intense from the handshake to just how they threw off the ring gear getting ready to go as they were even the early moments trading momentum with each having a counter or reversal to the other's offense before each man was able to hurt an area of the body on their opponent such as the lower back with hard whips into the corner & the neck with a piledriver as they just continued to beat each other into exhaustion with either both men catching each other with the same move or kicking out of the other's trademark offensive move to the point where the referee was in the wrong place at the wrong time more than once with the bigger story of the match being Mr. Perfect & Ric Flair revealing just exactly who's side they were on & what their true intentions were. I try not to use the word ""classic"" too much when it comes to Ultimate Warrior matches but is his a lost classic in both men's careers because one of their greatest oppositions were each other as this was a quality match that always gets overshadowed by their encounter over a year earlier as it was very intense & never let up from start to finish.
SummerSlam '92

The purpose & focus was this presentation was to ""bury"" the Warrior which they accomplished so I would recommend this for any Warrior fan to get the truth on SOME (not all) issues regarding him or just to have a laugh at his expense. However, if your a fan of the more serious WWE documentaries then this is one that you should pass on.",1137628800,9,9774,4.6498842592592595
2345385,1,B000A0D1Q0,"Anyone who believes all the one sided tripe on this attempt at character assasination that is this DVD are extremely gullible. I might get alot of flack hereon in for taking the Ultimate Warrior's side in this matter but honestly, can anyone be as crazy and whacked out as the WWE Luminaries on this DVD think he is? Where were all the WWE associates who were and still are on good terms with Warrior like Percy ""Paul Bearer"" Pringle, who incidentally managed Warrior back in the WCCW days when he went as Dingo Warrior. Say what you will about Warrior as a person based on his current speaking career, but don't short change what he did for the sport in the late 80's and early 90's. Just watch any of his matches and you will hear the cheers of the fans as he stormed from the locker rooms out into the arena shaking the ropes like a man on fire, by and large his match with Hulk Hogan being one of his finest hours. It's just a shame that Hulk Hogan can't realize fans like myself not only celebrated Warrior's victory but also in a great match to cap Hogan's career when he had stated it would be his last match at the time. A little humility goes a very long way. What rancors me the most, and this is something alot of you younger wrestling fans might not realize thinking the Ultimate Warrior is a just kook, was how they made a big deal about how he used Parts Unknown as his place of origin. I just have to say give me a break! The Ultimate Warrior knows who he is and where he comes from, and it's not Parts Unknown. That was just a gimmick all wrestlers, especially masked wrestlers, would use to give themselves an air of mystery. Would it have sounded mythic if some fictionalized Conan type wrestling warrior character from another plane of existence stated he was from a place called Mooseneck, Nebraska? I didn't think so. Parts Unknown was as much a gimmick as the Ultimate Warrior character was. Mr. Jim Hellwig aka Warrior does not run around 24 hours a day as his Ultimate Warrior character, however amusing that thought might be, contrary to what the WWE might say in this DVD. I find this one sided, caustic handling of a once very popular, and if you believe the phenomenal sales of this DVD the Ultimate Warrior character himself is still popular in the public's eye, a very debasement of all my childhood memories. Where is a fair and balanced chronicling of the Warrior's career WWE? This is what the Ultimate Warrior's fans want. There's more money to be had by making an unbiased documentary. I just wonder what kind of reaction a negatively charged DVD based on Bret Hart's career would have garnered. And there would have been one if Bret did not step in. Does anyone realize Warrior did want to participate in the making of this DVD but the WWE suits kept playing mind games with him and giving him the runaround? With wrestlers dropping like flies due to their addictions and an elder statesmen of the sport like Ric Flair being arrested for a road rage incident, who do you truly believe is the one self destructing? I can guarentee you it's not the Ultimate Warrior.",1136678400,13,3100,4.469135802469136
2345386,4,B000A0D1Q0,"This dvd is just to make Warrior look bad and gain some money for the WWE. I don't blame Warrior for being pissed about the dvd. They made the dvd without his approval. A lot of people get interviewed basically knocking him non-stop. They talk about his lack of in-ring talent and make fun of how none of his interviews made sense. All that is entertaining though. Especially Bobby the Brain Heenan's interview where he talks about Warrior's matches with Andre the Giant. Jericho is good as well. He handles it as if he's on another VH1 top 80's moments.

  Some more matches should've been included as extras though. WWE needs to realize if they want more money for each dvd....they need more matches. I mean the full entire matches, just not the matches that the interviewers just simply talk about. Hell they could've added Warrior vs Hogan 2 on here for the heck of it. Warrior and Hogan vs Sgt. Slaughter and the Iron Shieke at SummerSlam with Sid as the ref, vs Randy Savage at Summer Slam (World title), vs Earth Quake, vs SGT. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble, Sting and Warrior vs Hogan and Bret Hart on Nitro, Warrior vs Mr. Perfect,  The Warrior, Texas Tornadoe and The Road Warriors vs Mr. Perfect and the Demolition in a Survivor Series match, Warrior and Hogan vs the bad guys left from all the other Survior Series matches at the same Suvivor Series, vs Triple H where he destroys him ""HHH would never let that be on a dvd though!', vs Jerry Lawyler.",1136332800,,1462,4.526515151515151

Now the upcoming pay per view is No way out, sm has no good talents so they have to take Kane to be the main eventer with that stupid champ Batista.

2345388,1,B000A0D1Q0,"Wrestling fans from the early 1990s will remember the phenomenon of the Ultimate Warrior, a wrestler who would come out with a driving guitar theme, painted face, and rope-shaking maniacism. The years have not been kind to the Warrior, he legally changed his name to ""The Warrior"", and is not beloved by his fellow wrestlers.

Now the WWE has released an Ultimate Warrior DVD, ""The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"". This single-disc collection is a waste of money, don't buy, and heck, don't rent it if available.

The ""documentary"" consists of terrible edited segments showing the Warrior acting crazy or disoriented, with various managers and behind-the-scenes people (including Vince McMahon) making disparaging comments about the guy. Sure, the Warrior missed a lot of dates (a no-no for any professional wrestler), and pissed off a lot of people, but this DVD is an insult to fans who want to know more about him.

When Jesse Ventura became governor of Minnesota, Vince McMahon released a similar videotape trashing him, with people like Freddie Blassie being interviewed about what a bum he was. So it was then, so it is now.

A nice extra would have been the inclusion of the Ultimate Warrior's original videotape released in 1990, showing him introducing a number of his greatest fueds with Hercules Hernandez, Rick Rude, and a non-televised (non-title) match with the Macho Man Randy Savage. Instead, you don't get much for your money for this collection, I was very disappointed.

2345389,5,B000A0D1Q0,"THE SELF-DESTRUCTION OF THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR

After being one of the most famous talked about wrestlers in the history of the sport it seemed as if we would never hear about The Warrior again after his short stint in WCW. But ah a form of filmmaking called the documentary as brought to life the memory of one of professional wrestling's most colorful forgotten figures. It seems like yesterday I was seeing the Warrior battle the likes of Ravishing Rick Rude, Andre The Giant, Hulk Hogan, Sgt Slaughter, and The Macho Man {at the time Macho King} Randy Savage. The last one in particular was the most exciting of his feuds, and I in particular was disappointed when The Warrior came out on top. Savage has always been a personal fav of mine, and I wish he had won that feud. But with that bias aside I have always found Warrior to be an entertaining figure.

One of the things I found that interested me the most was that he started out on his own as The Dingo Warrior in Dallas TX. I always knew that Warrior started out his career with Sting, but as a soloist it seems weird that The Ultimate One was once called Dingo. So that was the first surprise to me offered from this documentary, though that was far from the most surprising. One thing I enjoyed most from this DVD was all of the early video footage of Warrior; it seemed weird seeing him in the early stages of the development of his character. They even called him The Dingo Warrior in his earlier matches with WWE {I still say WWF}. The story of how he got the name change from Dingo to Ultimate was some what interesting seeing that Vince did the opposite of what he wanted. If you listen to what is said they say that didn't want another Warrior, since Animal & Hawk, and Kerry Von Eric already had that title in some way. But since he was more energetic, he was that much more ULTIMATE-hence the name. Also I found it interesting that nobody really liked the guy, especially The Weasel Bobby Heenan. The things he said about Warrior surprised the heck out of me, also I loved the footage of the weasel suit match. Also the fact that Andre knocked the crap out of him struck me funny, also a surprise Andre didn't like him. Let me stop and take time to ask a question, if you were the top guy in a major entertainment company, would you risk your career by not performing unless you get more money? Here's a better question would you do it minutes before you had to go on, I wouldn't but this guy did. I absolutely agree with Vince's decision to fire him, but I kinda wish Hogan's idea would have been carried out, because that was mad crooked. But to Vince's credit he gave Warrior another chance as any one who saw WRESTELMANIA 8 would know, as he returned to aid Hulk Hogan. Of course it seems that Warrior had a bit of a drug problem and again he was shown the door. And being the forgiving sole that Vince is he got a third and final chance. We all remember the short lived 96 Warrior who had his own comic book, cussed, and actually spoke were you could understand him {at times}, even wore the out of place cap. But even with victories over Vader, and then I-C Champ Goldust, he still skipped out and refused to show at promoted events. So with that said his glory days of the WWE came to an end, but that wasn't the end of his career. Remember the OWN {One Warrior Nation}, me neither. It took watching his return to wrestling with WCW to remind me. Of course with a name like that, it seems funny that there were TWO members in the ONE Warrior Nation, The Disciple was the second. Watching the footage from Nitro brought me back to that time period, and made me remember how great the hype was but how boring the actual rematch between Warrior & Hogan was. Next question for ya, if you had a history of being fired, and were very unreliable would you want way more money then any company would give you. My answer would be no, I would be happy to be employed in the big time again. So Warrior is gone, but that isn't the surprising thing, that would be his name change. This guy actually changed his legal name to Warrior, what the hell. And in a further attempt to keep his name he sued the WWE for millions for the right to his wrestling identity.

With all that aside the DVD actually has some great moments that highlight the man's career and also some humorous ones as well. Like the Ultimate Warrior's interviews, I actually never really noticed how crazy they were until I revisited them in the form of this documentary. To be honest some of them were actually good and made sense, well at least sounded cool I guess. And also the thing about him being from parts unknown was pretty funny, especially the guest speakers on the film like Jericho and Gene Okarland. But this DVD also includes great moments though out his career, like his classic feud with Randy Savage, his win over Hogan at Wrestlemania 6, and feuds with Rick Rude, Slaughter, and The Million Dollar Man. The DVD also includes 5 matches in their entirety, including Warrior vs, Terry Gibbs on Wrestling Challenge, vs Honky Tonk Man at Summerslam 88 for the I-C title, vs Hogan at Wrestlemania 6 title vs title, vs Rude at Summerslam 90 in a cage for the title, and vs Savage at Wrestlemania 7 in a retirement match.

This is with out a doubt one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time, I recommend it to every body. Also Christian doing the Warrior interview was great.",1132617600,13,5432,4.380574826560951
2345390,2,B000A0D1Q0,"I'm not the most credible reviewer of this DVD, because I don't really remember The Ultimate Warrior.  I remember knowing about him and seeing his promos, but I can't say that I vividly recall any of his matches or speeches (apparently, nobody understood the speeches, either).  From ""WreslteMania XII"" until his run in the WCW is the only time period I can honestly admit to watching The Ultimate Warrior.  So what kind of effect does this DVD documentary have on a viewer like me?  To me, this documentary doesn't seem like such a big deal.

Today's viewers will probably not like this documentary that much.  That's not an insult...but many younger viewers don't seem to really get into yester-year's form of patient and strategic wrestling.  I, too, can admit that I like twice as many matches from this decade than from the 80s and 90s combined.  So, while the trip back to 80s pop culture and sports entertainment was intriguing, for me it wasn't much of an eye-opener.

Listening to younger Superstars (Edge, Christian, and Chris Jericho) is a nice addition to the interviews, because most of those who comment are retired legends (Sergeant Slaughter, Ted DiBiase) and executives (Bruce Prichard, Vince McMahon).  Everybody on this DVD seems to be honest and fair.  What doesn't work, though, is that they tend to get repetitive.  Listening to 10 guys say the exact same thing in a row gets to be grating.  Re-emphasizing points is often more supportive; this documentary makes re-emphasis more annoying, because listening to 10 people with identical points-of-view is too one-sided.  I understand that Jim Hellwig refused to comment on this DVD (though he makes appearances and gives lectures at colleges), but where's the diversity.  The only commentator who throws in a little variety is Chris Jericho, because he admits at the end that The Ultimate Warrior is one his all-time favorites.

But even that last point brings up another problem: This documentary does not convince me that The Ultimate Warrior was that great.  I saw his overly-short matches, which make Goldberg's and John Cena's matches look epic, and was not impressed.  I was into gimmicks as much as everybody else, but Randy Savage and Jake Roberts and Ted DiBiase all put on a spectacular show with their gimmicks.  The Ultimate Warrior simply does not impress me.  His bonus matches aren't even stellar (with the exception of ""WrestleMania VI"" against Hulk Hogan).

I guess what I'm getting at is that if the WWF and WCW were too stupid to learn that Jim Hellwig was in the business for himself and not the fans who made popular, then why listen to 90 minutes of regret and half-assed praise?  What is the tragic rise-and- fall of The Ultimate Warrior supposed to leave me with?  This is where I refer to ""The Rise and Fall of ECW"", and other biographies like ""The Monday Night War"" or ""Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story"".  Those mentioned documentaries had a message, with enough to support either side of the argument, and left us with a satisfactory overview.  ""The Self-Destruction of The Ultimate Warrior"" first gets biographical, then becomes VH-1 comical with a Parts Unknown segment, then frankly insulting The Ultimate Warrior.  What is the WWE trying to do to The Ultimate Warrior?  Jim Hellwig may have destroyed his own legacy, but I wish I could better appreciate what the legacy was.  Then, the tragic fall and career-killing decisions that Hellwig made would be more effective, and perhaps shocking.  But this documentary immediately points out Jim Hellwig's faults, and foreshadows his downfall.

I kind of enjoyed this documentary, but couldn't help but feel shortchanged.  WWE DVD doesn't really double-dip, and even then its more of an overlap of topics than an actual DVD re-release.  But look at it this way - many of The Ultimate Warrior's fans have loved this DVD and feel it was an honest and fair portrait of an 80s WWF Superstar.  I was not a fan of The Ultimate Warrior; I don't recommend the documentary.  It's that simple.",1132358400,4,4033,4.908419497784343
2345425,3,B000A0D1Q0,"I never really liked the Ultimate Warrior character, but the Warrior (whose legal name is now ""Warrior""!) is actually an interesting guy.  Why did Vince McMahon push the Warrior all the way to the top and ride his success for so long?  Obviously, he was a better performer than McMahon would lead you to believe.

McMahon and Hogan shoot away in interviews on this DVD, which are indeed interesting.  It used to be taboo for a wrestler to step totally out of character and talk publicly about the behind the scenes planning of wrestling storylines and matches, so I was pleasantly surprised by the candor of the interviews. Warrior gets ridiculed in this DVD for adopting the name Warrior as his own personal, legal name, and he often gets referred to, disrespectfully it would seem, as ""Jim.""

The matches included aren't very good (Warrior didn't ever do much in the ring), but the match with Savage back in his prime was probably the most entertaining.  The match with Honky Tonk Man has got to be one of the worst title-changing matches of all time.

The title of this DVD - The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior - is misleading, since the Warrior never really did that.  He was just a sort of black sheep, did things his own way, even if nobody else liked him for it.  What's self-destructive about that?",1132272000,4,1316,4.637931034482759
2345426,4,B000A0D1Q0,"The self destruction of the Ultimate Warrior is an interesting DVD in that the advertising for it makes you think every hates the guy.  However upon watching it you realize that is not the case.  In fact some of the guys have respect for the guy (especially the younger crowd), but some do downright hate him.

The DVD chroniclizes the Ultimate Warrior career from his days as one half of the Bladerunners to his final in ring appearance in WCW.  They mostly talk about the character, his promos, and what happened backstage.

However don't expect to hear from the man himself as the Ultimate Warrior had nothing to do with this DVD, and the special features are even less satisfying.  Only a handful of matches.

Overall the documentary is entertaining, but with a lack of special features, and misleading advertising, definetly not their best effort.",1130544000,4,852,4.834482758620689

2345428,5,B000A0D1Q0,I really enjoyed this DVD as most of these profiling DVD releases more than WWE programming. This was about a person I really wanted to hear from the Warrior. The only thing is this I know he was a hard person to work with from what everyone said. But he couldn't have been that big of a dirt bag because he was there for a good amount of years numerious times. Which they do elude to. But do you think it has something to do with the Ultimate Warriors Shoot interview and recent rants the Warrior has been going on about the industry. I think so. Its easy to talk about the guy when he isn't on the DVD. But I will say this the best part is the interview segment. THAT is GREAT !! There should have been more interviews instead of matches they were almost more entertaining. I was glad to see the Ravishing One (R.I.P.) Rick Rude received he never received credit. But if you haven't seen this DVD please check it out and decide for yourself is this the the Warrior or is it abuse of power and a few hurt feelings.,1130371200,3,1015,4.183673469387755

2345430,4,B000A0D1Q0,"""The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"" may seem like a complete bash of the Warrior (real name: Jim Hellwig) at first glance, but once the video gets going, instead provides an honest take on the Warrior, his character, charisma, and his in-ring ability (which, while instantly exciting, was, shall we say, mediocre at best).  Fans of the Warrior may even be pleasantly surprised by what those interviewed had to say about him.

Be warned at first that this is not a biography of Warrior (which is Hellwig's current legal name) as such; it starts out just like the Undertaker's latest DVD epic, with his debut and first matches in the southern wrestling circuits.  There is no background offered on Warrior; there's nothing about how he broke into the business or his occupations previous to wrestling, which seems to be the standard WWE is offering nowadays.  It makes sense, actually; superstars like the Undertaker and the Ultimate Warrior's most popular traits were that they were shrouded in mystery.  That theme is held intact in this DVD.  The scope of time covered here goes through the Warrior's complete career, from his first incarnation as Blade Runner Rock to his final appearance in (and disappearance from) WCW.  WWE will claim to this day that the Warrior was a great concept at first, but as legends like Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Hulk Hogan, and other wrestlers who regularly worked with him tell the tale, it was actually the man, not the character, who self-destructed and caused so many problems for WWE and WCW.  Current WWE superstars such as Chris Jericho, Edge, and Christian also add their reflections on watching the Warrior on the tube in their younger days and what effects he had on them.  They also poke a little fun at the Warrior's cryptic interviews and the downright ridiculous storylines in which he was involved.  From the Wrestlemania X8 DVD, though, we know that seeing Warrior vs. Hogan at Wrestlemania VI as a kid was what made Edge finally decide that he was going to be a wrestler, so at least Warrior made a difference in someone's life.  By the end of the documentary, the truth (according to WWE) is revealed as to how the Warrior was so successful.

For the most part, I was pleased with how the story of the Warrior and his ""downfall"" was presented, and thought that those interviewed were both honest and sincere about their opinions.  Parts of the doc brought back memories of the Warrior's most...well, memorable...moments, and brought a few laughs as well.  I found myself wondering why I was so into the Warrior as a kid, but I know I wasn't alone.  The documentary is just over 1  hours long, and is just informative enough without getting boring at all.  Extra features on the disc include additional short interviews with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and Ted DiBiase, Christian hilariously reenacting of one of Warrior's most disturbing promos, and 5 full matches (two of which are less than a minute long-what a surprise), including Hogan/ Warrior from Wrestlemania VI and the Retirement Match vs. ""Macho King"" Randy Savage, both classics.

Warrior fans will probably dig this DVD, and if you're an old-school wrestling fan like me who pines after the days when colorful characters were more important than shock TV, you'll relive some good stuff here.",1129766400,3,3327,4.889679715302491
2345431,4,B000A0D1Q0,"I was a pretty big UW fan as a child. But it didn't compare to being a Hogan fan. Regardless, I think this dvd was really well done from a production and editing standpoint. It was extremely comical. Although it obviously was at the UW's expence, and was a blatent attempt to bury the UW and his character forever. It still brought me back to a time where phoney names for wrestlers was the way to get over. Current WWE talent looking back on the UW's character was beyond funny, and have WWE Hall Of Famers, as well as Mr. McMahon looking back on the UW really brought into perspective what ""Jim"" or later leagally known as the UW was like. Backstage, and in ring. I just hope WWE doesn't decide to make ""burrying"" DVDs a habit. It was funny now and truthfull at the same time, but eventually would make the WWE look like an unforgiving bully in the wrestling industry. But overall it was a good DVD and very worth the price of purchase.",1129507200,,938,4.3352272727272725
2345432,5,B000A0D1Q0,I really can't believe that the man himself the Ultimate Warrior didn't want to share his side of his own story this dvd is talking about him when he first started in the WWF. Vence Mcman was glad he fired him. The Ultimate Warrior had a match with Hulk Hogan back in 1990 at Wrestle Mania for the worlf Heavyweight championship Hogan lost to the warrior. The Warrior came to WCW to face Hogan when he was in the NWO he stayed for a while then left never to be seen again. In the WWF the Ultimate Warrior kept on fighting the undertaker the undertaker put him in a casket buared him underground they dig him up and the warrior was throwing up green stuff.,1129161600,,655,4.248
2345433,4,B000A0D1Q0,"One question: why is Jim Ross providing some commentary as if he was with the WWF at the time of the Ultimate Warrior? Ross was with the NWA at the time.

  Other than that, what the DVD says about the Ultimate Warrior may be true.  However, notice everyone on it giving commentary is still in good graces with the WWE.  Just something to think about.  I'm not trying to imply the DVD is full of lies - just spin.",1129075200,3,413,4.1645569620253164
2345434,5,B000A0D1Q0,"I just purchased ""The Self-Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior"" and I must say I kind of expected a complete ripping of the Warrior but I didn't get that! I've read where other reviewers thought the WWE was being unfair and biased on this one but I don't get that vibe at all. I think, for the most part, the assessment of UW was fair and probably pretty accurate.

I do have to raise an eyebrow at a couple of things though. The first was Triple H. Granted, it was an old interview from 2000 the day of WrestleMania 2000 but I find it kind of ironic that he calls UW a ""d*ckwad"" since most fans tend to consider him the same (though I have to grudgingly admit he's far more talented that UW ever was).

Back to the DVD itself, the bio is about an hour and a half long. I found Vince McMahon to be very informative in his explanation of his relationship with UW. Still have to wonder like a lot of fans WHY WOULD YOU KEEP BRINGING THIS GUY BACK KNOWING HIS REP?!

I found the comments from Chris Jericho, Christian and even Edge to be very funny! The best UW story though had to be Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan's description of UW's matches with the late, great Andre The Giant! I won't give it away but it was quite humorous! I only wished they would have had the footage of that bout with the incident he described on this DVD! LOL!

I also wonder how sincere Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan's explanation was for bringing in UW to the old WCW. They said it wasn't to give Hogan a victory over UW thus giving him peace of his old WrestleMania VI loss to him. I don't quite buy that since Eric Bischoff was really kissing Hogan's a** majorly at that time! As it turns out, UW was another nail in the coffin for WCW since by the time they brought him in in 1998, WWE (WWF at the time) had taken back the Monday Night Wars! Do have to agree with Bischoff though that Hogan/Warrior II was the WORST MATCH on that Halloween Havoc card! It really stunk up that joint that night!

I should also note that this originally was set out to be a tribute to UW and he was even asked to participate in its making but he not only refused, he totally slammed WWE in doing so! So for all those that say this piece is biased, I say this: UW WAS OFFERED THE CHANCE TO TELL HIS SIDE OF THE STORY FOR THIS THING SO HE HAS NO ONE TO BLAME BUT HIMSELF IF THE DVD SEEMS ONE-SIDED!

I have to confess I was also a fan of UW and it was kind of sad to see him fall apart like he did when he practically had the world at his feet but on the other hand, he did it to himself for the most part. Like it or not, WWE (in my opinion) did make him as well as the other superstars (particularly Rick Rude and Randy Savage). As they say, you reap what you sow. Still, his impact on wrestling in the early 90's cannot be denied.

Anyway, overall, I think whether you are a fan or not of The Ultimate Warrior, this DVD is worth the money to watch whether you agree with what's said on here or not.

As for the bonus bouts, here they are:

MATCHES
Vs. Terry Gibbs - A squash match.

Vs. The Honky Tonk Man - His I-C title win over HTM in 31 seconds!

Vs. ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude (RIP) - This is their SummerSlam '90 cage bout for the WWE title!

Vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE VS. I-C Title Match) - The historic WrestleMania 6 match up!

Vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage - The WrestleMania VII ""retirement"" match

BONUS FEATURES
-Jerry Lawler tells of a story wrestling UW in Memphis

-Vince McMahon recounts Warrior's failed Warrior University school

-Ted DiBiase recounts an autograph session with UW in WCW.

NEW INFORMATION:
  Well, probably not new by now but I only recently found out that there are TWO versions of this DVD. The first one is the one all the reviewers discussed but the other has the original disc PLUS a bonus disc only sold by FYE stores! On that disc are three more matches with UW:

Vs. Hercules - This was from Madison Square Garden and took place weeks after their PPV encounter at WrestleMania IV (1988). In my opinion, this bout is what their WM match should've been with a great finish!

Vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This is from the old NBC show ""Saturday Night's Main Event."" In addition to Col. Mustafa (The Iron Shiek) and Gen. Adnan, it also features run-ins from Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker!

Vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage (WWE Title Match) - This is a rematch of sorts from WrestleMania VII. Their last PPV bout was the retirement match from that bout in 1991. This SummerSlam rematch was in 1992 from England! Was just as good as their WM bout. Features run-ins from ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair and ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig (RIP).",1128729600,4,4600,4.233142857142857
2345466,2,B000A0D1Q0,"This certainly has divided wrestling fans !
For those that don't know, Warrior himself refused to take part in this 'documentary' so what we have is Vince (the owner) and current employees giving their (ha ha) 'impartial' views.
Here are my (I believe) impartial thoughts.

The first half is actually very good. And is generally fair and balanced. The only negative comment being that his wrestling wasn't very good and that initially in WWE he was kept off TV so he wouldn't be exposed. This is a fair comment, his early WWE is not up to what he did a few years later, and you can only imagine how bad he was when he first got there.

They have a long section on his music and ring entrance which is great. It was a VERY important part of the character and it was good to see it broken down and people discussing the various points.

They detail his feud with Ric Rude. I don't think its an unfair comment to say Warrior learnt a lot during his feud with Ric Rude. I'd go further than that and say Rude MADE Warrior the wrestler we know and love. Looking at Warrior pre-Rude WM5 and post Rude Summerslam 89, as a wrestler he moved forward light years. Rude also provided the template for how guys should wrestle Warrior. I found it odd they never showed Summerslam 89 as this was really what set Warrior over the top in my opinion.

They also look at his feud with Andre the Giant. The parts about Andre you have to look at closely. Everyone claimed that Andre didn't like Warrior. This isn't inconsistent with what Warrior says. Warrior says Andre liked his CHARACTER and how much work he put it into it, and that's why he agreed to work with him and put him over.

They of course go over the lead up to and the Wrestlemania 6 match and the Hogan match, which is considered the pinnacle of his career by about 99% of wrestling fans. They also cover Wrestlemania 7 in detail and the retirement match with Randy Savage. Its fun to see people discussing Randy/Warrior and the fact neither one of them made any sense!

I really liked the part on his promos. They were bizarre and SO out there. That's part of why everyone loved the character. They should have shown a lot more of them.

The 2nd half - post Summerslam 91 - is when things got really negative.

It was funny to see them talk about in his comeback he hadn't been going to the gym as religiously and was a lot more smaller.

The comment about failing a drug test though and being let go in 92 is bordering close to slander. Especially if what Warrior says on his website is true - that the court documents from the court case show he never failed the test, and that Vince tried to use him as a scapegoat in the early 90s steroid trials.

Vince is Vince though, and that's to be expected. Vince doesn't really often lie, to paraphrase Obi Wan, what he says is generally true from a certain point of view. He states Warrior held him up for money. I guess you could say Warrior held him up for money in that he demanded to be paid what he was owed for Wrestlemania 7 (almost 6 months prior). That's very different from demanding an instant payrise which is what is implied. I guess you could say Vince 'forgave' him when he brought him back in 92. Vince doesn't point out Warrior wasn't asking for forgiveness and Vince never actually said Warrior asked to come back. He is good at skirting around truth. Vince is Vince.

It was strange when they talked about losing momentum because of his absence. Maybe initially, but I guess that's why Summerslam 92 was never mentioned. Hard to claim he'd lost momentum when you show a stadium of 80000+ going wild.

Most of what they say about his 96 return is true. If you watch the matches, the crowd is a lot quieter in previous years. And Warrior does look like he is phoning in his matches. He doesn't look very interested in being there. He is more interested in his comic book and Warrior University. It is strange to here Vince admit that his father did die and that was the reason given for missing house shows, but then claim that's not a good enough excuse because he hadn't seen his father in years!. Bizarre to say the least!. Maybe it hit him hard that he'd never forgiven his father for leaving. Maybe he wanted to grieve that he'd left it so long to make up. Who knows, but it was weird for Vince to claim it wasn't a valid excuse. Especially from a company notorious for switching and changing house show matches at short notice.

Ultimate Warrior has taken a lot of flak for his rebuttal against Bobby Hennan on his website. After actually watching the doco, I think he was too NICE with his comments toward Bobby Hennan. Heenan was tearing him a new hole WAY above and beyond what was necessary. And some of his comments were so far off the map it was amazing. He really came across as a nasty piece of work. Warrior didn't check if he was okay after the gorilla press ?. Should he have stopped mid match and broke character !?  And 1 second after he says 'in that match he dropped me on my face', they play the clip where he gets dropped on his back.

Sgt Slaughter came across as a tad delusional. Some of what he was saying actually sounded like an Ultimate Warrior promo. 'Riding the wild stallion', 'taming it or breaking it', 'learning through punishment'. I'm surprised he didn't stare at his hands, and snort between sentences.

I was shocked at Hogan throughout the doco. He was very complimentary and didn't really have that much negative to say.
He seemed embarrassed at the 'Sheik, break his legs comment!"" when questioned on it (in reference to Summerslam 91 and Warrior refusing to go on). Interesting to note he didn't as the head of the locker room decide to do it himself....The comment was probably said in the heat of the moment, and was something he didn't mean, so I don't think its that bad.
He was the only one who stood up for Warrior in regard to the name change, saying 'when you play a character so long, a little piece of it is in your heart, and I can respect that'.
He does mention that in Warriors return interview in WCW in 98 it was 'big no-no' to mention Wrestlemania 6. Hogan talks about how furious he was, and 'you just don't do that'. Since when ? How is that a bad thing ? Referencing previous matches is done all the time. He also took the blame for their Halloween Havoc 98 match being horrible. Very shocked he did that!
The only negative comment he had really was 'I don't want to be the one to say I told you so' in regard to Warrior not being able to follow his act as world champion. Although that came across as extremely cocky, it is a valid point. NO ONE has been able to follow Hogans act.

Jericho, Edge and Christian are all very complimentary towards the Ultimate Warrior character.

I've lost all respect for Ted Dibiase who is supposed to be a born again Christian. He actually says he had no personal problems with the Warrior, and states that Warrior respected him and his in ring ability and listed to his advice during their feud. Despite Ted admitting this, he spends the entire documentary bagging the guy out. Classy Ted, did Jesus tell you to do that?...or Vince ?

Mean Gene while interesting at times, just flat out lied at others. He claimed ratings on Nitro sunk during Warriors debut. I mean come on, numbers are still available for ratings in that period, and its a well known fact that Warriors quarter hour return is one of the highest rated segments ever (it may actually be number 1, I know it was for a while, not sure if it still is). To claim the exact opposite on camera is just pathetic.

Ric Flair had some very negative things to say, especially about Warrior taking the WWE to court. But if we look closer at it, I think Flair can be given some benefit of the doubt. He didn't even know that Warrior took the WWE to court until the interviewer told him. That's kind of surprising, its not like its not well known. Following that logic, he may not have actually known that the intellectual property was around before the WWE run. If he did, I don't think he would have been disgusted.

HHH I thought actually came across as sympathetic instead of arrogant. He basically said that he was a young wrestler at the time and Warrior ruined his first Wrestlemania experience for him. Its a fair comment. There was no need to squash him that badly. I've heard Warrior's reasoning on the shoot DVD but I still think he went too far. He could have thrown HHH out of the ring with the gorilla press (Rick Rude style) and then chased him around a bit to lengthen the match while still looking strong in his return. I remember watching WM12 and being all excited about seeing Warrior, then being disappointed he was only there for a minute.

The doco does end giving credit to Warrior, making his mark on wrestling history, and admitting he will be forever remembered.
It was fun to see the trademark of Ultimate Creations bit on screen at the end, showing Warrior won the court case and owns his character.

So, the Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior, or just the self destruction of dignity from middle aged WWE employees ?
I can only laugh at another reviewer who stated that everyone is obviously speaking from their hearts and believes what they are saying.

I don't look at Warrior through rose colored glasses but all in all, I'd give it 2.5 stars out of 5. Although some parts were good, and some negative criticisms were valid, seeing so many grown men lie on record gave me a queasy feeling.",1128470400,7,9491,4.416475972540046
2345467,3,B000A0D1Q0,"I purchased this DVD to add to my WWE archives. I had almost forgotten how much I liked the Warrior back when he flattened Honky Tonk Man in 30 seconds, but I soon remembered how the last nail in the coffin of my ""UW fan"" status was pounded in when I heard he actually changed his name to ""Warrior"".  I mean come on, let's at least keep some grip on reality, and not believe our own hype too much. That being said, the matches are enjoyable, although there definitely could have been much more added to them. To just have a small handful of matches on here, and not to mention that they are the ones we've probably all seen before, doesn't really do the package justice. I know the WWE may not care if they do justice to UW, but they should do justice to us, the fan, in terms of what we're paying to buy the thing. It should be packed to the gills with matches and interviews and such. But, it's really a good DVD set for what it is. I'm sure if UW had come down off the moon for a while and actually helped out with it, it would be a much better package, as we'll hopefully see evidence of with the Bret Hart set due out soon. The only MAJOR gripe (and scary prediction) I have has already been mentioned by others - the removal of Jesse Ventura from commentary. I'm sorry but this is complete garbage! The match sounds completely ridiculous with Gorilla talking to himself. Fans want to buy the matches and events they remember fondly, and WWE may not want to admit it, but Jesse's commentary is a HUGE part of enjoying those old events, in my opinion. It's a bad pattern... they have a beef with the Warrior, so the DVD isn't quite as good as it could be... they have a beef with Ventura, so the product and the fans suffer as a result. Vince is a genius businessman, he has to realize that the fans/product suffer as a result of these squabbles. As for the previously mentioned scary prediction... Jesse Ventura did commentary on Wrestlemania 6, and how many others? I can't remember well enough to say. There is a huge Wrestlemania DVD box set due out soon. Does this mean that his commentary will be stripped from ALL of those shows? That would absolutely RUIN them, in my opinion. Every patch of dead silence will only serve to remind you that you are robbed of hearing Jesse's commentary and that the shows have been changed from what you remember. The flow and enjoyability of them will be shot to hell. If I can't hear Jesse sing the praises of King Kong Bundy putting the ""Big Kabosh"" on a midget at Mania 3, it's just not worth having.",1128470400,,2548,4.308333333333334
2345468,4,B000A0D1Q0,"The warrior was a great wrestler and although when I was young I watched a lot of his matches in the 80s and thought he was a superhero.  Shoot I thought the same thing about Sting who trained with the Warrior but the only difference was that Sting did a lot better with his success and his career then the Warrior did.  Sting became an icon and a legend in his own right becoming known as the Franchise a title which he still keeps to this day even after the WWE bought WCW Sting chose not to come over like Flair did.  It is a shame though that a lot of wrestlers didn't have much respect for the Warrior although he did do a lot for the business in the 80s when Hogan was out with injuries.  I just wished his career would have ended on a better note then it did.  This dvd should be interesting although I haven't watched it yet and I am hoping it has a one of the best matches in the Warrior's career the match with Hogan at Wrestlemania which showcased both wrestler's styles so well and also a passing of the torch by Hogan to the Warrior.  They should have gotten an interview for this dvd from Sting, and Road Warrior Animal who traveled the road with the Warrior in the early parts of his career and probably knew the man the best.",1128384000,,1241,4.15
2345469,4,B000A0D1Q0,"Anyone who followed pro wrestling in the early - mid 1990s already knows that the cartoonishly painted and muscled Ultimate Warrior (born Jim Hellwig) was self-destructive.  The man quit the business three times and never seemed to stay-put in the World Wrestling Federation for more than a few months at at time.  The interesting thing about this DVD is it provides insight into just HOW self-destructive the man now known simply as ""Warrior"" was.  Gathering interviews from other wrestlers (Hulk Hogan, Triple H, Ric Flair) as well as commentators such as Mean Gene Okerlund and Vince McMahon, this DVD tracks the intense career of the Ultimate Warrior and shows that the man just wasn't able to handle the quick success.  It's that evolution, rather than the wrestler himself, that make this an enjoyable package.

At times, the documentary seems like it's almost out-to-get the Warrior and it is blatantly and unapologetically one-sided.  Yet it is captivating nonetheless.  There are also several matches included that basically show the evolution of the Ultimate Warrior's in-ring style and persona.  He was a mediocre wrestler at best, but made up for his lack of technical skill with a super-hero persona that was a huge hit with the fans. He was far from ""The Next Hulk Hogan"" as the wrestling industry hoped.  But he certainly had his own style worthy of study.

The only complaint with the DVD is, like all WWE DVDs, the matches.  They are interesting but they definitely leave you wishing for more.  Frankly, they could have included twice as many matches on the DVD.",1128384000,,1579,4.961977186311787

However, in the last third or so, it does become rather unrelenting negative in its portrayal of the guy, and it would've been better if he had been given the opportunity to give his side of the story.

Then again, having read some of the nonsense he's spewed in recent years, he does seem a little 'off', and it would've probably been quite difficult to get anything worthwhile from him. If anything, having him rant about himself on this DVD might've ended up making him look worse.

2345473,1,B000A0D1Q0,I've not seen this dvd yet.  This is one I'm staying away from.  For as long as I've watched wrestling and bought video's and dvd's I can't stand this man.  The only way I'd watch this is if my friend burned me a copy of the two dvd's.  I'm glad McMahon fired Warrior from the WWE,1128297600,,280,3.9464285714285716
2345474,5,B000A0D1Q0,"One of my favorite era's in WWF history is during the Ultimate Warrior's 1st run. I still get chills & my heart races watching the closing moments of WrestleMania VI. ""The Self-Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior"" is brutally honest. It takes a look at Jim Hellwig's career, touching on his start with Steve 'Sting' Borden as the 'Dingo' Warrior, & his various stints in other minor promotions before calling the WWF for a job. It covers some of the aspects of the Warrior that made him unique & appealing, like his ring enterances, & his extremely un-understandable interviews. Most of his major rivaleries & high spots are looked at, like Rick Rude, Andre The Giant, Bobby Heenan (who provides some awesome stories & insight though-out the DVD), his quick raise to the Intercontinental Title, his historic WWF Heavyweight Title victory, & other topics like why he left the WWF 3 times, his brief run in WCW, his horrible rematch against Hogan at 'Halloween Havoc', & more.

Extras include 5 matches:

Vs Terry Gibbs (debut match - note: no music, & he WALKS to the ring)

Vs Honky Tonk Man (SummerSlam 88, if you've never seen it, don't blink or you'll miss it)

Vs Hulk Hogan (WrestleMania VI, Title for Title)

Vs Rick Rude (SummerSlam 90, Steel Cage)

Vs Randy Savage (WrestleMania VII, 'Loser Must Retire' Match)

& some stories:

-Jerry Lawler tells a Warrior story from Memphis

-a promo for Warrior University

-Christian impersonates the Ultimate Warrior

-Ted DiBiase tells about an autograph signing with Warrior

Plus 2 hidden extras - both Warrior promos -

- In chapters, left click 'The Name Change' for 'Unleash the Warrior'

- In extra's, right click 'Warrior University' for 'The Journey Begins'

I bought the FYE exclusive, which contains a bonus DVD with 3 more matches:

Vs Hercules (MSG - 4/25/88)

Vs Sgt. Slaughter (Saturday Nights Main Event, 4/27/91)

Vs Randy Savage (SummerSlam 92)

- In a recent 'Ross Report' on WWE.com, a fan mentions 2 hidden extra's on the bonus disc. No hidden extras are on mine, so if anyone has any info on these extra's (perhaps another exclusive set), please post it as to where it's sold or where it is on the disc.

Anyway, very highly recommended. Warrior fans will appreciate it, non-Warrior fans will love it.",1128211200,21,2271,4.83419689119171
2345475,4,B000A0D1Q0,"Although some folks have painted this DVD as a total hatchet-job on the Ultimate Warrior, it is actually a fairly balanced record of the Ultimate Warrior's strengths, i.e. charisma and connecting with the marks and his weaknesses, i.e. bad business sense, poor social skills, inablity to performing wrestling moves.

The WWF marketing machine worked full-time to cover the Ultimate Warriors weaknesses while he was in their employ.  Now that he is no longer with them, and they are no longer covering his flaws, his limited strengths pale in comparison to his failings.",1128124800,,569,5.173913043478261
8071254,1,B000A0D1Q0,"This dvd should have been recalled years ago.  Ill be glad when it finally goes out of print.  The Ultimate Warrior was, is and always will be the greatest wrestler of all time.  This dvd is a disgrace to anyone who has ever stepped foot into a squared circle and/or cheered on those who have.  RIP Warrior.",1525132800,,307,4.333333333333333

8071261,5,B000A0D1Q0,Great movie. Always loved this one versus the other ultimate warrior movies because it talks about him honestly. Sometimes too brutal but still a good watch for a bit of the behind the scenes of the wrestling world,1460160000,,214,4.657894736842105
