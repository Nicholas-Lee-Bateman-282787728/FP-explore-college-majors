4445267,3,B004QDW2EO,"""You shall die, to be re-born as my art.""  When single mother Christie (Swain) leaves her job on Christmas Eve night she is attacked by the Picasso Killer (Kier) on her way home.  After running to the nearest building and the cops show up she thinks she is safe.  Soon she and everyone else realizes that no one is safe, anywhere.  This movie started off really exciting and terrifying, then steadily slowed down until the end.  The killer went from being really frightning to a little unbelievable.  I will admit that Udo Kier kept up the creepy factor the whole time though. Much like ""Silence Of The Lambs"" the killer skins his kills and turns it into ""Art"".  Some of the scenes are pretty graphic, but nothing that seems to over the top.  I felt the movie had much more potential, and had a chance to be really good and creepy but never got to where it needed to.  Overall not a bad movie, but could have been so much better. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.",1307664000,2,991,4.279569892473118
8438063,2,B004QDW2EO,"Christie (Dominique Swain) leaves work to walk home on Christmas eve (didn't really factor in) and sees the Picasso Killer (Udo Kier) who has proved himself a nuisance for the city as he carves up women. Christie is let into the locked Hitchcock building. A couple of police show up and there are a few people working late.

They get trapped inside a building with the phone lines cut. They can't get out, but the killer can get in. No one owns a cell phone, maybe this was the 1990's judging by the computer, but I don't recall anything setting the date. And when trapped inside a building with a killer, the best thing to do for the motion picture is to divide up. We know who is the final girl and if you wonder where the title came from, wait.

They attempted to make the killer into something with a small amount of background, but they failed to give him a good screen personality.

8438064,4,B004QDW2EO,"*Probably has all kinds of spoilers*:

This film  ""Fall Down Dead"" was actually pretty good. The characters were not exaggerated nor over written. Sometimes they can come off cartoonish or not so believable. David Carradine did somewhat but luckily his characters presence was short. The heroin played by Dominique Araine, who is a single mother living with her young daughter and a female roommate accidentally walks up on one of the Picasso Killers scenes while he is still doing his thing. He immediately sees her as the woman of his true inspiration and chases her into an office building during the city's rolling blackouts. She has it rough! First a bum she gives coffee too because it is Christmas Eve and she fills sorry for him tries to steal her purse after she gets off work then a serial killer takes a liking to her and hunts her down.

Now this would make a perfect Christmas film for future holidays because it does happen on Christmas Eve. Anyway, lady has to fight for her life because the killer gets into the building with her, two cops that were supposed to be on a drug bust but decided to call it a night when the call came in about a killing, the security guard played by Carradine-who is like the worlds oldest slacker rent a cop, and three employees of the buildings business.

So one by one the killer without much ado or dialog takes out the sheeple . The deaths are gory and in your face. The Picasso Killer is only artistic when it comes to his muses in this pic. The others just get slash-o-rama treatment familiar in any horror film. This film is a great slasher and serial killer style flick reminiscent of many 80's styled films like ""New York Ripper"". This film is a good thriller based film with descent acting and slasher styled gore so I say watch it and enjoy!",1438646400,,1798,4.523076923076923
8438065,1,B004QDW2EO,"Fall Down Dead does in fact, fall down and dies.  The world of potential with a promising storyline somehow gets destroyed with terrible acting.  This acting is unforgivably atrocious.  Everyone from the woman at the diner, to the cops, to the homeless man outside... everyone delivers poorly executed lines and isn't the least bit believable in saying them.  I wasn't sure if the idiot cop stumbling to open the front doors of his station (while a screaming girl is right outside begging the cop to let her in) was a clumsy oaf in taking his time to find the right set of keys, or if he was just acting so badly that he couldn't help it.

To make matters worse, this particular scene was overlong by a good 20 seconds.  The woman was RIGHT outside the door while the cop was taking his time (which by the way, actually WAS a solid convincing scream on the part of the girl- the only adequate piece of acting in the film) and we can even SEE the girl begging for her life through the glass because somebody was after her.  It's really brutal to watch.

The other cops that eventually enter the building act just as poorly, and the storyline execution is overlong in every situation that arises throughout the film thereby killing all potential for suspense.  Highly recommended to avoid this one folks.  Long, drawn out, and lacks suspense.  It never improves.",1345075200,,1360,4.601659751037344
8438066,1,B004QDW2EO,Ouch.  This one hurts worse than most.  Checked it out hoping for a decent horror sleeper with a name or two I recognized.  Looks like Carradine must have walked off the set abruptly (since he is in it for 1.0 minutes) after seeing this shlock director drive this titanic into the film iceberg...  Only reason I waste time on this review is to save some other poor hopeless saps.  One of the worst films in the last 10 years.,1329868800,,425,4.329113924050633
8438067,1,B004QDW2EO,"Anyone proficient in Horror 101 knows that a horror movie should never be slow and/or padded with useless dialogue or extended suspense scenes that aren't suspenseful.
These are just some of the failures in FALL DOWN DEAD.  Here's an outline of some other examples:
PLOT - Hard to believe.  Why does The Picasso Killer have a pencil sketch of Christie, a girl he's never met?  How does a 70 year old killer overpower much younger and stronger victims, including our two hero cops?  These two cops have the combined intelligence of a slug.  Why didn't they take Christie to the police station for her witness statement instead of holding up in the office building?  Knowing the killer is nearby and no help is possible?  There's more but I don't like to spoil things for future viewers/victims.
ACTING:  Dominique Swan starts out well, but the script manages to reduce her character to a boring, wailing clich.  The two cops whose names I deliberately forget, are just plain awful.  Period.  The late David Carradine has a mercifully brief role as the wanna-be-a-real cop security guard.  And then there's veteran character actor Udo Kier who not only chews up the scenery but devours it gleefully---and acts like he's loving every minute of it.  It's really bad---shame on Udo!
Jeers to make-up artist (?) Starr Jones for laughably bad make-up.
FALL DOWN DEAD does just that and with a giant thud.",1309824000,,1397,4.843881856540085
8438068,2,B004QDW2EO,"While the concept of Udo Kier as a horrific serial killer who chooses his victims to express his ""art"" sounds promising, the execution end up lacking. There is something about the notion of Udo Kier, at his age, being capable of running around, slashing and in this movie killing his way through his victims. I did like the main setup, of a group of relative strangers, stranded in a dark building, being hunted by a sadistic killer. Sadly, other issues derail what was a promising movie.

For starters, the script was obviously written by somebody who knew nothing about police procedures. Not many cops would choose to hole up in a building, with a killer, instead of using their superior firepower and numbers to either get to safety, or track him down and kill him. Instead, in the name of a generic horror movie, they chose to split up, the better to allow them to be picked off one by one. This is a case where suspension of disbelief becomes impossible after about the tenth stupid decision by the characters. While I can accept this to a certain extent, it became far too prevalent to ignore.

Dominique Swain was probably the one bright light to be had here as she gave yet another consistently solid performance, particularly for being in such a poorly scripted movie. David Carradine was so goofy and over-the-top, that the whole bumbling night security guard role he was portraying became a lesson in overacting. The rest of the cast ran the gamut from bad acting, to uninspired and I wasn't able to make a connection with any of them. Udo Kier is always creepy and can say anything in a chilling fashion, sadly in this case his dialogue was mostly drivel and his presence was anything but terrifying. He would be walking with his blade out in once scene, only to have to pull it from his pocket and re-open it in the next frame.

The movie had a run time of one hour and thirty-three minutes, which felt about 10-15 minutes too long. The pacing felt off and the ending was cheesy and fairly anti-climactic. To ask the audience to believe you could be thrown off a building and simply walk away? This was not a supernatural slasher film and it felt out of place within the confines of the movie that I watched. If you want to see this, give it a rental, but avoid the purchase.",1309737600,,2289,4.5375302663438255
8438069,1,B004QDW2EO,"I love horror movies. I always have. When I was a kid I'd love to sneak out and watch the late show knowing full well that I'd be frightened and thrilled. I've seen all sorts of horror films, good and bad and even so bad they're good films. But it angers me to find a movie that takes money that could have been better spent on a half decent film wasted on a piece of drek like FALL DOWN DEAD.

If the fact that it was clich filled were all I might be more forgiving. But this movie has it all when it comes to bad. Bad directing, bad acting, bad writing...just bad.

The story revolves around Christie Wallace (Dominique Swain), a waitress in an all night diner working hard to save up money so she can move out of the city with her daughter. At the same time we have a concurrent tale going on about a serial killer who takes his victims and uses body parts from them in his attempt to create a piece of ""art"" played by Udo Kier.

After work on Christmas Eve, Christie accidentally comes across Kier and his latest victim staked out on top of a dumpster and sliced and diced. He sees Christie and immediately decides she has the perfect skin for his masterpiece and attempts to kill her as well. Instead, she drops her purse (oops so much for anonymity) and runs for the nearest building.

She convinces the bumbling night watchman (David Carradine completely wasted here) to let her in. They call for help but the two cops are on hand just moments before the power goes out in the building. For some reason the power has been going out all over town in various spots. Okay, I can get this point in the summer with air conditioners and all but Christmas Eve power outages? Come on.

The killer is in the building and it isn't long before he starts trying to rack up a victim count. A couple of cheating spouses on an upper floor are brought downstairs and that's when the killer starts.

There is the slim possibility of a story here and one that could be scary. Instead we have long winded meandering conversations between characters that we don't get to know and actually don't care about. It's as if the writer thought ""Hey, Kevin Smith gets kudos for having great dialogue, I think I'll do it here"", never realizing that there must be a certain amount of action in a horror film as well. To cap it off the few action scenes there are with Kier make you wonder how a geriatric serial killer has the ability to catch people let alone take them on when facing them.

This is one of those movies that even when watched with your finger on the fast forward button you're bored. Far too predictable and far to long winded to be enjoyed on any level. Avoid this one at all costs.",1308960000,4,2678,4.322709163346613
8438070,1,B004QDW2EO,"I just screened this in the store for some of my B-movie horror fans hoping there could be a nice Carradine sleeper here, but this one turned out as bad as the planted reviews here and elsewhere. SIDE BAR: I know Amazon asks to not talk about other reviews here - but both of the glowing write-ups are by the producer of the film and another one-time reviewer.

The mixed-up story follows a serial killer (played by Udo Kier, who is usually great but this was his worst role to date - though this film did come out four years ago) as he stalks his victims in some abandoned city. Abandoned except for Mr. Carradine's security guard and some bad acting cops. It was great to see Carradine again and he deliberately plays the role in his own cheesy way; even when he ""gets the axe"" customers were laughing at how bad the paper/cardboard axe looked. The story muddles into some bad monologues and very long sequences of empty staircases and ""edgy"" camera angling.

The picture quality was average and the sound was an arguable 5.1 with subs in Spanish and English. There are no special features and the cover art pushes this as one of Carradine's ""final roles"" - completely false as he has 25 films completed since this one. Skipper all the way.",1307836800,10,1242,4.515555555555555
8438071,5,B004QDW2EO,"Keeping it short but sweet. If you're a fan of Hitchcock you will love this. The suspense is constant. The acting is spot on and, the directing is right on the money. Don't miss this one you will be pleasantly surprised.",1307836800,,220,4.390243902439025
8438072,5,B004QDW2EO,"Hello, I just wanted everyone to know that yes I did indeed produce this film awhile ago in NC in the summer but you should really buy, rent or download this film please.  We basically took over the town at night, was tough but fun.  Everyone from the cast and crew were fantastic, the city was wonderful as well.  I'd go back there in a heartbeat to make another film, but I just wanted to thank everyone that worked on the film.  Thank for you all your hard work and I hope you enjoy the film.

Now for the review: this is a lower budgeted horror thriller but worth checking out because it looks like a big budget movie thanks to everyone that worked on it - from the sets, costumes, effects and our director of photography who worked on many major studio feature films.  The acting is good and the talent are attractive, the suspense is right on due to the acting, writing, directing and music.  You will not be able to guess the ending, so I urge you to check this film out - very cool, creepy, sexy horror thriller that had and has lots of blood, sweat and years that went into it in order to get it made.",1307836800,,1110,4.2075471698113205
