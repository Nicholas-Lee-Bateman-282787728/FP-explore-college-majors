5275572,5,B00979JV00,"This DVD set is a real treat as it includes all 24 episodes to date. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each from the second and third, plus the 2011 Christmas special which was arguably the best single episode so far; it was certainly one of the most dramatic!

The three series so far have taken us from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to 1921. The circumstances surrounding each series have been in contrast with each other. The first series ran up to the start of the First World War, and the one of the main thrusts of the story line was the matchmaking within the Crawley family and the various financial and social influences on the choice of a suitable partner.

The second series moves on to the war years, when Downton Abbey had been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. The time setting is from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. This background contributes to some very interesting scripts, and whilst some felt that it did not live up to the first series, personally I thought it was excellent, but different.

The Christmas special and the third series take place from late 1919 into 1921. The first features a very dramatic trial, and in the third series the household is far more back to the life of an aristocratic family as it was in the first series although the estate faces major challenges in the post war period and a need to embrace change if Downton is to survive. A major feature of the show is the interaction between the family and those who serve them `below stairs' and there are many strong performances amongst both groups. However, a review of Downton would not be complete without mention of Maggie Smith who, as Violet has some very funny lines and dominates every scene she is in. Shirley Maclaine was introduced in the third series, presumably as a foil to Violet and presumably to please American viewers, and the rather frosty relationship between the two worked very well.

I am sure that there will be few viewers who have not seen Downton, which is the most successful costume drama since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago. However if there are any out there this will be an excellent introduction to the show for them. Even if, like me, you have seen every episode to date you will enjoy revisiting them. Although this is the definitive box set to date, purchasers should be aware that there will be another 2 hour Christmas Special in 2012. I imagine that this set was rushed out to take advantage of the Christmas trade, but it is a shame it was not delayed for a couple of months so that it could include the 2012 Christmas Special. It has now been announced that there will be a fourth series followed by a 2013 Christmas Special.

For those of you interested in extra features, this set includes what was included in the individual DVDs for Series 1,2 and 3. This amounts to over three hours of additional material!",1353196800,15,2944,4.568181818181818

It is filled with drama, sadness, happiness and every other emotion.  The wardrobes are wonderful and the setting is superb.  Maggie Smith is delightful in her role and all the actors do a great job.

5275617,1,B00979JV00,"Don't buy this set.  There are many scenes that don't make sense because so many key episodes are missing, like Edith's wedding where she is stood up by her fiance. The scene where Sybil dies is missing.  The end of disc 2 in season 3 shows Bates in jail reading letters from Anna, and she in her bed reading his letters.  The beginning of disc 3 shows Bates back at the abbey as if he had never left.  These are just 3 of many missing scenes.  Really frustrating when you put in a lot of time to watch the show and without knowing much about it, it is really obvious so much has been left out.  I was left scratching my head many times and compared notes with my sister and she filled me in.",1452297600,2,692,4.088888888888889

Season 1 beautifully illustrates the world of an Upstairs / Downstairs estate; however, the characters really shine. The Dowager Countess's one-liners can make the grumpiest of people laugh. However, Michelle Dockery's performance as Lady Mary Crawley makes the whole show. Lady Mary shines in seasons 2-3.

Very disappointing to be watching and have the disc not play correctly.
Amazon did replace the first set, but not without a bit of complaining on my part because it was past the 90 day purchase date.

All the actors provide convincing performances.  The drama brings all the variations of life that can happen - both good and bad to the family and servants.  Maggie Smith, particularly gives good performances.  She also seems to have the best lines.",1401667200,,418,4.830985915492958

5276055,5,B00979JV00,"Up until two months ago hadn't even viewed Downton Abbey.  Have heard much about the series but for whatever reason hadn't tuned in.  First went to local library and checked out the first season.  As soon as I popped the first disc into the recorder, I was hooked. The characters are so true and real to the person(s) they are portraying. Love the early vintage clothing.  Last but not least, the magnificent Downton Abbey estate.  The story just moves along, pulls you at once into the program and the characters.  After viewing all four seasons, I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could make a purchase as this series is something to have and hand down to my grandchildren.  I'm excited to view the upcoming series in January 2015.

I enjoyed how the series doesn't just focus on the Abbey family but the staff/servants as well because each one of them has a story in their own to share because each one holds a certain status in the Downton Abbey famly.",1398124800,,962,4.520231213872832

5276087,5,B00979JV00,"My husband and I are late-comers to Downton Abbey.....we kept hearing people talk about how good it was, and I tried to find it online or on PBS so we could start from season 1, but it was nowhere to be found.  Soooo, I just bit the bullet and ordered this set of DVD's.  We started watching and it was ok -the first couple of episodes seemed to be getting to know the characters and things like that.  We also love Foyle's War and noticed it does the same thing, then BANG all of a sudden by the 3rd episode you find yourself drawn in, paying a little closer attention, and then looking forward to the next episode.  (Is this somewhat normal for British tv?).  We literally watched this set (all 3 seasons) within a week.  Every spare evening or weekend we did nothing but watch as we couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Outstanding acting, the characters are divine (for example the man who plays Carson is probably the most PERFECT actor in a role I have ever seen), and of course the costumes and setting are spectacular.  The story lines are believable, everything is authentic down to the most minute detail, and you get to know the characters so well you almost feel as if they are real friends in your life.  It is a rare thing when I start to personally care about characters on a television show, but Downton Abbey has successfully captured me.  Another part of the shows brilliance is Maggie Smith.  Her character is a hoot and we love it when she says something under her breath or in a way we know it is meant as an insult, but she does it with such class we often burst out laughing.  I only hope Downton Abbey will be around for many years.  Now that I am hooked, I can't imagine not watching it.  If you are looking for a show that is highly entertaining, has drama, emotions, gut-wrenching tragedy, comedy, and some of the best quality ever on tv, then this is a must for you.",1396742400,,1899,4.342776203966006

5276089,4,B00979JV00,"I loved the series.  But when I bought this set as a used set, there was a fairly large gouge in the second disc of season 1 that made it very difficult to watch.  I am wondering why they chose to sell the disc, as the scratch was quite obvious at a glance.",1396742400,,257,3.830188679245283
5276090,5,B00979JV00,"I love this series. It was so nice to order through Amazon. I've gotten where I avoid going from store to store. Invariably, I come home empty handed.

5276115,5,B00979JV00,"The writing, the acting, the period perspectives and the music are each a contributing factor in our repeated enjoyment of this set. Even though we knew what would happen after our first viewing, there are nuances to discover and details that slip past that make the story fresh each time. And what a great way to indulge the voyeur in ourselves, seeing how the rich lived and spent their time.

We own a few DVDs that we have watched more than once, but never experienced that desire to start over again at the beginning and watch the whole series again right away.

Of course, I then wanted to find out how the characters got to where they now are, and see what happened to those mentioned by name, but no longer on the show. Found this deal on Amazon to be too good to pass up. Loved being able to watch the series without having to wait for breaks between the seasons. I was one who benefited from the unusually harsh winter. Having several ""snow day cancellations"" from work, I was able to watch show after show. There was so much more I should have been doing while home from work, but it's not often I take ""me"" time, so talked myself into being selfish.

Problem I'm having is Season 2 and Season 3 disk keep stopping and starting, if you watch it again it will stop and start in a different place.

Based on other reviews it seems that some people are receiving complete sets with no missing episodes but there were also a few complaints about missing scenes and episodes so I'm definitely not alone. Buyer beware.  Amazon provided a full refund and I re-ordered each season individually (the original BBC versions, just to be on the safe side).",1393891200,5,605,4.8173076923076925

  If you loved this series take a look at ""Upstairs Downstairs"" which has a similar premise to Downton and a classic back in the 70s. that ran for 78 episodes. That series sells for more that $100 and one version was over $300. Just shop around carefully and you will find more reasonable prices.

5276347,4,B00979JV00,"Amazon sent for review of product to see where the deleted scenes were.  They have updated the site and now shows that the deleted scenes are on the bonus dvd.  This is a 5 star program with the material on the bonus dvd the only negative.  Amazon holds the product available for the deleted material and hopefully will use it more fully to their advantage in the future by placing the deleted material in the running of the program itself on any future Deluxe Limited Editions.  These were shown in the run time of the program on my PBS station before the showing of season 4 but are not available this way through them.  So Amazon if you are listening please take advantage of this marketing exclusive that you and you alone have.  I believe like me many other customers would repurchase this series if you made it available in this way.  I hope to see it available in the fall of this year when you come out with 1,2,3 & 4.

5276360,5,B00979JV00,"I never expected this series to rate so highly, especially with my husband. He is recovering from surgery and Downton Abby has been a life saver. We generally watch two sessions instead of our intended one.  We are watching the three seasons for the second time. I must order season four. All of the actors are fantastic; love the ones who are good and dislike the ones who lack scruples. The costumes are gorgeous, can't say enough for the color and scenery. Granny's one liners are precious. Maggie Smiths expressions are priceless. The filmers and editors deserve credit as well. Of course the series would not exist without the writers and the use of Highclere Castle. Thanks so much to all who are responsible for the making of Downton Abby. What a team!",1392508800,,759,4.706766917293233

5276363,5,B00979JV00,"All I can say is that I love this series. I've come to get to know the characters like distant friends, and that says a great deal about how the creators of this show can bring empathy and interest to both the highest social classes of the UK as well as their servants. We get to peak inside a word where we would not normally have access in our wildest dreams. It offers an escape, because their world is so ordered and settled -- it's a great escape when I out one of these DVDs into my player and go to another world.",1392508800,,520,4.058252427184466

I've seen some reviews complaining that it seems like scenes were left out. I can only assume that these reviewers first watched the show on an American PBS station, because American stations added some scenes when they broadcast the episodes. These DVDs are the original British versions, and they are exactly as I remember watching them the first time. I remain absolutely delighted!",1392508800,,489,5.049382716049383

5276372,5,B00979JV00,"I found myself do involved and intrigued by both the family and the servants of ""Downton Abbey"". This has such historical value as it shows the British evolution during and after the first world war. It explains how so many of their society's conventions came about (the national Health service supplanted the Royals paying for their servants' and tenants' health care) when so many estates were sold off..",1392336000,,406,4.985294117647059

Having the discs means I can watch as much as I want without having to wait a week for a new episode. Also, the first 2 seasons on Netflix are not in HD. Can't say enough!!!",1392336000,,325,4.09375
5276380,5,B00979JV00,"Classic Pre-World War I, World War I, and Post-World War I period drama set in a wonderfully opulent English castle with a cast of characters that are believable and human.  Class structure and changing mores challenge the characters at the turn of the 20CE in a beautifully acted and executed series of plots and subplots.  This TV Series draws one into the lives of the Duke, Duchess, their young and lively yet maturing daughters, and their multitude of service staff.  Excellent video buy with backstage extras.",1392249600,,515,4.965116279069767

I am a real TV and movie buff, and think this series to be one of the best productions ever done in either media.  The writing is great; with character development well-done.  I feel I know and care about all the characters.  The production value, set design, and costume design are very good.  We later sent for Season Four, and are well into it now.
I highly recommend this series.",1392249600,,475,4.413793103448276

5276384,5,B00979JV00,"I'm absolutely addicted to this show! I would recommend it to anyone interested in this time period. The story line is very interesting and a lot cleaner than most shows these days. It still has it's quick moments of ""questionable"" material that are there to simply support the story, but the story and plot does not center around the one thing that our society today seems to focus so much on.",1392163200,,394,4.563380281690141

Year after year I've watched this series with it's plot twists and turns and caught all the reruns I could until I realized that this is so engrossing that I had to have it. It never gets dull or boring, British accents and all, and there are villains enough to keep you on your toes. It's as fast-moving as any American series and has variety enough for anyone. I love it. I had to have it. And now it's mine. YAAAAY DOWNTON ABBEY!!!!!",1391990400,,522,4.23

I've been wondering for a long time why the quality of movies seems to have lagged so behind many of the films and actors of the past.  Everything I found lacking has been brought together beautifully.  Now I'm  getting into the fourth season with great enthusiasm.  I hope it goes on forever.",1391990400,,614,4.315789473684211

So, I had heard about this BBC series from friends, and only lauded my utmost gratitude for almost anything that is BBC-sponsored.  I broke down before the New Year, and watched the first two seasons on Netflix.  I immediately knew that I needed MORE!  The thought of almost twenty cast members being wonderfully depicted in a memorable and engaging manner was pure genius.  The writing is clever, but the delivery is infused with a subtle slyness that keeps you amused and transfixed.  I will enjoy re-watching this for years to come.",1391990400,,666,4.849557522123894

5276421,5,B00979JV00,"I am an avid Historical Fiction fan, and this series introduced me personally to early twentieth-century,  English landed gentry and their ""downstairs"" staff. I became entwined in the tragedy, recovery, and celebration of those on all levels of the household through before the Great War and its aftermath to the brink of the Roaring Twenties.

I bought the three-season boxed set because I had watched season one online but couldn't find the next two. I had become hooked and needed to find out what was happening to the characters above and below the stairs.

This is part of the Masterpiece Theater series and is exquisitely done. The scenery is as lush and opulent as the decors of the Abby and the authentic period costumes. This set also includes a documentary of Highclear Castle, the actual location of filming, which we also found very interesting. The variety of British accents can be hard to follow until you get used to the cadence of each characters' speech. Fascinating!",1391904000,,985,4.921686746987952

Other reviews for this set mentioned that it was not the complete series, but they are wrong. This set includes every episode from seasons 1, 2, and 3, even the Christmas specials. I only wish it would have come with an insert listing the episodes and a short summary so that I could keep track of where I was, but I suppose that is what mobile internet is for! Overall, this show is a delight! I have laughed, I have cried, and I have begun to long for more ""proper"" times.",1391644800,,559,4.333333333333333
5276442,5,B00979JV00,"This was worth every penny! I had not watched this series but did hear that it was good. So, after seeing a special on PBS, I decided to see what I could find on Amazon. I was thrilled as it had all the special features and bonus DVDs to enhance the program. My cousin and I have had the best time wandering through the series a few hours each week, having our own tea and discussions on everything Downton. Do yourself a favor and watch this with someone you love! The only drawback I could find is the titles of the episodes could have been laid out better. Don't let that stop you!

(At least to me.)  The many sub-plots and main plots with their unexpected twists and turns have kept me alert and observant of how the actions impact the many characters.
Do I wish for a ""fairy-tale"" ending -- of course.  Do I find a much more absorbing and interesting story with unexpected twists and turns -- definitely!",1391212800,,488,4.855421686746988

I recommend to anyone with an interest in early 1900's English history. My only complaint, which is not uncommon for me, is that certain voices (particularly female voices) are difficult for me to understand given a partial hearing loss and I was missing a lot of the dialogue despite having the television turned up to a level that most people would consider excessive. We solved that problem by purchasing a set of wireless headsets so that my wife can listen at normal volume, and with the aid of the headsets, so can I.

Of course, I had heard so much about Downton Abbey, and it seemed like it would be right up my alley.  I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER WITH A GIFT! The price for Season 1-3, which included bonus material, was an amazing $51! It is very cool to see the actors' interviews, listen to the director's thoughts, and learn some insider stuff (did you know that ""Edith's"" outfit she wore when she drove the tractor for the farmer consisted of trousers from Meryl Streep on ""Out of Africa""??). The quality of the DVDs is fine, and it is packaged well. My order arrived within the timeframe promised, and I was able to get free shipping because it was over $50.

Purchased this set as a Christmas present for my Mom and we ended up watching the entire DVD set together.  It was a lovely treat!  Even seeing again those episodes I watched on ""regular"" t.v. was great, because it gave me the opportunity to pick up on dialogue and situations I seemed to have missed the first go-round.  LOVE this showgorgeous, classy, and a reminder that life (and people) were once more mannered & genteel (even the ""downstairs"" folk).  Only negative part of this set is the so-called ""bonus disc"" which is only about 10 minutes long and has a few snippets of interviews with only 4 of the show's actors. There were some cute anecdotes about filming the show, but overall, it's not much of a ""bonus"".

As a result, I returned this item since she did not need it.",1390521600,,334,4.0606060606060606
5276543,5,B00979JV00,"I had not seen any of the Downtown Abbey shows for the first three seasons, so I ordered this DVD collection.

My wife and I have had numerous very enjoyable nights watching the different episodes.  This series is simply the best I have seen in many years.  We have now watched each episode of the first 3 years at least two times.  The second time you pick out things that you did not see the first time.

The castings, beginning with Maggie Smith, are just fabulous, as each actor plays his or her part very well.  The scenes are packed with lots of images, and the action is fast.  There are heart throbbing love stories, and many plots an sub plots in each episode.

I completely recommend this series to anyone who would like to watch an interesting and very compelling drama.  I have ordered season four, even though I am watching it on PBS as the shows come out.  I expect to enjoy Season 4's shows as well, but the Bates and Anna issues seem unnecessary in year 4.

If you are looking for some great TV, try Downton.  I did am am very, very pleased with the DVDs.",1390435200,,1071,4.3

5276547,5,B00979JV00,"I received this season 1-3 box set for Christmas from my lovely daughter-in-law. Even though I trust her taste in television shows, I really wasn't expecting to like the series. I took out one disc just so I could say I tried watching...and I was immediately enthralled.

What a wonderful series! It has become one of my favorites of all time. Gorgeous costumes, exemplary acting, an engrossing view of the titled English and the downstairs staff, history unfolding before our eyes.

Funny, sad and all emotions in between, the show has kept me guessing as I've watched all the shows of the first three seasons - and I have Season Four on order. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates fine programming.",1390348800,2,712,4.780487804878049

We have now watched 5 programs and can't wait to watch the rest.  It is a very informative series of early Americans who lived in well to do families and the customs of those matriarchal families.  It gives an idea of living through the turmoil of world events such as WWI.  We can't wait to see the rest.,1390348800,,447,4.103448275862069

5276557,5,B00979JV00,"We spent Christmas vacation watching it with the whole Manson family. Charles and Squeaky got a bit agitated during the prison scenes, but laughed out loud during the WW I part, especially when a round went right through a soldiers head!

5276562,2,B00979JV00,"The set I received had a few problems.  These were:
  1.  One of the discs was marred.  It would freeze, lines would appear across the screen, etc.
  2.  I ordered the U.K. version, but many of the discs were the American version.  The American
  version had commercials, Laura Linney, etc.
  3.  None of the discs identified the episode #'s on the disc.  In fact, the Season 1 set, did not identify the Season on the disc
  and the episodes #'s.
On the plus side, when I reported this to Amazon's customer service and said I wanted to return the set, the representative notified  the seller who said that, since the fault was in the product they sent, it would not be necessary to return it and that they would give me a full credit.  They have done this.
I also ordered the U.K. version of Season 4 which is scheduled for shipment later this month.  I hope none of the above problems are on this set.",1390176000,,902,4.319277108433735

This was falsely advertised as the full original presentation, not a poorly abridged copy.

how to watch the purchased series but haven't had a chance to watch them.
I read the reviews after opening t he pkg and am sure I will not enjoy the series since your advertising
stated that all 3 seasons would be showing and DID NOT stipulate that only partial series were in the
sets.  I also didn't like that so many complained that they had problems with the disks.  I'm glad we got
the seasons on sale, but hesitate to watch them since all of the series will not be there.  I would not have

I could not wait to watch the subsequent Seasons 2 and 3, and now I am eagerly awaiting the return of the show tomorrow night January 5.

Downton Abbey is intelligent, accurate, filled with believable characters who capture your heart or annoy you.  The acting is superb, and the scripts are refreshing and leave one wanting more.  My personal hope is that the program will go on forever, but I know at some point like all good series it will end.  I hope not too soon, and I recommend this to anyone who prefers intelligent, tasteful, informative television instead of the current assortment of poorly written, many times crude, programs written for people of low standards and low I.Q.'s.

5276772,5,B00979JV00,"I heard this series was good but I think it is great! The costumes, set, character development, and plot lines are interesting and the plot twists kept me coming back for more,",1388361600,,176,4.53125
5276773,5,B00979JV00,"Many here have written detailed reviews about the characters, their interactions, the period clothing and customsall true.
The reason I'm writing a review, is that I was unprepared for how this drama series drew me in, made me misplace my priorities in tv channel selection and sucked this guy into its plot so that I CAN'T NOT WATCH IT.
Look, I'm a normal working guy who flies heavy metal equipment around and I initially needed a little help with how the relationships in the series fit together.  I'm so hooked that now I'm telling my wife: ""Keep an eye on those two, I KNOW what's going to happen!""
Well maybe not exactly, but the way Sir Julian develops and interweaves the characters is sometimes predictable, but just when you think you KNOW what's gonna happen he has a twist that flat gives you that, ""Well I'll be "" feeling.
Short of the long, I LOVE watching this with my wife.  You know guys, chicks dig it when you spend time with them and actually enjoy the same show they enjoy!
I'm not a real smart guy on these kinds of things, 'cause I love Moonshining, American Hogger, Duck Commander and Gold Rush to give you a general idea of the IQ it takes to watch the shows I like. Downton Abbey is the best drama series I've ever watched.  I can't wait to see the next one with my wife.  The way the Abbey service staff works with the royalty and amongst each other is riveting and at once fascinating!!
So will I watch the Alamo Bowl (Oregon/Texas) tonight or Downton Abbey? I played football and love my Oregon team, and I will watch the bowl game, but you can be assured that right after I'll watch Downton Abbey.  The character strengths and weaknesses of each actor helps me to see more clearly the kind of person that I want to be.  Bates is my man and I so respect him.a Man's man, men!

Some have said the PBS version is missing some stuff and they know because they compared both versions.  Well, they've got a lot more free time than I do apparently.  All I know is that I'm flat hooked and I cannot wait to see the next one.  I have to admit, the gay scene made me nauseous and I would have preferred it to be left out.  (In spite of the current trend in our country, it's still repulsive to many men, including me).  Other than that, I've enjoyed every moment of the series.

So put down the remote, grab a beer, or in my case a tea (gotta drink that a lot now with the Baroness you knowmy wife!), lay down your man card and get you some Downton Abbey.  I'm betting that you'll be hooked too!

(I'll try to remember to update this when I've seen it through the upcoming Season 4).",1388361600,,2603,4.305327868852459

5276777,5,B00979JV00,"No superheroes, no action or explosions, just great writing and action, and GREAT stories.  I never watched seasons one and two because I thought this show would be just too boring.  But then I said, OK, I will watch the first episode just to see what all of the hub-bub is about.  HOOKED!  Went through seasons one through three in a week, and now with this DVD series I'm doing it all again before season four debuts in the U.S.  The story and acting is so great that you can watch this show over and over again and enjoy it just as you did when you watched it the first time.",1388275200,,578,4.171171171171171
