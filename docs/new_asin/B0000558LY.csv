7931207,4,B0000558LY,"Eyes of Texas, 1948 film

A rider approaches Camp Cameron, a camp for boys whose fathers gave the supreme sacrifice for love of country. A bell sounds for dinner. The rider has a message for Thad Cameron - his nephew is alive and well! Thad will change his will. On his way back to town Thad is attacked by four big canines! This is a scheme by two villains. A man rides into town, he finds a conflict at the stable. This US Marshal visits a doctor. [There is comedy here.] Roy is checking on Thads death from an attack by wolves. There is a song at Camp Cameron. Lawyer Waters says the Will left the ranch to nephew Frank. Wolves were sighted on Timber Ridge. Roy chases one and lassos it. Its a dog! Its been shot. They will rescue it. Word of this gets to Lawyer Waters.

The dog Lobo doesnt like Waters. Roy halted the insurance payment on Thads death. Waters wants to remove Roy as US Marshal. Roy arrives at this meeting and shows his anger and opposition! This unites the people against him. Waters captures Lobo. A group of men escorts Roy out of town. Cookie the doctor leaves to follow them. Trigger stops a horse and rescues Roy. The men chase Roy! They capture and beat him, four against one. Cookie arrives to rescue Roy with his revolver. Later Roy explains his scheme to him. Waters explains her swindle - she has a substitute for the dead Frank Cameron! He came from prison. There is a party that night, with a song. Frank talks about his military record in the Phillippines, and Iwo Jima. But the Fifth Army took Italy, a telling mistake. Roy says Thad was murdered, this nephew is a fake; he has a plan.

Frank tries to mount a horse from the wrong side! There is a dinner at Camp Cameron. Frank leaves for a meeting with Waters. But Frank gets greedy and is punished. Waters will pay of that Citizens Committee. But there is a surprise and a fight. Roy visits Waters to follow Frank. There is a surprise, the dogs chase Roy. They corner Roy, but Lobo helps Roy escape. The plot was discovered, the gang will escape after they collect their money in town. Waters holds a gun on the nurse until Lobo enters to turn the tables. Shes not faking this time. Waters men go into town, there is conflict and shooting! Roy follows into the stable. Gunfire starts a fire in the baled hay. The fire is extinguished. There should be a happy ending.

This is a novel and complex story about an attempted swindle of a mans property. The events from WW II are used as part of this story. I think this story came from one of the Western novels popular in those days. The story ends, you hope things will work out. Note the warning against signing a blank sheet of paper that will authorize an unwritten will. [Where was Dale Evans when this movie was made?] The character of the chief crook is unusual. That baled hay suggests post-war farming (instead of loose hay piled with a pitchfork). US Marshals usually had jurisdiction in Federal Territories (as in the 19th century) that were not part of a state. A marshal in a city or town was elected, unlike appointed police chiefs. It was part of a democratic tradition, the Militia of the First Republic (1776-1876). The soldiers in a militia elected their officers for a one-year term. Colonel Davy Crockett was a good example.",1468195200,,3279,4.441860465116279

You may guess who the leader of the bad guys is right off, but you do wonder who else is involved in the plot to steal the ranch. When Roy is kidnapped at gunpoint, it is Trigger and Doc Bullfincher to the rescue.",1370563200,3,347,4.117647058823529

7931214,4,B0000558LY,"In this 1948 Roy Rogers western, ranch owner Thaddeus Cameron (Francis Ford) has turned the place into a home for orphaned boys who lost their fathers in World War II.  However, the old man's lawyer, Hattie Waters (Nana Bryant), wants to take over the place, so while she bakes cakes for the boys she conspires with Cameron's long-lost nephew to take over the place.  In her basement she has a secret kennel full of killer dogs that she has been starving just so they get really mean.  It is up to U.S. Marshall Roy Rogers to save the day, if only he can survive being bullwhipped by one of Nana's henchmen.  ""Eyes of Texas"" is interesting because the villain is a woman, who conveniently drops dead before Roy has to get violent with her at the end.  This 1948 film was directed by William Whitney, and co-stars Lynne Roberts as Fanny Thatcher, the female lead (What?  Where's Dale, Roy?) and good old Andy Devine as Cookie Bullfincher, the town doctor.  ""Eyes of Texas"" has less singing than most of Roy's films and certainly the subject matter is more serious.  For that reason, I am willing to make some allowances for the absence of Dale Evans in this movie.",992563200,9,1163,4.5576923076923075
