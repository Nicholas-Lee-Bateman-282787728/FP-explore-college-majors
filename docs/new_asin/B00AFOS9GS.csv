8551007,5,B00AFOS9GS,"The visuals were powerful and imaginative, not merely realistic. Wagner would have been proud. Hagen nearly stole the show, as a tormented, mighty villain, but Siegfried--Jay Hunter Morris--had already stolen it. He was the perfect Siegfried: beautiful singing, a charming combination of innocence and manliness, and a seemingly effortless stage presence, ranging from romantic to playful, to tragic.

Unlike some of Wagner's work, this one is never static, often melodic, and always gripping.",1371945600,12,644,5.861702127659575
