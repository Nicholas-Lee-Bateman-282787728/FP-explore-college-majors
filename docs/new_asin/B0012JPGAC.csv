8326036,5,B0012JPGAC,"I spent 15 years with Mike Austin as a student and friend.  I was introduced to Golf by my dad at age 9.  At age 51 I met Mike and a long drive for me was 250 yds.  After about 3 months with Mike I hit my first 300 yd. drive on a golf course.  The 5 par hole was 500 yds. long and my ball was resting on the blue (200 yds to the center of the green) fairway marker in the center of the fairway..  At 75 years old after watching ""Secrets"" again I hit a tee shot 258 yds last Saturday.",1459814400,,483,3.605769230769231
