8058834,5,B0009AFFQU,"This DVD is a ""talking head"" narrative by Richard Heinberg. Heinberg summarizes the key points from his books on peak oil (Powerdown and The Party's Over). If you've read either of these books, you'll find the DVD material familiar and the presentation concise. I have found that for friends and family who are unaware of the peak oil implications and not necessarily willing to read a book on the subject, the DVD is an excellent way to introduce them to the subject.

The video quality of the DVD is fine. There are frequent quick cuts as Heinberg speaks which I initially found mildly distracting but soon was able to ignore. I assume it was the DVD producer's attempt to keep the spoken narrative concise--perhaps they editing out most of the ""umms"" and other pauses you'd expect in the spoken word. In any case the video and sound quality is good.

Some unique content on the DVD includes Heinberg explaining how he and his family personally are preparing to the transition to a more energy-poor future, including where they chose to live, and the even the kinds of plants they have in their back yard. In fact this scene was filmed in his back yard.

For Heinberg fans, this DVD will be an excellent addition to your library and you may find it especially helpful in introducing the subject of peak oil to others.",1131753600,5,1319,4.652360515021459
