1603106,4,B00005JO1R,"Any movie about Johnny Cash is doomed from the start, because the man's charisma can't be captured by any living actor. Joaquin Phoenix does a workmanly job, but he doesn't have it, no more than Val Kilmer did in trying to play Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors. And both movies make the same mistakes, focusing on the star's personal failings rather than the art, and in simplistic reductions of the artistic impulse to early childhood, Morrison's Indians on dawn's highway dying, Cash's older saintly brother sliced in two by a circular saw while Johnny was out fishing. No, the artistic impulse comes from deeper waters. The saving grace of this movie is Reese Witherspoon, who does June Carter better than June Carter herself could do. She pulls this movie out of the gutter like she tried to pull Johnny out of addiction, so, yes, it's worth watching, but don't think because you've seen it that you understand The Man in Black.",1517011200,,940,4.773006134969325

1603165,5,B00005JO1R,"I have always enjoyed both Johnny and June. But I was not too interested in their lives. And I have to admit that this film was a bit depressing at first. It reminded me too much of Steinbeck. I started to question my purchase when before I could finish the thought, I was sucked into their life and this movie. This adds a new perspective on the classic songs. We see that they were just people and subject to personalities and environments as we all are.

You will find these songs going through your head days after viewing this movie. Note at the ending credits the real thing as the real duo sings ""Long Legged Guitar Pickin' Man""",1506211200,3,635,4.38135593220339

1603211,2,B00005JO1R,"This is not a very good movie.

 Joaquin Phoenix is not a good actor. He is ugly (hare lip, bad features, small round shouldered body, etc.) But the major defect he has in this role is that he has almost no voice. I kept waiting for them to break into the part of this kind of movie where they review the singer's great hits. But Phoenix simply isn't a singer. If the real Johnny Cash had that voice and charisma - no one would have ever heard of him.

After he has his break through and becomes an established star we see him sink into depravity. This section is not entertaining. It's just depressing.",1497830400,,603,4.271929824561403

1603223,5,B00005JO1R,"Loved it! Became a Johnny Cash and June Carter Music Fan after this Movie......Wow!  Amazing acting, amazing chemistry between the two leads and fantastic music.  The soundtrack is great! This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is a must-see.  I love learning where Johnny Cash got his start, understanding his emotional pain stemmed from the loss of his brother during childhood years, and seeing how that plus stardom caused the emotional adult baggage he carried around.  I loved the love story-  seeing the relationship between him and June Carter unfold from friendliness, to sexual attraction, to friendship, and into true love.  She was a true friend when he needed someone the most.  Beautiful story.  I do believe they were soul mates.  They died four months apart, too - as if one couldn't live without the other.....I have always wished that our two stars of this movie would make another CD together - they sound great together - and I almost prefer hearing them sing then the original Johnny Cash and June Carter.  But I love the originals as well.......See this movie and enjoy!",1496534400,,1103,4.8449197860962565

Timeline though a little hard to follow ; in this reviewers opinion, the ""real"" June was absolutely Gaga over Johnny and was not a feminist ; Johnny was screwed up on drugs for about 3 years - movie too often makes him look like a lifelong junkie ; movie shows him as sympathetic to prison inmates but not a spokesman for the Native American , and this is absent in the movie. Plus, we get nothing about the amazingly prolific poet and original , musical stylist .
A little less of the typical ""long suffering lady and the guy who doesn't get it"" and we have a nearly perfect movie.

1603252,1,B00005JO1R,The film was fantastic and I loved every moment of it.. Every moment I could hear anyways. The issue was not with the film but with the digital copy quality.  I have ordered numerous films and shows digitally on amazon  and very rarely ever have an issue.  The audio quality on this was just awful.  It was so quiet that I had to turn the subtitles on just to understand what anyone was saying even though I had the Amazon and my computer volume all the way up.  It was a bit of a bummer because the movie had a lot of music in it which I wasn't able to fully enjoy because of the low volume and poor sound quality.

1603279,4,B00005JO1R,"Released in early 2005 and directed by James Mangold, Walk the Line is a biopic of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix): His rise to fame, his travails with alcohol & drugs, his first marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and his ever-tightening relationship with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Robert Patrick (the T-1000 from Terminator 2) and Shelby Lynne play Johnnys parents.

This is a solid drama that naturally works better for people interested in the inimitable Cash. The first two acts are decent, but nothing great. However, I pleasantly found myself really entering into the story with the third act, which focused on Johnny in his self-made pit of despair and his angel of deliverance, June. I don't have a problem with Phoenix playing the musical icon, except that he was a full half a foot shorter than the towering Cash. Witherspoon is a nice fit for the humble June who was decent-looking, but by no means some hot starlet. In the movie, Vivian (as played by Goodwin) is clearly hotter than Witherspoon.  In real-life Vivian was Italian American with an exotic look; she obviously had a splash of African blood running through her veins (nothing wrong with that, of course).

Some criticize the movies portrayal of Cash & his guys auditioning for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records the same day Johnny worked up the courage to visit the studio in Memphis, hoping to get a recording contract. While they did audition for Phillips and scored a record contract it wasn't the same day and they didn't play Folsom Prison Blues, but a less incendiary song, 'Hey Porter. However, it is true that, after auditioning with mostly gospel songs, Phillips told Cash that he didn't record gospel music any longer because it wasn't selling, at least not the dispassionate tripe Johnny was trying to sell. It was once rumored that Phillips told Cash to ""go home and sin; then come back with a song I can sell"" (lol), although in a 2002 interview Johnny denied that he made any kind of statement.

Another problem is the generally negative portrayal of Vivian who, by all accounts, was a good, supportive wife. The problem with their marriage wasn't Vivian, but rather Johnnys increasing addictions and infatuation with Carter.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Waylon Payne appears as Jerry Lee Lewis, Tyler Hilton as Elvis and Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings.

The film runs 136 minutes (extended cut 153 minutes) and was shot in Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas and California.

1603403,4,B00005JO1R,"It's a familiar story -- young kid with talent finds early success, can't handle it (all that touring and pressure), slips into drinking and drugging, causes pain to those who care about him, and finally is saved by the love of a good woman.  There's a bit more to it, in that, in the case of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), we're invited to think that there's a connection between his loss, as a child, of a beloved older brother, his father's obvious favoring of the dead boy, and Johnny's later disintegration -- although it has to be said that as a performer, Johnny isn't presented as lacking confidence.  But he has married early and in haste, and then he has fallen in love with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), also married, with whom his band does a lot of touring.  June, however, turns out to be the good woman who helps him find himself again . . .

All this would be pleasant enough, despite the familiarity of the set-up, but what makes it just a bit better than that is the fact that Phoenix and Witherspoon are astoundingly good as performers of Cash's repertoire.  The scenes from their concerts are just superb, and both actors here reveal talents that I never knew they had.  Phoenix has the right look for Cash, bulky and saturnine, but his singing voice has some resemblance too -- maybe not quite as dark at the bass end, but he sings as if he absolutely believes in the songs, and his duets with Witherspoon, who plays Carter in concert as at times a provider of comic relief, are very, very good.  ""Time's a'wastin'"" and their account of Dylan's ""It ain't me, babe"" are worth the price of the DVD.  The director, James Mangold, has very deftly chosen the concert items to tie in with the ups and downs of the developing relationship between Cash and Carter, with the effect that the plot and the music work together well to heighten the stakes as the story moves forward.

Only later, after watching the movie did I wonder about June Carter.  One might argue that we don't see enough of HER damage here.  After all, she is married and divorced twice in the course of the movie (Cash only once), but we never see either husband, and her mother and family, who had her on the stage at 10, are, when we see them, models of sane common-sense when compared to Cash's family.  It's hard not to feel that things are being too grossly oversimplified there.  Still, that's no criticism of Witherspoon, given what she had to work with, and I come back to the point that the singing is sensational.",1481414400,,2510,4.514348785871965

1603804,3,B00005JO1R,"Though I like this film, I'd like to point out that it's basically like watching a fairy tale because so much of the info in the film is misconstrued or just plain lied about.
Vivian, Johnny's first wife, was painted in a very negative light. In reality, they did only date for a month before he went overseas for the military, but they wrote letters every single day and kept in close contact that way for years before they got married. They knew each other before they married.
Also, Vivian was very supportive of his music career. She just wasn't supportive of his drug habit.

Oh, and by the way, June Carter was a cutthroat homewrecker. And she was on drugs off and on as well. During her and Johnny's marriage, they both cheated on each other. In fact, Johnny impregnated June's sister Anita while having an affair with her. Their affair lasted before and after Johnny and June's marriage.
So, this movie is great, but it's not in any way reflective of what really happened.

I don't think that Johnny Cash or June Carter Cash would have approved this in their movie. They both passed away before the movie was finished. James Mangold wants people to go see movies about individuals so that more would like this would be made. I would not go see a movie that has a character take the Lord's name in vain.

1604557,2,B00005JO1R,"This was a solid biopic, and probably as good as any out there, but I am just getting tired of biopics in general. The premise is all too familiar and just doesn't jump off the screen at you. I am starting to think that biopics in general just don't make for good screen material. They are too predictable and lack the energy of fiction.

I'll describe for you every biopic film ever: A young boy is born into really hard circumstances. The family is dirt poor and the father is an abusive alcoholic, but the film reveals a moment that proves that the kid is a genius (in math, playing the piano etc). At almost the same time count in every movie, we jump to seeing him as a teenager (being played by the famous actor who will play him for the rest of the movie). Enter the awkward first encounter with the girl that he will love for the rest of his life. She is usually seen with another guy at first. He makes a strange advance for her, and her impression of him is: ""Well, he's a little odd, but I kind of like him."" You get the feeling that she is the only one who can handle his quirkiness, and therefore they are a perfect match. She says ""No"" at first, but with persistence, her underlying feelings of love for him are revealed, and she says ""Yes.""  After the two get married/start dating, the guy dives into his talent that was revealed earlier, promising that it will pay the bills. At first, everyone laughs at him, and he just doesn't get the success he craves. Then his big break comes as his wife is pregnant, and he comes back to the house waving some piece of paper that says he's successful, and tells his wife. There is screaming and shouts of rejoice. They move into a bigger house, but the drinking/drugs/problems set in. He hits the high water mark of his career, but then his drinking/drugs/problems spin out of control, and derail his career. He starts seeing another woman as everyone starts to look scraggly, and we enter the late 1960s. The star then hits rock bottom and almost dies, and he's hospitalized. He has his moment of truth, cleans up, makes a comeback and has one last success in his career, and the music/science/math community takes him back, and his respect is restored. People who admired him all along come up to him, and validate what a positive influence he has been. Cue the last scene where his kids are all grown up, and they're having a barbecue, perhaps there are grandchildren playing, and the star makes amends with his abusive father.

Did I just describe ""Walk the Line,"" ""A Beautiful Mind,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Shine,"" or ""Ray?"" Well, tweak the formula ever so slightly, and it's any one of them. For this reason, I'm not sure that a biopic could ever jump off the screen at me. The freedom of fiction gives a movie a nice unpredictability, whereas I guess real life treats all of us rather similarly. I can't say that the star really should have flown to Mars in order to make this biopic more spicy, if that is not what really happened. However, this sort of leaves all biopics stuck in a rut. It just seems a little boring to know at the four minute mark what is going to happen at the two hour mark. To give credit where credit is due, Joaquin Phoenix does a perfectly good job, but he is limited by the fact that he needs to do a spot on impression of Johnny Cash, and real life characters are never all that explosive in their mannerisms etc. The same could be said for Reese Witherspoon, and she does a great job. Anyways, this movie is really good in the pantheon of biopics, but like I said, I am starting to give up on biopics. I give it 1.5 or 2 stars.",1436659200,3,3613,4.365527488855869

All in all, I feel like this film is in the same vain as the Ray Charles BioPic. It holds a great man to his worst...and not only him...

Within that first scene with his Dad and the N-word, I knew this was going to be a Hollywood indictment of The South...again...in so many ways...it's say really, because Cash is a heroic man - deserving of so much more than this. The fact that his son was exec-producer sort of makes me ill.

It's not that some of the dark stuff isn't important but this film makes the whole thing about that...and yes...he does come off sort of ""slow""...which he most certainly was not.

The fact that it was popular is nice. But as a biopic that explains that greatness that was Cash...it does NOT walk the line.",1432944000,3,819,4.298701298701299

1604763,5,B00005JO1R,"Walk the Line is a biographical musical drama that is based on the early life and career of country music artist Johnny Cash. The story focuses on his early life,his first family with Vivian Cash,his romance with June Carter and his rise to stardom as a country singer. It was based on numerous autobiographies. It features Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the leading roles as Johnny Cash and June Carter respectively. James Mangold co-wrote the screenplay and directed the film.

The story includes Johnny Cash's childhood wherein he experienced his battering from his abusive father and tragedy after his brother's accidental death. Then we also witness his troubled first marriage with his first wife due to his financial and emotional instability. As a country singer,we get to see his ascent into stardom in the music scene. As his fame grew,he struggled with amphetamines,barbiturates and alcoholism. But upon meeting June Carter,it helped him overcome those struggles and her support provided him more success later in his career.

This was definitely a great film due to the performances of both Phoenix and Witherspoon as they give us first rate work. Although the screenplay may be a boring and slow at times,we are definitely treated to an acting extravaganza. Both performers were able to capture what Johnny Cash and June Carter are all about and their devotion to each other definitely provided lots of intrigue to the movie in spite of their supposed personal weaknesses and life struggles. Also worth mentioning is the music played in the story as it allows us to hear the popular songs and remind us of the performances of both country music legends. These are two reasons why Walk The Line deserves the highest rating.",1428710400,,1745,5.055555555555555

1604825,4,B00005JO1R,"Even though I'm not really a country music fan and have only ever listened to Johnny Cash in passing, WALK THE LINE is still one of the best musical biopics I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have great chemistry onscreen that helps to sell the lifelong friendship and later, romance, that developed between Johnny and June Carter Cash. They also chose a good period of Cash's life to focus on that helps to establish a perfect narrative arc and deliver one of the best happy endings I've ever seen. Still, the road to that happy ending isn't easy. Johnny Cash wasn't the nicest person in the world and it really wore on my patience to see him making the same mistakes over and over again. But beneath it all, there was an admirable persistence that came through despite him being so unlikeable for so much of the film. The film also features some great toe-tapping music with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon actually lending their voices to the timeless tunes. And again, it's partially this element which makes their portrayal of these people so good. The only issue I took with the film is that it was a little too long. After several times of Johnny Cash messing up with drugs and alcohol I got the point, so some of the later sequences bordered on overkill. Going into the film you already know how it will turn out and forgive me if I want to get to the happy ending a little quicker. There were also some genre cliches that are a little bit more noticeable now that a lot of these types of films (and parodies of those films) exist. But despite all of that, I can forgive these ""sins"" for the music and crowd-pleasing resolution to the story. Overall, WALK THE LINE is able to mostly transcend its cliches through its earnest and heartfelt execution. If you're a fan of good music and good films, you should enjoy this.",1427328000,,1846,4.563253012048193

1605217,4,B00005JO1R,"Ever since Johnny (Ka-Ching) Ca$h was a young boy he dreamed of becoming a gospel or country singer. With his first wife, Vivian, and his infant daughter, he tried to support them as a door-to-door salesman. Although he was earnest, it was not his forte. Two propitious events would change his destiny. First, having the legendary Sam Phillips take a chance on him by coaching or directing him in his first studio recording session. Sam is the Memphis music producer that brought fame to Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. Second, having winsome June Carter, who could regale audiences, as his duet partner on tours. From their first encounter, Johnny and June were instantly attracted to each other. She, an established recording artist, would do opening comedic acts and then sing along side Johnny. However, as their working relationship grew more than a professional one, June sensed resentment from Johnny's wife, Vivian. June was devoutly religious and moralistic. She had serious qualms about coming between the two of them in their marriage and it weighed heavily on her. The idea was unfathomable to her; so, she was impelled to terminated their partnership. After going their separate ways, June would get married to a stock car driver. It would not work out, and they would divorce. Likewise, Johnny and Vivian would have difficulties. Vivian appeared to have married for materialistic reasons, not for love, but for what Johnny could provide for her. In a paroxysm, she revealed this cupidity in a heated exchange when she cried out, ""I want everything you promised me."" When he could not deliver on his promises, or meet her expectations, there was conjugal strife (marital discord). Some time later, a chance meeting between Johnny and June would kindle old feelings. Johnny implores her to rejoin his band. Once again she would have to revisit the agony of either listening to her conscience or following her heart. This time, they would choose to pursue their happiness with abandon, they would get married, and they would immensely enjoy each others company for the rest of their lives.",1417046400,,2095,5.022988505747127

1605260,5,B00005JO1R,"Walk the Line is on its surface a love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter.  But beneath its surface a deeper subject matter lies; grief and guilt over an untimely death.  You have to wonder how many families pass around guilt when one of their own tragically dies young.  Everyone must be swimming in pain not wanting to accept they may have in one way or another contributed to the unexpected devastation and therefore lay the burden on someone else in the family instead of asking what they themselves might have done differently to prevent the tragedy in the first place.  Interestingly theres a film by Rian Johnson called Brick which does the opposite.  The lead character Brendan says on the subject of avenging his girlfriends death, I set out to know who put her in the spot, who put her in front of the gun.  In other words he is not after the person who pulled the trigger and put the bullet into his girlfriend, but rather the person who put her in danger of getting shot in the first place.

Walk the Line introduces its bookended grief in the form of an electric table saw.  As the movie begins we see Johnny Cash leaning over and intensely observing the round ominous blade of one backstage as he prepares to perform his legendary Folsom Prison concert.  At first we do not know why the blade is so important but as the movie continues we see how it played an extraordinary part in shaping the singer/songwriters life and we come back to the saw towards the end of the film right before he goes on stage.

Johnny Cash, we find out, grew up on a farm with his mother, sisters, father and his older brother Jack.  Jack was the fathers favorite because he was easier for the father to understandor rather because Jack was better at assimilating into what their father wanted.  On one fateful day Jack and Johnny set out to go fishing but Jack, needing to earn money for the struggling family, stops at a place who hires him to slice boards with a table saw first.  The scene is great at showing the precariousness of the saw with Johnny shutting it off at one point when Jack loses control of the wood.  Jack tells Johnny to head out fishing without him and hell catch upbut Jack never does.  Instead their father pulls up along the road Johnny is walking on and says, Where were you? and the next scene shows the mangled and blood drenched Jack lying on his death bed with his family gathered round.  Johnny yells out Do something! but no one can and Jack dies.

Johnny then spends much of the rest of his childhood being hated by his father.  His father even saying at one point the devil took the wrong son.  In order to find solace Johnny escapes into his music which his mother introduces him to but no one really supports him in.  He goes off and joins the military and finding himself lonely calls up a girl he used to date and proposes to her.  And much like his family she doesnt understand him either.

Finally one day a few years later after his first daughter Roseanne is born and hes stuck in a job as a door to door salesman, Johnny happens upon a recording studio where he sees he could make a record.  He gathers his two friends together as his band and they practice and audition much to the disappointment of his wife who wants him to get a job from her father and make some money.  At first the bands audition goes poorly.  But when Johnny starts singing a song he wrote while he was in the military called Folsom Prison Blues everything changes, they get a record deal and Johnnys story begins.

The theme of guilt and grief continues to run through the film when we see even after he has become successful Johnny succumbs to letting his father say grace at the table during the holidays as a way to appease the man for the death of Jack.  His family also dislikes June and their unrequited romance which becomes stronger and stronger the more they perform together until finally one Thanksgiving Johnny says to his father, Where were you?  In reference to Jacks death, pointing out how his father, who was a notorious drinker wasn't around to save Jack either and the anger between father and son explodes.

It is also interesting to point out that in a scene when he is discussing doing an acoustical concert at Folsom Prison after reading fan mail from inmates there one of the men says to him of his all black attire, You look like you're going to a funeral. To which Johnny Cash replies, Maybe I am.  It is yet another reference to the constant shadow of his dead brother.

Its a shame the film didn't include the deleted scenes in it because there really isn't a bad one in the bunch or one that couldn't have been in the film.  In my opinion a film is either good or it isnt.  And a good one should tell its story in its entirety no matter how long or how short it may be.  The deleted scenes have great moments which further show the pressure of Johnnys guilt over Jacks death and the way his brother haunts him such as when he stops at a bar after walking home from Junes house and find out the bar tenders name is Jack.  Another deleted scene shows a fabric flower which Johnny unintentionally tore off of Junes dress at their first concert together sits on his desk as he tries to write I Still Miss Someone about the absence of Jack from his life.

Even without these additional scenes Walk The Line is a terrific, well-structured film with wide audience appeal and the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and the deservedly Oscar winning Reese Witherspoon as June Carter who are both nothing less than phenomenal, especially when you consider not only their outstanding singing numbers together but the inner turmoil that must have eaten at Joaquin as he made the film considering he too tragically lost his brother River to a drug overdose on Halloween of 1993.",1416787200,7,5809,4.457466918714556

1605425,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" is a great piece of work that covers an impressive amount of Johnny Cash's history.

The movie starts with Mr. Cash getting ready to do his famous live record at Folsom Prison. When he sees a buzz saw, he goes into a series of flashbacks. (These flashbacks are of course the majority of the film.)

The flashbacks go back to his childhood where he had to deal with not only with the tragic death of his brother, but his troubles with his father as well. We then go to his marriage with Vivian. We also have a comical look at JC's time as an unsuccessful door to door salesman. On the verge of financial desperation he is able to record his 1st record. (Can't exactly call it a CD here.)

For a moment, all seems well, and his rocky marriage with Vivian starts to get better. But of course once he starts performing, it isn't long before June Carter comes into the picture. In my opinion, the marriage with Vivian may have survived. But the problem was she didn't have any affection for the music that was so important to Johnny. And we all know that June cared about the music. (She even came from a family that performed.) We all know what happened, but the breaking of Johnny and Vivian is VERY WELL delayed when we see small appearances from many famous contemporaries. (Elvis, Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis.) On a side note, the guy who did Jerry Lee REALLY deserves kudos for taking a small part, playing it to the hilt, and making a huge impression with it.

Johnny develops not only an obsession with June, but a drug problem. June of course is against it, but she's not totally spotless. She does sleep with Johnny even though she knows that he has a wife and children.

Johnny's fixation on June eventually makes it impossible for Vivian and Johnny to reconcile. And despite Vivian's uptight nature, we are allowed some sympathy for her. She seemed to grudgingly tolerate his thing for June, but hanging up pictures of her in the house was the last straw. The arguably saddest scene in the film is when Johnny and Vivian have their final fight. Vivian can only cry, and then the children fall into tears when they see the final fight.

After losing his family, and having somewhat of a breakdown, Johnny goes through a long and painful recovery. (With the help of not only June, but her parents as well.)

Johnny (recovered now and perhaps moved by his past troubles) decides to perform a great act of compassion and record the famous Live Folsom Prison record. And now we are back to the present.

And of course, all that remains now is for June to say 'yes.'

The movie is a bit long, but it's never boring. And it alternates well between the slow scenes and the quickly paced scenes. And of course, there is an impressive amount of Johnny's songs in it.

The movie leaves me very little to complain about. In fact, only one thing. Maybe it isn't crucial, but it would have been interesting to show when Mr. Cash tried to kill himself. He wandered into a cave hoping to get lost and die. But he was guided out by light and mist, and he was convinced that Jesus stopped him from killing himself. From that moment, he became a very devout Christian. But of course, you can't put everything in one movie.

Overall, it's a GREAT film that alternates well between slow scenes, quickly paced scenes, dialogue, music, comedy, and sadness. And that's arguably what makes it such a great film. At times we think we're watching a comedy, and at other times we think we're watching a tragedy.

Finally, what makes it so great is that while Pheonix and Witherspoon play these historical (and recently deceased) characters with tremendous energy,  we get a great cast of minor characters who were Mr. Cash's contemporaries.

THEATRICAL VS DIRETOR'S CUT: The Director's Cut has about 20 extra minutes. In my opinion, the theatrical version flows better. When I watched the longer version, I honestly could understand why a lot of these scenes were removed from the theatrical version. Especially, the early 'Cry, Cry, Cry' scene. It was a little early for Vivian to say: ""You hate me."" It really started the crumbling of the marriage between Vivian and John too early.

Slight difference. In the theatrical version, when Vivian and the children leave, Johnny screams: ""Vivian, you're leaving all this?!"" In the Director Cut he screams: ""Vivian, leave them out of this!"" I prefer the theatrical version in that it underlines that he sees Vivian leaving as a loss.

Although, of the many deleted scenes, there are 3 of them that I wish they had left.  (1) The scene where John is trying to write a song, and he has a hallucination of Jack, (2)The scene where after he had a fight with June, he went to a bar and couldn't stand to hear himself and June singing 'Jackson' on the radio, and (3) the longer scene with Waylon Jennings. The WJ scene is in the theatrical version, but it plays longer in the DC. Played longer, Waylon points out that Johnny was 'out' for 30 hours. So we can see that the drugs are starting to make Johnny less aware of time.

Generally speaking, the theatrical version flows better, and it smartly moves gradually to the crumbling of the marriage between Vivian and Johnny. But the Director Cut (as drawn out as it might feel) includes interesting footage that Johnny is still suffering from the loss of Jack and that he is starting to lose awareness of time. You kind of have to make your own choice here. I like those 3 scenes, but I would have left most of the other deleted scenes out.",1406592000,,5547,4.563380281690141

Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job of playing a man trapped in the hustle and bustle of being a famous singer, while trying to earn/keep the relationship with the woman he loves.  I didn't grow up with Johnny Cash, so I don't know his exact life story, but I do know that I love his music and enjoy this movie enough to give it five stars and watch it over and over again since it came out.",1404259200,,597,4.120689655172414

1605484,5,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are TERRIFIC in this biopic about Johnny Cash.  Great acting, never boring, Can be gut wrenching.  Phoenix depicts a man with a tortured past and a father who withholds his approval forever.  As a consequence Cash is seen as a person who always feels aggrieved and is infinitely needy.  Withersppon's June Carter is also neurotic but she manages to bring the warmth and caring that Cash craves.",1404172800,,432,4.958333333333333

1605520,4,B00005JO1R,"This was an enjoyable and engaging movie from start to finish. I loved the music most of all and thought that Joaquin and Reese did a more than adequate job with the vocals. Considering the mega-star status of June and Johnny Cash, those were tall boots to fill! ;-)

I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars for a couple of reasons. I agree with some of the other reviewers here in regards to how the movie seemed to dwell on Johnny Cash's addictions. Also the portrayal of his first wife as a first class BAG!!! (another B comes to mind actually). June Carter on the other hand is portrayed as a ""goodie two shoes"" throughout who can do no wrong, in spite of her hypocritical behavior of being twice divorced and committing adultery, but also supposedly being deeply religious.

Given that they were portraying real people who still have many living family members, I think this could have been handled in a more sensitive and thoughtful way. I'm sure there's some back story on the obvious slant of this film, on both those points.

I'm glad I watched the movie and also bought the soundtrack CD because of it, but as far as being ""all true"" the jury is certainly still out on that one.",1402704000,2,1180,4.47906976744186

1605522,5,B00005JO1R,"I love this movie. I like the actors and actresses. The movie summarizes the starting of Johnny and June Cash's relationship. It also shows events that happened in Johnny's life like the incident with his brother. I do think John Carter Cash produced the movie. Overall, it's a really good movie.",1402617600,,296,4.823529411764706
1605523,5,B00005JO1R,"There are movies that want to tell a story and there are movies that want to transcend simple storytelling to become an emotional, and sometimes spiritual experience. Walk the Line is the former, but it's amazing at what it does. It realistically and efficiently portrays the early life of The Man In Black, focusing on his relationship with June Carter before their marriage in 1968. It's a pretty standard story in rock star biopic terms (drug abuse, multiple marriages, infidelities), but Walk the Line rises above many of it's overcooked brethren in its simplicity, beautiful direction, and outstanding performances. James Mangold shot the film with the clarity most rock star biopics are missing and it's this quality that makes Walk the Line something special. As opposed to films like Oliver Stone's The Doors, which is both hazy and mystical, James Mangold's effort, with the help of DP Phedon Papamichael, wipes away the celebrity veneer with concise and intimate visuals. Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash is astounding. Never does a moment pass when the audience question's Phoenix's portrayal and he goes above and beyond to convince the viewers that he and Cash are one. His voice, his mannerisms, his looks, are pure Cash. Reese Witherspoon more than keeps up with her powerful co-star. She is a sympathetic beauty, much like June Carter, and she has the voice to boot. To undersell it, the chemistry between the two stars is totally engrossing. And of course, because it's a film about Johnny Cash, the music is lovely. In short, Walk the Line is an interesting story brought to life through a very talented cast and crew. There aren't many bold or artistic touches to speak of, but there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that.",1402358400,3,1744,4.9965635738831615

1605528,5,B00005JO1R,"I have always loved Johny's music, but It was sadly lost on youth today. This movie is more about the love Johny and June had for each other and all of the trials and tribulations they went through together...and how they had their marriage thrive for 35 years. Not many people can say that. This is just a beautiful example of what TRUE LOVE really is..",1400803200,,354,4.378787878787879
1605529,5,B00005JO1R,"Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter Cash and Joaquin Phoenix plays the man in black.

Movies about the life of a person have to be boiled down into a few hours. It is not an easy task.

I thought the movie did a reasonable job of portraying the early part of his life, up to where he married June. That was pretty much where it stopped though.

I also think Reese Witherspoon did a better job of portraying June Carter than Phoenix did of portraying Cash, although I think he did an adequate job. Throughout the movie I believed in her character and the accolades she got for her role were well deserved.

The music is good and pretty well done.

Also, the story was more about showing his drug use and whitewashing the ongoing affair between the married Cash and June Carter. It sounds like their son trying to rewrite history to make them look better, when the rest of us just wanted the music. The movie itself, if not strictly true, was fun, but I love Cash's music and I was disappointed.

The reason for my reduced rating, is actually because of Cash's life itself. Johnny made a lot of poor choices.  I knew that before I saw the movie, but I didn't understand the extent of those choices.  Unfortunately knowing the details about those choices makes the man less likable.  For this reason, you may want to think twice before watching the movie.  Don't get me wrong, his songs, talent, and his passion are still significant.

1605919,5,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do an excellent job of portraying Johnny and June Carter Cash. Their acting makes the characters come to life. For someone who was only vaguely familiar with the life of Johnny Cash, though I had heard many of his songs, ""Walk the Line"" gave me an insight into the life of this complex man. From his youth on through his adult life, one almost destroyed by addiction, we find a person who, like many of us, has to fight his demons, but must do so while in the public spotlight. And, like the rest of us, he fails time and again. However, thanks to his second wife, June Carter, who never stops believing in him, and his own willingness to persevere, he triumphs in the end.

""Walk the Line"" does not idolize Johnny Cash but rather casts him in an honest light, one that clearly shows both the good attributes and the character flaws of this man.

If I were to offer any criticism it is that occasionally (but only occasionally) the movie drags. Some of the more repetitive scenes could have been shortened or excised entirely without doing damage to the movie as a whole. However, this does not detract from the value of the movie as well as the redemptive message it sends, and therefore the movie is clearly worth five stars.",1380844800,,1265,4.5196506550218345

1605996,4,B00005JO1R,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and imagine it will eventually be regarded as a classic, if it isn't already. But as a portrait of Johnny Cash it suffers from a serious flaw: the role of Jesus Christ in his life. I'm not a Christian, but Cash was, and while June Carter undoubtedly played a huge role in his life, to neglect the role of Cash's faith is to distort the picture badly. Read the account of how Cash kicked drugs, and you will see how different it was from what we see in the film. June was an important figure in the true story, but she played an auxiliary role; it was Cash's faith that was of primary importance. That is totally missing in this otherwise excellent film.",1376611200,,684,4.3515625

1606143,4,B00005JO1R,"Johnny Cash was one of those awesome, almost legendary figures that needs no introduction. He was Johnny Cash, the Man in Black. Nuff said.

And you would think that no actor could adequately capture his mystique, but the ever-brilliant Joaquin Phoenix came pretty close in ""Walk The Line."" The story of the first half of Cash's life runs through a lot of the typical tropes -- drugs, sex, hitting rock bottom, finding love -- but Phoenix's eerily perfect performance elevates it. And yes, he sings.

The story begins in Cash's boyhood, which was marked by A) the open contempt of his alcoholic father, B) the shocking death of his brother, and C) his love of music. When he was grown, Cash (Phoenix) joined the Air Force and married his reluctant girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).

But his love of music never died. Despite Vivian wanting him to get a ""real job,"" Cash successfully impressed a record executive with his gravelly voice and gritty songs -- and became a megastar with his very first album. While on tour, he encountered June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and was immediately smitten by her both professionally and personally.

But his growing love for June quickly destroyed his marriage, and his increasing drug use seemed to be doing the same to his career -- even landing him in jail at one point. June stepped in to save him from his downward spiral, inspiring him to clean up his life and go back on the road -- even to Folsom Prison, where he had a lot of fans. But his true goal was her hand in marriage.

""Walk the Line"" has a rather rough task -- tell the life story of one of America's most beloved singers, warts and all, without diminishing any of what made him great. So yeah, there's adultery and drug use here, but it never blots out the wounded, romantic soul that walks the line in the center of it, tangled in barbed-wire issues.

And the triumph of the film is Joaquin Phoenix, who gives a scarily perfect performance as Cash. His body language, his expressions, even his VOICE are all altered to be as close as possible to Cash's -- and yes, Phoenix sings Cash's songs. But what makes his performance great is not mere mimicry of Cash -- it's his ability to give a pitch-perfect imitation of Cash while also giving a powerful, heartfelt performance as an artistic soul covered in scars, who had to fight his way past everyone who doubted him.

James Mangold focuses a lot on the shaping influences of Cash's life here, setting up his brother's horrific, bloody death as the place where his life changed. But when June enters the story, it becomes less about Cash by himself, and more about the love story between them -- lots of significant glances on brightly-lit stages, lots of impassioned pleas on tour buses.

Sadly, Reese Witherspoon can't stand up to Phoenix's spellbinding performance. She isn't bad, but her ""perky li'l Southern belle"" performance just feels immature and shallow when she's standing next to him. It's hard to see what depths Cash saw in this woman.

""Walk the Like"" is a movie entirely revolving around the breathtaking performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who practically BECOMES Johnny Cash as few other actors ever could. Witherspoon just can't stand up to it.",1366243200,,3221,4.747763864042934
1606144,5,B00005JO1R,The acting is superb and the screen writing is well crafted. The movie and it's story are a credit to all involved. Great testament to the memory of Mr. Cash.,1366156800,,158,4.3

1606146,5,B00005JO1R,"I wasn't raised with country music because I am of Spanish origin, but because of my personal musical diversity I bought this movie that did very well for Joaquin and Reese.

What a great movie!! and this sentence is an understatement. One thing I just know as a professional musician even though I am clean and always took the art form very seriously, is that in music, no matter what musical style you play, there is always drugs knocking down our door.

Drugs killed Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Parker, Whitney Houston and many other great musical legends. Fortunately for Johnny Cash with the angelic help of June Carter he got over it.

To anyone that reads this so they can understand musicians a bit more because musicians are very unique beings - very sensitive as we transform our feelings into MUSIC. Unfortunately, the music business is very hostile and cruel. Sometimes the demons from our childhood hunts us down and lead to our own self destruction like happened to Johnny Cash because of his father.

It is a common saying in MUSIC that the roads of excess lead to the Palace Of Wisdom. I don't know about that. One thing all music styles have in common is the drugs are always there whether you want to or not. If you are strong enough you can still be successful no matter what and discard them.

I'm very thankful to Hollywood and John Cash Jr for bringing us the story of his father just like Clint Eastwood filmed BIRD so many years ago here for posterity.

There are so many music stories like this one yet to be filmed that should be told for future generations.

Johnny Cash was a door to door salesman and thanks to Sam Phillips form SUN RECORDS got a record deal and then he moved up the ladder and became thanks to his talent over time - JOHNNY CASH.

One thing I noticed that happened to Johnny Cash, just like Richard Nixon, is that the demons from his childhood chased him through his career and in Richard Nixon's case to the White House.

This is a wonderful film by one of the greatest musicians of our time and it made me a Johnny Cash fan. I have to buy the cd LIVE AT FOLSOM PRISON that is one of the most important recordings of our time.

Last but not least, thank you JOAQUIN PHOENIX and REESE WHITHERSPOON. They possibly did the best performance of their respective careers in this movie.

Joaquin Phoenix did and excellent job in this film, in his portrayal of the Man in Black.  I was very surprised that he did not win the Oscar, although he was nominated.  This movie has excellent performance of Phoenix and of Witherspoon, who portrays his life-long love, June Carter.  Excellent performances of both actors.  A very good, entertaining, poignant film.

1606191,5,B00005JO1R,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I recently saw the movie for the first time, after watching a ""Biography"" show featuring Joaquin Phoenix. According to ""Biography"", Johnny Cash really and truly admired Phoenix after seeing him in ""Gladiator"" and hand picked him for this film. It is acted superbly (and sung) by both Phoenix and Witherspoon.  It details the early life of Johnny Cash and his wife.

Cash  had quite a few demons that he overcame.  I've always enjoyed his music, but this movie shows him as so very""human"", vunerable, even tortured...and a very likeable flawed human being.

Witherspoon captured the strength of June Carter Cash.  Part of this movie details the breakup of Cash's first marriage. It was painful for his first wife to  realize he was in love with June Carter, but there just wasn't any  doubt; June was his soul mate and a source of strength for him, and they were very good for each other.  It felt like those 2 souls belonged together. I believe they were married for 35 years and he died 4 months after June.  I hope they are still together in death.",1362009600,,1080,4.661375661375661

1606195,4,B00005JO1R,"This movie is a fine, if narrowly scoped, drama focusing on the life of Johnny Cash as acted by a searching and posing Joaquin Phoenix (one of the two primary reasons to see this movie; the other being that you have an interest in the life of Cash).  Reese Witherspoon as June Carter does a nice turn in the acting department too but she is required to be subtle and, while not played as completely in Cash's shadow, largely is in his shadow for the crux of the movie.  I found the drama to be earthy and not transcendent (I suppose I expected a bit more of the transcendence) but that is probably because it doesn't take you up close to the end of Cash's life.  It really focuses on Cash growing up and starting out and the tumultuous relationship that he initially shared with June Carter.  But mark me Joaquin is on the screen for almost the entire movie and that is why you'll be drawn in and glued to the screen.",1360108800,,917,4.283236994219653

Immense artistic talent mixed with shyness and a desire to make up for past faults, all within the context of the rise of rock and roll, makes Cash's a story like no other, except for perhaps that of  Elvis.

It's a remarkable love story about flawed but totally likable individuals. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation in this film. He IS the man in black and he's so raw and vulnerable that it's as if Johnny Cash was reborn in him. Why he didn't get an Oscar for this performance is beyond me.

1606363,3,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix takes on the early life and times of Johnny Cash, with something more than an assist from Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It's great material, more factual than many dramaticized biopics, but seems like it's always standing just a hair away from fully embracing the man and his mythos. Phoenix emphatically pours himself into the role, but can't quite nail the man's authoritative, larger-than-life presence either on the stage or off it. That, along with his ever-so-slightly imperfect take on Cash's legendary singing voice, had me seeing the Oscar nominee as a tremendous impersonator but not a living, breathing character unto himself. Surprisingly, Witherspoon fares much better in a role that seemed on the surface to be terribly miscast. She's sweet, streetsmart and talented, and much of the trauma we endure from Cash's self-inflicted trouble is drawn from the toll it takes on her. An ambitious picture that has its heart in the right place, but can't fully recover from a few crucial, disappointing near-misses.",1346803200,,1040,5.233532934131737

They were truly meant for one other.  This dvd was much to my liking.",1346025600,,400,4.32
1606416,5,B00005JO1R,"I found ""Walk the Line"" in the bargain bins at a nearby Wal-Mart. I snatched it up in an instant. ""Walk the Line"" was an acclaimed movie, the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I particularly remembered Johnny Cash from his rise in the earliest days of what later became Rock 'n' Roll. He, along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and several others were the star recording artists on the legendary Sun Records roster under the direction of Sam Phillips. This DVD will automatically become an important part of my music collection.

It's an excellent movie! I can't emphasize this enough. Joaquin Phoenix and  Reese Witherspoon were outstanding in their depictions of Johnny and June, and they did their own singing! The music was quite good, perhaps not quite up to the original masters, but it was close. All of the other musical performers were outstanding. The movie was a period piece, of course, and the depiction of the 50s and 60s was very well done. I particularly liked the 50s. Everything looked absolutely authentic. The streets were lined with magnificently restored 50s and earlier cars, some of which I haven't seen for decades. Where did they get them all?

The story was captivating. It recorded Johnny Cash's spectacular rise from being a failing door-to-door salesman, to a recording artist and up to a super-star in a very short period of time. Naturally, there's booze, drugs and women, not necessarily in that order, and there's the fall. It's a common story for rock 'n' rollers, but it's exceptionally well done here. And the story really got a good grip on the heart. This movie was magnificently entertaining, and if you liked the music, it's just heavenly. Five Stars!

Wow.

It's a long movie but I hardly noticed. Some really truly great acting from both leads - a magnificent supporting cast. A compelling, dramatic, and moving story of redemption.

Of necessity the film focuses on a relatively short period of Cash and Carter's life and the genesis of their relationship, but it whets the appetite to find out more about the man and his music. I think it actually works a good deal better than if they had tried to fit his whole life in - it's a snapshot, which has enabled the filmmakers to really get into the story, not skim over things too much.

Witherspoon and Phoenix both put in quite amazing vocal performances. Phoenix in particular beautifully portrays Johnny's journey from wannabe gospel singer nervously trying out his own song for a producer right up to the confident rock star with the inmates of Folsom putty in his hands. Acting, singing and playing wise both actors give it their all, and the supporting actors who learned to sing and singers who learned to act all come out smelling of roses.

Some beautiful and some incredibly powerful scenes - those where June and her family walk Cash through withdrawal from drugs fitting neatly into both those categories and being some of my favourite parts of the film.

One also mustn't forget the two young actors playing young JR and his brother, who really set up the film incredibly well - the opening scenes leading up to the death of his brother show that these two young actors are serious talent of the future and they do a beautiful job making real the close friendship that haunts the adult Cash throughout the rest of the film.

I could seriously waffle on for ages, I have been so impressed by this movie. What can I say? It's a triumph. Do watch the deleted scenes and also the interesting and informative commentary (which gives the background to some scenes in the movie which in many cases you may otherwise think must have been elaborated on or made up). I am looking forward to getting my hands on the double disc set and seeing the rest of the extras.

Buy this movie, or at least, rent this movie, you won't regret it. It's a keeper and one I am certain I shall watch many times more.

And... a new addition to my all time favourite quotes:

1606471,5,B00005JO1R,"The way this film starts out and how it chronicles the life of one of my favorite performers is really good and turns out to be better than I had thought it would be at first.

It follows as Johnny Cash starts out and progresses to where he was in Vegas and after a show, June caught him taking his pills and then she started regretting her involvement thinking him to be addicted, as it would turn out after that night's show, he took too many and something happened and he passed out, then all of that leads to him going to Mexico and as he looks for more medication and turns out to be a dramatic trip that changes the way he relates to his own performances and his fans.

1606524,3,B00005JO1R,"Given all the honors this film got, I remain still mystified why. I am a Johnny Cash fan, a June Carter fan, a Joaquin Phoenix fan and a Reese Witherspoon adorer but, folks, if there ever was a standard-issue Hollywood biopic this is it.  Utterly predictable start to finish, gaping holes in the chronicle of a life and for me the biggest problem is that the June Carter portrayed here has so little to do with the real June Carter.  The Carter Family singers, who loomed large over all of June's life and every facet of it, are barely referred to here.  Beyond that, June began as a country comic with goofy facial expressions, goofy body poses, goofy dancing, an aw-shucks-I-don't-know-much-beyond-the-holler persona and very little hint of beauty in her face, body or the way she dressed.  The evidence is there in dozens of T.V. shows.  When Johnny Cash came into her life a Cinderella transformation occurred.  She became a beautiful, poised true artist, and that is I believe as many do because Johnny Cash was the first person in her life to see that beautiful, that poise and that artistry.  Growing up in both a famous family and poverty and with endless expectations of what a girl and woman should be, June was a deep soul, often melancholy and wistful.
Reese Witherspoon captures barely anything of the real June; we instead get an All American sweetheart.  Reality aside, the film is strictly color-by-numbers; all the Sun Records passages, all the performances represent a Hollywood summation of what happened. There's never any sense of really being there, always every sense of a movie set and movie scene. The photography and cinematography are gorgeous and the music is spot-on, though it would be hard to ruin this music.  Why Witherspoon got an Oscar I can't fathom.  Her performance is capable but a far piece down the road from an Oscar moment, though I have no doubt she could deliver many Oscar moments.  In fact, I think ""Legally Blonde"" is a more important film, even though it is a comedy and Oscar has always had a tough time rewarding comedy.
Still, this film is well-worth getting to see what went right and what went wrong and how difficult it is to put real life on film when it's not real life.",1314576000,5,2227,4.699228791773779
1606525,5,B00005JO1R,"Johnny Cash has always been a favorite of mine.  I have read two biographies of his life, and purchased this film to see if the visual is as accurate as the written biography.  I am pleased to say that this film is a reliable reproduction of the life of Johnny and June (Carter) Cash.

And what a wonderfully entertaining film this is!  I am keeping this one for my collection, and very few films make my collection - only those I want to see again (and again).  The acting performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are Oscar worthy and perhaps the best work either has ever done.  Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash, and we learn what a tortured man he was, and how June's love helped Johnny find peace and contentment.  Witherspoon becomes June Carter, down to her lovely voice and vivacious and energetic spirit.

The songs are absolutely wonderful.  While they cannot compare to the originals by Johnny and June, they hold their own quite nicely.  (If interested in heaing a really neat album of duets by Johnny and June, I recommend this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carryin-On-With-Johnny-Cash-June-Carter/dp/B0000636Y6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carryin' On With Johnny Cash & June Carter</a>

If you watch the extra's, you will see comments of love for Johnny by an odd array of artists including Kid Rock, Ozzy, Kris Kristofferson, Trent Rezner and others, proving Johnny trensended all muscial interests.  I also really like biographical movies such as The Aviator & A Beautiful mind and now I Walked the Line.  This is an outstanding movie, and like Johnny, it is very honest.  It was quite disturbing to learn of the depths of Johnny's drug, alcohol, relationship problems, and the pain of a youthful upbringing where his brother dies from an accident, and his Dad blames Johnny and emotionally tortures him throughout his life.  It is a story of a tortured individual who poured all of his life experiences into his songs.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are absolutely amazing in their respective parts as Johnny Cash and June Carter.  They sing all of the songs themselves, and did an outstanding job.  The Extended Cut 2-DVD version has a 2nd disc that covers a lot of history about the making of the movie and the history of Johnny Cash.  Yes, it would have been awesome to see actual video of the Folsom Prison taping, but still contains an amazing amount of history and information.  The video quality is excellent, not sure it could be any better on Blu-Ray.

The music is great and makes for an excellent introduction to Johnny Cash's work. This film kept me interested the whole way through, and left me wanting to find out more. This is also well worth a viewing even if you know nothing of Cash or aren't a big fan of country music, it can be watched as a human interest story in it's own right, but you will leave it captivated by the man. Simply excellent!

The film pulls no punches when it comes to his eventual drug abuse as he performed on the road and the way the pills he took eventually pulled apart his life.

1606650,4,B00005JO1R,"I am reviewing this nicely done commercial effort to delve into parts of the lives of the legendary singers Johnny Cash and his (eventual) wife June Carter Cash (of the famous mountain music Carter Family bloodlines. Her mother was the incredible vocalist and guitarist Maybelle Carter) in reverse order. Although I saw the this film for the first time when it was released in theaters (and have viewed it several times on DVD) several years ago I am reviewing now after having just seen the real Johnny Cash and June Carter on one of the segments of Pete Seeger's black and white television programs from the mid-1960s, ""Rainbow Quest"" where they appeared.  And knocked me, and I think Pete, over with their renditions of Carter Family material and information about that clan.

Okay, here is the skinny. If you want to get the glamorous, sexy romance and a fetching June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), the heartache and longing of pain in the butt Johnny Cash and the eventual joining together of two great musical talents story then this is the place to start. But, if you want the reason why this film was made in the first place, the legendary musical talent, warts and all, then watch them go through their paces along with old Pete Seeger. Both are worth the time.",1249948800,,1268,4.733031674208145
1606651,5,B00005JO1R,"I'm anything but a Johnny Cash fan. The only time I got a kick out of his music was in the late Sixties (or early Seventies?), when he released his tongue-in-cheek hit, ""Boy Named Sue.""  Very entertaining, in case you haven't heard it.  Otherwise, I paid scant attention to the Man in Black, other than knowing he sang about trains, and crime, and prison, and that he was a tad rambunctious.

So when WALK THE LINE initially came out, my interest wasn't all that keen on learning about the troubled life of Cash (or his equally tumultuous romance with June Carter).  Two words got me to go see the film during its theatrical run--and to watch this exceptional movie several times since:  Joaquin Phoenix.  I'm a big fan of this remarkable, versatile actor, have been ever since seeing him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00009ZYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>.  And in Cash's biopic Phoenix doesn't disappoint:  he immerses himself in the character, becomes the troubled Man in Black--right down to the singer's deep baritone.  Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as the ever-aloof June Carter (ultimately June Carter Cash); Witherspoon is dead on, from June's feisty sassiness, to her twang and drawl.

It's one thing not to appreciate the actual music--it's quite another to be blown away when two actors absolutely nail the actual music.  That's what makes WALK THE LINE such a great film:  it's completely, unequivocally, believable.  Further kudos go out to Robert Patrick, who plays Cash's forever-disapproving father (the Denethor of the Ozarks).  So don't let not being a fan of Johnny Cash keep you from seeing this film; if you haven't checked out WALK THE LINE, by all means do so.  And get rhythm, when you get the blues.

1606652,4,B00005JO1R,"Watching this movie when I came out,it couldn't help but remind me, in a number of respects. to ""Ray,"" a film out a year earlier. Both were biographies of singers of a similar era, the main difference between the color of their skin, Ray being Ray Charles, of course, and this movie about Johnny Cash.

Both singers (and films):

1 - had a brother who died early on in their lives which affected them for years and years; 2 - were made to feel guilty about those deaths even though there was no reason for that guilt; 3 - had adulterous affairs as their singing careers began to take off; 4 - became addicted to drugs and beat that addiction; 5 - made bold decisions regarding their careers that went against prevailing thought but turned out to be the right decisions; 6 - movies featured outstanding music and slick photography; 7 - movies were fast-moving and interesting to view all the way through despite being over two hours long; 8 - featured wonderful acting performances.

In Walk The Line, Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Cash, goes one up on Jamie Foxx, who played Charles, because Phoenix did his own singing....and he was very good. The same applies to Reese Witherspoon as ""June Carter."" Her singing talent surprised me. It makes the film all the more believable when you know the actors are actually singing.

I am not familiar with Ginnifer Goodwin, who played Cash's first wife, but I think she gets unfairly ignored in the publicity of this film. Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Robert Patrick as Cash's father. Wasn't this the same young, trim villain in Terminator 2, which wasn't out that long ago? How can this be the same guy?!!

I think this was the better of the two films, not just because of the realism but Charles seemed almost cold, no love in him, no commitment to any woman or his own kids, while Cash has a lot of more heart to him, even if it was misplaced at times.

That seems to be the major theme of the WTL movie: the romance between Cash and Carter. Unfortunately, that's my only complaint about this film. This movie glamorizes this affair between Cash and Carter just a little too much, manipulating the audience to the point where we all want this couple to live happily ever after forgetting that Cash was married to another nice woman with two kids. Yeah, some of the ugly parts of adultery are shown but not to the degree the sweetness of this illicit romance is portrayed. The movie does not send a strong enough message that the right thing to do is for Cash to be a good father and husband in the first place and for Carter to stay away from him - period. The worst scene in the film might be Cash's two kids crying their eyes out watching their parents fight. Adultery always kills the kids more than anyone, which is one big reason I was sorry to see the Cash & Carter affair so romanticized.

I'd have liked to have seen Cash's prison ministry detailed a little more since he was so faithful in that area, and his Christian testimony in general, which was very strong his last few decades, but the film didn't deal with those last three decades. Too bad, but understandable since there is just so much you can show in two hours. The filmmakers took the tried-and-true road of a romance story instead, which makes sense business-wise.

With all the goods and bads, the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music, acting, visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people, almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life. He was an amazing man and a four-hour film about ""the rest of the story"" would have been fine with me.",1246147200,,3610,4.509174311926605

This Blu-Ray version comes from:

- TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT SOUTH PACIFIC, AUSTRALIA
- ALL REGION

It comes in a slightly wider Blu-Ray case than the US Blu-Rays but basically looks the same.  It is the same height and depth as all of your other cases, it is just about 1 1/2 times wider.  It also comes in a cardboard style slip-case.  I also have ""Almost Famous"" from the UK and that title is in the same slightly wider case.

The picture was just fantastic and as good as any Blu-Ray I have in my collection or that I have rented.  The sound was also really great.  The DTS-HD MASTER AUDIO is pristine and one of the best sounding soundtracks I have heard yet.  Plenty of clean LFE especially in the music scenes.

The video and audio included on the disc are as follows:

- English DTS-HD Master Audio
- French DTS 5.1
- German DTS 5.1
- English Commentary DD 2.0

The video is presented in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio and I don't know for sure but would assume AVC.

It is a BD-50: Dual Layer Disc

There is a second disc of special features.  I did not put this disc in because I personally don't care about most special features.  But it is a two-disc set.

Great movie (5 out of 5), (10 out of 10) or (4 stars of 4 stars).  Whichever method of rating you use, this is as close to a perfect biopic as you can get.

If you want to wait for the US BD version... go ahead.  If you love this movie and can't wait to see it in the best available format...

1606766,5,B00005JO1R,"Walk The Line is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. We get outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Look also for a strong showing by Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian. Waylon Payne also acts well as Jerry Lee Lewis. The plot moves along nicely even though there is little time spent on Johnny's childhood and his stint in the military; and the cinematography is well done.

When the film begins, we get a brief glimpse into the main themes that ran through Johnny's life when he was a very young boy growing up in the South. His father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was rather cold toward him and became even colder still when Johnny's younger brother Jack (Lucas Till) died after an accident with a chainsaw. After what seems to have been a brief period of time in the military, Johnny marries his sweetheart Vivian and tries to make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. However, Johnny's efforts in sales just didn't work out--but when he and a couple of his buddies get a chance to record a record for Sun Records things finally begin to look bright for Johnny and his young family.

Of course, complications ensue. Johnny spends time on the road--in fact, he spends a lot of time on the road and after he meets June Carter on the road his marriage to Vivian slowly but surely begins to crumble. Vivian tries hard to get Johnny to stay at home more and focus on his children; but Johnny never seems quite able to do that and after quite a few years they divorce.

Johnny pursues June Carter even though she marries another man; and he never quite gets over his poor relationship with his father. After time, Johnny's addiction to amphetamines also takes a toll on his career.

Will Johnny be able to finally convince June Carter to marry him? How does his relationship with Columbia Records go while he has all his personal problems? Just in case you're not familiar with the story of Johnny Cash, I'll leave these questions and more for you to find out as you watch this excellent flick.

I certainly think the storyline should have continued after 1968; Johnny lived and did much more with his life and career between the years 1968 and 2003 when he passed away. However, the story is quite strong and the ending titles do give you a pretty good idea of what happened to Johnny and June Carter in general.

The DVD comes with quite a few deleted scenes and there is an optional running commentary with co-writer and director James Mangold. Great!

Johnny Cash fans will love this biopic which is rather good despite a minor flaw here and there. I was very impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon performed all of their songs without any dubbing!

As you may well know, it is about Johnny Cash's (Joaquin Phoenix) struggle with drugs, fame, and his affair with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) over the course of his career. You see the performances, you see the drug action, you even get to hear Reese and Joaquin sing some songs (and they're not bad either). This special addition, however, is for those of us that want more Cash action. It is filled with extras on Johnny Cash's career, his music, the production of the film, all the things you DON'T get on the single disc version, as well as scenes that aren't in the original movie itself (this being the director's cut).

It was a moving story and so well acted.
Joaquin and Reese had amazing chemistry in every scene, but the best was watching them on stage together.  I thought they did such a good job singing rather than lip syncing.  Joaquin had his vocals down perfectly and you almost couldn't tell that it wasn't in fact Johnny Cash himself singing.  I never knew how difficult his childhood was and the lack of love from his father toward him.
You do not have to be a fan of Cash's music to really apreciate this.  Walk The Line is a great movie that I highly recommend.  It's so interesting and you can't help but tap your feet to the music.

1606844,3,B00005JO1R,"James Mangold, the director who brought us such flawed but interesting
films as Copland and Girl, Interrupted, has done it again. He has
crafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named after
one of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of Johnny
Cash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her
portrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Family
singers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merely
another way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy young
starlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia
Roberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, Charlize
Theron, and now Witherspoon. Financially, for the long term of the
industry, this makes sense, so that, even decades from now, films they
appear in can bear the Oscar imprint.

Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Cash, however, is completely out of his
league as the infamous Man In Black....Cinematographer Phedon
Papamichael adds little to the film. His framing and vistas do little
to enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poetic
element. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static and
dull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not grasp
is that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of his
singing and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focus
on the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going to
focus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up the
fascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all people
go through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer,
when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT like
the average person. In other words, as the saying goes, always print
the legend over the truth. Walk The Line never trots down that alley.",1222214400,,1901,4.922118380062305

Joaquin Phoenix really resembles ""The Man In Black""

Reese Witherspoom resembles June Carter
 the only  question that I have is :Couldn't they( the people  at
the movie  studio ) have taught them  how to  sing?

I'm tired of movies in  which the stars only lip synch to the sound track( Sweet Dreams is the best example of this fraudulant practice)
Since ,this is  a biopic  ,I'd Expect Joaquin Pheonix to at least  to play the guitar,instead of faking it!!",1218758400,,504,4.6022727272727275
1606847,5,B00005JO1R,"Here we have the rather luscious and dangerous Joaquin Phoenix channeling Johnny Cash in WALK THE LINE. At the literal heart of the movie is Cash's longstanding and long-unrequited love for June Carter (the ever ebullient Reese Witherspoon finally being allowed to put her Nashville accent to good use) and the trials and travails he must suffer before finally settling down with the love of his life. From the foot-stomping power of the very first scene, music is the thread that binds these two restless hearts and what makes the movie even more remarkable is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing!

(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at [...])",1216080000,2,694,4.982758620689655
1606848,5,B00005JO1R,"First I have to state that both Witherspoon and Phoenix really captured the essence of the two real life characters.  I was also impressed by their ability to pull off doing their own music.  The extended sequences, musical scenes, and all the featurettes really fleshed out the Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's early days.  Their story brought out by the strong acting abilities of the cast and shows how love can develop and, if you know the rest of their story, last.  Quite rare these days.  So BRAVO for this excellent film...plus the soundtrack that goes with it.",1215993600,8,571,4.7272727272727275
1606849,5,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix probably would have won the Oscar for his portrayal of Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line"" if only Jamie Foxx hadn't won the prize a year earlier for playing Ray Charles. The Oscars didn't want to look like the Grammys, so they gave the golden guy to Philip Seymour Hoffman for a less complex performance as Truman Capote.

Phoenix is better, though (and does his own singing), and director James Mangold, in a commentary, praises the actor unabashedly. One of the most memorable scenes has Cash watching from the wings as Elvis Presley (played by Tyler Hilton) wows a crowd of screaming teenagers. Without uttering a single word, Phoenix conveys a range of emotions. At first, he's admiring. Then he appears momentarily jealous of qualities Elvis has that are lacking in his own performance. Finally, he shakes off any feelings of envy he may have and is once more admiring, much too impressed with his colleague to let petty feelings intrude.

Biopics tend to follow a too predictable path, an unavoidable template when dealing with the kind of lives considered worthy of cinematic treatment. There's the early life and its troubles often depicted as providing the impetus for the subject's later success. There's the scene in which the hero discovers his talent or calling and struggles to effectively develop or present it to whomever (in this case, Sun Records' producer Sam Phillips) holds the power to bring it to the world. Then you've got the predictable rise and, sometimes, the fall. ""Walk the Line"" doesn't stray from the formula yet makes the cliches of the genre seem fresh because they allow Johnny Cash to appear not merely as a legend, an almost Mount Rushmore figure in popular music, but as a man full of doubts about his talent and his soul, and Phoenix captures him superbly.

Cash never really had a downfall comparable to Elvis Presley's, but he struggled with addiction, only overcoming his demons through the love of June Carter. He had career setbacks, but the film ends before Cash was dumped from the Columbia label and also stops short of detailing his eventual return to glory through the series of brooding recordings he made for producer Rick Rubin's American Recordings. It's a fine, superbly realized film, a testament to both the legend of its subject, and to the talents of its stars.

1606898,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" is one of those films whose success depends entirely on the performances of the actors. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are brought in to portray two icons in the world of music whose personal lives are just as fascinating as their work on stage. Fortunately, they succeed on every level, just as Russell Crowe (Phoenix's rival from 2000's ""Gladiator"") and Renee Zellweger did in the character-driven ""Cinderella Man"" earlier that year.

The music of the late Johnny Cash (Phoenix) is timeless, and so is his story. He comes from a working-class southern family, joins the Air Force and becomes a terrible salesman. His ambition was music, and he pursued it despite objections from his family and his wife. He succeeds and becomes a nationwide phenomenon, touring with the likes of Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis when they first started out. The movie covers the highs and the unbelievable lows.

The bulk of the film is set in the time period from 1954-1965. It focuses on Cash's rise to prominence and his pursuit of the love of his life, singer/entertainer June Carter (Witherspoon), even if he was already married with children. Phoenix shows Cash as a talented but troubled man, while Witherspoon delivers a duel performance, one as a sassy June Carter when she's on stage and a compassionate one everywhere else. They work together stunningly, and the rest of the cast is great as well.

The love story becomes the main focus of the film, which would be a disappointment if it wasn't for the chemistry and brilliant performances of the two. Unfortunately, the second half of Cash's life is summed up in a paragraph at the end of the movie, which doesn't do the man justice. Someone stated that it's the only musical biopic that deserves a sequel, and that person is right on the money.

Regardless, the pacing of the film and the development of the characters is excellent. Even if you've never heard of Johnny Cash before he released his cover of Nine Inch Nails' ""Hurt"" a few years back, it's really captivating. Even the performances of some of his greatest hits can appeal to anyone, from the indie rock aficionado to the death metalhead. Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing, with incredibly impressive results.

As stated before, the main focus of the film becomes the love story. It's a rather unique and alluring one, spanning many years and tons peaks and valleys. It shows both the positive and destructive aspects of love, and you watch the effect of the relationship on Cash and Carter. Too bad the end of the love story is the end of the film.

""Walk The Line"" is a great movie. The story is full of bliss and tragedy and really makes you appreciate the work of Johnny Cash. It may be a little too serious for some people, but it's still a splendid film that anyone can enjoy.",1206835200,4,2828,4.737804878048781

1606900,4,B00005JO1R,"A good film, emotionally moving and powerful. Joaquin Phoenix did a good, brooding acting job as Cash, and Reese Witherspoon was extraordinary as June Carter: strong, perky, principled, and loving, and a damned fine performer.

The symbolism (falling down, slamming doors) was a thought heavy-handed, but the film was well-made and authentic in feeling if not always in look. With some movies that cover my early days, I feel the almost physical shock of recognition of the world I knew then. I never felt that in this film, but I may be getting jaded.

Johnny Cash comes across as a man of grit, honesty, and persistence, capable of both compassion and great love, but also as a bastard with a mean streak a mile wide. He seems to have come by it naturally. Although Johnny Cash's mother was a hardworking woman with a sweet singing voice, she does not come across as a strong character. Her drunken, judgmental husband never forgave Johnny for surviving when his older, smarter brother died. Later on, she sat silent while her husband gibed at his successful son.  Johnny Cash endured a lifetime of rejection and verbal abuse from his father -- and dumped it on anyone who got in his way, including June Carter.

The film left me wondering about the stereotype of the artist as a selfish jerk. How accurate is it, generally? Does it have to be that way? What role does the nastiness and short temper play for the artist? I could see it as a smokescreen generated by a hypersensitive individual to keep people distant or just as a reaction to the intolerable stress of fame. I can also see it as arising from a sense of privilege--acting badly because they deserve better than others, or simply because their fame and money let them get away with it.

I don't fall for the idea that the Arteeeeeste is a higher life form who can be forgiven anything. But I wonder how much art has been lost because the potential artist is too damned nice to create emotional space for the work.",1205971200,,1979,4.626780626780627

1606953,2,B00005JO1R,"you're sadly mistaken and duped. Oh, why don't I like this film, it's  because what happens is a train wreck and without the energy and emotion to make it palpable.  I respect both of the actors and the director as well as Cash and his wife, but this film makes the worst compromises. It sacrifices genuine moments of joy in his life for muted paraphrases of them. Film is an emotional medium in terms of storytelling and you can't tell a biopic with it. Often biopics are inaccurate because of this and it seems this one has the reverse problem, they made a dull movie because they didn't want to be accused of sensationalism. That ""d word"" in the last sentence sums up this movie just fine. It's dull from start to finish, it never takes off and it finishes in a way that makes even the biggest supporter of it think ""that's it""  or even possibly ""well, it had to end sometime"" or even ludicrously, ""I thought they were going to cover the later years when he did that cover of ""hurt""."" I can't think of one reason for this movie even existing except for the fact they were cashing in on the bandwagon of people who became fans when the media made a deserved tribute to him when he died. It's possibly and even likely that Cash's life is worthy of dramatization, but what's shown here isn't worth the trouble.  It's not terrible because of the performances, but the performances feel like composites instead of authentic portrayals. I hated that and also hated the fact that I knew there were better actors for these roles as well as better stories to tell. They just seem depressed and without energy throughout.

It was merely Phoenix doing a Cash impersonation the whole movie. For comparison's sake, Gary Busey did a superior job of Buddy Holly. This movie offered me nothing further that I didn't already know and even did a poor job doing it, didn't entertain me in any way I cared to in relation to J.Cash, and I found it merely a stepping stone for it's actors. Anymore, you do a great impersonation of a famous celebrity or historical figure, you change yourself form a supermodel to a loathesome murderer (see C.Tiegs in ""Monster"") and you have the Academy and movie goers talking about you as if you just invented celluloid. This movie is okay for those who didn't necessarily grow up on J.Cash. To those who've followed him for decades, even subjected to ridicule for doing so by the very folks who now claim J.Cash fanaticism in hindsight, this movie just didn't do it for me. As far as Phoenix, this isn't even his best role. I liked him better in ""Inventing the Abbotts"" much better than this one (I actually liked that movie better than this one, but that's another debate.) In short, this is one of those, ""the audience loves the movie for who's in it."" I can't sit through more than 10 minutes of this masquerade. I seriously think it's no more than a high school production of a portrayal of one of my favorite artists ever.

Good performances are here, though, from several actors, but I was disappointed in Walk the Line, mostly because this film wasn't what it could have been or should have been or what I wanted it to be. I know it wasn't my production and others, including Johnny Cash, who gave his approval to the project before his passing, made this the story they wanted to tell, but speaking personally, I think this was both a needless assault on a cherished myth and a bit of a tall tale in itself that sacrificed fact for drama and re-wrote entire timelines. I know we live in the golden age of bringing down heroes and showing that the famous are as fallible as the rest of us, but why on earth concentrate on the aspects of the Cash's relationship that were so overly emphasized in Walk the Line? And then why re-imagine them when the truth made a better story in itself? Johnny Cash was a legend and deserves his own tribute in film. Maybe someday.",1199059200,,1342,4.459349593495935

Walk The Line  is a movie about the tumultuous love affair between the country and western singers Johnny Cash and his bride to be June Carter. It stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.

He is believeable and wears the Johnny Cash personality, carries himself off as Johnny and even sounds like him. His protrayal of Johnny's life and the struggles he had through life, were shown in such an authentic way. We see JR (Johnny Cash's nickname as a youngster) live a life no one should have to live as a child growing up. His father shows no qualms about the fact that he wishes JR had died, and not the older son. JR loved his brother and lives forever with the haunting fact that his father will never love him. Even later in life, the father proves to be a bitter man for many years, until life comes to terms for Johnny after he marries June Carter. The Carter family prove that love and understanding of others, even when most people give up on them, can conquer all. Wisdom, compassion and goodness flows from the Mother and Dad Carter, and you can't help but wish to have known them personally in your own life. Joaquin does a marvelous job in this movie.

There's nothing about her that is even remotely passable for white, except for maybe her hair. Do they have a problem with letting the world know that his first wife was a black woman? She was obviously not white. This inaccuracy ruins the film for me because it leads me to believe that the makers of it are racist.

""Walk the Line"" has one of the finest scenes i've ever seen in any movie.  toward the end, we see Johnny hosting a family gathering.  now that he's been off substances for awhile and been behaving like a responsible husband and father, Cash and his pappy are finally reconciled.

Cash's two young daughters are trying to talk to their grandfather through styrofoam cups attached by a string.  but, neither they nor their grandfather can hear anything through the cups, because the string is hanging loose.

Johnny explains to his pappy that the string has to be pulled taut for it to conduct sound between the cups.  Johnny then walks away, suggesting his pappy tell his granddaughters a story.

the father, looking utterly perplexed, says he doesn't know any stories.  Johnny shoots back:  why don't you tell 'em about the time you built a boat and saved your family from a flood?  (the incident inspired the Cash tune ""Five Feet High and Rising"".)

this scene revealed the source of what had up until then been the father's lifelong resentment of the son.  every boy in America knows the string has to be pulled taught to carry sound between two cups.  the only conclusion to be drawn from the father's ignorance of this simple fact of childhood is that he had been too poor to have had a childhood.  growing up in the Mississippi Delta, the father probably started working in the cotton fields around age 5 (the same age as his son Johnny later would).

but, by contrast with his father, Johnny had never wanted to do anything but play.  he was fishing instead of helping his brother when the older boy (their father's favorite) was killed in an accident cutting wood at the saw mill.  as an adult Johnny hadn't worked at a regular job -- he played the guitar instead.  when he wasn't playing the guitar, he was playing around with alcohol, drugs, and women he wasn't married to.

being of Scottish descent, the father was the sort of man who'd have preferred having boiling oil poured into his ear, rather than ever brag about himself.  whereas Johnny's career was about self-promotion, to the point of wanting fans to think of him as some kind of career outlaw, which disgusted the father.

so, even though the father was the kind of man who, like Noah, had saved his family by building a boat with the flood waters rising, when asked he couldn't think of any story to tell -- just the opposite of Johnny.

1607012,3,B00005JO1R,"it was interesting to learn about Johnny Cash's life and music. Although it turns out that his life is just the same as every other rock star whose life gets the Hollywood Biopic treatment.

About this time last year I saw ""Ray"", and the similarities between the two movies are numerous. Both Ray Charles and Johnny Cash are haunted by the death of a brother in childhood. Both struggle against the odds to become hit musicians. Both get mixed up in drugs, and have tumultuous love lives. Both get busted by the police at one point for their drugs. Both eventually get cleaned up with help from their woman.

The similarity of the source material cannot, I suppose, be helped, but I think Hollywood is still guilty of trying to apply the cookie cutter mold to the rock star biopic. Or really any Hollywood biopic. The scene where the husband and wife are shouting in the kitchen and the wife starts crying has got to be in just about every biopic I have ever seen.

Still, I did learn an interesting thing or do from this movie. I guess the biggest surprise was that Johnny Cash, whose name is frequently used as a litmus test for coolness in college dormitories, was once climbing the pop charts and on tour with such common pop stars as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.",1183939200,2,1273,4.5021645021645025
1607053,4,B00005JO1R,"I did not expect much of this bio-pic because I think it is almost impossible to make a good movie about an artist which not only shows the events of his life but also lets a viewer to take a peak inside that artist's mind to show the creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist. In this regard, ""Walk the Line"" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her). Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional. I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent (""Election"") but with her role in ""Walk the Line"" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration.

These two young people deserve a round of applause for their hard work in doing the best they could to portray the characters they represent in this movie.  I enjoyed the story of Johnny's past including little details, like his family surviving a flood and of course the traumatic event of him losing his brother which changed his relationship with his father, which seemed somewhat frayed to begin with.  The set designers did a great job in really making you feel like you were back in that time period as well.

1607055,5,B00005JO1R,"Despite the fact that `Ray' was just released the year prior to critical acclaim, even winning an Oscar or two, and the fact that the life story of Johnny Cash is in a way very similar the film `Walk the Line' does a brilliant job of making this life story all that much more compelling and entertaining than last years submission.  This is due in large part to the fantastic performances of the entire cast, most notably Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and the Oscar snubbed Ginnifer Goodwin who brilliantly balances support, frustration and sympathy as Cash's ex wife Vivian.  James Mangold has that same eye for detail as Hackford possessed in `Ray' but he ups the ante by fleshing out not only the demons that corrupted Cash's soul but also the angel that saved him in the end, notably June Carter.

Right off the bat we are introduced to the Cash household and immediately the lines are drawn as in who the supportive parent and who the dominating overbearing parent is, and when the tragic death of Johnny's older brother shakes things up within that household no one is ever truly the same afterward.  Racked with guilt for not being there when he was hurt and or being the surviving sibling Johnny lived the majority of his life with suppressed grief and constant dissatisfaction with any of his many accomplishments.  The film beautifully flows through his adolescent life in the army, his early life married sweetheart Vivian and then the early points in his career until fame and fortune drove Johnny to drugs and, you guessed it, women.

But it was one woman who stole his heart and cured his soul, and that was June Carter, played brilliantly by Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.  Her charisma, charm and sincerity helped tame a tortured man and gave him reason to believe in himself and in the prospect of living a happy and fulfilling life once and for all.  The film chronicles their love affair from its rocky start, shaky middle and everlasting end and it does so with such elegance and patience that the viewer becomes so invested in these characters as people and we begin to sympathize, rationalize and relate to their very souls.  Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with as he attacks Cash's very being with such reverence and determination that I felt I witnessed the birth of a true star, and Witherspoon earned her Oscar with the same fiery determination evident in her co-star.

The supporting players all pull their weight as well, from Ginnifer Goodwin's Oscar worthy performance to Robert Patrick's sinister father, the man we loathe in entirety yet learn isn't without saving, as well as the entire cast of young actors and musicians all help create a feeling and a mood that perfectly compliments the films purpose.  Not a single performance is forced, out of place or unworthy of mention.

Another highlight is the music, all of which was sung by the actual actors themselves, which is another step-up from last years `Ray'.  Both Joaquin and Reese devour each sung line with enthusiasm and pure talent and it also helps cement them into their characters, fleshing out both Johnny and June and making them more real.  These are in no way shape or form mere imitations.  Both Phoenix and Witherspoon created these characters brilliantly and beautifully.  From the accurate sets to the costumes and stage performances `Walk the Line' is a fantastic biopic complete with acting bravado and a script that truly brings these legends to life.",1182384000,2,3468,4.822934232715008
1607056,4,B00005JO1R,"Stars Phoenix and Witherspoon are the movie. Their performances are top-drawer as, surprisingly, is their singing. Phoenix worked hard to master the tics and idiosyncracies of Johnny Cash. In fact, having seen Cash in concert on several occasions, I occasionally felt that some of the signature gestures, such as the pout and guitar slinging were a bit overdone.

  The storyline wasn't all that engrossing. Too much emphasis for me on a few selected episodes from Cash's life and nothing at all mentioned about many of Cash's excesses.

  Johnny Cash was a solid performer and also a man who made many poor choices in his life and lived with them. I don't think he would have been offended to see incidents like his firing by Grand Ole Opry included in the film, considering that he more than made up for that behavior in later years.

  Overall though, it's a pretty good film.

His voice, both spoken and singing, was absolutely astoundingly similar to Johnny Cash's. And his guitar playing was phenomenal. I believe Johnny himself would have been impressed. This is an excellent film with some insights into the inside of country music and its stars. However, it depicts June Cash as having had pre-marital six with Johnny Cash, which doesn't ring true with me, nor, I believe, did it ring with June Carter Cash's actual life experience. It's too bad when film-makers have to inject falsehoods to attempt to sell movies, especially when it didn't depict acurately Johnny's acute struggles with drugs. I suppose that part of his life was, perhaps, glossed over a bit to not tarnish his later life reputation and in deference to his death. Other than that, all in all, it was a good movie with an absolutely wonderful soundtrack. I did enjoy it a great deal.",1179014400,4,1032,4.869318181818182
1607058,2,B00005JO1R,"I learned some valuable lessons from this movie, and consider myself much instructed thereby.

One thing I learned from watching this is that adultery is cool.  Marriage is just another obstacle to get around.  See, if you've got a dream, and your spouse stands in the way (for example by suggesting that you pay some attention to her and help provide for your progeny), it's totally okay to dump her and latch on to someone more exciting, someone who believes in you.  Everything will be considered your wife's fault for having opposed your dream in the first place.

(Johnny and Vivian's daughter, Rosanne Cash, was reportedly furious over this movie, claiming that her mother actually encouraged her father's music playing, the complete opposite of what is portrayed in the film.)

Is it just me?  Has adultery and dishonoring one's marriage vows gone so completely out of fashion that filmmakers will portray a man callously ditching his wife and family, and yet not even seem aware of what they're showing?  The whole emphasis in this film was on how Johnny's spirit ""needed to be free"" so he could make his wonderful music.  Not a whiff of (or even a consciousness of) the moral problems presented by such behavior.

Maybe I'm just getting older, but I'm getting sick of this crud.  And I've been noticing more and more of it.  Next time I see a movie doing this, I'm just gonna shut it clean off.  Those who toss their wives to chase their muses have nothing to say to me.",1178323200,26,1479,4.686046511627907

1607062,5,B00005JO1R,"This Oscar winning movie is every bit as good as you may have heard. There isn't single wasted frame, and just about every performance is spot-on. But the movie belongs to its two leads. Joaquin Phoenix burns darkly as the young Johnny Cash. His immersion into the role of the troubled ""Man In Black"" matches that of Oscar Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman's in ""Capote."" Even more fascinating is how Phoenix took the time to learn Cash's vocal mannerisms and record the songs for the movie. While Phoenix lacks Cash's low register gruffness, he still convinces as a singer. It really helps in the concert sequences, especially at the climactic legendary Folsom Prison performance.

The same can be said for Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, who continues to grow as an actress. As June Carter, she manages to blend warmth, spunk and humility as she lives a life that runs parallel to Cash's, even as Cash begins to fall victim to his demons. She comes to terms with Cash's ongoing advances, even as she keeps her distance from his drug addiction. And like Phoenix, she sang her parts for the soundtrack. The duet of ""Jackson"" will stop your clock...you'll pause to wonder if they are really singing or if they are miming to the original.

The other singers in the cast are solid in their performances, but particular credit belongs to Waylon Malloy Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis, who plays The Killer as a mischief making imp with just a brief glimpse at his dark side. As Executive Music Producer, T-Bone Burnette does his usual remarkable job at keeping the soundtrack rootsy and authentic. There's great original songs included with Phoenix and Withersppoon's tracks, making sure that ""Walk The Line"" never loses that air of honesty. It cuts off when June agrees to marry Johnny in front of a live audience (essentially losing 35 years of story), but the one thing I can say to ""Walk The Line's"" benefit is that I didn't feel cheated. You'll come away from ""Walk The Line"" with a firm understanding of just why June and Johnny's marriage endured.",1174262400,4,2040,4.792613636363637

1607114,5,B00005JO1R,"WALK THE LINE is a look at the life of Johnny Cash (masterfully played by Joaquin Phoenix), ""The Man In Black,"" one of the most well-known and distinctive singers of our time.  The film starts with his humble beginnings, picking bales of cotton with his brother and parents in the fields and gradually depicts his path to show business, after his term in service in Germany and his job as a door-to-door salesman.  While already married and with a couple of children, he encounters the recently-divorced June Carter (brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon), of Carter Family singing fame (of whom he has been a great fan since childhood).  They are drawn to each other, and this mutual attraction intensifies as they embark on a musical tour together, along with a very young Jerry Lee Lewis.  This also takes a gritty look at Cash's descent into speed addiction and alcoholism and June's devotion to him during this, the darkest hour of his life.

We hear some of Johnny Cash's greatest songs in this film (with vocals and accompanying instruments actually performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon).  These songs include ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" and ""Walk the Line.""  Joaquin Phoenix truly IS Johnny Cash, and you forget that he's even acting.  As for Reese Witherspoon, she earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actress, for her sensitive and beautiful performance as June Carter-Cash.  Their onscreen chemistry is sizzling and they are never hotter than when they are performing together onstage.  The whole film is a great example of cinema storytelling at its best--everything from the luscious cinematography to the great script is truly in a class by itself.

1607115,5,B00005JO1R,"I tend to view biographical movies about recently deceased music celebrities with some trepidation because they tend to turn into overly reverrential epic sagas bordering on hero worship.  Worse, there have been such a slew of them over the years, Glen Miller, Buddy Holly, Jim Morrison, Richie Valens, and mostly recently Ray Charles have all had their lives re-interpreted in celluiloid.  Did we really need another about Johnny Cash?

After watching the movie, I have to say that this is by far the best of the genre I have ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job in his protrayal of Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon is transcendent as June Carter.  The film covers the period of Johnny Cash's life from his days of growing up during the depression on a cotton farm, to his service in the Air Force in the early 50's, his first records on the Sun label, to his prominance as a country music and American icon in the late 60's.

Phoenix portrays Cash most appropriately as a simple man with a surprisingly complex edge.  Cash wanted to be married, wanted a family, yet probably never loved his first wife.  June Carter was also trapped in a series of doomed marriages when Cash first met her.  Their love for each other has to be one of the true great love stories of the 20th century.  The film ends with June Carter finally agreeing to marry Johnny Cash on stage in Ontario, Canada in 1968.  They stayed together until they passed away within four months of each other in 2003.

The movie does a good job of capturing why Cash was so likable and became so loved by the public, and also why he was so unlikable and destructive to himself and the people around him.  A lot of that had to do with his addiction to amphetamines and barbituates, but a lot of it had to do with his childhood, and the death of his older brother.

I have to mention the music in this movie, Cash was a contemporary of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins at the dawn of Rock and Roll and often toured with them.  Cash drew some influences from that, but was also deeply influenced by his mother's love of gospel music.  In the end Cash's music stood on it's own above any categorization of rock, country or gospel.  Something about a Johnny Cash song, the deep growling vocals and the incessant driving country beat just transcends labels, and the movie does an excellent job of making that point.

Just a compelling movie about a simple yet complex man.  The movie doesn't make Johnny Cash into any more than what he was, a man with a gift to put hard feelings into song, but still a man with the same susceptablility to shortcomings as any man.  Great, well acted film with a good story.",1172448000,4,2691,4.509278350515464

1607117,5,B00005JO1R,"Even though WALK THE LINE is labeled a biopic about June and Johnny Cash, it's also a solid love story that will stand for years.  Gradually the memories of the couple's musical performances will fade, but the memory of their love transcends simple history.

Joaquin Phoenix shines as Johnny Cash, the romantic and the troubled drug user, and as the man who lost a brother.  Joaquin probably used the loss of his own brother, River, in preparing emtionally for the role, but that had to have been very hard.  Reese Witherspoon makes acting look effortless.

The movie carries Johnny Cash from his early years, through the tragic loss of his brother, to his love for music.  I remember listening to his songs when I was a kid, but I didn't know that he toured with and around Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis.  I only knew his country years.

The scenes and settings feel right and look right.  The visual storytelling gets choppy and leaves a lot out, but it keeps in all the good stuff as well as keeping the story moving along at a fast clip.

Even though everyone knows that Johnny and June will get together, it's still emotional and uplifting when he proposes to her on stage during a live performance.  The chemistry between the actors is great.  This is one of those movies that fans will watch again and again.  And if you haven't seen it, you should take the time to do so.

1607118,4,B00005JO1R,"We missed this movie in the theater, and it finally popped up to the top in our netflix queue, a bit like cream rising to the top of the milk churn. This is an extremely well done biopic, that limits itself to the early career of Johnny Cash's life. The script is almost a little too clever, or perhaps the source material--Cash's own autobiographies--made things a little too clear, in that sometimes the connections between his actions and his childhood are so strong that it's like the screenwriter went in with a highlighter and marked the passages for you. For example, Cash and his brother go fishing in the first five minutes, and as they walk down the dirt road they run forward and slide in the dirt as well as balance the fishing poles in the palms of their hand. Later, when Cash leaves home to join the army, his joy in finally escaping the harsh confines of his father's house is shown by him running and sliding in the dirt, and then even later in the film he and June Carter go fishing, you see him balancing the pole in his hand, an indication of how much joy this is bringing him.

While almost distracting, such clear connections don't get in the way of the story, and the screenwriters have done a great job in concentrating on the love story between Cash and Carter. Everything in this movie builds to that, showing exactly why Cash was a boozer and an addict, the struggle between his success and his first wife, and how the music connected him to Carter, who had her own issues as the scion of country music's first family. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderfully understated in their portrayals, especially in the darker sections which has to be one of the better representations on screen of drug and alcohol addiction.

What's somewhat missing, although implied in several scenes, is a depiction of Cash and Carter's religious faith. The DVD contains some of the scenes that hit the cutting room floor and it looks like much of the more overt religious parts were excised in the final version, likely because they didn't feed as much into the courting part of their relationship and was more part of their lasting love for each other. If anything, this movie leaves you wanting more, to see a more complete life of Cash, and if anything, that's a triumph in itself.",1170460800,,2295,4.595121951219512

Joaquin Phoenix is extraordinary as Cash, and Reese Witherspoon leaves behind her blond dingbat roles to morph into Carter. Wonderful acting jobs.

But...

I have since read biographies of Cash by those close to him, and am disappointed by the fictions told or implied by the script. For instance, my favorite scene, where Cash plays for Sam Phillips for the first time, is awesome and unforgettable -- except for the fact that it didn't happen anything close to how it was portrayed. That's to be expected in a biopic, but what annoys me is that you're left with the impression that after June accepted Cash's marriage proposal he got clean of drugs and they lived happily ever after. The truth apparently is that he used drugs for practically the rest of his life, trapped by an addiction that damaged his career and reputation, almost destroyed his marriage, and over the years took a horrible toll on his health. We see Cash struggling with drugs in the film, but according to Walk The Line, all it took was a good woman to set him free.

Enjoy this film -- and there is a ton of stuff to enjoy -- but know that it unfortunately leaves us with a simplified -- and typical -- Hollywood ending.",1169769600,4,1346,4.485714285714286
1607120,4,B00005JO1R,"As with the movie Ray, I would think that it would be difficult to make a dull film about such a larger than life figure as Johnny Cash. Beginning with the trauma-inducing death of his brother Jack in rural Arkansas, his overbearing father who blamed him for his brother's death, a tour in Germany with the Air Force where he wrote his first song, and his self-destructive addictions, the film takes us to Cash's eventual marriage proposal to June Carter on stage in Canada. Carter and her parents, for all practical purposes, saved Cash's life and career. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon (who won an Oscar for best actress for her performance) sing Cash's songs; no voice-over lip syncs here. My only disappointment with this film, like the film Ray, is that it ends while Cash is still a young man. He only got better with age. Others have complained that the film makes almost no mention of Cash's rather outspoken Christian faith. But these are minor quibbles about a good film about a great man and musician.",1169596800,,1024,4.726256983240224

I am gald that Reese and Joaquin won a Golden Globe award for best actress and actor for Walk the Line. Joaquin is my favorite actor and Reese is my favorite actress. If you like Johnny Cash and June Carter I recommend you rent or buy it. My Mom and I saw Walk the Line at the movies and I liked Walk the Line. When Walk the Line came out on DVD I bought Walk the Line the Fullframe and The 2- Disc Edition. I can't stop watching Walk the Line. Everytime I watch My Walk the Line DVD I sing along with Joaquin and Reese. I also bought Walk the Line Soundtrack.

1607167,4,B00005JO1R,"The most striking thing about this movie, and something that has been widely mentioned with good reason, are the spectacular performances of the movie's lead characters, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Their acting is tremendous, but as Johnny Cash and June Carter they do their own singing as well, and pull it off remarkably well.  I believe Cash's voice to be inimitable, but Phoenix makes a very good attempt.

Most of the movie's entertainment value comes from the music--the singing throughout is certainly the highlight.  The movie dragged a bit for me at times, but for the most part flowed fairly well, and some of the most interesting events in Cash's life (his introduction to Folsom while in the Air Force, touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and others, etc) are chronicled well.  Johnny's pill-popping addiction seemed a bit drawn out to me, however.  Despite this fact, however, this was a very entertaining movie and certainly worthwhile.",1168387200,,963,5.101910828025478

I cannot say enough about the performances of Joaquin and Reese.  How he missed out on the Oscar is still bewildering to me.  In the 'special' section of the DVD you can hear James Mangold narrate the entire movie while it is running in the background.  You will learn so much about the actors themselves, Johnny Cash and the movie making industry itself.  My son wants to send me to the Betty Ford Clinic and my daughter-in-law suggested Blockbuster for a possible support group.

1607171,3,B00005JO1R,"Prior to watching this, I'd never heard of Johnny Cash. Apart from the fact he'd died, and someone on American Idol had sang ""Walk The Line"", which I absolutely loved the lyrics to. For some reason, I just had to get this film. My dad asked me why, my mum asked me why, my boyfriend asked me why, and I had no really good answer to give them. I just wanted to see it.

I have no real interest in Joaquin Phoenix either. He irritates me. Yes, I like Reese Witherspoon, but the film isn't about her. But apparently, he's really well suited to the role (you forget it's actually him soon enough, even that annoying scar which looks like a cleft palate), and has an alright voice.

Both of the actors did their own vocals, taking six months vocal training to learn and be Johnny & June Cash. I had to actually put the subtitles on for Reese Witherspoon though, with a strong southern accent, I could not understand a word the girl was saying! The songs were could, toe tapping but forgettable - apart from ""Walk The Line"".

My one quibble about Walk The Line, is the fact huge chunks of time were deemed not important enough to be included in the film, making the film seem almost jumpy. There is some stuff I would have dumped in order to see more of his early life, and most importantly, life after him & June finally got married & got together. After getting married, they were together 35 years, why not show some more of that?

I have to applaud Reese, she did hold her own in the film, a role that could have been reduced to a few lines, a song, and more a redneck hick role.

Elvis also appears in this, and although he's not in it for long, he really irritated me, as they could have chosen a better Elvis lookalike from all the thousands that there are out there! I have never seen a guy look less like Elvis ever.

It does get slightly boring in parts, as I've said before, there are big jumps in time, and you feel like there's something in there that could have been shown, and the ending was a bit of a let down. But the film holds well, as do Reese & Joaquin's voices, but I'm still at a loss to why he was so popular.

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine

I keep my eyes wide open all the time

I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true

I find myself alone when each day is through

Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you

Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light

I keep you on my mind both day and night

And happiness I've known proves that it's right

Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side

You give me cause for love that I can't hide

For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide

It's a bit disappointing that more of Cash's early life isn't covered, especially his turbulent relationship with his father, but this is, after all more about his romance with June, which survived his battles with drinking and drugs and the turmoil of being a celebrity. Honest and forthright, this is a heartwarming tribute to one of the most enduring love affairs in country music history. Can't say enough good things about this movie.

Bur durdle dur dur dur durrrr dur...""Hello I'm Johnny Cash and I'm gonna propose marriage to my duet partner onstage during a performance of a song so lame neither of us would touch it solo, so we do a duet"". Did he actually propose to June in that way and finally get a yes?. ""Now I'm gonna go onstage so smashed that I pass out. My doctors call my condition acute wahfloompia. All of a sudden the sufferer goes waaaaah...floomp."" Well, that's an exaggeration, but the way this flick trivializes Johnny Cash's life story is almost that bad. Johnny once told interviewers that he was part of the Rockabilly sub-genre, so called because they were ""rockin' hillbillies"", and that faction also included Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and a few others. It's easy to assume that Elvis was the king of that bunch, and this movie does go a long way towards dispelling that myth. Johnny was the most powerful songwriter of that group, with his Leadbelly-esque compostional style of chronicling hard times. But that's either touched upon lightly or just plain implied and it takes a Cash fan to spot it. Otherwise, for all of its semi-noir approach, this film approaches Cash's life in a rather superficial way. I don't doubt that we'll be seeing it on ABC some night.

In actuality, this movie is both the life story of Johnny Cash and the love story between him and June Carter.  The movie is solid with impeccable performances particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  In ""behind the scene"" feature, the Director himself commented that both performers exceeded his expectations and they managed to get their mannerisms spot-on.  What impresses me even more is the downright chemistry & effortless bond that those performers are able to convey of Johnny Cash and June Carter.  The movie has moments of flashback and it tracks down Johnny's gradual rise and downfall and his victory over his demon in a linear progression and along the way, we get to see Johnny's fascination with June since childhood, how their lives collided, how his persistency finally paid off in winning her heart over.  It's surreal to see his performances together with other prominent performers in the fifties such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis & Roy Orbinson.  Once again, in the special edition, the Director compiles individual performances of Johnny, June and the mentioned three performers into a jukebox sequences that can be enjoyed on its own merit.  The special edition also has interviews of Johnny's friends and relatives who talked about his faith, him as a person (and not simply a singer), the process of getting the real Johnny Cash and June Carter to approve of this movie (overall, it takes a decade to bring it into fruition) and also the making of Joaquin and Reese into the real stars.

And Reese Witherspoon, cast has his lady-love June Carter did a good acting job, but I never really could relate to her.  Yes, there is chemistry between these two actors.  But this film needed more than that to really hold my interest.

One of the problems with the story is that its all been done before.  A musician with a humble background who made good in the music industry, has a deep relationship with someone other than his wife, and who turns to alcohol or drugs because he can't escape blaming himself because of the death of a sibling.  The film ""Ray"" was all about that and was a better film.  ""Walk the Line"" seemed like a weak remake.

1607260,3,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix may have captured the look of Johnny Cash, but little else in this well-meaning but shallow biopic of the country legend.  The movie takes us back to the days before Cash became the Man in Black, subjecting us to an insecure man who struggled with his marriage, love for June Carter and drug addictions, while soaring to the top of the country western charts in the late 50's.  The film is visually very satisfying to watch as Phoenix and Witherspoon subsume themselves into the roles of Cash and Carter.  There are a number of fun cameos such as Jerry Lee Lewis and a young Waylon Jennings played by his son Shooter.  The concert scenes are the most fun, as we get a sense of the road shows that were put on culminating in the immortal concert at Folsom State Prison.

A deep sense of anger and resentment underlies Phoenix's performance, but one never really gets a full sense of the motivating reasons.  All the viewer is given are visual references to Cash's boyhood years when he lost his brother in a sawmill accident and of his father who never forgave him for leaving his brother alone.  Cash seemed to carry this with him throughout his early recording years, but the movie leads us to assume that he drew most of his music from vicarious outlets, creating the impression that this was a man that had been to hell and back and lived to tell the story, with him ultimately admitting in front of Folsom inmates that he never experienced what they were experiencing.

It seemed that what Cash struggled most with was his newfound celebrity status, the unreciprocated love he felt for June Carter and his embattled marriage.  Unfortunately, we never see the charismatic man that thrilled audiences and fans.  Instead, we see a deeply troubled man unable to cope with his life, and June Carter eventually rescuing him from the hole he dug for himself. This movie may have been faithful to his early years, but it was sorely lacking in the energy that propelled Cash to international stardom.",1162080000,4,2011,4.6875
1607261,5,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver two of the greatest performances of recent memory in this powerful film about one of country music's biggest stars: Johnny Cash.

Young Johnny took an early interest in music while growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm during the great depression of the 1930s.  He was very close to his older brother, Jack, but his father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was extremely strict with young John and forbade him from listening to the radio.  John looked to Jack for love and support, but Jack died in a freak table saw accident, leaving young John alone.  John's guilt is not helped when his father blames him for the accident, saying that the wrong son died.

During the Korean conflict, John enlisted in the air force and was sent to Germany.  There, he saw a film about Folsom Prison.  Moved by the film, John wrote a song entitled ""Folsom Prison Blues"".  Upon his discharge from the air force, John returned to the United States and married his girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).  After the marriage, John tried (unsuccessfully) to make a living as a door-to-door salesman.  His heart was really in music, and he managed to get an audition with Sun Records executive Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).  Initially, the audition went poorly, as John and his group stuck to gospel music.  Sam informed the group that people were tired of listening to gospel and asked John if he had any other music to play.  John responded by playing ""Folsom Prison Blues"" and his career took off.

After the success of the audition, John and his band began a tour with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, but there was one particular person who caught John's eye: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Although there was an attraction between the two, both were married to other people at the time.  But the chemistry was definitely there, as evidenced by their magic on-stage performances of such great songs as ""Jackson"", ""Walk the Line"", and ""Ring of Fire"" (which was written by June).  The two toured on and off for several years, and the strain began to take its toll on John.  By the time the decade of the 1960s began, John was fighting a battle against amphetamines.  His marriage to Vivian ended and he sought help from June to overcome his drug problem.  He moved into a new lakefront home after his divorce from Vivian.  While fighting his drug problem, he spent a great deal of time reading letters from prison inmates.  These letters led him to take an idea of a live concert from Folsom Prison to the executives at Columbia Records.  Initially rebuffed, John told them that they could destroy the tapes if they didn't like the live recording.  However, John's ""Live At Folsom Prison"" went on to become one of the biggest-selling albums ever made.

After the Folsom Prison concert, John, June, and the others went to Ontario, Canada for another concert.  During the performance of ""Jackson"", John asked June to marry him.  He had asked her many times before, but was  turned down each time.  This time, however, June said yes, and they were married for 35 years until both passed away in 2003.  They spent their time with their families at the lake house fishing and enjoyng their family.

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are simply perfect as Johnny and June, and both do their own singing in the movie.  Joaquin sounds exactly like Johnny did, and Reese was the perfect choice to play June.  Her voice is excellent as well.  The acting throughout the movie is great, and the songs bring back many memories.  Its easy to see why this movie was such a hit with so many movie critics.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see the rise and struggles of a country music legend.",1161820800,2,3782,4.708841463414634
1607311,4,B00005JO1R,"Not so much the life-story of ""The Man in Black"", ""Walk the Line"" tells of how J.R. Cash became the iconic half of Johnny Cash and June Cater Cash.  It's a story with the ups and downs we've all come to expect from a celebrity bio - the talented artist finds himself trying to deal with family trauma and dysfunction, has bad brushes with substance abuse and is ultimately redeemed by love to become the icon that he's remembered for.  Johnny's start was a precarious one - he sounded horrible until he could learn to channel his past into his music.  The story informs Cash's rise during run-ins with Elvis & Jerry Lee Lewis.  He courts the lovely June Carter.  The Carters are already celebrities in Country music before Cash enters the scene, yet they're down-to-earth, and probably more sympathetic to Cash than June is.  (They get one of the funniest scenes in the movie when, while still June still remains unmarried to Johnny, they giveCash's drug supplier the double-barrel brush off.)  Joaquin Phoenix doesn't quite look like Cash, but he goes the distance when it comes to capturing Cash's talent for injecting gobs of angry and funny energy into his bottomless baritone.  This is best displayed when Phoenix kicks off his show at Fulsom Pen - creating the now historic concert album - with ""Cocaine Blues""; Phoenix plays Cash like a demon, a performance alone that should have netted him an Oscar (he lost to Hoffman for ""Capote"").  Robert Patrick is a surprise with the unenviable job of Cash's father - a stiff and unartistic soul who nevertheless managed to escape alcoholism, yet seems unwilling to help his son out of his own substance abuse problem.

In short, it's funny and sad - something that most celeb bios shoot for, but few achieve.  Even if the script seems to lag, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the day.  If anything, you can watch this disc, just to hear them play.",1161648000,,1892,4.717325227963526
1607312,3,B00005JO1R,"This movie is a good work of fiction, based on the life of Johnnie Cash and June Carter.  You get drawn in and care about most of the characters, good or bad, because the acting is so excellent. The excellent acting is supported by a very well-crafted screen play with some wonderful lines and scenes. It's a treat if you like good acting. However, if you want the real story of Johnny Cash, you need to go elsewhere.

For example, the film makes the central event in Cash's life the death of his brother Jack.  Indeed, the film opens with an adult performing Cash, pausing before he goes on at his historical Folsom prison show, paralyzed by seeing a circular saw like the one that alledgedly killed his brother.
In this film Jack allegedly  sawing wood for a dollar about the age of 9 when Johnny is tagging along with him about the age of 6 or 7.  Jack tells little Johnnie to go on fishing and he will catch up. Jack has an accident and later dies.  Little Johnnie is not there, so his father reproaches him for. Dad heaps a lot of cruelty on this very young child. Guilt and angst over this clouds the rest of Cash's life and poisons Cash's relationship with his father. The pivotal scene in the movie is an adult confrontation between Johnnie and his father over this.

However, this whole business was made up.  Cash's brother died in an accident in high school machine shop class!

Johnnie's first wife Vivian is  a victim of this film. She's portrayed as a very conventional, Southern white wife, who is continually asking Johnny to forsake music to go and work in her father's business. She's quite at home with the Bible-Belt culture of Cash's attempts at a gospel career but seems just to be a conservative anti-music force.  The viewer thinks she wants Johnnie to go back to Arkansas's cotton country.

  However, Vivian Dorraine Liberto Cash was a Mexican-American. Cash wooed her while he was stationed in San Antonio in the US Air Force. At the time Vivian was a student at an all-girls Catholic high school. The film provides no information about the kind of culture and racial clash that Cash's having a Catholic, Mexican-American wife must have been in 1950s and early 1960s Arkansas and Tennesse.

  Instead, Vivian is potrayed as a conservative, money oriented, music hater in contrast to the wittier, more attractive, and more meaningful June Carter. Vivian is also pictured as a fairly unsophisticated looking house-wife type.  In fact, throughout their marriage, Vivian was very glamorous and attractively dressed and made up. She looked more like a movie star than June Carter whose main act until she hooked up with Cash was as a country girl corn pone comedian, a kind of younger version of Minnie Pearl.

The truth is that Johnny Cash quite freely admitted that his marriage to Vivian ended only because of his own drug addiction, abuse, and unfaithfulness. Both Cash and Vivian Dorraine Liberto have said that they would never have parted except for Cash's drug addiction. As Cash said in the 1970s,""I have to take blame for that -- because no woman can live with a man who's strung out on amphetamines

  _Walk the Line_ says nothing about Cash's musical and political embrace of the changes in the 1960s as a result of the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam war struggle, and the youth radicalization.

For example, in the mid 1960s as Cash recovered from addiction, many Country artists backed the right-wing pro-war ""Silent Majority"" cultural campaign against the movements for Black liberation, against the Vietnam War, and for native and prisoner's rights.  I can remember driving through Florida and Alabama seeing promoting then Nashville Super Stars George Jones and Tammy Wynette's appearances at rallies for George Wallace.

 Instead, Cash embraced the music made by the new generation and the political questioning that went on.  The film does picture him doing Bob Dylan's ""It Ain't me Babe"" and listening to Dylan's ""Highway 61.""  However, only a more-than middle aged music buff like me who remembers those songs and the controversy in Country music circles Cash's friendship and performances with Dylan caused can understand what's involved the way _Walk the Line- portrays it.

Nothing is also said about Cash's championing of new-breed Nashville song writers like Kris Kristofferson. Cash's determination to perform Kris's ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" with its references to being stoned on drugs despite NBC's attempt to censor the song was big news at the time.

  When Cash was first invited to the White House by Richard Nixon, Nixon asked him to sing an anti-welfare recipient song called ""Welfare Cadillac"" and Haggard's ""Okie from Muskogee,"" a song that had become an anthem for right wing culture war opponents of the changes of the 1960s, even though it was written as a parody of the ""silent majority,"" by a marijuana high Haggard while he band bus tooled through that Oklahoma town. Cash refused because he did not agree with the outlook of those songs.

  Cash's decision to dress all in black is pictured in _Walk the Line_ as just his choice one time when nothing else was available back in the 1950s.  Yet, his decision to wear black and his identification with it only came in the late 1960s.

Cash always made it clear that he wore Black because he identified with the struggles of society's victims. He wrote a song explaining why he wore black which says: ""I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, / Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, / I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, / But is there because he's a victim of the times.""

_Walk the Line_ doesn't tell us about that Johnnie Cash.

This movie's executive producer is John Carter Cash, the child of Johnnie Cash and June Carter Cash.  I guess to him the most important thing in Johnny's life was his parents getting together.  Otherwise, John Carter Cash wouldn't have been born!  Perhaps, this is why the film streamlines Cash's life down to a fictional romance between Johnnie and June.  Perhaps, his father's political and musical radicalism in the 1960s and 1970s is not to John Carter Cash's taste.

Yet,  John Carter Cash and the people he worked with were able to find some great screen writers and an outstanding cast of actors.  They give remarkable performances that make this a worthwhile film, despite its distance from the truth.",1161561600,19,6408,4.805656934306569
1607313,5,B00005JO1R,"In a time where Hollywood is basically enamored with making ""remake"" movies, it is good to see Hollywood do something original for a change.  This even applies if the movie is a based on an autobiography.  ""Walk the Line"" is a movie that has its screenplay based on Johnny Cash's autobiography (and is also named for one of his hit songs, ""I Walk the Line"").  I must admit, up until the point I saw ""Walk the Line"", I couldn't claim to be a Johnny Cash fan.  However, after watching the movie, ""Walk the Line"" not only did I watch what I considered to be one of the best movies I have seen in a while, but it did give me a new appreciation for Johnny Cash's career.  This is a movie that will hold your interest from start to finish and will entertain you throughout.  Much of the reason for why this movie ""grabs you"" is because of the incredibly strong performance of Joaquin Phoenix.

While ""Walk the Line"" is a movie that covers the autobiography of Johnny Cash, much of the film focuses around his relationship with June Carter - who would eventually become Cash's longtime wife.  The movie follows the first 35 years of Cash's life as well as Cash's battle with drug addiction.  The movie takes us back to Cash's boyhood days where we can get some background of his childhood.  We learn how a family tragedy that occurred as a boy would have an impact on Cash for the rest of his life.  After Cash joins the Air Force, he meets his first wife Vivian (played by Ginnifer Goodwin).  After they have their first child Roseanne, we see how Cash formed a band and got his first record audition.  Following the release of their first record, Cash finds success and soon begins to hit the road touring with some of Rock and Roll's early legends.  During this time touring, Cash meets Carter and soon begins a longtime friendship and attraction to her.  The touring soon begins to strain his marriage to Vivian and eventually will lead Cash to the beginnings of his drug addiction.  The drug addiction will soon impact all aspects of Cash's life - his marriage to Vivian,  his relationship with Carter, and even his career.  The film even documents Cash's famous drug bust at the El Paso-Mexico border.  Cash's marriage to Vivian eventually falls apart.  However, the drug addiction continues.  Eventually, it will be June who will play a role in cleaning up Cash - and eventually will eventually become his wife.  The film will also highlight how Cash ended up doing his legendary performance (and recording) at Folsom Prison.

The one thing I learned about this movie was the relationship that Cash had with the early pioneers of Rock and Roll.  In particular, we see Cash touring with Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley.  This is something I never knew about.  The performance of Jerry Lee Lewis by actor Waylon Payne was excellent.  Although Payne's part wasn't a major part of the movie, Payne still provided the brashness needed to play Lewis - making for some very entertaining scenes.

There aren't many negatives about the movie, but there are two things that I feel are worth mentioning.  While the movie does a great job at chronicling the relationship between Cash and Carter, it doesn't do as good a job showing how the relationship between Cash and his first wife Vivian disintegrated.  While it is clear the drug addiction and infatuation with Carter had something to do with it, we don't seen enough dialogue between Cash and his first wife Vivian as their marriage began to fall apart.  The other negative is that it doesn't focus on Cash's later years - we don't see his relapse into drug addiction (that occurred in the 1980s) and we don't see his later projects (such as when he joined the supergroup - ""The Highwaymen"").

However, it is going to be the performance of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny Cash and June Carter respectively that are really going to be the story of this film.  It is well documented that Cash and Carter (who both would pass away before the film was released), gave their blessings for Phoenix and Witherspoon to take on these roles.  It is clear that they both were perfect fits for this role.  While Witherspoon would garner the most acclaim for her Academy Award Winning performance of Carter (and while I'm not an awards expert, I feel this was warranted), I really felt it was Phoenix's performance that was the stronger of the two.  It is clear that not only Phoenix studied the part of Johnny Cash in depth, but would also completely master the part.  This mastery would reflect on the screen.  In each and every scene that Phoenix is in (which is most of the movie), you see how Phoenix had command of the character.  With all due respect to a legendary performer like Johnny Cash, I actually believed that Phoenix was Cash.  Another point worth noting is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing throughout the movie.  Not only did Phoenix master the character of Johnny Cash, but he would also do an outstanding job at doing Cash's vocals.  Witherspoon deserves a lot of credit too - she did a great job with the vocals as well.  Most importantly though, Phoenix and Witherspoon clearly had on-screen chemistry - and this was very important because the dynamics between Carter and Cash are the core of this movie.

This movie was about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  Some may consider this a ""long film"", but there is not one part of this movie where I lost interest.  You don't have to be a country music or a Johnny Cash fan to enjoy this movie - because this is simply an outstanding story to follow.  This movie is highly recommended.",1161388800,,5640,4.627766599597585
1607314,5,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix does a breath taking job at portraying Johnny Cash.  The mannerisms, the facial expression, the way he held his guitar and hunched his head over, while grinning--perfect.  Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June Carter, and the two of them together constantly steal the show from each other.  It must also be said that both of these actors use their own voices for the songs, and that's saying a lot because the music in this movie is amazing.

The story, the music, the progression of the events is very well done.  One, upon watching the movie, is totally immersed in Mr. Cash's world.  They feel what he feels, see what he sees.  This two hour movie takes us through the past, on an amazing trip in Johnny Cash's shoes as he walks the line.

10/10 Classic.",1160438400,,774,4.598540145985401
1607315,4,B00005JO1R,"This is the best big budget, big screen biopic I've seen since ""Kinsey"", another film that tried to define its lead character through the poor relationship he had with his father.

In ""Walk the Line"", Joaquin Phoenix plays rock-country superstar Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon plays wife June Carter Cash. What most distinguishes this biopic is the wonderful singing of the two leads, who do their own voicing for their parts. Phoenix is remarkable as Cash and Witherspoon somewhat less so as Carter Cash.

The movies takes us from Cash's early boyhood, where his father chides God for taking the wrong son when John's brother dies, through his drug addicted adulthood and failed first marriage, up to the point where he and Carter tied the knot in 1968. They lived together 35 years and died within a few months of each other in 2003.

The movie also includes characterizations of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley, both of whom apparently came of age in the Memphis music scene with Cash and Carter. The film effectively portrays the rigors of the music business in the 1950s with its night after night stops, groupies, bus travel, drinking, drugs and partying, and the way this wears down people and relationships (both Cash and Carter had failed marriages related to their music lifestyles.)

For me, the best part of this picture is the singing. It is universally effective in a toe tapping mood. The movie would have been about half as good without the music. In this regard, Witherspoon was much better here than in ""Vanity Fair"", where her singing of 1800 music was consistently behind the beat and off-key. Phoenix was a near double for Cash, a fellow that was easy to mimic.",1160265600,2,1687,4.8068965517241375
1607316,5,B00005JO1R,I'm not really a fan of country music and I did not much if anything about Johnny Cash. I saw this movie on HBO last night and honestly only watched it because nothing else was on and I heard talk about it at work. I'm glad I did because it was a great movie and story. Phoniex and Witherspoon did an excellent job imo. Even if you aren't a fan of the music the story line will keep you interested.,1160092800,,398,3.9875
1607317,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" is a film that covers the early career of Johnny Cash and his early romances, plus his encounters with rock n' rollers such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley while on tour. My Mum saw it at least 3 times in the cinema, and then went a whole bunch of Johnny's albums afterwards. When it came out on DVD, I had to pick it up, see what all the fuss was about. It's really well done, I thought, in pretty much every way.

Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny, and Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, but after a while I forgot it was them. They did a really good job, I reckon. They really looked the part, they really spoke the part, and really sung it. You could feel the humour, the struggles and the yearning in their lives. Can't say the same about the guy who played Elvis, which is the only thing that bugged me about the film. I mean, he did an all right job, but considering there are so, so many Elvis impersonators in the world, you'd think they'd get someone who looked and sounded a little truer. Ah well. Not really a big deal.

The direction is really great, I thought. I like the way some of the shots helped you guess just what Johnny was thinking just as you needed to in the plot, if that makes sense. The filmmakers definitely have a love of the music and for the man. You can see there's a lot of care taken making the sets, reproducing the instruments and the colour of the 1950s and 1960s. There are a few things to think about besides the music too (father/son relationships, the nature of compassion, etc), but nothing feels forced, it seems to come naturally out of the story. It all feels very natural, actually, that sums up the style very well. Realistic, yet warm.

There's only a couple of special features on the one disc edition, but it's enough for me. There's a commentary by director James Mangold, who describes why he wanted to make the film, what he was trying to evoke, and even reads some parts from the screenplay while its particular scene is playing. There's also ten deleted scenes, also with a commentary by Mangold, and the original theatrical trailer.

Definitely worth a look for music fans, lovers of Johnny Cash and biopic watchers. It's a fine ""line""!",1159920000,,2211,4.425061425061425
1607318,4,B00005JO1R,"I have never been a big fan of Johnny Cash.  I know, I know, that makes me a Philistine.  But his baritone never did much for me, and his hallowed status has always been thrust upon me by his many indignant fans.  Something about the Man in Black makes his most ardent fans want to fight to defend the man and his music.

I mention this only to say that I was not really looking forward to ""Walk the Line,"" the biopic that does for Cash what ""Ray"" did for Ray Charles.  The similarities between these two men and the two movies are striking.  Both feature heroes raised literally dirt-poor, teaching themselves music, making it big, and inflicting damage on themselves and others through colossal substance abuse.  And along the way, they make some of the most beloved music America has produced.

Joaquin Phoenix plays the grown-up Cash, and he nails it.  Cash, with his deep voice and brawler's physique, may be one of the most difficult of artists to channel, but Phoenix does it well.  Initially, Cash struggles as he tries to form an old-timey gospel trio.  But his life is transformed when a music agent tells him, sing like you've got one song left to sing, and God's going to hear it.  Cash responds to this challenge by belting out ""Fulsom Prison Blues,"" and finding the Johnny Cash sound - ""strong as a train and sharp as a razor.""  That Phoenix does all his own singing, and does it well, is a plus to his fine acting job.

Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, a daughter in the Carter family of country music royalty.  On the radio since she was 4, she unwittingly inspires Cash, who listens to her on his old radio as a boy.  As adults, they find themselves on tour, and despite missteps and mis-marriages, an undeniable romance blossoms between these two best friends.  One wonders what she saw in the Man in Black, since he spends several years in a wasteland of drugs and booze . . . and yet while June walks away from time to time, Cash never leaves her heart.  And Witherspoon captures Carter's spunk and devotion, and provides another example of an actress who can really sing.

This is powerful stuff, if conventional.  You don't go to ""Walk the Line"" to see anything original - you go because these are two lives that tell one great story.  And great it is.",1159747200,,2278,4.507317073170731
1607319,4,B00005JO1R,"WALK THE LINE focuses primarily on the early career (1955-1968) of Johnny Cash, Country Music's legendary Man In Black.

Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is raised by an emotionally distant father, an ineffectual mother, and is haunted by the death of his brother Jack in his early teens. Starting out from Arkansas as a ne'er do well, Cash does a brief stint in the Air Force and works as a door-to-door salesman before taking his amateur band into Nashville's legendary Sun Records to take his first steps on the road to stardom.

Playing in a succession of honky-tonks, school gyms, and other seedy venues, Cash hones his craft on endless and huge road tours in the company of such other rising stars as Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Elvis Presley. His growing popularity with his female fans puts breaking strains on his marriage. Along the way, he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) of the famous Carter family. The two begin a tempestuous on-again off-again relationship that is punctuated by Johnny's bouts of heavy drinking, amphetamine abuse and womanizing, as well as June's emotional travail at being an absent twice-divorced mother of two young girls.

Witherspoon, known for her fluffy comedies, won the Best Actress Oscar for devouring the scenery as the deep, emotionally complex, feisty but firm June Carter, who refuses Cash's constant entreaties to marry him, argues him into responsibility, drops him when his behavior goes over the line, and is there absolutely as Johnny battles his demons, kicks the amphetamines, and at last confronts his vicious father. Cash finally walks the line, mostly because of Carter. More than lovers, the two are best friends.

Although Phoenix did not win Best Actor for Cash, his performance is on a par with Witherspoon's. Starting out a bit tentatively, Phoenix's portrayal of Cash gains freight-train momentum as the film progresses, until at the end, Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash. His concert at Folsom Prison is electrifying and profoundly real.

Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the songs, and do it amazingly well. Their performance reaches its crescendo at the close of the film, when Johnny proposes (for the seventieth time) to June onstage in Ontario, and she at last says yes.

Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash remained married from 1968 until their deaths, weeks apart, in 2003. Loving best friends, they stayed together even then.",1159747200,2,2388,5.09462915601023

Not Johnny Cash and June Carter. I really hated the end. I thought it would get in to their marriage but it ended as she finally said yes to his proposal.,1159660800,2,329,3.8529411764705883
1607361,4,B00005JO1R,"""Walk The Line"" is supposed to be about the ups and downs of one John R. Cash, but in actuality, it's three stories in one.  The first story is that of Johnny Cash, who grew up in Arkansas a poor farmer's son.  His father was hard on him and even cruel when Johnny's older brother passes in an accident.  As Johnny gets older, he pursues a career in music.  His first big break comes at the hands of none other than Sam Phillips.  You know him for his many acts which include the King, the Killer, and the Man In Black (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, respectively), among others.  Cash begins to become very successful and slowly spins out in a self-inflicted chaos of sex, drugs, and rockabilly.

The second story is that of June Carter, the ""other"" woman in Johnny Cash's life.  They befriend each other innocently enough, but as they spend more time on the road together, both of their marriages fall apart.  Cash's wife, Vivian, becomes very guarding of her children (and rightfully so), and Carter tries hard not only to save the life of Cash, but also to fight off her urges to love him.

The third story, and my personal favorite, is that of the music created by Cash and Carter.  Their duets are amazing, and they reverberate throughout this biopic.  My personal favorite is ""Jackson,"" but none of the songs in this flick are to be missed.

Overall, this is a wonderful biopic to watch.  I'd have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the music takes such a precedence in this movie, that we are only given a brief glimpse into the torrid life of Cash.  If you're not a fan of Cash's music, you may find yourself bored during the long scenes on tour.  I personally enjoyed them, but my wife just couldn't take it.

The cast is wonderful.  Joaquin Phoenix is almost eerie in his presentation of Cash.  Reese Witherspoon is a spitfire as June Carter Cash.  She delivers one of the best performances of her career in this flick.  Ginnifer Goodwin plays Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife, with tears almost permanently fixed into her eyes.  Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne play Cash's parents, and do a wonderful job of it.  Sam Phillips and his bunch are also gamely represented here.

I highly recommend this flick to fans of Cash or of Country and Rockabilly music in general.  Cash's music is legendary, and so is he, but let us not forget that behind every good man is a good woman (in this case, two good women).  Vivian was there in the beginning, when Johnny was starting on his downward spiral.  June literally saved him from falling into nothingness, and both of these women deserve as much credit for Cash's iconic status as he or anyone else does.

An excellent film.",1159142400,,2714,4.52880658436214
1607362,4,B00005JO1R,"Is it just me, or has biography movies about singers have gotten pretty popular in the last couple of years? First we had Ray, then Beyond the Sea, and now we have Walk the Line, and I am only counting the movies that I can think of, that has come out starting in 2004, even through I do know there has been a lot more movies like this. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they both do thier own singing in this movie, rather in some other movies where they either get somebody to come in and to the singing, with the actor lip synching, or even lip synching to the singer's records such in Ray. And who knows what other movies that we see of musical bio picks, and who will play the role, and will they do thier own singing, or lip synching, either to recordings, or whoemver they get to do the singing voice. The movie begins in 1968, when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is about to do a live concert in a prison. The name of the prison is Folsom Prison, and then we flash back 24 years earlier, when we meet 12 years old (Ridge Canipe) and his older brother Jack (Lucas Till), who live a life on a farm. Jack spends his time with the bible, Johnny listening to singers including June Carter on the radio, thier father ((Robert Patrick) drinks, and thier mother (Shelby Lynne) retreats into gospel standards from the Heavenly Highway Hymnal. But then saddness hits the family, when Jack is killed in a circular-saw accident. And there father says that god took the wrong boy. And then we flash to 1955, when Johnny Cash is married to his high school sweetheart Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin). Johnny Cahs so goes by Sun Studios where he sees aritists pefroming, and decides to become a singer, and even tries out for Sam Philips (Dallas Roberts), and  hits the road, where seen in cameos are Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings), and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne). And then soon he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and then he falls in love with her, and tries to win her over.

Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job of portraying Johnny's highs and lows, and Reese Witherspoon absolutely becomes June Carter Cash. I was really happy with the flow of the movie, it did not dwell a lot on the early years his life as the son of a poor sharecropper, but you could tell that he always felt a guilt about the incident that killed his brother at a young age and that (I don't think) he ever thought he got the 'approval' he wanted from his father. Cash certainly had some demons, I think some scenes were not as gritty as they could have been, especially some of his episodes while on drugs, but producers probably did not want to risk getting an 'R' rating.

Joaquin Phoenix completely nails Cash, and vividly and effortlessly depicts Cash's struggles and triumphs. He creates an empathy for Cash that few movies can rival.

Phoenix's impression of Johnny Cash is an excellent one.  Although he is missing some key elements in Cash's speech (for example why is pronounced with the ""wh"" sound in ""who""), the energy and soul behind his singing and acting is undeniably close to Cash's own personality.

With Johnny and June Carter Cash choosing the actors for their own respective roles, the movie comes as close as the real thing as possible, especially for those who are too young to have known Johnny Cash.  The movie certainly brought new interest in his music, and only serves as further proof that he is legend and that his music will always be popular, transcending the limitations of genre and era.

This being a Collector's Edition, I feel that the value is in the outstanding box and artwork.  At the time of purchase, it was available for $20.86 compared to the regular Widescreen version for $19.99.  What an excellent value! For only 87 cents more, you get a great box and cover and a second disc!

However, I was sad not to see more performances by Phoenix on the DVD.  It would have been nice to include more than what was on the second disc, though these are more wishes than complaints.

Joaquin Phoenix did not look or sound anything like Johnny Cash at all and sometimes I forgot the movie was supposed to be about Johnny Cash until someone called him ""Mr. Cash"" or ""Johnny"". The story was your standard rags-to-riches-to-drug addict story you've seen in every movie about a real person ever.

The movie is pretty depressing, and you really get the impression that whoever this guy is that is loosely based on Johnny Cash was a real sissy, so really the movie is incredibly inaccurate right there because Johnny Cash was totally not a sissy. In the movie he cries a lot and he takes a lot of pills and his career starts when apparently he just randomly decides to play the guitar and start singing, even though at no point in the movie do they ever show him learning how to do either of those things.

There's a scene in a recording studio where Joaquin Phoenix absolutely destroys ""Folsom Prison Blues"" so bad it's like the studio who made the movie hated the real Johnny Cash so much they wanted people who watched the movie to think he was possibly the worst singer ever. I mean it's bad. Like so bad it's ""how did this stay in the movie?"" bad.

Not once in this movie did I think ""Oh my God, Phoenix has totally become Johnny Cash!"" at all. Mostly I was thinking ""Why the heck is that guy from 'Signs' pretending he's Johnny Cash?"" and hating him.

I know Ray Charles worked a lot with Jamie Foxx for ""Ray"" when they made that, and Johnny Cash was dead when they made ""Walk The Line"", so Wa-Keen probably didn't get to spend any time with him. If his performance is any indication he didn't have a freaking clue who the hell Johnny Cash was before he read the script. If I was Johnny Cash I would rise from my grave and smash as many liquor bottles over Joaquin Phoenix's head as I could before my undead arms got tired and then I would bust him in the nuts with a pool cue and finally choke him to death with a guitar string. Then I would feast on his brains, because I'd be Zombie Johnny Cash and I'd still be ten times cooler than Joaquin Phoenix, no matter how many black suits he wears.

This guy is so not Johnny Cash that in a couple of the singing parts it sounds like they had to electronically lower Phoenix's voice to try and get him to sound even a little bit like the real Cash. My girlfriend picked up on that too, and even she was laughing about it. You hear that, Joaquin Phoenix? Girls laugh at you. You're not a man.

Robert Patrick plays Johnny Cash's father, and I was really hoping his arm would morph into a big spike ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day""-style and impale Joaquin Phoenix during one of the like three hundred scenes where the so-called Johnny Cash character gets drunk and embarasses his family.

Either that, or maybe a scene where the real Johnny Cash shows up and fights the T-1000 with a guitar. Throw in a car chase and some singing, a scene where the real Johnny Cash throws Reese Witherspoon through a window and she lands head first in the windshield of a pickup truck the real Johnny Cash then douses in gasoline, lights on fire, and kicks off a cliff with his cowboy boots, and ""Walk The Line"" would have been so much better.

Probably would have won that Best Picture Oscar, at least.",1155859200,5,3279,4.381578947368421

1607489,5,B00005JO1R,"These days it is difficult to know what you are going to get when you watch a movie from Hollywood.  Is the movie going to be a classic, or a pale copy of a pale copy?  There are no worries about this movie; it is a wonderful overview of Johnny Cash's life that hits the highlights and the feeling of his career without bogging down in excessive details.

The movie fast forwards through Johnny Cash's early years, stopping briefly at incidents that had a profound effect on Cash in his adult life.  While little attention is given to details, a viewer quickly gets the sense of how Cash's life was affected by poverty, his brother's tragic accident, and his years in the Air Force.

The movie really begins to take off in 1955.  Johnny tries to be several things that he clearly was not.  A chance encounter with a recording studio soon had Johnny launched on the perpetual touring circuit that was required in that era to popularize music.  Unfortunately, the constant touring was a strain on Cash and the temptations of touring, particularly alcohol, drugs and beautiful women, caused Cash's marriage and career to suffer.

Moving in and out of Cash's life was June Carter.  June was the opposite of Cash - stable and level-headed.  Fortunate for Cash, who realized early in his career that he loved June Carter, June was always there when he needed her.  This movie ends with an overview of the latter part of Cash's career and marriage to June Carter Cash, again providing impressions and snapshots rather than excessive detail.

Johnny Cash was, as many people are, and incredibly complicated person.  It would have been impossible to present the complexities of his life in any detail in two hours.  Director James Mangold went for impressions and key incidents, and we walk away feeling that we understand the person of Johnny Cash.  Mangold leaves lots of room for others who wish to fill in the vast detail of Cash's life, but Mangold has provided the outline and all the detail necessary for the critical early part of Cash's career.

In addition to hitting only the highlights, which keeps the movie moving along briskly, the choice of actors was outstanding.  Joaquin Phoenix proves that his acting talents are as good as or better than those of his peers.  Reese Witherspoon proves that her acting talents have been underutilized in light comedy as she makes the role of June Carter Cash all her own.  Even more incredible, both actors sang the music you hear in the movie.  Considering particularly that Cash had a very unique voice, Phoenix was very brave in attempting the songs, and his outstanding effort helps make his role multi-dimensional.

To further lend support for the quality of this movie, it received 26 awards, including an Oscar, and was nominated for another 20 awards.

Hollywood seems fixated on glitzy special effects movies with mega-million dollar budgets and plots that exist only to support the special effects.  ""Walk the Line"" is a rare movie that reminds us all that Hollywood can still make a great movie that will appeal to those of us that like to hear stories of average people that became winners.  ""Walk the Line"" is one of the best movies of 2005, and is likely to be one of the best movies of the first decade of the new millennium.  Enjoy!",1154822400,,3291,4.739894551845342

1607496,1,B00005JO1R,"I am utterly amazed at the number of people that think this is a good movie. Growing up in Texas, I was familiar with Johnny Cash's music from the very beginning, and, while I was never much of a C&W fan, it is very hard not to like Cash's music. This movie, however, it an insult to his memory, not an uncommon occurence in Hollywood; directors seem to love to trash people who cannot defend themselves.

In ""Walk the Line"", it's Cash who takes the worst hit. Phoenix plays him as if he were ""mentally challenged"", to use the PC parlance. If that were true, the man would never have suceeded as one of country music's greatest stars. Reese Witherspoon turns in an  admirable performance, but never convinced me that it was June Carter she was playing.

I had been waiting for this movie with a great deal of excitement; the reviews raved about it and June Carter Cash had become one of my favorite performers over the years, despite my overall boredom with country music.

When I saw it, however, it made me cringe with embarassment for the memories of Carter and Cash; even now, I cannot even think about ""Walk the Line"" without cringing. What a shame; the story of those two people is wonderful, too bad the movie wasn't.",1153612800,17,1224,4.5
1607497,4,B00005JO1R,"Walk The Line is a well crafted movie featuring exceptional performances.  It's long, and there are whole sections where little seems to be happening, (or worse, the same things seem to be happening over and over), but it's worth it for two short scenes.

The first is when Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) cleans up his act (for the moment) and walks onto the Folsom Prison stage a fully formed star.  At that moment he is in complete command of his technical abilities and sense of self.  He is contrite and cocky, even feisty, and gives his audience exactly what they want and need.

The other is almost antithetical.  June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is alone on stage, bathed in a blue spotlight.  She is performing Wildwood Flower, accompanying herself on autoharp.  Her tone is clean and open, this is a woman who grew up in music, the stage is where she feels most comfortable.  She doesn't dazzle, she merely gives.  Wildwood Flower is an example of purely beautiful Appalachian folk music, a far cry from the ersatz Elvis eyewash forming the foundation of Cash's early career.

Though strong, the film has major flaws.  For one, country music itself is almost a total write-off, it's borderline unlistenable.  Next, Cash was never much of a singer, which explains his tuneless mumbling.  The Man In Black was also just an average guitarist, although he did pen a few catchy songs.  June Carter, by contrast, was a treasure and Reese Witherspoon's performance is nothing short of amazing.  Witherspoon captures all of Carter's ebullience, energy, and sheer charm, without ever seeming artificial.  This raises another point.

Lately it's fashionable for actors playing musicians to do their own singing, presumably in an attempt to lend authenticity.  This charmingly idiotic conceit is exclusively predicated on thespian vanity.  (Does James Brown perform Shakespeare In The Park?  Think about it.)  Film is artifice, acting is artifice, why intersperse documentation?  In fact, having Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon lip-synching would be more, not less, authentic.

Another drawback is that the story, however accurate, is a weather beaten cliche.  A tormented kid of humble means and limited emotional resources fails to navigate the corridors of fame successfully, falls, and gradually pulls himself out of the gutter a sadder but wiser man.  It's beyond tired, it's plug-and-play.  Of course, the Johnny Cash story is already well known so this paint-by-numbers exercise is even less surprising than usual.

Biopics leverage pre-existing fame and convert it to income, after all, the advance work is done.  Since there are no surprises to be had, the only question is - is WTL well done?  Fortunately, the answer is yes.  Phoenix and Witherspoon both dazzle.  Had Cash been more than a two-chord picker boasting a deep baritone and a vocal range almost approaching one full octave, had he, for example, been an actual artist with something worthwhile to say and an interesting way of saying it, it would be easier to care about his simplistic obsession with self-destruction.",1152921600,3,3085,5.1202404809619235

I was initally irritated that Joaquin Phoenix was cast in a role that seemed too big for him; in fact too big for most actors to attempt. But he truly melts into the role and I felt like I was getting a glimpse into Cash as a human being beyond his performance persona.

Phonix and Reese Witherspoon are wonderful together as Johnny Cash and June Carter. The chemistry between the two feels very real and natural. June Carter was an amazing woman and artist and Reese Withespoon gives you a sense of both her talent, grit, and vulnerability. Good as she was, Reese Witherspoon's performance didn't seem worthy of a best actress Oscar.

As enjoyable as the movie was, I found myself getting restless by the second half. I began to feel like I was seeing the same scene over and over again. Johnny Cash does drugs, gets in trouble, disapoints June, and pleads with her not to leave. However well acted, I didn't get any sense of growth or progress in Johnny Cash.

The ending also makes it sound like ""and they got married and lived happily ever after"" Johnny Cash still had a stint in prison , a few relapses, other problems ahead of fim although there's no doubt that June and his children went a long way towards moderating his excesses.

So great performances, nice sense of ""being there"" during some CW history in the making but leaves an enormous gap between the elderly Cash who had come to a level of peace with his demons and the more experienced but still wrestling with demons Cash we see at the end of the film.",1152316800,9,1564,4.496478873239437
1607551,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" is representative of Johnny Cash's life, depicting the rise to stardom and its consequences, as well as brief points about his childhood and, later on, his drug addiction and martial problems. Joaquin Phoenix takes on a tough role as Cash, and does commendable in creating the rebellious man who has high hopes of making it big despite family tragedy and hardships. While the die-hard Cash fans might not be as accepting to call this movie an instant and solid success, I, a new fan of Cash, found the film remarkable and very deserving of the accolades it received in being nominated last year ( I thought this film was far superior to eventual winner ""Crash"").

The most remarkable and entertaining aspect of this movie was the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter), as one reviewer noted. Joaquin Phoenix's ability to make a role like this work, and sing Cash's songs with some success, is what really gives this role much credibility and dignity. Reese Witherspoon's role as June Carter relies on much of what she has had to do before, which is create comedy and be perky. However, Witherspoon successfully makes this role complex and deep, not just one-dimensional, and her ability to portray some of the difficulties that June Carter had in her own life while becoming acquainted with Cash makes this portrayal a success. Phoenix and Carter work well together, and they do an excellent job singing some of the songs by Cash and Carter, as well as performing duets they did together (one of my favorites was ""Jackson"").

The film also covers briefly some of the aspects of Cash's family life, as well as his interest in music. Although this part of the film is perhaps too short (what can you do in only two hours), we understand the heavy guilt that plays a role in Johnny's life for the loss of his brother during his younger years. We also see the riff between him and his father, with Johnny seemingly feeling like the ""other"" son much of the time, and being unable to please him. Johnny derives interest in gospel music, but, when he is told that that won't sell, he pulls out a song he when inspiration hit, ""Folsom City Blues"" (Cash will later play in Folsom County Jail after he gets tons of fan mail after writing that song).

If there is one negative, it is that perhaps there is too much time spent on Cash's drug addiction. Maybe more of this could have been spent focusing on some of his younger years or the later years.

However, overall, this film is entertaining, vibrant, and worth the two hours spent watching it.",1152230400,,2602,4.687089715536105

1607555,5,B00005JO1R,"Every great musician's story is the same: they come from nowhere, rise to the top, begin using drugs and alcohol to relieve the pressure; they fall, only to rise again through one revelation or another. Either that or they die young; in which case, they become immortalized icons despite the manner in which they died (many like to forget that Jimi Hendrix choked to death on his own vomit). Oh, and let's not forget the love story. That's the best part.

 The life of Johnny Cash (Phoenix) was no different. James Mangold's Walk the Line is a look at the early years of Cash's career and his battle with drug addiction, fame, and his past. The film opens as most biopics do, with a glimpse into the subject's childhood with emphasis on one event. Filmmakers like to use this single traumatic event to attempt an investigation into the subject's psyche, though it's usually more complicated than that. The event in this film is the death of Cash's brother, which happens to be the same as what we saw in last year's Ray, the film biography of Ray Charles. The similarities between the two films do not end there.

 We fast forward to Cash's service in the Air Force, where he first began to write songs. By the time he started recording at Sun Studios in Memphis in 1955, he was married to Vivian Cash (Goodwin) and had two children. He and other greats like Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Roy Orbison (Jonathan Rice) went on tour and began to reinvent popular music by giving birth to Rock and Roll. It was on this tour, too, that he met June Carter (Witherspoon), a long-time interest of his ever since he began listening to her family sing on the radio as a child.

 The film shifts its focus to these two. The relationship between June Carter and Johnny Cash was certainly complicated yet it was beautifully unique. For much of the film Cash chases Carter around without success until she literally saves his life, and convinces him to stop using drugs. It is the story of these two individuals that gives the movie the heart and honesty that it holds throughout.

 Walk the Line never glorifies Cash in a way that makes him invincible. Phoenix is quite good at reminding us that he was human, and his darker side often had control. But his affection for Carter was strong enough to save him and inspiration enough to keep him going.

 A common worry about the film, especially for Cash fans, is that this is just another large production to cash in on the new market of musical biopics in which Ray was so successful. Are Mangold and Phoenix just looking Oscars? That doesn't seem to be the case. Mangold understands and appreciates his subject and he's done his research. Phoenix and Witherspoon have put so much time and effort into taking voice lessons to make the film as authentic as possible. The people involved in the making of this film are well aware of the musical giant Cash was and love that Carter and Cash shared.

  As for the parallels this draws to Ray and the tales of other musicians, that is part coincidence and partly intended. There are many scenes that are over dramatized and some even fabricated. These are mostly small details, though, and the film remains credible and unhindered.

 Johnny Cash was a pioneer of Rock n' Roll music and his influence and appeal spans all genres and generations. The Man In Black was the father of Country music and a predecessor of Rock. His story may be one we've heard before, but it's one we want to hear again anyway.",1151971200,,3522,4.594896331738437
1607556,4,B00005JO1R,"When I was little my father would play Johnny Cash records and I distinctly remember ""I Walk The Line"".  While watching Joaquin Phoenix perform the song, you'd swear that it was Johnny Cash, himself.

Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person.  Phoenix has done an excellent job capturing Cash, the man. Not the legend and not what everyone thought he would be. What made Johnny Cash such an icon was that he was an ""everyman"" and Phoenix gives his all to not only capture every subtle nuance but also to make him believable as a flawed human being.  Reese Witherspoon's performance, as well, is surprisingly good. There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde, and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.

The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing.

A lot of the movie was wasted on John's sophmoric pursuit of June. Sometimes he was married or she was married to someone else. It didn't matter to him. He begs her to marry him. It was childish & pathetic as portrayed. A very short movie without that nonsense. Of course the best parts were the stage performances of both of them.

Nope, not really....

The beginning was pretty good and had me hooked a bit, but then like most movies about musicians/bands, it fell apart and they WAY overdid the drugs and drinking. For a good hour this movie was nothing but Johnny taking pills, Johnny getting mad, June not marrying him, and finally Johnny taking more pills sleeping too long.  Thats about it. There was not nearly enough about the music, the creation of the great songs, and other personal events in Johnny's life.  The movie missed out on details that would have contributed more to the story than the cliche ""drink too much and get enraged"" crap.

Also, the film seemed to jump a little too quickly.  One minute, Johnny and his band were really struggling and the next minute they had songs in the top 20.  I missed something here.  It is a struggle to get to the top and this was not portrayed well at all.  He magically woke up one morning and was a star.  I don't expect a two hour movie to show every little step of the way...but c'mon!  There's no drama or intrigue in the ""overnight superstar"" concept.

Still though, some of the tunes were good and Phoenix played an OK Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon as June Carter was decent as well.  However, it was NOT enough to save a weak script and a plot that really didn't know what to do with itself.

I think this film gets high ratings simply for whos in it. If it had unknown actors/actresses in it, it would have likely been trashed.  Oh well....

NOT Recommended!",1151539200,7,1747,4.389408099688474
1607590,3,B00005JO1R,"The makers of ""Walk the Line"" obviously had to walk a thin, shaky tightrope when creating this movie.  There's pretty much a requirement to target the 18-35 year-old audience, and most people in that age group simply don't know enough about Johnny Cash and June Carter to appreciate their vast cultural significance and absolute authenticity.  But, since Cash was one of those rare artists who can truly be called larger than life (and death), he found admirers in that age bracket in the last decade or so of his life.  Still, that cult following isn't enough to fill movie theatre seats, so ""Walk the Line""'s creators were called upon to make some compromises while striving to evoke Cash's iconic integrity.

The result is a solid, enjoyable, and moving film that follows a familiar formula in celebrity biographies: big, pivotal scenes that show the protagonist's tough road to success, with less attention to the complex interaction of the individual artist with her or his culture.

Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix are, no surprise, much better looking and more glamorous, and far less earthy, than the people they are playing, but that doesn't bother me--it's Hollywood when all's said and done, and I'd rather see actors interpret their roles than to try imitating the inimitable.  Having said that, I'll stick with the general reaction and say that Witherspoon is more impressive than Phoenix because she is so much more natural and comfortable inside her character.  I respect Phoenix for doing his own playing and singing, but since I did see Johnny Cash in concert once (and hundreds of times on TV), I couldn't ever fully accept him as the Man in Black.  At the same time, I can't think of anyone who could have done better.  Playing God in a film would be easier than playing Johnny Cash!

The film is well-photographed, and the production design captures the various eras well, even if the film exhibits the sort of slickness and polish that today's moviegoers demand.  There is respect for Johnny Cash, along with an honest depiction of him as a deeply flawed, difficult man.  Supporting performances are strong overall, with the actor playing Cash's grudge-holding father doing well with a pretty one-dimensional role.  Most of all, there's the music, supervised by the great T-Bone Burnett.

""Walk the Line"" is a good, not great movie, but it will undoubtedly bring more believers to the shrine of the Man in Black, one of the most important musicians and songwriters of the second half of the 20th century.",1151452800,4,2531,4.938679245283019

1607592,5,B00005JO1R,"Whenever I see so much ""Oscar worthy"" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.

But they're right for once.

Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.

And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.

Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clichd bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own ""character"", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.

The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.

This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time. Highly recommended.",1151280000,2,2464,4.501118568232662

However this film goes beyond its boundaries, the scenery, the heartache and the raw all inspring performance of Jauquin Phoenix who has come so far as an actor here makes this a stand alone film.

Excellent cast Dallas Roberts also gets his chance to shine the road to redemption through June for Cash and most of all the love between two people which made the last half hour of this film so moving.

Highly recommend and one of the finest and greatest films hollywood has made in years forget Brokeback Mountain and Crash this film has something else something that those two could give there back teeth for & though crually overlooked at the oscars.

This is one film worth going back to again and again and Jauquin Phoenix deserves an oscar just as much as Reese maybe someday!  Anyway terrific film on all counts and it perfectly summund up the era and the music.

This is one of the most fantastic films you have ever see, I guarantee that. It only came out of the small cinemas when it came out on VHS/DVD.

It is a true story of success, fame, drugs, heartbreak and unhappiness - and about getting back on track. It is the story of the great Johnny Cash's life.

Mum (who is a big fan of Johnny Cash) dragged me off to town to see it and I must say I loved it.

What I saw was a movie that's certainly restored some of my faith in big-budget Hollywood pictures, a 2-hour-plus treasure that manages to be insightful, entertaining and - most importantly - real.

The two central performances given by Joaquin Phienix as Cash and Reece Witherspoon as June Carter are runaway successes: each actor, in very different ways, bring individual and plausible life to their characters - no mean feat, when you consider that these characters aren't simple fiction. Their onscreen chemistry is palpable and, jaded old movie watcher that I am, I found myself instantly accepting the bond that Phoenix and Witherspoon portray together. Surprisingly, the vocals are all theirs, too (thankfully! with a vocal style as distinctive and unmistakable as that of Johnny Cash, it would have been stupid to attempt to lip-synch, in my opinion), and here more praise must be heaped on the pair - not only can they sing these songs, they perform them with real spirit and energy.

Another cast highlight is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash, giving an excellent performance as the nasty daddy - perhaps the only flaw of the movie's script is that it does not allow for much development of characters like Ray Cash or Vivian - but Patrick and Ginnifer Goodwin, insofar as they're able, don't allow their small parts to become two-dimensional, so it's not all bad news.

Direction is great - James Mangold displays a real sense of affinity with the music hall style of C&W performance and, as with the rest of the picture, this comes across as a believable, plausible style. Musical numbers are kept nicely and wisely understated and the whole look and feel of the movie is very pared-back, but all the more rewarding because of this.

All in all, this is an excellent character study: two amazing performances from the leads mean that a simplistic plot of boy-meets-girl-and-must-overcome-personal-demons-in-order-to-get-girl is showcased in a beautiful, satisfying and very real way.

I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.

Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.  She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception.

Excellent musical performances and a solid cast make for one great film, one of the best of 2005.

Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as the Man in Black, fully channeling not only his performances on stage, but also his life offstage, his strange obsession with June Carter and his struggles with prescription pills.

Excellent dialogue exchanges between the two keep the movie fun and exciting, with each lead performance bringing something different to the table.

1607699,5,B00005JO1R,"I need to listen to more Johnny Cash.  I haven't heard much of his music, but after seeing Walk The Line, which shows his rise, fall, and rebirt, I realize that I am missing out.

Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up on a farm.  His father Ray (Robert Patrick) always liked Johnny's older brother more, seeing Johnny as good for nothing, and throwing his life away listening to the Carter family sing on the radio.  After Johnny's brother died, Ray blamed Johnny.

While in the air force, Cash began writing songs about being in prison, despite having never been incarcerated himself.  Upon his return to the States, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), despite her father's protests and fears that Cash wouldn't be able to provide for her.  And at first, he can't.  He is too preoccupied with becoming a music star that he can't concentrate on his door-to-door sales job.  Finally, he decides to take his band, which, according to Vivian, is composed of two mechanics who can't play well, to a recording studio run by Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), owner of Sun Records.  Some of the other artists Phillips signed include Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings).  While on tour, Johnny meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who was one of his idols while growing up.  She still sings, but she also performs comedy sideshow routines between the ""real"" musicians.  As Johnny and June get to know each other while they tour together, an attraction forms between them, and they become best friends.  While this is fine for June, who is also married, Johnny wants more.  Soon, he also gets into drugs, which eventually get him kicked off a tour when he forgets the lyrics to his songs and kicks out the footlights on stage.  Meanwhile, his homelife continues to get worse.  Vivian isn't very supportive of him during his dark days (I'm told that the real Vivan Cash was more supportive than portrayed here, but I guess the film needed to make a few adjustments for the purposes of drama), and she becomes very jealous of June's relationship with her husband.  Eventually, Johnny drives away everyone he loves; his wife, his three daughters, and his band.  The only person who sticks by him during his darkest times is June.

While I'm sure that some of the events were a little embellished (as I already said, Vivan's character was a little off), these are all real events and they are as exciting as even some the best fictional love stories.  June's committment to her best friend is amazing, and Johnny's struggle, while not unique, is definitely trying for everyone involved.

Phoenix and Witherspoon deserve special recognition for their performances here.  Both of them nailed their characters so well.  Phoenix was able to perfectly imitate Cash's trademark deep voice and both of them did their own singing!  Every actor involved did very well, but these two were amazing.  It's too bad that Witherspoon gets stuck in so many silly romantic comedies, because she is truly wasting her talent in them.

Biopics aren't my favorite genre of films, but this one stands out as one of the greatest I've ever seen.  It's got a great story as well as an amazing soundtrack.",1148688000,2,3250,4.86
1607700,5,B00005JO1R,"Walk The Line captures Johnny Cash's life from 1944-1968.  The movie's plotline derives from Johnny Cash's autobiographies, ""Man In Black"" and ""Cash The Autobiography"", which provide an authentic narrative of what the man was about.  The film appears to be two films in one due to its immense content of the film that reveals Cash more in depth.  There are the intimate aspects of the man and his music, and how one of the first couples of country music, John (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter Cash (Reese Witherspoon), came to be making the film a love story about the music and between two people.

The film is quite exceptional in capturing the ""Man in Black.""  Viewers will see the forces that drove him to create a unique blend of music that was all heart and soul: gospel, rock and roll, blues, and country-western.  Joaquin Phoenix's did a well-done depiction of the man, and recreating Cash during the years in which he struggled through his rise to fame, and his brief down and out with drugs.  One can see how Phoenix's performance flowed with Cash's influence within him.  Indeed, Cash helped to kick start rock and roll about the same time as Elvis Presley, especially with his involvement with Sun Records.  His story almost falls into the same lines as Elvis', but Cash's experiences looms deeper and darker than the king, which involved tragedy, blood, sweat, and tears, and final triumph.

Walk The Line is recommended for all music lovers, especially those who are curious in understanding the history of rock and roll and the sum of all its parts.",1148342400,5,1565,4.784386617100372
1607701,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" isn't just an admirable improvisation; it is a great movie.  Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) live out the classic love story.  He is in love with her, but she is usually unavailable or uninterested.  There are other fascinating storylines available, too.  The movie illuminates his difficult childhood with his brother's tragedy and his father's abuse.  We also feel the anguish of an artist before he becomes famous.  He must start with an unfulfilling marriage and an unrewarding sales job before he gets to become fulfilled in life.  The steps after success aren't always uplifting either.  He goes through infidelity, drinking, and drug abuse before he sees the light of what success and happiness can really garner.

Perenially, it has been said that the performances in ""Walk the Line"" are remarkable.  True enough.  The story's presentation is marvelous, though, too.  It could have been assembled any way, but we start and end with the ""Folsum Prison"" concert, creating the anticipation and closure we need.  The country music performances are intertwined with scenes about John and June's relationship, and all of it is worthwhile.  While many comments have been made about Joaquin's reinactment of the music, it is engaging enough to work well.  (Subjectively, one of the best scenes in the movie is when Joaquin and Reese perform ""It Ain't Me Babe,"" a Bob Dylan song.)  ""Walk the Line"" is an excellent movie that doesn't require the viewer to like country music (although it certainly helps). The movie is a sincere and flattering portrait of an honest and uncompromising man who was genuine and human enough to represent the tragedies and concerns of all people who struggle in daily life.

1607702,5,B00005JO1R,"I'm always a little hesitant to watch biographical films such as Walk the Line, especially when they are based on someone I consider a personal favorite.  Johnny Cash was the man - then, now, and forever.  Heck, the one and only album my parents and I both own is Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.  I didn't really want to learn anything that might damage my opinion of the man.  Complicating matters, you always have to wonder how much of what you are seeing is accurate and how much is the product of embellishment added to make the story more compelling.  Obviously, I already knew Johnny Cash was no angel in his younger days, but I think Walk the Line does succeed in presenting some of his mistakes and problems in a respectful, realistic way.

As good as the movie is, it does have some weaknesses.  Naturally, it can't cover Johnny's whole life in detail (nor does it try to), but some aspects of the story could have used more depth and character exploration.  I remember hearing that some relatives of Johnny's first wife weren't all that thrilled with her characterization in the film.  Frankly, I found it hard to judge her at all because we never really learn much about her.  One minute, we see Johnny calling her from overseas, then the next they're married, and then Johnny finally hits it big and goes out on the road.  His wife comes across as a rather shrewish sort, and that's unfortunate because she should be a more sympathetic character in this context.  As far as Johnny and June Carter go, I would like to have seen their relationship ironed out a little bit more, as well.  From the things we see Johnny do in this film, it's difficult for me to understand why June kept coming back to him - as a singer or as a friend.  Even as their relationship grew into love, I never really saw any kind of special spark in their eyes for one another.

Joaquin Phoenix does a fairly good job in the title role, but I was never able to look at him and see Johnny Cash the way I could look at Jamie Foxx in Ray and see Ray Charles.  The man in black was one-of-a-kind, especially in terms of his voice, and I think Phoenix just tried too hard at times to become the man behind the music.  He especially over-emphasizes Cash's mannerisms onstage, and that just kept disconnecting me from the film.  Casting Reese Witherspoon as June Carter ended up being the Hollywood coup of the year, as she does turn in a wonderful performance, but somebody was asleep at the wheel when some of the other cast members were selected.  Personally, I think terrible mistakes were made in the casting of actors to play Elvis, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and some other well-known musicians.  Orbison ended up looking like some chess club geek, while Jerry Lee Lewis looked like he should have been hanging wallpaper somewhere, far away from any stage.  It's like they cast some of these parts by pulling random names out of a hat or something.

Despite the questionable casting decisions and some obvious gaps in the chronology of the film, Walk the Line does tell a compelling story about a true icon of the twentieth century.  One of the qualities that made Johnny Cash unique was his humanity.  No matter how big he got, he always seemed to be one of us, a regular guy who made mistakes just like we all do.  That's why the Folsom Prison album seems to stand at the very nexus of Cash's career - even hardened criminals felt like Johnny was one of them.  If he could turn his life around after hitting rock bottom, so could any of them - or us.  I think this inspirational message could have been communicated a little more effectively in the movie, but it certainly makes the story worth telling.  Johnny Cash fan or not, Walk the Line is a movie worth watching.",1147824000,4,3758,4.4867647058823525

Joaquin Phoenix can actually sing quite well.  I understand he doesn't sound EXACTLY like the late Johnny Cash.  Does anyone?  Joaquin's look and careful gestures brought a very genuine interpretation of the celebrity into the film.  Reese Witherspoon is no less compelling as his partner and love interest June Carter.

This biopic provides us with the bittersweet details of Cash's personal life, and it's a tale worth telling with a touch of drama here and there.  Cash's search for identity and self-fulfillment is a journey anyone could understand and the mistakes and bad judgements he makes along the way prove his own humanity.

Cash and Carter are examples of what real Christianity and faith are about.  Rather than make pretenses of superiority, they made their mistakes and still kept trying to be better people.  When Cash brings his life together you want to clap for him like the hero he is.

Watch this film, even if you think Cash's music is the worst you've ever heard.  This is the tale of a truly human hero.",1147737600,2,1279,4.976415094339623

Jaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job in filling the big shoes of the rock legend. He's so convincing that, at times, I had to remember that he was an actor and not the real Johnny Cash. But, I would say that Jaquin Phoenix deserves an award for completely giving you the natural performance of Johnny Cash's life and memoirs. This movie made me fall in love with Bio-pics all over again.

Reese witherspoon, in a depature from her regular movies, plays a convincing June Carter who is slightly interested in the mysterious, yet humble, sometimes crazy confident Johnny Cash.

This movie is definetley for those who want to relive what it was like in the 1950's - 1960's when the dawn of a new sound in music emerged and said, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""

It's a really great movie. A definite ""must have.""

""Walk the Line"" is a wonderful story of both of them, put together and fully adapted by Director, James Mangold.

Honestly the acting by Reese Witherspoon & Joaquin Phoenix was simply astounding, Neither Withspoon or Phoenix looked anything like the people that they were playing... yet they fought threw that slight disadvantage to pull of some simply exceptional acting performances. I thought that Phoenix did just as well as Jamie Foxx did last year playing Ray Charles,... It was dissapointing because I really thought that he deserved an Oscar for his performance in this role BUT Philip Seymor Hoffman also did a knock out job playing Truman Capote, bad luck for Phoenix.... Witherspoon also did an awsome job playing the up-beat country singer, June Carter Cash, though she says she really had to battle with singing and not breaking any mirrors while doing so, I really thought she sang rather well, that goes for Phoenix as well.

The screenwriting was also pretty while written as well as just about every other type of production for this film. After all these wonderful comments on ""Walk the Line"" I am sure you are wondering why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, ... the reason comes down to age, as I said I am 16 and I really don't care about the Cash's so I cant say I loved it because well ... I didn't ... BUT it must be a pretty good movie for me to like even though I don't much care for the topic! haha!

Great film for all adults as well as teens that somewhat care about Cash (which is highly unlikely...)

1607706,5,B00005JO1R,"This movie was a great reflection of Johnny Cash's life. However, I think it could have been longer. It spends brief moments on his childhood and on his adult life as a star. Flashing from one moment of the childhood tragedy of the death of his brother. Then to his failed marriage to Vivian Cash.

The one thing this film did focus on was the relationship that Johnny Cash had with his father after the death of his older brother Jack. The arguments between him and his father who never seemed to think that anything Johnny ever did in his life was worth anything. Complaining about his failed career as a door to door salesman which barely put food on the table and a roof over his families head which was not the life that his wife Vivian was accustomed to.

Then, Enter the fiery June Carter, who becomes johnny's singing partner, they record and perform some of the greatest hits in Country music history such as ""The Ring of Fire"" written by June Carter about falling in Love With Johnny and ""Jackson"" which they performed together after Johnny's Marriage Proposal to June on stage, She later helps Johnny through his drug addiction.

1607707,4,B00005JO1R,"""...Everything about him was as big and black and broad as the Arkansas delta, from his physical stature and persona to ""that"" voice.""

Johnny Cash was exceptional.

""..(H)is life cannot be reduced to a metaphor. It was more than just one of noble ambition or grandeur of design; Johnny's virtues were just as hard-fought as his vices. In life Johnny Cash struggled for and against the God whose grip on him was so frustratingly and thankfully relentless that it was able to absorb all that fierce rage and all those addictions. Johnny could sing about murder and God in the same song and with the same voice because to do otherwise would have been dishonest. At the same time, he let that despair, agony, and rejection stand on their own-he lent them integrity. There was no serious salvation unless there was first some serious sin. Cash echoed St. Paul: ""It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."" But there is at least one thing that Cash never was, and that is a moralist. He did not chalk doubt up to a misunderstanding. Rather, Cash showed that doubt is itself proper to faith. A God who could not stomach the darkest moments of His creation was not worth our worship, much less a song.""

This quote is from a fine article by [...], a theologian at Baylor University, discussing his long fight with cancer and his death at ""First Things"".

""Johnny Cash died in a way that demonstrated what it might mean to die well. Unlike those who die quickly, he was graced with the company of friends and loved ones, yet he never used his illness as a pretense or a front. His end was slow, painful, marked with tremendous accomplishments (even for a healthy person), but he drew near it honestly and unsentimentally. His spirit was scarred, busted, threadbare, but fearless, peaceable, witty and wise. In his living, playing, loving, and singing, he also sounded out the timbre of the Christian faith and showed how it ought to be lived: stammeringly, tunefully, with no overdubs and no effects. But most of all, with soul.""

Songwriter Rodney Crowell had this to say about his former father-in-law's passing. ""Johnny Cash will, like Will Rogers, stand forever as a symbol of intelligence, creativity, compassion and common sense.""

They don't make them like Johnny any more. It's great movies like this are helping spark the interest of a younger generation.",1147305600,3,2361,4.76039119804401

I, like most people in my age group, have heard of Johnny Cash or seen him on an award show, etc.  But, I have never been a fan until now.  I just can't imagine why 'Walk the Line' is being compared to 'Ray'. ?? Both movies are great portrayals of two famous individuals - each person helped to define contemporary music.  Does liking 'Ray', mean that you don't like 'Walk the Line' or vice versa?  Why can't people enjoy both movies?  There have been hundreds of movies produced about the trials and tribulations of some famous individual - shouldn't we compare those movies to `Ray' and `Walk the Line' - to be consistent?  There is no doubt that Joaquin Phoenix deserved the best actor award trophy over Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Mr. Phoenix's performance was flawless.  On the other hand, I could barely stay awake during Capote and can't recall a quotable line.  Walk the Line will stay in my memory (along with other great movies) for years to come.  That to me is the hallmark of a good movie.  I own both the DVD and the CD, because that movie was awesome.  In the reviews, someone wrote that there was too much Joaquin in the movie.  I say there wasn't enough.  Anytime an actor makes you want to learn more about a famous individual or a different genre of music - that actor has done his or her job.  Similar to `Ray', where Jamie Foxx's portrayal made me appreciate the music of Ray Charles, Joaquin Phoenix made me want to hear more Johnny Cash tunes and learn more about the man in black.  Walk the Line is a fantastic movie and I am sure that we will see many more great performances from Joaquin Phoenix.  Let's hope the Academy wises up and gives Phoenix his due.",1146614400,5,1745,4.4
1607769,4,B00005JO1R,"""Walk The Line"" is a powerful portrayal to the human spirit, love, and the struggle of the crazy dream. The movie in a sense is a great bio-music pic... much like ""Ray"" or ""Beyond The Sea"". But, this movie will not just make fans of Johnny Cash but will appeal to, all movie-goers . The story focuses mainly on the love affair Cash had with June Carter rather than a 'bunch of facts' that relate to Cash's life.

The love affair with Cash is not only interesting but, it is relatable and unbelievable sweet. Reese Witherspoon got a well-deserved Oscar for her performance- she gives perhaps the most honest portrayal ever done on June Carter Cash- a smart, intelligent, family orriented women- (which Reese also is).

Phoenix looks the part- but in this movie he actually acts the part too- and deserved an Oscar for his performance. The performance is so authentic it is hard to seperate the man from the legend- and the actor from the man. He is GREAT and gives the PERFORMANCE that Cash himself would be proud of.

What is even more amazing is the music-both actors sing their songs and REALLY well- the music fits in well with the period and done in chroniological order that makes sense- unlike most bio-music pics.

The movie is definately one of the movies that is ""must see"" the movie is heartwarming, heart-breaking,and amazingly humorous at times...like when Johnny is a rut financially, loses his car, and is on drugs- he walks for miles to June Carter's house a ritual he calls his ""June Carter love walk."" Both actors give great performances and enduringly sweet. This is definately a movie I'll watch more than once and one to have in your collection!!!

1607771,5,B00005JO1R,"For the duration of this film 'Walk The Line', asks one pretty easy question and any girl would usually be dying to hear what Johnny proposes, and answer in the affirmative. ""Will you marry me?"", or ""One day I am going to marry you."" Followed closely by an ecstatic ""YES!"" Only for struggling song-writer Johnny Cash life hasn't been so kind and when he meets June Carter this task will be easier said then done. After a stint in prison on drugs related charges, and the death of his brother in a sawing accident, of which he feels responsible, when treated with contempt by his father Ray (Robert Patric who starred in James Mangold's earlier film 'Cop Land' and James Cameron's 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day) who has left issues between himself and his living son unresolved for years. It is while in jail, and after his release, where Johnny Cash decides unusually to make music for those in prison, because he can relate to them the most I guess, and because he's had first hand experience there, and so he dismisses most concert stages in the process. It is during a live function Johnny attends while trying to break into the music industry, around the time of Elvis, and make a name for himself that his eye is taken instantly by a girl called June Carter. It's the two leads lively, often witty repartee that got my interest and kept it. I felt very much like Johnny Cash, as well as feeling like I was back in high school, where feelings are hightened, when any girl could catch my eye, or anyone's for that matter, and  playfully make promises of staying together forever, but for some, drifting apart is the most likely of outcomes. I have to say I really admire the determination of Johnny Cash as he pursues the girl of his dreams and her refusal makes Johnny more determined then ever to make her his.

At the start of the film I thought, 'Walk The Line' felt like something out of 'The Andy Griffith Show' intoduction, because it has a fishing poll in it, just obviously without the infamous whistling tune that accompanies Andy Griffth and a little Ronny Howard walking down to the river with their fishing poles.

I saw a special sneek preview of 'Walk The Line' weeks before it hit Australian cinemas on February 2nd 2006. Instead I saw it on 25th January 2006. 'Walk The Line' marks my second special screening of a Reese Witherspoon film before the official release date. The first film I saw of hers before everyone else was 'Legally Blonde 2: Red White and Blonde'. So I felt very fortunate and honoured to be part of another special screening. Before seeing the film I really knew nothing about the real-life late singers Johnny Cash or June Carter and where their lives lead them on tour after tour. It is a story of love, but also many others that this 'Walk The Line' film travels along, and sometimes crosses over, as it explores the entertaining life of Johnny Cash. At times it did feel a little like 'Ray', which is a great movie, I just felt 'Walk The Line' was much better.  All I knew of this film before I saw it, was the poster art of Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon in a passionate embrace, as they bask in the warmth of the spotlight together; both bodies totally consumed with desire for each other. As well as one preview for the film, which includes a totally cool still of the actors of today as their characters in a black and white comic book black line drawing sketch, as their names appear on the screen giving the preview a really neat edge.

It took seven years for 'Walk The Line' to come to the screen. It fortunately had the blessing of both Johnny and June and they both worked hard with director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted) to get the film right. One of the best things about 'Walk The Line' is the real people also got to pick who they wanted to play them in the film. Joaquin Phoenix was the ideal choice for Johnny Cash, who decided on him after enjoying Joaquin's performance in 'Gladiator'. The only thing I know about June's choice was that she wanted Reese Witherspoon, and that they never got to meet. June Carter you certainly know talent when you see it! One of her family told Reese her breasts weren't big enough, but that's never a concern for me, and it thankfully wasn't for anyone making the film. Amazingly to some both actors really sing and play, and it was equally hard at times for each individual actor, but both Joaquin and Reese really smoulder together, and it's a real joy watching them work together. Even though initially Reese hadn't planned on singing in the film, I knew she could sing beautifully after watching her in 2004s 'Vanity Fair', and she really doesn't disappoint here. I'm so glad there is a soundtrack featuring the actors singing themselves. It was something I hoped for while watching the film. I also really enjoy Reese's scenes with the autoharp even though that was a difficult instrument for her, however you'd never know because she pulls it off effortlessly. I'm already a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon's work, but here all her excellent work in previous films is put to the test and she succeeds with a performance I'm very proud of. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheonix are the only two actors I imagine in these roles. There is no one else. Although now I'm certain there are girls everywhere hoping for a 'Walk The Line 2'. I never see it happening, but just for fun, and to prove how popular this movie seems here are a few examples. I read Kirsten Dunst was hanging out with Joaquin Pheonix around the time of this film, so maybe she wished she was Reese. I wouldn't blame her if she did wish that. I read an article about Amanda Bynes, who loves physical comedy, but during an interview for her film 'She's The Man' wanted an Oscar one day like Reese Witherspoon recieved for 'Walk the Line'. Amanda Bynes says... ""She won a role in 'Walk The Line' where, though it's serious content, she was playing a goofy character. I feel I could easily do that."" - Amanda Bynes. Accept no imitations or substitutes! 'Walk The Line' goes it's own path and takes it's time getting there but it's worth the long haul. Purhaps best of all is the fact you don't have to love country music to enjoy this film. This is a film worth waiting in line for. I'm sure the DVD commentry with director James Mangold will be very informative and a delight to listen to. I've no doubt in my mind 'Walk The Line' will become a classic in years to come. I feel the real Johnny Cash and June Carter would commend this film and be so proud of their choice of actors, who keep their spirit alive, as both actors step out onto the stage and glow like the angels the real singers have now become, they are forever immortalised in the warm radiant glow of bright lights on the silver screen for all to now admire, desire, and aspire.",1146528000,4,6820,4.519028340080972

1607773,3,B00005JO1R,"""Walk The Line"", written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold; directed by James Mangold.

""Walk The Line"" will inevitably be compared (at least from now until Oscar time) with ""Ray"", Taylor Hackford's popular biopic of Ray Charles.  Is it a better movie?  Is Joaquin Phoenix better than Jamie Foxx?  And so forth.  The answers, at least for me, vary quite at bit.

Mr. Phoenix's Cash is simply not as vivid as Mr. Foxx's Charles.  His resemblance isn't as strong, and his vocals are initially shaky - the scene where Cash comes into his own during his first recording session isn't very successful - but he becomes more convincing as the film progresses.  Perhaps because I have no knowledge of June Carter's music, Reese Witherspoon's singing is far more successful.

In general, though, I think ""Walk the Line"" is a more satisfying film than ""Ray"".  Granted, I grew up with Johnny Cash's music, and consider him to be one of the best country performers of all time, so I'm not sure how objective I can be.  What truly sets ""Walk The Line"" apart, though, isn't the music or the plot, but the choices of what the filmmakers decided to show us.

The films opens strongly with the Folsom Prison concert - beginning as a distant thrum outside its walls, slowing building to a roar as we make our way toward the performers.  This bookends the film, with the main body of the story spanning about thirty years.

Perhaps inevitably, much of the film has a great deal of plot similarities with ""Ray"" - nascent beginnings, a troubled childhood, marital discord, infidelities, substance abuse, creative conflicts and triumphs.  This familiar chain of events is a weakness, and keeps ""Walk"" from being a truly great movie.

Its main strength is that it doesn't try to encapsule all of Cash's life, but chooses instead to focus on one of its most emotional, sympathetic periods.  His long term romance with June Carter is the film's true body, culminating in her acceptance of his proposal in 1969.  Reese Witherspoon is terrific in the role, giving the film much of its spark and spine. It's a lively, heartfelt performance that makes Mr. Phoenix's passionate pursuit of her so convincing.  Their chemistry together is strong, providing the film with extra heat.

""Walk The Line"", then, reads more as a love story than a biography, which makes the inevitable summation paragraph (usually involving another forty or fifty years of the artist's career) less disappointing.  ""Ray's"" attempt at biography was far more frustrating in this regard.

""Walk"" also gets more help from its supporting characters.  While ""Ray's"" supporting cast had a tendency to fade into the background, ""Walk The Line"" has a better spread of memorable performances, especially Waylon Payne's Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dallas Roberts making the most of his brief appearance as Sam Phillips.

The use of music in the film is also strong, supporting the emotions of the content, rather than receding (as can often happen) into montage wallpaper.

In the end, ""Walk The Line"" has its flaws, but is still a compelling and emotional story.  Like ""Chaplin"" before it, I'm definitely motivated to dig up Cash's two autobiographies and learn more.",1146441600,5,3194,4.923364485981309

1607777,5,B00005JO1R,"Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of the Oscar for Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon), Walk The Line chronicles the life and times of legendary country music star Johnny Cash with an intense, and sometimes dark, intimacy. Following on the heels of the previous year's Oscar Award-winning picture Ray, based on the life of Ray Charles, I entered the theater under the mistaken impression that Walk The Line would be a cookie-cutter attempt to capitalize on the various themes of that picture's commercial success. But although the dramatic personal struggle with drug addiction is prevalent in both films, Walk The Line was more than able to stand on its own as a powerful and impressionable big screen biography. And just like the aforementioned film, you leave Walk The Line with a renewed interest in the music of Johnny Cash and a deep personal attachment to the lives of Cash and his likeable wife, June Carter.

Directed by James Mangold, the talent behind such notable films as Kate & Leopold (2001) and Identity (2003), Walk The Line begins in the rough and tumble world of Depression-Era Arkansas where a young Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) tends to the family cotton farm with his parents and older brother. Early on, a family tragedy strains the relationship between Cash and his father, providing a glimpse into the epic moment that would shape his life forever. Soon after, the film jumps to the early 1950s where Cash perfects his guitar talents while stationed overseas in the Air Force. His marriage to high school classmate Vivian Liberto lands the two in Memphis where Johnny supports the family as an appliance salesman while pursuing his musical interests on the side. Here, Cash founds The Tennessee Two with bassist Marshall Grant (Larry Bagby) and guitarist Luther Perkins (Dan John Miller), and the trio plays its way to a music deal with local label Sun Records.

As part of a promotional campaign, Cash is put on tour with other ""rockabilly"" newcomers Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Carl Perkins (Johnny Holiday). But during his tour with the quartet, the life of Johnny Cash takes numerous turns. He meets the affable June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), begins an addiction to amphetamines and alcohol, and watches his marriage to Vivian deteriorate under the strain of his constant absence. All three would come to define the next fifteen years of Cash's life as he struggled to triumph over his personal demons. Despite his all-encompassing drug addiction, Cash nevertheless manages to crank out hits, but his personal life hits rock bottom following bouts with divorce, loneliness, depression, and his continued drug addiction. When Cash reunites with June Carter in a musical collaboration, the magical bond between the two is amplified. But Johnny's addiction threatens to ruin everything they've built together...

The most impressive aspect of Walk The Line, aside from the storyline itself, is the performance of Witherspoon and her counterpart Phoenix. Amazingly, both provide their own voiceovers, and for the casual listener, very little difference can be detected between the Hollywood talents and the real life country music legends they impersonate. Much was made of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix in the days leading up to the film's release, but I came away more impressed by Witherspoon. Apparently, so did the Academy because they awarded her their highest honor for the role. What stood out the most was the actress's down-to-earth smile and charismatic mannerisms. She created a character with ample assertiveness, yet one that burst at the seams with an infectious optimism and love for life. As such, the audience can't help but fall in love with June Carter. In addition, Witherspoon displays an amazing singing voice that accurately captures the distinct and unique aspects of June Carter's talent. Overall, Walk The Line is a fine film, and a fitting remembrance to the career and life of country music's greatest icon, Johnny Cash...",1146096000,3,4031,5.151145038167939

Joaquin and Reese were beyond awesome in this, I love their singing! I'm not a huge fan of Johnny Cash, but this movie really riveted me and made me look up more of his songs.

And it certainly solidified my belief that Joaquin Phoenix is one of THE best actor's of this age.",1145923200,,311,4.344827586206897

That said, as Jon Steward so ludely put it at the Oscars, this movie is ""'Ray' with white people"". Personally, I very much liked ""Ray""; however, I feel that ""Walk the Line"" is much, much better. It does have the same basic story line, but I feel the performances by Juaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon together were far superior than most of the performances in ""Ray"". Also, there is a true love story behind this movie...although Johnny Cash cheated on his first wife and that marriage did not work out, he was basically in love with June Carter from age 10 on, and to me that makes a true life story. Definitely a must-see, whether you like country music or not!",1145836800,2,828,4.594594594594595
1607848,4,B00005JO1R,"Johnny Cash is one of America's most legendary musicians. One of those rare artists that manage to transcend the genre they're moving in. Although Cash is unmistakably a country artists he always managed to appeal to a much broader audience.  In the fifties he had much appeal to the R&R audience of Elvis and Roy Orbison. In the sixties he became part of the protest generation because of his outlaw image and prison records.  In the nineties he came back courtesy of Rick Rubin. He was then embraced by both the alternative audience and the gansta rappers. At the MTV video awards Snoop Dogg paid homage to him, and numerous rockers took on his songs as he did with them. A movie on his life was just waiting to happen.

In Walk The Line director James Mangold takes a pretty straight forward approach to telling the Cash story. The movie follows a chronological path to the Folsom Prison concert. The registration of this concert would become his most enduring and biggest selling records. Joaquin Phoenix makes a convincing Johnny Cash. His posture, expression and way of handling himself seem to bring Cash back to life. Reese Witherspoon makes a formidable partner. Throughout the movie the interplay between them is thrilling to see. The romantic story of Johnny Cash and June Carter seems cut for Hollywood and certainly rubs of on these fine actors. Both Joaquin and Reese sing themselves in this movie, a daring choice that works out fine. Although the voice of Phoenix takes some getting used to his deliverance, timbre and timing often come awfully close to the real deal sparing us the discomfort seeing an actor lip singing  to a dead man's voice. Witherspoon actually sings better than June.

The way the story is told is somewhat disappointing. Johnny Cash was in life a dark and brooding personality, a man of extremes. Often torn between self-destruction and the need for redemption, consumed by drugs and his past, battling between his love for June and his hatred for himself, attracted to both sin and purity, Cash was not an easy man by any means. This ongoing conflict fails to surface in its totality throughout the movie. It almost seems as if Mangold took away some of the sharpest edges to make the movie more easy on us. This takes away some of the depth the movie could have had. Mangold chooses to focus on the romance and the music. Cash's fascination with scripture and self-destruction or his youth trauma remain safely in the background of this love story. Although this does deliver an entertaining movie it's not the definite bio-pic it could have been.",1145836800,2,2589,4.7959641255605385

I also came away thinking that Witherspoon deserved her Oscar but Phoenix was robbed of his, because they both put in Oscar-winning performances.  If I could have changed this movie in any way, however, I would have focussed a bit less on the romance between Carter and Cash (it more or less was the whole movie) and told the whole story of Cash more -- we get some insight into his childhood and why he was such prone to self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, but the rise from door-to-door salesman to megastar was glossed over.

This story is about a  young punkish Cash...the one with a drug problem, emotion problems and groweing up problem. He is the  rebel with a  musdical cause. Phoenix does not just play the younger Cash, he dominates the vocals as  well. You can debate if he should have won the Oscar.  I am sorry he didn't but it still is an amazing performance. If you like this, catch him in the  movie Buffallo Soldiers or Ladder 49.

And now to the Lady Reese, she is June Carter Cash.  Like Sissy Specek, Ms Witherspoon transformed into June. Her Oscar winning performance was earned and not handed out lightly. Now she can do Legally Blonde three without worrying!

X-Files's Robert Patrick is great as Cash's Father ray. He is a stand out in this emsemble cast

Do I think this film is a classic? NO, far from it.

 However this film is a great piece of  bio filmmaking in the cinema of reality with such films like Ray, Capote, Miracles, and the Great Escape

The movie is about the relationship between Cash and Carter, up to the moment they get married. It's a good movie, a good story about two people who were alive.

I was thinking about this the other night as my son watched Revenge of the Sith on DVD for the umpteenth time. As much as I love the fighting scenes in all the Star Wars Prequels, the movies do have a few flaws--and one glaring deficiency.

Home.

Or at least a sense of home.

We all like the idea of Home. We long for Home--especially those of us who never will know the feeling (at least on this side of eternity). That's why we watch TV shows like Cheers or (God forbid) Friends. It is also why the first three Star Wars movies so completely eclipse the prequels...

The Milenium Falcon is Home.

In this movie the road/touring/stage is Home. It is a powerful Home. As messed up as their lives are at the moment, one cannot help but be attracted to Johnny and June as they sit in a roadside diner and comiserate.

There are a lot of good things about this movie: pacing, acting, great cast--but this movie is something special because it nails its sense of Home.

Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect John, with his black attire and deep, soulful singing voice. His acting really makes you love and pity the poor man, even when he's hit rock bottom. I think he should have gotten just as much praise as Reese Witherspoon did.

Speaking of Reese, her Oscar as well as other awards were well deserved. You can't help but fall in love with the sassy little June Carter, and the relationship between the two breaks your heart and makes you cheer all at the same time.

The music, the acting, and the story are all worth a look (and listen). Solid movie for a Saturday afternoon that will really move you.",1145232000,5,871,4.331288343558282

In my opinion Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of June Carter is spectacular and very deserving of the Oscar she won for it; to me her performance helps make the movie as powerful as it is. Not to downplay the performance of Joaquin Phoenix because he was also very captivating and gave an incredible performance.

1607901,4,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" joins such stand-out musical biopics as ""Ray"" and ""Coal Miner's Daughter."" Despite a creditable job as Cash by Joaquin Phoenix, I don't think he reaches the heights that either Jamie Foxx does as Ray Charles or Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn (if you like country music and have never seen ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" watch that before ""Walk the Line""). That's probably because the real Johnny Cash just plain had a quirky inimitable voice, one impossible to get exactly right.

Phoenix does a good job, though, and is even better at giving the character emotional depth than at singing (he's a very persuasive drug addict!). Witherspoon, for her part, is terrific at June Carter; her singing is surprisingly good, and she brings the right sass to the role. I was also impressed with Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife. Some of the other parts just didn't get fleshed out enough for the actors to take hold; for example, Dallas Roberts as the producer who first recorded Cash at Sun Records just isn't given space to expand his interpretation of this interesting character.

I watched the deleted scenes and wished that many of the subplots could have been developed more fully, but of course the film had to keep its focus, which is on the love story. I'm not really sorry about that, though, because the love story was a lot of fun.",1145232000,,1347,4.752136752136752
1607902,5,B00005JO1R,"I think that ""Walk the Line"" is less a biopic about Johnny Cash than it is a love story, and the most touching and believable one I've seen since ""Brokeback Mountain"". Joaquin Phoenix, whose deep, sad eyes have added emotional depth even to comedies like ""Parenthood"" and ""To Die For"", plays Johnny Cash as a passionate, intuitive artist, a hopeless romantic and a wounded, sometimes self-destructive soul. To his first wife, he's an irresponsible dreamer who's off chasing rainbows leaving her stuck with the everyday responsibilities of raising their children. So it's no wonder he finds himself smitten by June Carter, who radiates down-to-earth charm and maternal kindness. Now that I've finally seen this film, I can totally understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her performance. She plays June Carter as a complicated woman; sweet and tough, humble and charismatic, passionate and moral. After seeing ""Brokeback Mountain"" I asked myself why it was that the most believable love stories are always the sad ones. ""Walk the Line"" offers a convincing love story with a happy ending.

But boy does he do a good job portraying a drug addict.  I like watching movies that take place in the past, and thinking about how my grandparents lived through those times.  From that perspective, the sets and wardrobe were wonderful.

I've seen Brokeback, Crash, and Walk the Line... and though they all had their merits I strongly feel Walk the Line should have been nominated for Best Picture, and should have won.  It is the best of the three, in my opinion.",1145232000,,807,4.666666666666667
1607904,5,B00005JO1R,"This movie is a wonderful story because it is strong on every component:

1.) Historic/Biographical Content: It gives you little dates and locations at various scenes so you can follow along and know what happens in which year. (very helpful). It also shows the death of his older brother, which causes him to suffer emotional heartache forever. It shows him singing in Folsom, which is my favorite scene. It shows him being addicted to, and overcoming, drugs. It shows him proposing to June several times. It shows lots of TRUE-TO-LIFE events in Johnny Cash's life.

2.) The Music: I have to say this is the BEST aspect of the movie. Not only did Reese and Joaquin actually sing all songs in the movie, they also played the instruments. Their voices and talents are phenomenal! They hit EVERY note, EVERY time...no errors. Go pick up the soundtrack!

3.) The Romance: You can tell, early in their friendship, that June and Johnny are attracted to one another. They cannot be together because of Johnny's wife and June's recent divorce. You can still see in the way they act, though, that they really do care for one another. I was sooo moved when they finally had sex. It was so sweet. Then, to see June help Johnny through his drug problems...that was the nicest aspect of their relationship, I think. In the end, when June finally accepts his proposal on stage and they kiss...I cried so hard.

4.) Appropriateness: While this film has some drug usage and language, I still found it appropriate for the entire family. There is no violence (with the exception of Johnny's outburst early in the film, backstage). There was no nudity. (They had sex, but it cuts from them kissing to them laying in bed the next morning.) While the film may not be appropriate for younger audiences...I would say anyone over the age of 11 or 12 could watch it with their parents and enjoy it.

Witherspoon and Phoenix did their own singing during the movie and sometimes you would swear Johnny Cash's spirit was singing through Phoenix. The movie begins with Cash as a young boy and shows the hardship he endured during the Great Depression and the struggle he had with his Dad. He goes into the Air Force, returns, marries, meets Sam Phillips (the record producer of Elvis Presley and other great musicians) and the rest is history. I watched it twice and if they had an award for the best picture to come along in the last decade this movie for me would be the one and I would give it 10 stars.",1145232000,,861,4.477707006369426
1607906,5,B00005JO1R,"Synthesized music, MTV and ""American Idol"" made music more of a visual package and experience.  In the 1960s and early '70s, the quality of a voice and a haunting melody created an intimate feeling between the vocalist and listener.  Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Patsy Cline or Sinatra could stand solo on a stage, clutchi a guitar or hold a mike and mesmerize audiences.  That's talent, raw, pure and clear.  Cash's low, melodious and soulful voice can raise goosebumps on the flesh.

As far as the film's concerned, the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon dazzle.  Phoenix is a marvel, capturing the essence of Cash's intensity, ambition and pain.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman was extraordinary in ""Capote"" too, and it's a tie as to who deserved the Oscar in 2005.  The comparisons to ""Ray"" are understandable, I suppose, but if one were to remove Jamie Foxx's performance from ""Ray,"" the movie would deflate fast.  Somehow, all the performances in ""Walk the Line"" seem credible, real, not as Hollywood-coated.

In ""Walk the Line,"" the chemistry between June Carter and Johnny Cash snaps and sizzles.  She's wary but attracted, aware she's made her own marital mistakes and reluctant to plunge into another ill-fated relationship.  He's always admired her from afar and has followed her Carter Family career.  When they meet backstage, he's immediately physically captivated.  But the surface appeal goes deeper.  June is undeniably female, favoring dangling earrings, heels and dresses, but she's grounded, smart and confident.  He also finds out, she won't tolerate a boor.

Certainly, there's the element that June carries qualities of his beloved older brother, the one who was tragically killed.  His older brother acted as a sane, gentle buffer, helping to soften a childhood of backbreaking labor and a harsh father.

Considering Phoenix played a calculating, spoiled emperor's son in ""Gladiator,"" he's spectacular as Johnny Cash.  As for Witherspoon, she had me at hello, or the moment her dress caught in his guitar strap.  She's got real dimension, flexing her acting muscles as an anal-ambitious wunderkind in ""Election"" and elevating the traditional ditzy blonde in ""Legally Blonde.""  Her intelligence and perceptiveness shine through.

When I watch male-female relationships on screen, I prefer seeing a balance of power.  I like seeing partnerships.  Sure, Johnny Cash was the icon, June didn't have his baritone voice or charisma.  Seldom are partnerships an identical match of talent and skills.  But she was his spiritual and intellectual equal, and over the years, he had to earn her trust and respect. Partnerships are more than physical attraction, they're enduring and flexible, strong enough to withstand the stressors and heartaches of everyday life.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are perfect fits for Johnny Cash and June Carter.  Their chemistry together in the movie is flawless.  Surely Joaquin Phoenix must have been Johnny Cash in a past life.

1607908,4,B00005JO1R,"There's a lot of powerhouse acting talent in the Johnny Cash biopic WALK THE LINE.  It's also quite accurate despite giving in now and then to the temptation to toss in hindsight, as when young touring semi-star Johnny is urged to start doing drugs because Elvis does.

Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Withersoon deliver the performances of their careers as Johnny and touring partner/soulmate/eventual partner/mate June Carter.  The feel of the period is wonderful and Robert Patrick is in top form as Johnny's humble but wise Arkansas father. Director James Mangold does fine and the two top stars sing the numbers themselves and do superbly.  Of course they aren't Johnny and June, but they are mighty close and they certainly have the gestures, body language, and mannerisms to go along with the voice.

Despite all these obvious plaudits, the film has two weaknesses as a bipic and both are the fault of the script.  First, although others have noted that there's not a lot about Cash's childhood and USAF time in the film, it is more disturbing that it just sort of ends. Johnny and June get married and we're told they lived happily ever after for their last 35 years.  I could have used more about what was over half of the hero's adult life, after all.

Second flaw was that the film didn't make me care about Johnny Cash.  If you already are a fan that may not matter but most viewers will not have been.  To them, Cash is portrayed as an indolent youth, a slacker in the airforce, a crummy husband and father, a pill-popping adulterer, etc.  Let's just say that although the portrayal was accurate, it might have been more sympathetic.

Still, this shouldn't take too much away from a fine and well-crafter film.  By all means get it.

The DVD is fine quality and you may want to order a soundtrack, too.",1145145600,,1814,4.663522012578617
1607969,5,B00005JO1R,"Let me start by saying that I have never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash and that my taste in music runs to Classical, so I am not a likely target for this movie.  However, I want to tell you that I liked it very much.  The movie portrays Cash as a very complex freight train of talent and emotion that is on some very loose and greased tracks ready to careen off a precipice at any moment.  The Cash in the movie had a certain kind of strength on stage, but off stage was something more like a black hole of emotional needs.  Of course, some would say that someone who needs all that approbation on stage is likely going to keep need it when the curtain falls and the lights are off.

Joaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job of pulling of this man's very unique look and sound and facial expressions.  But it is more than a simple imitation or even ""channeling"" Cash as so many have said.  You can look at the actor's face and tell what Cash is feeling and trying to put into thoughts and when he fails to find the right thoughts, he erupts in frustration.  Just a superb job of acting and a tribute to Cash.

Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job in making Cash's first wife sympathetic, understandable, and yet never quite a victim.  We understand why the marriage broke down and why it started badly with different expectations from two very different people.  However, Cash's vast emotional needs and charisma seems to have drawn her in, but the pressures and storms that come with the huge fame Cash gained are not compatible with the kind of domesticity Vivian wanted.

The person that Cash finally met, wanted, and needed as June Carter.  She had her own baggage coming from ""Country Music Royalty"" and a couple of bad marriages.  However, she seems to have had greater intellectual clarity and was probably smarter than Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance that wins our sympathy and helps focus our own attitudes towards the storms in Cash's life at any given moment in the film.

Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne add just the right touches as Cash's parents Ray and Carrie Cash.  Patrick has to provide the foundation for Cash's emotional insecurity and Lynne the music for him to cling to for emotional sustenance.

This is a much better movie than I expected and I am glad that they left things complex and mixed rather than trying to turn this into a moralizing or cautionary story - though there are moral issues and cautionary lessons to draw aplenty.

I thought ""He's already so great, why would they undermine his life and let Hollywood ruin it with their stupid plotlines?"" But, being an avid fan, I had to go see it anyway.

I was blown away! No one could have played the most dedicated couple in the world better than Joaquin and Reese, they had such an understanding of each other and chemistry like I have never seen. Joaquin resembles Johnny so much, the hair on my back stood when I heard him sing because it sounded so close to the character. At first I thought the two actors had used voice recordings for those parts, but was shocked when I found out they sang everything themselves! I truely hand it to both of them, they made this movie what it is. Even if you don't really like Johnny Cash, you'll love this because it's not just a sappy love story, it's a story of strength and, like I mentioned earlier, dedication. They weren't just a couple of kids in love, they were two people who understood each other completely and going against everything they believe in, found themselves together.

1607971,5,B00005JO1R,"My introduction to Johnny Cash's music was when I was eight years old. My father started collecting his albums (8-tracks actually) and whenever we were on the road he'd pop one in and we'd listen to I Walk The Line or Ring Of Fire or Folsom Prison Blues; those were the main ones anyway. My dad wasn't a big music fan back then - he was extremely selective - but Cash was his exception. Not knowing what Johnny's music was all about, I really didn't give much thought as to why my father should or shouldn't like the singer (""He sings real good, doesn't he Dad?"" ""Yes he does""). This might seem more like a family reminiscence on my part but humor me for just one more minute.

My father was pretty conservative: he paid his taxes on time without question, was a Marine, believed in the death penalty, enjoyed any kind of sports, and coached in a Pop-Warner football league.

Fast forward to this movie, Walk The Line, and I have to wonder why my father felt so strongly for this man's music. Johnny Cash was anything but conservative. Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash - from his humble beginnings on an Arkansas farm to his nearly fatal brush with amphetamine addiction - shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him. He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock-a-billy sounds that were just emerging onto the airwaves. Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best-selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).

So what was it about Johnny Cash that pulled my dad into his fandom?

Well, this movie shows us. Johnny Cash's voice (""Like a freight train coming `round a bend but sharp as a razor"") is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role. It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip-sync any of the songs, but sung them all himself. And although Johnny Cash's voice was a bit coarser and deeper, Mr. Phoenix should be congratulated for his singing talent. He amazed me.

The shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Who could've guessed that this Legally Blonde comedic talent could act so dramatically? Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip-syncing ... just as Joaquin had.

But I do have two complaints. First, I didn't much care for the ending. I felt it was abrupt and tried too hard to tie everything up into a nice ""family package"" in just a few minutes. Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).

Still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry. I'm sure my dad loved it, too.",1145059200,,3133,4.624100719424461

1607973,4,B00005JO1R,"Before seeing Walk the Line, I new very little about Johhny Cash. Before it was released in theaters, I knew almost nothing at all. I had heard some of his songs and was more than familiar with his name, but I had no concept of the impact he had on music and on so many lives.

The movie touches briefly on Johnny Cash's childhood, enough to paint the picture of a few events and relationships that would shape his life forever. The film next follows Johnny on tour, at the beginning of his career, as he played shows with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and a young Miss June Carter. They travel from city to city delighting audiences, playing shows, having a good time, and for some of them, maybe even falling in love.

Johnny Cash had more talent than he knew what to do with. But he also had skeletons in his closet and without June Carter, his story would have been one of what could have been, rather than what actually was, one of the greatest careers music has produced. June Carter, despite being the object of Johhny's affection for many years prior to their marriage, played a very valuable role in his life. Among so many other things, June Carter was Johnny Cash's guardian angel. She saved him from his own demons and inspired him to continue his greatness.

Before I even begin to comment on the acting, I need to mention something important. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own ""stunt work,"" if you will. They sang each song featured in the movie. It is truly an impressive thing they did in lending their singing voices and not just their faces to Johnny Cash and June Carter. I have read that Reese Witherspoon was not a very good match vocally to June Carter, but that should not take away from what she did. Joaquin Phoenix's voice was incredible. I thought he did an amazing job sounding like Mr. Cash.

From an acting standpoint I feel that there were two breakthrough performances in Walk the Line. I will start with Reese Witherspoon, whose career has been full of light comedies and naive characters. I have not brought myself to watch many of her earlier movies because they do not appeal to me. I hope that is about to change. Your secret is no longer safe, Reese; we now know that you are an impressive presence on screen. She is not just another pretty face, though she certainly is that. Her performance, which earned her an Academy Award, was full of strength and passion. She did humor, drama, and love and she did each one well.

Joaquin Phoenix and I have had many creative differences in the past. Well, I do not know him personally and have never actually met the man, but I refer to the roles he has played. From seeing him as male support during the majority of his career, if you had asked me if I ever thought he could play lead, I would have said no. And I would have been wrong. Joaquin Phoenix played the lead, nay, he owned the lead in Walk the Line. He still showed signs of the actor I have not liked in the past, but managed to still captivate me. Maybe it was his likeness to Johnny Cash's voice as he sang that overshadowed the rest of the performance, but I doubt it. I think he has come a long way. I am sure he has worked very hard to get to where he is now, with one Academy Award nomination under his belt. It has paid off.

Walk the Line is a movie with two great performances about two great performers. And I can tell you that you will not be the first to rush out and buy Johnny Cash albums after seeing the movie, or even the soundtrack which features the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.

I've been spoiled by movies like ""Ray"" where the actor actually has you believing he is Ray Charles. In that respect this movie is a little disappointing - Joaquin Phoenix does not look like Johnny Cash and does not sing like Johnny Cash so it was hard to believe this was a Johnny Cash bio movie. Of course the movie is totally saved by the incredible acting of Reese Witherspoon making this a very enjoyable journey through the trials and tribulations of the life of Johnny Cash.

1607977,5,B00005JO1R,Walk the Line (Widescreen Edition)~ Joaquin Phoenix is such a good movie that I am in earnest left speechless. Witherspoon is truly astounding in her role as June Carter and Phoenix is just grand in his portrayal of the man in black. This is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen period and it ranks up their with favorites such as The English Patient and Restoration. The singing (yes they do sing live) is almost to good to be true and Phoenix has been able not just to portray Johnny Cash. He has emulated everything about him and sometimes you forget that you are watching a movie and you start to think that you are seeing something real. The same is true with Witherspoons portrayal of June Carter and one can safely bet that she is an A list actor and will not be doing anymore movies like legally blond 2 anymore.,1144540800,,837,4.371794871794871
1607978,4,B00005JO1R,"For the most part, Walk the Line is simply a standard-to-good biopic, but the performances -- especially by Reese Witherspoon as June Carter -- elevate it to another level.

The film is a lot of fun for fans of classic rock and roll. Playing ""spot the future icon"" is a lot of fun when, say, Elvis is recording his demo song (one that few music fans would immediately recognize) or offering young Johnny Cash some uppers, in a moment of dubious historical reality, but great foreshadowing for the King of Rock and Roll.

Likewise, while the music isn't quite as good as the originals -- sometimes dramatically not as good -- it's credible enough and a lot of fun to listen to.

The film's heart, though, is Witherspoon, who conveys with a glance knowing Joaquin Phoenix's Cash for years, not the months the film took to make, and who subtly portrays a woman older than herself without relying on ridiculous special effects makeup or dialogue cues. Her portrayal of ""the other woman"" agonizing over her place in Cash's marriage is believable and touching. I suspect her days of films like Legally Blonde II are behind her.

A great deal of fun and strongly recommended for fans of Reese Witherspoon or classic country or rock and roll music.",1144540800,,1240,4.700460829493087

1608029,4,B00005JO1R,"Walk The Line shows the legendary singer, Johnny Cash, during his impressive career. This movie will keep you entertained from start to finish and will only make you want to see it again and again, it's that good. With stars like Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon portraying Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter, this movie is filled with powerhouse performances.

Walk The Line is unique and entertaining because it has all the singers actually sing their own songs instead of editing Cash's own voice into the movie. Reese Witherspoon took singing lessons and really shines in some music scenes as she sings for audiences in the movies. Pheonix shows he can sing too and gets the crowds going so well you can't help but tap your foot along with the music.

The acting is great also, as every character adds their bit into the movie to make you feel as if you were witnessing Cash's life when he was still a young man. Some great scenes have him starting to sing for a record company and sing about his problems with the air force and his lifestyles.

The movie starts off with Cash as a young man back in Arkansas who is noticed for his unique voice and how he sang about different topics that normally would create controversy and disbelief with people. His life takes a turn for stardom as he takes a tour around the country and meets up with June Carter, who he later starts a relationshp with.

Reese Witherspoon was absolutely wonderful as a young woman who was great to every fan who talked to her and went out of her way to start a conversation with anyone who asked for an autograph from her. She and Cash had a rocky relationship as they both fall for each other, become disgusted with each other as Cash's drug problem gets out of control, and eventually agree to marry one another in a great scene where Cash proposes on stage in a show in Canada.

It's great seeing how Cash became famous for his singing, and we also see greats he is travelling with such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley. I also found the scenes with Cash dressing up all in black and his performance inside the prison the best scene of them all, with Cash taking his hat off to the inmates who have to drink horrid, brown looking water.

This is one movie you need to see to understand how great it really is. Phoenix and Witherspoon are fantastic, the singing is wonderful, and the entertainment is off the charts.

1608030,4,B00005JO1R,"From his early days in Arkansas to traveling the highways as a singing sensation to falling in love with fellow entertainer June Carter, the movie ""Walk the Line"" told the triumphs and tragedies of the early life of the legendary Johnny Cash.  Whether you're a diehard fan of Cash and his music or a movie enthusiast, this movie will keep you intrigued and entertained.

""Walk the Line"" starts off by introducing us to a young J.R. Cash (Ridge Canipe) who lives with his family on a farm in Arkansas.  J.R. has a fondness for music (often listening to the family's radio) and is especially close to his brother Jack (Lucas Till).  However, J.R. takes the brunt of his father's (Robert Patrick) anger when Jack is killed in a sawmill accident, an occurrence that would haunt Cash.

Several years later, an older Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix) leaves the family's home, enters the Air Force and finds himself stationed in Germany.  His love for music continues as Johnny buys himself a guitar and starts writing the lyrics to what would become one of his biggest hit songs, ""Folsom Prison Blues"".

After his stint in the Air Force, his music career seems to be put on hold when he settles down, marries Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and tries his hand at being a door-to-door salesman.  However, an audition with Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records opens the door to a life (and lifestyle) that he hadn't imagined.

Johnny soon finds himself traveling long, arduous tours with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), a member of the Carter family who Johnny had long been infatuated with.  In an ill-fated attempt to balance the grueling schedule, an increasingly volatile family life and his secret love for June, Johnny turns to amphetamines and soon finds himself hooked.  Johnny hits rock bottom and runs the risk of losing everything until June and her family intervene in an effort to save him.  The rest, as they say, is music history.

I had high expectations for this movie because of the buzz surrounding it.  I wasn't disappointed.  Even though we know the story's ending, it's interesting to see part of the journey that gets us there.  A good biographical picture gets moviegoers interested enough to make them want to know more about the person being portrayed on the screen even after the film stops rolling and I think ""Walk the Line"" does that.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were wonderful as Johnny Cash and June Carter and were convincing in their performances, even doing their own singing.  You really feel their emotions come through in each scene they're featured in.  Although they didn't have a lot of screen time, some of the scenes with the supporting cast such as Jerry Lee Lewis' antics and Ezra (Dan Beene) and  Mother Maybelle Carter's (Sandra Ellis Lafferty) run in with Johnny's pill supplier (actually, his run in with them) were fun to watch as well.  Another performance to mention is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash.  His cold-heartedness and criticizing nature seemed to motivate Johnny to prove that he was the better man.

While I know that the film was supposed to focus on Johnny and June, I thought some added scenes explaining how he met Vivian would have been nice.  We're told about her when he calls her on the phone from Germany.  When we see her for the first time, they're already married.  It also would have been interesting to see a few more scenes between Johnny and his dad, but the scene at the end did bring a degree of closure to their situation.

""Walk the Line"" is definitely one of the best biopic films to come out of Hollywood in recent years.  You'll find yourself intrigued with the early days of ""the man in black"".",1144281600,3,3761,4.762345679012346
1608031,5,B00005JO1R,"It was a toss up for me between Capote and Walk the Line. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are so good in this film. They are truly amazing. The music, the period design, the story were just fantastic. Riveting and heartbreaking story about the power of true love.",1144281600,2,269,4.625
1608032,4,B00005JO1R,"As many others have stated here, ""Walk the Line"" is a wonderful film.  The music is fantastic, and the fact that Phoenix and Witherspoon sing the songs themselves is quite impressive.  It quickly becomes clear that Witherspoon fully earned her Oscar.

I was highly disappointed with the special features on the 2-disc edition.  I rented it, and ended up buying the more simplified 1-disc version since the movie/commentary is really the only thing worth watching anyway.  The ""making of"" featurette doesn't really talk about the filmmaking or casting or music recording at all, which I had really looked forward to finding out more about.  Instead, it was a rehashing of scenes from the movie with reminiscences from people who knew Johnny and June.  It's not as effective when you hear people who knew them talk about the love between Johnny and June, and then they show a picture of Phoenix and Witherspoon from the movie instead of the real thing.  The special features almost felt like promotional reels for the film.  I think I only saw a few photos of the real Johnny and June in all of the featurettes.  I don't really feel like I learned anything new from the featurettes that I didn't already pick up from the movie itself.

Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and the music.  I would recommend saving 10 bucks and getting just the movie though.  The simple 1-disc edition still has commentary and deleted scenes.  The special features are the only reason I gave this four stars instead of five.",1144195200,6,1506,4.742307692307692

It started with Cash losing his brother in a mill accident, and never gaining approval from his father.  Later it was drugs and alcohol.  It was amazing to see how much June helped him chase off the demons, literally, of these habits and move on to make great country western music.  The film has a great feel to it as it brings across the era in spectacular color and vision.  Cash was the man in black, but not without going through a lot of bad times to get there.  Some great scenes from his famous Folsom Prison Blues concert that took place inside Folsom prison.  The film is more than just about the specific time in Cashs life, it's about how some people can be a positive influence if you let them in, and give them a chance.

1608036,4,B00005JO1R,"This was a lovely romantic story based upon Johnny Cash's life beginning as a poor farmers son listening to the radio, and the series of events leading to his being a major star and married to his childhood idol June Carter.  Of particular enjoyment were the scenes early in his career where Cash was touring and partying with Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Elvis.

As seems inevitable in a biopic about a major star, we see the ravages of touring and drugs, how they almost ruin his life and then he is able, with the support of June Carter and her family, to kick the habit.  The contrast between June's loving family and Cash's hard unforgiving father makes you see how a lack of love in childhood can cause severe damage to an adult and result in self-destructive behaviors.

""I Walk the Line"" is more of a story of how an emotionally damaged man repairs his psyche enough to have decent relationships rather than the development of a star and his calling as a musician.

Joacquin Phoenix does a nice job but the real star of the film is  Reese Witherspoon whose beauty and talented portrayal of June Carter steal the show.  Definitely a must see!",1144022400,3,1153,4.541062801932367

1608088,5,B00005JO1R,"Upfront declaration:
1) I am a fan of Johnny Cash's music as much as I'll ever be a 'fan' of anything.
2) I can't stand biopics.

So I went to see this flick following the proddings of my offspring and wife, in the company of said wife.

I want to say a few things that I think need to be added, because they were mostly missing from other reviews.

The not-so-good-things:

The beginning was rather 'bitsy'. Flashbacks to 'youth', meant to serve as exposition and also 'explanation' are very difficult to do, I know. I think they could have been done better. Not necessarily longer or shorter but just 'different'. They had a perfunctory air, like something that had to be gotten over and done with, but was done without much heart. The transition from the thump-thump-thump of the intro to Cash's youth was jarring, instead of stimulating or creating expectancy. It took me some time to recover my bearings and get 'with it' again--and I WAS 'with it' right at the beginning. The sense of things not working persisted for a good half hour into the movie.

The second thing was the down-grading of the importance of Cash's first family. Did they ever matter to him at all? According to this script and implementation, not really. I wonder of this doing the situation justice. It certainly demeans Cash's character. Was he really that shallow, indifferent, selfish? I don't know. Who does? But the real question is, did the film makers intend that effect and impression? If so, they succeeded. If not, they screwed up badly.

Now for the good things, which is much more fun:

I don't think June Carter was quite the cute--though troubled and tough--little munchkin that Witherspoon portrays her as. But I think she and Phoenix managed to pull off very convincingly the love story that is at the heart of all of this. For it's not really about the music, nor about Cash's social conscience or whatever. It's just about a guy who grew up in troubled circumstances, and like all of us had to carry around the baggage through his life. He also had a 'calling', which not so many people have; or if they do they hardly ever listen.

He did listen though and went to some lengths to follow it; and got sucked into the maelstrom of money and fame and all that jazz. Matters were made worse by the fact that a) his family, wife and parents alike, didn't really understand what a 'calling' is and how it can drive someone to do very odd things indeed, and b) it just so happened that the one woman marked against his name in the great scheme of life and the universe and everything was basically unattainable--and yet right across the room.

Turns out, however, that, when all was said and done, the 'calling' and its fulfillment was empty without the one thing that really mattered. Still, it's not fair to say that June's rejection of him led Cash into drugs and near-ruin. He made some bad decisions, and part of her rejection was occasioned by those, and that in turn made him make more bad decisions. But that's just life. Thing is, in the end--and in reality, too, which makes a nice change--they did get together; and when she died, after 35 years together, he followed her less than half a year later. It's a very touching and romantic story, made even more touching because it isn't made up.

The music? What about the music? Well, this is where the film just 'worked'; because the music paced it admirably and was put to very good use to convey emotion where the bracketing narrative sometimes failed. In fact I wish there had been more music and less narrative. The scope of the Cash/Carter repertoire is so wide that they could have added several judiciously-chosen songs and put the point across even more succinctly, especially in the duets.

Phoenix and Witherspoon on the stage are dynamite. I know they're not really singers, and they're just imitating/representing a couple of people that actually lived--but there were some moments where I thought ""wow; they're actually better than the originals"". I know that's heresy, but what the heck! And isn't it really the ultimate tribute to Cash and Carter when the actors go out of their way to make it even better? I know they went to music boot-camp and all that, but so what? Everybody can learn things. Few will take what they've learned and make THIS out of it.

I noted the down-playing of the religious angle of the Cash persona. That was a good decision, though I suspect it was taken more for Hollyweirdesque reasons--meaning venal motives--than out of a sense of story-telling integrity. In any case, there was just enough to point it out, but then just as quickly look away and focus on more important things. Way I see this--from an essentially atheist perspective--I think a person is better off, generally speaking, 'finding Jesus' than doing drugs. His chances of being a decent human being are definitely greater. If finding religion--next to finding June--is what it took to set Johnny Cash's life in order, that's fine with me.

4/5 stars overall because of the occasionally-confused story line
5/5 for Phoenix and Witherspoon

1608089,3,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix does as good a job as anyone could do portraying the Man in Black. Too bad the movie wasn't a little better. I think Jon Stewart called this ""Ray with white people"" at the Oscars, and that's about right. The music scenes are great, the standard self-destructive rock star stuff is sort of a drag... bottles are broken, a sink is pulled out of the wall, drugs are abused... yawn. Also I wasn't buying the love story between Johnny and June -- thankfully their real life relationship was deeper than this.

1608090,4,B00005JO1R,"By itself, ""Walk the Line"" is a 5-star infection of a movie that I just can't ""quit."" The day I saw this movie in the theatre, I bought the soundtrack to the film; and later, while on vacation with my husband, dragged him to a local theatre so we could see it together (he thanked me later).

""Walk the Line"" is anything I could want in a movie--a blockbuster flick with an indie-film groove; downhome, oldtime C&W with the grittiness of rock-n-roll; a classic love story as well as a painful retelling of rebirth and redemption...and kick-ass music. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give top-notch acting AND singing performances that are heartfelt and reverent; both actors do justice to the subject matter and the late musicians they portray. Post-Oscars, I heard a couple people unfairly badmouth Witherspoon for earning her Oscar; but IMO the award was well-deserved--Witherspoon's honest performance of the complex and spirited June Carter Cash was nothing short of magnificent.

After investing in the 2-disc collector's edition for its bonus materials, I was a bit disappointed. Although I loved watching the deleted scenes, audio commentary version, and full musical performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon, I thought the two ""featurettes"" chronicling the lives of Johnny and June Cash to be somewhat lacking. To be sure, the admiration of the friends and family commenting within the featurettes was genuine and heartening. However, making a featurette comprised almost solely of clips from the film itself with overdubs and cuts to friends and family left a lot to be desired--did Johnny and June never get their pictures taken or their performances recorded?

As a movie, ""Walk the Line"" is a gem. It is poignant that this film's exec. producer is Johnny and June Cash's son, John Carter Cash. I can only guess that his mom and dad would've been very proud of their son's tribute to them. However, consider saving some bucks and just get the ""regular"" DVD; the special edition DVD is no big shakes.",1143849600,8,2015,5.026946107784431
1608091,2,B00005JO1R,"I thought that there was something wrong with this movie.  Johnny Cash appears one-dimensional, and the story kept jumping from one incident to another.  If they kept a bit of continuity, (like showing how he gained acceptance in his field rather than cut from him making his first record in a country store to being a spectacularly famous singer with a spectacular following) it would more cogent and more enjoyable.

I remember Johnny and June Cash as people with more substance than this movie shows.  The movie was a poor attempt to capitalize on the memories of these two performers who are still in the minds of much of their public.",1143763200,10,639,4.72972972972973
1608092,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" was a fantastic film based on everyone's favorite bad ass, one John R. Cash.  The biopic focuses on Johnny's life from his humble beginnings working the fields in Arkansas through his immortal concert at Folsom Prison.  Johnny's life and story is the kind of stuff that begs to be made into a film.  Essentially its a story about a country singer who got involved with drugs but became clean.  But at the same time it is so much more than that.  It is a love story, it is a redemption story, it is a story about being a human being.  Here was a man who walked the dark road to dance with the devil himself but was able to come out clean and stronger than ever before.  Johnny's story is so great because it is a wonderfully human story about making mistakes and finding those people in life who help to rise you above yourself and your weaknesses.  Johnny Cash is a perfect example of an everyman.  He had his trials by fire, but he became a man who touched so many lives with his straight ahead, no frills, honest music.  That is what makes the film so great.  Yes many will notice that the film rarely aspires to high art, i.e. groundbreaking cinematography, and such, but that is what gives it its charm.  Much like Johnny's songs this film doesn't need the frills to be a great film, and that is what makes both it and Johnny's music so artful.  Buy the dvd, watch the film, and see that sometimes real life stories of love, romance, and redemption can be more powerful then any work of fiction.  nuff said",1143676800,5,1526,4.3462897526501765

During the performace scenes the music is so loud you could wake the neighbors, but when there is dialogue it's almost inaudible in several areas.  The only time I can recall when the audio was spot on was when he first sang for the man at the record label, believe me you will grow just as tired of adjusting and readjusting the volume when you view this DVD.

1608095,2,B00005JO1R,"I will start by saying that I am not a great fan of country music or the music of Johnny Cash. If you love one or both you will probably enjoy the film. If you want to see a great movie..the two stars hold. The reason I viewed it was because I like a well done biography regardless of the genre or subject matter. Unfortunately, I found that this one lacks any major points of interest. Like hundreds of other famous men, Cash had trouble with women and much of it was his own fault. He got invovled with drugs, recovered, and then married the girl of his dreams. A nice love story but hardly enough to engage an audience for two hours. The movie could have done more with the theme. Both he and Loretta made a huge impact on country music. This movie failed to reflect on that larger context beyond showing screaming fans. In the end it is simply a love story that we have all seen before. To make matters worse, this movie doesn't just feature cuts from his songs, it is largely made up of performances interspersed with acting. While they do use a few songs to illustrate how Johnny and Loretta related on stage, this device seems just that...a device to allow us to hear his music while not completely forgetting about acting. In the end what sticks most strongly in my mind is how similar the melody of the songs were with the same foot thumping bass line at the core of each one. When songs go on so long that you wonder where the movie went you begin to think that the writer ran out of material. Personally, I had to struggle to stay awake for the second half.",1143590400,,1568,4.282828282828283

  IMAGE:

Now, here's the interesting thing about the picture quality.  Despite this movie being an important and popular release, the transfer is not quite up to Fox's usual high standards.  The colors are vibrant, but they can also look oversaturated at times and maybe a tad too bright for ultimate realism; the overall delineation is good but not great; the clarity is occasionally veiled by a touch of grain; and the general appearance is sometimes rough.  Put it another way; Fox's transfers are usually much cleaner,clearer, sharper and more natural than this.  Then again, maybe its just my eyes.  The picture quality is certainly adequate.

Sound:

The sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1, the Dolby Digital 5.1 that I listened to being more than adequate for the occasion.  Indeed, it's excellent.  There is a very wide front-channel stero spread; terrific surround sound in the rear channels, immensely helpful in reproducing the ambient noises of live concerts; strong bass and transient response, and almost ideal clarity for midrange dialouge.  The result is an enjoyable listening experience all the way around.

Special Features:

On the single-disc edition that I watched, the major bous items are an audio commentary by co-writer and diretor James Mangold. On the main commentary, Mangold tells us the movie is about a man who got a second chance in life because he was blessed enough to be visited by an angel in the form of a really incredibly great woman.  The commentary is fun to watch.

There are also ten deleted scenes.  They last about twenty-three minutes and they are in anamorphic widescreeen.

Last, is a theatrical trailer and a soundtrack promo.

We all have our faults, and the Cash legacy will live on not only through their music, but through their beautiful children as well. I hope everyone who watched the movie also has the opportunity to listen to the interviews of the Cash family memories as told from the heart by their daughters.

1608133,5,B00005JO1R,"Let me start off by saying Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in the business. He made us hate him in Gladiator, love him in Ladder 49, and now hate him and love him in Walk the Line.

This is a great movie, that in my opinion, should have taken a lot more academy awards than it did. Following the life of Johnny Cash from when he was a kid to when he's a succesful country/rock artist, this movie did a good job portraying Johnny Cash as he was. June Carter fan as a kid, June Carter lover as an adult, and a drug addict for a good portion of his life. Who can forget the scene when Joaquin Phoenix improvised and ripped the sink out of his wall in a rage? And who can forget when June Carter's parents finally tried to sober Johnny up? The drug dealer comes to Johnny's front door and gets a sawed off shotgun barrel jammed into his chest by June's father. Then June's mother, dressed in Sunday best, comes out of the house with HER sawed off shotgun, trained on the drug dealer.

Bottom Line: Joaquin and Reese do a phenomenal job singing Cash and Carter's songs, and also do a phenomenal job playing their parts. I was never a Cash fan before I saw this movie, but now I'm tempted to pick up his live record from Folsom prison. 5 star film, no question about it.",1143331200,3,1274,4.17479674796748
1608134,5,B00005JO1R,"OK...you caught me. I'm a Johnny Cash fan and this review may be biased. So shoot me. But thankfully enough no bias is needed to enjoy this film. The story of Johnny Cash is one of inspiration and perseverance. Walk The Line documents Johnny Cash's life from early childhood (with the death of his brother, Jack) to the time he proposes to June Carter on stage, even though she had refused him so many time already up to that point. It's a rag to riches story and in inspirational picture that shows as long as you have passion for something, then anything is possible.

From his childhood wordplay, to his buying of his first guitar while he was away in the army in Germany, through his audition for a little label called Sun Records, to the point where he first sees the woman he has been waiting for all of his life, this movie delivers on every aspect. The script is solid and well-written for each role. The dialog and actions are true to life form for the body language and slang of the time. The recreation of the various venues and concerts are realistic and natural. James Mangold has created, by far, his best film.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have something that is rarely found in cinema. They have acting chemistry. Both of them perform practically without flaw. Reese looks absolutely adorable with the dark-brown hair of June Carter, and has no problem playing her sassy, silly, and caring personality. In various moments of the film. Joaquin Phoenix resembles Johnny Cash to an eerie level of realism. In fact, not only Reese and Joaquin did a great job, but the whole cast from supporting roles to extras did a fantastic job. Though Joaquin Phoenix could have easily won the Oscar for best actor instead of Heath Ledger.

One of my favorite parts of the film are the music scenes. The performances are not dubbed over by the actual voices of Johnny Cash and June Carter, but redone by the respected actors. It gives the film a taste of uniqueness and creativity. Surprisingly, both Phoenix and Witherspoon have a wonderful voice, and Phoenix had to learn the guitar from scratch for the role. To tell you the truth, I prefer Reese Witherspoon's voice compared to some of June Carter's work. Another element of the film that stood out was the editing. Done through music montages and split-screen progressions, the time spans that pass in this movie are done so in a way that let's the audience know what is going on in that period, but also not leaving the character in the dark about the present.

Walk The Line is the best film of the year. Simple as that. The acting and directing carry this movie to the far reaches of the heart. Even though the camera work is nothing out of the ordinary, all of the other aspects are enough to keep the film afloat. This film truly drawls the audiences compassion and care for Johnny and his ever dieing devotion to the sassy June Carter. Johnny Cash may have not been the most handsome man or the most courageous, but what he lacks physically is made up for with one of the strongest hearts in all of music and a soul that sings to all of humanity.

When you notice family member (in this case John the son of Cash and June as executive producer in the credits) that should be warning enough. What you will not be prepared for is one of the worst scripts in recent memory that made it into a major motion picture.

Leads Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon each excell in their roles, with respect to both their acting and their singing.  Phoenix's performance in particular was reminiscent of Val Kilmer's portrayal of Jim Morrison in the movie The Doors, so fully does he embody his character.

This movie was well-done overall, but some of the deleted scenes, while brief, so enhanced the film that I wonder at the rationale which caused them to be left out of the theatrical release.  Specifically, several scenes expand on the relationships amongst the main characters, from showing Cash's first encounters with Jerry Lee Lewis and the Carter family to providing glimpses into tender moments between Cash and his first wife.  Perhaps the producers were reluctant to add to the movie's already lengthy running time (135 minutes), but honestly, the story was so engaging that I never once looked at the clock.

1608192,4,B00005JO1R,"I saw Walk the Line in the theater on Thanksgiving Day. Although I am not a country music fan, I have always had a certain amount of respect for Johnny Cash because he was his own man, a true original, and this persona came across in his songs. This element comes through nicely in Walk the Line.

Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance in the role of Cash, even getting the accent right. Reese Witherspoon, in the role of June Carter, also gives an electrifying performance. The two are dynamite together on the screen.

Most of the film focuses on Cash's musical career from its beginnings in 1955 to his concert at Folsom State Prison in 1969. As other reviewers have pointed out, we are only given a very short account of Johnny's childhood and teenage years - but from what we are presented with, Cash had to struggle and scrap for everything he earned.

What I found most interested about Walk the Line is that it does not attempt to glorify, romanticize, or heroify Johnny Cash in any way. Instead, the director presents with all aspects of the country music legend's life: the good, the bad, and the ugly. ""The man in black"" was a dedicated musician and songwriter, and was totally loyal to his fans...but his musical career encompassed so much of his life that his marriage suffered, and he eventually turned to alcohol and drugs to cope with mounting pressure.

The concert scenes with Phoenix and Witherspoon on stage will make you crank your volume to the max. Personally, I think Phoenix deserved Best Actor over George Clooney at this year's Oscars for his performance in this movie. I actually walked away with a greater appreciation for country-western music and a newfound respect for Johnny Cash's musical legacy after watching Walk the Line.",1142899200,8,1769,4.771241830065359
1608193,4,B00005JO1R,"I am not a country music fan nor was I familiar with the music of Johnny and June Carter Cash. What I am is a Reese Witherspoon fan.

So, that is what got me interested in seeing this film (not to mention the constant publicity both before and during the Oscars). Now I am Joaquin Phoenix fan as well after seeing this great movie. The acting is phenomenal and I can't say enough about the singing. Both performances are awesome. It is hard to believe that these two actors portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter are not already professional musicians.

I enjoyed the movie although grew weary of all the scenes of Johnny as a drug addict. Surely he had some redeeming qualities; why else would the adorable June fall in love with him? I am afraid that now the image I have of this man in black is of a man high on drugs and I know there was more to him than that. Granted, this movie only covers his childhood to 1968.

1608194,5,B00005JO1R,"Hearing so many positive and glowing reviews of ""Walk the Line"" I looked forward to seeing it, once it was on DVD.  I worried that like many films you anticipate watching, I would be let down.  Happily, I was not disappointed in the least.

While ""Line"" is the story of Johnny Cash, it is more than just that - - it's really the story of a love affair that not only took ten years to culminate but according to Cash himself, saved his life.

Despite the wealth of material to choose from in Cash's life, the film spans basically from 1955 to 1968.  There are several brief scenes from Cash's childhood, establishing his family structure (or lack thereof), his early love and interest in music and a tragic family accident that led to years of guilt for Cash.  The film then flashes forward to Cash being in the Air Force and writing songs, then being married to his first wife, Vivian and attempting to make a go as a salesman.  As we all know, Cash was no salesman, unless it came to his music.  On a fluke, he sings for Sam Phillips and before you know it, he has a record out and is quickly touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and June Carter.

In my opinion, these are the best parts of the film.  Cash's interaction with the lovely and honest June, and being part of the tour circuit.

Of course, with all the adulation and success comes the downfalls -- the alcohol, the drugs and the women.  And Cash falls prey to all of them.  His family life suffers as he is away from home touring, and when he is home, he is preoccupied and getting his fix.  Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the lack of development with the storyline on his first marriage.  Obviously his boozing, pill popping and womanizing take a toll on his marriage -- but that avenue isn't really explored.  Cash and Vivian do seem to fight and disagree a lot and eventually they do divorce -- with Vivian taking their children.

June Carter, meanwhile, has had her own bumpy love life.  She has divorced her first husband, much to the consternation of some of the strict religiously zealous citizens who feel that marriage should be forever.  She married for a second time, but not happily.  She has two young daughters to raise and she is in love with Johnny Cash.

As Cash spirals downward into drug and alcohol abuse, June is there to help him pick up the pieces.  She stays by his side and helps him kick his dependency.

The movie ends with Cash's live performance at Folsom Prison, before those inmates who can relate to his music, and a performance in Ontario, where Cash proposes to June on stage.

This film could have gotten bogged down in detail, or just not clicked.  Biopics are very hard to do - - particularly with such a public figure, beloved by so many.  But this film succeeds and succeeds so well mainly because of the performances.

Joaquin Phoenix simply amazed me as Johnny Cash.  I forgot I was watching Mr. Phoenix as Johnny Cash, he transformed himself INTO Johnny Cash.  You could see the pain his eyes, speaking of his brother, his guilt, his dependency on the drugs and alcohol and his deep love for June.

Reese Witherspoon is perfection as June Carter Cash -- her physical loveliness would be enough to make someone fall in love with her, but her strength and heart shine through.

Phoenix and Witherspoon's singing together is phenomenal.  I am not a country fan, nor did I know much about Johnny Cash before this film, but I found myself tapping my foot along to the music and looking forward to the next musical number.  Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon shamed themselves in any way by doing their own singing - - they both looked completely natural playing their respective instruments and singing along with each other.

This film was an absolute delight and makes clearly evident why both Phoenix and Witherspoon were nominated for Best Acting honors.  You will end the film not only with Cash's songs in your head, but with the deep love he shared with June in your heart.

Definitely one of the best films of 2005.  Highly recommended.",1142899200,3,4063,4.53920220082531
1608195,5,B00005JO1R,"In general, biographical films tend to be troublesome: how do you do justice to ANYONE's life in 120 minutes?  Much less a musical legend with a life full of such intrigue and drama that it could fill several years worth of the National Enquirer, front to back?

First of all I must admit that I am not generally a fan of many things that are front and center in this film, those being country music, musicals, Jonny Cash, and heavily biographical films in which we're shown the rich artist as a poor, lil child, only to turn into a major singer later in life, complete with tough breaks in love and all sorts of drug and alcohol problems. That said, if you're looking at this film on paper, that's pretty much what you get, but if you actually watch the movie, you'll get a lot more out of it, mainly due to the film's two lead actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both of whom take over their real-life counterparts' personas entirely, and deliver two of the most resonant performances of the year.

I found myself utterly swept away with this gritty yet utterly enchanting story of Jonny Cash and the story of the great love that grew between country stars Cash and June Carter during the early years of Cash's career. ""Walk the Line"" is the result of intense collaboration between director James Mangold, co-writer Gill Dennis, Johnny Cash, and June Carter Cash. Though both Cashes died in 2003, they oversaw the script's development for seven years. Mangold and Cash's insistence that the film's stars would actually sing paid off. Witherspoon's singing (as June) is lovely, and Phoenix's contains the raw energy and soul that defined Cash's sound. Even as a child on a cotton farm in Depression-era Arkansas, Cash shows a strong interest in music, escaping from his no-frills life and strict father (Robert Patrick) through hymns and listening to the radio. When his brother dies in a freak accident, young Johnny feels responsible, and worries that he will never live up to his brother's goodness.

The film follows Cash through his first marriage with Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin) and into the early stages of his touring career alongside such musicians as Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and most importantly, June Carter. As Cash's success grows, so does his relationship with drugs, alcohol, and Carter, putting a strain upon his family life. From his initial audition with Sam Phillips of Sun Records on through his legendary 1968 concert at Folsom Prison, Cash is transformed from a hesitant singer riddled with demons to a man whose uniquely bold style would make music history.

At the film's opening, Cash (Phoenix) sits alone in a side room fingering a saw blade, then flashes back to his childhood on a cotton farm. His overbearing father (Robert Patrick) blames him for his older brother's accidental death, which may or may not have been prevented had Cash been working with him instead of fishing. The severity of Ray Cash's ""it should have been you, J.R."" mentality will stay with Johnny Cash always, creeping into his songs and his medicine cabinet.

The story is simple enough, and at times conventional. Cash's relationship with his first wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), is relegated to the standard ""we can't make rent,"" and, ""I'm jealous of those screaming girls on the tour"" kind of strife, which no doubt happened, but wasn't there something deeper?

Nonetheless, Mangold creates savory moments that not only subvert convention, but yield new insight. Cash's first session with Sam Phillips at Sun Records (a bit part played like a big one by Dallas Roberts) - when Phillips preaches to Cash and his dopey-eyed backup gospel singers about the kind of songs that really save people (the kind that sell records) - is one of the more sheerly fun scenes in film this year; second, perhaps, to the theology lesson delivered by Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne).

These moments - what it's like in the car with Cash, Lewis and gang - are the sort of things easily left out of a biography, and they are the kind of details without which a biography seems devoid of the life it's trying to explain. Witherspoon becomes the unlikely anchor of this film - the peg around which all of its honesty is tethered. We see it in the way she responds to a store clerk lecturing Carter on the moral implications of divorce, and in the way she instantly recovers, on the surface, because she has to buoy Cash.

""Walk the Line"" never attempts to paint a full picture of Cash's prolific career, but instead focuses on the passions that drove his music and on the woman who gave him strength. With magical performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix, a haunting and inspiring American romance is brought beautifully to life. All together now, ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaw, now wasn't that the cutest little love story?""

""Walk the Line"" leaves approximately 35 years of Cash's life untouched, and has gaps in much of the time it does cover. This is a good thing. Many films about legendary figures forget that legends make their own records. These films try to cover too much ground and suggest that all of life's conflicts should be resolved, or reach an end. But the best ones leave an open door, recognizing that legends - the dark parts, happy parts, and all - never stop revealing themselves.",1142899200,2,5323,4.8203723986856515
1608196,5,B00005JO1R,"If you want the whole life story of Johnny Cash...this is not the movie for you.  This is basically the love story between Johnny and June Carter Cash.  Although there are scenes outside their relationship for example the accident involving Johnny's brother and how it shapes his relationship with his Mom and Dad, and also features to some degree his relationship with his ex wife...this is really the story of Johnny and June up until his concert at Folsom Prison.  Personally I wish they could have expanded past that...but it would have made the movie way too long.

Johnny Cash has a very distinctive look and sound that is hard to duplicate.  For the most part Joaquin did the best job to try to emulate him....is he perfect?  No...but, who could be?  Reese Witherspoon...was she the perfect June Carter Cash?  No but, she brought a vulnerability to the character and I can't imagine enjoying anyone else in the part.  The two brought a lot of chemistry to their scenes together that made them believable.",1142899200,,1011,4.764367816091954

Now, although I think Reese is an adorable actress, I do not think she deserved the Oscar and I'll tell you why.  I saw Transamerica at the theatre last weekend and was completely blown away by Felicity Huffman's performance.  I was absolutly mesmerized by her believable portrayal of a transexual.  Don't take my word, rent or buy this movie (if you haven't already seen it).

Back to ""Walk the Line"" - I saw Johnny Cash in a small venue about 15 years ago.  It was an amazing show and I felt honored to be in the audience.  Although it wasn't as good as the real thing, I think Joaquin did a very good job.  Hats off!",1142812800,,760,4.410071942446043

They are amazingly good performers who between the two of them have built up a remarkable resume of performances and top it off with this film.  Both of them deserved to win Academy Awards for the job they did and the fact that Phoenix didn't is only because P.S. Hoffman also did such a remarkable job.

Anyway, I was never a big Cash fan (had nothing against him, just didn't know much about him or his music) but this film really made you appreciate him and June Carter as people and as performers. For a thought-provoking, touching evening of film, rent this movie.",1142812800,,616,4.590909090909091

The most impressive factor to me (as a recording engineer and producer) was Joaquin Phoenix's ability to emulate the vocal characteristics of Johnny Cash.  He came just about as close as an actor could be expected to come.  Reese Witherspoon also does a very respectable job of carrying a tune in this movie.

The life being chronicled in this movie is certainly an interesting one, yet it is certainly not a story we haven't seen before.  It bears countless similarities to other ""rock star"" movies we've all seen in the past.  They come from humble beginnings, take a chance and make it big, crumble under the pressure of the fame, turn to drugs and become dependant - and eventually get cleaned up by the few people who give a damn.  Sometimes this kind of story doesn't have a happy ending.  Luckliy for Johnny Cash and all of his fans, this one did.

The movie is engaging.  Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderful together.

Joaquin Phoenix convincingly shows the intense desire for Carter that Cash feels, though he must mask his emotions over many years and each other's marriages.

The portrayal of his childhood scars is simplistic, but as one angle on a complex life, the film succeeds as a romantic biopic.  One feels the true story of Cash's life, is both less thrilling and less mundane at the same time.

Often genuinely thrilling (Folsom performance), Phoenix et al received well deserved attention for superb performances all around.",1142726400,,683,4.913043478260869

You really felt like you were back in the good ol' days of Nashville.

The lead performances are good. Oscar worthy?  I'm not sold on that.  I like Witherspoon, but thought Phoenix's performance was stronger. I found their vocal performances to be well done.  Not a forced imitation of Carter or Cash, but more of an homage.

Maybe it was the editing - but the story didn't flow well. There wasn't a good portrayal as to why June and John were attracted to each other.  And Cash's detox program was the shortest shown in any movie or Lifetime special.  We are also to infer that some healing went on w/Johnny and his father - but considering most of the conflict in the movie is based on their relationship, I don't think it would have been too much to play that out a bit.

The extras are barely that. Commentary and languages. The deleted scenes, as with most dvds, add nothing and were ripe for cutting from the movie in the first place.",1142640000,4,934,4.421052631578948

I find myself replaying the DVD just so I can listen to the music becuase 'Times A'wastin' and 'I've got stripes' are not on the soundtrack CD.

A comment from an earlier reviewer mentioned the obvious wigs that Reese wore in the move.  It made me remember that in the late 60's and early seventies we all wore wigs and some were pretty tacky. I think we called them falls and we added them to our own hair to make it look fuller.

I thought Ginnifer Goodwin did a great job too. I did not see her role as a bitter wife.  She, like many other women in those days, was very frustrated, often pregnant and had few choices.  She was caught in a bad space with no where to go. The story took place before the women's movement took off in the seventies.",1142640000,,912,4.261627906976744

The story of Johnny Cash is in some ways a typical one-abusive father, beaten down child, escapes into the music world, tries to be a family man but the rigors of the road lead him into drugs and alcohol. Typical but for Cash's incredible luck in having run into June Carter, who, with her family, forces him to get off the pills. Witherspoon in this movie goes from being the silly, cute ""Legally Blond""  type to becoming the most loyal of friends, but tough too. Apparently both Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing-Witherspoon is no singer, and I thought her first number was just a poor dubbing job, but this didn't ruin it for me for a second.

1608308,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" follows the life of country/rock star Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from the genesis of his career in the mid-1950s until his marriage to June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in 1968, as Cash develops his sound, struggles with his own frailties, and rock'n'roll emerges in Memphis against a bland landscape of American music. The film focuses on Cash's personal life and how his music expressed his conflicted personality, but we also see the legendary musicians of Sun Studios under producer Sam Philips: Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, with whom Johnny Cash and Tennessee Three, as well as June Carter, toured the nation. Glimpses of the those musicians evoke the a lifestyle in the early days of touring, when there were no buses, no roadies, and no sleep. I didn't find the film especially sympathetic to Cash's first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), but it is sensitive to June Carter's delicate position as a divorced woman very much in the public eye when divorce was not always acceptable.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon couldn't be better as off-and-on-again lovers Cash and Carter. Phoenix conveys Johnny Cash's eternal struggle to live up his ideals, his darkness, his love of music, and love for June Carter. Reese Witherspoon expresses Carter's commitment to working hard and pleasing her fans, sometimes through difficult circumstances and personal pain. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing, having trained for 3 months under the tutelage of music producer T-Bone Burnett, and they sound great. Musician roles in the film were cast with musicians, which lends some welcome authenticity. Writer and director James Mangold, along with co-writer Gill Dennis, have done a great job of packing a lot of material from the most turbulent period in Johnny Cash's life -and one of the most exciting times in American music- into an entertaining and insightful film. The events of the film are based on Johnny Cash's 2 autobiographies, and he and June Carter had the opportunity to approve the actors who portray them before they passed away in 2003.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer, a soundtrack promotional spot, and an audio commentary by director and co-writer James Mangold. Mangold's commentary is both personal and informative. He provides tidbits of additional historical information, talks about preparing for the film, details of filming, and the film's structure, as well as his conversations with Johnny Cash, his intentions and inspirations, and the film's themes as they reflect Cash's life and personality.

What I really was expecting was more about Johnny's music career and more about his life in general.  The movie basically ends around 1970, no mention at all of Johnny and June's life after that.

I think Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Cash was very good.  I had reservations about his singing at first, but I guess he was portraying Johnny in his early days as not having as strong of a voice.

Reese Witherspoon was her usual adorable self, but I don't think she pulled off June Carter that well.  She really didn't look or sound that much like June.  I will say that Witherspoon has an excellent singing voice (I would almost expect her to release an album), it just isn't June's unique voice.

Reese Witherspoon deserved her Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of June Carter, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is of equal caliber. It's a great movie, definitely worth seeing.

The reason for this posting is to tell people that the Collector's Edition is a waste of money. The bonus features in this more expensive version are a huge disappointment. After watching the film you would hope to see a revealing documentary about the real people. However, there's no footage of Johnny or June singing, no interviews with them, nothing but a couple of still photos. The three bland featurettes are just a series of clips from the film and some interviews where people ""talk about"" Johnny and June. What a wasted opportunity.

1608312,4,B00005JO1R,"Two superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make the bio-pic of Johnny Cash `Walk the Line' a highly engaging and absorbing drama about him and his love June Carter. Without two leads, the film might have become a shallow melodrama about music and love that you have seen on screen many times before. As it is, in spite of the weak supporting roles and several mistakes that betray the not-so-sure hand of the director James Mangold (`Girl, Interrupted'), 'Walk the Line' is a moving story about Johnny Cash and June Carter.

Though the film is full of great Johnny Cash songs, `Walk the Line' is more about the long-time romance of a gifted musician, and like any romance with gifted musician, it is full of romance and emotional turmoil. The film begins with the tragic event that happened in the childhood of the artist (like `Ray'), but the real film starts when we meet Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, whose less restrained and moralistic attitude to life than that of his wife inevitably attract Johnny Cash.

Johnny Cash songs sometimes reveal the troubled soul of sinner or criminal with the darkly engaging lyrics. Credible acting from Joaquin Phoenix and several episodes depicted in the film explain the reason for this darker nature of his songs, but still many things are left out. While his distant father (Robert Patrick) convincingly shows the reason for the guilt-ridden mind seen in his songs and himself, supporting characters like his mother, his first wife, and his children are relegated to near ciphers. Still the strong performance from Reese Witherspoon compensates for the occasional slack in the script.

As a fan of oldies, it is good to see the legendary artists of Sun Label such as Jerry Lee Lewis or Roy Orbison again even though they are played by someone else. The director somehow thought that to cast real singers are a better idea than to cast actors, and we see Waylon Malloy Payne and Jonathan Rice as Lewis and Orbison. I know this is only a small flaw, but I wish for my favorite musicians' roles someone who really looks like them.

But essentially `Walk the Line' is a film for Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both perfectly in character as Johnny and June. It is hard not to be moved by the conclusion and the energetic soundtrack of Johnny Cash numbers with thumping guitar riff.",1142467200,2,2356,4.824257425742574
1608313,3,B00005JO1R,"The first thing that sticks out to me about this film is the audio. It's sharp, clear, excellent. If your not watching this on a decent home theatre system you are missing a whole lot. Viewing this I kept waiting for particuler events to happen that never played out. Ring of Fire was not presented as a true focalpoint of Johnny and June's relationship, just bits and pieces of another song being written. It wasn't even discussed between them in the film. Strange. Then they played it uneventfully. Mr. Phoenix had Cash's movements down well but I kept being distracted by predictability. The film is entertaining though and I learned a little more about times and places. Reese Witherspoon is finally playing a role made for her instead of those cheesy supposed comedy ""films"". Her acting had real believability and she was properly awarded. A Boy Named Sue was not used for the prison singing scenes and I'm not sure why. It was done there, has wide appeal, would capture a new audience and is just a wild song to have witnessed prisoner reaction to.

  I wanted to see Johnny Cashes spiritual road expounded upon more but the film ended rather abruptly. The Elvis scenes seemed very forgetable and cheapish. I like Johnny Cash and their was a great deal to the man, but the movie came up missing that critical essence of a very changed deeper person.

1608314,4,B00005JO1R,"WALK THE LINE, the Johnny Cash-June Carter story, is an exhilarating musical biography.  It starts in 1968 inside Folsom Prison, flashes back to Cash's childhood in the Deep South of the early 1950's, then works its way back up to 1968 and beyond.  With brilliant performances by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar nominee) and Reese Witherspoon (Oscar winner), Cash's life and music career come alive.  Both actors spent months learning how to do their own singing and guitar playing live before an audience, and it shows in the electrifying musical numbers.

Director/co-writer James Mangold filmed the movie on location in Memphis, Nashville, and Arkansas along (I think) the Mississippi River.  The 1950's and 1960's sets and costumes, from my own childhood era, are perfection and should have been Oscar-nominated if they weren't.  The film runs 135 minutes, but between the concert scenes and period re-creation, I never wanted it to end.  If WALK THE LINE has any flaw, in fact, it is that it could have lasted longer for me and didn't just put three more decades of narrative crawls against a black finale background.  I wanted more music and more of the perfect Phoenix and Witherspoon performances.

This may be one of the finest musical biographies I have ever seen.  The DVD includes a directors' commentary and 10 deleted scenes that help clarify scene and character. WALK THE LINE is a beautifully crafted labor of love movie gem.  It particularly deserved the Sound Mixing Oscar nomination for spectacular concert scenes.  The movie plays and sounds, inexplicably, way better on DVD than in a theater. It is an absolute must-see. NOTE: Made in Panavision; buy or rrent the widescreen version.

1608315,5,B00005JO1R,"Walk the Line covers the early life of J.R. Cash beginning with his childhood in 1944. We saw his dirt-poor family picking cotton, his hardened-by-a-hard-life father giving no quarter, no rest, and no approval.  Jumping to 1952, the country boy in the Air Force was stationed in Germany where he bought his first guitar. After his hitch was up, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian and moved to Memphis.  Vivian didn't share John's love of music and disapproved of him and his friends ""making a band"".  He stumbled upon Sun Records where he and his two friends recorded his first songs in 1955.  Cry, Cry, Cry and Hey, Porter debuted at #14 on the charts.

John went on tour with other up-and-coming singers who had a new sound, a new look and a new attitude, among which were Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.  Being on tour in those days did not mean having an advance crew, roadies, busses and vans: it meant a caravan of cars with the musicians and their instruments driving through the night to the next gig.  The young musicians relied on ""uppers"" to keep them going. John met June Carter at the Grand Old Opry in the late 1950s. They toured together for awhile.

The movie depicts bad behavior: enjoying the groupies spawned by the new spate of young male rock and country singers, drinking, gulping down pills, missing or messing up performances, really embarrassing stuff.  There is a scene wherein June is angrily throwing beer bottles at the guys on stage at an afternoon `rehearsal' because they were drunk-it really happened!  Sudden fame is hard for anyone to handle and Johnny Cash was no exception.

The meat of the story is how the young Johnny Cash found his own particular sound, how he nearly self-destructed and was saved, and how he and June finally came together.  Oddly enough, and fortunately for the director, all three threads of his story merged in 1968, so it was a good place to end the movie.  Walk the Line is not about the Living Legend Johnny Cash; it is about the young man trying to find his place in the world of the music he loved.

You might wonder if certain scenes really happened, or did the writers put them in for dramatic effect?  The answer is yes, most of them really happened and no, a lot of what was shown is not in their biographies.  It was still too hard to talk about when they wrote them. John and June talked freely, however, to the writers and director who wanted to make a film of his life.  Johnny told the director that if he did this movie, not to leave out the bad parts.

1608358,4,B00005JO1R,"First of all, let me say that Walk the Line is the good movie, with great acting.  Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar, and I believe Joaquin Phoenix, should have won an Oscar.

I have one problem with the movie.  I don't believe it was linear enough.  It felt choppy, like they were rushing to get all their topics in, and they never stayed with one topic long enough to go into any depth.

Now, I believe that this movie should've won best picture.  However, I believe that this movie could have been even better, if they had spent more than the standard two minutes per topic.  And then cut the scene, this resulted in a choppy picture.

I purchased the collector's edition of Walk the Line.  It includes slip case, five black-and-white postcards, the featurettes on disc two are almost better than the movie, and provide more continuity.  There are also several songs by Reese and Joaquin.  These are full songs, and not the cut up versions.

The director's commentary on disc one, and the deleted scenes give you a sense of where the director was trying to go, but didn't quite achieve.  However, I still think that this movie was good enough to win best picture.  It should have at least been nominated.",1142294400,6,1205,4.570093457943925
1608359,4,B00005JO1R,"It didn't scream with power the way ""Ray"" did last year, but this is a pretty good film.  Johnny Cash had a broodier personality than I realized, but it was because he felt incomplete without June Carter.

Much like Ray Charles, Cash was also traumatized by the death of a brother.  However, there the similarities end. In ""Ray"", it was revealed that Ray Charles loved music above all else, including his own family and the many, many women.  For Cash, his heart's desire was for one woman only: June Carter...an obsession that drove him to drug addiction.  I liked this approach to the film versus focusing on Cash's rise to fame.  This flaw makes him seem more human and less iconic.

Joaquin Phoenix is hot in this film and did a wonderful job; Reese certainly deserved this Oscar...her best role to date. Forget Vanity Fair.",1142294400,,828,4.6689655172413795
1608360,2,B00005JO1R,"This movie was pretty disappointing, and certainly not worthy of the rave reviews it seems to be getting... Now, I'm not one of those people who will write negative rants about movies or actors just because they are popular or win awards... I'm also not writing mean or snappy things just to show how clever I am or how catty I can be, but rather because I sincerely am baffled by the acclaim this film has gotten, and wanted to drop in a few comments that I hope will be helpful.

I'm writing this review as a fellow who's been listening to country music since the early '70s, who's written about it quite a bit, played it on the radio for over a decade and thought about it a lot. Johnny Cash is clearly one of country music's great iconic figures, and the story of his courtship with June Carter is a great love story.  No problem there... The trouble lies with the flatness and predictability, the blandness and utterly cliched nature of the storytelling -- everything is telegraphed from a mile away, all the characters and their relationships are thinly drawn and unremarkable, the dialogue is flat and the music fails to overpower or excite.  In short, there's little here that can overcome the difficulties presented by trying to portray such larger than life figures as the Cashes, and while there are little glimpses when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon look a little like the craggy, unglamorous Johnny and June, never for a moment do either of them project the true gravitas and solemnity of their roles.  Although there is some grand and purposeful cinematography, the film itself feels like it could just as easily have been an ABC after-school special from the '70s.  Seriously.  It's just a cinematically and intellectually weak, facile presentation, sadly unworthy of its subject.

And then there are the little things -- for example, we see June Carter writing ""Ring Of Fire"" at some unspecified time (with co-composer Merle Kilgore nowhere in sight), but we never see the payoff, which is that the song became a collossal hit for Cash in '63.  Similarly, his move from Sun Records to Columbia -- one of the biggest decisions of his entire life -- is glossed over in a split-second image as part of a breezy visual montage.  Then there's the gratuitous insertion of would-be country rebel Shooter Jennings, playing the part of his father, Waylon Jennings, in a scene where Waylon and Johnny become roommates while down-and-out in Nashville.  It's kind of a cute in-joke, son playing the father and all that, except that Shooter doesn't look much like Waylon, and he *certainly* doesn't look like Waylon did in the mid-1960s, when the scene is supposed to take place: Jennings didn't have hippie hair and a beard back then.  He just didn't.  It's lame to present him otherwise.

Finally... jeez, louise... couldn't the DVD producers even manage to spell Johnny Cash's daughter's name correctly in the subtitles????  Poor Rosanne!  Oh, well.  I guess the answer is, ""it's only a movie.""  Can't take it too seriously, right?  [2006 joesixpack at slipcue dot com]",1142208000,17,3083,4.828897338403042
1608361,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" did what ""Ray"" did with regards to bringing forth music, that not of my generation and the trials and tribulations of life while bringing that music to its fans.  I am not a big Ray Charles fan, I like his unique voice and some of his ballads were very sentimental and the movie ""Ray"" was a good adaptation of his life, as I have known it through reading and such.  However, this review is about ""Walk the Line.""  I particularly did not want to see it.  It was about country music singer which I am not a fan of and starred Mrs. Witherspoon who I thought would not be able to pull off the role.  However, I am a fan of Mr. Phoenix's work, therefore, I picked up a rental and watched it.  What I did not know is Mr. Phoenix did pretty much all the singing in the film and to even resemble Johnny Cash's voice with any kind of accuracy, like he did, is well spooky.  I mean, how many men can sing that low, in that characteristic Johnny Cash voice?  Well Phoenix nailed it, which proved again, that this actor is going to have a long career.  Not only was his singing phenomenal, but his acting as well.  Now, for Mrs. Witherspoon, the quirky blond with no real serious, dramatic roles, nailed her performance.  Now, I am wondering why ""Walk the Line"" was not nominated for best picture.  I can understand why Mr. Phoenix did not win best actor, because there were a lot of great actors there and I know that he will get his some day.  However, not nominating ""Walk the Line"" when you have movies such as ""Capote,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Good Night and Good luck (why was this film even nominated)"" and then ""Crash"" which won!  Which I thought was good, but not as good as ""Walk the Line.""  If you are not a Cash fan, like I am not, or care about the period of time that this takes place, like I wasn't particularly caring about, or a country music fan, like I definitely am not, I suggest that you see it anyway.  The acting was superb, the chemistry, the script, everything.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Drama driven films, though there was some levity from Mrs. Witherspoon, anyone who are fans of the two lead actors and anyone who can appreciate a true work of art or anyone who likes country music and Johnny Cash-Of course.  I went from regretting and wanting to get over with this movie to regretting not seeing it on the big screen.  It is a keeper, buy it.",1142208000,2,2403,4.311804008908686
1608362,4,B00005JO1R,"I remember seeing this movie and walking out of the theater thinking that that was the best female performance I had ever seen in any movie.  I was also impressed by the fact that all the actors did their own singing.  Fortunately, this is becoming more and more common in movies.  Recent examples include RAY, BEYOND THE SEA (about Bobby Darin), and Christopher Guest's hilarious mockumentary A MIGHTY WIND.

I'm not a die-hard Johnny Cash fan (although I'm a much bigger fan than I was before I saw WALK THE LINE), so if there are innaccuracies or things in the movie happening out of sequence, I wouldn't know and probably wouldn't care even if I did know.

My primary problem with the movie is that all we see of Johnny Cash are the tough years.  We don't get to see his post-marriage life with June Carter.  I would love to have seen the happy years.  But for that I suppose I'll have to read his autobiography: CASH.  But I suppose the book is always better than the movie anyway.",1142208000,2,986,4.4636871508379885
1608363,3,B00005JO1R,"This movie might have benefited by being dubbed, since there really isn't any way to get the essence of Johnny Cash's voice/music, unless he's the one doing the singing.

But, because the music in this film WAS Cash's, I enjoyed it, even though I did not enjoy Joaquin's or Reese's renditions of the songs.

And as for the acting...well, I'd like to say I understand why Reese won the Oscar for her performace, but honestly, I don't.

She was cute (but cute is her THING); other than that, I'M as much like June Carter Cash as Reese was in this movie.

Sorry, but to me, the whole film was over-hyped.",1142208000,4,601,4.4363636363636365
1608364,1,B00005JO1R,"I have come to the conclusion that this movie received the sympathy vote of the year because it is the second worst movie that I have ever seen, with ""The Flintstones"" being first.  I'm only sorry that I purchased this movie before seeing it.  I would be hard pressed to want to go to a dollar theatre to view this film; and if I had gone to the theatre to view it, I would have walked out within the first 30 minutes.

Succinctly put, this movie is awful.  The best thing about it is the ending.

At first, I thought maybe you had to be a fan of Johnny Cash's music to appreciate the film; and since he was a few decades before my time, I thought it only natural that I would feel this way.  After further contemplation, however, I realize this is not the case.  Loretta Lynn was before my time as well, but I love ""Coal Miner's Daughter.""

""Walk The Line"" lacks what it needs the most ... substance.  No one could have saved this film, not even Reese Witherspoon, who happens to be one of my favorite actresses.  On the other hand, Joaquin Phoenix has no redeeming characteristics about him whatsoever.  Succinctly stated, I hate his performance from beginning to end.  There is just nothing to like about him.

Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching this piece of puff.  If you have to succumb to the ""hype,"" do yourself a favor and rent it or borrow it from a friend.  I have a friend who wants to borrow it, but I feel compelled to apologize in advance before loaning it because it happens to be among the worst films ever!!!",1142208000,11,1546,4.319444444444445

The acting is great but what struck me was the musical excellence and all around stage performance. Phoenix is Cash and Reese is June Carter! The duet 'Time's A Wastin' is pure magic! I've been listening to Johnny Cash's music my whole life and I honestly thought the music and vocals was Cash's original versions rather than the actual singing voices of the leads. Phoenix had all of Johnny's moves and expressions as well. Both Reese and Joaquin nailed it. But having said that, for me, seeing Reese solo on stage with autoharp giving an unbelievably geniune and moving rendition of the Carter family classic, ""Wildwood Flower"" (and hearing she basically had to learn to sing for the part), is worth the price of the DVD. I can understand why she got the Oscar for Best Actress.",1142121600,3,938,4.725609756097561

The film is extraordinarily entertaining from beginning to end and the musical sequences are very well done. Both actors deserve a lot of credit for doing the singing and making the performance sequences realistic. No doubt Witherspoon deserved her Oscar and Phoenix was equally deserving in a tough field.

Having seen Capote and this I think it would be a close call but I'd have given the award to Phoenix.

Overall this is an uplifting story about a love between two people who were obvious soulmates and survived in an environment that makes long term marriages a challenge at best. Very enjoyable film.",1142121600,,843,4.929577464788732

Reese Witherspoon, is a charming, perky, sassy and pretty June and while I certainly agree that her performance is Oscar noteworthy, I feel it should have gone to Joaquin instead if they were going to choose one over the other.

It also shows his strength in surviving it all and turning his life around.  The movie was very interesting to me because Cash was played so often by my father on Sunday mornings when I was growing up (we didn't go to church much).  Cash's voice was truly unique and the lead actor and actress both did an excellent job of relating the story and bringing back to life what it must've been like for these southern country stars in the 1950s.  I was disappointed in the special features for this film, especially the lack of two or three music videos and which would've been almost expected for a DVD like this.  However, whenever I find myself thinking about a film the morning after I saw it, well, these days that's really saying something.  The movie should hit home with viewers on many levels and get a fella to thinking about his own life.  It is once again time to dust off those old CDs and rediscover that sound...

1608432,5,B00005JO1R,"To start out, I've gotta say...Reese Witherspoon definitely deserved the award she won for Best Actress this year, and even though Joaquin Phoenix didn't win the award for Best Actor, he certainly did a great job himself.

Probably the most stunning part of the movie was that Witherspoon and Phoenix both learned to sing and play instruments. Neither of them had had any previous knowledge of music or singing, yet the result was stunning. While Phoenix does not sound exactly like Johnny Cash, and Witherspoon does not sound exactly like June Carter, they definitely evoke the feelings and do the songs justice.

One of the great parts about this movie was that neither of them were imitating their characters, they were simply emulating them. Certainly, Joaquin Phoenix does not REALLY look that much like Johnny Cash, but in the movie he portrays him so well that you begin to think he IS Johnny Cash. The fact that that element is present in this movie makes it a cut above your normal fare.",1141948800,4,996,4.784883720930233
1608433,4,B00005JO1R,"Alright, let's cut to the end of the page: there is literally nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before. In fact, it's pretty much the same thing as ""Ray"" from the previous year, only with more subdued and less hammy performances. This movie was meant to be Oscar bait, and Reese Witherspoon did indeed walk away with a statuette, so mission accomplished. That being said...

Walk the Line is the Johnny Cash biopic, and within the quite codified conventions of the biopic (especially musical biopic) genre, it is quite good, at times, even excellent. If you didn't see this movie in the theaters, you missed quite a show, because the musical numbers here are something that most home audio systems won't be able to replicate. The director, James Mangold, does an outstanding job of staging these sequences, and it is easy to see how Cash's music electrified listeners at the time. It even delivered a sizable jolt to me, and I generally dislike country music (most music, for that matter). Joaquin Phoenix and Witherspoon are magnificent on stage, I suppose that technically they are better singers than the performers they are playing. Since the music is one of the big draws, I figured I would comment separately on it and just say that this part is fantastically executed.

As for the rest of it...credit Mangold and his screenwriters for not folding in every musical biopic cliche into their movie. There's no Freudian back door that conveniently wraps up everything, as in ""Ray"", which was completely untrue as to Charles' problems in real life. There is a groaner when Witherspoon tells Cash, ""You cain't walk no line,"" after a drunken, drugged-up, all-night jam session with his band. Still, this is familiar territory for anyone who as seen a biopic or gets VH-1 on their TV. The execution is better than most, but people who come to watch a completely original story or want to find some sort of message will be disappointed.

Overall, this movie succeeds at what it tries to be, and for that, I give it 4 stars. One gripe though: even though Reese Witherspoon's Oscar was deserved, just looking at the last couple of years' worth of Oscar wins shows a pattern that anyone who is not a ""serious"" actor that plays a pop culture celebrity and does a good impersonation seems to be a shoo-in for an Oscar. I guess Jim Carrey's only mistake wasn't that he wasn't as good as the guy that won, he just picked out the wrong role--maybe a biopic about the secret inner life of David Bowie would get him some gold? Seriously, imitation can win awards, but let's tone it down, before Jamie Foxx wins Oscar #2 for ""Stevie"". Bunz singing ""Cherie Amor"". God help us.",1141948800,2,2671,4.715203426124197

Without Joaquin Witherspoon would NOT have won her Oscar!

There is another scene in the movie where he finds a cabin in the woods, and not a single mention of the fact that the night he found it, he nearly died and that was how he found God, which as most know, he was very religious at least in his later years.

Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were both outstanding and deservedly Oscar winners (or nominees as in Phoenix's case).

One thing I noticed is that Johnny Cash has a certain tone to his voice where you can tell what he sings comes from his gut (for lack of a prettier word), Joaquin Phoenix was not able to duplicate it exactly, but he had a very similar quality which was great.

1608482,3,B00005JO1R,"Yes, I was disappointed because I thought it would focus more as a biography on Johnny Cash than a sick, twisted, obsession/love story between Cash and June Carter which almost killed him and his career.

However, I will say that this is the finest acting job Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix both have done to date.  They gave excellent performances but the movie as a whole just wasn't that exciting where you'd watch it again and again.

Eventhough I'm not a big fan of country music, I was looking for the movie to give me a reason why Cash became the ICON he was, and was looking for more into why his father (played well by Robert Patrick, my favorite Terminator of Terminator 2 fame) and him had such a horrible relationship even before his brother died, and well after.  It was almost as if they portrayed CASH as a man who couldn't function partly because of his starved approval he desperately wanted from his father which obviously we know, he'd never get.

I think the director wasted a lot of time not going in depth about what it was about June Carter that made CASH basically abandon his first wife and children and go on a psychopathic trail to get her.

As far as the prison scene at Folsom, there was a lot more interaction between CASH and the inmates that was left out.  After all the Live From Folsom CD was not only his so-called comeback album, but one of the biggest lp's at that time outselling even the Beatles.

Overall, I don't blame the actors/actresses I blame the director for not utilizing them more and going more into depth about CASH's life.  It almost felt like an MTV movie.  The Two Disc set is cool and gives you extended performances of CASH and June Carter.",1141776000,6,1703,4.5

Witherspoon has always been a natural on the screen, but she truly shines in this story.  The cinematography is also fantastic, capturing light and mood in a beautiful balance.

I walked away from the movie challenged by the artistic drive of the characters, touched by the fearful acceptance of love by two hurting people, and wanting more Cash.  What about the next 35 years of their lives together?  Surely there's more rich material in this couple's history.

Truman Capote? Who was he and why do we care? Let see if Truman can sing and act.

My reflections after the credits rolled were, that the movie was good, the performances were good, the movie moved, but didn't move ME. So much of the songwriting and band relationships were cast aside, and while I do appreciate the role June Carter had in JC's life, the movie made it appear as though he did nothing but stalk her. I can also appreciate the fact that the script could only be ""so long"" but how many 3 hour gladiator/super hero/against all odds movies have we all sat through that were TOO LONG? I say this movie could have been another hour (at least)and it wouldn't have seemed like it. In fact, Johnny Cash deserved as much.

Let's just look at the script as it was written, not as someone else might have written it. Let's just consider the singing of Phoenix and Witherspoon and not make minute comparisons to Cash and Carter. In other words, when you consider this film on its own merits, as a biop and entertainment, you've got to love it. One gets a good sense of Cash's struggles with his father's rejection, his brother's early death, his frustrations with his first wife, June Carter's continuous rejection of Cash's marriage proposals, and Cash's addictions to pills and alcohol. One also is immensely entertained by the driving sound track, the great musical numbers, the early touring with Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis, and the fiesty and energetic performance of Witherspoon as a charismatic June Carter. Phoenix and Witherspoon are terrific together. Their chemistry is palpable and infectious. And although, like all commercial films, some of the facts no doubt have been bent to add drama to the story, I loved the whole thing. I just wonder why such a supposedly tough guy like Cash didn't go after his rejecting and downright ugly father. I also wonder where all his talent came from and how he got that voice and style. But one thing's for sure, he was a unique artist and his story, as portrayed in this movie, is well worth seeing, hearing, and loving",1141689600,11,1438,4.825910931174089
1608549,5,B00005JO1R,"Capitalizing on the popularity of Ray , Walk the Line also chronicles the turbulent career and life of an iconic musician, applying the same plot structure - their lives have parallel arcs and hit the same dramatic beats. Like Ray Charles, Johnny Cash struggled with substance abuse but helped beat addiction with the help from the love of a good woman. Unlike Charles, who wanted to be loved by millions, Cash became successful on his own terms, turning his back on the country music industry when they failed to support him.

Walk the Line is a fine, return to form for director James Mangold who started his career with the independent darling, Heavy and then followed it up with the star-studded crime drama, Cop Land. He peaked with the critically lauded Girl, Interrupted and then struggled to find quality material, coasting with entertaining but otherwise forgettable films like Kate and Leopold and Identity. Walk the Line is definitely a return to meatier, more substantial material.

Joaquin Phoenix is a strong actor who has been in search of the right role and has finally found it with this movie. He has been miscast in strong films (Gladiator) and been good in weak movies (Ladder 49). Walk the Line is perfectly matched with his considerable talents. It's a daunting task for any actor to play a well-known public figure and even more so for an icon like Johnny Cash. Phoenix wisely doesn't try to do an imitation of Cash, opting instead to convey the spirit of the man, capturing everything about him through the eyes.

Reese Witherspoon utilizes her adorable, plucky persona that she's cultivated for years to maximum effect as Carter, matching Phoenix's intensity and willingness to immerse herself completely in the role. Carter is the strong, moral centre on a tour filled with legendary bad boys - Cash, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. She resists the lures of the open road and constant touring - the drugs and alcohol - that Cash succumbs to and this is part of her attraction to him. It is her purity and loyalty - standing by him even when he hits absolute rock bottom -that is a large part of her appeal for him. Carter is just as stubborn as he is and sticks by him because she loves and believes in him. Phoenix and Witherspoon have great chemistry together as they play out their on again/off again romance. They compliment each other so well. Cash is wild and Carter is wholesome and it is these ying and yang qualities that they love about each other.

There is an audio commentary by co-writer/director James Mangold. He starts things off by reading the opening page of the screenplay which is a description of the opening scene to illustrate how a script is more than just dialogue and how closely what he wrote is to what we are watching. Mangold speaks eloquently about his filmmaking process, the film's themes and Cash's life, delivering a very informative track.

Also included are ten deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mangold. There is more footage of Cash's inability to be a good salesman, more of his early days as a musician in Memphis and provides a little more insight into his first wife (Goodwin), fleshing out their turbulent relationship.",1141689600,8,3202,4.80399274047187

Reese Witherspoon is a sweet, spunky actress but she didn't convince me she was June Carter, but merely ""acting the part"".  As one reviewer stated, she was like a school girl playing dress up.

While I like Reese Witherspoon in the Legally Blonde series to me she looks like a high school girl who likes to play dress-up in all of her films and this one was no exception. Johnny Cash was complex and driven by many demons as this film shows. I did not feel that the onscreen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon revealed the true nature of this great love affair.,1141689600,5,555,4.295238095238095
1608552,2,B00005JO1R,"While the acting of Phoenix is very strong, he did not convey the endearing side of Cash, and that is more the writer or directors mistake, and I must agree with J Whitney that the two actors just don't have the chemistry either. And, while the cinema realite is very internal, I think the end of the film was wanting, because Mangold chose to ignore Cash's Nickajack Cave incident, which was his lowest point and his struggle with God... and as a result, it missed Cash's epiphanic moment.

One thing Hollywood won't get is the heart of evangelical religion.

Cash took it all to the edge to show that life is a messy conflux. That is why he is loved by people of all sorts, a very rare type.

I forget who but one of the participants joked that it was ""Ray"" with white people.  That's a shame because it diminishes what an impressive work this is.  Though I'm not a fan of country music per se Johnny Cash always garnered my respect and kind of had street cred.  You had to admire Cash's uncompromising devotion to his work and how he carried his pain and personal demons with dignity.  The makers of ""Walk the Line"" were cognizant of the integrity of their subject matter and unlike ""Ray"" do not try to mimic the artist their portraying.  Instead they try to channel the spirit and essence of Cash and wholeheartedly succeed.  Joaquin Phoenix may not have the physical build or vocal intonations of Cash but he intuitively understood the essence of the man.  It doesn't take much doing to imagine the Man in Black playing out his own life on the screen.  Witherspoon equals Phoenix in her portrayal of the commonsensical June Carter.  Less is known about Carter than Cash but in Witherspoon's portrayal you can imagine how her guardian angel saved Cash from the abyss of substance abuse.

They just are not very good. An example- a special on the Folsom Prison concert- clearly one of the most important steps in Cash's career.  The special, though it has interesting excerpts of interviews from people who were there, does not have any footage or stills of the actual concert.  I found the same to be true of the other specials on the disc as well.  Lots of shots of the two stars but very little of the ""Man in Black"" himself.

Although primarily about Cash framed by the tragic consequences of his early family life, the movie centers on the love story of Cash and Carter. As Cash's music career takes off suddenly and dramatically, the lives of Carter and Cash intersect frequently to the point of doing duets together and traveling to the same shows. Captured in a time line out of synch with their own realities, their mutual affections are trapped in marriages in place long before their first meeting.  While Cash's personal life obviously languishes, Carter's also quietly self destructs over the years. In the interim, Cash's bout with pills, road schedules, guilt with his parents (a touch of daddy dearest), love for Carter and most damaging, his own family culminating in a failed marriage takes Cash to the edge of ruin.  Intermingled in this long journey are the strains of a denied love. All the music is amazing, particularly as sung by the two leads. Phoenix does not completely capture the manly roughness of Cash's voice but it is heavily masculine and pure complimenting Cash's sound. Witherspoon is surprising, particularly her singing and she plays a girlish yet strong Carter whose family is there for Cash as well, supplementing the early family support he never had.  A great film and my only critique would be to have had even more song performances.

1608611,5,B00005JO1R,"Walk The Line is a rare kind of film; it has commercial appeal, but it remains honest in portraying its main character(s).  The story follows the rise and brief fall (before rising again) of music legend Johnny Cash.  A struggling door-to-door salesman, Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) likes to play guitar and sing with his two closest pals, much to the chagrin of his wife.  One day while wandering through downtown Memphis, Johnny stumbles upon Sam Phillips' Sun recording studio, where he sees and hears Elvis Presley cutting a disc.  Johnny tracks down Mr. Phillips and convinces him to hear his band.  Phillips requires convincing, but he eventually agrees to take a chance on Cash.  Their initial record is a hit, and they find themselves on the road with Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and June Carter(Reese Witherspoon), who descends from a famous singing family.  Johnny and June have an obvious chemistry almost immediately.  This is a problem, because not only is Johnny a married father, June, also a parent, is just getting through a divorce, which in 1956 was still considered morally scandalous.

The film continues through Johnny's initial struggle with drugs and his attempts to win his father's approval, as well as his tumultous relationship with June.  The music is presented in an exciting way, thanks to Phoenix's ability to capture Cash's onstage charisma.  Phoenix and Witherspoon, both novice singers prior to the film, both do well.  Phoenix's Cash starts out rough around the edges musically, and gets more polished.  Witherspoon sounds like a natural country singer. Both actors deliver terrific performances.

1608687,4,B00005JO1R,"There was another review here that I agreed with completely. How do you TRULY tell the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter in just 2 hours. Well.... you can't. So, you take an element of their life... like, their rise to fame, or their deaths, or their romance and you tell that story.

The makers of WALK THE LINE chose to tell the story of their romance and how it came about for them to finally marry each other. Which, in my opinion, was an excellent choice because that was the thing that defined them the most. It was the thing that drove them and made them who they were.

Joaquin Phoenix captured JOHNNY CASH amazingly. Honestly, while I was watching the movie, I didn't see Joaquin Phoenix... I saw Johnny Cash. If Jamie Foxx won the Oscar in 2005 for RAY, the Joaquin should be a shoe in for 2006. He was truly amazing and should have won previously for GLADIATOR anyway.

On the same note, Reese Witherspoon may have not captured the immitation like Joaquin did, but she captured the ESSENCE, the hesitation and Love that June had for Johnny and she is equally deserving to win.

The film brings to light the uncontrollable hold that love has on a soul and captured some truly wondeful moments of devotion, friendship, loneliness and that sometimes, everyone needs a helping hand to get out of an abyss.

Not to mention, captured some truly great musical performances. Joaquin Phoenix should get an oscar for the FOLSOM PRISON scene, ALONE!

This is a true gem of a film that demonstrates that Love is like a magnet, and June and Johnny's lives were always entertwined, they just took different roads.

The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that biopics are inheritantly boring and not as interesting as we assume the persons life actually was. We see a childhood story of hardship and death... the rise to fame... the drugs... the women... the crash... the recovery... the music... huh, Johnny Cash and Ray Charles led the same life...

The life of Johnny Cash up to a certain time in the late 60s or so is well portrayed, although it's kind of depressing with Johnny's drug use, alcohol, infidelity and so forth. Overall it's an inspiring film, especially for aspiring singer/songwriters, because this film gives them hope that their music may reach a broader audience some day too. And the inspiration aspect alone is well worth watching this flick. The music is great too and as mentioned Phoenix just plays his part so very well and Reese as June Carter does also an excellent job without overplaying the role.

The photography has also been executed very well especially regarding the set details for each particular era. It's just that there are a number of slow passages and as every movie should have a beginning, a middle and an end, the ending was rather abrupt and out of the blue so to speak without a lead-in and that bothered me a bit. But overall it's an inspiring movie and well worth watching it.",1141430400,,1119,4.651515151515151
1608689,3,B00005JO1R,"Walking the Fine Line between Clever and Stupid

By Jayson Harsin

From ""the Man in Black,"" 1971: Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,

Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,

I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,

But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,

Or listened to the words that Jesus said,

About the road to happiness through love and charity,

Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,

In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,

But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,

Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

Thumbs up and down. I was thoroughly entertained by Walk the Line, James Mangold's attempt to be the first cinematic commentary on the recently deceased Johnny Cash. The acting and singing were superb. T. Bone Burnett's musical production is often mesmerizing. But the narrative arc attracts criticism, particularly the reduction of Cash's life to a quest for June Carter and a kind of Oedipal Complex with his father.

Reese Witherspoon can't easily be judged on her fidelity to June Carter's historical character unless one has access to ample clips from Carter's early career. That said, Witherspoon's acting and singing are strong in the role she plays as a coquettish country legend occasionally pestered by Christian guilt. Witherspoon's singing and HeeHaw-like sketch smarts are admirable. She has it down.

But the film's focus is of course Cash. I was in awe of Joaquin Phoenix's masterful portrayal of the Man in Black. As a fan of Cash, I have seen him live, and seen clips of him when he was younger. It was as if Phoenix had carefully studied Cash's most intricate facial mannerisms, his walk, and his speech patterns. I also applaud the cosmetic team's styling of his hair, clothes, and body into a character I never could have guessed would so remarkably resemble the legend himself.

The camera work in this film depends on a lot of close-ups which give it a melodramatic aura. It's difficult to say whether that's bad in general. Cash was a man that struggled with his demons, who stirred emotions in his music and persona. A film about Cash would be lacking if it did not include some of the powerful melodrama that was in fact his life. Close up shots also invite viewer identification with the hero.

Interestingly, these shots and the access to Cash's personal life humanize him, even explode his traditional masculine persona. He is often portrayed as weak, lacking confidence from early childhood to the film's end.

But the melodramatic devices are captive to a kind of Hollywood love story. The choice to focus on Cash's early life is highly reductive and typical of Hollywood screen formulas. In this story, two major forces seem to propel Cash's early life: a love quest for June Carter, the starlet of royal country ilk, and an Oedipal drive to conquer his father. Both drives are located in his early life. In a sense, this narrative choice makes the film a narrow psychological study.

Cash is marked by his humble cotton-picking origins, a harsh father, a close and protective older brother, and his love of early country on the radio, where his love for June Carter begins. The early loss of his brother leaves Cash forever struggling with the trauma of losing his best friend and paternal love. The hardworking but emotionally icy father is resentful that God took his eldest and ""best son."" ""You took the wrong son,"" he cries in a poignant scene that forever marks young Johnny's future. A refrain that runs through the film is ""You look like you're goin' to a funeral [,John]."" And Cash's response, ""Maybe I am"" is traced to this original event: his brother's death/funeral. Cash is forever going to his brother's funeral.

The other major force propelling Cash's life is his love for June Carter. As children, he and his brother hear the girl's beautiful voice as she sings on the radio with her famous family. There the seed of love is planted. Much of the rest of the film suggests Cash's aimless mistakes in career and marriage are a hapless wandering until he finds his fated soul mate and true love, June Carter. It bears some fairytale trappings, since when Cash gets the girl his problems appear to disappear, few as they are in the film--namely, drugs, insecurity, and oedipal hate towards his father. In Hollywood, apparently, all you need is love.

Different viewers will have other things to object to in this portrayal. Historical material of a docu-drama always invites comparisons to ""the real thing"" and accusations of infidelity to the real. While Cash is hardly portrayed as an angel, his first wife is portrayed as a 1950s uni-dimensional housewife, desiring all the dreamy accoutrements of upward mobility, ever wistfully searching for that irrecoverable Tupperware party. After weakly opposing Cash's dream to live by the sweat of his guitar, she figures out that what she really wants is a family man and the attention that any kind of spouse deserves. The story may not encourage complete sympathy with Cash in his family relations, but as hero of the film, Cash's familial misdemeanours are easily overlooked and his wife is potentially transformed into a shrewish, jealous bore. June Carter, on the other hand, is portrayed as a strong woman, caring yet determined, and able to reconcile her own choices with the judgments of others.

Reducing Cash's life to these two major forces, father and love, can be seen as the cost of generic constraints on mass-circulated films with big stars and budgets. Here one should return to Cash's ""Man in Black"" lyrics, written in 1971. Cash was not a Lee Greenwood; his was a different kind of country music, not easily appropriated by the Republican noise machine. Though he had only had brief stints in jail, he had drug and other problems and identified with those who had transgressed and been punished or who had the misfortune of growing up in cotton fields and without resources many take for granted. The film ends in 1968, and we get an on-screen script that reduces the final 35 years of Cash's life to a footnote: ""June and Johnny lived happily ever after."" Ah, the pleasure of fairy tale closure. Is that all there was to the Man in Black? No, but that's all this narrative has time for. What would Johnny say?

1608690,4,B00005JO1R,"WALK THE LINE is a well done, convincing portrait of one of country music's greatest stars.  While not a fan of Mr. Cash myself, I learned a lot more about the man via this movie.  Why it works undoubtedly is the performances given by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Having won Golden Globes for their performances, the two stars are up for Oscars this Sunday as well, and Ms. Witherspoon is a frontrunner.

Phoenix captures the essence of Cash in his physical movements, although ironically, he's probably got a better singing voice than Cash.  He evolves from the starstruck youth to a confident star, although he falls victim to alcohol and drugs.

Witherspoon doesn't quite lose her Legally Blonde persona, but as the darkhaired June Carter, she excels in evincing the emotional upheaval Cash brought into her life.

Ginnifer Goodwin as Vivian, Cash's first wife, does a fine job as she watches Cash grow further and further from his family life and into Carter's arms.  Robert Patrick is good as Cash's distant and seemingly insensitive father and country/pop singer Shelby Lynne makes a convincing Mama Cash.

While James Mangold's direction is very good, the movie itself seems a little too sanitized at times, although exposing Cash's weaknesses is commendable.  A good biopic all around.",1141344000,,1304,5.0514018691588785

1608692,5,B00005JO1R,"Johny Cash is before my time but that doesn't matter. Anyone could watch this movie without knowing anything about him and just fall in love with the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just awesome here as Johny Cash and even puts his oscar nominated performance in Gladiator to shame. I don't know what kind of expressions the real  Johny Cash made but Phoenix literly becomes someone else here almost as if he's possessed.

  Cash has a wife and a family and his dream job is to be a singer and after that happens his money is there to support his family but he isn't. Then he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and that complicates his marriage even more since he falls for June instantly. He gets June to to  sing with him which makes his wife jealous, especially when he starts hanging June's pictures all over the walls. On top of that he becomes a pill popper that washes down the pills with beer. Which gets in the way of his marriage, his dream job and keeping his friendship with his dream girl. All that might sound depressing but you'll feel uplifted and happy by the end.

  Reese Witherspoon is excellent here and I hear critics say that Philip Seymour Hoffman should win for Capote and that Reese should win best actress. I agree, she should win best actres but how could anyone say she should win and that Joaquin Phoenix shouldn't ? If you listen to the real Johny Cash and the real June Carter sing in the end credits, Phoenix sounds exactly like Johny Cash. While Witherspoon just sorta sounds like June Carter but barely. I'm not knocking her performance, she has a lovely voice and great chemestry with Phoenix period. I just don't see how you could watch this movie and walk away saying that any other actor deserves the award more than Phoenix . I'd love to see them both walk away with oscars.

I felt that the showing his of his undying love for June and his addiction to pills/alcohol was excellently portrayed. Also the tragic death of his older brother Jack, I found heartwrenching.  The acting is great, the two actors really did a great job at singing and performing Cash/Carter's classic songs.  What I loved is that they didn't try and make Cash/Carter seem perfect and their ""love story"" effortless and easy.  June is married/divorced a couple times and you see her take insults for it and how weary it makes her to love/marry Cash.  The only thing I wonder is how was Cash's first wife Viv portrayed and who did they get the information from.  Viv seemed very selfish and unsupportive and I was curious if this is how she actually was all the time, somehow I doubt it.  Still the movie really is about June and John, loving eachother and being best friends and finally overcoming everything.  It breaks my heart that John died only four months after June passed away.  Maybe you can die from a broken heart.

1608736,3,B00005JO1R,"Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts.  Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold?

Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message).  Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice.  And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.

But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic.  Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention?  That is up to the voters.  It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy.  But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies.

of the ""freight train"" sound of early, rockabilly Cash.  The

movie could almost be called ""Ray II"" b/c it follows a similiar

structure, storyline, and visual style as the Ray Charles flick. The screen writers made the interesting choice of telling Cash's story up to 1968, which overall worked, but does make the movie plod a bit with its 135 minute length (thank god they deleted a ton of scenes at that).  The performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are as captivating as the music, and overall their love story has intrigue, although it too is a bit drawn out.  Overall, I felt too much time in the heart of the movie was allocated to Cash's drug problem, which heightened the negative feel of the story. Although I realize biographical movies can spread themselves too thin by covering too many aspects/phases of the person's life, I feel this one could've

been a bit more dynamic in the approach.  Overall, the storyline was too focused on his failed marriage, pill

habit, and love for June.  I felt I didn't learn or experience as much as I could have.  However, overall I'd recommend the movie and the performances, especially for the toe-tappers out there.",1141257600,,1229,4.777251184834123

I hate Reese Witherspoon in most of her films so that kind of was bad for me too. But I decided to go see it and I was blown away. First both did their own singing and did a good job. I think it might have been top notch if they would have used John and Junes real voices but you can't complain on the out come of them doing their own. The story is also excellent and heartwarming. It has funny moments and also very sad moments. It also shows the downside of showbiz and drug addiction. But it also is inspriring in the story of June and John's love. Also Robert Patrick was excellent as Johnny's father Ray Cash and it really showed Patrick as a very good actor. The story of John and his fathers tension and then finally them declaring a truce and almost reconciling later in life was also heartwarming.

1608741,4,B00005JO1R,"If you are a long term Johnny Cash fan the movie will not impress you as to script and direction.  If you are young and don't know much about Cash's career and personal life you will love this movie and DVD set. When I read Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Johnny I somehow knew he would do a great job...I guess from his looks, mannerisms, and method-acting training. When I read Reese Witherspoon was going to play June Carter Cash, I thought it was a joke. However, Witherspoon does a good job in her part and the chemistry with Joaquin worked very well.

What really hurts this movie is the poor script, understanding this is a very difficult movie to make in the first place. However, much of the script doesn't work well and had it not been for great acting by Joaquin, and to a lesser extend Witherspoon, this movie would have been a box office bomb.

Without question Joaquin Phoenix should win his Oscar nomination for ""Performance by an actor in a leading role"" at the 78th Annual Academy Awards, Sunday, March 5, 2006, but the odds are against him.  Walk The Line is a financial success only because it was a smaller budget, large release, movie at around $31 million production cost ($60 million after marketing and distribution), and pulled in $153 million in gross revenue, at the time of this post, due to some unexpected great acting. It's nice to see the studio get it right for a change.

HAVING DINNER WITH JOHNNY CASH - 25 years ago I got the rare opportunity to join two people and have dinner with Johnny Cash. One of these people was Johnny's personal friend, and I was a tag-along. The evening with Johnny lasted about 4 hours, including after dinner drinks. Me getting to go was nothing but luck and standing in the right place at the right time.

At the time, I knew who Johnny Cash was but didn't know how large a legend he was or what an incredible person he was, until that evening. There was something about Johnny's physical size, voice, straight forward mannerism and his ""against the grain"" attitude that affected my life that night and even to this day. With Johnny there was no pretense with the man....he was who he was.  Thank God I was blessed with the opportunity to met the ""Man in Black"" in this personal setting.",1141171200,3,2255,4.512254901960785
1608742,5,B00005JO1R,"Walk the Line tells a biographical account of Johnny Cash's (Joaquin Phoenix) life up to the mid-point of his life.  However, it does not focus on his musical achievements during this time although they are a major part of his life.  Instead, the film efficiently displays the maturation of his character. In the process, the audience gets a poignant glimpse into the roots and soul of his music.  The film opens in Folsom Prison in 1968, as Johnny fingers a circle saw while thinking of his childhood.  In one long flashback, the film provides a uniquely inspiring and genuinely moving picture of his agonizing life and constant search for something better.

[Potential Spoilers Ahead For Viewers Unaware of Johnny Cash's Life]

Even though people are the sum of their experiences, there are defining moments that shape our character and persona. Johnny Cash had several defining moments that helped form his identity, which had the possibility to strengthen, or destroy him.  Walk the Line offers an opportunity for the audience to see how he responded on these moments.  It also displays the importance that other people have on an individual's existence, as Johnny would not have succeeded, or overcome his predicaments without the love and care of others.

Johnny Cash's life was everything, but easy, to which his songs are a testament.  Early on Johnny suffered the loss of his older brother, a death his father blamed on him.  He had a love hate relationship with his father, as he continuously sought his father's love by trying to please him.  However, every attempt was met with a put down.  The absence of his supportive and encouraging older brother left a large rift in his life, as it also continued to haunt him with agonizing guilt.  Besides the guilt, Johnny had to endure emotional neglect and abuse from his father who projected his own shortcomings onto him, which did not only continue to foster guilt, but also poor self-esteem and more anxiety.

In the small home, where Johnny grew up he could not escape his father's physical presence, but he sought emotional refuge in music.  The radio and his mother's soothing singing offered him in moments of unease a chance to escape in spirit and mind.  Eventually, he came of age to leave home and a not a day too late he joined the Air Force.  Johnny ended up stationed in Germany during the Korean War for which his father also ridiculed him, as he did not fight the war like other real men.  The cut downs did not cease in Johnny's adulthood.  His father upheld the same loveless relationship with Johnny.

Being an outsider, Johnny did not really fit in the military lifestyle. Again, he sought refuge in music, as a cure to his solitude. He acquired a guitar and taught himself how to handle the instrument. Soon he began to write his own material reflecting on the environment around him while letting his feelings steer his pen and fingers over the guitar strings. It is in this cerebral state where Johnny discovered peace and joy, but it also began the sanctuary where Johnny could exorcise some of his personal demons.

Despite Johnny beginning to feel freer through music, he still hampered his own growth by trying to please others such as a future father-in-law and his father.  For example, his marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), doomed from the beginning, displays his noble attempt to please others while in the process slowly killing the joy within him.  Not that Vivian was a bad person, but they were not right for each other as Johnny merely tried to make everyone else happy.  The desire to make others like him ran deep within Johnny, who acquired this personal trait in a young age by constantly trying to prove himself worthy of his father's affection.

Thus, it is easy to see how Johnny fell in love with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in their first encounter.  The upbeat beauty had a wondrous voice and a great sense of humor that brought about laughter, which must have been something Johnny dearly must have lacked during his upbringing.  She did not judge him, but shared her willingness to appreciate him and his music. June made him feel alive, worthy, and free of judgment.  Yet, Johnny could not enter her life, as he was married and she has recently got out of a bad divorce.

Despite the distance between Johnny and June, he continued to long for her.  With the years his affection only grew stronger, until he came to a crossroads of pain where he once again was forced to face his demons.  Alone, he sought alternative ways of tranquilizing the agony within through a heavy drug addiction, which began harmlessly while partying with the other great musicians such as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne).  The drugs affected him to the point where he no longer could interact or perform with others.

The many experiences and life defining moments in Johnny's life show a scarred battling fighter trying to overcome his excruciating past with love and music.  The black outfit serves a fitting symbolical value to Johnny, as a reminder of his past transgressions.  It is also here that Johnny Cash's greatness rests, as he does not pretend to be someone else.  He sings about the daily struggles that many suffer.  It provides something that people can relate to, but also find that they are not alone.  Thus, before a performance when Johnny Cash said with his unique voice, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""  It convincingly echoed within each listener - his is one of us.

There are several aspects of Walk the Line that make it a brilliant film.  First of all, James Mangold is the perfect director for the film, as his profound understanding of human psychology only seems to improve, which also heavily influenced his previous films Girl, Interrupted (1999) and Identity (2003).  Several of the actors provide solid performances, especially Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix in the leads.  However, the supporting cast also helps bring out the emotional qualities in the main characters.  One must naturally also include the music, which is superb throughout the film.  Ultimately, these and other aspects of the cinematic process deliver remarkable cinematic experiences that will not fade in memory.",1141171200,4,6243,4.869318181818182
1608743,3,B00005JO1R,Without any computer generated special effects in sight this is the rare big budget movie that succeeds due to the actors.

The acting was extremely good,  The story was interesting, and the dialog was well above average.  Pheonix has proven to be an exceptional actor.  Both Pheonix and Witherspoon gave a very convincing performance.  Before last night, I had never really paided any attention to Johnny Cash or cared one iota about his life and accomplishments.  I was surprised at what challenges life had dealt him before and during his climb to fame.  Few films have ever left me feeling enriched, but this one did!  When it was over I thought that it was terrible that Johnny and June had not lived to see this film.  I think they would have been honored by the performance and production of this movie.

So many actors and actresses impersonate real people, but with their performances, Witherspoon and Phoenix WERE the real people. I was also very pleased with the factual bases of the movie, as opposed to other biopics movies where Hollywood embellishes stories and takes liberties that are out of character or untrue to the subject. To no surprise, with T-Bone Burnett as the music head, the movie was great from a music standpoint, capturing the essence of the Cash trademark sound. Burnett has cranked out phenomenal old-style country/bluegrass soundtracks with ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" and ""Cold Mountain."" The icing on the cake is the fact that both Johnny and June had a hand in the movie before their passing in 2004, and their son, John Carter, had a lot impact in it as well. The timing was great too, because after 1968, where the movie ends, everything after that year is pretty well-known and documented about Cash and Carter, and is a part of our culture. What was captured was the little-known details and beginnings of not only Cash and Carter, but the future legends they have worked with. Overall, one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, but more can be done with special features on the DVD.

This film is a wonderfull veichle for both actors as it shows the audience a side of them few would have thought they were capable of.

Obviously a career as storied as that of the Man in Black...Mr. Johnny Cash....is difficult to cover completely in two hours however director Jame's Mangold manages to cover most bases including Johnny's infamous visit to Folsom prison, his battles with drugs and booze and of course his great romance with June Carter Cash.

Also included are some fun cameo roles by Cash contempories Elvis Presly and Jerry Lee Lewis which certainly enhance rather than detract from the story of the movie.

Perhaps most the outstanding aspect of the film is the ability of Phoenix to interpret and mimic the mannerisms and attitude of Johnny and much like Jamie Foxx's efforts in the comparable ""Ray"" he should be bequeathed with the golden statue by the good people of the Academy. Of course the drawback to these hopes is the career making performance offered up by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote which stands as his main competitor for the Oscar.",1141171200,4,1225,4.8798076923076925

Walk THE LINE 2 disc edition gave me the same reaction as the LORD OF WAR 2 disc, which was after I watched everything: ""That's it!?""... For example, on WTL there is an 11 minute 'featurette' on Cash's concert in Folsom Prison in 1968 and various recollections from Prison employees and his country singer friends.  What pictures do they show during all this? Scenes and photos from the movie! The actors portraying the real people. All the 'featurettes' are pretty much like that.  All these exclusive interviews that it mentions on the back of the DVD, these actors/musicians are barely in it, so somewhere there is more footage. If they are going to have something on the REAL Johnny Cash, why do they have to show the actors and not photos of the REAL Man in Black? Or interview/concert footage with the real Johnny Cash? How about throwing in the video for ""Hurt""? or a documentary about the man.  Disc 2 is what I call ""fluffy"", which is to say there's not much substance.  I wish I would've bought the much cheaper 1 disc because I found very little usefull or informative with Disc 2.  As far as the movie: great. terrific.  Easily one of my favorite movies.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were terrific and the singing was very good, particularily the song ""Time's a Wasting"", which curiously is not on the soundtrack CD.  The commentary by the director was good and it was nice to know that a majority of this movie is actually true.  The deleted scenes usually bore me on other movies, but these were pretty good and you'll catch John and June's real life Son(John Carter Cash) in a deleted scene as a disc jockey. I call this 'special collectors edition' the 2 disc Lazy movie makers and studios/quick price gouge DVD with mostly worthless special features edition. JARHEAD is coming out soon, and after WTL and LORD OF WAR(among others), I'm leary at the 2 different DVD versions on most movies now.

Phoenix and Witherspoon are PHENOMENAL! It would not be possible for anyone to portray Johnny and June with more accuracy, and their singing is FABULOUS!

1608821,5,B00005JO1R,"The film is most likely going to get comparisons to Ray, the biopic about Ray Charles starring Oscar winner Jamie Foxx. That's unfortunate since personally I liked this film more. Granted you might find similarities with the films but only because the legend's lives just happened to go across similar paths. Ray to me would've fell apart if it wasn't for Jamie Foxx. Walk the Line meanwhile works with everything.

After a quick clip of Folsom Prison concert, the films opens with Johnny Cash as a youngin living at home with his brother and parents. Johnny(called J.R) is out fishing while his brother works with a saw. An accident happens and his brother dies which only confirms that his father doesn't think much of him. The film then jumps to Johnny in the Air Force as he's starting to write music. He eventually starts writing and gets some popularity but the important part is he met June Carter, a divorced mother of 2. Johnny gets impulsive about his feelings which she rejects while trying to help him with his addictions.

The film wins thanks to its 2 leads with Joaquin Phoenix pulling off a great portrayal of the Men in Black while Reese Witherspoon(who hasn't really done much well known dramatic work) brings a spunk to June. While you might listen to Ray's soundtrack which largely had Jamie Foxx lip synching, Joaquin and Reese did their own singing and while it's not dead on, it's quite impressive to hear them. Listening to ""I Walk the Line"" in the film was like wow, he's quite good.

In a way it's probably one of the better examples of a real-life love story. Not big goo-goo eyes with the occasional fight, this has heartbreak, pain, anguish and everything else that goes along with. Johnny goes through so much to win her back and just as far when she rejects him. Unlike Ray which had multiple wives, here it's the affections for one while trying to deal with a less-than-happy other. We end up liking it more rather than just ""wife #3"".

There's much to like about Walk the Line, from its performances to its rock music, it's a fascinating insight to a legend's life.",1141084800,2,2098,4.646900269541779

Most notable is Reese Witherspoon's performance as June Carter, Johnny's friend and future wife. June Carter stopped Cash from destroying himself, becoming his confidant and his conscience and -in the truest sense of the phrase- the love of his life.
This was quite an ambitious role for an actress best known for her light comedy. But Witherspoon surprises us all by delivering an astounding performance.

1608902,4,B00005JO1R,"In watching WALK THE LINE I couldn't help but be struck by the parallels between Johnny Cash's background and that of my mother.  Like him, she was raised in a small Arkansas town (albeit in the hills in the northern part of the state rather than the delta area) in a somewhat rustic house and was often called upon to join her family in picking cotton.  And like Johnny Cash, in an effort to find a better life left the small town she grew up in for Memphis (though she later relocated to Little Rock).  So, this is a movie that is very much about my kind of people.

The parallels between WALK THE LINE and last year's RAY will be obvious to everyone who has seen both films.  Both deal with Southern-born musicians who struggled with drugs before eventually kicking the habit.  The romantic parallels are not so sharp, but the relative period of their success was close.  Johnny Cash was not the musical innovator that Ray Charles was, but both achieved a place close to the hearts of Americans.  Interestingly, it was Johnny Cash, the white Arkansan who achieved crossover success as a country performer who was involved in more liberal causes, while the black Floridian Ray Charles was a Republican.  I mention this just to highlight what ironic and unusual paths people's lives can take.

The film covers the life of Johnny Cash roughly from his early childhood until just before his marriage to June Carter.  In talking to friends, I have been amazed that even those who have seen the film were unaware of June Carter's background, and when I mentioned the Carter Family they were not clear on who they were.  If there is a First Family in American country music, it is the Carter Family.  Along with Jimmy Rodgers, they were the most influential act in early country music history, and those two along with Hank Williams are the genre's greatest musical influences.  Formed by A. P. Carter, Maybelle Carter was his sister-in-law and one of the most important influences on American guitar finger picking, developing the walking bass note that is fundamental to music ever since.  When A. P. and his wife divorced, Maybelle took over the group, involving her daughters in what was essentially the second version of the Carter Family.  June was one of those daughters.

Before their deaths June and Johnny Cash gave their blessings to this production and gave final approval to the performers who would play them.  On the acting end of things both performers are simply outstanding, and both fully deserve the Oscar nominations both have received.  Reese Witherspoon is simply adorable as June Carter, generating more charisma than one could think possible.  She is much shorter than the real June Carter, but since Joaquin Phoenix is much, much shorter than Johnny Cash, giving away about a half a foot, their heights are not terribly disproportionate.  Both performers worked vigorously on their singing in preparing for the film.  Reese, especially, does a good job with her singing.  She doesn't capture that snarl that made June Carter so much fun to listen to, but she nonetheless does a very credible job singing.  Phoenix gives it a great try, but how could any actor be asked to emulate Johnny Cash?  It simply can't be done.  Johnny Cash had one of the few great bass voices in popular music and even though for the most part he sang in a baritone range, there was always a depth and deepness to his voice that undergirt all he did.  And when he did need to drop down for those low, low, low notes, he did so effortlessly.  Phoenix simply can't pull it off. It really isn't his fault at all.  No other actor I know of could have done any better.  He does, however, at least pull off a lot of the rambunctiousness of the young Johnny Cash.  My daughter when in junior high bought a poster of the young Johnny Cash and put it in her room.  It shows Johnny Cash leaning forward from the stage towards the audience, almost savage in his demeanor, pointing one hand towards someone in the crowd, middle finger extended in an obscene gesture.  As he aged, perhaps calmed by his relationship with June it became more difficult to discern that wild man, but Phoenix certainly captures much of that.

All in all, this is a very good movie and I enjoyed every aspect of it.  My only serious regret is Phoenix's singing.  This is unfortunately not a peripheral matter.  Johnny Cash possessed one of the most unique, marvelous voices of his generation, and having anyone play him who cannot absolutely nail the singing would be a mistake.  It would be like having someone play Frank Sinatra.  You have to get the voice.  Still, it would be a hard person who couldn't find a great deal in this film to love.  And if for no other reason, one has to see this simply to see how precious Reese Witherspoon is.",1140566400,8,4808,4.649289099526066

The film follows a paint-by-numbers formula I have seen many times before. The dialogue does not measure up, but the actors make it work.

Joaquin Phoenix finally becomes a man and an actor in his own right -living out of the shadow of his legendary deceased older brother River Phoenix.

Reese Witherspoon, who has become increasingly one-note and bland (and has the box office flops to prove it - Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) finds a role that allows her to stretch for the first time since her breakthrough in Election. Will she win the Oscar? Yes. Does she deserve it? No.

1609004,5,B00005JO1R,"I recently saw this in the theater and had mixed feelings going in. The story seemed similar to last year's Oscar winning biopic on Ray Charles and I wasn't sure a story about Johnny Cash would hold my interest for two hours. After all, this was the singer my dad used to listen to. Little did I know how fascinating Cash's tale would be.

The story touches on Cash's childhood and the tragedy and abuse that would provide the basis for many of his songs. Johnny Cash didn't have the nicest voice but when he sings about pain and regret, you honestly believe he's inside Folsom Prison. Most of the film charts Cash's inevitable path from aspiring songwriter to cultural icon. He has the expected bumps along the way but the tale ends up being inspiring. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon turn in Oscar worthy performances as Cash and his wife and frequent collaborator June Carter Cash. A fun part of the films is that Johnny and June were contemporaries of Elvis, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis and we get to see them represented as well.

These kinds of movies are good for people of my generation because they bring home exactly how innovative and visionary the performers of the past were. It's easy to hear Johnny Cash's voice over an Alamo commercial or see Ray Charles crooning about Diet Pepsi and think they are just silly old men trying to milk their fame. Movies like this make us reinvestigate their pasts to see exactly how trend setting they were. Johnny Cash and Ray Charles were cool, they were the very essence of cool. It would be difficult to imagine the performers of today, many of whom are overindulged and overrated, paying the kinds of dues these guys did and coming up with anything as unique.",1140480000,23,1724,4.612377850162867

I immediately went out and bought a 2 disc set of Johnny Cash's greatest hits and I will purchase the Soundtrack. June Cash was a heck of a woman. June was in love with Johnny for years and only when he overcame his addiction did she admit her love for him.  He was worth the wait.

Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldn't help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances.

1609011,5,B00005JO1R,"It could be said that ""Walk the line"" is a movie about the life of Johnny Cash, a very well-known American artist that overcame all kinds of difficulties to become famous and share his music with the public. However, it would be more accurate to point out that this film is centered both on Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and the love they had for each other.

The opening sequence is wonderful, and will make you realize that you weren`t wrong in choosing to watch ""Walk the line"". That feeling is likely to be specially strong if, like me, you don't really know a lot about Johnny Cash, and just want to watch a good and entertaining film. Notwithstanding that, you will also end up learning quite a few things about one of the most important American musicians of all time, and about a period in which many conventions were being broken by new artists.

This film tells the spectator about Johnny Cash's childhood and his bad relationship with his father (played by Robert Patrick), his time in the Air Force, and the beginnings of his music career, when he met people like Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Elvis (Tyler Hilton), and the love of his life, singer June Carter. There was a big problem though: Cash was already married to another woman, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), something that June didn't forget, and repeated to Johnny every time she rejected his attempts to go beyond a friendship.

The scenes where Johnny struggles with his addiction to drugs and with depression are quite difficult to watch, probably due to the fact that Joaquin Phoenix delivers a splendid performance. Reese Witherspoon is also outstandingly good as June, the person that saves Johnny Cash from himself.

All the same, I want to mention that ""Walk the line"" is not all about drama. There are funny moments too, and also some wonderful scenes recreating Johnny's concerts that allow you to listen to the real deal. Oh well, maybe not the real deal, because Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing, but their version of those concerts is an extremely good one. I am seriously thinking about buying not only a cd with Cash's more important songs, but also another with the soundtrack of this movie. Listening to Phoenix singing ""Folsom Prison Blues"" is no hardship!

On the whole, I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough. It is not perfect, but it is the kind of movie that you simply must see and enjoy. No regrets  :)

1609054,5,B00005JO1R,"""Hello. I'm Johnny Cash...""

Steller performances and a gripping adapted soundtrack make ""Walk the Line"" one of the best films I personally have seen in a long time.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon display radiant chemistry starring together as legendary country music icons Johnny Cash and June Carter. The story weaves inside the life and mind of musically-driven Cash who is swarmed into the spotlight with his ""sharp like a razor"" sound. But the torments the childhood loss of his brother, his breaking marriage, as well as misunderstandings with his father rapidly lead to a heavy addiction to drugs. June Carter (played by a magnificent Witherspoon) acts as a mentor and inspiration to Cash, as well as his soul mate for whom he is very much in love with.

There are several aspects of this film that I want to mention. I'll start with the opening credits. Wow, from the very first moment I have to say I was completely taken aback. It's difficult to explain to those who haven't seen it, but those who have, I'm sure you'll agree with me what an utterly stunning opening it was, with that infectious country beat contrasted with the confides of the prison. It was riveting, and immediately I knew this was going to be a wonderful film.

Jaoquin Phoenix was captivating as Cash, and I was impressed with the depth of similarities between him and his character. We all know of River Phoenix, Jaoquin's late brother who suddenly died of drug overdose in the early 90s. Then ofcourse was Joaquin's own battle with substance and drug abuse. Whether he meant these details to impact or not, Joaquin's performance is so honest and raw, one MUST draw the parallels. But alone the performance is inspired and he well deserved the Golden Globe.

Reese Witherspoon is as you've never seen her (ie Brunette!) as June Carter, and she's marvellous. I could really relate and connect with her character. As mentioned earlier, the on-screen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon was so strong and poignant. I could really sense the connection.

Last but certainly not least is the music, which acts as the third character in this bio-epic. Phoenix and Witherspoon as you know put their own singing skills to the test here, and the result is amazing! I will be the first to admit country music is CERTAINLY not my thing, but even I found Cash's melodies and the actors' impression of them captivating. My views on country music were definately changed after this film. So if you are, like me, not a fan of country music, this film will certainly be an exception to that.

""Walk the Line"" exceeded all my expectations and was a truly insightful, inspiring and moving love story. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon light up the silver screen and put in the finest performances so far in their careers. It's a film about self acceptance and companionship, that will certainly move you and make you think twice about country music. From it's thrilling beginning to it's heartwarming end, ""Walk the Line"" is a wonderful film!",1140220800,13,3024,4.848837209302325

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a beautiful job portraying Johnny and June. I think more so Joaquin definately looked a lot like Johnny Cash, even the way he moved his mouth and how he talked was just like him. Both Joaquin and Reese took all their time and effort to sing and sound like Johnny Cash and June Carter.

1609057,4,B00005JO1R,"Having just seen the movie for the second time,just in time for the Oscars,I can truly say that this is one of the best musical biopics I've ever seen. The ""Man In Black"" stands tall next to last year's ""Ray"" as a testiment to the power of a well told story....especially if it's true.

  For this generation of movie goers,""Walk The Line"" is a real eye-opener in terms of showing younger audiences just how powerful an impact Johnny Cash made in the music world. For older audiences who've been fans of Cash for years,the film confirms what they already knew:Johnny Cash carried all of the weight of the misery he endured in his life in every dark vocal he sang.

  The film itself follows the new form of telling bios in that they try and have a ""moral"" to the story. In the case of ""Ray"",it was how a person with a disability could overcome to achieve great things. In ""Walk The Line"",the moral center of this tale is how the love of a good woman can save a man's soul.

  On that note,the film follows the rise of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from his beginings as the ""black sheep"" youngest child to a poor cotton farming family,who was haunted by the death of his sainted big brother,to his stint in the Air Force,through his early recording years at the legendary Sun Records Studio,through his struggle with an addiction to alcohol and drugs,to his redemption thanks to his singing partner and friend,June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).

  Aside from being a great romantic tale,the film also serves as a lesson in music history. As Johnny rises to fame at Sun Records through early hits such as ""Cry,Cry,Cry"",""Get Rhythm"",and ""Folsom Prison Blues"",he goes out on tour with Sun's other rising young stars:Jerry Lee Lewis (played to looney perfection by Waylon Malloy),Carl Perkins,Roy Orbison,Waylon Jennings (played by his son,Shooter Jennings),and of course,Elvis Presley. For me personally,at 26,I only heard Cash's big hits like ""Walk The Line"" and ""Folsom"".I did not know he sang ""Get Rhythm"".The first time I saw the film,there were alot of 20-somethings in there like me who probably didn't know much about Cash.....I wonder if any of them went out and got one of his Greatest Hits Collections.....

  As I close this out,I'd like to point out something that I've seen other reviewers grumble about:Joaquin and Reese's singing. First off,NOBODY sounds like Johnny Cash. That being said,I give Phoenix an ""A"" for effort. Hey! At least he learned to play the guitar and tried to sound like Cash. That's what gave the film the weight of reality it needed. The same goes with Reese's singing and portrayal of June Carter. She may not've been ""note perfect"" in sounding like June....but I think her portrayal proves that she can act outside of ""fluffy"" romantic comedies.

  If you're looking for a damn good,not to mention entertaining,biopic....""Walk The Line"" fills the bill....Now.... If you'll excuse me...I must go and pre-order my copy of the film.",1140134400,11,2963,4.880239520958084

I have never been a country music fan nor indeed a Johnny Cash fan, but this movie made him come alive. Watching both sensational stars singing and acting their way through the life of John and June Carter Cash they became them.  It was an enjoyable and uplifting film.",1140048000,6,378,4.385714285714286
1609059,3,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" is Reese Witherspoon's final ascent into movie stardom, maybe even her declaration as America's Leading Lady, seeing as Julia Roberts doesn't have much interest anymore, Gwyneth Paltrow's drifted into obscurity, Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts and Charlize Theron were born south of the equator and Renee Zellweger just isn't very good looking.

Spunky, cute, self-effacing, Witherspoon's made a lot of crap (and a lot of money off it), a few gems (""Election,"" ""American Psycho""), and this OK biopic about Johnny and June Carter Cash that's a perfect vehicle for her talent - mixin it up with the boys, flirtin, mouthin off, cryin, lovin, hurtin. The Blue Plate Sally Field.

Pedestrian director James Mangold wisely builds his movie around John(played  by Joaquin Phoenix) and June's protracted affair that begins on their first tour while they're married. That Cash-brand folk music runs underneath most scenes, but ""Walk The Line,"" aims to be a love story, and succeeds. Phoenix and Witherspoon have the necessary chemistry, and Cash's first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) is slanted as such a grim, unhappy grinch it is a small joy when she orders John to take down a photo of June and walks out when he refuses. It's still several years before June agrees to marry John, but the way is finally clear. There's only a drug habit to kick and some self-abuse to endure.

""Walk The Line"" has a backstory for all the pain - a mean father (Robert Patrick) who blames John for his brother's death, that grim wife, the drugs, the alcohol, the tours, several bad influences (which include Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis). We assume the music is written somewhere in there; we see John on stage and at Folsom Prison, but not in the studio. Maybe rightly so - Cash was revered more as the Man In Black than as a talent; unlike ""Ray,"" which cared about how Ray Charles created his art and survived by his business savvy, ""Walk The Line"" envisions Cash as little more than the guy who attends corporate meetings standing up, shades on, some country James Dean with the Holy Spirit bolting through him. Phoenix's performance addresses the legend more than the man. It's all blowups, booze and romance from the gut.

Witherspoon does something different with June; she embodies the reluctant-yet-radiant everywoman, a tough skin, soft center, an archetype as old as Shakespeare. June starts with small questions and warm smiles inside a diner. She progresses to a scene when, in a moment of sincere affection, she tells John just what she wants to say about his talent, and what John never has heard from his father or wife. Who doesn't fall in love with that? That June finally falls too makes sense because John adores her.

There's no mystery in Witherspoon. No hidden cards. She brings the same tomboyish, attractive skills to every movie, and for each ""Walk The Line,"" there is a ""Vanity Fair,"" where, regardless of her diligence, the magic is lacking. She's not a master talent like Meryl Streep or Kidman, but a punch-the-clock professional who, when she chooses wisely, can pack charm, wit and sweetness into one of the best performances of the year. Audiences like her, they really like her.",1140048000,2,3188,4.894444444444445

1609061,4,B00005JO1R,"Because it is based on two of his own published memoirs (""Cash: the Autobiography"" and ""The Man in Black""), ""Walk the Line"" becomes, in many ways, the ""official"" movie biography of musician/singer/songwriter Johnny Cash - and it isn't really the movie's fault that it arrives so close on the heels of ""Ray,"" the equally critically acclaimed film about Ray Charles.  The similarities between the two stories are, at times, positively amazing:  the meteoric rise to stardom, the unhappy marriage, the serial philandering, the substance abuse, the arrest for drug possession.  Heck, there's even the death of a beloved brother in a freak childhood accident that comes to haunt both the men for the rest of their lives.  Yet, ""Walk the Line, "" written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold and directed by Mangold, triumphs over its biopic cliches thanks to solid writing, toe-tapping musical numbers and superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the key roles of Cash and singing superstar - and future wife - June Carter.

Phoenix pours his whole heart and soul into his performance both as an actor and as a singer, reproducing Cash's sound and vocal intonations with uncanny accuracy.  Witherspoon captures Carter's sizzle and spunk perfectly, yet brings a real sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the character.  Their romantic scenes together are some of the best in the film and it is as a romance, rather than as a cautionary tale of the perils of show business, that the movie really connects with its audience.

Mr. Phoenix is a revelation, as he always is, as the tortured Cash, and Mrs. Whiterspoon could not be better as the firey June Carter. I went in knowing little of Johnny Cash's earlier music, save Ring Of Fire and I Walk The Line, however, coming out of the movie I found myself humming the tunes to Jackson, Cocaine Blues, and Folsom Prision Blues. So basically, top-notch music.

All in all, Walk The Line was the most emotionally engrossing experience I had at the movie theatre last year. I reecomend it to anyone and everyone.",1139961600,5,654,4.637931034482759

1609125,5,B00005JO1R,"...and I guess, despite some ""evil"" rumours about wether ""Walk the line"" is true to Cashs' real life or not, this movie should answer many questions. Personally I didn't really know that much about Johnny Cash before I went to see this movie, and I must say it made a deep impression.

It is a sad story, and you really struggle with Cash throughout the movie. His life indeed was no picnic, being the invisible son to his fathers' eyes, the loss of his best friend and older brother favored of the two even long after his early, tragic death (this truely haunts Johnny Cash, and the cold relationship between him and his father), his drug and alcohol abuse the way it grows along with his carreer, his turbulent marriage, Johnny Cash simply doesn't function until he is gradually saved by his one and only true love -June Carter. From his early days listening to her voice on the radio as a kid (she was a child star), it also grows to become a gripping, beautiful lovestory. ""Walk the line"" introduces Johnny Cash as a kind and gentle, but a soulsick and lonely man. Until the outcome of his relationship with June Carter that is. The ending has a tone of the ""...and they lived happily ever after...""-kind, and it is well earned!

It is brilliantly expressed between many of his old music-classics, with great acting and the dialogue in focus. The filming could not have been better, and the timing -well, not an uninteresting, dull moment. J.Phoenix is Johnny Cash, R.Witherspoon is June Carter -and I must say that especially she managed to impress me (and perhaps for the first time, the girl can act!) I was impressed by Val Kilmer in ""The Doors"", I am just as impressed by J.Phoenix from his appearence in ""Walk the line"".

The singing was very good and it was as if Johnny was singing again.  It depicts a very troubled life, full of despair and pain.

1609129,5,B00005JO1R,"The short reply to describing ""Walk the Line"" is that it is a solid, real-life story of redemption, of a man who finds out who he is and sings from his heart. The story of Johnny Cash's life is told well, sung well, and produced well.

Johnny Cash's life is one spared of the consequences of his worst mistakes. When his first wife left him after realizing Johnny's character was in question, when drugs and affairs began to ruin him, he found June. When drugs and alcohol took him down, he found his soul and his way back up.

""Walk the Line"" covers the transformation of a child blamed for his brother's accidental death, the drive to succeed as a gospel singer, and the desire to be loved without restrictions.

I like Johnny Cash. Always have. His voice sounded off-the-cuff, like someone called him on stage unexpectedly. It is rough, resonant with tobacco and alcohol strained vocal cords, with enough twang to keep it country and enough power to keep it rock. All of these come through adequately in Joaquin Phoenix's attempts, but he's no Johnny Cash. That's a tough act to follow, and I give Phoenix credit for as much as he pulls off musically.

Beyond my thoughts of Phoenix's mediocre singing, I give him applause for acting. Not only does he have Cash's signature talking from the side of his mouth, but he has the attitude, the stare, the characteristics that remind me of the Johnny Cash seen on TV throughout the years.

Reese Witherspoon delivers a persona of June Carter that is extraordinarily sweet. It has to believe she went through so many marriages before finally settling on Johnny. She sings well, and to the ear who has not heard the original, she's enjoyable. The comparison between the two is not fair: one is a musical icon, and the other is only portraying the icon.

As storytelling goes, the movie ends in the late 1960s. Johnny and June's life is summed up with that they lived happily ever after. It misses the complete transition, where Johnny's broken life appears to have been a dream, where he goes on to sing more great songs, and even sings for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association crusades.

To compare the three recent biopics I have seen, this is the best. While ""Ray"" is powerful, Ray Charles' own life only evolves. It never transforms. He is only a great singer and a good man at the end. Johnny becomes a great man after not being much of one.

In ""Beyond the Sea,"" it lacks by comparison because, partly, Bobby Darin's life was shorter and less dramatic, and also, Cash's catalog of hits is volumes larger.

By the end of ""Beyond the Sea,"" I was tired of a few songs. In ""Walk the Line,"" I kept thinking, ""Where's 'Don't Take Your Guns To Town,' 'Guess Things Happen That Way,' and 'Sunday Morning Coming Down'? What about 'A Boy Named Sue'?"" I wanted more music. Those are fantastic, but the movie's director could not use them all.

Shaky parts of the movie are found in how it seems Johnny's spiral downward always held to a glimmer that he was a good man making bad choices. However true that is, it came off whitewashing some of the uglier sides of his hard times, and missed an opportunity to show why his songs have credibility.

See it in the theater to enjoy their sound system while you still can.

I fully recommend ""Walk the Line.""

1609130,5,B00005JO1R,"Honestly, I was incredulous when Ray was getting all the attention it was getting.

I was incredulous when Walk the Line was getting all the attention it was getting.

And what do you know but that is but an arbitrary and minor parallel that ties these two brilliant works of art together.

While some people might complain about a formula developing, such a complaint is slightly unfair.  Sure, the focus of the two movies are similar enough that the exposition of the storyline sometimes seems a bit familiar, something that in a time where originality is upheld as one of the highest virtues, might lead people in the wrong direction about regarding works such as these critically.

So they both involve a death of a brother at a young age.  Uh, those deaths?  They actually happened.  So they both involve drug addiction.  Uh, that actually happened.  So they both involve adultery and special love interest.  Well, that actually happened.  And you say it's a shame how both deal so much with post-traumatic stress disorder?  Well... with the things they've gone through.

But focusing on Walk the Line alone now, let us contemplate on what this movie so GOOD.

For one thing, the acting comes readily to mind.  Acting is one of the most readily apparent and focused on parts of filmmaking for the reason that it's basically what makes or breaks the story.  The acting in this film?  Brilliant, and I'm not just saying that.  Joaquin phoenix's role isn't just unbelievable... it's really believable.  Reese Witherspoon pulls of June Carter and honestly it's difficult to imagine an actress like her actually pulling the strings like that.  Okay, so I'm biased because she's been in mainstream movies of little importance.  But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.

And then they can both sing, which I find hilarious considering most vocalists of modern bands can't even seem to sing yet two actors can and can also sing exactly like the people they're portraying.  Ahhh, the state of modern music... but I digress.

Secondly, the writing.  As discussed above, the story follows the same rough outline as Ray, but it is different in this way: Johnny Cash is a different character than Ray Charles.  Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented.  It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.

Oh, and the music.  I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff.  It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.

Then of course there's the directing and the cinematography.  Specifically, if anyone's doubting the impactfulness of the work behind the camera, I argue to rewatch that long shot where Cash tears apart the bathroom.  Watch how everything possible seems to be at full work here, movement, zoom, acting, makeup, set design, music, atmosphere, lighting, all targeted in such a way that it does not feel reasonable to assume that such a take could ever be done again, even if all the same mechanics were at work.

Okay, so I've basically just hyped it up a whole lot more, adding to that same hype that has people tired and sick of the whole idea of the movie before they've seen it.  Admit it, the mere fact that it's been nominated for some Oscars means that it already feels overrated.  I know exactly what you mean...

...afterall, what made me wait to see it so long?

But whatever.  Think what you want.  I think this film is pretty darned great.  I'm just sayin'.

1609131,5,B00005JO1R,"This movie is incredible, both Reese and Joaquin mold into their roles more and more as the movie goes on and by the second half you have to remind yourself that it really isn't Johnny and June.  From beginning to end you are treated to the heart of the characters and the musical performances outreached my wildest dreams.  The history of the era is demonstrated through the camaraderie of other up and rising musical greats of the time.  Their road trips together are classic and the portrayal of these personalities will make you laugh as you are treated to what seems like an endless streams of live concerts all across the United States. However, the most captivating and believable theme is the friendship and romance of June and Johnny.  As a friend she stood by him through the most down and out period of his life, his best friend and this movie excellently portrays her dedication to him as a person and how that understandably translates into his absolute adoration of her.  Extremely well done, I am looking forward to seeing it again.",1139443200,4,1047,4.699453551912568
1609190,4,B00005JO1R,"My wife introduced me to Cash's music only 5 years ago and I knew little about his story. This film whetted my appetite to know more since many reviews say it only hints at the real darkness in his life. The Spanish title is Johnny and June: Madness and Passion. I wholeheartedly agree about the passion aspect, Joaquin Phoenix is nigh on perfect as Cash from his stance, speech patterns to his on-stage persona, but we only see flashes of the madness (a few amphetamines too many, a Zeppelinesque outburst in his dressing room and a mano-a-maquina with his Massey Ferguson).

The relationship with June is very well developed- and though not knowing much about her- I can only say that it's a perfectly believable love story. The music throughout is well chosen and this morning I woke up with Ring of Fire echoing around my mind (which makes a pleasant change from ""Can't get you out of my head""...).

If this doesn't spark yet another Cash revival I don't know what will. Fantastic performances all round, a great soundtrack and a gripping story make for a very memorable film. I hope we see a sequel as the closing credits' ""They toured for 30 odd years then died"" doesn't really do justice to the rest of this incredible man's journey.

1609191,5,B00005JO1R,"If you look through my review list, you'll see that I don't write movie reviews, I write book reviews.  The main reason for that is, Hollywood doesn't come up with much that I think is worth reviewing.  I would say that 90% of the movies I have watched failed to hold my interest and in the end, I usually wish I had the last 2 hours of my life back.  Last night, however, I watched WALK THE LINE and was in for a big surprise.

I had seen the previews and it appeared that Juaquin Phoenix was able to pull off the roll of Johnny Cash, but for the life of me, I could not grasp the beautiful Reese Witherspoon pulling off the roll of the homely June Carter. Boy was I ever wrong. Phoenix exceeded my expectations.  His performance was comparable to to that of Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles in RAY, for which I believe he won best actor, and Witherspoon just blew me away with the accuracy of her performance.

The other cast members were equally compelling.  The band members were mirror images of the Tennessee Three.  The lovely actress playing Cash's first wife had a striking resemblance to Rosanne Cash, and Mother Mabel Carter's roll could not have been portrayed better. In all, the casting for this movie was some of the best ever.

This is a great movie and, I believe, a fairly accurate portrayal of Johnny Cash. Whether you are a fan of Cash's music or not, this movie is certainly 2 hours well spent.",1139097600,6,1413,4.383141762452107

1609194,3,B00005JO1R,"I grew up in the country on a farm in N.S.W.  Australia and as a child of 7 years of age, on of my first recollections of music in and around the home was that of a one Mr Johnny Cash. Well folks I am now 42 years old, a musician and still very much in awe of the Man In Black, no one had a voice like him and he was an amazing storyteller and songwriter. With the exception of maybe Mr Hank Williams, Mr J Cash is in a league  of his own, as one of the most unique singers to ever emerge from the American C&W  scene. With that said Walk the Line, the James Mangold directed Johnny Cash bio-pic was released nationally today in Australia. Of course I wasted no time in making it to the first session available,whilst overall I was not completely dissapointed I just felt that this film seemed to lack that special magic. You know, that  something that makes you want to see a great film over and over again (regardless of the films genre). I must also mention here that  I have worked in the video/dvd rental business for over 10 years and I love watching and talking about movies. And as much as a Johnny Cash fan as I am, I just can't say that I love this film about one off my all time musical hereos. I just felt that at times, Mangold (DIR) played in safe in the usual Hollywood way  and made a typical flick by the numbers, so as not to get his Hollywood bosses breathing down his back. This film reminded me very much of Great Balls of Fire,the Jerry Lee Lewis bio-pic with a very inspiring performance by  Dennis Quade as the killer. And just like that film, Walk the Line barely touches the surface of what both these great performers were all about. I must say though, in all fairness, it would probably take amost an entire lifetime just to tell Johnny Cash's story. So in nutshell, what I personally think went wrong with this film is some overly heavy handed directing and some equally heavy handed editing. I genuinly feel that the film suffers for these compromises, a tougher director (would have loved to have seen what Scorsese or Gus van Sant may have acheived)may have fought harder for his/her film to be made and cut the way they wanted it. Who know's,its all speculation anyway,thats enough rambling lets get  onto the review. Phoenix's performance of the Man in black is stellar and incendiary, you really get the feeling he has pulled out all stops to walk a mile(or better still walk the line) in the great mans shoes. Although he never really looks exactly like JC, except for maybe  when Johnny was young, he has enough of the great man's Cashism's down, to help make the character convincing and real enough. While it comes as no surprise, Reese Witherspoon does an amazing job of playing June Carter Cash, the often overshadowed offsping of  America's answer to country music's royal family, the Carter's. Witherspoon has been a rock solid performer over the span of her career so far and is equally adept as an actress at playing light and fluffy roles such as Legally Blonde, to playing a pyschotic, sex crazed student ,running for school president in the excellent, Election. So as you can see by most other reviews posted here, it's not the actors performances that let this film down so much but maybe a more behind the scenes problem. The soundtrack is great with musical direction coming from Mr T Bone Burnette so he knows what he is doing,this includes all the incidental tracks that he has chosen as well, to match the periods etc. Once again personally for me, it  was (she really did look like she was playing the autoharp? I'm still not sure)Witherspoon's singing voice that was stronger and it won me over more than Phoenix's effort. In all fairness though, Phoenix's singing was still credible and to try and impersonate one of the most unique voices on the planet is a tall order for anyone,my hat still goes of to him. This probably explains why there are so many  Elvis impersonators and so very few Johnny Cash ones, so far in Ausatralia I have never seen a Johnny Cash impersonator. Special mention must also go to Robert (Terminator 2)Patrick for getting to play the father of not one, but two off the biggest names in the music business, in such a short space of time. Remember him  as Elvis's dad in the recent made for television Presley Estate approved bio-pic, I found this quite amusing, almost like they had cast him on purpose as the worst inside joke of bio-pic history. So to sum up if you loved Johnny Cash chances are you will find more to like about this film than to dislike and if your like me you'll probably be left a little wanting. As far as bio-pic's go this one plays pretty hard and fast  down the middle of the road, so as not to alienate everyone that isn't a  Johnny Cash fan or for that matter a fan of country music. Also of note I must give mention to the stunning costumes and set direction,they have done an excellent job and it is a real treat for all you hardcore retrophiles and atomic stylists. I will still buy this on DVD when relesed,as well as the soundtrack, I have no doubt that the DVD will be stacked with so many extras, that it will  more than make up for a lot of the films shortcomings. Finally on a lighter note there are two kinds of people when it comes to country and western music those that hate it and those that really hate it. Enjoy the movie folks and I hope all this inept rambling will be of  use too some off the people out there.",1138924800,4,5441,4.403386454183267

With all the hype, I figured it would be either great or terrible, but I was wrong. Walk the Line is above average, but that is principally due to the excellence of its actors. Phoenix and Witherspoon are far more inspired than one can imagine. They pay exquisite homage to these deceased legends. It makes you want to go back and watch every documentary ever made just so you can experience the real thing. Phoenix had the great man's every idiosyncrasy down, and the way he hunches his shoulders up as he struts around during live performances was almost eerie. Outside of individual performances, the film itself was rather erratic. One should understand in advance though that this is not the life and times of Johnny Cash. It is his life in the context of his relationship with June Carter which makes it far less interesting than it otherwise would be. Really, the problem with it is that the movie skirts the line between bio and chick flick with the latter being far too pronounced. It is not great cinema but its craftsmanship and devotion to detail place it on a plane far above the rest which Hollywood usually offers.",1138924800,6,1264,4.524017467248909

I was blown away by Reese's singing voice...she belt out such an amazing sound, off the charts! She is an amazing entertainer.

The beginning of the movie gave me shivers....the setting was so thrilling and the music was pounding while the guards marched through the penitentiary. It was so intense that I was completely revved up for the show.

The entire movie was amazing although I couldn't beleive the actors they chose for Elvis and Jerry Lee....They should not have been cast....Joaquine and Reese put them to shame.

Being a fan of this Great family of Country Music(I'm going back to the days when June's mother-Maybell was recording in Bristol with her cousin Sarah and her husband Alvin Pleasant (A.P.Carter)in 1927).

  This movie was a real tribute to Johnny and June. If a person who does not have a lot of knowledge really listens to the different conversations during the course of the movie one can really learn first hand about their life as many things that are being talked about are true to life. Take for example when June sees Johnny in the Diner and they speak for a while about June's singing and June exclaimes,""My sister Anita is the singer,she is the one with the pipes"". Every Real Carter Family Fan knows that Anita Carter was infact ""The one with the pipes"", even to this day many feel myself included that Anita Carter was the best Female Country Singer of the 50's,60's and 70's. If you ever get a chance to see the old film of her singing a duet with Hank Williams doing""I can't help it..."" you will know what I mean.

Just listen and you will learn. My wife and I have just about every LP that Johnny ever put out(don't miss out on the two new box sets-Johnny's 4CDset and June's 2CDset, We have both and they are Great).We were both glued to the TV set back in 1969 when the J.C. Show was on TV and we were both smitten when first June then Johnny passed. This movie is so well done that it can take you right back to Arkansas and also in the shadow of Clinch Mountain,VA where it all started for these two.

Do yourself a favor wheather you are a Hillbilly or not and see this Great motion picture that will truly become a real part of Genuine Americana, you won't be sorry !

I grew up with Johnny Cash and June Carters music and this movie helped me come to know them and what they went through to become ""one."" I would reccomend it to all to go see it. It is worth the price of a ticket and as part of any collection. Whenever you think your having it rough and don't see the light at the end of that dark tunnel, watch this movie. There is a rainbow at the end of every trial you may be going through. If you have had dealings with any of the things these two have been through, drugs, failed marriages, alcohol, do as they did, put your trust and faith in Jesus and you, to, will overcome anything that comes your way as Johnny and June did. This movie is very inspirational to anyone who may be going through a valley right now. It is a movie about hope, faith and struggles we all go through but it's also about winning the battles in our everyday life. I hope that as you watch this movie, you see yourself in some area of it and that you also find your strength to come out victorious at the end.  damama_d",1137456000,3,1100,4.092592592592593
1609256,5,B00005JO1R,"""Hey my darlin' hey my sweet

I've waited on the day that I knew we would meet.

Hey my sun, hey my moon

Today's the day that

Johnny met June.""

I know that Shelby Lynne wrote ""Johnny met June"" after the death of Johnny Cash, four months after the passing of June Carter Cash, but it was impossible for me not to think of that song while watching ""I Walk the Line,"" even before I realized that Lynne was playing Cash's mother Carrie.  That is because it is clear from the start of this 2005 bio-pic that this is the love story of Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) and June (Reese Witherspoon).  In the last act of the film my wife expressed surprise that the couple were not married yet and I told her that this film was going to be over as soon as she finally said ""yes.""  I was close on that score, because the film includes an important grace note and fade out that says it all.  But even if you knew nothing about their legendary love it would be clear from the opening scenes of this movie when a young J.R. Cash and his brother Jack are listening to young June Carter singing on the radio.

What I liked about ""Walk the Line"" was that even knowing the key threads of the story, all of which are cinematic commonplaces, the screenplay by writer Gill Dennis and director James Mangold delivers memorable scenes.  One thread is how Cash became the Man in Black, and when he blows his audition in front of Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), the legendary head of Sun Records in Memphis gives him a slim second chance with a dead on speech as to how Cash needs to be singing songs.  Cash happens to have been inspired by a film about a prison in California to write a song, and he starts to sing it and changes before our eyes and ears.  Cash and his father, Ray (Robert Patrick), have been at odds since a childhood tragedy and we wait for the moment when the son will finally tell the father off.  But when it comes Cash is still living in a glass house and the tables do not get turned.

""Walk the Line"" saves the best for last.  The famous concert at Folsom Prison is the first of two significant payoffs, as it represents Cash finally embodying his songs and not simply singing them.  The connection between Cash and his audience changed then and he finally became a man.  But that was not enough for June who has been refusing all of his proposals.  When his family could do nothing to save Cash from his drug addiction, it is June and her family who step in, however she makes it clear that she will sing with him but she will not marry him.  Now, most of us remember the lady as June Carter Cash, so we know that she is going to say yes.  What is important is that it clearly will take something special for her to consent, and this film comes up with a moment worthy of their relationship and out anticipation.

Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing and what is key is not that they imitate Johnny and June but that they capture their hearts, which is a good thing in a romance, even when it also happens to be a bio-pic.  During the final credits we finally hear the real Johnny and June singing as they take their curtain call.  But when their voices fade away and we return to the plaintive guitar pickin' of T-Bone Burnett our thoughts return to Lynne's lovely elegy:

""Now were starting over it's the place that we are

You look more than pretty underneath all the stars

Love, love is a burning thing

Oh how I still love to hear you sing

And everything we ever heard about heaven is true

Today's the day that Johnny met June

Today's the day that Johnny met June.""",1137369600,8,3579,4.289120715350224
1609257,5,B00005JO1R,"I will preface this by saying I was never a big Johnny Cash fan, but after seeing the excellent way Hollywood handled Ray Charles (""Ray"") and Bobby Darin (""Beyond the Sea"") I was anxious to see what it would do for The Man in Black.  The results are phenomenal.  Now, I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to John and June when they were still living.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are phenomenal as Johnny and June Carter Cash.  This unlikely casting yields such outstanding results that I would hand them both the Oscar right now if I could.  I read that Reese almost bailed on the project when she found out she had to do her own singing, but you would never know it from the great vocals and spunky performances she delivers.

The film focuses on their love affair, first as friends and then torrid even while he was married to his first wife and the mother of his children.  His drug abuse is highlighted but it is Johnny Cash, the complex man and his love for June Carter, darling daughter of the close-knit and totally supportive Carter clan,  that comes shining through and makes this a totally enjoyable movie.

Two big thumbs up for a movie that thrills from its opening at the infamous Folsom Prison to its spectatcular closing.",1136851200,85,1248,4.560538116591928
1609258,5,B00005JO1R,"This is one of the best biopics that I have ever watched.  This, like Jamie Fox's portrayal of Ray Charles in 2004's ""Ray"" is an outstanding film.  Phoenix and Witherspoon are brilliant and convincing in their roles as Johnny Cash, colorful folk writer and his wife, June Carter Cash.

Viewers are pulled in immediately.  The first scene was of a 1968 performance at the infamous Folsom Prison, made even more so by Johnny Cash's song of that title.

The filmed story of Cash's life begins in the 1940s with young Johnny Cash and his brother, an aspiring ""Preacher Man.""  Johnny demonstrates a flair for music at an early age and his brother a talent for quoting Scripture.  Sadly, Johnny's brother dies in an accident and Johnny copes by joining the Army and writing folk songs.

I loved the way the history of the songs was included, such as ""Folsom Prison.""  Cash was married prior to marrying June Carter Cash.  The first marriage ended after 3 daughters and different lifestyles.

June Carter Cash, famous for telling her soulmate, ""I'll Meet You Halfway"" came from a long line of folk singers and performers.  Her family rallied around Johnny Cash and helped him kick the dope habit.  I just loved it when her dad chased a dealer off, sending the man scurrying away in his 1964 Ford Ranchero.

The song selection is excellent and the cast did a stellar job of portraying Cash & Carter.  All in all, a solid performance.",1136332800,4,1425,4.689516129032258
1609289,4,B00005JO1R,"Aside from ""Boy named Sue,"" ""Ring of Fire"" and a couple other classic hits, I'm not much of a Johnny Cash fan. Still, I had an indistinct respect for the man, and sensed his genuineness. Bottom line: for a guy who didn't bring much fan loyalty into ""Walk The Line,"" Cash's film biography, I found it tolerable.

WTL takes us from Cash's dirt-poor Arkansas roots, where a family accident left him, the ill-favored son, at the mercy of his alcoholic father's demeaning rage. In the Air Force, Cash started writing the songs (though from what impulse the film does not say) that later made him famous. Initially more dogged than talented, Cash got involved with the rockabilly music of the day, toured with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter. The film does a great job illuminating the touring scene in rock and roll's very earliest years. The finale, showing the making if Johnny's famous live album at Folsom prison, was the climax of the film, showing Johnny finally having mastered himself and having a rollicking good time among men who saw into his tortured soul.

ALERT! A few spoilers in this paragraph: WTL is chock full of clichs about making it in the arts: the intrepid hero who battles self-doubt, family antagonism and an industry that doesn't think he has what it takes; with guts and desire he masters his instrument and becomes a great success, only to lose his way in anonymous sex, pills, booze or dope; After hitting bottom, the love of friends and family help him face the demons of the past, get him cleaned up and move onto greater successes. WTL, like ""Ray,"" mines these familiar veins.

WTL is saved from mediocrity by a couple of factors. Joaquin Phoenix does a decent job portraying Cash. Sometimes he looks and acts very much like Cash, other times less so. It's hard, though to know whether he's playing a man who is painfully shy and not good with words, or one who is not that bright. Reese Witherspoon does a creditable job as June Carter Cash, though every now and then ""Legally Blonde"" peeks through. What really saves the film is the grit it took for Phoenix and Witherspoon to sing their own parts. With Johnny Cash, pure determination took over when all else failed. The leads were able to channel some of that energy into their roles.

If it was up to me alone, I'd give WTL 3 stars, but my wife (an Cash fan from way back) thoroughly enjoyed it, earning it one extra star.",1136332800,3,2412,4.602325581395349

Nothing could've been better. Everything, from the casting of Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings, to the Oscar-worthy performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, is absolutely exceptional in this movie. This beats Jamie Foxx's ""Ray"" by a lot.

Joaquin Phoenix brilliantly portrays the troubled Johnny Cash, in such a way that you feel for Mr. Cash. It makes you want to jump onto the screen, and throw Johnny's pill bottles away. Reese Witherspoon (though she is considerably prettier than June Carter was) does a wonderful job at her part. One of the most impressive things these two people did, was actually sing in the movie! Most actors who have to play rock stars have the music dubbed in, and just hope they can lip it well enough to look convincing. Well, I'm convinced. The singing sounded great, and I, being a music/movie obsessive and a Texas Pre-Area Bass 2, would know. Johnny Cash is pretty much the only country I listen to, him and Hank Williams, with an occasional Buck Owens tune.

I loved this movie. Oh, and how about a shout out to the rest of the cast! The two men playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley were hilarious, and the men playing Johnny Cash's ""Two Tennessee Men"" were great.

This movie beats Narnia, King Kong, and any other movie I've seen this year, and almost my whole near-15 years of existence. If you haven't seen it already, get up from reading this review, walk out of your door, get in your car, drive to the theater, and watch it. It's brilliant.",1135382400,6,1675,4.652027027027027

I don't know Johnny or June to much, the acting was good but not excellent. I thought Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as June though. The part that I rolled my eyes at was an almost minute scene with Johnny with Waylon Jennings, who was played by his son, Skeeter Jennings. I thought it was a little tacky and would have prefered to see someone play Bob Dylan. Plus forget to tell the story about Johnny kicking out the lights at the Grand Ol Opry. That would have been cool to see. Go see it for Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, other then that, a weak biography of the man in black.",1134864000,2,751,4.295774647887324
1609294,5,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix has come a long way since playing the mixed up porn toting child of divorce in ""Parenthood"" (watch him in ""Quills""). He has nailed the part of Johnny Cash and, quite feasibly, an Oscar.

Rather than try and cram his entire life in under 2 hours, WTL focuses instead on Johnny's early life (dysfunctional alcoholic father, tragic death of his beloved older brother Jack) and the gospel music his mother taught him. After joining the Air Force and eventually returning from Germany, Johnny marries Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin)and quickly has his first child. But Johnny can't make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. After seeing Elvis through the back door of a local recording studio, Johnny gets the idea to form his own band and make a record- and the rest of his career is history.

Oddly enough, this film isn't as much about Cash's career as it is a beautiful love story between him and June Carter, played superbly by Reese Witherspoon. From a nearly decade long addiction to ampetamines to a bitter divorce from Vivian, Cash survives it all and pursues June single mindedly until the refusals to his marriage proposals become an acceptance. It's no wonder Cash died just three months after his beloved June passed away- their connection ran deeper than friendship or marriage- they truly were soulmates.

Other than the obvious subject matter (famous singer overcoming personal problems) another comparison is the fact that they both boast great award worthy performances. I hope Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon definitely get recognition for the amazing work in this film. Joaquin gave a very complex performance and he had strong presence. Reese was definitely glowing on the screen. Just from the portrayal of June Carter, I could easily see why Johnny (and me for that matter) would be drawn to her. Reese portrays a strong woman who can brighten up others around her.

 Aside from the acting; the direction, production design, and editing is also very accomplished. I wouldn't hesitate calling this one of the year's best picture.",1134691200,4,995,4.847058823529411
1609296,5,B00005JO1R,"Even though my father is a huge fan of Johnny Cash, I didn't really start to appreciate the man's genius until the last couple years I was in college. That's when I began to see and understand how great a performer and singer Johnny Cash was. The more I learn about the man and his life, the more I am drawn to him. Cash was a man whose music was able to cross all kinds of boundaries: rich and poor, minorities and white people, good citizens and those in jail. His songs (many of his most popular tunes he didn't write) touched people where they were.  They were rooted in the toil of daily living and in the grit and grind of humanity.

WALK THE LINE is an excellent biopic about one segment of The Man in Black's life. The movie is not a full-fledged biography. Instead, it is a shorten tale of Cash's life that tells of the love story between John R. Cash and one June Carter.

The movie opens with Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) preparing to go on stage at Folsom County Prison to make his comeback (which all the record producers say is impossible to do at a prison). He sees a table saw and is taken back to when he was a child growing up in rural Arkansas. The childhood segment does a couple of important things for the story line. One, it shows that even as a child Cash had an infatuation with June Carter (he listens to her and her family on the radio all the time and stares at her pictures in magazines).  Secondly, it shows that from an early age, Cash knew pain--pain which made him sing like no other, but which also eventually led to his addiction to pain killers.

The movie flashes ahead from Cash's childhood to his brief stint in the service until he finally returns home and marries his sweetheart.  Cash is a man of vision, but his wife Vivian (played by the lovely Ginnifer Goodwin) wants John to give up his dream and settle down. Through perseverance and a lot of luck, Cash and his band have the opportunity to perform for Sam Phillips, the legendary owner of Sun Records who discovered not only Johnny Cash but Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis as well. Suddenly, Cash becomes a big star.

However, the higher his star rises, the more mixed-up becomes his personal life. Wife Vivian is just not happy with Johnny on the road so much. Johnny becomes more and more addicted to pain killers and alcohol and his childhood infatuation with June Carter turns into full-fledged grown-up love, tinged with a lot of lust.  June Carter knows better and though she connects with Cash, she knows that until he gets his act together they can't be together. The movie follows the relationship between these two until they are eventually married after an on-and-off again courtship of almost decades.

The acting in WALK THE LINE is some of the finest in any film this year. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a higher pitched voice than many, does an excellent job of recreating the essence of Johnny Cash's tone and timber (though the real Cash had a deeper baritone/bass).  Reese Witherspoon should be able to put to rest forever all those critics who said she was nothing more than a pretty face who had no talent because as close as Phoenix is to Cash, Witherspoon seems like a cloned version of a young June Carter. The two stars aren't the only ones to shine, because the supporting cast is just as good.

The overall tone is somewhat serious because as much as this is a love story, it is a love story about two people who lived really screwed up lives (don't we all?).  That's one of the reasons the movie (like Cash's music) is so powerful; it's real and honest and can touch people where they are.

Cash purists can find many faults with the film. There are points that some dramatic liberties are taken. Some characters are only represented one-sided. At times the film moves slow. Despite all this, none of these things really takes away from the film or from the life of Johnny Cash. Instead, the movie augments The Man in Black and illustrates why he was able to become admired by so many and a legend in his time.",1134518400,5,4018,4.450340136054422
1609297,4,B00005JO1R,"It seems biographies of well known figures of the twentieth century have become an ever increasing source material for high drama (Ray, Beyond the Sea).  Singer and songwriter Johnny Cash and his true love June Carter are realized by some honest, heartfelt performances and vivid period settings in Walk the Line.  Directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) from a screenplay by himself and Gill Dennis, the film draws material from autobiographies The Man in Black and Cash: An Autobiography.

An impending concert by Johnny Cash at Folsom State Prison is the point the story begins as it flashes back to 1944 in the South where the struggling Cash family works on a plantation.  As a young boy, Johnny idolizes his older brother Jack and wishes for something special in life.  Their mother gives Johnny the love for singing hymns while their father (Robert Patrick) is an alcoholic, stern figure.  When tragedy strikes the family, an emotional, dark cloud hangs over Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) through the years even as he serves military duty in Germany and begins to find solace in writing music.  He marries his sweetheart, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), and the two have a family and struggle to stay afloat financially while Johnny tinkers with gospel music and forms a trio.  When a fateful audition starts badly, he reverts to his more personal, angry music, and the rest is history.  Johnny begins cutting records, dressing in his fabled black outfits, and touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Cash begins an infatuation and life long obsession for June who is also married at the time.  Before long, Cash develops a dependency on drugs with unfortunate results.  His career at a crossroads and his home life a shambles, he descends into a self-destructive path with only June Carter as his true love and salvation.

Let's face it, the reason for seeing this film is to see how good the performances are by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they deliver the goods. There is definitely chemistry between the two especially in their duets as both of them show vocal abilities by singing their own songs (as in films like Coal Miner's Daughter and The Buddy Holly Story).  It would require a strong actor to play a legend, and Phoenix proves to be adept.  He gets his vocals in a deep, low range to the point you are convinced that he is young Johnny Cash!  Kudos should also go to Witherspoon who also shows a gift for warbling with a country twang and acting all at once, not a feat to be taken lightly.  Goodwin shines in her moments as the first Mrs. Cash, and it's a shame we don't see more of her in the film.

The concert scenes are restaged with authenticity while simultaneously involving us with fluid close-ups and sharp cutting.  It's nice to hear some famous songs recreated for today's audience.  Even if you weren't a fan, the songs strike a memory chord regardless.  Like Ray, Walk the Line shows how familial loss can have a lasting impact creatively and emotionally.  The story manages to move ahead a few years at a time and important moments are rendered realistically.  It is amusing in these pop music biographies to see a Who's Who of Rock n' Roll greats in their career infancies.  Just seeing Cash pal around with the likes of Lewis, Presley, and others is fascinating.  A lot of ground is covered in a little over two hours, but it doesn't feel too episodic.

What the film captures successfully is the affect that his music had on prison inmates and how an overwhelming amount of his fan mail was attributed to prisoners who felt that he spoke to them.  (Watch for a cameo by co-producer James Keach as the prison warden.)  Cash was a man of the people, and the film takes great pains to show that Cash was not perfect and in fact very human.  He succumbs to the temptations of female groupies, gets addicted to drugs, goes to prison, and shows peculiar behavior as he obsesses with June.  Although he was smitten with her, Cash was instrumental in getting June into the spotlight to do solos and to stand equal with him.

The film's momentum bogs down during Cash's downfall but redeems itself with scenes such as the Thanksgiving dinner in which Johnny confronts his father.  Among the movie's few flaws is the failure to develop the strained relationship between Cash and his intimidating father (well played by Patrick), and the resolution of the film with its family reunion doesn't ring true as one would have liked.  There is an amusing scene with June and her family scaring off a drug dealer who is trying to see Johnny.  More scenes like that would have been welcome.

There will naturally be constant comparisons with Ray, but that shortchanges a film that would shine in any year.  OK, Ray might be a tad better and Coal Miner's Daughter is the gold standard, but Walk the Line does just fine and Phoenix is terrific.",1134518400,,4927,4.735052754982415

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter.  I think Joaquin Phoenix is just a terrific actor, and Reese Witherspoon really impressed me with this role (I never liked any of her other movie performances).  This movie was enjoyable and I'm really glad I went to see it.  Having said that, I didn't walk away feeling like it was this AWESOME movie.  It sort of had a ""formula"" feel to it, I guess.  I did enjoy this more than Ray, but I suspect it's because I'm more familiar with Johnny Cash than I am with Ray Charles, and I'm a bigger fan of Phoenix than I am of Jamie Foxx.  All in all, this was a good movie.  I wish there was a little more singing, but I still enjoyed it.",1134518400,,880,4.135294117647059

If I say I enjoyed the film and learned something, then there will always be the ""experts"" who will say how much the movie got wrong or how some things were emphasized at the expense of other, perhaps more important, things. So all I'm going to say is that I enjoyed watching this film, and I think Joaquin and Reese did a great job ""impersonating"" Johnny and June. I've never been a fan of Cash, but I liked listening to the songs here, and I wanted more singing. The romance between Johnny and June, with all its warts and faults, was touching as well. Even ""bad, messed up"" people (i.e. people who make lots of stupid mistakes) can work things out, it seems.",1134432000,,707,4.363636363636363
1609350,5,B00005JO1R,"Wow, I didn't expect this kind of autobiographical story to be such a hit on the big screen, I had heard it was good, so when my brother invited me to the movies I went and was not disappointed.  I'm not a big country fan, and to be honest, I'd never even heard of June Carter, so I don't think it's the music link that necessarily makes this movie work so well.

That isn't to say the music wasn't first rate and really made the movie flow and there were also some great scenes showing a young Elvis and other stars that toured with Cash when he was first starting out and met Carter (played wonderfully by Reese Witherspoon).  All the acting and singing was great.

The real story here is a love story, and unfortunately it also includes lies, adultery, drug use and horrible neglect of ones children.  Life is pain, I believe Scott Peck said that, or something similar, and this movie really shows life as pain.  Never the less, there is redemption too for without it no story would be worth much.

There is no reason to get into all the arguments one can make as to why Cash's relationship with Carter was wrong when it started out, he was married and had children, however, before a judgment can be made all the facts need to be known, and here at least, in this film, we are only given a glimpse.  What we do see, however, and perhaps that's the story Cash really wanted us to see when he wrote his story (which was used to write the screen play) is that June Carter loved Cash and her love rescued him from a life of self imposed hell inflicted in many ways but most prominently through the abuse of pills.

This next couple of sentences contain a couple of scenes from the movie, minor but perhaps spoilers, so skip if you'd like, anyway, I really thought the scene in which June takes John back to church was moving and it spoke volumes, it was very brief, however, in some way, it made the movie all tie together.  The other short but important telling scene, I only wish I could believe it really happened (perhaps I need to read the book and see) is when Cash is recovering and the Carter family confronts the drug dealer with shot guns.  I'd like to think that scene was real and I'd wish we'd see more of that today.  In any case, that kind of loving friendship was what June offered Johnny and that's why this movie is really a great love story (in spite of the horrible back story and what is I'm sure still lingering pain in the children he had with his first wife).

All that said, I highly recommend this movie, go see it on the big screen.",1134345600,4,2559,4.295218295218295

Joaquin puts on a performance of a career and is a lock for the Best Actor nomination (with all the talk Hoffmans getting for Capote I doubt Phoenix will win, but he WILL be nominated) and Witherspoon is PERFECT as June Carter, almost even more perfect in her role than Joaquin was that her nomination may result in a win.

1609353,5,B00005JO1R,"From the opening moment when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) stares reminiscently at a saw blade, ""Walk the Line"" goes for the heart as it paints a vivid portrait of the Man in Black and woman, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) who saved his life.  The films' biopic clichs (drugs and darkness to redemption, divorce to true love, unreasonable christian guilt to transcendent peace) aren't what do it, but the dynamic and deeply felt acting of Phoenix and Witherspoon.  The chemistry these two achieve, aided immeasurably by director James Mangold and music guru T-Bone Burnett, is magnetic.  Phoenix reflects Cash's demons and scarred soul, his eyes stark windows into Cash's wounded but then redeemed heart.  And Reese Witherspoon is dynamite as the sassy and strong-willed June Carter, who dealt with her own marital difficulties as she fell for the man who had her at ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""  The pair own the movie.  However, they owe two supporting players a load of credit.  Robert Patrick is terrific as Cashs' uncaring father, matching Phoenix blow for blow in a pivotal thanksgiving scene where long held resentments stemming the death of Cash's older brother simmer up to the surface.  And Gennifer Goodwin as Cash' first wife is stellar as well, playing the woman who bore the brunt of Cash's drug abuse and infidelity.  A biopic that resonates, ""Walk The Line"" sticks with genuine emotion.  Hand over the Oscars now.",1134172800,2,1427,5.034042553191489
1609354,2,B00005JO1R,"Johnny Cash is the only country music performer I like.  I have five of his CDs.  Ever since I heard about WALK THE LINE, it was at the top of my Must Do list.  However, this movie seems like a deliberate attempt to assassinate his reputation.  It dwells on all of his negative aspects without truly letting his better qualities shine.

First off, there's the question of Joaquinn Phoenix.  For comparison's sake, let's realize that any actor taking on the role of a real and phenomenal man or woman is facing a daunting challenge.  We already have certain images burned into our brains.  We have seen, heard, and read about these people.  That being said, George C. Scott was Patton.  Denzel Washington was Malcolm X.  Jamie Foxx was Ray Charles.  Joaquin Phoenix was ... a pretty good imitation of Johnny Cash.  He never quite sounds like Cash, and he never quite establishes Cash's commanding presence.

Second, Cash was no angel, and this aspect of his character is in the movie.  However, it's most, if not all, of the movie.  His womanizing, his drinking, and his drug addiction are all there.  But where is his struggle to become a singer?  Where is his struggle to master music itself?  Judging by this movie, Cash pretty much was a master singer and musician from the first moment he attempted both.

Third and most importantly, when the time came to turn his life around, according to the movie, the decision to do so was made by other people.  The will to achieve his transformation also came from others.  He was just along for the ride, without any determination of his own.

On the positive side, Reese Witherspoon becomes June Carter.  Also, unlike RAY, we see the negative affects on others from Cash's self-destructive behavior.  The problem is that by the end of the movie, Cash has been portrayed as a man of unsubstantial courage, unsubstantial will, unsubstantial intellect, and unsubstantial compassion.  He's little more than an Arkansas hick with money.

I have no doubts that Joaquin Phoenix will win an award for his performance, and the film itself will win awards, because that's the kind of thing Hollywood likes:  People who can't do anything for themselves and who must let others straighten them out.  Unfortunately, there's a depth to Cash's music that is not attainable by the person portrayed in this film.",1134172800,6,2341,4.811557788944723
1609355,2,B00005JO1R,"Loved the music in this movie and went to see it expecting to really love the movie...but I was unimpressed. Good acting but the story was just another star on drugs and recovering.

I was also distracted by the unfortunate scar on Phoenix's face. I know he can't help it but it was very distracting to me watching ""Johnny Cash"".

My assessment will be in the minority but I didn't come out of this movie thinking ""gee, great acting"" ""wow, inspirational story"". When I came out my thoughts were, I'm glad I saw it and glad it is over except I may buy the CD. I won't buy the DVD.",1134086400,7,579,4.254545454545455
1609356,1,B00005JO1R,"Seeing this movie left me disappointed.  The most disappointed I have been about a movie in a long time.

Johnny Cash did great music, writing, performance, everything.  The half-assed performances of his songs in this movie are a disgrace.  The actors otherwise did a good job, but remake this thing and lip sync it.

Aside from the bad remake of the music there were some long dry spots that made me wish I was somewhere else.

If you are looking for a movie that honors Johnny Cash, look somewhere else.",1134086400,7,506,4.566666666666666
1609357,5,B00005JO1R,"Haunted by memories of a tragedy from his dirt-poor childhood, he struggles in the music industry until he finds his niche and releases on the world a new, incendiary sound that mixes genres and redefines boundaries, all while battling drug addiction and searching for a woman who will make him feel whole.

But enough about the Ray Charles movie, let's talk about Walk the Line.

Johnny Cash is brought to life on screen by Joaquin Phoenix, whose performance out-Foxxes all recent depictions of true-life characters. Phoenix's portrayal finds strength in the actor's ability to pay just enough attention to looking and sounding like Cash without letting it overwhelm him. Other ""transformations"" of celebrities (Foxx's Charles, Blanchett's Hepburn) seem to be more akin to a Darryl Hammond impression on SNL, as they focus on mimicking the person's mannerisms and end up losing their own humanity.

Playing Cash requires Phoenix not only to sing (which Foxx did not), but also to love someone so deeply that the absence of her love drives him to self destructive practices. In the song that leant its title to this film, Cash tells us he keeps a close watch on his heart. He builds walls and drapes himself in black, keeping the world away. While Phoenix captures this stand-offish outward presentation of Cash, he also opens him up, exposing the singer's vulnerabilities. The mysterious Man in Black loves. He cries. He lives.

June Carter (Reece Witherspoon) haunts the first hour of the film. She is ever-present in Cash's life, but out of his reach; he listen to her on the radio as a young boy and reads about her first marriage while stationed in Germany. Clearly, the film's central story is their love, told from Johnny's point of view. Once June becomes a steady force in the film, the narrative moves from being the story of Johnny Cash to their courtship. Witherspoon brightens her scenes with a perky energy that masks an inner turmoil equal to Johnny's. On stage, Witherspoon bests Phoenix (a major feat, as he is fantastic) and has a career in country music if this acting thing doesn't work out.

Walk the Line's supporting characters read like a Who's Who of 1950s music. Elvis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, etc. The two scene-stealing performances belong to unknown actors (unknown to me) playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Sun Records proprietor Sam Phillips. Phillips' first meeting with Cash provides the heart of the film, as he tells the young musician to sing as if he only has the chance to sing one song for the rest of his life. Phillips is rightly presented as a man who nurtured many young musicians and helped them find the voices that spoke to the masses.

My only criticism of the film is criticism I have for most biopics. I expect more from a film than just giving an account of someone's life (Ray, Ali, Man on the Moon). Those stories should be reserved for made-for-tv movies. Walk the Line has great ambitions when concerning the presentation of the material, but a lot of compromises are made on content. Much of the story-lines are clichd, as real life has been heavily sculpted to fit a conventional drama (I seriously doubt Cash's father and first wife are as one-dimensional as presented).

But Walk the Line does not have the goal of competing with most other dramas. Primarily, it wants to remain faithful to the love story of Johnny and June Carter Cash and present their lives' work in a way that will entertain modern audiences as much as the toe-tappers who listened to them half a century ago. With those goals in mind, this film could not be improved in any way.",1133654400,,3604,4.793880837359098
1609378,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" tells the story of country music star Johnny Cash from his early days until his marriage to June Carter in 1968. Joaquin Phoenix is terrific, capturing the mannerisms and singing style of Cash as well as any actor possibly could. Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as well. Her June Carter is a spunky, intelligent young woman who finally manages to provide Cash the solid grounding that he so desperately needs.

I especially enjoyed the scenes of Johnny's childhood. The movie really captures the simplicity and hardship of life in rural Arkansas at this time. This boyhood period also includes the tragic death of his older brother, Jack. Johnny's guilt over not being there to save his brother from a sawmill accident provides the psychological background for much of what happens later in the movie.

The film's most prominent musical focus is on Cash's early days as a rockabilly artist, hanging out with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and the boys. It's worth remembering that Johnny was a rebellious, young rocker before later returning to his country music roots. It was during these days that he first met and fell in love with June Carter. But she was newly divorced and he was still unhappily married. So they remained ""only friends"" for many years before admitting their passion and love for one another. But by this time Cash had become addicted to pharmaceutical drugs and June realized a successful marriage would be impossible. Finally, with the help of June and the Carter family, Johnny is able to quit taking the pills and get his life back on track. But, the now twice divorced, June is reluctant to marry again despite Johnny's desperate pleading. I found the ending, where June finally accepts Johnny's marriage proposal on stage to be improbable and a bit cheesy. But if that is how it really happened then that's how it had to be filmed.

Overall ""Walk the Line"" is a terrific film about two extraordinary people. The music is great and if you are a Johnny Cash fan you will love listening to it. Highly recommended.",1133568000,3,2048,4.796033994334278

My Parents didn't believe it was Phoenix singing.  At first I questioned the voice too but then realized that Phoenix sounds better than Cash.

1609380,5,B00005JO1R,"MOVIE: James Mangold takes us into the formulaic yet satisfying life of the great Johnny Cash. Like all biopics, we have the protagonist who has had a troubled past and overcomes his inner demons to finally get his life back on track. It's pretty much the same senerio for every musical artist. Joaquin Phoenix gives one helluva performance as Cash, and he does it with his eyes. During the musical scenes when Pheonix is performing, you can't help but just stare into his eyes that give off the emotional state that he is singing in. The film is told as a flashback, and we start in Cash's childhood where he suffers the loss of his brother in a tragic accident. His father screams out loud that the devil took the wrong son, and that fuels the troubled past that haunts Cash as an adult. We've all heard the story before, whether it be Cash's story or any other singer/songwriter's. He gets his big break and makes a record, starts touring, falls in love with the lovely Reese Witherspoon who playes June Carter to perfection, uses drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of his past, conquers his problems, and comes to accept life and starts to live it. While it may seem formulaic, the film itself is a fascinating and emotional watch. It's very much like this year's Cinerella Man, a film that is totally formulaic but still brilliantly executed. Mangold, while he has no visual style, does provide a consistent direction for the film that doesn't lose the focus of the audience. The musical scenes are breathtaking and it's all thanks to the brilliant acting. What is even more impressive is that no V/O work was done. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all their own singing, which always adds to the authenticity. The film is a great experience for movie goers, and you'll probably find yourself with a few Johnny Cash tunes on your ipod afterwards.

ACTING: Oscar nods for both Phoenix and Witherspoon are going to happen, the performances were absolutly stunning and just incredibly amazing, did I mention the acting was good? Phoenix won't win the Oscar for this one though, I just don't see the Academy giving it to Foxx for Ray last year and now for another musical biopic. Golden Globe? Definately not out of the question.

BOTTOM LINE: A story we've all heard before, but it always feels fresh when it's done well. In this case it was done extremely well, the movie was great.",1133481600,4,2380,4.664285714285715

1609382,5,B00005JO1R,"2005 was a lackluster year for films. There were very few movies that were really knockouts. The one standout film for the year was ""Walk the Line,"" the Johnny Cash bio-pic.

In an era when films are full of darkness and lack good, quality storytelling, ""Walk the Line"" was a glimmer of hope. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Man in Black is startling, proving that he is one of the most versatile actors in hollywood. There were a few times when I thought that it really was Cash up there, and not an actor. Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. She plays here as both a spit-fire and a compassionate friend who saves Cash from....well, Cash. It's these two performances that give the film it's soul, and the fact that the two stars did all their own singing makes it a very impressive film. The supporting cast, such as Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, and Dallas Roberts as Sam Phillips, are solid.

The 2-Disc Collector's Edition for the film is a must-have for Cash and movie collectors. The extras are excellent, including a featurette about Johnny's historic concert at Folsom Prison, where he emerged as the Man in Black.

""Walk the Line"" is an exceptional film with fantastic acting, fine storytelling, and excellent music that will have your toes tapping before the end. I highly recommend this film for fans of Cash, and for movies buffs as well.

1609383,3,B00005JO1R,"I will probably write a minority review here. This biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix as the famous country singer, Johnny Cash looked very much like a clone of last year biopic, Ray. We got the same theme here, poor upbringing, childhood guilt trip, drug addiction, making it big and losing his family at the same time and the both films end around the same time period, never going into their mature years. Only major differences between the two movies were the color of their skin and sound of their music. The major reason why this movie wasn't an one star movie for all this copycat format was that Reese Witherspoon gave a real fantastic performance as June Carter. While Joaquin Phoenix was good, I didn't think he was great. Witherspoon proves to totally effective and she virtually overshadowed Phoenix in almost every scene they were together. She brought this movie up to a high level by her performance which I thought to be authentic, well interpret and settled. While this may sound bit unfair to Phoenix since he had the hardest job of capturing Johnny Cash without mimicking him, I thought he didn't do that good of job. Maybe the script let him down on that issue.

Both of them were well supported by their fellow cast members. The music production was very good and it told the musical story very well. But the script was bit on the weak side. Movie seem to go from episode to episode, home scene to music scene and so on. What made Johnny Cash tick? What were his motivations? Answers seem very superficial here. There just wasn't any major surprises in the movie and although my knowledge of Johnny Cash came from only one book and two CDs, I didn't see him too well on the movie screen.

Outside of Witherspoon's superb performance, this movie is basically by the number routine. Isn't there a music star out there who didn't have poor upbringing, who didn't have some sort of childhood guilt trip, who wasn't a drug or alcohol abuser and didn't lose his family when he made it big???",1133308800,8,2003,4.6394366197183095

Joaquin Phoenix does all his own singing which impressed me very much. I went out and bought the CD Soundtrack to Walk the Line. His presence on the screen is captivating. I recommend you watch this movie if you enjoy love stories, country music, any music, and just to watch the riveting performances of Joaquin and Reese.

1609385,5,B00005JO1R,"Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give impressive performances in this story of Johnny Cash and his long-time  love, June Carter.  Johnny grew up poor on a cotton farm, listening to June Carter and her family sing on the radio.  He married a girl from home, worked as a door-to-door salesman, and started singing, but his wife was jealous of Johnny's career and his time away from home.  He met June and was smitten, but they were both married; they continued to tour together for years, through June's second marriage and Johnny's terrible drug abuse.  June helped him kick his habit and later, Johnny proposed to her onstage.

I really enjoyed the songs in the movie a lot; I was especially impressed that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing and playing and made it look so easy.  Phoenix's Johnny is a tortured and self-destructive soul, and Witherspoon's June is spunky, kind, and mature. This is surely the best movie for both of them to date.  They have great romantic chemistry on-screen and their close-ups are intense! The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Robert Patrick as Johnny's mean and unrepentant father.  I heartily recommend ""Walk the Line;"" it is an emotional roller-coaster of highs and lows, with a lot of entertaining music and two very likeable stars.

1609387,4,B00005JO1R,"Film biographies are always a bit tricky, in my opinion.  I always find myself wondering which parts are ""true"" and which parts are rearranged, condensed, combined, etc.  For example, in WALK THE LINE, there's a terrifically dramatic scene near the end when Johnny Cash proposes to June Carter.  The circumstances of the proposal are almost TOO perfect, from a storytelling / dramatic standpoint.  Did it really happen that way, or did the filmmakers take liberties because the truth would have been less cinematically interesting?  At least, when I watch fiction, I know it's all made up.  And when I watch ""non-fiction"", I know liberties will be taken...I just don't know where.

That aside, WALK THE LINE is a pretty satisfying film bio.  First of all, Joaquin Phoenix is terrific.  He doesn't really look like Cash...I always thought Cash was a big man...Phoenix is not.  But we forget these surface dissimilarities almost right away, because Phoenix embodies the character in more important ways.  He creates a full-blooded character.  And the fact that he sang the songs himself is pretty amazing.  Again, his voice isn't a dead-on copy (he can't quite as low as Cash), but there are enough times when a particular phrase comes out EXACTLY like we remember that the viewer is completely satisfied.  It was great to hear some older Cash songs that I had forgotten I knew.  Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter, gives her best dramatic performance yet.  She has one great scene when she is shopping in a small general store in some town they are touring through.  First, she meets some admiring fans and her manner in being perfectly lovely to them while still cutting their conversation short is terrific, and moments later, she is confronted by a clerk who heartily DISAPPROVES of June's recent divorce...and Reese's face is wonderful to watch.  We see her shame and a smidge (just a smidge) of anger...and her response (well written, but REALLY well delivered) is great.  This is a time before everyone went around being sarcastic / ironic, and her reply is genuine and non-ironic and painful and totally appropriate.  There are times in the film when Reese's generic ""perkiness"" comes through a bit more than I would like...but overall, she's quite solid.  Phoenix should certainly get an Oscar nomination...Witherspoon is slightly less deserving, in my opinion, but I wouldn't put up a fight if she did get nominated.

One thing I really like is that the film plays out a lot of its drama right on stage.  The concert scenes are fabulously believable.  There's great singing and playing of great music, there's totally believable banter (I don't mean the banter is believable...it's totally ""staged"" for the audiences, but it feels exactly like what would have been delivered to audiences of the `50s & early `60s) and there's a LOT of subtext being played out.  Whether it's the looks Johnny gives to June as she waits off stage, or their chemistry when they sing together...you almost get all you need to know about their relationship by how the shows go.  When Johnny reaches rock bottom with drug use...we see it on stage.  When he's totally enamored of June, we see it on stage.  I love that the film makes this choice with its storytelling.

I also want to mention a great supporting turn by Robert Patrick (X-FILES, TERMINATOR 2) who plays Cash's father.  I don't think his part has Oscar written on it...it's not that showy.  But Cash's father has a HUGE influence on Johnny, and Patrick plays him strongly enough that we can palpably feel how Johnny is affected by him.  It's a critical role, and Patrick nails it.  After TERMINATOR 2, his roles on film haven't always been the best.  I hope this gets him some juicier material...Agent Doggett will always have a soft spot in my heart.

The movie isn't perfect.  I felt the Folsom Prison concert was just a bit of a dramatic letdown.  Yes, this is a famous album and famous moment in Cash's career, but the film tries to make an awful lot of it, and then they don't actually show us much of the show.  Also, the inevitable closing titles, when we are told in a few superimposed words about the rest of Johnny and June's lives are quite brief and uninformative.  Those two went on to rather amazing careers for another 30+ years.  The care and devotion they were shown in the film is quickly tossed aside in a few glib summary statements.  I think everyone in the audience would have happily sat and read a bit more...especially with some great Cash music in the background.  But these quibbles aside, it's a very entertaining movie and I would give it about 4.25 stars.",1133222400,3,4634,4.791929382093317

1609441,5,B00005JO1R,"I saw the movie last night and enjoyed it as much as any movie I've seen in a long time. However, my enjoyment must be tempered with the fact that I have been an admirer of Cash from the beginning. I first saw him in concert in Montreal in 1969 which by the way,was a tour where he brought along The Statlers. I have most of his music and have read a number of books about him. He was a legend at that time and already had most of his hard times behind him,but his legend continued to grow right up to the end.
  Being a Country Music fan for 60 years,I have had a lot of favourites but when all's said and done Cash, in my opinion, is the best of the best;and there have been a lot of great artists
over the years. There is nobody that even comes close,except maybe Hank Williams Sr. but the fact that his life was cut so short at 29,and Cash 's lasted so much longer,makes the difference. Even Cash,as great as he was,never accomplished as much in any short period as did Williams. To me, it's unimaginable what Williams would have done if he had lived as long as Cash.
  All that said and done,how does one tell the story of Johnny Cash in a 2 hour movie or even a book? The answer is simply,you can't.
  What this movie does, is give a snapshot of his youth,a brief glance at his Air Force days,a quick summary of the early days at Sun Records,then a fairly detailed look at his interest in and proposal of marriage to June Carter. How exactly true the details are really don't matter much. The bottom line is that June Carter was the strength that held JR together and gave him the will to continue and become the great success that he was. The foundation of that strengh was faith and love. We saw it blossom and show itself all through the years;but never more on display than when together they sang ""Jackson"",way back in those days portrayed in the movie, as well as every time they appeared over the years.
  The movie ends with June accepting John's proposal during a concert at Massey Hall,here in Toronto. Although one might argue,I believe that was the real beginning of Cash becoming
the legend he did. Had June not been there for John,he might well have mirrored the the destruction of Williams.
  So,what this movie does,rather than tell the whole life and times of Johnny Cash,it centers in on that brief period where Cash was on the edge of perdition,things could have gone either way,and probably the wrong way,and it was the union of June and John that tipped the scales.
  This movie is excellent in showing the single factor that had the biggest inpact on John's life;not the songs he wrote,the concerts he performed,the causes he championed,the people he loved and helped,the image he portrayed;nothing comes close to the love they had for each other and their faith in God.
  If you are a fan of Cash,this is a movie you will not want to miss.",1133049600,,2868,4.396975425330813
1609442,5,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the line"" is one of the few films that had a lot of hype surrounding it that managed to surpass my expectations.  Upon first hearing that there was a Johnny Cash biopic film starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, I didn't really think much of it.  I thought they're just trying to ""cash"" in on the popularity of ""Ray"" from last year.  And the actors!  I couldn't really picture Phoenix and Witherspoon doing justice to Johnny and June.  While both are fine actors it really takes a special talent and can be really risky portraying country music legends such as Cash and Carter.  Then, I heard that ""Walk the line"" got good reviews from a number of critics.  And, my friends who saw it also spoke very highly of it.  After seeing it yesterday, I consider it the best movie of the year and worthy of oscar nominations.

The story focuses mainly on Johnny and June Carter.  There are alot of similarities in this film with ""Ray"", but the main difference is that the complexity of his relationship with June is shown more here as a saving grace than Ray's wife was.  The director allows this focus to give insight to how songs were written by both Cash and Carter.  It's interesting after hearing Cash and Carter's songs for so long to finally see the circumstances surrounding their lives which inspired them.

Phoenix and Witherspoon both give the performance of their careers.  Both their voices are amazingly accurate to the originals.  With Phoenix managing to hit all the right notes with a suprisingly almost perfect timbre, while Witherspoon sings well and even with a Carter-ish growl.  The chemistry these two posess between eachother makes it easy for the audience to believe Johnny's love for June as well as June's reluctance to marry Johnny for so many years.  Both deserve a nomination for best actor and actress, since they both nail their respective parts.  Out of the two, I think Phoenix is more likely to win an oscar because his portrayal of Johnny is so beleivable.  Johnny's vulnerability and wild side are portrayed with ease by Phoenix.  Phoenix has a talent for giving deep, probing characters with an emotional side and he not only does that but he seems to channel Cash through him and never once does the audience look at him and not think he is Cash.  Kudos to the rest of the cast but Witherspoon and Phoenix really make the film as well as the writers and director James Mangold.

""Walk the line"" is touching, powerful, and highly recommended!",1132963200,3,2487,4.708333333333333
1609443,2,B00005JO1R,"A good biography is hard to make. Here are some of the things I didn't like about this movie.

1- Struggle between man and woman relationship. This movie comprised too much of Reese Witherspoon's character. I would have preferred the focus remain on his music and the birth of his fame and events to follow.

2- I would have liked if the movie went beyond the 60's and looked at him in the 1980's and so forth.

3- I didn't think the father and son relationship was focused enough on and why did Johnny Cash not better defend himself against a heartless dad? His dad was not a good dad but he is not even in the middle of the picture, not until the end.

4- Reese Witherspoon , though a good actor, has become rather dull in her approach to acting and quite predictable. I was getting annoyed with her about mid way thru the script.

Sorry, but this movie isn't as good as those who "" walk the line"" say it is. Thanks.",1132963200,8,918,4.222857142857142
1609444,4,B00005JO1R,"It's hard to watch someone fighting their demons.  Harder still when your sense is that an actor is achieving that kind of believability on screen because he, too, demons that he struggles with.  Such is the feeling you get from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line"".  When Phoenix, as Cash, wakes up with his face in the dirt, wet and miserable from a walk to Carter's house (his car has been repossessed), you get the sense that Phoenix has been there in his own life.

Based primarily on John's autobiography, ""Walk the Line"" tells the story of John's life as a young adult, just learning to play the guitar, just breaking into song writing, just starting the tough road that was touring from place to place to place to endless place.  The tearing of a life as a husband and father with the endlessness of the road is portrayed, and the film traces Johnny's particular demons back to his childhood with the death of his beloved older brother, Jack, and the callousness of his father, a sharecropper named Ray Cash (Robert Patrick, the villain in Terminator II, in a steely portrayal).

Woven through the life on the road is John's growing love and obsession with June Carter.  A young veteran of road life, Carter was the daughter of Maybelle Carter, perhaps one of this country's finest female musicians.  June had toured and sung with the family Carter since she was a young girl.  A comedienne, Carter is portrayed as she has always been viewed....as a good and shining person, someone who could be held up to the light, someone who could help Johnny break away from the demons he ran into on the road, and during the lowest hiatus in his career.

This movie, although a pretty accurate biopic about Johnny's life, is really the love story between Cash and June....a love story finished out in the ensuing 35+ years of marriage.  There's amazing chemistry between Johnny and June on the screen, during their duets (""Jackson"" is amazing!), and while they are spinning in each other's orbit.  It must have been hard for Carter to come to terms with her feelings for such a troubled man.  In the film, this upheaval, as well as Johnny's demons could have been better portrayed by linking the songs they wrote to the events they were living.  (The script DOES look at the creative songwriting process and explore what the writer was doing when they wrote one song each....""Folsom Prison"" by Johnny and ""Ring of Fire"" by June).  She wrote the song that John made famous, but the Ring of Fire was all about the way she felt, falling in love with someone as dangerous as John could be, and all after she'd made two mistakes in marriage and twice had to go through divorce (divorce was such a swear word in the 50's and 60's!).  The Bible-thumping Christian community that was the backbone of the Carter family's audience, subtly let June know how they felt about this seeming recklessness in her own life.  This is beautifully portrayed in the film by an awkward moment between Witherspoon and a fan in a local store.  The woman seems friendly, but in a few words, cuts Carter's self esteem to ribbons with a reference to the sin of divorce.

In this film the director (James Mangold) lets the entire picture revolve around the characters' performances.  There is little symbolism, little depth in the story, just a telling of events.  An interesting character study with a look at some famous old musicians (Waylon Jennings, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, etc.) and how their lives were intertwined.  Phoenix and young actress Reese Witherspoon are inspired and inspiring in their portrayals. Phoenix has the sheen in his skin of a pill popping alcoholic...his look of exhaustion and hopelessness is gut wrenching.  He studied films of Johnny and has the strange stance of John holding a guitar...the smirk, the shoulder rolls, down to a science.  He IS Johnny Cash.  Witherspoon is a perfect counterpart - you sense her loyalty and her pull towards Johnny even when she is trying her hardest to be a good person.  Both stars sing very well.  The music is plentiful and stays with you long after you leave the theater...T Bone Burnett gives as much to the world with this musical collection as Phoenix does with his performance.  Even producer James Leach ( a personal friend of Johnny Cash) makes a cameo as the warden of Folsom Prison.

Like last year's ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"" is a vehicle for major performances, for career-changing roles by the actors, but, as a film, is somewhat flawed and bound by being a collection of events instead of a true story.  It's definitely worth a trip to the theater, but 5 star performances don't compensate for an underwhelming script.  4 stars.",1132876800,9,4689,4.723587223587224

1609446,5,B00005JO1R,"Growing up in South Dakota during the 50s and 60s I was immersed in Country and Western. Never a big fan, however I loved Johnny Cash. Like my father he served in the USAF; Like my father he was never around; Like my father he was self absorbed and drug dependent. Unlike my father, he met and was saved by the love of his life.

I admit to being annoyed when June Carter's warbling stole time from The Man I wanted to see and hear. To me it was like prempting The Beatles appearance on Ed Sullivan with Lawrence Welk. And their duets ... well picture Bobby Burgess dancing with John Lennon.

For me, Walk The Line was Ray in a string tie with one exception ... Reese Witherspoon. As much as June Carter added color and years to the life of Johnny Cash, Ms. Witherspoon brightens (and in my opinion, saves) the telling of yet another drug-addled performers life story.

I will always be deeply grateful to Ms. Carter for giving Johnny Cash a reason to live and perform. Likewise, audiences (and producers) for Walk The Line owe a debt of gratitude to Reese Witherspoon.

Without Ms. Witherspoon, Walk The Line would be a wonderful movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast. With Ms. Witherspoon, its a great movie.

It shows his highlights and his low times.  It doesn't hold back it doesn't try and show Johnny in a one deminsional light it shows him as human.

1609480,2,B00005JO1R,"Hollywood has been making biopic (biographical) films since the beginning of films.  At first, the biographies were overly positive.  ""The Pride of the Yankees"", ""The Charles Lindberg Story,"" even the post WWII movie ""The Desert Fox"" focused more on the positive aspects of Erwin Rommel, a German Field Marshal.  Eventually the genre changed to try to provide a deeper understanding of the person.  ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is the classic example; in that movie the viewer was exposed not to just what T.E. Lawrence did, but who he was.

Eventually these biopic films became much more honest, incorporating both the positive and the negative aspects of individuals.  This is fine; I don't want propaganda in biopic films.  It's fascinating to see the darker side of important figures.  It makes them much more real, and yet makes their accomplishments all the more spectacular.  The movie ""Ray"" epitomizes this balance.

""Ray"" was one of the best movies of the decade.  The story of Ray Charles put to the silver screen.  Audiences got a healthy dose of music, an incredible performance by Jamie Foxx, and a fair picture of the life of Ray Charles, including the low points and the high points.

""Walk the Line"" should be the same thing as ""Ray.""  It's a biography of a musical figure who had low points in his life.  But in execution, ""Walk the Line"" comes no where near the quality of ""Ray.""  Even in the genre of biographies this movie fails to live up to any standard.  Even if it were decided that Walk the Line should not be compared to ""Ray,"" it's still my conclusion that this film isn't worth the price of any admission.

Joaquin Phoenix does a good job portraying the enigmatic singer Johnny Cash; Reese Witherspoon shows her abilities playing the part of June Carter.  The movie looks good, each scene has good direction.  But this movie lacks any kind of spirit.  It has an almost flat reception.  In fact, a major part of the story, the romance between June Carter and Johnny Cash, is absent.  There is no chemistry.  It's not a love story at all.  Carter and Cash appear only as close friends.

The film focuses on ten years of Cash's life.  Ten dark years where Cash was ruled by an addiction to amphetamines and other drugs.  Ten years of strife with his first wife.  Ten years of adultery.  The movie hardly does justice to the life of Johnny Cash, it focuses more on the faults of Johnny Cash.  The goal of this movie was to destroy the memory of Johnny Cash.  It did not present a balanced view of the man's life.  It did not tell us of his origins.  There are few epiphanies.  The characters don't grow as people.  Cash is not presented as a deep character.  He's more or less portrayed as an antagonist.

The man who was Johnny Cash is not present in this film.  The film does not portray his recovery from drugs.  In an act of pure ""Christo-phobia"" the movie fails to show Johnny Cash answering an alter-call.  The movie was designed to destroy the man.  Cash's humanly faults become the movie, and the movie exaggerates those faults.  After watching ""Ray"" I had a better understanding, respect and empathy for Ray Charles. This movie leaves me no such feelings for Johnny Cash.  It fails as a biography, and it fails as a film.  It belongs to the ""Made for TV"" movie genre, not the silver screen.  Save your Cash and go elsewhere.",1132704000,10,3349,4.619047619047619
1609481,2,B00005JO1R,"I was expecting some depth to the love story between Johnny Cash and June Cash. But this is the story according to the movie: Johnny (previously J.R.) comes from a poor family with a very mean father who views his kids as being put on earth to work and slave for him. Johnny goes into the Air Force, begs his girlfriend to marry him (after they haven't seen each other for 2 years), then, once they are married, doesn't do much to support his family.  His love is music, and he becomes successful.  Someone offers him some sort of illegal pills, telling him ""Elvis takes them"", so he says sure, and becomes addicted in short order. Meantime, he cheats on the wife he was dying to marry with groupies and lusts after June Carter. Gets drunk and high, etc. His wife finally gets fed up with his hurtful betrayal and refusal to change, takes the kids and leaves.  June apparently has some sort of savior complex, because she keeps coming whenever Johnny needs her.  She refuses to marry him, but finally gives in when he swears he will stop hurting her as he has previously (after they're married, he sleeps with her sister, but they leave that part out).  What was so great about this guy as a marriage prospect, I couldn't figure out, but he was persistent, I'll give him that. One of those men who always wants what he can't have. And then once he has it, he doesn't want it anymore. In the film, Johnny's dad comes around frequently to make disapproving faces and remind him of his shortcomings, but Johnny is always too wasted to tell him to get lost, and lets his dad push his buttons every time.

Joaquin Phoenix does a pretty good job of looking drugged out and helpless most of the time, and Reese Witherspoon does a great job of acting classy, strong, yet vulnerable. However, there's no real chemistry between them and I just couldn't figure out what June saw in Johnny.

1609482,5,B00005JO1R,"This is a film for everyone, but especially for the Baby Boomers.  Baby Boomers lived through the career of Johnny Cash and will experience the feeling that they are seeing history in the making.  I know you should be quiet in the theatre, but I kept leaning over to my college-aged son and saying, ""I remember this."" and ""Do you know who THAT person is?"" etc.  Part way through the film, I stopped leaning over, because I was secretly wiping tears from my eyes.  This film is extremely powerful.  There are films you rent, and films you watch in the theatre, and films you plop down hard earned money for the privilege of owning.  This film is worth owning.

Now realize, these are the words of a Baby Boomer here.  My son is of a different generation.  As we left the theatre I asked him, ""Well, what did you think?""  His response, ""It's probably as good as Harry Potter.""  Wow!  I guess this may be a film for all ages.

1609483,4,B00005JO1R,"I must say that while I am not a Country Western music fan, I do love biopics if it's well made. The main appeal of Walk the Line for me is to see the performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon whom I have followed since Legally Blonde. I am not even familiar with any of Johnny Cash's music, and yet I was so dazzled by the singing of his songs done by Phoenix, especially that ""Ring of Fire"" song near the end. To my surprise, I was very taken by Phoenix' mesmerizing performance that actually moved me to tears during the time when his character was down and out and recovering from drug addiction. The love and marriage proposal scene was also very touching.

This film chronicles the early struggle and triumphs of Cash's life and career as a rebellious country musician in the '50s and '60s. He had three children with his first wife Vivian, but they got divorced dued to his wild and irresponsible behaviors. June Carter(Witherspoon) was the love his life, and it took many years before he pursuaded her to marry him. In the late '50s Cash was at the top of his game, but his drug addiction eventually caused the downfall of his career. His father(Robert Patrick in heavy makeup to look older) alienated him because he blamed him for the death of second son. It had casted shadows over Cash's life ever since. June and Johnny were the best musician duo/lovers and they were destined to become lifelong partners, despite the lack of social acceptances since they had been married to other people previously.

Both Withspoon and Phoenix did their own singing and were pretty convincing. It was very natural for Withspoon to deliver her lines in an authentic southern accent. Her June Carter rendition stole numerous scenes and it's certainly her most impressive performance to date. Too bad her role is more of a major supporting role, which limits her chances of getting an Oscar nomination in the best actress cateogory. As for Phoenix, he had obviously transcended the emotions from the death of his brother River into several of the scenes in this film which made it even more powerful and real.

1609485,3,B00005JO1R,"There is a moment in the new Johnny Cash Biopic WALK THE LINE that is so true and honest it stuck with me throughout the whole film. It's a moment that most people will forget, others will scoff and probably say ""look at that close-minded Bible-Thumper."" But I'll carry that moment with me for a long time. Judith Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is walking around a small five and dime. A former Southern Gospel Child star she has just gone through a horrible divorce. An old sweet women walks up to her and compliments her parents as being great Christians. After Carter thanks her for the sentiment. The old women spews the line ""Divorce is an abomination"" thus killing Judith with her down-home Christian Charm and in the process putting good ole James 3:9 into practical application ""With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.(James 3:9 NIV)

Working in Christian Radio I have come into contact with people like this. Hey I was once even accosted by a man in a collar because he didn't like the direction the station was going (and I didn't even make the decisions about that anyway.) But I also remember how easy it is to judge someone for their mistakes. It also allows me to have great admiration for June Carter and her family cause frankly this film allows them to show so much Christian love I'm embarrassed.

.....But before this review turns into a sermon allow me to tell you just what I think I of James Mangold's WALK THE LINE.

There are some people that are so complex, so multi-dimensional, that to try to sum their lives up in a few hours would be impossible. Johnny Cash is that kind of person. He was a man of faith, a man of sorrow, a man fighting his demons, and a man who had a gentle simplicity. When you saw him you thought he was easily figured out. WALK THE LINE tries and sometimes succeeds. Joaquin Phoenix stars as the Man In Black, and does a good job of becoming Cash. I didn't find myself looking at him and saying here's a guy trying to be someone he's not (earlier this week I sat through CAPOTE, and thought ""wow that's a great Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing Truman Capote, {in all honesty I was so bored by Capote I fell asleep in the middle of it so that's why there is no review}). It's a good performance because Pheonix tries his hardest to keep Cash grounded. Reese Witherspoon also controls June Carter-Cash with a live vivaciousness. She fills those shoes so well she almost steals the movie away from Pheonix and that's quite okay with me.

What doesn't work is a screenplay by Gill Dennis and Director James Mangold that is so difficult to nail down. It jumps from scene to scene because that's what it feels it needs to do. So while the performances are great, the film is too busy trying to play out events, instead of getting to the heart of the matter: WHO WAS JOHNNY CASH?. It gives us scenes with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and The Man in Black's troubles with drugs, but sometimes forgets that this is a film about a man. It's too pre-occupied with being a bio-pic and not about getting to the heart of the matter: WHO IS JOHNNY CASH? Why must bio-pics be so conservative? Why must we sit through another film about another celebrity that is too busy telling a story to care about the lead characters? (This was the problem with RAY last year. Again a film with great performances, but too preoccupied with getting the viewer from one momentous career moment to the other and not nailing done who RAY CHARLES, really was.) Johnny and June Cater Cash are people with lives far more interesting than this movie.

But then there is the music. T Bone Burnett has done it again. He captured the sound of the times. He nails down Cash's music quite nicely. If there is man out there batting a thousand producing soundtracks it's Burnett. From his work on the groundbreaking ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" to ""Cold Mountian"" he makes the music a character in the film. Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task. I just wonder why he chose to use Phoenix and Witherspoon's voice and not the CASH recordings themselves.

I also liked director Mangold's attention to detail. He has captured a changing America not with the turbulent events but with background details. This is a film about Cash, and I'm glad that he captured it that way. Many films take try to hard to pull us into the time period by saying ""alright here's the sixties cut to a group of hippies protesting Vietnam."" WALK THE LINE grounds itself by not making statements about society but by showing us Cash.

Then the film eventually ends with a pointless happily ever after moment that steals something from the films final analysis. It feels forced, and leaves us at a place that is too nice and peaceful. It felt like I was watching the end of Leave it to Beaver. Sheer badly paced schmaltz. I wished with film could have ended somewhere else. WALK THE LINE is a fine bio-pic, it has some brilliant acting. But it could have been so much better, CASH was larger than life and WALK THE LINE is too busy immortalizing Cash to let us know him. It's funny that, the small moment with June Cater and the old women struck me so much. It was the moment that felt honest? Who was Johnny Cash? WALK THE LINE doesn't really tell us.",1132617600,5,5375,4.489775051124744
1609486,4,B00005JO1R,"I have never been a big fan of country music, but Johnny Cash has always skated over music borders; maybe this is why I've always liked him and his music. I never knew anything substantial about his life or marriages or personal demons, but for most of my life, it's been his music that's saved his appeal for me!

I wasn't looking forward to the story/biography in this movie so much as I was the music. And even though I knew at first note, it wasn't the real Johnny doing the singing, it was close enough for me to enjoy those same songs over again. I can't verify the authenticity of the movie content, but I sure know those songs! I never knew Reese Witherspoon had such a singing voice, either.

Can you imagine sitting at the same show that featured Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley? I just wish I was able to see it at the time. Now that Johnny's gone, I cherish his music all that much more.",1132531200,,915,4.283236994219653
1609547,4,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" is a good film with very good performances.

Virtually every great artist has one thing in common. At some point in their life, they abused alcohol, drugs, the opposite sex, their lover(s), their children, themselves, friendships or a combination of any of the above. In many cases, they overcame these problems to go on and create even more outstanding work, cementing their reputations in history. For a few of these people, the problems proved too much, bringing a premature end to a promising life. Hollywood executives recognize that either scenario is pretty much guaranteed to help create an interesting film because each is inherently filled with drama. Therefore, it stands to reason that any biopic of a musician will feature the same element, the lead character overcoming an obstacle. Without this, the story wouldn't be as interesting.

Because we know that a biopic of a musician is going to feature a struggle, of some type, some of the inherent drama dissipates. It would, after all, be boring to watch a film about an artist who has a great life, no problems, everything is rosy. Fortunately, the last few musician biopics have married their familiar stories with great performances and good to great directing, enhancing our appreciation of their life. Last year's ""Ray"" features an outstanding performance by Jamie Foxx, who brings the character to life, with the aid of director Taylor Hackford.

If ""Walk the Line"", the new biopic about Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, were made a few years from now, there would be fewer comparisons to the Ray Charles film. But as it comes on the heels, comparisons are inevitable and will be plentiful.

Joaquin Phoenix does a good job of bringing singer Johnny Cash to life. He doesn't really attempt to imitate the icon as much as interpret his life. At times, especially when singing, Phoenix's voice attains the deep, resonant timber of Cash's, but he doesn't walk around mimicking throughout. This seems entirely natural. When he is performing, singing, his stage persona is different, selling himself as a character to his adoring fans.

At times, I found myself thinking ""Wow, Joaquin Phoenix is doing a good job."" More often than not, Phoenix was doing a good job acting. Phoenix acts, he doesn't become. Because we are pulled out of the performance like this, recognizing his work as an actor, he doesn't completely transform himself into the singer. Jamie Foxx managed this on a much more consistent basis, transforming himself into Ray Charles. He became the singer, losing himself in the mannerisms, speech and actions of the singer. In a way, Foxx was mimicking Charles, but he was doing this so completely and successfully he got lost in the character.

Remarkably, Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did all of their own singing and this is where Phoenix really shines. As mentioned, his voice reaches a deeper timber, reminiscent of the singer's and it is difficult to tell that it isn't Cash singing. I am not overly familiar with the Johnny Cash songbook, but when Phoenix sings, the signature tunes sure sound authentic.

Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, the love of Johnny Cash's life. I think people are generally much less familiar with her life and her work, so Witherspoon has a great deal more latitude in her performance, building a three dimensional character. Because she is able to more fully become ""June Carter"", her character is more successful. Witherspoon brings all of the facets of June's life to the screen; she conveys her conflicts with her religion when she gets divorced (for the first time), she conveys her friendship for Johnny, her ability to help him through his addiction, her onstage persona and more.

Reese Witherspoon also does her own vocals throughout. In Witherspoon's case, it is easier to tell that it is the actress singing. Her voice doesn't change and you recognize her accent throughout. I can honestly say I wouldn't recognize a song sung by the real June Carter Cash, so I have nothing to compare her vocal abilities to, but she also sounds good.

The two performances are very good, but it is strange that the actor portraying the less recognizable person should be more successful. Both actors are probably doing comparable work, but because we know more about Johnny Cash, recognize him as an icon, Phoenix has to work harder to make his performance seem interesting, believable and real. Ultimately, Phoenix does a better job with the singing and Witherspoon does a better job with her acting.

The film opens with inmates at Folsom Prison chanting and stomping their feet, trying to get Cash to come back from a break and continue the concert. As Cash pauses, trying to relax, he remembers back to his childhood. This is a fairly conventional setup for a biopic. Many recent film biographies wisely chose to depict only a portion of the subject's life, concentrating on this period, going into more depth. In ""Walk the Line"", the majority of the film tells the story of Cash's life from twelve year old cotton picker to his performance at Folsom Prison. The performance at Folsom provides a natural climax for the film and his story. And it is a great sequence, with Phoenix channeling the spirit of Johnny Cash, but the real point of this story is the romance between Johnny and June, so the film continues on for a bit until June finally agrees to marry Johnny. This is an interesting moment, and the two clearly loved one another, but the film really should've ended with the performance at Folsom. Continuing on, it seems anticlimactic.

Director James Mangold does a good, if unspectacular job with the material. Yes, everything looks good, but the film doesn't match the quality of the performances from the two leads. Mangold's work is a bit disappointing because the film is a really straightforward biopic. The director's previous work includes ""Identity"", a really underrated thriller with a twist, and ""Heavy"", his first film, also an underrated independent film. With the exception of the turkey ""Kate and Leopold"", Mangold's earlier work contains elements that help it rise above the pack. He has shown that he isn't content simply making a big budget studio picture. In ""Walk the Line""; he pretty much leaves the visual elements alone, photographing everything in a very straight forward and simple way. Everything looks good, but it doesn't contain any artistic flair.

Also, there are more than a few scenes involving Johnny, June and a number of other rising musicians touring on the same circuit. These rising musicians included Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. Jerry Lee Lewis is given the most screen time of the group and the actor playing him, Waylon Payne, seems to have a lot of fun bringing the outrageous musician to life. The remainder of the group sticks mainly to the sidelines, offering brief glimpses of them before and after they perform. Because we see so little of them, except for a few of the familiar iconic trademarks of Presley and Orbison, they seem to be almost cartoon characters, they serve as distractions, pulling us out of the story every time they appear. Cash says something to Elvis as they pass during a concert, then Cash stops to watch Elvis perform for a few moments. Then our attention is drawn to the audience is looking at Elvis on stage and the actor playing him. ""Oh, so he knew Elvis..."" At this point, it takes a few moments to get lost in the film again. It would have been better to actually never see these characters, maybe only catching glimpses of them, from the wings, or from behind, the bright stage lights obscuring their features.

A biopic should teach you something significant about the subject's life, something you didn't already know. Because ""Walk the Line"" is about two people, we should learn something about both of the characters. Ultimately, we learn more about June Carter, through Witherspoon's performance, partly because of the actor's work and partly because we know less about Johnny Cash's true love than we do about the iconic singer.",1132531200,,8110,4.936950146627566
1609548,4,B00005JO1R,"This movie holds up entirely because of the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  The best of part of those performances is the singing.  Most of us always knew Mr. Phoenix was a fine young actor and he doesn't disappoint in the least.  When I heard Reese Witherspoon was cast as June Carter, though,  I thought it was as silly as pairing Britney Spears with Russell Crowe.  Boy was I wrong! She is a complete surprise, especially her singing, and she contributes as much as Phoenix to the film.

I was a bit disappointed in the story, because it stuck pretty much to the musical bio style that Hollywood's been using for half a century.  It could have been about almost any music megastar. We learn a lot about Cash's domestic problems and his addictions, but we gain little insight into the shaping of the talent that allowed him to write and perform as powerfully as he did.  But, again, the performances are so wonderful, they more than compensate for the underwhelming script.

As I was watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking what a wonderful Phantom of the Opera Joaquin Phoenix would have been.

Reese Witherspoon turns out to be more than some bit of blonde fluff. Wow! I loved it. I have been telling everyone how great I think it is and I'll be seeing it again.",1132531200,3,386,4.092105263157895
1609550,4,B00005JO1R,"""Walk the Line"" as James Mangold directs it is not the movie I would have made.  I would have begun at Folsom Prison, and would have carried the movie from there deep into the 1970s, through and beyond Cash's network TV show.  Much of what the rest of the movie covered -- the years between Cash's first record in 1955, and his marriage to June Carter in 1968 -- I would have condensed and inserted as flashbacks during the post-Folsom action.

Then again, that's why they didn't come to me to make the movie.

This film had to introduce Johnny Cash to a 2500-screen audience that hadn't heard all that many records, or read either of his autobiographies.  Thus, the long simmering love story between Carter and Cash takes center stage, with all of the usual beats of a celebrity biopic: the meet cute, the stormy courtship, the offbeat marriage proposal.  All of this material is competently handled and exactly what you would expect.

Joaquin Phoenix has been rightly praised for his performance.  He reportedly spent hundreds of hours learning the guitar and mastering That Voice, and every second of that preparation shows.  No celebrity biopic is going to stand if the actor is not up to par, and I cannot envision someone doing a better job than Phoenix of portraying Johnny Cash from ages 18 through 36.

The real relevation for me, though, was Reese Witherspoon.  The movie takes it first real breath of air when she collides into Phoenix backstage at an early Cash concert in Texas.  Her singing voice is also marvelous.  Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the Carter/Cash duet ""Jackson"" twice in the movie, and nail it both times.

At those moments when Phoneix and Witherspoon are onstage together, and demonstrating their remarkable craft, this movie transcends the typical off-the-rack movie biography, and becomes something truly magical.",1132444800,2,1846,4.912903225806452

A story of a guy and a girl in love for many, many years and the stuggles they encountered.  And even more, the struggles Johnny encountered, including his demons.

1609553,4,B00005JO1R,"James Mangold's ""Walk the Line"" is a decent, slightly plodding show-biz biopic that benefits mightily from the astonishing talents of its two stars. If you've seen the film biographies of Elvis, Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, etc., then you've seen this one; the screenplay is fairly standard and doesn't trim all the fat from the story. During some of the expository scenes, I found that I didn't keep my eyes wide open all the time. But when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were on stage together singing, I was all eyes and ears. Phoenix and Witherspoon have so much electricity together that they virtually give off sparks, and if they don't sound exactly like Johnny Cash and June Carter, they're both good singers and do up the Cash-Carter songbook in fine style. Virtually everybody knows the basic outlines of Cash's story, and it's a story as old as the hills: a good man, beset by tragedy and personal demons, finds redemption through faith in God and the love of a good woman. If Mangold's exposition sometimes gets in the way of the story, Phoenix's performance never does; he brings Cash's pain to galvanizing life, capturing the essence of the man without ever resorting to a mere impressionist's trickery. A few critics have accused Witherspoon of giving us too much Reese and not enough June. I don't know enough about June Carter to tell; I only know that Witherspoon is so charming, funny, impassioned and real here that who cares whether she captures Carter exactly? Among the supporting players, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job as Cash's first wife Vivian, and it's not her fault that she appears in some of the more boring scenes. Phoenix and Witherspoon are sure to be remembered at Oscar time, and they are the urgent, overriding reasons to go see ""Walk the Line.""",1132444800,,1789,4.830618892508143

Witherspoon gives a flawlessly  performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldn't help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself.

But it was interesting and reminded me of some songs I haven't heard in 30 years, and they were better than I expected, even sung by the actors instead of singers.  The relationship between Cash and June Carter develops in a way that's both realistic and romantic, while his relationship with his father is also realistic but kinda sad.  Both of these relationships are resolved as the movie comes to an uplifting conclusion.  Joaquin Phoenix (Signs) is pretty good as Cash, though to me sometimes his performance seemed a bit over the top, but I'm no acting expert, I'm probably wrong.  However, I thought Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven) was sensational as June Carter and  Robert Patrick's (The X-Files) restrained performance as Cash's father was the sort that should win awards.

During parts of the movie you feel like you're watching Cash home movies. Phoenix does an incredible job, not only in portraying Cash but in singing his songs as well. He nails the mannerisms right down to the sideways smile. At times you get chills watching his performance as the resemblence is uncanny. Not so much for Reese Witherspoon, although she also does her own singing and does a great job in her portrayal, I kept seeing Reese and not June. I really liked this movie. Although it doesn't drag it does seem like it's a lot longer than it is. Also as with most bio-pics they stop at a point when things seem to settle down in the career. The movie tells the story of the man in black and his start in the music business. It follows him as he tries to win the heart of June Carter. Along the way other various big names pop up, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Shooter Jennings playing his father Waylon.

 A great movie that is certainly Oscar worthy if for nothing else that for Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal. There's a lot of great music along the way! When June died in 2003 everyone said that Johnny wouldn't last long without her. He didn't. Seeing this movie you understand why.",1132358400,3,1294,4.3875
1609610,4,B00005JO1R,"What is most intriguing about the new Johnny Cash biopic is how Joaquin Phoenix does more of an impressionistic take on the Man in Black rather than the dead-on impersonation that Jaime Foxx did as Ray Charles, or going further back, that Gary Busey did as Buddy Holly. Although Phoenix lacks Cash's craggy features and full-throated delivery, there is enough resemblance vocally and physically for him to get away with it. Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film. When he performs onstage, it is not so much the musicality that gets you but the often scary glare he gives as a tortured soul. Whether destroying a dressing room or feeling ill-at-ease with his stoic parents, it's a powerfully unrelenting performance that evokes Cash's spirit, albeit one that is sometimes too off-putting and humorless over the course of a 136-minute film.

Recent biopics seem to be following similar dramatic patterns. Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to ""Ray"" in treatment - a rural childhood, a demanding parent, a transformative childhood trauma, adultery, drug addiction. However, to Mangold's and co-writer Gill Dennis's credit, he does not go back and forth to Cash's childhood to make us understand his pain. Instead, he deals with it succinctly upfront and uses the periodic reappearance of his parents as the emotional link. The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core. Cash's incessant, decade-long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.

Reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real-life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern-fried sensibility. What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in ""Vanity Fair"" or her overachieving half-spirit in ""Just Like Heaven"",  are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks. She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially ""Jackson"", are among the movie's best moments. Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing. As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no-nonsense nurturing that attracts our attention more than Phoenix's doleful responses.

It's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real-life performers or the actors portraying them. Some voices are so recognizable as to defy impersonation (e.g., using Ray Charles' original tracks in ""Ray""). Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter.  Credit needs to go to T. Bone Burnett for training them so well for six months. There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.

The movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm-singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small-minded shrew. Like all-fact-based movies, the movie can also feel episodic, and it does sag somewhat in the middle as the film belabors Cash's amphetamine addiction. Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood filmmaking with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.",1132358400,2,4070,5.253846153846154

136 minutes

released November 18, 2005

Walk The Line is an excellent film and is elevated above being a typical biopic by the stellar cast and the performances by the two lead actors. I wouldn't be surprised if Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix receive Oscar nominations,not to mention a Best Picture nod for the film itself. Director James Mangold received acclaim for Cop Land (1997) and Girl, Interrupted (1999, in which Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for best supporting actress.)

Phoenix's portrayal is understated and subtle as opposed to being over the top and flashy. It seemed realistic and heartfelt as he struggled through bittersweet moments. You see the tough upbringing he had with a drunken, cold and seemingly loveless father (Robert Patrick (1958), X-File's John Doggett and Terminator Two's T-1000). The friendship with his older brother ended due to tragedy and his father placed some of the blame on Johnny, who was fishing at the time. He felt guilty about this his whole life. Over sixty years later, Cash talked about how he looked forward to meeting his brother again in Heaven. His first marriage turned cold as his wife took little interest in his life on the road. At the same time, you he pinned for the lovely and divorced June Carter (1929), who constantly rebuffed him as he took to a life of popping pills, further digging himself into a pit of despair. Or a ring of fire. He used to listen to radio broadcasts of the Carter Family, which included a young June, in the 1940s.

It's interesting to note that all the Johnny Cash and June Carter vocals were sung by Phoenix and Witherspoon. And they did play my favorite Cash tune, the crackling ""Jackson"", which won them a Grammy in 1967, in the Best Country & Western Performance, Duet, Trio Or Group (vocal or instrumental) category.

One of my favorite scenes in the film was the audition for Sam Phillips (1923), owner of Sun Records, the seminal early roots and rock'n'roll label that helped launch Elvis, and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others. He gave honest feedback regarding the gospel song that Cash's band performed to try and get a deal. He asked Cash that if he was in a car wreck and had time to sing just one more song before he died, what would he sing? Cash to performed one of his non-gospel, from the heart songs, written while he was in the military, and this was the very first Johnny Cash recording, ""Hey Porter.""

Until now, I have always thought of Reese Witherspoon as a credible but limited actress, a flyweight. This is arguably her best role and is a terrific performance. She's razor sharp and when she's on stage with Phoenix, she's totally convincing as a performer.

If you ever wondered how Johnny Cash ended up recording Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison (1968), you get the explanation and see the resistance. For years, he received a ton of fan mail from inmates and incareated men, people who could relate to the songs about lawbreaking and the outlaw life.

I couldn't help but feel sorry for Cash, due to certain scenes, especially ones involving his father. During one Thanksgiving at Cash's beautiful new house and waterfront acreage, his dad couldn't say a kind word but instead levelled criticism at his famous son, who, in 1969, was arguably the hottest act in the world, outselling even the Beatles. Meanwhile, it was apparent that Johnny Cash so desperately wanted his father's unconditional love, something that was long overdue.

You do get to see Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings and the Killer, Jerry Lee Lewis, but they in no way overshadow Cash in this story. You also get to see how Cash and June Carter had a chance to develop and solidify their friendship and love. They toured together with a few other artists, and later, together.

True, this film is not unlike last year's Ray: poor boy grows up to eventually become hot young star, takes pills, does some womanizing, ends up in the slammer, eventually comes clean and lives out the rest of his life trouble-free.

If you see this film, there's bound to be emotions that you can really relate to. Johnny Cash was a performer people truly identified with. He's hard his share of hard knocks, disappointments. His attempts to come to terms with his outlaw lifestyle in light of his strong spiritual beliefs, was what he sang about.",1132272000,12,4317,4.748998664886515
1609613,5,B00005JO1R,"As a die-hard Johnny Cash fan, I had looked forward to this movie for at least a year. After watching the trailers, I was slightly afraid it would be overacted and hard to watch(all the commercial scenes seemed a bit overdramatized, after all), but still had to see this movie.  After watching it, however, I was amazed. It is close to a perfect movie.

Joaquin and Reese really put a lot into their performances. I was skeptical about them doing their own singing when I heard about it, but they did a super job. While they're clearly no Johnny and June, the two's singing fits in perfectly with the movie. Anyway, I was very satisfied with this. It didn't change history to attract viewers, and it didn't breeze over the hard parts of his life. It skipped some things, but that would be necessary for the time limit. A very well-made movie, with plenty of small details thrown in throughout. I recommend it to any Johnny Cash fan, or to anybody, for that matter.",1132272000,12,964,4.5344827586206895
1609614,4,B00005JO1R,"Movie biopics are generally problematic: how do you get all or a major portion of a person's life on the screen in more or less than 2 hours? How do you do justice to anyone's life in 120 minutes?
There have been good examples of course, but most of them have been good because the writer or director has wisely chosen to telescope/hone in on a relatively short portion of a subject's life: Billie Holiday's in ""Lady Sings the Blues"" or Truman Capote's in ""Capote."" Both films, I realize with wildly different results, but both equally effective because the focus of each has been telescoped and better stated...microscoped onto a short portion of each life: both Truman Capote and Billie Holiday have been revealed and analyzed and effectively appreciated through the learned and discretionary eye of someone who effectively separates the legend from the reality.
Director James Mangold (the quirky ""Heavy"" and the effective ""The Yards"") would not seem a logical choice to direct a probing film about Johnny Cash (an audaciously effective Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter ( a wonderful Reese Witherspoon) but he does manage most of the time to steer away from the maudlin and melodramatic and in the process comes up with a good, straight-forward biopic of the two.
The obvious comparison to ""Walk The Line"" would be the recent ""Ray"" but whereas Jamie Foxx's recreation of Ray Charles borders on caricature and mimicry, Phoenix's Cash always seems and feels organic: he doesn't so much as inhabit Cash's spirit and persona as interpret it. Phoenix not only uses his own voice to sing the songs...he uses his own psychic voice to creep inside of Cash to reveal the Cash inside of Phoenix and the Phoenix inside of Cash and this translates into a thrilling, revealing portrait of the two.
Witherspoon also does her own singing and because we know a lot less of Carter's life, manufactures and makes real a character that is both simple and straightforward as well as one who, though she loves and admires her talented and famous family, longs for her own place in the world in general and in the entertainment world specifically: she is less wounded than Cash but equally on the lookout for personal and professional validation.
""Walk The Line"" is not the best movie ever made but it certainly is not the worst. The best biopics require strong, incandescent performances at their core and ""WTL""has that in spades with Phoenix and Witherspoon's revolutionary recreations/interpretations of Cash and Carter.
Enter the world of ""Walk The Line"" with an open mind and heart and you will be rewarded with both a noble and novel interpretation of two lives and two people who dared to be talented and blessed in a world that often attempted to stamp out and diffuse those that were different in favor of mediocrity.",1132272000,94,2807,4.886792452830188
1609615,5,B00005JO1R,"President Jimmy Carter said after seeing ""Cold Miner's Daughter"" that the movie was much better than he expected. The same could be said about this film and then some. These kinds of movies often fall flatter than a young bride's first baked biscuits. This one doesn't. Joaquin Phoenix (""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Gladiator"") is just about perfect as Johnny Cash. He resembles him both in appearance and in his voice-- he does all the Cash songs himself-- and Reese Witherspoon (""Legally Blonde"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest"") convinced me that she was June Carter. (She sings June's songs herself as well.) Witherspoon captures the essence of the character with both her humor and decency. (It is common knowledge that Cash gave June and her mother Maybelle Carter the major credit for his getting off drugs and turning his life around.)

Some of the minor characters are miscast. Elvis Presley for one. With more Elvis impersonators now alive than ever before in history, it is inconceivable that a better Elvis couldn't have been found. On the other hand, some of the actors with cameo parts are quite wonderful: Mother Maybelle, Johnny's mother in middle age with her cat-eye glasses and Pentecostal hairdo and the bank teller who refuses to cash Cash's check, for instance.

Some of the best scenes are those in which Phoenix sings. When he auditions for Sam Phillips at Sun Records, after trying a tired version of the then popular religious song ""I Was There When It Happened,"" he breaks into a gritty, soulful version of ""Folsom Prison Blues"" worthy of the Man in Black, himself. The concert at Folsom Prison with June in the wings is electric as well; then there is the concert in Canada where Cash proposes to Carter before an enthusiastic audience that will make your eyes water.

Director James Mangold (""Kate & Leopold"" and ""Girl, Interrupted"") does an excellent job of keeping Carter and Cash's relationship from becoming too sentimental and also prevents the film from turning into a religious tract since Carter and Cash became devout Christians. (Only once does June say that God has given Johnny a second chance to make something of his life.) They are portrayed here as what they apparently were in real life, two less than perfect but decent, talented people who had one of the great contemporary love affairs that spanned almost forty years. Trite as it may sound, ""Walk the Line"" is ultimately about the enduring power of love. This is a film you will want to see again. The soundtrack is quite fine and stands on its own. Phoenix's talent as a singer is the biggest surprise of the movie. He and Witherspoon are likely Oscar contenders for their performances.

Apparently Johnny Cash approved of having Mr. Phoenix play him in this movie. It is sad that neither he nor his wife lived to see this production. They would both have loved it.",1132272000,9,2862,4.846625766871166
1609616,5,B00005JO1R,"In WALK THE LINE, Joaquin Phoenix shows that he's come a long way since his role as the crazy Caesar in GLADIATOR.

Those going into WALK THE LINE thinking it's a comprehensive film bio of Johnny Cash may perhaps come out slightly disappointed. While there's a relative brief sequence of his early years growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm, an even briefer sequence of his time in the Air Force in the early 50s, the film really begins in 1955 when, failing as a door-to-door salesman and wannabe gospel singer, he cuts a rock 'n' roll record for Sun Studios in Memphis and his career as a CW crooner takes off. The film ends with his marriage to June Carter in 1968. In between, against the backdrop of early hits, it focuses on his failed marriage to first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), his self-destructive abuse of amphetamines, and rocky relationship with singer/actress Carter (Reese Witherspoon), a twice-divorced single mother of two.

The real treat of WALK THE LINE is watching Phoenix and Witherspoon amaze with Oscar-caliber dramatic performances. Who would have suspected that the latter was capable of anything other than light comedy?

In case you haven't seen the film and you're wondering, Phoenix and Witherspoon themselves sing the Cash/Carter material; they're surprisingly effective. Mind you, I've never been such a Cash fan that I've possessed any of his albums, and I've only previously downloaded one of his songs (""City of New Orleans""). Indeed, when Phoenix and Witherspoon recreate the Cash/Carter duet of ""Jackson"", my first thought was: Didn't Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood do that?

Coming out of the screening, my wife remarked that Phoenix sounded very much like Johnny himself. My response was a non-committal but prudent ""Mmmm"". Back home at the computer, I downloaded a couple more Cash songs, including his ""Jackson"" duet with Carter. To my ears, the real Cash had a singing voice that was slightly hoarser, and with a more pronounced slow drawl than Joaquin's version. While that doesn't detract from the actor's performance, it may cause purists to grumble.

The film's opening scene is of two guards on a tower at Folsom Prison listening to the bass ""thump, thump, thump"" washing over the prison yard from the hall in which Cash is about to perform his famous concert before the inmates. My wife and I were sitting in the front row of the studio screening theater and the sound reverberated through our bones. I knew then that WALK THE LINE was going to be an exceptional film.",1132272000,324,2523,4.9270588235294115

I've always been a huge fan of Johnny Cash, his music was revolutionary and I feel he was a separate music genre unto himself. And
he died with his boots on, in poor health he wrote and sang many, many songs after June's death, especially; ' I hurt myself today '...
