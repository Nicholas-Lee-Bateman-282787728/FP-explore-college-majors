8235762,4,B000ZKQLTY,"So what is a Razor Eater?  In this case, a Razor Eater is one of the gang of 5 who have been terrorizing Melbourne, Australia recently with a string of murders and terrorist acts.  To their credit, the Razor Eaters have specified they're targeting drug dealers, so they have the support of the people and fans all over town who are wearing Razor Eater shirts.  But for the police, and Detective Berdan in particular, they're still breaking the law and have to be taken in.

This is the simple premise of Shannon Young's 2003 movie RAZOR EATERS, and it's a simple enough one, probably could have let it go at that and shot a quick, violent movie and been on his way.  But apparently that's not how Shannon Young does things.  For starters, the movie is filmed in a faux found footage style as one of the Razor Eaters--I'm going to assume it was Rob, but I honestly had a hard time keeping them all straight; however Rob was played by the writer/director, so I think this is a safe assumption--is filming their exploits.  So we not only see everything from the Razor Eaters' POV, but we also are meant to feel a part of the group.  However, at the same time we're seeing the events unfold on camera via the Razor Eaters, we're also following along with Det. Berdan as he tries to track them down and end their reign.

I thought this was a pretty interesting way to handle the found footage method, which is usually an all-in arrangement, meaning if it's not ""on camera"", we don't get to see it.  Unfortunately, this usually calls for a lot of silly situations in which the camera is brought along in the midst of the fight, and it's supposed to seem totally natural that it's there.  The movie CHRONICLE was pretty bad at that, but they also balanced it out by actually using multiple cameras from multiple ""sources"" during their biggest moments, so it didn't feel so awkward.

The Det. Berdan scenes, however, aren't shot as found footage, we just step outside of the camera and watch Berdan's scene as we would any other in any other movie.  It's a nice break from the frenetic energy of the Razor Eater scenes.

Another nice change is that all of the Razor Eaters (with the exception of the cameraman and Zach, the leader) get a short spotlight interview.  This helps the audience understand the characters and what would lead them to this lifestyle and why they seem to follow Zach so blindly.  The truth is, however, each of them have their reasons, and they're not following blindly at all, but with open eyes and full intent.

The movie lasted 99 minutes, which is a bit longer than average, but I think that extra run time gave the story room to breathe and grow, and a well-developed story is always preferable over a lazy, mediocre one.

The acting is almost a gimme here.  I mean other than half a dozen young Australian men jumping around, yelling, waving guns and basically being obnoxious and loud, there's not much ACTING going on here.  Except during the one-on-one interviews, and in those scenes, the actors really come to the fore and show what they've got.  They were some pretty well-done scenes and they definitely had an impact on the story and the quality of the movie as well.

Young also didn't skimp on the story when it came to the climax.  The bulk of the movie seems to be a manifesto, calling out the evils of society, whether it be the unnecessarily rich, drug dealers, parking cops, bouncers, or those annoying punks who ride through the streets blasting their sub-woofer noise pollution while people are trying to sleep.  For the bulk of the movie, the story seems to be something of a call to arms.  But in the last 10 minutes, a few secrets are revealed, and we see there's an entire new aspect of the story, one we should have caught earlier, but Young was too busy misleading us.  The denouement was well-conceived, I thought, and gave a proper ending to the preceding.

RAZOR EATERS isn't going to be a movie that's for everyone.  I'll probably never bother watching it again.  But for what it is, it's a decent flick with some decent production value and the story kept me engaged.  Despite what I said about giving the story room to breathe, I did start to feel it was running a bit long, but not too long.

Young is catering to multiple crowds here.  There's the violence-loving anarchistic crowd, and then there's the crowd that just wants to see an interesting movie.  With RAZOR EATERS, Shannon Young has satisfied both camps, and that can't be an easy feat to pull off.  Kudos.",1380326400,,4521,4.561338289962825
8235763,3,B000ZKQLTY,"Good show!  This low budget unknown is quite good.  Vigilantes set out to rid Melbourne of dealers and frustrate police from the get-go.  Brutal murder after murder, with the intent of gaining a hoard of followers, the Ravor Eaters create chaos and mayhem to shake up the law and the lawless.  I only gave it a three because of the lack of sound quality.  It was already difficult trying to sustain the Aussies diction, but when it's muffled, it's almost a silent picture.  It's definitely worth a look.  I enjoyed it.  And I loved the ending.",1273708800,2,543,4.583333333333333
8235764,4,B000ZKQLTY,"I had heard some good things about Razor Eaters, and I feel those good things are very justified. The film is very gritty, and in a documentary style, which cleverly hides the low budget. But it works, it definitely works. And even though this is a low budget movie, it's well acted, well shot (even though most of it is shot on handheld), and well written. This gang committed loathsome acts, but gained a cult following, why? Because you had to kind of admire what they were doing. Killing a guy who ran a dog fighting ring (my favorite part), drug dealers, an arms dealer and more. But the movie isn't all about random violence, there's some depth behind everything, and I'll leave it at that, I don't want to ruin things for you. This movie is compared to Natural Born Killers, and while it doesn't quite reach that caliber, it is still a very entertaining ride.",1241827200,3,866,4.522292993630574
