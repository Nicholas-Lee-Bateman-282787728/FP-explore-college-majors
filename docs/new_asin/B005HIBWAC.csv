8473047,5,B005HIBWAC,"Love, Cheat & Steal is a must see for fans of great Bank Heist movies. Lithgow is excellent as usual, and Eric Roberts certainly delivers as the villian (second only to his performance in CBS's Person of Interest). The plot is interesting and keeps you guessing, although you might think you know the score from the start. But, only Lithgow knows the score!

It's one of those movies that transcends its time (the early 90's) and is still relevant in 2013. Also, the heist scene is quite well executed, not unlike the ones in ""Loophole"" and ""Mission Impossible"". This heist movie is one for the books, so if you have to buy the VHS version so be it. It's worth it if you can appreciate amazing movies. If not, then you must shut down your computer immediately. Good bye.
