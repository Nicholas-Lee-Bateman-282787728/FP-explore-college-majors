1197448,3,B000009HEV,"A not too bad action film from the 70's with George Lazenby as a Aussie mob boss taken on by a karate/kung fu cop (Jimmy Wang YU) from Hong Kong.  Lazenby's death is a classic moment to rank with Cagney's top of the world in White Heat.  Too bad this isn't yet on region 1 DVD.  Film's theme song (""Sky High"") was a modest hit on the top 40 charts.",1194912000,,348,3.942857142857143

1197450,4,B000009HEV,"Originally entitled 'The Dragon Flies,' this movie showed the world that Australia could cut it with the best of them in terms of action films.  As far as I can see, it is only panned nowadays because of its age and style.  Well, it was a while ago and it is curious co-production between Australia and Hong Kong - so Aussie accents and questionable dubbing are bound to attract some derision.  Even so, it covered all the bases with its combination of James Bond-ish action, brilliantly arranged car chase and over-the-top kung-fu.

Set mainly in Sydney, but with early scenes shot in Hong Kong, it centres on the story of a Hong Kong police inspector who travels to Australia to assist local police in their search for a huge Southern Hemisphere drug cartel.  One-time James Bond star and real-life martial arts expert George Lazenby ironically plays our charismatic narcotics kingpin, Wilton.  Oriental star Jimmy Wang Yu plays our Hong Kong police inspector.  The all-star cast includes Rebecca Gilling, Roger Ward, Frank Thring and Ros Spiers.  Of course, they are only faces that will be familiar to Australasians or learned fans of Australian cinema.
As otherwise noted, Sammo Hung pops up at the beginning, long before he starred in the 1999 U.S. TV series Martial Law.  He is memorably chased up Ayers Rock by Roger Ward.
Great kudos go to Noel Quinlan for the funky seventies soundtrack that perfectly compliments the action throughout.
As a fan of car chase, I feel special mention is to be made of the dramatic car chase finale.  It showed that Australians could choreograph a car chase that was second to no other country.
But look at what they had to work with.  The star was undoubtedly the venerable Valiant Charger.  It was quite allegorical, the way the two-door Aussie icon was pitted against its foreign-inspired rivals.  After blowing off a motorbike, the Charger goes after, and wipes out, a Vauxhall-inspired LC Holden Torana.  Finally, the all-Australian Muscle car takes on the American-sourced Aussie Ford Falcon to devastating effect.  The soundtrack even captures the ubiquitous throb of the Chrysler Hemi engine.  This was the best car chase ever filmed in Australia without a doubt.  It was a great end to a great 70's film.",1070496000,3,2254,4.920634920634921
1197451,4,B000009HEV,"This movie was recently released in (2.35:1 widescreen) DVD by Screensound Australia, the business name of the National Screen & Sound Archives of Australia.  I personally have a copy of this one and it's great.  Special features include:
* Director's commentary by Brian Trenchard Smith, together with actor Hugh Keays Byrne and stunt director Grant Page (who doubled for Jimmy Wang Yu in several scenes and also starred as the guy who he fights in the Chinese restuarant)
* Picture gallery, including behind-the-scenes footage (including of the car chase)
* Original Australian news items about the stars and opening night (these are very kitch)
* Original Australian theatrical trailer
* Detailed colour bonus booklet
This has rightly been recognised as a classic of Australian cinema, mainly because it was the first collaboration with an Asian film company (Golden Harvest).  It was an attempt by Golden Harvest to move forward in the direction of 'Enter the Dragon' after Bruce Lee's death, and it seems that they still had a contract with George Lazenby (who was originally to appear in 'Game of Death' -- see the extras to the Hong Kong Legends Platinum Edition of Game of Death, released last year in the UK).
The DVD is in PAL format.  This means that US buyers will only be able to play it on their laptops etc if they do not have a converter or a dual-format television.  It is encoded as Region 4, which shouldn't be as much of a problem, requiring only a multi-region hack or 'dezoning'.
Best of luck finding this one on the web ... the australian government sites are probably the best place to start.",1037491200,9,1616,4.819494584837545
1197452,2,B000009HEV,"Also known as THE DRAGON FLIES,this standard chop-socky actioner is a Hong Kong/ Australia co-production, and features former 007 George Lazenby (the one movie wonder) as the main bad guy.
The plot, or what there is of it, centers around an innocent man who is wanted by Australian police for murder, armed robbery and drug trafficking, and sets out to nail the drug kingpin who framed him for it. Star Jimmy Wang Yu is no Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. The movie has no shortage of stunts but they are unimaginatively filmed (maybe it was because of a limited budget or incompetant directing/ editing). This is particularly disappointing as they are performed by Grant Page, the man who would later mastermind the stunts for the MAD MAX trilogy, the film co-stars Hugh Keays-Byrne and Roger Ward who were in MAD MAX 1. THE MAN FROM HONG KONG also contains one of the most boring car chases ever filmed.
Another problem with this movie is while viewing it, it's obvious that the Asian actors voices have been dubbed, while the Aussies aren't, although the result is unintentionally amusing, and the acting is pretty bad.
And finally, I'll finish of with a  snippet of awful dialogue from the movie especially amusing because of how the Australian government have been treating immigrants lately:
Aussie cop: There's no need to be rude, man. There's no torture, no thunbscrews. This is Australia, we're not allowed to get into that sort of thing, mate"".
Wang Yu: He's a Chinese. I'm a Chinese. Don't worry.
Well, if a belated sequel to this movie pops up in the future, we should worry. And keep your eyes peeled for a cameo by Samo Hung.",1034208000,,1632,4.726315789473684
1197453,3,B000009HEV,"As far as these films go, this one has pretty standard action.  But The Man From Hong Kong is an oddity among the kung fu films of the 1970s.  It  is directed by an Australian director, and it takes place mostly in  Australia with a predominately Australian cast.  The exception is star  Jimmy Wang Yu, who says his lines in English but is obviously dubbed.
This particular version of the film has both Chinese and English  subtitles.  Unfortunately, the English subtuitles are an the bottom of the  screen, below the Chinese subtitles (the dubbing is also Chinese - perhaps  one is Mandarin and one Cantonese).  But since this is not widescreen, the  English subtitles often go off the screen making it difficult to read!
I  bought this video because of George Lazenby, who moves very well for a man  his size.  An almost unreocgnizable Sammo Hung also makes an appearance as  a bad guy.  It is odd to note that many actors who became famous playing a  specific hero, end up playing the villain in just about every other film.
Because of the problem with the subtitles, I would recommend this film  only for purists and completists - until an English version becomes  available.  20th Century Fox released this film domestically in theaters,  but who knows if they still have the rights, or if they would consider a  video release.",968025600,3,1332,4.695652173913044

7905461,5,B000009HEV,"""The Man From Hong Kong"" was last seen by me when I lived in Florida in 1975 and when cable TV was slowly starting to become the rage. This classic (extremely rare) stars Jimmy Wang-Yu as Detective Fang, who travels to Australia to crack a major case involving a courier (a young Sammo Hung, born Kim Po Hung, ""Martial Law"", franchised from ""Walker, Texas Ranger"", which starred Chuck Norris, Sheree J. Wilson, Clarence Gilyard and the late Noble Willingham, ""Good Morning Vietnam"") bringing in contraband from a Sydney arms kingpin named Wilton (George Lazenby, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", MGM / United Artists). Fang wants this guy badly but two of Australia's finest (one of them is played by Hugh Keyes-Byrne, Toecutter from the original ""Mad Max""), have to tell Fang the rules of law enforcement. Fang and Wilton meet and fight at one of Wilton's swank parties (for Fang, this doesn't go well). He is tended to by a woman he falls in love with. However, Wilton has his goons on Fang's heels. She is killed and the rulebook is out the window! This will be Wilton's last explosive mistake! (Golden Harvest / Bonzai Media)",1420675200,,1131,4.775510204081633

7905463,2,B000009HEV,I ordered this DVD after waiting for it for years. For the most part it was good however during the car chase scene the data transfer was terrible and the DVD wouldn't play properly. After notifying the third party seller DaVeeDee they informed me - because I opened it I would be served with a 20% restocking fee as well as paying for return postage!!! I immediately got onto Amazon who arranged a refund.,1391817600,,406,4.5
7905464,5,B000009HEV,"A little back story on this film the movie was originally written for the late great Bruce Lee his untimely death left Raymond Chow (chief of Golden Harvest studio) in a difficult position. It just so happens at the same time Jimmy Wong Yu's contract expired at Shaw Bros, so Chow immediately sign Jimmy for the film. That is why the fight scenes are very realistic similar to Lee's films, also Sammo Huang is a close friend of Bruce Lee's, remember Sammo's appearance in Enter the Dragon. All said a great action film one could only wished Bruce Lee would have live longer to have star in this film. For those fans who can read Chinese, the Chinese title is a loving tribute to the great ""Little Dragon"".",1389657600,,705,4.515625
7905465,5,B000009HEV,"Ah, Australia in the 70s - where films were cheap but life was cheaper. The Man From Hong Kong (released in the US as The Dragon Flies), George Lazenby's second-finest hour, is a thing of joy - an exploitation movie that does what it says on the label even if Jimmy Wang Yu doesn't exactly burn up the screen as `the tough Hong Kong cop who learned every trick in the book - then threw the book away.' Unlike Lazenby. Where else can you see a film where they set a former James Bond on fire - for real - and he just goes on fighting? Roger, Shir Sean and Pierce would never have done that in a million years. Not only is he `the ruthless czar of international evil' but he's racist with it - ""I've never met a Chinese yet that didn't have a yellow streak!"" - and even has Frank Thring on the payroll, sneering disdain as only he could at a hero who can only speak English in a badly dubbed American accent (""We like to bounce our customers, not to break them""). Thring at least lasts longer than Sammo Hung, who choreographed the fight scenes and has a supporting role billed as Hung Kam Po before taking an early shower before he can show up the star too much (""A master of kung fu, he used his art for an evil purpose, but he fought well. I will like to meet the man who employed him."").

Wang Yu is never more than adequate - Lazenby still looks like he could beat him in a fair fight, even when on fire - but the film is so much fun and such an intoxicating mixture of car chases, outrageous action movie stunts, gratuitous hang gliding and. in at least one sequence, literally pant-splittingly good fight scenes that it doesn't matter. This is the kind of movie where stuntmen get kicked off racing motorcycles or thrown through very solid objects and stage terrific car chases on back roads without bothering to tell the local police, who probably wouldn't understand why they needed to destroy quite so much property in the process. Indeed, director Brian Trenchard-Smith's original pitch was a bulldozing cop who causes more collateral damage than the villain he takes down (""This country's got a small population, and he's getting through them very fast!""). That tends to get lost until the big car chase near the end of the film, but there's plenty of choice locking of cultural horns between him and Hugh Keays-Byrne's hip local detective en route (""I don't want to be rude, man, but no torture, no thumbscrews. This is Australia. We're not allowed to get into that sort of thing, mate.""). There's even room for the odd love scene with the two leading ladies, and boy is Wang Yu a charmer:

""Do you think you've recovered enough for me to make love to you?""
""I think I could stand the pain.""
""That was nice.""
""What did you expect - acupuncture?""

And that's not mentioning the infectiously catchy title song, Sky High. Ah, they don't make 'em like they used to...

The deleted original Australian PAL DVD version from ScreenSound was a single disc in 1.85:1, but Madman's  Australian PAL DVD 2-disc version is in the proper 2.35:1 ratio and includes a couple of additional Trenchard-Smith efforts - 72-minute documentary Kung Fu Killers and short film Hospitals Don't Burn Down as well as plenty of mute behind the scenes footage and the film's trailer. It still has Trenchard-Smith's audio commentary, which, while not as explicit as some of the comments made on the documentary Not Quite Hollywood, details just what an arrogant xenophobic sexist nightmare Jimmy Wang Yu was to deal with during the shoot (when the director cameoed as a thug in a fight in a lift, Wang Yu didn't pull any punches, and that was one of his better days). Not all the extras have been carried over from the original release, but the new ones more than compensate. Great fun.",1351555200,,3766,4.540500736377025
7905466,2,B000009HEV,"Wall to wall cliches. An Australian/Hong Kong production with a former James Bond as a villain, martial arts choreographed by Hung Kam Po (Sammo Hung), and vehicular mayhem by Grant Page (who did the same for Mad Max a few years later). This almost plays like a parody of a 70s action drama. A very silly movie.",1322179200,,311,4.473684210526316
7905467,3,B000009HEV,"Australia's first martial arts film (a co-production with Raymond Chow's Golden Harvest) delivers a steady stream of colorful action. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith keeps the mayhem moving while utilizing picturesque locales ranging from Ayers Rock to Stanwell Park. Kung fu star Jimmy Wang Yu lacks charisma but performs some impressive stunts - leading to an explosive showdown with the memorably villainous George Lazenby.

7905468,4,B000009HEV,"The main Chinese dude is ""OK"" but he did not make the movie for me. I was glad to see the Toecutter and FEE-FEE.  70's early 80's feel, it's really quite trippy that a movie like this even exists, a Chinaman raising cain and doing hot honeys in Australia.",1253232000,3,255,4.204081632653061
7905469,2,B000009HEV,"Jimmy Wang Yu had been a star of Hong Kong martial arts films and swordplay adventures for ten years (ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN, CHINESE BOXER), first for Shaw Bros. and then for Golden Harvest, when he was assigned by the latter to make THE MAN FROM HONG KONG (1975) in Australia, in English, with an Australian crew, with fight scenes choreographed by Hong Kong actor Sammo Hung. The idea was to try to position Wang Yu as an international star, the ""new Bruce Lee,"" and replicate the success of the Hollywood/Golden Harvest co-production from two years earlier, ENTER THE DRAGON, starring Bruce Lee, who had died in July 1973, a month before the film's release.

In THE MAN FROM HONG KONG (released in the U.S. as THE DRAGON FLIES), Wang Yu had to forego his usual intensity and play a suave, womanizing Hong Kong detective (""Special Branch"") who comes to Sydney, Australia to extradite a drug peddler (Sammo Hung), but winds up embroiled in a running battle with Sydney crime boss Wilton, played by George Lazenby, a one-time James Bond (ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE). Like so many 1970s action movies, the flimsy plot is routinely put on hold to indulge in gratuitous chase scenes filled with lame gags. There are a couple of '70s-obligatory love scenes pairing Wang Yu with two forgettable Australian actresses. One of these includes a long, insipid romantic montage involving horseback riding on a ranch in the Aussie countryside, underscored by the song, ""A Man is a Man is a Man.""

There are plenty of fight scenes, though, and I have to admit that for a mid-1970s made-in-Australia action film, the fights are certainly better-than-average. However, once you've seen what Hong Kong filmmakers were doing so successfully at the time, it's hard to be very impressed. Choreographer Sammo Hung, who went on to become a notable kung fu film director himself, was somewhat hampered by the Australians' demand for more ""realistic"" fight scenes, meaning he had to subdue his normally active kung fu imagination and concentrate on ""street fighting,"" much of which is quite brutal and bloody. There is one fairly traditional Hong Kong-style kung fu sequence involving traditional weapons at a martial arts school, where Wang Yu takes on a room full of Chinese ""students"" working for the villain. Sammo appears in a pre-credits fight scene staged on the picturesque Outback tourist site, Ayers Rock. Lazenby has a few fight scenes also, and he's not bad. There's also a clever finale involving a penthouse, a vault filled with explosives and a 90-second fuse.

Wang Yu is dubbed in English throughout. His character speaks Mandarin in one scene with Sammo, forcing the viewer to grab the remote, reverse the disc a few seconds and turn on the subtitles.

Interestingly, the film's theme song, ""Sky High,"" is more famous than the film itself. Performed by a group called Jigsaw, it became a top-40 hit at the time and is still played on oldies stations. (""You've blown it all sky high, by telling me a lie, without a reason why..."")

This Region 3 DVD from Fortune Star offers a high quality print and transfer. Extras include the original trailer and two deleted dialogue scenes, one of which fills in a minor, but gnawing plot hole.",1213056000,2,3229,4.906593406593407
