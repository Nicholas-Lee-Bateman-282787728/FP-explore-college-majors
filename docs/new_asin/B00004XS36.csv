1369490,5,B00004XS36,"If you have a collection of original cast albums and have ever wondered what goes on the day the show is recorded this fascinating documentary tells it all.
D A Pennebaker spent 18 hours with the cast, musicians and recording crew commiting the recording of the show to film.
On May 3, 1970 they all convened on Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in New York. Elaine Stritch's recording ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" is a fascinating and frightening event.  It truly captures what a great talent Stritch is.
There is commentary on the DVD that is quite interesting.  Additional footage is included along with the problems Dean Jones, the shows star, was having in his life.  Elaine Stritch has also supplied her recollections on that day 30 years ago.
I highly recommend this.",1019260800,6,771,4.825757575757576
1369491,5,B00004XS36,"Adding to what others have already said, this record of producing a record of a Broadway show is remarkable. It blew me away, as they say. There's no people like show people - and here they are. Fabulous, nervy, talented beyond belief. Stritch doing and re-doing ""Ladies Who Lunch"" is very good, but the moment for me was Dean Jones singing ""Being Alive"". He sings with such heart felt emotion. It moved me to tears. This show is all about New Yorkers, and this song brought back to me the memory of so many New York friends, from that time in the 1970's who are no longer with us. This was their world, a city of strangers, and Sondheim captured it so magnificently. A masterpiece if ever there was one.",1010102400,7,704,4.423076923076923
1369492,5,B00004XS36,"For anyone who is a fan of musical theater or Sondheim in particular, this is a stunningly brilliant slice of that world, and a must-buy. Seeing a young Sondheim interact with and coach the singers during the recording session is worth the price by itself. But you'll also enjoy the wonderful Elaine Stritch peform and struggle with 'Ladies who Lunch', along with Dean Jones, Donna McKechnie in her prime, and the rest of the brilliant cast. I saw 'Company' four times, and this brought those experiences all back.",999907200,8,514,4.8522727272727275
1369493,5,B00004XS36,"If you care about musical theatre, then you will want to see this 1-hour condesation of the 18 1/2 hour recording session that yielded the original cast album of COMPANY.
This documentary will give you an idea of how much sweat goes into making these albums... usually done in one long day in a cramped recording studio.  Once you see this documentary, you'll listen to the album in a totally different way.  Watch Sondheim coach the singers:  correct their pronunciations, or even correct notes they have changed over the weeks of performances.  Best of all watch Elaine Stritch struggle to record ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" until exhaustion gets the better of her and she starts screaming back at her own playback.  And yet ... and yet the final result is worth it!  No other cast album documentary captures as much as this one.
A must for those who know that cast albums are NOT ""soundtracks!""",971654400,38,892,4.72258064516129
1369494,2,B00004XS36,"I was expecting a video of the production,instead I got a documentary of the making of the audio recording. Interesting, but not what I was hoping for...and very short for a DVD. Obviously a made for TV documentary,not a record of the show.",1192579200,2,240,4.604651162790698
1369495,5,B00004XS36,"I never saw Company on stage, but was introduced to snippets of it on a DVD about Broadway and realized I would probably like the whole album.  So, I ordered it, and I did.

Then I rented the DVD that shows how the cast album was made. .and that was even better!  So, I hope that someday Company will tour. . I think it may be doing a Revival on Broadway, but  I'd have to check that out. . but whatever the case, it's an interesting and well done cast recording and if you are a Sonheim fan, a must for your collection.",1171584000,3,520,4.019417475728155
1369496,3,B00004XS36,"What I expected from this album did not happen and for that I am sorry.  You see, I am so old that back in the old, old sixties, I saw this show on the Broadway stage along with Dean Stockwell and broke out in goosebumps when Elaine Stritch sung her classic ""Here's to the Ladies Who Lunch!""  What's on this DVD is NOT the show, but merely sketches of the rehearsals, much like the beginning of ""Follies in Concert.""  In ""Follies"" they went on to do the whole programme and went away satisfied.  In ""Company"" that did not happen and when the rehearsal was over they all went home and that was the end of it!  I was so shocked that they (the producers of the DVD) would do that, that I didn't believe it and went back to the scene selections looking for a show--there was none.  It's not a question of space on the DVD as I stated, they followed that format in ""Follies.""  So, in sum, I adore Stephen Sondheim and I liked the real show ""Company""--but the DVD leaves me there wishing for the whole show.  This DVD album is a ripoff!

1369497,5,B00004XS36,"This rare treat from documentary filmmaker Pennebaker is a must-have for any Sondheim lover like me. Elaine Stritch's ""hung-over"" initial rendition of the classic song The Ladies Who Lunch is unbelievable. The late Pamela Browning sings Another Hundred People beautifully and we get to see most of Beth Howland's (Vera on the TV sit-com Alice) seminal rendition of the Sondheim gem Getting Married Today. I only wished that Pennebaker had released extra footage of more songs, more takes, more banter. The show is currently back on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in a wonderful redux revival starring Raul Esparza and Barbara Walsh directed by John Doyle. In this revival (cast album out soon I am sure) one gets to enjoy the music and lyrics in ways never before enjoyed because of the lack of focus on the visual aspects of the show. This DVD is a worthy testament to a brilliant classic multi-Tony-winning piece of marvellous musical theatre history.",1167782400,6,962,5.01875
1369498,5,B00004XS36,"I can't stop watching this documentary about the recording of the cast ablum of a wonderful musical Broadway show. And I found watching the film with the commentary was as entertaining as watching the movie without the talking heads.  The film quality of the transfer to DVD isn't perfect, but it's a minor flaw. To top it off, you listen to great songs by the great Stephen Sondheim. I fully recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the documentary about Bob Dylan, ""Don't Look Back,"" which was made by D.A. Pennebaker as well. Pennebaker just records what's in front of him and let's everything play out without manipulation. It's pure and simple and top-notch filmmaking.",1140998400,2,677,4.836206896551724
1369499,4,B00004XS36,"Company is, to say the least, an unusual show. What is it, really? Certainly a brilliant musical, by Stephen Sondheim. But it's taken a very special place in Broadway Lore, thanks in great part to the Cast Album that was recorded in front of D.A. Pennebaker's cameras.

If you're an aficionado of Broadway, you already know a lot about Sondheim. So, it's fascinating to see the young composer coaching his singers and consulting with the recording engineers during this marathon session from 1971.

It's a truly exciting and vibrant look at the process, shot entirely hand-held, with raw focusing and close ups on the vocalists. The performances are for the microphones, not the lenses, so you see quite a few candid moments throughout the evening, and this gives the film a heightened intensity, and even moreso because the whole thing runs just under an hour.

Still, if you have played and played the cast album, it's very refreshing to see the alternate takes shown here. Dean Jones emoting on ""Being Alive"" is as incredible a performance as you'll ever view, and Elaine Stritch's ""Ladies Who Lunch"" recording is the lynchpin on which this whole film is hung.

My only complaint about this DVD is the ""commentary"" track. Granted, this commentary track was done particularly well. Some statements were clearly scripted, like the ones that filmmaker Pennebaker makes at the opening. Also commenting are Hal Prince, Broadway Director extraordinaire, who has some interesting insights and Elaine, the superstar diva, just being her gabby self. They carefully drop comments in where it doesn't take away from the original interview moments in the film, and there's a minimum of rambling, which is all too typical of such tracks on other DVDs.

But the fact is, this commentary track should have been a complete and separate interview section, perhaps gathering a few more of the participants, and sitting them down in a room for a chat. It would have been another chance for Pennebaker to roll more film in revisiting this alchemical moment in time. Ah well, there's very little to complain about here!

If you're even mildly interested in documentary filmmaking, Broadway shows, Cast Albums or Sondheim, you know what you must do: Get this disc!

Highly Recommended!",1100131200,7,2266,5.026666666666666
1369500,5,B00004XS36,"This DVD is a valuable piece of Broadway history, as it documents the process involved in recording one of the landmark cast albums of all time, ""Company"". It is interesting to see the mechanics involved, naturally, but what sticks with you is the determination of these tired actors (they recorded on the Sunday after opening night, their day off) to get a permanent record of this brilliant, groundbreaking musical. It's fun to watch them subtly interact as if on stage.

It's also touching to see these actors as they looked thirty-four years ago-- Barbara Barrie before her harrowing cancer battle, Beth Howland and Charles Kimbrough before sitcom fame, Elaine Stritch before England, marriage, widowhood, and beating alcoholism. The intriguing backstage story of lead actor Dean Jones' impending departure from the show is still moving; his misery over a crumbling marriage back in California led to a deal with director Harold Prince to bring the show into New York-- then to leave the role to Larry Kert.

Certainly there are some wonderful performances captured here (Dean Jones, Teri Ralston's silvery vocals, Beth Howland's hysterical patter song, Pamela Myer's run through of what may be the greatest song written about New York, ""Another Hundred People""). But the centerpiece is indeed Elaine Stritch's struggle to get a good track down of what she has called her ""three-act play"", ""The Ladies Who Lunch"". On that memorable first night, her fatigue gets the better of her and nuance gives way to angry shouting. Her eyes, wide and wild with exhaustion, tell volumes. Her quiet, dignified exit to get rest while the orchestra records the backing track is pure theatre. And her triumphant return to the studio to nail the perfect take (indeed, the film documents the take that actually made the album) thrills. She must have known this would be ""the one"", as she made sure her hair was done and her makeup perfect (down to full false eyelashes)-- she looks beautiful and sounds spectacular. Stritch's present-day commentary protests that she had a matinee later that day, hence the full stage face. Whatever the reason, her tough-as-nails beauty shines.

The DVD's extras add a fun commentary (by Pennebaker, Hal Prince and a typically feisty Stritch) and photos from the original production-- I wish they had added more!

This is very much worth it if you are a student of theatre history or of theatre music.",1093305600,17,2420,5.0425

1369502,5,B00004XS36,"Stephen Sondheim's ""Company"" was a revolutionary show in the American Musical Theatre - not unlike ""Show Boat,"" ""Porgy and Bess,"" ""Oklahoma"" and ""West Side Story.""  It broke new ground and expanded the medium.  It set a higher standard.  Considering Sondheim's genius it isn't possible to label a single score his ""best"" or his ""masterpiece.""  Truly, when you listen to the various and varied Sondheim scores one inevitably thinks ""this is the greatest of his achievements"" - which is only true until you listen to the next score and find yourself having the same thought.  This DVD offers a unique look behind the scenes of the recording of the ""Company"" album.  All of the best remembered songs from the score are represented - ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy,"" ""Another Hundred People,"" ""The Little Things You Do Together, ""Being Alive"" and the incomparable ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" featuring Elaine Stritch's knock-out performance.  If you love Sondheim or Stritch or the American Musical, you shouldn't be without this DVD.  Order it now!",1051401600,7,1041,5.08235294117647
1369503,3,B00004XS36,"This DVD was great, I watched it smiling and singing along to all the wonderful lyrics by the master Stephen Sondheim.
When I ordered it I was under the impression that it was a stage production recording. I looked over it again and found that it was a film of them recording the cast album for the musical of Company. I was no less eager to still see the film.
I enjoyed the camera work of Pennebaker, he was able to catch the mood of the actors and actresses that were certainly giving all that they could to make this record work. It was also wonderful to see Stephen in his element - making words to music to work. As I said he is the master.
Portions of the film are quite humourous, most of it though is quite serious as they are only recording this in one night and finishing late in to the morning.
One thing I have learnt is that Elaine Stritch is one hell of a performer.
If you have listened to the original recording and want to see more, I would recommend this DVD.

7926347,5,B00004XS36,"This wonderful documentary by D. A. Pennebaker is a gift, not only for those of us who saw the original production (and remember it so well), but for all theater students and actors and everyone else - this is a lesson in seeing how theater works, in a way normally inaccessible to the public.  It is a beautifully crafted film, a seamless and invisible eye, following the creation of one of the greatest musical theater albums ever made.

It is a unique opportunity to watch a magnificent cast, director, musicians and writer/composer, all working together.  As Sondheim wrote in ""Sunday in the Park with George"" - 'Art isn't easy'.

I mention Elaine Stritch, who we see giving the ultimate rendition of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"", because I remember being completely blown away by her when I saw the original show.  What she goes through in this film is a lesson in tenacity, a quest for perfection, deep distress, frustration and humility at not producing it initially, and ultimate glee as she jumps around the recording studio, knowing she has finally knocked it out of the ballpark.  Yesss!!!

This documentary is a fundamental part of world theater history.  Cherish it.",1465689600,,1173,4.85929648241206

All of the original cast members are on this film, and it is quite amazing to see them performing what will be the definitive version of each song.  Dean Jones is a standout on ""Being Alive"", and Elaine Stritch shows the frustration involved in getting ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" just right.

7926353,5,B00004XS36,"""Original Cast Album--Company"" was one of the most famous theater documentaries ever made. It gave an insightful, lacerating look at the frantic process of taping a CD in an eighteen hour session. ""Company"" the musical is an edgy view of a group of alienated, neurotic, brittle Manhattanites in a hectic, striving, stressful environment, and it's not a soothing experience to see the taping session. Don't get me wrong: it is a great show, a great album, and it was a groundbreaking show that opened up new vistas for Broadway musicals.
But at this taping you don't see any fun or joy in putting together a work of art. You do see a group of highstrung, up tight, a-retentive people at their worst. Stephen Sondheim particularly, constantly smoking, pacing, shows the underside of a perfectionist. At one point he notices that a note has been changed by one of the singers; at another point he insists on exact pronunciations of his lyric. We know he's a genius, but does he think that anyone other than he would recognize these minuscule changes? I thought, what if I were working for this guy? The taping director is also a taskmaster.
These are not a group of happy people. Hal Prince shows a meaner streak in this enterprise. When I heard the recording director say ""Take Ten"" at one point I cringed--to think of going take after take in such an exhausting session. It was agonizing watching Elaine Stritch struggling to get everything right with ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" Dean Jones also gave several takes of the song ""Being Alive.""
In an October 23, 2010, Stephen Holden in the NY Times review of Marilyn Maye's cabaret act, says of the 82-year-old singer that she sings Jerry Herman songs and others, and he says she is ""the opposite of the kind of high-strung, insecure, narcissist diva."" These adjectives could apply to Sondheim's songs and his characters in ""Company."" Holden went on to say that Maye made ""a brief visit to the catalog of Stephen Sondheim, who, in some ways is her opposite in temperament.""
The music, the songs are great and truly memorable, and the finished album is a work of art. Many of the songs are memorable. This is a very instructive and wonderful documentary. Sondheim is s genius of the American musical genre: his music is intricate and often beautiful, and his lyrics are clever, innovative, and superbly crafted.",1287964800,,2353,4.798029556650246

This is one of the reasons why I am so grateful for the existence of this documentary.

When I heard the CD for the first time, I was struck by the timelessness of the concepts presented in the music.  But seeing the DVD of the cast recording changed my perspective entirely.  The original presentation of this show clearly did capture the essence of an era, (early 1970's) and the notions and attitudes prevalent at that time.

What a pleasure to see young Charles Kimbrough, Barbara Barrie, Beth Howland, and Dean Jones.  And I could spend hours watching Elaine Strich rant and rave, had she been born later, she surely would have been a big reality television star!
