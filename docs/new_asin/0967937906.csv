1175125,3,0967937906,"The video is extremely short, only 30 minutes, and covers only the bare basics and principals of Wing Chun. While the basics and principals are important I felt that this video was some type of self promotional tape and  of limited value except to a brand new student of Wing Chun. The parts  showing the Sil Nim Tao form from multiple angles, front & side, could  have been a whole lot better if the camera had been closer or if they had  included an additional section to the video showing a closer view of the  hands, wrists and arm movements. Overall: the video is just too short, of  limited value except to a new student or someone who wants to review the  bare basics, the camera is too far away from the subject most of the time,  the para-military uniforms (especially the caps) did not sit well with  several other people who viewed the video with me, and finally, the video  could of gone into greater detail of the subject matter that it did cover.",963014400,6,960,4.434285714285714
1175126,5,0967937906,"I have been waiting for this video!  Because of my schedule, I don't have the time to train at a Wing Chun school.  I have bought many of the other Wing Chun video's and they have not been clear enough for me to follow  along.  They usually have the same two guys in the same room for thirty  minutes demonstrating technique's that only a student of Wing Chun could  pick out.  Wing Chun Today is very thorough, and very detailed.  This video  is very easy to follow and corrects the faulty technique as you go.  With a  combination of beautiful scenery and detailed instruction, Wing Chun Today  will keep you interested to the end!",960076800,4,633,4.456140350877193
1175127,5,0967937906,This is the most complete martial arts video available today.  Master Lau provides the viewer with an accurate historical tour through the Wing Chun system to his own development of the training center in Atlanta Georga.  This video presents the basics of the Wing Chun style in great detail.  The  importance of detail and securing the basic forms are well demonstrated  throughout this video.  This training tape would equally benefit beginers  and advanced students alike. I am really looking forward to the next video!,956448000,2,522,5.142857142857143
1175128,5,0967937906,"This video has it all. It starts with a history of the wing chun system and leads into basic concepts. There are technical instructions on how to find the correct training stance and shows the Sil Nim Tao from multiple  angles. There isn't much left to chance if you want to to see correct forms  training. It goes on to show the correct method of basic walking, shifting,  and Don Chi. The narration is excellent and there are many technical points  that are made. For example, common mistakes are shown and what should be  done to correct them. This is an excellent video for the beginner, as well  as a technical reference for the experienced practitoner.",956275200,4,658,4.629310344827586
1175129,5,0967937906,"I have been in martial arts for over 10 years and surely there is no substitution for training in a real martial art school with real partners. On the other hand a great instructional video can benefit all  serious students of martial arts. One of the most important reason to own  such a video is that there is very few truly great masters around who  actually has the experience and knowledge what Master Jason Lau has. When  someone recommended his instructional video I did not think much of  it. After watching it I was very impressed and motivated. Not only Sifu Lau  showes many different ways to train,but he showes how to do it more  efficiently. I truly recommend his video ""Wing Chun Today"" to  anyone who wants to take a different look at martial art training. Beginners  or advanced students can benefit equally from this great video.",955497600,4,847,4.668918918918919
1175130,5,0967937906,This is absolutely the best Wing Chun video I have seen. It is professionally directed and edited to provide the student with a clear understanding of the techniques being presented. Jason Lau's presentation  is both informative and entertaining. It is the next best thing to having  Jason Lau as one's personal teacher. I eagerly look forward to the next  installment.,954892800,,369,5.116666666666666
1175131,5,0967937906,"Finally! An insturctional video that is entertaining and educational.  I must say that this is by far the best martial art tape that I have seen in a long time. ( it's animated; not stationary; and it was actully edited to  a professional level)  I am glad that this video was reccomended to me.  I  have made it part of my curriculm for all my students, beginners and  advanced.  For the beginners the stance, shifting and advancing drills are  excellent.  The woman who demonstrated the 1st form did an excellent job,  and we Wing Chun martial artists know the importance of a proper form.  As  for the advanced student it can help by simply showing you how to teach,  just as master Jason Lau does in a very effective but light hearted way.  I  can't wait to see the next video, i.e. the 1 inch punch.  Lets bring the  fame of that punch back to where itcame from ""Wing Chun""!  Keep  up the tremendous effort.",952992000,6,912,4.418181818181818
7901962,3,0967937906,"I really think that all people that put one star and criticize this video are obviously part of others school as that dude from hong kong which talk about taking down students but then he doesnt have balls to write his real name . The video it is obviously a demo : a video can only be an introduction to any kind of art . Anybody who buy a video thinking that watching it he is going to learn professionally any kind of art is just an idiot who deserve to be disappointed : especially in art as kung fu , massage or any other area which needs years of practice and serious personal teaching .I've personally met Jason Lau as well many years ago ,Mr. de Broekert, and I'd like to know in what kind of situation you've met him .
Let me tell you something , not only he's a very loyal fellow but a very skilled deadly trainer .
Again Mr.de Broekert , no offense ,but yes there is a lot of street as you said but in the jungle in the one-o-one fight you have no time to play Matrix but only be as "" street "" as you can if does help.
Again to the ANONIMOUS from Hong Kong , please , sign your critics in order to avoid being considerated  a creation of the intellighenzia .Thanks..
By the way , I've never liked particularly martial art but I met Jason Lau 22 years ago and only who was with him at that time knows why his students wears that uniform and there is nothing to laugh about but instead a lot to respect .",1078272000,,1413,4.046428571428572
7901963,1,0967937906,"Jason's ego is certainly a driving force for all that he does. I met him many years ago and have to agree with the previous reviewer about his self-promotion. There is a lot of street in Jason and it shows in his approach to training and promotion of the style. I trained with Sifu Francis Fong for years and feel that you are better off finding a better source of information about the style than this video, such as a good school in your area.
Jason does have a beautiful looking school, however the beauty does not hide the fact that the school is used as a conduit for self-promotion such as the two videos that Jason has produced. Additionally, how in the world does a 30 minute video cost $30? Save your money.",1072224000,4,716,4.350746268656716
7901964,5,0967937906,"I am a student of Wing Chun in Brooklyn NY. In the past, I have been mostly dissapointed with martial arts videos; either they try to pack too much into a video so you can't follow what's going on, or they offer too little for the would-be-student. When my friend told me I had to see this video, I was skeptical, but consented. Boy was I impressed! The video was done very well (not like many others that seem to have been done in someone's basement) and Sifu Lau's explanation of basic concepts were quite lucid, as were his explanations highlighting some of Wing Chun's basics. His sense of humor and dynamic presence made the video more interesting as well. The demonstration of the Sil Lum Tao by one of his students was excellent, textbook done! I think I'll have to get my own copy now. (By the way, I hear there is a 2nd volume coming out. If it's as good as this one, send it to me now!)",997401600,,896,4.276470588235294
7901965,2,0967937906,"I was very disappointed in this video as a Wing Chun training guide. It is more of a documentary \advert on Jason Lau and his excellent looking training facility. The video shows the first form but doesn't examine each move and its application in depth.
This video is not useful as a training guide for Wing Chun. Either attend Jason's school or another Wing Chun teacher. If you have no access to Wing Chun teachers, Wong Shun Leung's video 'Wing Chun - Science of infighting' or Leung Ting's 'Authentic Wing Tsun' are much more informative and useful to non wing chun practitioners wishing to learn the Sil Lim Tau.
I am in no way trying to detract from Mr Lau's excellent reputation and skill in Wing Chun. I feel that previuos reviews have mislead me, not Mr Lau's video or organization. As a video it is relatively well produced and shows off Mr Lau's school, which is the best looking Martial Arts training facility I have ever seen.
Only buy this video if you are interested in studying with Mr Lau or only want a 'rough' idea of what Wing Chun entails ( or collect all Wing Chun material like me ). Don't buy this if you want to learn the Sil Lim Tau and apply it.
For reference I am a Wing Chun student of many years. I have studied Randy Williams Wing Chun Close Combat System and Wong Shun Leungs Wing Chun. I have an extensive collection of Wing Chun books and videos, from many different Wing Chun lineages.",983145600,39,1420,4.444444444444445
7901966,5,0967937906,"This scenic Atlanta-based video covers the basic Wing Chun stance, the triangle and centerline theories, Sil Lum Tao, beginning single-hand Chi Sao, as well as much, much more. The video was relatively short, but the quality and quantity of the video was outstanding. I would recommend this video for beginning to advanced Wing Chun practitioners because it introduces perfect technique for beginners, and emphasizes the importance of the basics for the more advanced students. This video is also an excellent training tool for teachers to effectively explain the theory and relevance of the Wing Chun philosophy.",974678400,6,613,5.395833333333333
7901967,1,0967937906,I was very unimpressed with the video. It was very short on wing chun basics. If your looking to learn wing chun from a videotape.  Go look for Augustine Fong's instructional videos.,969580800,5,182,4.6875
7901968,1,0967937906,"The video is way too short for an instructional tape, barely 30 minutes,  and covers only the very basics of the basics in Wing Chun. While the  basics of the basics are important, but I felt that this video was more of  a self promotional tape than anything else. It have very limited value  except to a new student or someone who wants to know the bare basics. And  what up with the military uniforms and the caps?!? Reading some of the past  reviews, I can't help but wonder who are these reviewers, friends or  students? It was entertaining at first, but it soon go downhill afterward.  It promise a lots in the beginning but couldn't deliver at the end! And the  students in the video don't seem to be having fun. (Learning is fun!) Its  sure not worth the $29.95 price tag!! I would rather spend me money on a  good action's movie for two (w/popcorn & soda). (From the Director: ...  also an excellent training source for the more advanced practitioner....)  Get lost Wayne brothers! Now, that's Funny!! The next video also look  promising!? I can't wait...;-(",968198400,8,1066,4.571428571428571
7901969,5,0967937906,"I'm normally not in the habit of picking up an instructional tape, especially when it comes to Martial Arts, because the quality of the video  is never quite as good as I hope it to be. However, this isn't the case  with Sifu Lau's Wing Chun instructional tape.  Even though the tape is only  30 minutes long, so much information is showned and taught that it'll  probably make you want more. I can't wait for the next volume to come out.",967766400,3,438,4.3580246913580245
7901970,2,0967937906,I think this video should of been a lot longer its to much money for only 30 min. it goes into detail but not step by step and it is very basic,964656000,7,143,3.5
7901971,5,0967937906,"I have been studying wing chun for nearly two years now.  I found Sifu Lau's tape extremely useful.  I stuck the tape in my VCR, and was amazed at the organization/discipline of Sifu Lau's students.  I was also very  impressed by Sifu Lau's credentials.  After watching the tape I remembered  how my instructor rapidly taught me the basics of wing chun, and little  time was spent focusing on the details.  Sifu Lau's tape highlighted many  details that I had neglected in my initial training.  After instituting the  new level of detail to my basics I was very please to find that my advanced  techniques improved as well.  I feel I wasted a lot of time in breezing  through the basics - as many of my advanced techniques just would not work  correctly no matter how hard I tried.  The tape is very useful for advanced  students seeking additional detail for their basics, and is also very  useful for beginners as well.  I look forward to Sifu Lau's next tape, and  would one day like to visit the school in Smyrna, GA.",963532800,4,1021,4.535911602209945
