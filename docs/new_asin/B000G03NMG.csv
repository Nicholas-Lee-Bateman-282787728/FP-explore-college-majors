8128071,1,B000G03NMG,The worst purchase I've made this year on Amazon----horrible---the graphics are stupid as are the sound effects. The music played throughout is even worse -- not Halloween related at all. Save your money!,1256342400,,204,5.212121212121212
8128072,5,B000G03NMG,"This is a fantastic dvd for a party atmosphere.  Sound effects are great and the pumpkins are very humerous.  I love it and can't wait to start the party off right!  This is not a dvd to sit down and watch from start to finish, more for use as party atmosphere.",1192579200,8,261,4.078431372549019
