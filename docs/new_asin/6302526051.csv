476501,4,6302526051,"I have heard about this version of ""Dracula"" for years and have finally managed to track down a copy to watch.  As everybody knows (otherwise where are they reading these reviews?), while Universal was making the Bela Lugosi version of ""Dracula"" during the day, the studio made a second version in Spanish at night.  They had already made a Spanish version of ""The Cat Creeps"" (released in Mexico as ""La Voluntad del Muerto""), which was a big success and made actress Lupita Tovar a star.  Tovar was quickly signed for the female lead of ""Eva"" in ""Dracula,"" with Carlos Villarias (or Villar) as the Count, Barry Norton as Juan Harker, Eduardo Arozamena as Abraham Van Helsing, and Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield.  The Spanish version follows the same script as the Lugosi version, however director George Melford used more mobile camera movement than Tod Browning, resulting in a film that is more dynamic and also more atmospheric than the Lugosi classic.  Basically, your preference between the two films is going to come down to which you consider more important, the acting or the direction.  Lugosi has the more compelling performance as Dracula, although Tovar's sexuality is a striking part of the Spanish version.  However, I think the better job of directing is clearly demonstrated by Melford, so I end up giving his picture the edge.  Obviously this makes a very interesting double feature and if you have enjoyed the 1931 Universal classic horror film you should definitely check this one out sometime.",1002153600,2,1515,4.984126984126984
476502,5,6302526051,"The Spanish version of DRACULA received so much publicity (mainly claiming it's superiority to the Tod Browning/Bela Lugosi classic) that I avoided this archival release for years. Well, I'm happy to say that I was mistaken. This marvel is one last classic from Universal's horror heyday. True, the star is no Bela Lugosi--but the Spanish Renfield rivals Dwight Frye without ever imitating him. Best of all, you get a chance to see what Browning's film could have been like without any cuts. It is impossible to downplay the value of this alternate version. A true treasure for film buffs.",999129600,6,589,4.959595959595959
476503,5,6302526051,"This film was done at the same time as the one with Bela Lugosi and by the same company and this film is about 20 minutes longer.  It is every bit as good as the Lugosi version as far as the story,sets, etc.., because they used the same sets. The film has a little different feel because of a german director's mark made on this film. The only thing it needs is the charisma that Bela Lugosi has because Carlos Villarias is ok as Dracula but it's just not the same. I highly recommend this film for your collection. I enjoyed the characters better in this version a little more with the exception of Bela lugosi and Dwight Fry. I had never seen this movie until i saw it on AMC's Monsterfest in October of 2000. It's a blast so enjoy!!",979430400,5,735,4.212765957446808
476504,4,6302526051,"I'm probably going to start a riot by saying this, but I almost liked this version of DRACULA better than Lugosi's. Though it was shot on the same sets as that version and virtually every shot is the same as the famed Lugosi movie, there are some vast differences between this Spanish language version of DRACULA and the English language version. For one thing, the women are much more sensual and alluring and it's easy to see why Dracula would be so tempted by them. Also, even though this version recreates virtually every shot of the Lugosi film, the film runs almost 30 minutes longer, featuring prolongued moments of terror and offering up some creepier, more disturbing atmosphere. However, even though Carlos Villarias is effective in the role, he's no match for Lugosi. But then again, who is? Yes, I think Lugosi is still the definitive screen vampire, so naturally I think his DRACULA is the best, but this version isn't far behind.",972950400,3,943,4.791411042944786
476505,4,6302526051,"If you are a fan of the Bela Lugosi ""Dracula,"" you owe it to yourself to check out this Spanish version, shot at night by George Melford on the same shots Todd Browning was using during the day.  Granted, Lugosi is a better Count than Carlos Villar, but the two things that really sell this alternative version of the tale are the cinematography and production values, decidedly more creative and eerie than the English version, and the wickedly vamp out women, led by Lupitar Tovar.  Endure the subtitles and screen these two 1931 ""Dracula"" movies as a double-feature.",970444800,3,569,4.795918367346939
476506,3,6302526051,"Until the release of the DVD for 1931's Dracula I was not aware of the existence of the Spanish language version, being familiar only with Tod Browning's. From that standpoint alone (novelty) it was worth buying. Upon  viewing, and in consideration that I haven't seen the Lugosi version in  twenty years, I was not disappointed, albeit for unexpected reasons. The  Browning Version with its lack of continuity, ponderous cinematography and  disjointed narrative fails to live up to its reputation -by virtue of  nostalgia one must assume- as one of the all time greats of horror.  Luckily, the Spanish version was artistically independent having a  different cast crew and director from the English one. Much of the success  of this production must be attributed to Director George Melford who  maintains a narrative form which flows more smoothly, free of the abrupt  edits that plague his opposite number. The English version at 1hr 15min  suffers from being overly edited either at the insistence of the studio or  the censors, one can only guess which is held to account. At 1hr 44min the  Spanish editor, Arturo Tavares, manages to accomplish smooth cuts and  transitions which are visually seamless. Continuity is thus enhanced  producing a more even flow of action than Browning's print. Furthermore the  cinematography of George Robinson displays a surprisingly greater  sophistication than the renowned Karl Freund's English shoot. Much better  use of reverse and tracking shots assist in breaking the traditionally  static images familiar to the silver screen era. In short, technically, the  Spanish version far surpasses its English clone. Melford also had the  upperhand in being able to view the dailies of the simultaneous Browning  version, see their mistakes and improve on them. Carlos Villar, as Dracula,  was the only member of the Spanish cast allowed to view these rushes. It  was a colossal error. The problem with Lugosi's performance was his overly  theatrical style with its flourishes of posturing and gesticulations.  Villar tries too hard to out-Bela Lugosi. Consequently, his take on the  Count is eccentric to a ludicrous extent. He is also true to the gaudy  thespian craft of silent screen peformance which dictated that an actor  must act with his eyes and facial contortions to convey the emotional  inflections that are lost in the absence of the aural experience. What  results is comic in its execution and whereas Lugosi makes one wince at the  amateur theatrics, Villar illicits a mocking laugh, which is not advisable  in a horror flick. This is the Spanish version's only major flaw, but it is  a fatal one dramatically, because the movie depends upon our belief in the  menacing aspect of the lead character. However the negative affect of  Villar's hammy performance is offset by the delights of the Latino female  leads, notably Lupita Tovar and Carmen Guerrero, who exude a sexuality not  latent in their Anglo counterparts, and they are allowed a greater latitude  to explore the sensual aspects of the drama. When Juan Harker gazes  longingly at his beloved Eva we understand his emotive state because our  eyes are transfixed also. The plunging neckline and the barely contained  bosom assist quite nicely, thank you. Apparently the censors cared little  for protecting the moral standards of their Spanish cousins, thankfully,  else these scenes would have ended up on the cutting room floor. But when  one says that this version of Dracula is the better of the two, that is no  great boast as neither would stand the acid test of a modern audience. As  horror it fails miserably but as drama is succeeds enough to give it a  marginal recommendation. But its primary benefit is to students of filn for  whom it will provide a valuable resource.",947376000,17,3795,5.082792207792208

7827103,5,6302526051,"While Universal's DRACULA was being filmed in the daylight hours, a lesser-known classic was also taking shape as night fell on the studio backlot. In almost every way (save for Bela Lugosi's iconic performance), the Spanish-language version of DRACULA is the superior film. Using the same costumes, script, and sets as the English version, it would seem that the end result would be very similar, however there are many distinct differences that set the two films apart. George Melford's DRACULA is filled with romanticized performances from each of the expressive cast members, lead by the beautiful and enchanting Lupita Tovar playing Eva Seward (this version's Mina). Likewise, Melford and cinematographer George Robinson explore each of the sets with more artful enthusiasm than the Browning/Freund team. Carlos Villaras would star as this version's Dracula, and while he is very good, some of his more comical movements and mannerisms may have resulted from his instructions to imitate Bela Lugosi's performance. Still, he brings an air of sophistication and menace of his own that allow him to excel in the role. The Spanish DRACULA cannot be overlooked by fans now that it is available in wide circulation, and it is should be considered right alongside the English version as a classic of its era.

7827104,4,6302526051,"This film is a wonderful surprise.  Made at exactly the same time as the classic version with Lugosi on the same set, this version is composed completely of hispanic actors.  Though I prefer the Lugosi version, this is a complete success, in particular the insane Renfield character.  The dracula is also very good, as is the young victim he is stalking.  I would recommend this for any fan who wants a new wrinkle on the series that s/he didn't know existed.",1291939200,,459,4.62962962962963
7827105,4,6302526051,"This Spanish version was filmed at the same time as the English version (same sets). The actors and costumes were different. The subtitles are in English. The film opens with a coach in the Carpathian mountains. [The word ""coach"" comes from the town where is was invented, Kcs in Hungary.] They hurry to reach the inn by nightfall. One man wants to reach Borgo Pass and go to Dracula's castle! Are the peasants superstitious? Or do they know local conditions? Dracula rises at night, so do his wives. Renfield arrives at his destination. [The hinges need oiling.] ""Soy Dracula."" The children of the night make beautiful music to his ears. ""You are very kind."" All correspondence has been burned as requested. [No paper trail?] Was there something in that wine? The ship arrives after a terrible storm. A lone madman survived.

Dracula visits the opera. Can he work his will on a servant? Carfax Abbey is next to Whitby sanitarium. Is there something worse than death? Lucia finds Dracula fascinating. ""Sweet dreams."" The fog gets thicker. A bat flies into the room. Miss Weston dies after a baffling loss of blood. Two small wounds are found, like on the other victims. A diagnosis is made that is astonishing. Professor Van Helsing knows the symptoms. Will past superstitions become scientific truths? What about Renfield? He likes flies! Eva tells Juan she is frightened of the night. Aconite (wolfsbane) keeps wolves away. What does Eva have on her neck? The mirror does not reflect Dracula's image! The Professor knows a lot. ""Dracula es nos vampiro."" Renfield gives his performance as the madman under the power of evil. ""Don't ask me that!""

Eva is still alive but in grave danger. A mysterious lady in white offers candy to children then bites them on the neck. Eva saw Lucia after she was buried. They placed aconite around Eva's room to keep Dracula away. Van Helsing explains his deductions. To save Eva they must destroy Dracula. Does Dracula have hypnotic powers? Eva has never felt better in her entire life. [Diet or exercise?] Can Dracula command Van Helsing? Where did that big bat come from? What is the matter with Eva? Harker and Van Helsing go to the Abbey to find Dracula. They do what they have to do to rid the world of this menace. ""Dracula esta muerte por siempre."" And there is a happy ending for commercial success.

This film is worth watching as a variation on the better known English version. It shows the diffences made by the actors. I think Bela Lugosi was best as ""Conde Dracula"". Since wolfsbane (aconite) is a poisonous plant it was changed to garlic in the sequels. Those who read the original book can comment on the changes for the films.",1243900800,,2678,4.754838709677419

7827107,3,6302526051,"Language was no barrier to Hollywood in the silent era: title cards were easily translated from English.  When sound began to roar, Hollywood began to fear the loss of its foreign markets--and so, for a brief time, the studios occasionally produced two versions of certain films, one in English and one in another language, most often German or Spanish.  Such was the case with the 1931 DRACULA.

According to film historian and author David J. Skal, producer Paul Kohner fell in love with Mexican-born actress Lupita Tovar (they later married), and his romantic interest prompted the suggestion that she star in a Spanish-language version of the film.  When the English language cast wrapped for the day, the Spanish language cast arrived and worked through the night using the same sets.

Most of Hollywood's foreign-language duplicates were forgotten as quickly as they were released, but the Spanish DRACULA would be the exception. Todd Browning, who directed the English language film starring Bela Lugosi, was extremely uncomfortable with sound technology.  While the first fifteen minutes or so his film are exceptional, the movie thereafter becomes a filmed stage play--and a very choppy and rather unimaginative stage play at that.  Instead of simply duplicating Browning's set-ups, producer Kohner and director George Melford set out to best him, and when the Spanish version debuted most viewers declared it greatly superior to the English version.

And in many respects it is.  Whereas Browning's version is visually flat and rather slow, the Spanish DRACULA is visually exciting, and although it is considerably longer than the English version the pace never drags.  It also has it all over the Browning version in terms of editing, and it has a cohesion the Browning version completely lacks.  The supporting cast is also quite fine, with Lupita Tovar a standout, easily besting Helen Chandler's remarkably tiresome performance in the English version.

But the Spanish DRACULA has a problem, and it's a big one: actor Carlos Villarias, billed here as Carlos Villar.  Villarias had a respectable film career throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but he met his match in Dracula; where Lugosi intoned, snarled, and endowed the vampire with an elegant evil, Villarias goes through the film with a series of expressions that lead one to believe he has just encountered an overflowing toilet.  His flaring nostrils and disgusted glances are so incredibly out of place that they quickly become unintentionally hilarious.

Lugosi's performance, of course, is generally considered the ultimate statement of the role, and with good reason.  In a perfect world, we would be able to snatch Villarias out of the Spanish DRACULA and insert Lugosi in his place; the result would be a truly amazing film from start to finish.  As it is, however, we are stuck with Villarias, and frankly he bites.

The VHS release of the Spanish DRACULA is out of print, but the film is available on the same disk with the Universal release of the more widely known Todd Browning version.  By and large the film quality is remarkably good; it has not, however, received a digital remaster, and at least one of the reels would greatly benefit from it.  If you are a fan of 1930s horror, you'll find it more than worth the effort, but I suspect more casual viewers will be reduced to hysterical laughter by the Villarias performance.

7827108,2,6302526051,"True, Carlos Villar's performance as Dracula is this movie's greatest fault. I disagree with the statement that Villar's acting improved as the movie wore on. In earlier scenes I felt he was actually pretty impressive. Villar's approach to Dracula was very different from Lugosi's. Bela's Dracula had a magisterial, imposing presence. It was easy to believe this man had been a king, a general. Lugosi's Dracula was so smooth it was shocking when he'd display anger. Villar, by contrast, plays Dracula as much more feral. When he's not around others - on his own time, so to speak - his facial expression is animal-like. The polished aristocrat is only a facade, used when necessary, whereas in Lugosi we see a true aristocrat with a - usually - well-controlled feral aspect to his personality. Villar's is an interesting take on the character, and to start with it worked well for me, especially as a contrast to Lugosi's interpretation. Unfortunately there's a certain unfinished cast to Villar's features, an almost childlike softness and roundness, and later in the movie, when he's attempting to look intense and dangerous, what he really looks like is a pouting, sulky child.

One major gripe I had with this film concerns the first time we ever see Dracula. An important moment to get right, one would think. Scene: the interior of Castle Dracula, the Count's coffin sits in the middle of a gloomy, expansive room - which we will see again in the closing scenes. The coffin lid raises slightly, a hand moves out into the air. So far, so good. If it had been left at that, this would have been an underplayed, very effective scene. Apparently this was thought to be too boring - we actually needed to SEE Dracula here - so immediately is spliced in a scene, obviously taking place in completely different room (Carfax Abbey from later in the film), Dracula rises from his coffin. Only now it's not a coffin, it's a wooden packing crate, as it will be later in the film. Obviously different room, obviously different ""coffin."" I wanted to scream. Continuity, Melford! I'll give the director the benefit of the doubt this film splice was done or forced by the studio, but it's still shockingly amateurish editing, during one of the film's pivotal moments.

The special effects in the movie are better than Lugosi's Dracula. The bats are much more convincing and well-done that the famous - and beloved - rubber-bat-on-a-string of the English language version. Unfortunately the Spanish movie is ungodly slow, much more so than its more famous counterpart. It does, after all, take over 30 minutes longer to tell the same story. It's very talky. The acting, depending on the actor, comes in two varieties: stilted or totally over the top. All in all, a boring viewing experience.

I recognize the Spanish language 1931 Dracula for the important cultural curiosity it is. Every true vampire aficionado should have a copy of this movie in their library. As for me, I'm glad I saw it - once.",1062720000,,2991,4.8493150684931505
