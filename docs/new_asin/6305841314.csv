1084185,5,6305841314,I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it about 5 years ago. Regina King is so endearing and down right loveable in this film. She always does a great acting job. She's one of those actresses that really gets to me. She was fabulous in the movie Ray also. Courtney B. Vance is sexy and sweet for a killer. I recommend this film to those looking for an unconventional love story.,1375660800,,387,4.173333333333333

1084258,5,6305841314,I am a sucker for love and the underdog and I just love Courtney B. Vance and Regina King in this movie and as actors overall.  I work long hours most days so when I am off I enjoy watching movies and I will continue to add to my collections. If the movie is not already in my collection it was great being able to watch it on my laptop thru Amazon video watch.  The picture was clear and it was great relaxing in my favorite chair.  I recommend you watch if first and then buy it to add to your collection.  Thanks. JR,1350172800,2,519,3.9615384615384617

1084264,4,6305841314,"Good acting by Regina King & Courtney B. Vance, but this is not Kathleen Turner's & Ed Asner's best efforts. This suspense, romance, comedy is engaging, funny, & clever.",1236297600,,169,4.862068965517241

1084296,2,6305841314,What a sham; deadly dull  cheapie movie. There is dish wash action and dull humor; nothing to write home about.,1214870400,,111,4.55
1084297,5,6305841314,Great film.  I really like it.  It is just as advertised.,1181433600,,57,4.090909090909091
1084298,4,6305841314,"This is a movie that was recommended by an old aquaintance of mine. I am always sceptical when he recommends something because he will watch just about anything!  I was pleasantly surprised!!!  This is a wonderful movie and a ""must have"" for my collection. Should you decide to invest in this movie, you will not be disappointed.",1140393600,,329,4.754385964912281
1084299,5,6305841314,"I first saw this movie on cable a couple of years ago and wanted to own it immediately!  This movie is so cute and sweet.  Its a  funny love story with unpredictable action. Two great actors, Courtney Vance and Regina King, really work well together to make the story believable.  Luuuuuuv it!",1140393600,3,293,4.576923076923077
1084300,5,6305841314,"It was 5 am when I heard a voice that I love to hear.. Courtney B. Vance. He was in my home giving me a new movie to add to my library. Eddie (Vance) and Lois (Regina King) were the most balanced and well written charcters that I have seen in a long time. This movie has love, action, supense, a tear jearker and music that had me replaying a scene just to hear the piece. Of course, I would say this one selection should be their theme song.(When she first kisses him. I love it!)An award winner for music, drama/action and direction. I need to know if I could purchase the soundtrack? I have found the movie and I can stop renting it. Thanks. Godiva Anderson",1098316800,4,660,4.2047244094488185
1084301,4,6305841314,"I love, love, love this movie!  I caught it on cable late one night and I had to find it and buy it.  The plot has it all.  Suspense, romance, action and plot twists.  It is funny and you really like all of the characters, even the ones who may not be the nicest of people.  There is a stellar cast with Courtney Vance, Regina King, Ed Asner and Kathleen Turner all in roles that are somewhat different for them, which makes it even more fun to watch.  On a rainy Saturday afternoon, when you want to curl up with some food that is bad for you and a movie that is good to you, this is the one!",1085270400,2,593,3.9411764705882355
1084302,5,6305841314,"THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE, AND A GREAT LOVE STORY, I HAD A VERY HARD TIME FINDING SOMEONE WHO SOLD IT. THANK YOU B & N, I PLACED MY ORDER AND RECEIVE MY DVD VERY TIMELY. THE ACTORS WERE GOOD, IT WAS FUNNY ALSO ALONG WITH THE DRAMA. IT IS REALLY TOO BAD THE MOVIE WAS NOT REALLY PUBLICIZED WELL. I LOVED IT.",1070582400,3,303,3.8253968253968256
1084303,4,6305841314,"All I know is that the soundtrack caught me just as much as the movie. After the first three or four cuts, I was like I got to have the soundtrack!  And being a courteous fan of Regina King, by the first few scenes featuring her, I wanted the movie!  Courtney held his own as well!  All I know, furthermore, is that before the movie was half way over, I wanted both!
It was a great movie although the ending became predictable; but I didn't care because the solid R&B soundtrack carried the movie by this point.  They complimented each other.  While the movie is readily available, does anybody have the soundtrack?...LOL!",1027209600,7,622,4.517857142857143
1084304,5,6305841314,"The movie is great.  I have fallen in love with this movie.  The actors an the actresses that were picked for the parts are my favorites.

7896582,5,6305841314,If there was a 10 star I would have given it a 10 star. Courtney Vance is a sexy man him and Regina King made the perfect odd couple. I think I'm going to watch it again tonight.,1521676800,,178,3.710526315789474
7896583,5,6305841314,"I just love this movie, I wish it was just a bit longer or had a sequel. I really loved this movie, a professional hit man who has made a deal with God to even out his sin of killing. A young woman who is looking for love and they get setup on a blind date together. It's such a love movie!",1516665600,,290,3.693548387096774
