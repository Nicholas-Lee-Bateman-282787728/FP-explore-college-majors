4440325,5,B004OEX5SW,"Great fun!  This series is very enjoyable and entertaining to watch.  I love the educational content as well.  The Cat in the Hat takes Sally and Nick to all sorts of incredible places to learn about the way animals live.  Martin Short is very funny doing the Cat's voice.  This 3 pack is definitely the pack of DVDs you want to start with, especially if you are new to the series.  The price is great and it comes with plenty of episodes to enjoy.  Our favorite episodes from this 3 pack collection are:  Flower Power, Show Me the Honey, and You Should Be Dancing! My only complaint right now is that they do not have another collection like this for sale.",1323302400,11,657,4.371900826446281
4440326,5,B004OEX5SW,"This dvd set is great. It's silly fun and education for children. My son is 4 and loves these movies. And Martin Short is the voice of the cat, which is PPUURRFFFEECCCTTT!!! I would recommend this to every parent.",1323129600,,213,4.487179487179487
4440327,5,B004OEX5SW,My 4 year old triplets are in love with this show! I am so happy they are offered on DVD now. The animation is fun and looks just like what you would see in the Cat in the Hat book. The music is upbeat also.,1322784000,,207,3.6222222222222222
4440338,5,B004OEX5SW,"This set is ideal.  There are three DVDs, and each one has 5, 12-minute episodes (60 minutes total).  You can show the episodes one at a time, or all at once.  I love that the shows are educational.  The kids learn about beaver dams, the levels of the jungle, bees, ants, whales, hermit crabs, migration, and so much more.  My 2 and 4 year olds love these DVDs and learn some great science from them.  Thanks Cat!",1370304000,7,413,4.298701298701299
4440339,5,B004OEX5SW,"My children are preschool-aged and have loved the Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That ever since they could pull up on furniture and try walking. My oldest, who is not yet in Kindergarten, tells me important facts about pollination when we're working in the garden and facts about animals when we visit the zoo. She knows about the planets and creatures under the sea... and has learned all of this from the Cat in the Hat. We purchase ""The Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That"" DVDs whenever we see them in stores... and it all started with this set. Thank you, PBS Kids!",1367193600,2,575,4.284403669724771

4440341,5,B004OEX5SW,My one year old loves the Cat in the Hat. He loves the DVD's and the books.  They are funny yet teach at the same time.,1361577600,,119,3.576923076923077
4440342,5,B004OEX5SW,"Ok, if you have seen the show you know it is good and you know that kid's love this. So not much to say on that topic. Buying the set is a value over singles. Just make sure you haven't already bought the titles separately. I already bought this set once, but am buying a second set to give away!!",1360627200,,297,3.966666666666667

4440344,5,B004OEX5SW,We no longer have satellite to watch for TV.  My son loves Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That!  I decided to get him some DVDs to watch occasionally and he loves these.  It is a great price and you get a total of like 15 episodes!  I think it's like 5 episodes per disc.  Several hours of enjoyment and great quality too!,1346716800,,324,3.923076923076923
4440345,5,B004OEX5SW,"We don't allow much screen time so are very judicious about the DVDs we choose.  We prefer them to have some educational value whether it be moral (like the Berenstain Bears videos, which we LOVE), the John Deere kids DVDs (which our boys have loved from ages 2 now up to 6) or the Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That DVDs.  These are done beautifully and include great facts, fun music and clean and funny humor that our 4 and 6 year old boys adore. I will be shopping for more of these and believe that most kids (ages 2 to 10) would enjoy them.",1338336000,6,549,4.074074074074074

4440347,4,B004OEX5SW,"I got this set for my daughter for Christmas. She's 2 years old and watches the PBS airing of the same series. I'm not thrilled with Martin Short's Cat, but she's a big fan. The picture quality and product are very good to excellent.",1325808000,,233,4.318181818181818

8437199,5,B004OEX5SW,"Martin Short is a TERRIFIC voice for this cartoon. My kids loooove learning about nature and science with these videos! It's educational and very humorous so even if mom & dad are in the room watching it's enjoyable (no offense Dora...okay a lot of offense, your voice is like nails on a chalkboard). This is an A+ purchase.",1395619200,,324,4.603448275862069
8437200,5,B004OEX5SW,Much of programming for kids involves showing them bad behavior and then telling them it's wrong.  This material is very good for parents seeking wholesome and educational entertainment for their kids without teaching their kids wrong things.,1394409600,,242,5.54054054054054
8437201,5,B004OEX5SW,My grandson does not enjoy long car rides and this DVD really helped keep him entertained.  He would not fall asleep but he did not fuss!  He likes the DVD so I love it!,1381536000,,169,3.9411764705882355
