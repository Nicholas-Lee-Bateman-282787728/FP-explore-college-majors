8251229,5,B0013JBBBO,"I have owned the Ruscico version of this
film (gave it to my girlfriend), which, truth to tell, is far superior as far as
extras in concerned. However, this version,
which has only two extras, includes two
not included in the Ruscico version, a
discourse (apparently delivered from a park
bench) by the chief cameraman and a 60's
era film on the making of Voina i mir.
The downside for those who don't understand
Russian is that only Russian subtitles are
available on this edition. More remarkable
still is that this edition is NTSC, and it
is specifically stated on the packaging that it is to be sold only in the United States and Canada! Obviously, Krupniy Plan
was aiming for the Russian immigrant market
in these two countries.
  The subtitles are excellent and usually
reflect with great precision what the characters are actually saying. This will,
of course, be small comfort to those who
know no written or spoken Russian. I imagine the hard-of-hearing native Russian
speaker will be delighted.
  Nevertheless,an non-speaker of Russian who is thoroughly familiar with Tolstoy's novel should consider getting this 4-DVD set, simply because the picture and audio
are the best I have yet seen for this film.
Apparently, Krupniy Plan did some frame-by-
frame restoration after Mosfilm's original
restoration, so that their version seems
to outshine the Ruscico and to be even more
superior to Kultur's version. The latter
is, of course, appalling, especially since
it uses pan-and-scan.
  It would be interesting to see this Krupniy Plan version on blu-ray disc. Probably unlikely to happen, but one can always hope...",1307145600,9,1624,5.063670411985019
