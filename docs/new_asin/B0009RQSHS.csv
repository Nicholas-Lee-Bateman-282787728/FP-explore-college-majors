8065998,4,B0009RQSHS,"I would give one of the DVDs in this collection- the one on Jacob -zero stars if I could. The actor they chose to play Leah (wife of Jacob) was actually a man in drag complete with a beard and moustache (not making this up).

The DVDs all had the wrong labels on them e.g. The Saul and David DVD was labeled as Jacob etc...

The acting was mediocre in all of them but I felt like the DVD on Saul and David was better than the others, especially the depiction of Davids life on the run from Saul - that one I really liked and is why I rated this with 4 stars

If you enjoy bible DVDs some good ones IMO are:

Bible Collection DVDs -Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, David, and Daniel
The Living Bible Collection The Greatest Stories Ever Told (5 discs)- Old Testament, Acts of the Apostles, Jesus the Christ
The Gospel of John (Visual Bible International)",1471996800,,844,4.25625
