7012651,5,B00TL6QUV2,"I have watched this series on HBO at least 6 times. What an amazing gift you have given us Dave Grohl! It is the soul of America in music, it is a journey for Dave and the Foo Fighters, it sews together the fabric of our lives, and heals the soul. Maybe if we had more music and less red and blue states, we might all be united again. Music is the sound of our memories. Thank you to all who created this, thank you, thank you, thank you!",1425168000,,438,3.932584269662921
7012652,5,B00TL6QUV2,"Dave Grohl is an absolute genius for making this amazing documentary series. I am a huge Foo Fighters fan, but after watching this series I am now a fan of so many other artists that I never realized I would enjoy. Each episode dives into the story of how music evolved in each city they recorded in and also tells the story behind the recording studio itself. A lot of the history behind these cities and recording studios are really touching at times. I don't want to give too much away about the series itself but if you are a music lover and like history too, then this is a perfect series for you to watch.",1424908800,23,611,4.275862068965517

Dave Grohl is so cool and I love getting the back story for songs and getting to know the music history of each town directly from some of the people who were a part of the scene. This documentary broadened my music horizon. It introduced me to some awesome bands like Black Flag, Naked Raygun, Queens of the Stone Age and Minor Threat. I really hope that Dave Grohl does this again! Highly recommend!",1497052800,,432,4.551282051282051
7012656,5,B00TL6QUV2,"I learned so much from this! I can't wait to visit some of these places. My one critique is it tends to find some obscure musician who was well connected in the city's musical growth, and explores that person in great detail, rather than showing the breadth of influence of the city. Still very fascinating.",1495324800,,307,4.6

7012663,5,B00TL6QUV2,"This was a really well executed project by Dave Grohl.  He visits 8 cities around the USA to explore their musical history and the local cultural influences that make music vary by region, then ties them all back together to show how history connects all these different rivers of thought and sound.  The music styles covered were much more diverse than I expected, including a load of interviews with the artists who've lived and developed music scenes around the country, ranging from Ian MacKaye (punk) to Buddy Guy and Jimmy Vaughn (blues) to Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton (country) to Chuck D and LL Cool J (rap), Woody Guthrie's daughter Nora (folk), and many many more.",1484006400,,677,4.827586206896552

7012679,5,B00TL6QUV2,"This remarkable, unique collection of videos, from the 8-part documentary of the same name (CD available through Amazon) explores the musical history of 8 cities.  These are Seattle, Los Angeles, Austin, Texas, Chicago, New Orleans and New York City, Washington, DC, and Nashville.  The premise is that every city gains its own sound from the musical history that went down there.  The Foo Fighters spent a week in each city, interviewing and playing with many classic and contemporary artists.  The documentary's object is to teach music and its history on many levels.  However, the Foo Fighters wisely wrote and play one song per city that is based on the FF's style and approach.  Trying to 'sound' like each city, instead of like themselves, would have been a disaster.  The eight songs are masterful, incredibly creative, with an artistry more thoughtful than the FFs sound to date.  The lyrics show pure genius and are personal and moving.",1466726400,,946,5.019230769230769

7012682,3,B00TL6QUV2,"This series had so much potential but falls short in a big way due to self indulgence. It could have been a great and respectful tribute to the major music scenes, studios and artists of 8 major American cities, but it really became mostly a promotional tool to showcase the recording of the newest Foo Fighters album.

It was a cool idea to do an album by recording each song in a different city, each city having its own unique and popular contribution to American popular music. In each episode, we follow the band around and see a bit of the city, hear from a couple guest artists, waste a lot of time with the band as they goof around, and then watch them write and record a new song. We see just enough of each city to understand what Dave wrote into its song.

As well, only a select view of each city's music is presented, and too often the underground punk scene is the focus. An unbalanced amount of time is given to some local bands who influenced an underground music scene, while mainstream artists and music are simply mentioned, if at all. The worst episode is the Los Angeles one. Very little of the city's major music industry (the biggest of all) is mentioned, as it mostly focusses on the underground punk scene (that influenced Dave when he was younger and ultimately connects to Nirvana). The best episode is the Nashville one, as it's the most respectful of the city's heritage and the band gets out of the way more. Of the 8 chosen cities, 7 are obviously important musical cities. However, there are better choices than Washington (ex. Philadelphia).

Even though this series aired on TV over 8 weeks, it was likely filmed over a longer period and edited down. To write and record a new song every week for 8 weeks is a hard task, especially if each song is limited to specific content and styles. I do like the songs and I think they have some great riffs and melodies. I like the CD, although Foo Fighters fans have complained it doesn't sound enough like the Foo Fighters for their tastes. Which leads me to my last point...

This project was compromised. Someone making this must have thought that Foo Fighters fans wouldn't like watching a lot of music history stuff that sounds nothing like Foo Fighters. So they put minimal footage of each city's real music and inserted a LOT of useless footage in each episode of the band goofing around. Wasted potential! This series needs much tighter editing, and a LOT more footage and interviews to showcase each city's major music significance. Footage of the band goofing around, etc. should be moved to the bonus section as ""deleted scenes"".

Dave and co. have done a great job of keeping this off of YouTube and other free sites. Paying to watch episodes can cost as much as buying the DVD or Blu-ray set. The actual Blu-ray looks good and proclaims ""over 3 hours of extended interviews and never seen before footage""... the emphasis here is quantity over quality. Very little is worth watching. The Blu-ray (actually a 3-disc set) costs only slightly more than the DVD. The ads for this read ""Every city has a sound. Every sound has a story."" That entails the focus will be on telling the story of each music city. A more honest ad would say ""Every new Foo Fighters song has a city. Every new Foo Fighters recording has a story"". Not the same thing.",1463788800,,3325,4.553511705685619

The Sonic Highways album is amazing on it's own, but actually getting to witness the creative process and the ways in which each city shaped each song is mind blowing. Not only that, but they actually delve into the history of each city's major music scene, from blues to punk rock to country etc, and have interviews with the musicians that helped build or are a major part of their local music scene. It's incredible. My words aren't doing it justice. Just watch it. These guys got heart and soul.",1450569600,,728,4.6434108527131785

7012724,5,B00TL6QUV2,"Some reviews I have read suggested the the Foos were attempting to prop up a weak album with the whole video diary idea. I'm sorry but I cannot agree. This album is strong. This album touches parts of me that I know were intended by the author of the lyrics. Perhaps you are cynical or shallow and derive some twisted pleasure out of seeing the glass half empty. I choose to believe that Mr Grohl's intentions were more noble. I too long to see humanity change, grab ahold of the status quo and vigorously shake things up! Where are the artists. Where are the truly artistic and conscientious? The Foo Fighters are proving that they are both. It is refreshing to see and hear and experience. I like the next "" Love Shack"" as much as the next person, but it is nice to listen to intelligent lyrics say something important too.
 I have recorded my music. Not on the same echelon as the Foo Fighters but I understand what they are trying to do. There is so much more involved when you listen back to something that contains history for you. I have felt that with my own recordings and I am priveleged to say that I have experienced that insight with "" Sonic Highways"" as well. Thanks Dave.",1442534400,7,1186,4.390909090909091

7012740,5,B00TL6QUV2,Really well made documentary about many different genres of music. Dave Grohl is really making a name for himself when it comes to doc making. Can't wait to see what he puts out next.,1439683200,,183,4.411764705882353
7012741,5,B00TL6QUV2,"This is storytelling at it's finest.  This is a look inside how the songs for this album were conceived with very specific links so you can see where Dave got each line in every song from the interviews and experiences he had traveling across country.  Nashville, Chicago and Washington were my favorites, but beware of the Seattle one unless you have something to lift your mood when it is over.  As expected, Seattle is a somber and soul crushing stop and Dave has the courage to lay it all out.  Even if the Foos aren't your favorite, buy it for the history, for the interviews and especially for legends like Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Buddy Guy.",1439683200,,656,4.581196581196581

7012745,5,B00TL6QUV2,"Just an amazing series.  Some episodes are better than others, but as a whole this is still top notch.  Much of the musical roots of the cities are covered, and the depth addresses past racism, sexism and other struggles which ultimately went by the wayside when it came to damn good music.  The Seattle episode could have focused less on Nirvana, but what are you gonna do when you are Dave Grohl?  Loved every bit of this and have shared it with many music fans already.  Hoping Grohl does a second parter which covers other music cities like Gainesville,  Atlanta, Lubbock, San Francisco, Richmond, Memphis and more.",1439251200,,619,4.738317757009346

Dave Grohl may be the finest representative of rock music we've ever had.  He treasures the creation of this art and he's a treasure to all music fans.  His respect for everyone that contributes to the process of creating emotion through words and music shines through on the videos and if you haven't watched it, you've missed something special.",1438905600,,546,4.787234042553192

7012756,5,B00TL6QUV2,"I fell in love with this series when it aired on TV and so when I discovered that the DVD had bonus footage and extended interviews, I knew this had to be an addition to my collection.  I particularly like how each member of the band reconnects with their roots during the episode shot in their hometown/old stomping grounds.  It gave me a much deeper appreciation of the talent and depth that each member of the Foo Fighters possesses and also it presented a nice history lesson on the musical influences/culture of several major US cities.

I loved the Sonic Highways album as soon as it came out.  The songs are fantastic.  IMHO it is the Foo Fighters best work ever.

After watching the Sonic Highway series of shows I love it even more.  The series gives great insight into each song and shows were the lyrics came from and what they mean.  It makes the songs 100 times better.

The series itself is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  It is both entertaining and educational.

Well done Mr. Grohl, this series may be your legacy forever, and it is a great one.",1437264000,,559,4.401960784313726

7012778,5,B00TL6QUV2,"I watched all 8 episodes within 2 days and totally enjoyed this series. I love watching documentaries about music history and ""Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways"" can be classed as an excellent example as such.
Dave Grohl took the band on a musical journey around America. Visiting 8 cities, they spent a week in each recording a newly writtenGrohl composition inspired by his encounters with the people in the respective city.  Beyond the recording Dave totally explores the history of each city's music. This proves  to be rather enlightening, enjoyable and at times sobering and poignant. It can also stir some personal emotions as some of it seemed familiar to me.
The new songs are pretty good too and are all included on the album of the same name.
I recommend this thoroughly.",1435449600,,777,4.878787878787879

7012784,5,B00TL6QUV2,"This is without question a wonderful series for any true lover of music. I watched it as it aired each week on HBO. I then purchased the DVD set (with hours of extra materiel). The interviews with musicians, producers etc...are entertaining and the mini musical history of each city visited is very cool. Dave Grohl is so genuine and funny and is himself awestruck in many situations. He's the real deal. The end result of course is the music inspired by each of the 8 cities visited and it does not disappoint. I am a TOTAL music fanatic, but was never what you would call a huge Foo Fighters fan , but have become one since watching this series,  It not only gives you some great performances, but it makes you realize how the history of music in this country is disappearing, the creative process of music today is so ""detached"" and big business/big money are running the show in so many ways. The final show in the series in NYC...is almost scary when you see how hard it has become for actual recording studios to stay afloat and how much our society's ""It's all about the brand"" mentality is erasing the value of creativity. When a Starbucks on the corner is more important than creative, talented artists...there's a problem!",1434326400,,1232,4.6

My favorite scene is where he invites a clearly star-struck young fan into the studio and gives him a tour / treats him to a jamming session with his folks...Dave Grohl strikes me as a truly talented human being, not one of these 'wanna-be' posers who are all show/looks and zero talent/substance...take away the auto-cue and auto-tone and they would all sound very average.  Treat yourself to this musical feast!",1432684800,,773,4.804511278195489

7012869,5,B00TL6QUV2,"I watched the series on tv, but bought this mainly for the extra footage. If you're a Foo Fighters fan or a musician this is a great video! All of the episodes are included. Most of the extra footage is just that- the camera rolling on recording sessions and more of the interviews that were left on the edit room floor due to time restraints of the 1 hr format of the show. To me the great attraction to the series is getting in the head of the song writer (Dave Groth) and some history of the music in the region they record that song. Of course it is only one side of many music scenes of the regions. But still worth watching. Warning if you have small children I would watch it after their bed time- lots of 'F' bombs.",1430784000,,723,4.134751773049645

7012872,5,B00TL6QUV2,"When I heard that Foo fighters were making a documentary about music and their album I thought it was going to be a standard making of album, after seeing that Dave grohl was interviewing other musicians about their mucial influences and a whole song from the new album at the end of an episode I really enjoyed it",1430611200,,314,4.431034482758621
7012873,5,B00TL6QUV2,"A musical education of certain musical hubs of America. The idea came from Dave Grohl, leader of ""Foo Fighters"". He is not the kind of musician to do things the easy way or take short cuts. After acquiring one of the last Never analog recording desk, he had another artists break in the new board  by recording songs along with them. He also filmed this in the documentary ""Sound City"", along with a separate CD soundtrack. The Foo's then recorded their next album, ""Wasting Light"". It was their most successful album in 15 years. Sitting back on his laurels is something Grohl wasn't keen on doing. Rather than recording the follow-up album the same way in the comfort of his own studio 606, He took the band and equipment on the road for this ""Sonic Highways"" experiment. It could have easily blown up in his face but Dave & his band of Foo Fighters set the tour in gear. Choosing 8 cities know for their musical diversity. This was no easy task as you can see in this 8 part documentary. To add to the pressure, he gave himself a week to write the song with inspiration from each city and record the song before moving on to the next city!

Starting in Chicago...stopping along the way in Washington D.C. (Not far from Grohl's childhood home in Virginia), Nashville, Austin, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Seattle and NYC. Each song included a musical artist from the region of Grohl's choosing. The result is a very different, versatile  Foo Fighters album! In my opinion, this task is something no other band would undertake. Grohl is an inspiration. He finally comes to terms, at least on camera with the death of Kurt Cobain. He has come a long way from being just the drummer of ""Nirvana"".

I purchased the blu ray set and  the quality is perfect. There is a bonus 3 hours of extended interviews and never before seen footage on both DVD and blu ray editions. 8 songs, 8 studios, 8 cities, 8 episodes! Pure magic!",1430611200,16,1916,4.542028985507247

7012877,5,B00TL6QUV2,"As a musician, writer, storyteller, and creative professional, Dave Grohl has done something unique and inspiring in this documentary. As a long time listener, I appreciate this difficult but necessary creative endeavor. Dave says that going on tour used to be enough of an adventure but now he needs something more. I applaud his band and him going beyond the status quo to push the limits of their profession. In doing so, they not only put out a poignant and entertaining album, but shed a captivating light on the dark interesting corners of the music scene that average people seldom get to see. I highly recommend this to lovers of music, writing, creativity, history, and documentaries in general. It won't dissapoint.",1430006400,8,725,5.0

7012883,5,B00TL6QUV2,"I am an avid Foo Fighters fan, so my review will be biased to an extent. In this box set the Foo Fighters take a different creative approach to recording music. They picked 8 cities around the US and commited to writing 8 songs, recording one in each city. These recordings were done to create thier next album called Sonic Highways, but HBO decided to back them and couple a documentary to go with it.

In thier approach, Dave Grohl strategically picks studios in those cities, as well as people to interview. He interviews people who are part of the local music scene in that city, as well as famous musicians that came from those cities. Additionally, he selects one of those musicians to record with them in most of their songs. Although this documentary series is about the Foo Fighters recording thier next album, that only takes up about 25% of each episode. The other (roughly) 75% Dave Grohl focuses on the music scenes that developed in those cities and how the cities were changed because of it, & who was involved in making it happen and the big names that were spawn from there as a result.

This is an amazing series, filled with so much interesting music information. It is well worth the money and I highly recommend it.",1429488000,3,1236,4.563063063063063
