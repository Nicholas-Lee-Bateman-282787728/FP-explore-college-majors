5957386,5,B00EYRWUQW,"Joe Bonamassa and his band are a joy to watch in these four concerts from London.  You get a mix of acoustic and electric guitar playing that is definitely a feast for your ears.  These guys are very talented so if you're a guitar afficionado, you'll be in heaven!",1388361600,,264,4.36734693877551
5957387,5,B00EYRWUQW,"This set of London shows from earlier this year is a Tour De Force, to say the least! From the first show at Shepherd's Bush, to the finale at Royal Albert Hall, Joe and his varied bands and lineups shine brightly. What an amazing concept, and it was executed to perfection! Enjoyable from start to finish. If you are a Joe Bonamassa fan, you will not be disappointed by checking out this stellar historic boxed set of high def shows!",1388275200,,434,4.4375
5957388,5,B00EYRWUQW,Joe's the best. I've only seen excerpts of the shows...but if you go to Joe's site you can get the amp box set plus a T-shirt for $130. Just letting you know...check it out.,1388102400,6,173,4.117647058823529

5957390,5,B00EYRWUQW,"okay... my review of the set is below
first ...WHY and WHAT is this?  For the extra $60 compared to buying the BRs on their own what do you get? You get a very very cool container..unlike the picture it is actually like a MARSHALL Amp and is not cardboard but feels like an actual amp! ALSO it comes with a hard back 48 page booklet.  That is what you get for your extra $60.

I just picked up all four BR sets and am so thrilled. When I first saw these ""coming"" at my local record store (yes I'm lucky to have one near me Fingerprints in Long Beach CA) I thought, why bother putting out 4 videos from 4 shows on the same tour... and it struck me as overkill or as one review thought a runaway ego. Yesterday I picked them all up and noted that they are 4 shows, 4 different bands, 4 venues and 4 concepts..

They are all great and for different reasons, but they all share things in common, great visuals, great sound, great playing and great value for money. All come with 28 page booklets full of excellent pictures and information and all come with bonus features about the shows that are consecutive in nature (4 part making of that is interesting and ads about an hour to each DVD/BR).

Favorite moments for me are Joe's treatment of the late Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues"" both on his Blues night at Shepards Bush and his night at The Royal Albert Hall. Jeff Becks ""Spanish Boots"" played on a '59 Les Paul with Michael Rhodes on Bass and Anton Fig on Drums from the Trio/Borderline show is worth the price of the disc on its own! From the first show which features his TRIO days sound to the blues w/horns at Shepards Bush to the Rock show at Hammersmith and the final big night at the Royal Albert Hall these shows (ranging from 1 hour and 40 minutes to over 2 hours each) are wonderful expressions of a love of music by one of this generations greatest guitarists and for me to have this much classic Les Paul guitar playing is heaven.

I'd caution folks who think its too much, what would you give to have the same treatment by Gary Moore? Eric Clapton? heck...instead of highlights from the CREAM Reunion , what about a BR disc for every night? Complete? Would you want this from Peter Green at his best? Of course. I think that an artist like Joe Bonamassa who is certainly at a creative peak and has music and ideas flying off his fingers should capture as much of this as possible before he's too darned tired or burned out!!!

You can view each individual show to see if there is a song or set list that has more appeal to you. Personally I am in the mood for rock sometimes, blues with horns other times, trio work others, so I'll return to these depending and I'm glad I have all 4.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1383091200,42,2718,4.284600389863548

8610428,5,B00EYRWUQW,"I'm a new fan, and I saw parts of this 4 day event on cable, and started collecting his work.

His work is great, by any standard, but the shows he does in London are well beyond that!

Joe is built for performing, and just like Jimi Hendrix, the studio work is just 'laying the base line'.

It's all about the shows!

I would be cliche if I said that this package is his best work. I have not seen all of his shows!

What I will say is that when you combine his creativity with his live energy you get a true SHOW!

I would still encourage you to get his works on CD. He produces very tasteful work!

But this experience he gave us in London is ......... just one 'event' a true Connoisseur of musical performances could not pass up!",1392422400,4,734,4.090909090909091
8610429,5,B00EYRWUQW,"This boxed set completes my collection of all his recordings (at least so far -- the guy is so darn prolific!)  I love the concept of this, 4 concerts, in venues ranging from a small 250 seat club, to a massive concert hall!  He changes up the personnel, the song list, and the mood from venue to venue.  Great job!

The packaging is unique - the box looks like a Marshall amplifier!  Cute idea.  Many of my friends have been turned on to JB by me.  I hope you'll become a fan, too!

8610430,5,B00EYRWUQW,this is the best bonamassa I have ever heard fantastic. everybody should own one. I can't think of a better dvd than that,1389484800,,121,4.304347826086956
8610431,5,B00EYRWUQW,"Actually for $399 you can go to Joe's web site and buy this same box set and get two premium tickets with a meet and greet to a concert of your choice anywhere in the world with no expiration date. I did the Joe concert with a meet and greet a while back and we had 3rd row seats. Well worth the money.

The DVD set is awesome, excellent video and audio quality. Joe Bonamassa is unbelievable and the rest of the musicians playing with him are on the top of the list. When I first saw this set come out I thought, I have 2 of his concert DVDs already and I don't need more, but I was wrong. Its not the same old same old, its freshened up and kicking. You will not be disappointed.",1388620800,4,681,3.9708029197080292
