8498236,5,B006H99HR0,"Here's a chance to have 10 of Ray's politically themed music videos in one collection...to enjoy on your television sets. Some people who are without internet for whatever reason or those who just want to have an officially released collection of Ray's on-line music videos will be thrilled with this. The DVD collects 10 music videos but they are compiled in random, not chronological, order. The on-line boom in the career of Ray Stevens began in December 2009 with the release of the music video ""We The People"". The video became an instant viral hit and the song deals with opposition to ObamaCare, the nick-name given to Obama's Utopian-influenced health care scheme that was passed by his party, which at the time controlled both houses of Congress, and it was signed into law in 2010.

After the smashing success of that music video (more than 4,000,000 You Tube views at last glance!) Ray Stevens found himself on top of the Tea Party heap and from 2010 onward he's released several comical music videos via You Tube with a conservative/Tea Party point of view. In the summer of 2010 Ray was all over the illegal immigration debate as his music video, ""Come to the U.S.A."", spoke to millions of frustrated citizens who were annoyed with the concept of Amnesty and the fishy practice of turning a blind eye to those who come to the country illegally. The video's received more than 5,000,000 You Tube views to date!

A 2010 CD titled WE THE PEOPLE arrived soon after...as did a serious release on a song called ""God Save Arizona"". In 2011 Stevens issued SPIRIT OF '76 and several more politically themed music videos...with ""Obama Budget Plan"" obtaining more than 1,000,000 You Tube views a couple of weeks ago. His current music video, ""Mr. President - Mr. President"", is video #5 on this collection. A track list is below.

So, now, for those who hadn't been paying attention (more than a few people thought Ray retired years ago...some think he died!) but for those people and for those who don't frequent social network and video hosting sites that much, Internet Video Hits will introduce you to Ray's music video contributions over the last several years.
