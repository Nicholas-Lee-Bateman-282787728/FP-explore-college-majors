481880,5,6302587239,"This tale stars the infamous gentleman-theif Lupin, along with Jigen the expert marksman, and Goemon the samurai of the old school. With Lupin and Jigen heading for Cagliostro (Europe's smallest country) they become  involved in an adventure including preventing a fixed marriage, a Princess  and an evil Count. This being one of my favorite movies, and Miyazaki being  my god, I cannot recommend this movie enough. Highly original, Cagliostro's  action sequences will leave you breathless while the emotion brought forth  from the highly addictive story will draw you in and leave you lingering in  a world that is simply too beatiful to want to leave. From the fist scene  where Lupin and Jigen rob the Monte Carlo, and while escaping leap over  several bicycle racks and sub-humanly glide 12 feet with perfect ease while  a comical springing sound is made, this instantly becomes a classic. Thank  God for Manga for re-releasing this film treasure.",955929600,31,951,5.116883116883117

My only gripe is with Eastern Star media not being more clear that later on they would release a blu-ray version and I'd have to buy it all over again. You really have to follow them and do your research before buying their products. This also happened to me with the  ""Lupin the 3rd: Jigen's Gravestone"" release they did recently. Kinda starting to become a problem with them.",1465171200,6,508,4.3936170212765955
481998,5,6302587239,"Awesome movie of the early day Lupin, it was a great story, it had interesting characters, also lots and lots of action plus it kept me entertained as the movie went on. This Lupin , in a way has the personality of that of the first James Bond actor Sean Connery, I say because He was more like a Gentleman in this one. When the Red Jacket series started, Lupin became more funnier and goofier, like the Roger Moore Bond with his jokes every now and then.  But I also know that there is too a serious and darker Lupin which I never seen of yet, I guess the Blue Jacket series is that type if I'm not mistaken. Anyway,If anybody is a fan of Lupin the 3rd buy this movie. 5 stars",1460246400,,677,4.090225563909774

482063,5,6302587239,"Like many fans here, I've often lamented the lack of a truly ""definitive"" release of Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro in the US. Previous releases have been, in many ways, cut, edited, adapted, punched-up and generally tampered with, resulting in ""incomplete"" releases (the only time we ever got the opening title sequence unaltered previously was in Manga's 2000 DVD, and even then, it had blurry, letterboxed video image). I'm an advocate of films being released in their original, unaltered forms, and for it to take a whole 35 years for Cagliostro to get this treatment is simply ridiculous. Hayao Miyazaki and Lupin both deserve better.

With all that said, fans can rest assured, as Discotek (in cooperation with many other people in the know) have crafted a beautiful, unaltered and ""definitive"" release of The Castle of Cagliostro. Unlike previous releases (such as Manga's, which I believe used some DVNR techniques), the video is presented with lush colors, stabilized image and fantastic color correction. Unlike in previous releases, you can now clearly see the film grain, meaning no loss in quality resulting in crushed blacks or line erasure. The film is now also presented in full anamorphic widescreen, without the annoying ""overscan border"" that plagued Manga's 2006 Special Edition.

The audio and subtitle options are where the real cream of the crop is, though. For audio, you have the default Japanese, the 1992 Streamline dub, the 2000 Manga dub, an edited version of the 2000 Manga dub removing profanity (think of those TV edits of movies like Blazing Saddles and Pulp Fiction and you have an idea of the audio editing), and an excellent and thoroughly entertaining commentary by Reed Nelson of LupintheThird.com. In subtitles, you have a new translation of the original Japanese by Shoko Oono (Evangelion 1.11/2.22, Metropolis, The Place Promised in Our Early Days), a transcript of the 1992 dub, songs and signs tracks for the 1992 and 2000 dubs, and for the first time on home video, a full restoration of the 1980 theatrical subtitles used in film festivals and private screenings in America throughout the early 80s, the same print viewed by legendary animator John Lasseter. This is my personal favorite feature on the DVD, as it's a great piece of film history.

The remaining extras are small, but sweet. They are translation notes by Reed Nelson and Shoko Oono and the opening and ending credits for all previous home video releases in the United States.

If previous releases have left you burned, you have yet to own this movie, or if you're a Miyazaki fanatic who wants to see where the legend began, then this DVD is an absolute must. It's a damn near perfect release of a damn near perfect film.",1423267200,4,2743,4.969498910675381
482064,5,6302587239,"It's been a long time coming, but the ultimate release of a classic film is finally here! I've owned the old Manga release, and the horrific ""Special Edition"" that butchered the opening credits. When I saw that the a new release was out I immediately purchased it, hoping that AT LAST I would have the release that this film has always deserved. I was not disappointed.

First of all, you are probably wondering if the picture quality has finally been cleaned up to make this film look the way it always should have, and the answer is a resounding yes! It appears that like so many American DVD releases of anime coming out, this one was pulled off of an HD Japanese master probably used for the Japanese blu ray. No more yellowed, speckled, cruddy, dirty picture. Everything is bright and colorful and crisp. Simply gorgeous! But the REAL surprise for me was in the audio options.

I know that voice!

I was a fairly big fan of the old Manga release (but not the additional swearing), and the Japanese dub is a classic despite it's mono sound. So when I saw there was yet another English dub I was thinking it would probably be yet another sub-standard dub like the mediocre Disney dub from Castle in the Sky. I was shocked and amazed when what I found was more akin to the classic English dub of Giant Robo!

Like Giant Robo, the original English dub is VERY loose with the translation and is nowhere near the subtitles. And like that classic dub, it is incredibly over-the-top. And yes, like that dub, I absolutely love it to pieces! I did detect a voice or two from Giant Robo, and I'm pretty sure Trigun is in there as well as some other classic 90's voices (Solid Snake from Metal Gear Solid is Lupin!!!!). Everyone does an absolutely fantastic job in their role. In particular I loved the ridiculous fake European accent from the guard who now sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger! It's silly, over-the-top and at time laugh-out-loud cheesy, and all the more awesome for it. In addition...

The Effect of Sound

Anime in general is not known for having fantastic sound effects, and the sound in the original Japanese dub of this anime is quite subdued. But the new dub features surround sound effects that are incredibly immersive and superbly balanced. You hear birds chirping, thunderous waterways, and suitably punchy sound effects in fights and chases. All of this makes the movie immensely more theatrical than it was before. Likewise, while the original Japanese dialog is classic, the new Americanized dub is on-par with the very very best of dubs that rewrote the dialog to create something new. I'm reminded again of Giant Robo, but also of Martian Successor Nadesico and Bubble Gum Crisis Tokyo 2040.

There's more!

There's also a commentary, a reversible case, and other extras. Purists will buy this release for the improved picture alone. But if anyone wants my two cents, I'll say you absolutely MUST hear the new dub if you haven't before. Yes, the original Japanese is a classic, and so is the old dub. But this dub, amazing as it may sound, is ANOTHER classic. It's nothing like the old dubs with their quieter, less immersive effects, but it IS absolutely fantastic and recommended both to fans with an open mind, and people who don't normally like anime and have never seen this film before.

If you love great films, buy this release. It's definitive.",1423094400,11,3376,4.698815566835871
482095,5,6302587239,"At last! Ive been waiting for a re-release of this film since I discovered Hayao Miyazaki films a couple of years ago. I was finally able to view it for the first time last night, and it is definitely worth a purchase. Miyazakis first film is definitely not his worst. True, it has its cheesy moments but thats all part of the ride! Its a hilarious movie about a thief who decides to break into a guarded castle to rescue a captive princess. Sounds a bit odd if you're used to Miyazakis other films, but its pretty obvious that it is a Miyazaki film once you start watching it. The humorous action sequences put me in mind of Castle in the Sky, and the animation is actually better than that of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Miyazakis second film.

As for the DVD itself, it is the best North American release of an anime film Ive ever heard of. It includes the Japanese Audio (with new, accurate subtitles and old, inaccurate ones) as well as both English dubs! It even includes a family-friendly version of the newer dub, which cuts the swearing down to a minimum. While the newer dub is closer to the original Japanese translation, the acting is subpar. I found the older dub to be so much more natural to listen to. However, it does take quite a few liberties and frankly it gets a little over-the-top with cheesiness. I guess you have to decide whether you want better acting or a better translation when you're watching it in English. This DVD also includes subtitles for songs and signs for when you are viewing it in English, which is really convenient.",1422662400,4,1567,4.479020979020979

482098,5,6302587239,"This is not only one of the greatest animated films of all time, it's one of the greatest films, period. I've owned this film several times over now between the tapes and older dvd releases, and this is the highest quality version yet... until the blue ray comes in a few months.  There's been countless essays about what a masterwork the film is, and how great Hayao Miyazaki is, so I'll not repeat them.

Its nice to have both dubs and the japanese track in one place, and several subtitle options, I also like the restoration of the original theatrical subtitles, awful as they are, its rather charming..  Picture quality is great, and the packaging is nice too, I particularly like the rings being the disk image.

If you don't already own the movie, this is the definitive version to get... unless you have a blu ray player, in which case, wait another couple months.  There's been no official announced date for the blu release yet, but it's coming!",1421193600,3,955,4.627218934911243
482099,5,6302587239,"**Update(5/18/15): Blu-ray packaging photos added, some details updated.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: I was actively involved in the development of this DVD/BD. BUT I was not paid to write this review, and this listing really needs an informative review, and my love for the movie is very real! The feature film itself is easily worth five stars, in any case.

ABOUT THE MOVIE: This is the second Lupin the Third anime film, and the first anime feature directed by Hayao Miyazaki, originally released in Japan mid-December 1979. It's a wonderful film filled with action and adventure, some mystery, and even a hint of romance. The story is one of master thief Lupin and his partner-in-crime making off with wads of cash in their latest heist, all of which, they are surprised to learn, are counterfeit. Lupin heads for the source of these fabled, near-perfect ""Gothic bills"": the tiny, picture-perfect European principality Cagliostro. There, Lupin meets a young lady, Clarisse, under duress to marry the wicked Count Cagliostro. With an elaborate plan and the help of his friends, Lupin infiltrates the trap-filled Cagliostro Castle to rescue the damsel, and maybe even take a little something home for himself in the process.

THE VIDEO: First off, the DVD easily has a better picture quality than any preceding US release. It features full, anamorphic widescreen with no overscan border. The colors are no longer washed out but instead reflect those found in high-definition releases. The opening credits, which were butchered into a still-frame sequence in the previous ""Special Edition"" release, are now completely uncensored. There are no overlays or any alterations to the source video here.
(*NEW*) The Blu-ray is basically a major step up from the DVD. The picture is cleaner and bolder, and the audio is improved. Personally, I prefer the colors on the DVD version over the Blu-ray version, but I also spent hours upon hours looking at and re-watching this movie. While I kind of prefer some things about how the DVD looks, the Blu-ray also looks great in motion.

THE AUDIO: Most notable about this DVD and BD is that there are multiple English audio and subtitling options. If you want Spanish or French audio or subtitles, you will have to revisit the Manga Special Edition. However, found on this release are:
- The Streamline Pictures dub from 1992, featuring Bob Bergen as Lupin, a.k.a. ""the Wolf"" (monaural)
- The Manga Entertainment/Animaze... Inc. dub from 2000, featuring David Hayter as Lupin the Third (5.1 stereo on DVD) *This track was completely restored and remixed for the DVD from the original master by the original mixer, Les E. Claypool III. So it's a lossless 2.0 track on the Blu-ray. The DVD's 5.1 is actually nowhere near as good and admittedly kind of a fakey surround mix. :(
- An optional, edited-down, ""family-friendly"" version of the Manga Entertainment dub, with only a few mild curse words remaining. This was newly created to bring the dub more in line with the tone of both the original Japanese script and Disney's Studio Ghibli releases, which can (mostly) be enjoyed with the whole family. The movie itself remains uncut even when viewed this way. This audio track is 2.0 stereo. The Blu-ray version of this is revised and improved from the DVD version, using the newer sound elements from the remastered, uncut version..
- Original 1979 Japanese audio (Monaural). The Blu-ray has an additional 5.1 surround track in Japanese as well.
- Audio commentary by me, some dork who likes the movie. Listen only if inclined. (Mono.)

THE SUBTITLES: There are also multiple subtitle tracks available:
- Brand-new translation of the Japanese (complete with translation notes in the menu)
- Recreation of the ca. 1980 theatrical English subtitles, as screened in indie theaters and conventions nationwide during the 1980s and onward.
- The Streamline Pictures dub script (on the DVD version only)
- Signs- and Songs-only subtitles for both English dubs (these are condensed into one single track on the Blu-ray).
- Subtitles for the Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing (based on the literal script translation; found on the Blu-ray version only)

THE SPECIAL FEATURES: Regarding the DVD, you can find both of the original theatrical trailers in full widescreen glory, and a collection of the various openings and endings from previous home video releases. Special features missing from this release that were on the Manga Entertainment Special Edition include the Yasuo Ohtsuka interview, storyboards viewing mode, and a brief image gallery. While I personally think the improvements in picture and audio options here easily outweigh the few missing features, please refer to the disclaimer above. :)

(*Update*) A few additional BD-only special features made the cut:
- More alternate versions of the opening credits sequence
- Storyboard viewing mode (with ""baked-in"" picture-in-picture)
- Interviews with Yasuo Ohtsuka (animation director), Kazuhide Tomonaga (key animator), and Monkey Punch (creator/author of the Lupin III comics). These are new to the English-speaking market; they previously came out on a French Blu-ray set years ago.
- Lengthy interviews with voice artists David Hayter (Lupin voice, 2000 dub) and Bob Bergen (Lupin voice, 1992 dub).
- Film introduction by David Hayter
- Slideshow art gallery with character/mechanical models, promotional art/posters, and Miyazaki's original imageboards/concept art.
- These are on the DVD also, but the two versions of the original theatrical trailer are now presented in HD on the Blu-ray.

(*Updated*) ABOUT THE PACKAGING: The DVD comes in a clear keepcase with a cardboard slipcover, but I swapped my keepcase out for a different one. I felt the stock one was a bit ""soft"", but your mileage may vary. My replacement is harder to fit back into the slipcover. The stock one I believe has a different locking mechanism. As you can see, there is a cardboard slipcover on this DVD that looks completely different from any other release of the film. The artwork sheet itself is reversible, and the inside art matches the slipcover (the outside art looks like the cover here on Amazon, except the final product is simply the ""Collector's Edition,"" not the ""35th Anniversary Edition""). The disc itself looks like the Count's red/golden goat ring.
The Blu-ray is very similarly packaged, but the disc features Clarisse's blue ring emblem (reversed from the DVD of course), and the inside cover sleeve is a poster spread instead of a duplicate of the cardboard slipcover art.",1420502400,215,6547,5.146616541353383

482148,5,6302587239,"This movie, which introduced me to Lupin III, is the main reason why I got interested in anime back in the '80s.  Sumptuous animation, an exceptionally well-executed story, and wonderful characters, with plenty of action, tension, and humour all make for an irresistible film.  I cannot recommend it enough.  What a pity that copyright issues have prevented it from remaining accessible to the English-speaking audience.

As for this particular edition, the transfer is very nice, but the liberties taken when the beautiful opening credits were replaced by screen-captured images with super-imposed English credits border on the offensive and do not do this movie justice.  The credits were originally presented that way for a reason.  Up until this movie, all opening credits sequences for Lupin III anime were filled with action and accompanied by a dynamic soundtrack, be it from the first or second TV series or the first theatrical feature (""...Cagliostro"" is the second).  The opening credits for ""Castle of Cagliostro"" are meant to prepare you for watching something that is a step away from all the Lupin III anime that has come before.  Altering that does a disservice to the film, the audience, and certainly to the director, who obviously had a reason for choosing to present the credits sequence the way he did.  Shame on Manga Entertainment.

Since dubbed anime doesn't agree with me, I'll not comment on the quality of it, but I will say that the sub-titling is very nice and while I will quibble with the wording in a few spots, it is, on the whole, accurate and easy to read.",1400803200,,1591,4.947368421052632

Obviously, when they produced this edition they intended it for play on an old CRT TV--4x5 aspect ratio. But now that most of us have widescreen LCDs and plasmas, guess what? Miyazaki's widescreen images come with black bars on all four sides. It's doesn't fill up your widescreen the way it should. So, there's your caveat. Still a very fun movie. P.S.

And Castle of CAgliostro is one of the best you will find, even if it breaks some of the canon around the main character Lupin III.  However, for those who don't know of the manga by Monkey Punch that first introduced Lupin to Japanese audiences, this movie can still be the foundation of an enjoyable afternoon.

The story itself has a foundation in its own simplicity.  Career thief Lupin III happens to see a girl in bridal dress trying ot drive away from some thugs, and spontaneously decides to rescue her.  That decision soon has him investigating an evil count, a counterfieting ring and a legend of a family treasure hidding for four hundred years in a little independent Grand Duchy somewhere in Europe.

My favorite characters are Lupin the 3rd, the princess of Cagliostro, and Lupin's partner with the black outfit. These 3 characters were astounding including some of the other characters like Lupin's female buddy/rival, the villainous Count and his stealth servants, and the Police Inspector.

Lupin realizes that he needs help to take on the Count of Cagliostro so he uses his charm to obtain help in achieving his objectives of finding out what is going on inside the castle and safely going through his adventures.

482404,4,6302587239,"The Castle of Cagliostro is the second animated film for the Lupin III franchise, and is also the first feature film directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  When watching this film, you can see that it has Miyazaki's touch to it, especially when it comes to the animation.  However, there is a difference in the tone between The Castle of Cagliostro and Miyazaki's later films.  This film does have a bit more humor than most of Miyazaki's other films; however, there is also a little bit of blood shown and there are piles of skeletons depicted in one section of the film.  It's an enjoyable film, but it's not meant for very young viewers.  Personally, I would recommend The Castle of Cagliostro for anime viewers who are twelve or thirteen years of age and older.

When it comes to special features on the DVD, there isn't a whole lot to speak of.  The ""Manga 2000 Fanclub Trailer"" runs for four minutes, and it's a slideshow of the products Manga Entertainment had available at the time this DVD was released.  The ""Manga 2000 Trailer"" runs for four minutes, and it's made up of video clips of some of the properties available, which is set to music by the band KMFDM.  The ""DVD Catalog"" is a menu where the viewer can choose what they want to look at; the links take the viewer to single page entries for the titles (in addition to anime, this menu includes some live action properties and properties that are not Japanese in origin).  The final feature is ""Weblinks,"" which is a page that provides web addresses for Manga Entertainment and Sputnik 7.

Even with the lack of special features, I would still recommend this DVD of The Castle of Caglisotro to anyone who is a fan of either the Lupin III franchise or of Hayao Miyazaki.

Although this was the third film of anime's favorite thief(the second one to be animated)it is considered to be the best feature ever of him, mostly due to the fact it was directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

Lupin and his partner Jigen begin pulling off a daring casino heist, but realize all the bills they stole are counterfiet. So they decide to go to the source of the funny money, an un-named small European country run by the devious Count Cagliostro. When they arrive, Lupin rescues a teenage girl from some hoods, although she goes with them in order to keep him safe. Lupin learn that she is the Princess Clarisse who is betrothed to the Count, although he's only doing it to find an ancient buried royal treasure. So, Lupin plans to get her from the Count's castle, by calling in Goemon, and then sneaking into the castle disguised as Zenigata who's arrived with his own Interpol squad. Once there, Lupin is sent down into the castle's dungeon, along eventually with Zenigata, although they both escape, but Lupin ends up getting shot. Thinking that Lupin is dead, Cagliostro goes on with his wedding, but Lupin & Co.(along with Fujiko)crash the party. Lupin and Cagliostro have a swashbuckling duel, which leads to the reveal that the lost treasure which is actually a sunken Roman city. Lupin then heads for the hills with the Zenigata Force in hot pursuit.

Cagliostro has been viewed by many as a true anime icon. This was in fact Miyazaki's very first animated movie that he worked on prior to him forming Studio Ghibli. It has exceptionally detailed animation, plus some wonderfully original action sequences, such as elaborate fight in the clocktower, and the best non-Speed Racer car chase of the 70s. There have been two releases of this movie in America. The first was in the 90s on dubbed VHS by Streamline Pictures, and the other was on DVD a few years ago from Manga Entertainment. I'd personally say that the Streamline dub had better casting and dialogue, but the Manga version has a Japanese track and better quality.

My biggest gripe about this ""Special Edition"" is the butchering of the opening and end titles and lack of any special features.  Watching this DVD the first time then seeing this type of crummy translations are disheartening. Anime to this day should not have this type of Voltron-edit butchering anymore.  So now the opening titles are no longer animated and are restricted to still images with English credits.  Really an insult to the original anime Hayao Miyazaki's vision of giving a bit of narration even during the credits.

Same goes to the end sequence in which it no longer closes with ""The End"" and a long shot of the surrounding city.  Now it has an extended credit roll sequence in an empty void with the only saving thing is the use of the extended song.  A ""special feature"" would have suffice of having the original unaltered openings and closings, but alas none.

The baddies are superbad - they are the Monaco-like royal family of the tiny European kingdom of Cagliostro - and somehow Lupin outwits them all. Of course, he also marches into danger and allows himself to get beaten up. But, like Mifune Toshiro in Yojimbo, he outsmarts the bad guy, who eventually gets his just desserts in a very oddball way, and gets away with millions in loot. Of course, while Goemon and Jiggen are barely in the film, and some of the brushes with death are really just too close to be believed (hey, I know it's an animated film but there's no reason to out-deathdefy Indiana Jones), it's still a pretty good film. This time I watched the dubbed-into-English version, and the voice of Lupin was done by my old high school classmate David Hayter, who calls himself Sean Barker - the character he played in his only feature film, the Guyver 2 - and who also does the voice of Solid Snake in the North American version of the Metal Gear games.

The Castle of Cagliostro is in the words of Spielberg one of the best action movies of all time. It's catchy, it's intriguing and and it's visually perfect.
In the 1970s Hayao Miyazaki directed the first series of TV episodes of Luoin III and also directed a series called 'Conan -the future boy'--based on Alexander Key's novel ""the incredible tide'. Those who have seen Hayao Miyazaki' Conan will not fail to recognize that the characters in the Castle of Cagliostro are visually very similar to those in the Conan series.
With the exception of spirited away, Castle of Cagliostro is probably Hayao Miyazaki's best movie. As in all the most recent movies by Hayao Miyazaki, the movie makes full use of the four elements; water,air, fire and earth. Unlike the most recent movies by Miyazaki, Castle of Cagliostro is not pervaded by the magical realism that characterizes spirited away, porco rosso and so on. there is very little magic in the castle of cagliostro. but the movie is permeated by the kindness which pervades all Miyazaki's movies (and which is th reason why some hard core Lupin III fans were not so happy with this movie).

It was.

Frankly, I don't go to movies anymore--unless perhaps they are by Pixar or receive rave word of mouth.  Somehow the folks who make movies these days have by and large decided that the public are a bunch of idiots willing to fork over upwards of twenty bucks to take a date or friend to see their work.

Miyazaki's movies, especially Cagliostro, are worthwhile precisely because they respect the viewer.  Cagliostro tells a great story with well-drawn characters and perfect plot development.  Perhaps the cartoony aspect of the film gets one to lower expectations, but I doubt that.  It is, very simply, a caper film; a thief who is going to outwit another thief and then steal the girl.

482624,4,6302587239,"But his best sets so very high a standard that not even he can always rise to it. This one left me with very mixed impressions, so let's start with the good in the mix.

The story is well above ordinary, for animated movies. Lupin, a thief, spends most of his time one border-crossing ahead of the law. This time, meets the beautiful but mysterious young woman under bumbling circumstances, and they end up in Castle Cagliostro. It turns that she's a princess, held against her will, and that there's a deeper secret in the castle's recesses ...

It's an exciting, kid-safe bit of fluff. A few things didn't work very well for me, though. There were just a few characters too many, so some didn't get the development they needed to become real personalities. More annoying, the movie generally stayed close to the anime standard look: lipless, willowy-thin, and long-legged, with wild rubbery facial expressions. Each time I'd start to take the plot a little bit seriously, one of the animators would fall back into goofiness better suited to saturday morning `toons than a feature film.

Since Miyazaki was involved, there are some great, painterly backgrounds and exotic aircraft. The latter included an autogyro, familiar to James Bond fans, and a fleet of Israeli Aravas or something with similar configuration. On the whole, this one's for the Miyazaki completist, or for anyone who wants animated adventure with chaste romance and minimal bloodshed.

482625,4,6302587239,"This cult Animation film in 1981 is the debut work for Hayao Miyazaki as a movie director.

During 70s Miyazaki often collaborated with Isao Takabata in masterpiece anime works such as Heidi--the Girl In the Alps(1974), one-year weekly run TV animation film based on Johanna Spyri's well known children's story. After collaborating with Takabata's TV animation series of Anne of The Green Gables until the midstage, he became independent from Takabata and went on his own. First one he did was the Lupin The Third series film sure-to-be-hit anime series in Japan.

This work I feel is not in concert with other Lupin III works though Miyazaki took up earlier Lupin III episodes around 1973. And some anime fans might find the influence from FUTURE BOY CONAN(1979) HEIDI(1974), and even Paul Grimault's mastepiece animation film ""Le Roi et l'oiseau(The King and the Mockingbird)"" . Basic settings are as Miyazaki himself acknowledges came from ""Le Roi et L'oiseau"" And some of the beautiful landscape of Italian sides of European Alps reminds me of Heidi. Also Lupin's superhuman mobility reminds me of Conan, the Future Boy.

As a fan of Lupin III series I found Lupin a bit too good-natured, and surprised at Lupin's archirival Zenigata a bit too cool. If you are Miyazaki fans you may find this work interesting as you can see how his directing method evolved if you know his pre-Ghibli works so much.

Verdict: Enjoyable but not as organized as his later works
Rating: 88 out of 100

482628,5,6302587239,"Please don't let reports of swearing deter you from purchasing this  animated classic. I would also like to point out the swearing was for the most part added in by the distributer, Manga. The original Japanese track has only one or two bad words. However, the additional swearing in the English track may not be suitable for small children. The violence is for the most part cartooney, although the use of guns and grenades are used frequently in the film. There is one scene where blood is present, but none of it is gratuitous, and is more for dramatic effect.

The film itself is the very first theatrical direction of the legendary, Hayao Miyazaki. IMHO it is up there with Sprited Away and My Neighbor Totoro. The animation is gorgeous for beign a 27 year-old film and makes it look as if it were made in 1985! You can also see elements of Miyazaki's storytelling: Brave heroines, flying sequences and character development.

A little insight on the main character of this film. Lupin III is one of Japan's most-loved characters. He was originally created by Katou Kazuhiko, better known to the world under the pen-name, Monkey Punch. In the original manga Lupin is more of a dark horse, but an equally entertaining character. In Castle of Cagliostro, he is portrayed more kindly and sentimental. This is because Miyazaki wished to represent Lupin an the twilight of his career where he's looking for fulfillment that he cannot find in thievery. It hints he may even be bemused by his past. This also probably the closest Lupin III gets to being like his grandfather (Arsene Lupin) of the Maurice Leblanc novels. Lastly, this is probably one of the finest performance of the late Yasuo Yamada, who voiced Lupin from 1971 - 1995 (he passed away on March 17, 1995 due to cerebral hemorrhage). To his Japanese fans, Yamada was the spirit of Lupin III.",1157068800,5,1854,4.751552795031056

What you'll find is a lot of old style animation, lots of action, lots of humor, lots of low brow stuff. In fact, I think Spielberg said this was his favorite cartoon. Lupin III is in fact well known in Japan a decade or so ago, at least 300 1/2 TV shows, and 5-10 movies. You won't understand everything in this movie unless you know something about Lupin III.

482714,5,6302587239,"I'm a Miyazaki fan.  I've seen a good deal of his work and loved it, so I don't know why I waited so long to see Lupin the 3rd: The Castle of Cagliostro.  I guess I was afraid that since this anime came out in 1979, the animation would be disappointing.  I needn't have worried.  While the animation is limited to the technology of the day, the quality that is so much a trademark of Miyazaki dazzles even here.

The story is a page in the life of the lovable rogue, Lupin the 3rd.  A man with the gadgets and mystery of James Bond, the charm and skill of the Man in Black (from the Princess Bride) and the constitution of an iron kettle.  In this yarn, Lupin is off to a small country in Europe to discover the source of counterfeit currency.  In short order he encounters a runaway bride, a whole gang of well-equipped thugs, an evil Count and his old nemesis, Inspector Zenigata.  Nothing could be better for Lupin and his buddies Jigen-a gruff, gun-toting side-kick--and Goeman-a samurai with a passionate wish to see action and a chance to use his sword.  Action, gunplay and hilarity ensue in this action-packed story.  While Miyazaki makes use of almost every clich in the book in this story, he manages to utilize them in such a way that the entire story feels fresh.

This may have been one of Miyazaki's first movies, but fans will quickly see that his mastery exists even here.  The movie is, of course, dated with the illustration of clothing and cars capturing the 1970s surprisingly well.  And the animation doesn't have the depth and breadth of the modern masterpieces like SPIRITED AWAY or PRINCESS MONONOKE.  Yet, all the touches are there in Lupin that make it more than just a fun adventure with average animation:  scenes of the clouds moving over fields, delightful movement that evokes Miyazaki's love of the dizzying heights and gear run machines.  Fans of the later movies will see all prototypes of scenes and characters that the director will make use of in future movies.

I will admit that folks who fell in love with the more youthful SPIRITED AWAY, CASTLE IN THE SKY, and KIKI's DELIVERY SERVICE, may be less than enthused by the purely adult cast in this movie.  There's a good deal of gunplay and some adult language involved-this is not the movie for younger children, and is more appropriate for the older child and teenager.  Despite the violence and language, there is no gore, no adult scenes or sexual situations.  And, did I mention the movie is a romp of the first order?  Loads of fun, laughs and non-stop action make this a perfect movie for a teenager's introduction to what animation can offer beyond little kid cuteness.

I highly recommend this to any anime fan that has yet to view it.  And to anyone looking to explore the world of anime movies, this isn't a bad place to start.  For those who enjoy this and would like to explore more excellent anime, check out the rest of Miyazaki's films and you might also check out COWBOY BEBOP the series.

Castle of Cagliostro has more of a prototype feeling. The animation is less detailed, and more common in style. The characters are always in action, and don't stop and have the heartfelt moments that some of the later films have.

482718,4,6302587239,"I don't know who that guy is, but he's emphatically not Lupin III. Lupin is a sexist, arrogant jerk, and the hero of this film is eminently likeable -- a gentleman thief with a quirky sense of humor, honorable despite himself and a terrific reluctant hero. He's an action hero who's more interested in showing the villains up than in killing them.

Lupin has just committed a daring heist of cash when he discovers the money he's stolen is counterfeit -- they're the legendary ""goat bills,"" near-perfect forgeries created to devalue the world's coinage. Tracing the money to its source, he finds his way to Cagliostro, a fairy-tale kingdom full of beautiful women, hidden treasure and deadly perils.

Like most Miyazaki films, Castle of Cagliostro feels like it was aimed at adults while remaining suitable for children. There aren't any terrifying moments like in Spirited Away, just a fun spy romp. Young kids may need the concept of counterfeiting explained to them, though.

This film is, however, very similar to Laputa: Castle in the Sky, though with fewer fantastic elements and a simpler ending. Overall, I'll admit that Laputa has better visuals, but Castle has more interesting characters and holds up better on later viewings.",1117756800,3,1237,5.024390243902439

482721,5,6302587239,"There is probably no anime character as revered or as celebrated as Lupin the 3rd (well maybe Captain Herlock). Lupin's adventures are truely some of the most entertaining in the entire medium. And The Castle of Cagliostro continues that tradition in spectacular fashion.

Directed by the legendary Hiyato Miyazaki who directed Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, The Castle of Cagliostro follows Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko, and Goemon to the European country side. There they find that the Duke of Cagliostro is about to wed a young lady, who has ties to Lupin's past.

This is, without a doubt, an absolute joy to watch. At a time when so many anime series are overly tedious, brooding and melodratic, it's refreshing to see a film that has a grand sense of adventure and being humours at the same time. Lupin the 3rd may be the world's greatest thief, but in this film he gets to play the hero. Which is a great change of pace for Lupin. One of the great things is that even if you're unfamiliar with Lupin the 3rd, you'll have no problem following this film. This is almost a ""stand alone"" movie.

The transfer is excellent. The color is very clean even for an older film. The original audio track is presented in 2 Channel Dolby stereo as is the English track. One of the things I couldn't get used to was that the English voice actors are different than that of the current voice talent on the Lupin the 3rd series currently airing on Adult Swim and released by Pioneer. But if you listen to the original Japanse dialog that's not a problem.

The DVD has a very good menu layout. There are animated scene selection menus, which I found very nice considering that most older DVD's don't feature them. One of the things is that the ""Extras"" are a little sparse. There's some background on Miyazaki, trailers and really that's about it.

This movie is wall to wall fun. With so much anime being so deadly serious, it's great to sit back and have a good laugh.

But Bond with a big difference: ironically, this movie is LESS cartooonish than the real Bond movies! Bond has lots of gadgets that are incredibly specialized yet just happen to come in handy EVERY TIME, villains who are usually just too loony to be believed, and he has babes who want to jump in the sack with him after eyeballing him for 30 seconds. As a teenage boy fantasy movie, Bond rules; but if you want to see a fun, rollicking adventure/spy movie, then Castle of Cagliostro is actually a better bet.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this is one of the earliest movies by a Japanese director named Miyazaki. Most Americans have never heard of him, but in Japan he's looked upon like Spielburg and Lucas rolled into one person. Many people have compared him to Disney, but I think that's not a good comparison. While Disney worked in the same medium, his films were much more child-oriented, and for better or worse, he established many of the animation formulas and cliches that have become the norm for American animation (with notable exceptions like the superb Iron Giant). Disney has become synonymous with dumbed-down and formulaic. No one would EVER use those terms to describe Miyazaki.

While it is really Miyazaki's later work, such as the incomparable Spirited Away, that earned him his reputation as a genius, this film is still very much worth seeing. In fact, what I generally tell anyone who will listen is that you can't go wrong treating Miyazaki's name as a sort of brand name: just rent or buy anything made by him and you're guaranteed to see a movie that is well made, thoughtfully written, a visual feast, and most of all, wonderfully original. How many directors can you think of that fit that description?

The main character of this movie, Lupin, is from a long-running series. But I haven't seen any of the other episodes, and I assure you that you don't have to see any of the series beforehand to be able to enjoy this movie: it stands on its own.

In closing, let me mention that there is a persistent myth perpetuated on various Internet sites that Steven Spielburg called this one of the greatest adventure movies ever made. As far as I can tell, he never said that. Still, this wonderful movie doesn't need any made-up endorsements. See it, and you'll see why.",1092528000,45,2565,4.665929203539823

Lupin and sidekick rob a casino and during the ensuing pursuit happen upon a princess chased by thugs.  Ultimately leading back to a castle, a count, and a small country holding secrets to counterfeiting and beyond this was an excellent early anime with a great plot.  It's interesting to see the character and stylistic cues later anime, particularly Cowboy Bebop, took from the Lupin saga.

482776,4,6302587239,"Castle of Cagliostro is Miyazaki's first feature and stars the characters of the Lupin series. Miyazaki worked on much of the first season of Lupin and did two episodes in the second including the finale. I haven't been able to determine if these episodes are avaible on any in-print English release. While the animation is considerably cruder then Miyazaki's later works, the film is filled with thrilling adventure and fun humor. The breakneck pace and knock out action set pieces make up for the cruder animation style. Even without any prior knowledge of the Lupin characters, the story is simple to follow. Only the appearances of the female spy and the samurai seemed odd to an unititated viewer.
Film: 4 stars out of 5.

It is not Miyazaki's best, but it is easy to see his style emerging. The character designs for the count and the bride would soon appear in Nausicaa as Kurotawa and Nausicaa. Castle of Cagliostro is a great adventure film, but lacks the emotional realism and epic narratives that make up his later films. It may be Miyazaki's best on a pure entertainment factor. Think of it as a James Bond film by way of Pink Panther with Jackie Chan.
Manga's dvd is less then stellar. Picture quality is dicey. Most of the time the picture is fine with good color, but there are problems that pop up. Black spots appear on the film from time to time and several times heavy black blobs show up on the frame. The print also suffers for instances when the images shudders and appears to shake a bit when there isn't movement in the frame. These problems do detract, but generally they didn't distract from my viewing.
The video is presented in letterboxed format with subs that are half on the frame, half on black. I avoided the dub because the Japanese audio was just fine. Purists might be annoyed to find that the end credits are typed in English over a black screen without music, I don't know what the orginial Japanese print had. There aren't any extras other then several lame Manga Video ads.
Castle of Cagliostro is not part of the Disney/Ghibli deal so don't plan on them for releasing a new dvd. I would still recommend this dvd, although hopefully someone in the future will release it without the minor picture problems. Pioneer and Funimation both have recently put out other Lupin dvds, but I don't know of plans to pick up this title.

482778,4,6302587239,"If you're coming to CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO after having admired Miyazaki's other work, you'll be extremely disappointed - it's his first feature as a director, and is clearly a work-for-hire based on Monkey Punch's popular (and VERY Seventies) LUPIN III manga and anime. So there's very little of Miyazaki's humanism or love of nature here - and a lot of Lupin III's outlandish sideburns and 007-Meets-Benny Hill schemes.
However, if you're coming to this movie looking for Lupin III, you'll be delighted because it's an outstanding adventure for him and his usual gang of cohorts (including Inspector Zenigata - who has to work WITH him for a change to catch a genuinely dastardly villain!). If any touches of Miyazaki are evident, it's in the movie's treatment of women and sex - the heroine Clarisse seems tremulous at first glance but proves to have a lot of courage in the clinch, and for once Fujiko is more effective female hero than doublecrossing tease. Even Lupin's perpetual horniness is toned down considerably - he comes off as a genuinely gallant ""gentleman thief"" than the loud jacket-wearing stunned-ox-in-heat he often comes across as in the anime series (currently playing on Cartoon Network's ADULT SWIM block).
Another good touch is the portrayal of Zenigata - ""Pops"" isn't a totally-incompetent bullying buffoon in Miyazaki's view, but a good cop driven bonkers by his fruitless pursuit of a great adversary. He knowingly risks his career (and life) and teams up with the man he's been determined to arrest since - well, forever! - to stop the villainous Count Cagliostro's schemes. Of course, the movie ends just as almost every Lupin III adventure does, with Zenigata chasing Lupin - again! - and Lupin, Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko getting away from him with foolish ease...again....
If you go into CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO looking for a fun lighthearted adventure, you'll be delighted - just don't expect to see much of the man who would later give the world classics like TOTORO, PRINCESS MONONOKE or SPIRITED AWAY.",1058054400,18,2031,5.029673590504451

Compared to the DVD for Japanese market, the contrast of picture is too strong, and sometimes dark colors turned to simple black.  Reel change sign and dust on the film bothered me.  I also noticed in a scene, the picture swayed horizontally, with poor focus.  The frequency range of sound is narrower than Japanese version.

Its goofy, silly, fun where hints of Inspector Cleuseaus, James Bond, Our Man Flint come through in the main character Lupin the thief.
There are unexpected scenes in this movie portraying them as chain-smokers, eating ramen noodles with chopsticks while staking out a castle, and a Samurai sidekick that shows up in traditional garb smack dab in a make-believe European country!  Truly hilarious.",1053388800,2,549,5.2272727272727275
482782,5,6302587239,"Hayao Miyazaki has been called the Akira Kurosawa of Animation, and the Disney of Japan. Neither term is sufficient to describe his genius. Among his many fans, there is much debate as to which of his movies is the greatest. Some people say Castle in the Sky. Some say Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And many feel that this film is his best. Hard to say, but I would definteily say it's one of the best movies ever made, to say nothing of one of the best animated films ever.
Lupin the Third is big series in Japan. You might say he has a following like that of James Bond in the United States. But that would be a serious understatement. There is Lupin Manga, Lupin OAVs, Lupin movies, Lupin games, a Lupin TV show. And that's just what I've heard of. But despite the fact that Lupin is a huge phenomenon spanning a huge variety of media, everyone seems to agree that the crowning achievement as far as Lupin goes is the castle of Cagliostro. And the best part is, you don't have to know anything about Lupin to enjoy it!
The animation is old, more than 20 years. But like all of Miyazaki's animation, it looks better than much of what passes for animated films today. The backgrounds and mechanical devices in his films in particular are always amazing. The film transfer on this DVD isn't exactly the greatest. At times, it shows scratches and metal flecks on the print. At one or two points in the film it looks a little dim and washed out. But in the good parts, the use of color and detail is truly awesome.
The characters in this film are great. Lupin himself comes across like a combination of Jim Carey and James Bond (in the best possible way), and his many sidekicks (from his heavy firepower loving right hand man to the serious samurai and sometime love interest Fujiko) all are just great. The villain is pretty evil, making the great escape and showdown at the end of the movie that much better. But the real stars of the show are Lupin and the beautiful young girl he has sworn to rescue. Both of them are just PERFECT.
This film also features great action sequences (the great car chase, a gyrocopter getaway, and steel-clawed assasins come to mind). And let's not forget about the music. From the opening credits to the ending of the film, the score does not disappoint. Speaking of sound, the Japanese dub features the same perfect voice acting you will find in every Japanese version of a Miyazaki film. And this dvd features a great English dub too. People with young children should take note, though. The English dub has more harsh language than the Subtited version. I'd say about the difference between a PG and a PG-13 rating).
What makes this movie for me is it's wonderful sense of BALANCE, something Miyazaki has mastered absolutely. There is adventure. There is action. There is comedy. But most of all there is the infectious idealism and beauty of the human spirit that makes all of Miyazaki's films absolute classics. Everyone should see this movie. Any animation fan should buy it.",1052438400,10,3020,4.553308823529412
482853,5,6302587239,"Made in 1979, but you won't be disappointed.
Lupin the 3rd was a very popular T.V. series during 1970s and 80s. Lupin is a master thief, grand son of French ""Ar sene Lupin."" He has very characteristic companies:
Jigen: a master gunman who can shot anything he wants.
Goemon: a samurai, who can cut any object with his sword.
Fujiko: Lupin's enemy and lover.
Zenigata: a inspector from Tokyo police who has been pursuing Lupin, but never succeed.
""Castle of Cagliostro,"" was made in 1979 by a famous director Hayao Minazaki, and this  was his first movie.
I've watched this movie in Japan when I was a little kid, and I never forgot about it. I recently purchased DVD and watched in English dubbed. The translation is little different from the original, but I think they did pretty good job. I can tell they tried to make it easier language.
The most exciting thing in this movie is Lupin's character: a thief who is skillful, gentle, kind, and having sense of humor. Lupin was manage to steal princes' heart in the story, but had to leave her at the end. It was Lupin's dandyism which takes your breath away.
Scenario is also well written. There are some intelligence conversations with political background. Lupin was pursuing the secret of counterfeit in a small nation, Duchy of Cagliostro, and run into a princess who was forced to be a bride against her will.
This movie, there are some similarity to ""Shrek."": To rescue a princess locked in a tower, unmanned camera pictured Lupin when he tried to get into the castle, and Lupin breaking into princes' wedding ceremony and said ""I object!.""
This is still enjoyable to those who are not familiar to the T.V. series. Animation looks old compare to today's one. But I don't think you will be disappointed. One of my friends who never knew Lupin, watched this movie, and  said ""You can call me Lupin, if you want.""

The charm of Lupin III and the absolutely wonderful pacing/flow of the action catch your attention from the first moment. It doesn't take itself to seriously but by the end every character has a place in your heart (especially Lupin III). In my veiw the animation style is perfect for the light theme and the backgrounds have excellent detale, especially in the castle.
As a warning, I would warn parents away from the other Lupin III movies, as they have not been touched by Miyazaki magic (and turned to gold;) There is a little swearing and cigeret smoking in this one as well... but the pure fun within makes it perfect for anyone over 6.

I'm a huge fan of the Lupin III series.  I'll be the first to admit that the series itself isn't that good and that many of the TV movies aren't that good either.  However, the two episodes and the movie which Myazaki directed are hands down some of the best things I have ever seen.
With that out of the way, no, this isn't Myazaki's best work.  For every other film he does, the characters are his.  He creates his characters specifically to fit a role.  However with Lupin III, he had to use characters that were already established in the hearts and minds of thousands of viewers.  It's amazing how Myazaki manages to take these characters and make them all shine and yet stay true to their original motivations.  There's never a point where the viewer thinks, ""Now that's not something I think Lupin would do.""  This is something that many of the other directors of the Lupin movies could not achieve.
I have seen the Lupin series with a wide range of voice actors, including the Japanese.  The cast of this dubbed version of Castle of Cagliostro is the best of the group.  They really know how to make the characters shine.  The Japanese cast is frightening and unemotional at best, but the English cast of this version certainly makes up for the shortcomings of the Japanese one.
Like many of Myazaki's works, and certainly with all of the Lupin III series, you have to bring your imagination along for the ride.  Everything will happen, even if you're not quite ready for it.  There's car chases, princesses in tall towers, a counterfeiting scheme, instant noodles, and an exploding archbishop.  The Castle of Cagliostro is a wonderfully light-hearted film, and the absolute best of the Lupin III series.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1043712000,,1898,4.671686746987952

The movie reminded me of the old Peter Sellers movie ""The Pink Panter Strikes Again"" with a touch of James Bond. The setting is similar and there's a lot of the same kind of gags. Not that this has to be a bad thing, but it does give the movie a slightly dusty 70's odor. The same goes for the animation in selected scenes. For example, the movie's damsel in distress, Fujiko, is drawn in a ""cute anime girl"" style that looks a bit dated today.
On the positive side, the movie *is* a lot of fun, and well worth watching. Not to mention that the story appeals to all ages and is fairly safe for family viewing(no nudity, violence limited to slapstick comedy). A lot of the animation is really good as well, just don't expect overall visual quality like Princess Mononoke or other more recent works.",1041292800,2,830,4.431372549019608

So keep this in mind that this movie is not made for children, though children will most likely enjoy it and probably the language is no worse than some of the stuff that appears on cable television.
Having said that, I will tell you this is a terrific film and Lupin is a wonderful character - sort of a screwball comedy in the best sense, with James Bond thrown in for good measure. And this movie lends itself well to rewatching it - and I have.
Many other reviewers here have gone into the technical details much better than I'm capable of doing, so for that info please check their reviews.

482912,5,6302587239,"Acclaimed Anime genius Hayao Miyazaki scored his first box office hit with this charming, fast-paced, enjoyable tale about a clever thief coming to rescue--you guessed it--a princess from a dastardly monarch who wants to marry the lass for his own purposes.  He's accompanied by a loyal gunman and a solemn but cunning ninja and pursued by a Japanese police detective who actually helps him at one point of the story.  Along the way, there are a bunch of other obstacles to overcome, including bad guys with armored claws, the mazelike corridors of the Cagliostro castle itself, and a counterfeiting scheme.  The animation is obviously dated, since the film is over 20 years old, but there are elements of Miyazaki's characters in his later films to be found in the designs of the protagonists and antagonists--the big, round eyes, wide-opened mouths when laughing and/or shouting, and of course, their everchanging facial expressions.  The jazz-rock underscore by Yuji Ohno lacks the richness of Joe Hisaishi's scores for Miyazaki's films after this one, but it suits the tone of the film perfectly.  Although not as beautiful, meaningful, or powerful as Miyazaki's later films, CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO is a joy to watch, with plenty of action-packed sequences, humor a-plenty, and enough fun to keep one enchanted.  (Wait until you see the tools that the hero posesses!)
 The DVD version features a respectably good transfer presented in its 1.85:1 aspect ratio, even if it does show its signs of age, such as occasional film scratches and/or smudges.  However, this is probably best to be expected since the film is over 20 years old.  The Japanese language track is presented in mono, and sometimes sounds as though it was transferred through, say, a telephone.  (A characteristic of the recording techniques of the early years, no doubt.)  The English language track, on the other hand, is presented in clear stereo with a full, rich sound.  One wonders how they were able to clean up the soundtrack for this dub -- it sounds like it could have been made recently.
 I only spotchecked the Japanese language track, but the acting is decent, from what I heard. The film was originally dubbed in English by Carl Mecak of Streamline Pictures.  I have not seen this dub, but I heard it received mixed opinions; it has its fans while others detested it.  However, I DID enjoy this ""new"" dub created by Manga Entertainment, which follows the script closely, despite some questionable inclusions of profanity in the dialogue (""We're rich bastards!"").  The voice cast is well chosen and sound like they are having a great time hamming it up.
 On the downside, the DVD contains no special features other than trailers for MANGA releases, rather lame menu selections, second-rate packaging, and not enough chapter selections for advancing.  A film this wonderful deserves a better treatment.  A ""Making-Of"" documentary, please?
 Don't let the drawbacks hold you back, though, CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO is ***** material, as can be expected from the master of Japanese animation.  I recommend it very highly.",1031443200,10,3093,5.061143984220907

A few years later, I purchased this movie on VHS when it was released in the US.  So when I saw the DVD was out, I took a chance and purchased it.
Having watched the VHS version so many times, I was immediately struck at some translation differences (in English).  While the story was the same, there were parts that were very differently translated so that certain parts were almost like a different movie.  I was annoyed until I did some checking (and watched the original Japanses version which is also on this DVD).  As a result, I've come to the conclusion that the DVD contains a much better translation than the VHS version.
If you like your DVD's to have tons of extras, you may be dissappointed with the lack of goodies in this one.  However, if you are a fan of Lupin III, this is a must-have DVD.

Like all of Miyazaki's other works, this film has gorgeous animation that compliments a very intricate and heartful story.
Fans of the original Lupin III comic by Monkey Punch may not appreciate it as much since the characters act a little 'nicer' than the fans may prefer, but Miyazaki's talent lies in weaving a good story together with beautiful animation, and it is clearly evidenced here.
This film stands not just as a good example of whats good about Japanese animation, but as a good movie in general... Interesting characters, clever plot twists, amazing action, and a good dose of heart. I still stand surprised that some hollywood shmuck hasn't bought the rights to it and mangled it into the lame ""blockbuster"" live-action formula that America is currently plagued with. But I digress...
I can think of no  better introduction to anime than Hayao Miyazaki. Castle of Cagliostro is definitely one of his better works, and you will find yourself amazed at how 'real' this hand-drawn animation feels compared to the generic pocket-monster-giant-robot-half-naked-girls-with-guns-otaku-fanboy-teenager-boobshow stuff... in fact I'd say that's the only thing this film is missing. :) ... again, I digress...
This work is a cut above and deserves a higher respect, as it's done by a man who clearly has more respect for the art.",1005436800,130,1977,5.1397515527950315

action/adventure film should have: a fearless hero
with faithful sidekicks and slick gadgets, an evil
villain, a damsel in distress, a castle, plenty of
humor, daring escapes and chases and of course,
music from the 70's. This is probably because it was
made during the 70's ;-).
Seriously speaking, Lupin is a successful merger
between James Bond and Indiana Jones, with a
personality and sense of timing which surpass
both. The movie is a lot of fun to watch. Jigens
(his partner in crime) is also a great character.
This movie is a lot of fun. Everything is stereotyped
(Lupin is the typical charming rogue which gets away
with all his thefts). I don't think you'd regret
watching it and even buying it (if you collect anime).
On the technical side, the animation shows its
age (both in detail, frame rate and quality of
picture). The soundtrack is good; however, in my
copy the Japanese track is simply _horrible_
(technically speaking; the voicing is wonderful).
I don't know if it's because of my system (an old

In other words, the new dub was a big pile of monkey doo!  I will be getting the movie on DVD for the sake of getting it on DVD, however for a couple of years now I've been honored to own the Streamline Pictures dub of ""The Castle of Cagliostro!""
I don't know what happened to Streamline, but my gusse is that they went out of bussness (Who knows?)!  But even though they're gone, they're excellent dub stays with us (Or at least, whoever had bought the tape before it was discontinued)!  The dub for Cagliostro is one fine dub!  All the charicters voices are top-notch, well casted, suiting, and they are great actors too (Much like the english cast of Tenchi Muyo!)!
The cover for this movie is very good (Much better then MANGA's cover), and the quality of the film excellent to boot!  The story is also well-paced!  It has enough comedy, action, drama, ann more chase sceans in 100 minutes then I remember in any of the 007 movies!

Although directed by Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Nausica), his direction took too much out of the Lupin III characters. Cagliostro keeps the zany action of Lupin III, but it has little of the 'Lupin' charm compared to the other Lupin III movies and TV shows. Overall, this is still a good movie, but is more of a 'bangaihen' or side story type of anime. Overall, this is a good buy and it features an enjoyable story.

This movie has a cute, fairy-tale plot which neither repulses nor excites. A lot of action. It might be fun to see this film remade in live action. A lot of fantastic Indiana-Jones type of chases and escapes. The dubbing is adequate, but certainly far from the top-notch job Disney did on Kiki's Delivery Service, for example. Miyazaki's films are always beautiful to look at. Oh, I did find the music a little on the schmaltzy/cheesy side.
It is fun to watch once or twice, but I honestly can't see what anyone would find to strongly love or strongly hate about this product. The greatest animated movie ever? Nah. Just a sweet, watchable, passable Miyazaki effort that doesn't take itself too seriously (which Princess Mononoke possibly does do).
If this sort of thing is your cup of tea, don't be deterred by the nit-pickers who only gave it one star. If you are hoping to be blown away, you'll probably be disappointed.

Unfortunately this new DVD release is a severe let-down. Cheap workmanship, zero features, a lousy cover, and to make things even worse, they've redubbed it - and the new dub is crap. I can understand how someone who's never seen the better version of this film might see this new dub and find it worthwhile - after all, the original film which this redub is based on is of such high quality, that it's hard to totally water it down. But to anyone who's owned one of the original version videos, and who like myself considers this one of the all-time greats, there's no comparrisson.
Unlike some of the previous reviewers who've been incensed at the lackluster quality of this release, I won't be automatically returning it. The original japanese version is here, and so are the cleaned and restored letterbox visuals. But I won't be listening to the english dub again, and I'm severely let down and embarrassed for the company responsible for putting this product out. I wouldn't want my company's name on this shiny, plastic tragedy.
I only hope that if they ever decide to provide a more features-packed release, worthy of the title, that they have the understanding to provide the 79' dub as one of the audio selections.

This film has everything that one could possibly want: humor, action, mystery, and even a little romance for all you love birds. If you have little kids I suggest that you preview this film. While it is not violent in nature, there is mild profanity. (Probably nothing that they haven't already heard, but it wouldn't hurt to take an active role in your child's life. This movie would probably get a PG.) If you're looking for a DVD to put your VHS to shame then this isn't exactly it. There are `cigarette burns' in the print, and while they aren't too annoying this should not happen on DVD. There is also some `graininess', but it doesn't detract too much from the movie.

So those of you with expensive audio systems will miss out. The film is presented in letterbox or wide screen, so nothing is left out.

I've watched both, and I must say that I was greatly impressed with the English voice acting. This is good for all of you who hate reading your movies.

483085,5,6302587239,"The second big screen outing of Lupin III is already one of the best Anime movies ever made, while rivalling anything Disney or Pixar has to offer. Green ogres, fat superheroes or a zillion gigabytes of computer animation still cannot compare to 12 frames of hand drawn charm.

For the uninitiated, Lupin III is the grandson of Arsene Lupin, the gentleman thief, created by Maurice Leblanc in the Twenties. He's always breaking into some impenetrable vault, or has a zillion gadgets up his sleeve to help with escaping if things go awry. He's also rather wacky and buffoonish, which makes his antics a joy to watch.

Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle), in his movie debut, tones down the out of control wackiness of the Lupin III TV show and gives Lupin a rather decent plot to dig his teeth into. This is not an excuse to string together a bunch of insane set pieces.

Seconds after robbing a Monte Carlo casino, Lupin and Jigen discover that every dollar note they have swiped is a fake. Only one place in the world is known to make these counterfeits and Lupin's underworld knowledge leads them to the tiny European country of Cagliostro (think Luxemburg, only much, much smaller).

Half a moment after crossing the border, Lupin and Jigen are involved in a car chase and rescue the Lady Clarisse from a bunch of goons. But she's promptly kidnapped again, though manages to leave Lupin a clue in the form of a strange wedding ring.

Their suspicions over the kidnapping lead them to the titular castle where they discover that an evil Count has seized control of the country, using - guess what? - funny money. And the ring is the key to a great treasure that can only be uncovered when the Lady Clarisse is married to the Count.

Lupin deliberately blows his cover to Inspector Zenigata (the perpetually stressed Interpol officer who is always chasing him) as a diversion, while he breaks into the castle to rescue Clarisse. What follows is scene after scene of hairs breadth escapes and impossible scenarios.

Miyazaki's attention to detail is what truly elevates this beyond typical animation quality. There are enough moments of quietness and atmosphere to balance out the loud scenes. A strong sense of setting also comes from the imaginative ""photography"". Too many animated movies disorientate the audience with frenetic direction and over-indulgence, but Castle Of Cagliostro works so much better by taking its time and choosing the best angles to cover the action. His trademark flying machines and overeating scenes make their first big screen appearance here.

Far from his typical sub-genre of eco-friendly animation, Miyazaki is obviously a big fan of Lupin and has made a movie that refuses to be missed. Even Spielberg called CoC ""one of the best adventure movies ever."" Any fan of Miyazaki should check out this film immediately.",980640000,2,2866,4.9070247933884295

The story is by one of the manga most innovating authors Monkey Punch. That may be a little bit disappointing for some who expect to see a  ""characteristic"" Miyazaki film. Some may say the story is a bit  more traditional but it is a perfect action comedy nevertheless. Granted,  it is far more lightweight than most of the Muyazaki's later works, still  you see the hand of the master everywhere in this movie. Miyazaki was one  of the original creators of the Lupin TV series in the early 70's and even  though he did not create the characters from the scratch, there is a lot of  Miyazaki in the way the characters are animated. On the backside of being  lightweight, this movie is has a lot of laugh-out-loud humor, the story is  captivating and the action is superb. The main characters: a chivalrous  thief Arsene Lupin the 3rd ""the Wolf"", his sharp-shooting  chain-smoking associate Jigen, a cool samurai Goemon, sexy and dangerous  Fujiko -- all are extremely likeable bunch. If you are craving for more,  try to find the two TV episodes also directed by Miyazaki (""Aloha  Lupin"" - series finale - and ""Albatross: the Wings of  Death""), these were released in the US and are available from some  videostores. There are at least 5 more Lupin the 3rd feature films (some  refer to ""Rupan"" in their English titles, that's how the Japanese  pronounce ""Lupin""). None of these is directed by Miyazaki. The  two that i saw were quite entertaining, not really Miyazaki level, but good  if nothing else as a chance to meet the great characters again.

His humor,  cleverness, abilities, and wise choice of loyal friends (Jigen, the  sharpshooter; Goemon, the swordsman; Fujiko, the femme fatale; and  Zenigata, the inspector), make him overcome enemies and obstacles that  would make Bond and Batman pause.  It's too bad that, while popular in  Japan, Lupin never had much of an exposure stateside, like Pokemon and  Sailor Moon.  Hopefully, the re-release of ""Castle of Cagliostro""  would change all that.

483145,5,6302587239,"Fans of Miyazaki are no doubt quite familiar with the old dub of this 1979 classic, and until now this was the only way Castle of Cagliostro could be seen.  Although the dub had a certain amount of charm, it was a long ways  from being faithful to the original, making significiant changes to Lupin  and Goemon's character--clearly a less than ideal film from one of the  world's greatest animators.  Fortunately April marks a date that Miyazaki  and anime fans can rejoice with this outstanding DVD from Manga video.  As  should be expected, sound and image are excellent--something that is  especially impressive for such an old animated film, although close viewing  will reveal the occasional imperfection in the original.  Also, Manga has  included a new dub that is far closer to the original language (often being  nearly verbatim) but lacking some of the charm that the original dub  posessed, and also suffering from what to my ears sounds like a less than  spirited reading.  I will level one more gripe at the dub and that being  the homogeneity of the voices--several voices sound to me as though they  are read by the same person, and while I don't know if this is true or not,  the voice actor for Zenigata in the original English dub feels sorely  missed.  Fortunately the subtitled version outshines any of the dubs (both  past and present) so this still remains the best way to see Castle of  Cagliosto on all counts (sound, image, accuracy.)
But enough of the  technical aspects--CoC remains one of the classics of anime and a film that  can be watched dozens of times.  The characters are unforgettable and the  story heartwarming.  While the animation might look a bit old by todays  standards, it is personalized, warm and inviting.  Like everything by  Miyazaki, there is nothing here which will offend and makes perfect  entertainment for all age groups.  While this is definitely a very early  work by the master, it is the first of his films to make it to our shores  on DVD, and should be purchased without hesitation.",957139200,4,2044,4.775862068965517

7827697,5,6302587239,"It's without a single doubt in my mind or with the slightest hint of irony or exaggeration when I say that this film is one of the greatest ever made in my opinion and one that has taken a staggeringly short time to produce. Look into this if you're interested, but a film of this scale and beauty made under a year is enough of an accomplishment in it's own right to warrant the 5 star rating altogether. Miyazaki's first and definitely my favorite film is a masterpiece in every which way, and while it may not be in the spirit these characters are traditionally in, this being a lot more heroic and light hearted, it's definitely an extraordinary interesting take on them by the man who helped forge his first series. I can't recommend this film enough, please do try to see it, it's worth every penny.",1501113600,,805,4.445945945945946

7827701,4,6302587239,"Bottom Line First: Not my favorite Miyazaki movie, but The Castle of Cagliotro is everything that makes even a lessor Miyazaki movie worth watching and owning. Recommendation: Miyazaki movies are very easy to recommend. The Castle has way more going for it than my review may express. The Castle is a keeper for me and should be a welcome addition for you.

In terms of the artistry the characters are not the best drawn figures Studio Ghibli has produced. I suspect that because the Lupin 3rd series was a magna and something of a Saturday Morning cartoon. The result is that the figures are cartoon like. Pay attention to the always beautiful landscapes and clouds and you know what Ghibli can accomplish. The Castle can get ghoulish and violent and there is a family friendly English version. Maybe not for the very young, but overall a family movie nitgh selection.

The plot has honors the traditions of the heroic criminal while providing some nicely unexpected variations. What I begin to notice is that Miyazaki movies tend to be slow even stately. In this case the overall urgency of saving the princess can get dulled in the business of presenting the various characters, and the dead spaces between plot events.

A particular detail that bugged me involved what was supposed to be a major fight sequence where in Lupin takes on hordes of baddies. Why alone? He has at least two confederates who had been waiting for the boss to take action, they provided no support nor is there any explanation for their disappearance from the story.

Still the overall story has some clever details. Characters are mostly what you expect. A plot summary absent spoilers would read like a thousand other stories including a nod to Sleeping Beauty and It Takes A Thief.  There is the standard grumpy side kick; the noble Samurai, non-too smart but honest police; the embodiment of evil bad guy and some wicked evil loyal and scary hoards. (Think Minions, but seriously dangerous). And so forth. The bad guy castle clichs are present, as are the good guy gimmicks. What matters is that the movie never feels clich. The masters hand is revealed in evoking the classic and the expected but making the story hisown. For all the standard stuff leading into the resolution, I did Not See That coming!",1489968000,,2288,4.7969543147208125
