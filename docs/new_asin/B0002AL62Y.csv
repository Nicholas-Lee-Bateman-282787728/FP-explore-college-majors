8025237,5,B0002AL62Y,"Absolutely superb!

Smartly written, excellent source material, great interviews and charming color home movies (showing a still spry Chaplin in the 1960s playing around for the camera).

This is, by far, the best Chaplin documentary ever produced, and one of the best documentaries of ANY kind that I have ever seen.

You will not be disappointed.",1206144000,11,348,5.178571428571429
8025238,5,B0002AL62Y,"This would be a great introduction to Charlie Chaplin.  I decided to start wiht the Robert Downey Jr. film, ""Chaplin.""  That was a bad move on my part.  This came in a box set called ""the chaplin collection.""  It is a great film narrated by Sydney Pollack.  Great interviews with family members, friends, and footage from the most famous Chaplin films.  Buy this, you will not regret it.",1182556800,9,387,4.617647058823529
