7794130,5,0970110170,The instructor's thorough and well-timed instruction guides you through a series of asanas and kriyas that highlight the benefits that each style of yoga can provide. I agree entirely with everything the previous reviwer said including the desire for Susan to do another more advanced tape. This tape is somewhere between beginner and intermediate. There are variations on some postures that I have not experienced elsewhere. This is also a fine introduction to some aspects of Kundalini yoga for someone who has never tried that practice.,1063324800,,539,5.27906976744186
