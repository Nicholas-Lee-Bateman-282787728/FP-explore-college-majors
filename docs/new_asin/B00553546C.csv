8457332,5,B00553546C,"Now settled into it's stride, Rescue Special Ops returned to screens in Australia in late June 2010 and the thirteen episodes contained on this discset gained an average audience of just under a million viewers each week. One fantastic addition to the cast was Luke Pegler who joined the team as Bingo. The energy that he seems to bring to the show really helps it reach it's maximum potential.
With the rest of the cast remaining from the first series, what makes this series so special is the amount of outdoor scenes involved. Comparing this with drama on the same channel Nine Network over 30 years ago such as The Young Doctors really shows what can be achieved today.
The following series would sadly be the last, but I'll give series 1 and 2 10/10 so far.",1351728000,,762,4.569343065693431
