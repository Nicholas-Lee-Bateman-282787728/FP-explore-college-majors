8519901,4,B007OWUZTI,this is a great film well directed and well made I really truly enjoyed it!,1422230400,,75,4.066666666666666
8519902,2,B007OWUZTI,"After 20 minutes, just removed from my list.  What a waste of talent,  The lighting was poor - too dark to see any details and could barely recognize faces; the camera work was fair; the dialogue - it would have made a better silent film.  The acting was passable - direction must have been poor.  Having some experience as a past member of an international ritual magick organization, the rituals and summonings wouldn't have called forth anything except a neighbor banging on the wall - there was no confidence or power in the chants at all.  I had been looking forward to seeing Orson Welles and Pamela Franklin working in the same movie - the casting was just so...unusual.  It was worth it to see someone supposed to be Welles wearing a really child-friendly fake goat head mask, I suppose.",1420416000,,795,4.642857142857143
8519903,1,B007OWUZTI,"The problem here (the only one, but it's a big one) is that (as I suspected, but wasn't certain of) this is NOT the original film shown in theaters under the title ""Necromancy"". For release on video (VHS) in the early '80s, radical changes were made for a version that was sold under the title ""The Witching"". Scenes were cut (including a vital, final twist), re-arranged, or switched around, the opening & closing credits were totally redone in a very run-of-the-mill style, the original musical score (including a memorably ominous song) was entirely replaced with a terribly cheesy one, the whole look of the film (especially towards the finale) was altered & not for the better & there was even new footage shot, woven into the plot. The artwork seen here advertising the film is the original movie poster with a few important exceptions. Originally, the background was white, not red, the little devil-doll figure in the middle wasn't used &, of course, there was no ""a.k.a. The Witching"". Instead, an asterisk led to a definition of the word ""Necromancy""--*A Life For A Life"". The original cut is nearly impossible to find anymore, in any format. If Amazon wants to look into adding it to their buying options (& if they can afford the time & money involved), looking in European countries might be a good idea, since the last remaining copies of many presumed-lost films have been found there, because it was often the end of the distribution line.",1403740800,7,1455,4.824
8519904,1,B007OWUZTI,"This movie is so bad on so many levels it's hard to know just where to start. The basic plot is a young couple move to an isolated eerie small town where there are no children; they're forbidden by the man (Orson Welles) who owns the town and everything in it. The lighting, directing, and editing are all terrible.  The audio was also quite muffled, and most of the acting was stilted.  Even the great Welles seemed like he was just going through the motions in a lackluster performance.  What was he thinking when he agreed to do this picture? I actually remember seeing this flick on TV when I was 11 or 12, and thought it'd be a good addition to my library today.  Never trust a review from a pre-teen!  There are actually two versions of this film; ""The Witching"", and ""Necromancy.""  The DVD I purchased was boxed as ""Necromancy"", but the very end copyright statement indicated that it was actually ""The Witching"" with previously released footage from ""Necromancy."" As there was quite a bit of nudity, including frontal nudity in the opening scene (parents please take note), it must have been Necromancy that aired on TV all those years ago.  The climactic scene at the end is pretty scary, but that's the only good point; the rest of the film is cheesey, bordering on the painful to watch.  If you see this one at Half Price Books someday, you'll know where my copy ended up.",1367193600,3,1382,4.544354838709677
8519905,5,B007OWUZTI,"This 1972 ""horror"" flick is a must for anyone who loves B-Horror and Orson Welles! It's in 3D, as well, so add this to your collection for next Halloween! It makes a great double feature with Bette Davis in ""The Dark Secret of Harvest Home""!",1363564800,2,241,4.377777777777778
8519906,5,B007OWUZTI,Why don't someone release this movie without 3D and in a format which will play on my regular dvd play. Oh rats!!! And that means NTSC either all region or region 1.,1348617600,3,165,4.1875
