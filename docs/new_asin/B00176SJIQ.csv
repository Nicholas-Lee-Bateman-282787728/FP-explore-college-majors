8265156,5,B00176SJIQ,"Thanks to Amazon I am able to get the Agatha Christie dvd's staring David Suschet as Hercule Poirot.  After the Funeral kept you guessing as do who had done it?  As usual the acting and suspense was great.  The authentic look of the beautiful scenery, cars, homes and the over all look was outstanding.  I always go to Amazon to purchase the BBC series of other various dvd's.",1370563200,,376,4.485294117647059
8265157,5,B00176SJIQ,"David Suchet - who is now officially the only true Hercule Poirot - is at it again, sorting out the Knot Gordian constructed by Agatha, despite being on a holiday in the country. Seems that a newly-interred old rogue has died in his opulent manor, and After The Funeral a queroulous spinster sister spills the beans - the old man was murdered, she says, throwing the cat amongst the pigeons of the family, each lusting after the spoils.

There is some good character acting, by familiar as well as unknown faces, and of course the settings, photography and dialogue are first rate.

Only the keenest of Christie's fans will suss out the inevitable solution produced by Herculke's ""Little Grey Cells,"" but the journey to the inevitable revelatory gathering is a great romp. This isn't Wuthering Heights, but it beats most of the fare thrown at you by TV and the increasingly irrelevant film industry, more interested in pulling in the popcorn crowd and co-branded merchandise than thoughtful films that bear a second - much less a third - viewing.

If this isn't in your collection, it's a must - but it's even better value for money if you buy the set.",1302307200,,1152,4.721393034825871
