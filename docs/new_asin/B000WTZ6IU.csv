2991807,5,B000WTZ6IU,"Our whole family loves Maggie and the Ferocious Beast.  Slow paced, kind, all about the love of pretend play, which is where my 3-year old is at these days.  The only problem is she doesn't want to watch anything else anymore, so looks like I have to buy some more Maggie DVD's as the repetition is getting to the older members of our family.",1222646400,2,342,4.328125
2991808,5,B000WTZ6IU,"It took my daughter and I a couple weeks to understand what my 2 year old granddaughter continually requested.  She implored us to get or turn on the roast beef show ... turns out she meant Ferocious Beast ... We have tried to collect all of them.  Now the 7 year old and 2 year are arguing over which one to watch first.  They love them.  The beast is gentle, Maggie is cute, the stories have lessons; a good, fun time with a lovely story each time.  I highly recommend especially if you have child or grandchild afraid of monsters or unseen scary things.  Lilli has been terrified about monsters.  Now she says they're not really scary. She knows they're like Maggie and the ""roast beef"" and she's not frightened anymore.  : )",1214870400,3,728,4.421052631578948

They watch them over  and over again! Even request them in the car DVDs player. Hamilton Hock makes them giggle to themselves. Wholesome entertainment teaching them great values! Highly recommended !",1432166400,,370,4.873015873015873

They have been enjoying these movies for over a year now.",1412812800,,171,4.0588235294117645

8225566,5,B000WTZ6IU,"I may be 20 years old, but I still love Maggie and the Ferocious Beast today. I really enjoy watching this DVD. It's has a couple my favorite episodes. I used to watch this series on Nick Jr. and it's reruns on Noggin. Until last year it has been cut off. ""Rain Showers and Spring Flowers"" is my only Maggie and the Ferocious Beast DVD that I have in my collection. I hope to get the other 4 soon. I believe they contain all of the episodes.",1318982400,,441,4.080459770114943
8225567,5,B000WTZ6IU,my 3 yr. old loves this DVD. My son loved it when he was 3yr. almost 10yrs ago. I could not find it anywhere in stores.,1313712000,,119,3.6153846153846154
8225568,5,B000WTZ6IU,"Peculiar but cute, Maggie and her friends, Beast and Hamilton hang out in
Nowhereland and meet other intriguing characters; like a bunch of living jelly beans
and a giant hen. Contains articulate conversations to develop children's verbal and social skills.
Good for 2-4 years old. The characters personalities gives it some spunk.
The very polite Maggie, uptight Hamilton and childish Beast makes for an interesting group.
