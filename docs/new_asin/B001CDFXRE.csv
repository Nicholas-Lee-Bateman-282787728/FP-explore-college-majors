8286929,5,B001CDFXRE,"Love this workout!  And love the instructor, Joy (not the woman pictured on the cover!).  The flow is easy, but the workout is thorough and I feel strong and relaxed at the end.  Bite-sized segments are great for those days I'm short on time, or just too tired to do more. Definitely would recommend.",1465257600,,300,4.518518518518518

8286932,5,B001CDFXRE,"I love this workout so much that I re-ordered it when I lost my yoga DVDs on a recent trip. It's broken into 3 ten-minute workouts, so it's an easy way to get in a good workout even if you're short on time. I often wake up and do the first ten minute segment just to get my blood flowing. It's challenging and also easy to follow. The first time I did this workout it was hard, so I always know I've been lax in my yoga practice if these are hard to get through. Great addition to workout DVD collection.",1269561600,4,504,4.0
