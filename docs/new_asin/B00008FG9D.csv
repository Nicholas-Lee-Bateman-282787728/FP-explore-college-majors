7982417,5,B00008FG9D,"I love Air Supply. These guys are so far out. Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell just bleed talent. They play their biggest hits of this time in their career. ""Even the Nights are Better"" is absolutely flawless. I'm a 14 year old guy, and I love Air Supply. I know alot of people don't like the whole love song thing. But these guys are so talented. ""All Out of Love"", ""The One that You Love"", ""Lost in Love"", ""Every Woman in the World"",and other hits like ""Now and Forever"" are present on this amazing display of vocal ability. ""Here I Am (just when I thought I was over you"" is absoultey amazing. All you fellow airheads out there, there are some pretty rare performances. ""I Can't Get Excited"", ""Don't Turn Me Away"", and ""I've Got Your Love"", and a really rocking version of ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""This Heart Belongs to Me"". Anybody who appreciates talent and good music will love this video.",1117152000,7,894,4.5246913580246915
