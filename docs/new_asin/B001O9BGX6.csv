8329987,4,B001O9BGX6,You can resolve any situation with this DVD. I'm using it to understand the Bass version of the GT-10B. Thanks.,1364947200,,111,4.6
8329988,4,B001O9BGX6,"This guy is great.  I have a DVD of him explaining the digital recorder I bought that is equally easy to follow.

After struggling to make sense of my GT-10 and online BBs are so all over the place, this finally made everything ""click"" for me.  Now most all of it makes sense.  He's a master of making things look simple and his explanation of the chain of effects was spot-on.  I was this/close to ditching the GT-10 and buying a simpler unit but thought I'd give this one last try.  I just saved myself $500 and am thrilled to be getting out of the GT-10 what I bought it for.

Note: you'll need this WITH the manual--it doesn't have everything--but if you were having trouble grasping how to just get the basic tones set up and then take it from there, this is what you want.  Often times I need to see something to understand it rather than read it--if it's the same with you, well, here you go.",1327968000,,899,4.247058823529412
8329989,3,B001O9BGX6,This video was just ok.  For the price paid I thought in would go more in depth with the different features of the unit.  I felt that it mostly just helped you develop a custom tone.,1294185600,,182,4.027777777777778
8329990,5,B001O9BGX6,"Unless you are very familiar with the GT-10, don't even think of buying or using one without this DVD.  It is so easy to follow and it has some great tips and shortcuts that you are going to need with the advanced electronics of this guitar pedal effect.  I have had mine for more than a year and I still refer back to it from time to time.  Well worth the investment.",1290729600,3,368,4.083333333333333
