But I got a different version back in China couple years ago, along with Chinese Paladin 4 (the game) when it came out. This show basically introduce me to the world and culture of PAL. I watched the TV show before I play the original RPG, so I tend to side with the TV show. But from my perspective, I think this TV series is very very good, it match with most of the story line in the RPG (at least to the levels which I get through, never beat PAL 1 ).

It is a martial art / magic genre. So not your traditional Jinyong or Wong Fei Hung stories. Which made it special in some senses.

Even though the graphic is not really that good, it is acceptable, since it is based off of a game. Like that the Chinese Paladin RPG series, the main focus is the story. It is funny, sad at some points... the soundtracks are awesome. The casts are also very great. They used the original ending in this, I know there are multiple endings out in newer version of the game, but they stick with the old one in the TV version. Personally, I don't like this ending. But maybe it is this ending that made PAL famous...

Definitely recommended for people who love PAL. But 50 USD, this is quite expensive... compare to the 18 RMB I spent. And it is legal too, but it was just the economic version that is actually affordable to local living there (Bought in a super market).

Can't wait till Chinese Paladin 3 come out this summer!",1235865600,4,1484,4.178321678321678

8320192,4,B001LZXCTY,Great story although some parts were cliche and easily predicted... I watch it mainly for the action scenes and they were great.,1388102400,,128,4.863636363636363
8320193,5,B001LZXCTY,"Not sure if this version is as good as the one I have. The one I have is on just FOUR discs, not five as this one is. Though I can't speak of the visual quality and the quality of the English subtitles this one has, mine was of very good quality.

The drama series itself is the best martial arts fantasy series I have ever seen. And I've seen many. My personal DVD library is in excess of a thousand DVDs. And I have at least that many VHS tapes.

This is martial arts type FANTASY, not martial arts. So don't expect it to be Bruce Lee or Jet Li realistic action.

HOWEVER, if you compare it versus other fantasy, it will hold its own against the best that Hollywood has ever produced.
Further, I deem it artistically superior to any animated fantasy, such as Disney productions, since it contains real living human beings. And the acting skills overall in this production spanning the length of two dozen standard Hollywood movies CONSECUTIVELY is nothing short on astounding. To sustain the high level of acting this series had ranks it in its own stratosphere, above any movie that begins and ends in a couple hours.

The script was executed flawlessly, with no loose ends as are common in Hollywood fare. Although it doesn't have a Hollywood type ""happy ending.""

The music was as good or better than any of the other couple hundred Chinese or Korean TV series I have watched.",1368835200,,1381,4.48605577689243
8320194,5,B001LZXCTY,"i think this movie is a five star movie and a really great movie to watch, because its about true love and adventures",1356134400,,117,4.130434782608695
8320195,1,B001LZXCTY,"Very disappointed. There was no options for English sub-titles in spite of product discription saying there was. The first Disc was defective would not play in any of my DVD players. The other Disc played but did not offer a set up option. Could not enjoy it since I don't understand Cantonese. Thought of sending it back, but not worth the time effort or aggrevation. So I just threw it in the garbage. I'll never buy a Chinese TV series online.",1341878400,,446,4.518518518518518
8320196,5,B001LZXCTY,"This is a great series for those who love Chinese Drama, Anime, Soap opera, Japanese RPG, and anyone who is hooked on a good story with lots of sub plot and action. I have to give this a recommendation to anyone who is new to Chinese Drama or Asian live action TV drama. If you are an Anime fan looking to try real `live action' drama, start here. This should be in everyone's film collection. Ideal for its cinematography, story telling, costume, plot, scripting, and cross genre media and multimedia marketing strategy it is not only entertaining but also a great tool for inspiration and looking beyond the flat world of animation. Chinese Paladin was originally a RPG game, and this TV `soap opera' inspired drama (followed by Chinese paladin III-also recommended) is brilliant. If you want something entertaining, beautiful, and well worth the time and journey you will take from it, then adventure along with the characters in this epic gallant quest through scenic and beautiful fantasy land china. If you really don't want to enjoy a romantic fun and enlightened romp through a mystic world peppered with delightful characters and witty humor...then by all means, move along.",1323907200,5,1183,4.949748743718593
8320197,5,B001LZXCTY,"I watched this whole series. Was totally engrossed in the story as well as the characters. What a great performance by Yi Fei. Also her lover. The film itself was good, with nothing bad sticking out in terms of CGI or disc errors. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Kung Fu as well as romantic love stories. You will not be disappointed.",1321401600,5,341,4.428571428571429
8320198,5,B001LZXCTY,"The overall storyline is excellent as well as the casts, while the CG could use some improvement. I think this is by far the best drama series I've ever seen, but beware though this version has some quality control issues. If you can find a different version out there, I suggest you get that one because several discs have layer transitioning errors and read errors.",1276300800,8,367,4.661538461538462
