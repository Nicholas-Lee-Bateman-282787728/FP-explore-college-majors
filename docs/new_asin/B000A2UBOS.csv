2354673,1,B000A2UBOS,"A couple of friends recommended this and so I checked it out and I'll never listen to their recommendations again. Every other word out of the character's mouths (or minds) is a curse word. I don't mind cursing, but when it's used in place of a joke or funny situation, it's worthless and annoying. Jeremy's character is a part-time musician and full-time jerk who spends his time making terrible music and trying to score. The only funny bit in the whole first show was when Mark and his date listened to Jeremy's music and couldn't stop themselves from laughing. Unfortunately, what could have been a great scene mainly became an exchange of curse words in Jeremy and Mark's minds. If this series had gone for laughs instead of cheap trash talk, it really could have been funny.",1126828800,5,780,4.700729927007299
2354674,3,B000A2UBOS,"Jeremy and Mark are two loser roommates who spend most of their time screwing up their own lives. As they do, we get to hear their innermost thoughts and desires, most of which revolve around sex. There are some really funny scenes, but the characters are such losers that it's easier to grimace rather then laugh at their predicaments. Worth a watch, but rent it, don't buy it.",1126828800,3,378,4.573529411764706
2354675,2,B000A2UBOS,"Peep Show takes a new angle on the traditional roommate comedy by allowing us to hear the lead characters inner thoughts and feelings, along with the regular dialogue. Jeremy (Robert Webb) is the slacker roommate whose main desires are to have sex as much as possible and become a pop star without actually working at it. Mark (David Mitchell) is a shy and awkward nebbish who works for a faceless corporation. As with most roommates, Jeremy and Mark alternate between liking and hating each other as they encounter the typical sit-com situations - getting a job, getting a date, etc. Hearing their inner thoughts unfortunately wears thin quickly as most of their inner thoughts consist of repeated obscenities. In fact, I believe they break George Carlin's record for the most times saying ""f***"" in a cable show. The roommates are so unlikable that they grate on you almost immediately.",1126742400,2,888,4.966442953020135
2354676,5,B000A2UBOS,"Im an American and was living in London last fall... I happened upon Peep Show just flipping through my 5 channels, and was instantly hooked... Mark and Jeremy are F-ing HILARIOUS, at least their thoughts are, and this show is so true to life and wacky it will have you in stitches!  I only happened to see like 2 and a half episodes, and saw one commercial saying that the first season is coming on DVD, and i cant wait to get it and watch the rest... its so much fun, you gotta see it!",1124496000,13,487,4.126315789473685
2354677,5,B000A2UBOS,"As an American, I was thrilled to live in Europe last year; however, the Irish, Welsh, Scots and English have a marked difference in their preferred ""sitcoms"" to our own beloved overblown, baudy, curse-filled ones. I like the original Coupling, and indeed the original Office, but when I saw Peep Show for the first time, I fell completely in love.

Mark and Jeremy are roommates. The camera follows not only their lives, through their eyes (as in, the frame holds the hand and the cup of coffee coming towards the ""mouth"" etc.) but also their internal monologues. Hilariously awkward Mark is in love with Sophie, his office chum, and doesn't know when or how to give up his madcap pursuit. Jeremy dreams of being a rock star, but as yet fulfills only the role of lazy messy roommate.

From the first episode onward I was laughing out loud, constantly. I want to say it's a new kind of Britcom; but, rather, it's got a charm and comedy uniquely its own. I wouldn't place it in the same category as other popular ""BBC America"" productions...it's certainly much funnier than some of the stuff we have on American networks these days...

I've been dying for it to come out on US dvd since last year, and I'm thrilled to be ordering it now.

I have heard that Fox picked up ""Peep Show"" and its premise, but I am not sure if this means they are recasting and rewriting, or if they're airing the original Channel 4 episodes from the UK. Let's all hope for the latter!

I hope you enjoy Peep Show as much as I do. :-)",1123718400,34,1510,4.456521739130435

2354679,5,B000A2UBOS,"This show is really really great if you appreciate dry British humor.  The 1st person views are interesting and something that I wasn't used to seeing with American Television.  If you really like you could purchase this, but you can also watch it on Netflix.  They've had the show on for a few years and currently have seasons 1-8.",1389312000,,332,4.593220338983051
2354680,5,B000A2UBOS,"Haven't seen or even heard of Peep Show?  That's because it's from the BBC (although I've never seen it on BBCA).  This is adult fare: fun, bawdy and with language suitable for HBO, but if you're not easily offended this may well be the funniest show you've ever seen.  Think a modern, raunchy British version of the Odd Couple.

If you like Monty Python, Absolutely Fabulous or other British comedy, this is a must have!",1357430400,,421,4.573333333333333
2354681,4,B000A2UBOS,"From Mitchell and Webb, this long running series' takes place mostly through POV shots, meaning that the person thinking/narrating is usually off-screen.  It's funny, but trades in the humor of embarrassment that the British are so skilled at.  A few thoughts:

  - Olivia Coleman is one of a couple other regular characters in the show, an unrequited love interest for Mark (Mitchell's character) , and perhaps the best of the straight-figures in the show.  She has the best reaction shots, as it's usually she who finds Mark doing whatever awful thing he's driven to do by the end of the episode.
  - At the same time, the sexual humor in this series is far more explicit than you'd get on American television, at least mainstream broadcast television.  This demonstrates how skewed American priorities are-certain kinds of sex imagery would be absolutely off-limits on television, but the disgusting corpses on Bones are fair game (not to mention the squishy noises that go with them).
  - It took me a little while to get into the show -- I expected a higher quotient of direct laughs, as is the case in sketch comedy shows like That Mitchell and Webb Look.  Instead, the show goes on a slow burn, gradually revealing Mark's thundering insecurities and Jeremy's utter callousness.  My favorite part of this last aspect came late in the show, when Jeremy betrays Mark in a very specific way that mirrored exactly the way he himself had been betrayed by his pothead music partner just the episode before.

I think this is a funny show, but really more for those who appreciate the sense of humor in something like the BBC The Office.",1337731200,,1635,4.792857142857143
2354682,5,B000A2UBOS,"Watched this on a whim on Netflix and it's become my favorite sitcom. Amazingly remains hilarious and well written seven seasons in, which is normally when TV shows have long become stagnate. Granted each season only consists of six episodes, but I'm still impressed. I have seen all of Spaced and I thought it was alright, but I don't typically watch British sitcoms, only because I haven't researched them enough to know which are good. This is raunchy, witty, and even if you aren't familiar with British comedy I highly recommend it. Please release the rest of the series on region 1 DVDs! If they don't, I will buy a multi-region DVD player for the sole purpose of owning the rest of the series, that's how good it is.",1332720000,2,723,4.612403100775194

2354684,5,B000A2UBOS,"Peep Show is a hilarious and brilliant British comedy that has a cast of characters that have their lives so intertwined, that even the smallest occurrence has a domino effect in all their lives and with the constant character narration, it is like Seinfeld and The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy all rolled into one!",1329264000,,319,4.818181818181818

2354689,5,B000A2UBOS,"It's very rare that a TV show has both amazing writing AND amazing character actors.  The primary duo (Mitchell and Webb) play their respective polar-opposite parts perfectly: you can still believe they're friends, even with all the ridiculous amounts of friction and plotting.  And then the others, Super Hans, Johnson, Sophie, every last person they've ever cast is just spot-on.  And speaking of plotting: the writers have woven some great twists into every episode (like a more caffeinated Seinfeld, in a way), but also drop in some bits of philosophy and opinion (broadcast as the characters' inner thoughts) that are stunningly sharp and stinging.  Did I mention that the whole thing is damn funny?  As in, amazingly funny?  And no laugh track!!!!  YES!!!!",1278460800,4,762,5.146341463414634
2354690,3,B000A2UBOS,"Do I like the fact that Peep Show is presented from a 1st person POV with internal voice narration? Absolutely. Do I like the fact that neither character has an interesting story to tell? Absolutely not.
Key to Peep Show's success is the hilarious hook and line laugher at each episode's end. Unfortunately, it's not really worth sitting through 23 minutes of plodding drudgery highlighted by 3-4 successfully interspersed situational one liners. If you've seen two episodes of Peep, you've seen them all, but if you like the genre of 'funnified' office-centric comedies such as the Office, you'll enjoy Peep.",1268524800,2,609,5.1
2354691,5,B000A2UBOS,"We were first introduced to this series while vacationing in London.  Funny, quirky and full of uncomfortable moments, it's a good laugh.  We only wish we could get all of the other seasons in US format.",1261353600,2,203,4.611111111111111
2354692,5,B000A2UBOS,"This, along with 'The Office' and 'Spaced', is one of the most brilliant shows that I have watched. For fans of dry offbeat humor, look no further. My only complaint is that the subsequent seasons after this one are not available here in the U.S. As you can tell that is not much of a complaint against this first season, so yes, the show is wonderful and deserves a watch; Highly recommended.",1258416000,2,393,4.472222222222222
2354693,5,B000A2UBOS,"This is not (as some folk think) a BBC production, but a commission for Channel 4 which is as close as the UK gets to HBO. Yes it's absolutely great and currently (November '09) into it's sixth season. I'm a bit surprised that nobody thinks that it is very dirty (just wait for series 3), but perhaps you in the USA are more tolerant of extra broad humour. The stars David Mitchell & Robert Webb write the series and  have their own sketch show. Mitchell (the nerdy one) is also a regular guest on panel comedy shows where he is well known for some amazing put downs. I personally have only just recently started watching it and am up to season 3 but have 4 & 5 in the bag, and as there's only 6 episodes to a season will soon be up to speed. For those of you with Apple TV please note you may be able to download the whole lot (as we in the UK can) including series 6 in HD.",1258416000,2,875,4.028735632183908

2354695,5,B000A2UBOS,"It is nice to sometimes take off the American blinders and look to see what people are watching abroad.  This especially applies to Britain, where cutting edge, intelligent and avant garde comedy is still being made and shown, of all places, on public access networks.  Peep Show is one such fine example.  With only 6 episodes in a season, this series packs more laughs than several years' worth of most network comedies here in the US.  It seems each line in every 1/2-hour episode is a finely crafted piece of writing, well-thought-out, and often subtle.  So multiple watchings always bring out something new.

Fans of The Office, especially the British version, and Arrested Development will really enjoy this one.  And, a pleasant surprise, there are 4 more seasons, with season 6 ready to be shown in summer of 2009.",1240012800,5,822,4.870503597122302
2354696,4,B000A2UBOS,"Peep Show, now into its 5th series is perfectly pitched to capture the woes of the 20 something generation currently living in London. Mark (safe, conservative, anxious) lives with Jeremy (lazy, self-obsessed, hopelessly naive) in a grotty flat in Croydon (none of the palpably unrealistic 'Friends' style luxury apartments here). Their lives unfold hitting all the touchstones of modern life - the vanity, the junk nature of food and relationships, the self-obsession, the contractual ethos of sexual relationships.

The difference between their lives and yours is that theirs is much more tragic, farcical and funny. They don't get any wiser with time - they just plunge hopelessly from one messy enganglement to another, with hillarious results.",1233792000,2,748,5.448275862068965

Mark pays the rent through his thankless and uninspiring job at a credit company. Jeremy dreams of being a musician, but lacks both the talent and the ambition to go anywhere in that or any other industry.

The camera is positioned to give the impression that you see through the eyes of either Jeremy or Mark, and you can hear the thoughts of whomever's eyes the camera is currently looking through. The funniest lines come as thoughts, and they will make you cringe with their bluntness and occasional (you won't want to admit) familiarity.

The shiftless Oscar Madison character is charismatic but kind of an unfinished sketch; the uptight Felix Unger, who gets the bulk of the airtime, is a likeable sadsack with no clue in the lurv department of the kind you've seen in a thousand other shows.

The Office (UK) is my favorite TV show of all time, but ""Peep Show"" may be catching up...It's just so candid and truthful I can't believe it.

Here as usual, it's the mistakes and insecurities that provide for most of the laughs, and as with most British comedies, they're not offset by any sappy feelgood resolutions.

My only criticism of Peep Show is that it's hard to understand how Mark and Jeremy could be friends in the first place.  They're just too different for their relationship to be at all convincing, even if the show tried to establish that part of the story (which it doesn't).

Based on the comments, at least one of the revewers only watched the first episode, which I believe was the pilot and does not do justice to the full series.  My advise to the first time viewer; skip the first episode and watch the other 5 before watching the first one.

I was lucky enough just to return to the US from Europe and was able to purchase the second season, and watch three episodes from the 3rd.  If you like the first season wait until the next two, they are amazing.  Anyways, buy this DVD, I give it 5 stars.",1137283200,6,599,4.219298245614035
2354739,5,B000A2UBOS,"Uk Comedy is back on it`s feet after 10 years of No Bottle Comedy. Like the Music Scene at the Moment,the Uk is getting back

to the glorious past and i just hope our Friends in Yank Land get a chance to see this new wave comedy. Along with Little Britain and Ricky Gervais and the recent series Extras PEEP Show is simply brilliant. It`s Of a certain taste and that is for sure and it is fairly typical of Modern Day English People ie Swearing and Drinking far tooooooooooo much but the culture is starting to shine again with shows like this and Yes the Brits do indulge toooooooooo much in everything but when i see the new kind of revolution taking off again,I Am a happy man. It`s really not worth explaining the Ins and outs of this show other than to say,Be Different and give it a go you will laugh and will not be dissapointed. Peep show is everything that the Uk really is and i love it for that. It is worth watching just to see the Character Big Suze played by Sophie Winkleman. Wow what a stunning bird. Give it a go it`s superb although i find it amazing that a lot of people in the Uk don`t even watch it as it is on a less popular station Ch4. Thank God i am one of the lucky ones.

2354740,5,B000A2UBOS,"I am happy to hear that there is a second and third season of this show.  The first season was brilliant.  Non-stop laughs over the insane ""odd couple"" behavior with Jeremy's crackpot ideas, and Mark's judgmental tolerance.

The only downside is the lack of episodes.  Only 6 episodes in the first series.  However, that 6 episodes is about the same price as many 2 hour movies on DVD.

Give it a shot.  I love this series.",1133049600,37,423,4.4868421052631575
2354741,5,B000A2UBOS,"This is the kind of show you're either going to get and love, or not and hate (a-la the office).  As other reviewers have said, it follows the life of these two sad individual roommates. Yes, there is a fair amount of swearing in the show, but people do tend to swear more in London (where this is set) compared to many places in the USA (in general conversation). It is very quirky and certain parts make you feel uncomfortable for the characters, but again, this is not meant to be a laugh out loud comedy show, the humor is far more subtle.

So, if you need a laugh track to help you on your way, don't bother, however if you can appreciate clever, sometimes subtle humor from the U.K, then this might be right up your alley!",1131840000,15,728,4.268115942028985
2354742,5,B000A2UBOS,"This comedy follows in the English comedy tradition of cringe worthy characters (Faulty Towers - Basil Faulty, The Office - David Brent etc) whose delusional nature and general ability to make any situation awkward leads to tragic hilarity. If you're the type of person who enjoys dubbed laughter and superficial ""Friends"" type characters, then this isn't the DVD for you, as the humour doesn't have standard joke-line punch-line make up. Rather what's funny about this comedy is the characters' lost nature, all trying desperately to be something that they not, never sure of what they should be doing and messing up anything that they do undertake. To that extent, this isn't a good comedy if you're not paying full attention to it, but if you watch closely and think about the characters' motivation then I this is probably the best comedy in the world.",1131667200,13,856,4.951388888888889
2354743,5,B000A2UBOS,"I loved this collection of six episodes, but I can understand why some people don't like it. The humor is similar to Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development,  and The Office. The story is about two roommates, one is an uptight business flunky, the other a lazy musician wannabe.  The main characters are always getting themselves into embarrassing situations (mostly with the opposite sex). Think of an early 30 something Larry David with an office job in England.

I'm huge fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, and The Office so I think Peep Show is hilarious! If you are a fan of that type of humor check out Peep Show. It's a great deal for under $20.",1127520000,26,671,4.717948717948718
2354744,3,B000A2UBOS,"This show uses the inventive device of having the viewer hear the unexpressed thoughts and ideas of the two main characters, Mark and Jeremy. Unfortunately, the thoughts and ideas are pretty boring and tend to distract and not enhance. In addition, the unusual camera angles and moves used to express their inner thoughts make the show seem jerky and without proper pacing. There are some funny bits, but not enough to make this a ""must-see"" show. The best part of the DVD is the extra scenes that feature the characters without the inner thoughts device. In particular, Jeremy's audition tape for Big Brother is absolutely hysterical. If only the regular episodes could have been this good.",1126828800,2,691,4.9655172413793105

8073520,2,B000A2UBOS,"I have enjoyed the British Comedy series, particularly Come Fly With Me and Little Britain ! There are many more of course. This film did not measure up; perhaps I missed the humor as I live in US and was not familiar with some of the seemingly ""inside"" jokes and suggestions. There were some humorous moments and situation, but overall I didn't know which direction the episodes were headed. The ending left me hanging and I endured the series hoping that it would improve. Unfortunately, it did not. I am sure, looking at the reviews, that this is a minority opinion, but feel that I could have made a better selection. I had nothing to go except others ratings and the film did not measure up to the unusually high number of favorable reviews.",1403740800,,746,4.574626865671642
8073521,5,B000A2UBOS,"Next year it will have been a decade since I first watched Peep Show and I am still watching Peep Show. This show is hilarious. It has to be one of the best comedy shows ever put on TV. I just do not understand why this show never got more press. I was talking the other day with someone about what shows we would take with us if we could only watch one thing for the rest of our lives. This show wins for giving the most laughs. I have watched every episode of every season countless times and I still crack up laughing out loud. The characters in the show are all awesome - Super Hands, Johnson....but Mark and Jez are just the best. I recommend this to everyone I know. I am just so glad this show exists. It never gets old, it never gets boring. One time a friend came to visit me and instead of leaving my apartment and giving him a tour of Chicago we watched four seasons of Peep Show. We had the best time!",1403222400,2,913,4.0497237569060776
