8493142,5,B00652EV5W,"Another winner from Happy Traum, America's premier acoustic guitar teacher and performer.

This DVD demystifies the Open D tuning, and helps the student overcome the fear of going out of standard tuning.  His persona is easy going, confident, humble, while maintaining enthusiasm for the music, which is contagious.  Happy's style helps the student move slowly, and has chosen songs that build one upon the other, with instant and quick success with the first song, while bringing up the challenge as the songs progress.  He chooses tunes that are enjoyable to play, and enjoyable to listen to, as he is a natural teacher but also a performer.  Acutely aware of the challenges his students face, gauging much from the feedback given to him through his website and forum, Happy Traum delivers yet another excellent lesson for students of acoustic guitar.

Beginning with going into Open D tuning with ease, he then gives us the simple fingering of the chords, showing how they make 'sense' in this tuning, giving us a rich, ringing sound.  John Henry, although simple, has a nice sound to it in open tuning, and gives us tips on how to dress or improvise from there.  ""Sitting on Top of the World"" and ""I'll Fly Away"" are my two favorites, though the others are great to learn. ***** Teaching from a gifted and experienced instructor.",1322697600,3,1333,4.867256637168142
