1331547,5,B00003L9BF,"I fell in love with this 1974 movie and finally found a DVD release of it some years ago.  Since another release of it is May 6, 2008, I'm wondering if there are any extras on this one that would make me buy it also?  Maybe audio commentary, deleted scenes, interviews, etc.
Unless there are, it couldn't be any better than the original!",1208217600,,337,4.333333333333333
1331548,4,B00003L9BF,"After the massive success of Easy Rider in 1969, several sub-genres in film were spawned. You had Biker Films, Hippie/Drug Films and Redneck Roughies. Redneck Roughies were low budget films that took place in the South consisting of car chases, shootouts, rough language and some nudity. Walking Tall is considered one of the top guns in this sub-genre with Macon County Line sitting about redneck-and-redneck with it. In fact, both films share a common actor, a pre-teen idol Leif Garrett.

Max Baer, Jr. of Beverly Hillbillies fame attempts to shake off his Jethro Bodine luggage he'd been carrying around since the series cancellation and just about succeeds. As writer, producer and star, he does a good job coming up with a script with a great twist ending. His portrayal of the friendly but bigoted small town sherriff has such depth that you almost forget it's Jethro!

The rest of the cast is just as good, the Vint brothers play the happy-go-lucky (maybe not so lucky here) brothers with gusto as well as Joan Blackman as the sassy hitch hiker they pick up. The 2 actors (who's names I can't remember) that play the twisted drifters really unnerve you. Then there's the sherriff's deputy that really chews up the screen in an interrogation scene that will have you gripping the armchair.

The story is bascally about being at the wrong place at the wrong time with a startling revelation at the end. Baer had end notes tacked on that give you the impression that this is a true story, but from what I've read this is not true. But true or not, it's still a well written story.

Best of my knowledge Baer did only one follow up, the kinder and gentler Redneck Roughie Ode To Billy Jo based on the hit song by Bobbi Gentry. Still, old Max managed to crank out a low budget film that still holds up well today. A definitive classic Redneck Roughie for anybody who likes their films cheap, gritty and intensely well done.",1206230400,2,1926,4.672566371681416

1331550,5,B00003L9BF,"Max Baer's friendly fascist is one reason, but not the only one, to catch this disturbing 1974 film. In fact, Baer's smiling, upright sheriff seems a blood brother in some twisted sense to Mayberry's  Andy Griffith.  Based on fact, the movie portrays the misadventures of real-life brothers Alan and Jesse Vint, as they frolic through the 1950's South on their way to a date with the Army. Bad luck and Sheriff Baer however turn their joyride into a nightmare that finally ends in tragedy. The last scenes are a suspense-filled stunner. This is Baer's production and he uses it to observe the effects of gun culture, brutality, and race prejudice in fairly subtle fashion. Except for Geoffrey Lewis's overdone station attendant, the acting is first rate, with Joan Blackman a long way from her frothy Elvis movies. Special recognition should go to the casting of the two southern lowlifes who are the most convincing and sinister drifters I've seen, and are guaranteed to put chills up the spine. At times the script seems too deliberate, as though there are explanations for everything. Still, this is a first-rate thriller that deserves its cult status, and is ultimately a long, long way from the bucholic ideal of Sheriff Andy's Mayberry.",991440000,9,1242,4.966346153846154
1331551,3,B00003L9BF,"An intense  adult drama, with a common plot element of an ""innocent"" female traveller (Ally Sheedy) who gets jailed in a southern jail on trumped-up charges, raped and beaten and otherwise abused by her captors, until another inmate (David Carradine) steps in (through the cell bars), grabs the bad cop, (who ends up dead) and the escape is on. The Sheriff is the usual dirty cop, who pursues the escapees ruthlessly, with Ally Sheedy's character resorting to more & more crime in her desperation to get away from the hell she's experienced, all the while being helped by, but not quite trusting, Carradine's ex-con. The violent subject matter makes it understandable why no one under 18 is allowed to buy this movie here, but all in all, it's a decent flick of its genre, with good performances by the leads.",985737600,2,809,4.7785714285714285
1331552,4,B00003L9BF,"If you're a fan of low budget film making, the story behind the making of ""Macon County Line"" is as fascinating as the film itself, perhaps moreso.  You'll learn about that in a short featurette that's included on the DVD that features interviews with Director Richard Compton, Actor-Producer-Writer Max Baer, Jr., star Jesse Vint and others.  What I really enjoyed is the film commentary offered by Richard Compton during the film.  It's actually more of a conversation with Anchor Bay producer Bill Lustig, a pretty good low budget film maker, himself (Maniac, Vigilante, Maniac Cop), about how the film came to be.  Listening to the two directors talking about how to get the most out of a small budget (just over $200,000 for the film) is a real education.  Lustig is a very good interviewer/commentator and has shown up on other Anchor Bay releases (his own ""Vigilante"" comes to mind).
The film, itself, is a much better-than-average story about mistaken identities and the tragic consequences that result.  The cast is generally good and the acting is a lot better than what one might typically expect from drive-in fare.  Max Baer, Jr., in particular, gives depth to a character that could have been played as ""Sheriff Jethro Bodine.""  Baer wanted to break away from his ""Beverly Hillbillies"" image and, for the most part, he succeeds.  Anchor Bay's widescreen edition looks great.  I can't vouch for the sound since I don't have an elaborate audio system, but Anchor Bay generally has a reputation for doing good things with the available source material.
Fans of 70's era drive-in movies will really enjoy ""Macon County Line.""",984960000,32,1635,4.977941176470588
1331553,5,B00003L9BF,"Critical acclaim is not exactly the way to describe Macon County Line.  This film, with many of the other 70's classic drive-in features, is an absolute classic but didn't rate highly with critics.  Alan and Jesse Vint,  although not Hollywood royalty, deserve a place in film history for their  parts as brothers who become the victims of horrible circumstances.  Alan  and Jesse popped up in other films through the 70' and 80's (most notably  ""Centennial""), but ""Macon County"" is their opus.  It's  just a shame that their talents were never showcased like this again. They  are outstanding actors.  The film has impact, and the DVD version is like  watching it for the first time.  WOW!  What a film.  If you are like me, a  child of the 70's, and using Amazon and e-auctions to build nostalgic movie  and music libraries, put this one in your DVD collection.

1331650,3,B00003L9BF,"""Macon County Line"" belongs to the redneck car/thriller genre, which overlaps with Southern Gothic (e.g. ""The Fugitive Kind"") and redneck car/comedies (e.g. ""Smokey and the Bandit""). Many of these films take place in the South, but not always; there are tons of rednecks all over, even in the most ""progressive"" states, like California and Washington.

The plot revolves around two brothers in 1954 traveling through North Carolina. After picking up a lone female, their car breaks down in Macon County where they encounter a bigoted Sheriff. A crime takes place and the sheriff blames the trio.

The film only runs 89 minutes and the first hour is all small town tedium, which is part of the movie's low-budget charm, but the third act livens things up.

The screenplay was written by Max Baer Jr., best known as Jethro on the Beverly Hillbillies TV series; he also plays the redneck Sheriff in the story. Max, incidentally, directed another redneck classic, 1976's ""Ode to Billy Joe"".

The film has a good back country vibe and effectively shows how bigotry and racism are learned traits and not innate. It also shows how easy it is to blame the wrong person due to coincidence. Beyond this, the film has little depth. It's a light drama about mundane events in a small Southern town that turn to tragedy.

The movie purports to be based on a true story and offers details to this effect, but this was merely fabricated in order to hype the picture. It worked, as ""Macon County Line"" became a drive-in hit in the mid-70s.

My main beef with the film, other than its mundaneness, is that the story takes place in Macon County, North Carolina, but the picture was shot in the Big Valley of California (around Sacramento). It goes without saying, if you're going to film a Southern Gothic thriller that takes place in the South, shoot it in the REAL South, not friggin' California. That said, the filmmakers do a decent job of making it SEEM like the South, dry as California is.

Nothing could be further than the truth.  This film is a snapshot of a time and place in history about two guys in the wrong place.  This could just as well have been contemporary Philadelphia instead of the Jim Crow South in the 1950s.  Director Richard Compton effectively and subtlety captures the mood of the time with oppression percolating beneath the surface.  Max Baer has also crafted a multilayered witty script that belies the way the film was promoted.  Speaking of Baer, he plays the avenging peace officer here but there's more complexity to it.  Baer's character is as sympathetic as the Vint brothers who are the unfortunate victim of circumstance.  ""Macon County Line"" is ultimately a thoughtful film and a definite sleeper from a decade that produced a lot of great films.",1325980800,3,933,4.974193548387097

It could be a case of reality being stranger (and more unbeleivable) than fiction, or maybe it was just a bad treatment of the story's final and crucial events.

* SPOILERS *

I enjoyed the 1973 vibe and the performances of the main stars more in the first half of the movie.  I wouldn't fault it for occasional slowness in the second half, but where it fails is in its final scenes when the cop and his boy are chasing the two guys and the girl.  We don't see the cop getting shot, nor do we see his son actually kill one of the brothers.  We're left instead with tell-tale impressions - the cop lying dead in the bushes, the dead brother and the boy with the gun in his hands.  But the kid - what is he, 10 years old? - has prior to this demonstrated none of the qualities that would put me to believing he is even capable of this, with the result that by the end of the film I feel a little ripped off as a viewer.  In these critical final scenes the film-maker does more telling rather than showing, as if afraid to give a realistic interpretation, or any interpretation at all, of how ""the facts"" occured.  Bottom line is that the final scenes are very short and unconvincing and didn't leave me with much of an impression of the overall movie.

Especially after reading some of the glowing reviews on this listing.

This movie had 5-star potential in terms of its actors, location and film style, but while the gun is loaded and ready to shoot, when it finally does, it's shooting blanks.  Not hard to understand why this film didn't fly on original release.  All's well that ends well, and unfortunately this movie did not end well.  While it wasn't terrible, I wouldn't go so far as to recommend it to anyone.",1317686400,,1959,4.375690607734807

1331678,5,B00003L9BF,"Back in the 70s, Hollywood was riding a wave of darker, more interesting films. Movies like EASY RIDER, BONNIE AND CLYDE, and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (at the tail-end of the 60s) had helped to spawn a series of movies that all seemed to start out light-heartedly, but would end in tragedy. Good examples are MACABE AND MRS. MILLER, BOXCAR BERTHA, and, of course, DELIVERANCE. Among these was a little independent film called MACON COUNTY LINE, which concerns two brothers (played by the real-life Vint brothers) who set out on a fun-filled odyssey, only to meet w/ a terrible fate. In keeping w/ it's decade, MCL starts out as a near-comedy, only to spin out of control, ending as a horrific tale of death and revenge. Max Baer wrote, produced, and stars in this classic. A must for all fans of 70s thrillers or 70s cinema in general...",1300147200,2,847,4.653333333333333
1331679,3,B00003L9BF,"This movie is a period piece set in the fifties. I have a vast collection of older films. I myself sometimes will order a movie i've never seen before based on someone else opinion. This movie just doesn't make the grade. The plot of this film is about two brothers who are on a two week leave, and are traveling around the usa in their 48 plymouth convertable. They are supposed to be going out for one last goodtime before they reinlist in the military. Eventually they pick up a female hitchhiker along the roadside and there is some witty banter between the brothers and the female character. Then it's a downward spiral from here they get into town and there fuelpump goes out. So they don't have the money to buy a new one, so they have the local mechanic jerry rig it to get them on there way. Then after wating an exhausting 5 hours, they are once again on the road. The local sheriff gives them a hardtime since they are not locals and tells them to leave town as soon as possible. Then that's when things get kinda of interesting. While the sheriff drives off to military school to pick up his young son for a weekend hunting trip, two drifters break into his home and murder his wife. The two brothers and there female companion break down on the side of the road, right out in front of the sheriffs home. Little do they know that his wife was just murdered. So the three decide it's best to find a place to sleep for the night, so the wander through the woods until they find a barn. Meanwhile the sheriff arrives home and see's there 48 plymouth on the side of the road. The sheriff pulls up to the house with his son to find his wife murdered. He assumes it must be the kids from the gas station. Then the sheriff goes on a psychotic shooting spree chasing after the three of them throught the woods. It just gets dumber from hear on out, they don't understand why he's trying to kill them and the moron doesn't wait to even get anyother officer's opoinion before trying to kill everyone. Anyway when the movie finally comes to a painful but slow ending, I felt like I was robbed of my money, because I went off the opinion's of others to buy it in the first place. Anyway in conclusion this movie is not great nor horrible. Just boring.",1295827200,,2251,4.32387706855792

1331684,4,B00003L9BF,"Real life brothers Alan and Jesse Vint, are cast as brothers Chris and Wayne Dixon, in this film. The Dixon brothers are about to enlist in the military. So they decide to head from Chicago to New Orleans, to have some fun before they report for their induction, in two weeks.

The Dixon brothers do have some fun during their journey, and even pick-up a pretty young woman who's hitchhiking. But when their car breaks-down, they have to wait for the repair shop to get the correct parts for it, before they can be on their way. This takes longer than Chris and Wayne figured on. Their troubles really begin though, when the local Sheriff's wife is brutally murdered in their home, and the Sheriff mistakenly thinks Chris and Wayne are the culprits.

This story-line in this movie took place in the 1950s, when the deep south could be a particularly dangerous place, for outsiders passing through. It's based on a true story, which makes it even more chilling. Alan and Jesse Vint really project a brotherly chemistry between them with ease. Guess it helps that they're brothers in real life. Max Baer Jr. (know as Jethro from the Beverley Hillbillies) plays the Sheriff with menacing relish. A young Leif Garrett plays the Sheriff's son Luke. Leif shows an amazing emotional fluency, in his role.

This film is a cut above many of the drive-in B films, that were so ubiquitous during the 70s when this movie was made. Decent character development, and a plot that's thick with danger and suspense, are the main reasons for this factor. It's definitely worth a watch, especially if you like films that are compelling and visceral.",1261958400,7,1630,4.752650176678445

1331687,5,B00003L9BF,"A great big thank you to Warner Video for re-releasing Macon County Line on DVD. I sorely lamented missing the last DVD release, which resulted in having nothing to choose from but some very expensive even used copies floating around once the title was out-of-print or poor quality bootleg copies. I recommend grabbing this release while you can. Max Baer hit on a goldmine with the totally unexpected smash success of the film in 1974. This was especially amazing when you consider that it mainly played on the drive-in circuit during the initial release. Those who only know Max Baer as Jethro Bodine on The Beverly Hillbillies will be in for a great surprise at the vast difference from that comical character and the character he portrays in Macon County Line. The theme song was sung by the lovely Bobbie Gentry of Ode to Billy Joe fame. The only thing that could maybe be better than having this classic film available once again on DVD would be to have the chance to watch it under the stars at a drive-in on a warm summer night. Don't miss it!! But a little bit surprised that this DVD release has no extras at all, not even the original trailer. Why??",1210896000,15,1160,4.581730769230769
