8596103,5,B00DPOTTBY,"I agree with the other poster -- this is a BOOTLEG. I have ordered the Director's Cut available from Korea. It will take a month to get to you but it will be 10 double layer DVDs, nothing less, and will be Region One, not ""region free"". Whenever you see something that says ""region free"" 9 times out of 10 it will be a bootleg.",1387152000,2,327,4.046153846153846
