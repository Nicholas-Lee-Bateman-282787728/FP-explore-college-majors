8504305,4,B006U13AM8,"It's always fun to watch Paul Revere and the Raiders performing, and I suspect that most people buying this dvd are expecting a standard concert film, but that's not really what this is. It's more of a documentary style presentation, covering the events surrounding a group of troops being sent off to war in Iraq on Thanksgiving weekend, 2004. We see the band flying in for the concert, setting up, and parts of the performance. After the concert, we see the troops being served a Thanksgiving dinner, with Paul Revere himself helping out. Then we see the morning after, as these honorable young people board the plane that will take them overseas. It was quite commendable of Paul and the Raiders to do this show for our service men and women, even if most of them probably only know of the group through their parents or grandparents. I just wish they had focused more on the concert on this dvd, but what there is of it is very good. Long time Raiders drummer and singer Omar Martinez is really the star of the show here, with his vocals on With a Little Help From My Friends (heard complete), Fortunate Son, and a Medley (pun intended) of Righteous Brothers songs. Paul is hilarious, as usual, and does a rip-roaring turn at piano, playing Like Long Hair and Great Balls of Fire. The important thing about this dvd, though, if you buy it at [...] is all the proceeds to go assist homeless veterans.",1377043200,11,1403,4.571428571428571
