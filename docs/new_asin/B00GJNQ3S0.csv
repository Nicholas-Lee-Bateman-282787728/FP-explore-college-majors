6080031,5,B00GJNQ3S0,A lovely film gently done the ending made me cry! I guess having children would do it! Everyone should see this film many lessons to be learned.,1387411200,5,144,4.37037037037037
6080032,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"I have to say that I have never been a big fan of Eugenio Derbez... Mexican humor is a bit difficult for me to ""get"" and enjoy.  I do think he is a real talent as far as voices are concerned (he has done voice over for many Disney and animated movies) in Spanish and he does a wonderful job.

Having said this, I was so surprised I loved his role in this movie... Nor only his acting but  the fact that he produced and co-wrote the story.  Wonderful job!  It was a very good movie that transitioned between drama and comedy seamlessly.

I personally have 2 kids and am not sure this is a family type movie.

I very much recommend this movie...  Good acting and a very nice story.",1386115200,37,679,4.129770992366412
6080033,4,B00GJNQ3S0,"""Instructions Not Included"" (2013 release from Mexico; 115 min.; original title ""No se Aceptan Devoluciones"", which means ""Returns Not Accepted"") brings the story of Valentin, a single guy living ""la vida loca"" in Acapulco. In a quick montage, we see him hooking up with a slew of women. Then one day, an ex-girlfriend, an American woman named Julie, shows up at his apartment with a baby. She hands Valentin the baby, asks for $10 to pay the cab, and of course does not come back. Valentin is completely overwhelmed with this baby, and for a while the movie feels like ""Two Men and a Baby"". But not long thereafter, through a clever montage, we see the little girl (whose name we learn is Maggie) turning into a 6 yr. old. Because Maggie is desparate to see her mom, Valentin and Maggie decide to move to Los Angeles, and after hitchhiking their way from Acapulco to LA, Valentin ends up getting a job as a stunt double in Hollywood. Life is good but then one day, he gets a call out of the blue from Julie, now living in New York and wanting to come see Maggie. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is a triumph for Eugenio Derbez, who directs, stars (as Valentin), co-writes and co-produces this delightful movie. Second, the movie swings back-and-forth between comedy and drama without any problem. But the funniest scenes are truly laugh-out-loud funny. The American influences on this movie are very clear (from ""Two Men and a Baby"" early on to ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" deep into the movie), yet it is all brought with a refreshing new look and take. Third, there are a number of other remarkable performances besides Derbez, none more so than Loreto Peralta as the 6 yr. old Maggie. Besides speaking both English and Spanish fluently, Peralta beams on the screen with her vibrant personality. We surely will see this little girl in more movies! Check out also Daniel Raymont as Frank, Valentin's boss and friend oin the studio lot. In a blink-it-and-you-will-miss-it scene, it appears that Johnny Depp makes a cameo as ""Aztec Man"", the movie for which Valentin serves as a stunt double. (Turns out that it's not Depp, but instead a mere Depp-lookalike.) Last but not least, look out for the ending of the movie, which I did not see coming at all! (No worries, I won't spoil.)

This movie has become an unexpected box office hit since its release in late August. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati in early September was PACKED, I am happy to say. That said, there is a reason this movie is rated PG-13. This is NOT a family movie a la Disney, so do yourself (and your children) a favor and do not take your 7 yr. old or 10 yr. old to see this. But for the rest of us, this movie is like a breath of fresh air among the seemingly non-stop comic book superhero movies and other assorted Hollywood mega-ness. ""Instructions Not Included"" is one of those ""little movies that could"". If you are ready for a quality foreign movie that will make you laugh but will also touch you, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Instructions Not Included"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1385942400,16,3223,4.603478260869565

6080052,2,B00GJNQ3S0,"This movie is a good mix of comedy and drama, but there is so much questionable content, it is NOT something I would recommend for a classroom.  I saw some teachers wrote raving reviews and recommended this for high school Spanish students, but the objectionable content is abundant and spread throughout the movie.

The main character, Valentin, goes from one relationship to another until Julie (a woman he slept with whose name he could not even remember) shows up with a baby (Maggie) and says the baby is Valentin's.  Valentin raises Maggie and eventually builds a home that essentially consists of a playground for Maggie as the centerpiece of the home.  Then Julie shows back up, brings her girlfriend to meet Maggie and suing for custody.  The emotional drama in the story is good, but there are so many questionable themes mixed in, the movie ends up being inappropriate for younger audiences.

Strong language included multiple uses of f****, s***, d****, along with milder words to which some parents would object, and there is a scene with a mother smoking around her baby.  The movie includes sex / bedroom scenes (although not extremely explicit, PLENTY is very obviously implied, such as the main character waking up with two women in his bed) along with plenty of cleavage, sexually suggestive dialogue, and even one instance of rear male nudity.

The questionable themes in the movie include some that could be used for good discussions, but the movie either glosses over them or plays off the situations in a favorable light.  Issues include:
1)  Rampant objectification of women;
2)  Illegal immigration;
3)  International kidnapping (any family who has had to deal with a country that does not follow custody laws knows this is not an issue to be glossed over); and
4)  Lying to a child to the extent that she cannot differentiate between reality and fantasy.

The movie is not wholesome and has so many bad messages mixed in with the good, I can not understand why any teacher would recommend this for the classroom.  The basis of the story was great, but it was executed poorly, opting for raunchy comedy instead of something family-friendly.",1525737600,,2164,4.906593406593407

6080073,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"My husband & I had watched ""How to Be a Latin Lover"" starring Eugenio Derbez and Loved it. Hilarious all the way through.
This film is more serious but also has a lot of hilarious scenes. This film shows how a Latin Lover becomes a single Dad. He is such a loving father. Then the mother (who deserted her daughter as an infant) comes back, demanding custody. Complications ensue.
It is a beautifully realized story with Excellent acting by all. The little girl is phenomenal. The ending is sad but strangely uplifting (I do believe in Heaven so this is the hopeful part).
Throughout, Eugenio Derbez directs with care and love. The colors are absolutely beautiful: tangerines, golds, bright reds, verdant greens.",1513641600,,712,4.844262295081967

Single dad is left to raise the boy and heads to Southern California for better job opportunities.  Derbez, currently Latin America's No. 1 comedian, is wonderful in this debut.  While I thought the plot structure was a bit on the hackneyed side, Derbez's honest brio and manic comic timing carry the show.

It is neither high comedy or high drama, just one of those charming indie movies you come across sometimes.  There is a twist at the end that will change the way you feel about the film so, if not initially your cup of tea, try and stick it out.  The film starts out like it is crass but this is part of the set up and quickly passes.  Also, don't be deterred by the subtitles.  The movie does not overly depend on dialog, most is in English, and the Spanish scenes are so obvious that you pretty much don't need the subtitles anyway.",1486339200,7,643,4.195121951219512

He is the one of the leads in this film and shares some amazing chemistry and fantastic chemistry with his co-star  Maggie (Loreto Peralta) that reminds me of a very old Charlie Chaplin film which I think was called the Kid..
At the beginning of the film Derbez is a playboy called Valentin, who is forced to take care of a baby when one of his lovers leaves that with him. So Valentin tries to find the mother Julie in the United States.

It is an easy film to follow and love but many of the jokes are targeted towards Latin Americans. However the kid and the main lead share a great screen presence.

6080169,4,B00GJNQ3S0,"I'll give it 3.75 stars. This had a lot of scenes that were heartwarming, inspiring, sad, and then terribly devastating. The ending is a bit confusing and it just sort of dumps a lot of stuff on you emotionally in a very blunt and abrupt way. It's hard to say anything more without giving it away. Let's just say there are a few very painful scenes which almost makes it hard to deal with emotionally. And by the way, most of this is in Spanish (with subtitles) along with small portions in English. Not sure why this is classified as a comedy. There are some cute and funny moments along the way, but this is more of a touching story rather than any kind of 'laugh out loud' comedy.",1445644800,,683,4.3023255813953485

She flees instantly (after asking him 10 dollars for the taxi, a gag repeated several times in the film), leaving the daughter to him. He goes to the US with the baby in order to find her mother. He is unable to find her but he settles in LA with his daughter (whom we see grow up to become a cute 7 years old blonde played by Loreto Peralta) finding a job as a stunt double and becoming an unusual but loving dad. Eventually, (SPOILERS AHEAD: if you want to see the movie stop reading here) more than half ways into the film, the also irresponsible Julie returns to fetch Maggie and the movie turns into a comedic Kramer vs Kramer.

The story is about a bachelor in Mexico that is suddenly faced with raising his half-American daughter, goes in search of the girl's mother and falls in love with his child. He does what any fearless father would do, raises her in America his own way, and all is right with the world until the mother steps back into the picture.

This movie is about a man coming full circle in his life,  for the love of his child.  Very, good acting and so well written, I loved all the twists and turns.  I was surprised at the ending,",1405209600,,401,4.076923076923077
6080313,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"This is a film that I have passed up several times when choosing a film to watch, but finally decided to give it a chance.  The cover was not that enticing and I had honestly never heard of the film, though I saw it was just released last year.

I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  It was one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  It was moving, yet funny, and the story line was very well written.  The film is about a bachelor living in Acapulco, who has no interest in having a family or settling down.  One day a prior lover shows up at his door, hands him a baby and leaves.  Up until this point, I was still unsure of the film but thankfully continued watching.

He tries to return the child by crossing the border illegally (the mother was American) but when he is unable to find her he realizes he cannot cross the border back.  Doing so would put them both at risk since he originally crossed illegally and the child looks more American than Mexican.  From this point, you watch this selfish playboy who wanted nobody to care about beyond himself, evolve into a loving father.  He even takes a life threatening job as a stuntman in Hollywood to ensure that his child would have the life he feels she deserves.

Through the film you watch the father indulge his child with everything she wants.  Their home looks more like a FAO Schwarz than a home and he plays with her as if he is a child himself.  He lets her skip school to be on set with him while he is doing stunts and to do activities at home.  It may seem in the first half to three quarters of the film that this is a father who does not know what is best for his child.  He is not giving her the ""structure"" that a child needs and is scrutinized by those on the outside looking in.

Without spoiling the ending of the film, which had a surprising twist, you find that he was doing exactly what was best for his child all along.  The writers did a fantastic job of keeping the ending unpredictable, which is something I have found hard to find in recent films.

This film was warm, entertaining, well written and well directed.  A 5 star film all the way and highly recommended to all.",1405209600,,2168,4.216019417475728

Plays kind of a ladies man who has sex with woman after woman and eventually get one pregnant. She dumps the child with him and he falls in love. I don't think this is t much of a spoiler because it happens in the first 20 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie is what counts. I don't want stay to much, but the father and daughters relationship is so perfect. Ive always been so impressed with Mexican made movies. They manage to be simple and profound at the same time.

But this film gives that which may be familiar or predictable in plot a whole new bend and twist.  I cannot but agree with what other 4-star and 5-star reviewers have stated - this is too good of a movie to miss.  I did select English subtitles but the combination of Spanish and English dialogue in the script only enhances the uniqueness of a well-written script transferred by excellent acting and direction unto the big screen.

6080347,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"I normally try to avoid writing reviews because they take some time out of your life. Time that you could use to get things done, like chores, for example. But I broke that rule today after watching this movie during my break from chores. And I am glad that I did. Anyway, I feel that everyone should watch this movie for what it teaches and the love that it brings out.
First, I did not know anything about this movie when I watched it. I had no idea who Eugenio Derbez is and I simply did not care that it was English subtitled due to Spanish dialogue for a lot of parts. But after watching this movie, I came away with more than I could get from a long lesson in Spanish (I took advanced placement in Spanish in college due to my love of the culture). But I was impressed with this movie's use of the rich cultural aspects of the people in Mexico. Well, enough of the academe and on to the movie...
I will not spill out the beans on what happens in this movie. I will just give vague terms for this movie so as not to ruin it for anybody. The fact that I didn't know anything about this movie actually worked for me. Had I known the plot, it might have taken a little away for me.
The main theme of this movie is about overcoming one's fears. It is presented in all kinds of forms that are really hilarious. The uses of allegory is ingenious. It is used extremely well. I really loved the initial presentation of the protagonist's childhood. Those scenes really endeared the character to me.
This movie delves much into the adoptive parenting that many have had difficulties with as adopted children. I have a friend whose sister renounced her parents because they did not tell her that she was adopted (this movie is not about this point so don't worry it's not going to ruin it for you that way).  I could never understand the sister's behavior going as far as making a mockery of the adoptive mother's funeral. That was truly sad and tragic. This movie will pronounce what it means to be an adoptive parent or otherwise. When a parent raises a child alone it and does everything in his or her powers to give that child a happy life, he or she is a true parent. Just because he has a job that may take him or her away for many an event or to just because it is unconventional does not make it any less. In fact, even adoptive parents or unconventional parents who rub society the wrong way with their unconventional raising may be just as good or even better than the conventional two-parent household.
I was one of those kids raised in an unconventional way due to my parents' immigration from another country. They had to give up so much just to give their children a better life. And my appreciation to them has grown even more after having watched this movie. I know now that I must do more to show them that I appreciate what they did for me. I did not understand it at the time when I was growing up as I did without a lot of things that other children took for granted such as toys and even the access to cable tv. But now I know, I was rich in a different way.
This movie delves into a lot of deep matter that is not present in many blockbuster movies that we have nowadays. To compare them to this movie is like comparing fast food to a home-cooked meal that has been prepared with a lot of love. This movie is in the latter and most movies today such as Transformers is strictly visceral entertainment. Like a fast food meal, it does the job. But it lacks substance. There are so many things covered in this movie but I will leave that to you as each person comes away with a different take on what the director and writer may have had in mind. And so my review is a personal one which will be different for all others. All I am saying is that you should watch this movie. You will come away spiritually richer for it.
As for entertainment, this movie packs it in. I have never seen a movie that was so full entertainment that I caught my attention for the entire movie. You will not be bored for a moment. The comedy, along with slapstick, will leave you laughing throughout. I have never been so happy while watching a movie. And there will be twists. And the twist will not be thrown in there just to be there. But there will be good reason for the twist. This movie is so intelligently made that it all comes together perfectly.
After having watched this movie, my perspectives have changed a whole lot. Even with my feelings about my friends' sister who mocked her adoptive parents. My perspective of my parents have changed a great deal and thanks to this movie I have a more intelligent way of thinking about how they raised me and how much they must have loved me to sacrifice so much.
I shall not wander too much with this review. I shall just encourage you to watch it for what its worth, a magical funny movie that trumps many heavy Oscar-nominated big blockbuster movies. It's even got a Johnny Depp look-alike playing as Johnny Depp. How much funnier is that? Go see it. You can thank me later.",1399420800,3,5022,4.2974683544303796

Plunked the DVD in the player, hit 'play', and was surprised that only one sentence was in English.  It was a sub-titled movie in Spanish.  Well, it just wasn't what I was expecting...it's more than likely my error for not fully reading the description, if the description states that the movie has English sub titles.  I didn't want to read the movie - I have books for that.  I wanted to sit back and be entertained, hopefully cheered up.  I hit 'stop' after a few minutes...wasn't what I was looking for.

6080382,5,B00GJNQ3S0,Wasn't sure what to expect with this - thought maybe it would be stupid funny at best but it was a pleasant surprise.  It was pretty funny at the beginning and then sweet and even heartbreaking towards the end. At the beginning he is very irresponsible with the baby who is literally handed off to him so there are some scary scenes if you're a mom whose faint of heart.  A nice story of how a child can change your life even if it's the last thing you wanted.  I've seen a lot of duds lately so it was a nice change of pace.  I did have problems with 2 library copies where the subtitles were very intermittent despite ongoing dialogue and when they did pop up they were half sentences.  I finally turned the closed captioning on and that worked well.  Not sure if that's an isolated problem or not.,1395705600,,800,4.264900662251655

It is so well done that I've not talked to anyone who wasn't surprised as the plot unfolded.  What starts on the beaches of Acapulco  (haven't we ALL been there??)  slowly turns into a story that touches your heart, and sometimes breaks it. Even though it's in Spanish, and many people had to rely on the subtiles, it was held over at our local theater because the crowd grew.

6080440,5,B00GJNQ3S0,I normally don't review movies but want to back this one. I was disappointed when it became evident I was going to have to read subtitles for the duration of the movie. I normally get at least the gist of a movie before I invest the time and if I had I would have opted out. Thank goodness I was bored enough just to pick something and did not follow suit here. Love love love this movie.  Laugh until you snort. Cry until you can't see. Then laugh again (be sure and watch through the credits). Highly recommended as there is true character development for this film which seems to be a lost art.,1392940800,2,597,4.2368421052631575

It was interesting to see him work outside his normal comedy environment.  As a comedian I think he is the best!!!  He is very creative.  I could see how he gave this movie his personal flavor, but still kept the character in check to not show too much of that crazy side of him which made the movie be more than a comedy.  It was funny, but it had more to it.",1391385600,2,464,3.882978723404255
6080483,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"Instructions Not Included cost about $6 million to make and grossed over $90 million internationally at the box office which makes it a huge hit.

That astonishing statistic was enough to get me to watch this movie, and I am so glad I did because it is one of the best movies of last year, and one of the most amusing and emotionally touching movies I have seen in some time.

For one thing it's hard to believe it only cost $6 million to make because it looks as good, and is as professionally well made as movies costing several times that amount.

Set variously in Acapulco and Beverly Hills, it relates a well developed three dimensional story of a man named Valentin who leads a carefree irresponsible life in Acapulco, as a local lothario mostly occupied with seducing more than his fair share of the many beautiful women who populate and visit Acapulco. His carefree life is turned upside down when one of his former loves turns up and he is left holding a small living breathing responsibility. Like many of us he has fears and insecurities, his fears amusingly represented by a dark four legged creature. At the beginning he is selfish. If you're like me you will wonder if his heart is big enough for what it is required to do.

Circumstances sent him on a quest to Hollywood way outside his usual comfort zone, and he manages to luck into the movie business, in a job which tests his insecurities and this is where this becomes a rather beautiful story, with many unexpected twists and turns, very endearing.

The two main actresses in the movie do an amazing job. The former lover played by Jessica Lindsey has tremendous poise, presence and beauty, and the young actress Loreto Peralta plays the girl without affectation, speaks in two languages and has great chemistry with Valentin. Eugenio Derbio who plays Valentin does a rather spectacular job in this movie wearing the multiple hats of director and lead actor, and delivers a movie which one has to admit is developed from a great story, and emotionally this story is pitch perfect.

The one caveat about this movie is that it may not be suitable for young children, a matter for your personal discretion. Much of the movie is subtitled, and even though Spanish is not among my languages this did not present any obstacle to my enjoyment as the movie unfolds in such a visual conveying as much if not more with facial expressions and gestures rather than words.

I think most people will enjoy this movie, and I hope this was helpful.",1391299200,3,2503,4.636568848758465

It's a beautiful story and made me wonder if I'm ever going to have a daughter or a son in my life.  :(
Hachi is the only movie that I won't watch again because I tear up badly and this is the movie that I would watch again because of the storyline being so shocking at the end. :(",1391299200,6,570,3.9565217391304346

6080490,4,B00GJNQ3S0,"I've seen Eugenio Derbez in plenty of Mexican TV shows as an actor or director and he has a talent for both. The movie starts out pretty slow and some of the jokes are kind of corny. It starts to pick up about 20 minutes or so onward. Most of the acting in the film is average, but Derbez should be praised for directing and co-writing. There is a lot symbolism in the movie that is very smartly placed throughout the movie.

The real standout in the film is Loreto Peralta (Maggie), who Derbez discovered through Twitter! She is fluent in Spanish and English and her transition between the two languages (even within the same scenes) is flawless. This is her first acting role and everything about her performance is seamless and believable. She and Derbez are humorous and charming, and Peralta handles the more emotional scenes excellently. I have a feeling we'll certainly be seeing more of her in both American and Mexican projects. The ending is very touching and surprising, so don't be tempted to read spoilers. Visually, there's nothing spectacular about it, but emotionally, there's a lot more substance to the plot than what the trailer shows! 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1391212800,2,1174,4.726829268292683

I wasn't sure about this movie when I first rented it, mainly because I wasn't sure how well the story and the comedy would translate to me, since I am not fluent in Spanish.  I have watched foreign films before in a variety of languages but this is my first attempt at watching a foreign comedy movie.  But you know my fears of that were unfounded, there were some funny moment for sure but more than that the movie is more of a heartfelt comedy with a big heart at that.  This movie starts a bit slowly and is less of a laugh out loud funny movie and is more of a pull at your heart strings story.  This movie has a lot of drama and a surprise ending that will leave you in tears, you won't even have to speak Spanish to get this movie.  If you have never tried watching a foreign film, give this one a chance, it has a story that is worth it.",1391212800,8,1075,4.139423076923077

Could not get over that.

6080496,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"We expected this to be funny, and it was.  We knew it was a Spanish language film, however nearly 25% of the film is in English.  It was a true bi-lingual experience.  Not at all hard to follow for non-spanish speakers.  The subtitles are very easy to follow.

This movie does an excellent job setting one up for a genuinely unexpected ending.  The bilingual Maggie will likely steal your heart with her natural charm.

You'll have a hard time not laughing, however you may want to have a tissue or two in the vicinity.  The film deals largely with a Mother abandoning her infant child, but Eugenio masterfully doesn't allow one to lose sight if this, but makes the most of it through comedy, and heart.

Particularly great about this purchase is the fact that the DVD comes with an Ultraviolet option.  We were able to add this film to our Vudu-Ultraviolet account, and it's another way to watch the film at no additional charge.",1391126400,3,930,4.581818181818182

After watching this movie I can honestly say the apple did not fall far from the tree and you can add me to being a huge fan of Eugenio now.  This movie showcases the life of Valentin Bravo (Derbez) from a young boy of 6 or 7 years and his misunderstood relationship with his father and how he grows with this unreasonable fear and getting to find himself as a father himself unwilling or otherwise, he takes on the responsibility and steps up to the plate with a corky understanding of life and how to raise a child with lots of twists and turns.  I won't go into more details because I truly hope that everyone will give this wonderful heartfelt movie a chance.

6080532,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"Well, I rented this movie with the expectation of kicking back and having a few laughs, assuming it was going to be a light, funny comedy. Not even close. It turned out to be one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen thousands of movies in my 60+ years.
The beginning does indeed start out silly. In fact, so silly, that I began to wonder if I would even bother to finish it. So glad I decided to stay with it. A lot of movies start out strong and fizzle along the way. This movie does just the opposite. It starts out weak, and just keeps getting stronger - and stronger - and stronger. And, just when you think you have things figured out, you realize that you don't - not even close.
This is definitely one that I want to watch over and over and over, and lend to all of my family members and friends to watch, so I just placed my order for it on this website a moment ago.",1390521600,50,911,4.010989010989011

The choice of English or Spanish is for the subtitles (Choose English, youll see subtitles for the Spanish, and Vice Versa)  I know just a little Spanish so I left the Subtitles on.  This movie has Laughs, is a light cliffhanger a Drama and Most importantly, it has a heart.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and now think its in my top 20 of all time. I watch between 200-250 movies a year and Loved this more than 99% I saw this year.

I went along to see it again.
My brother and his wife loved the movie as well.  I took my best friend Jessica and she loved it even though she was crying through parts of it.

It's sad that this did not even get nominated for the Oscars.  I can tell you 2 movies that are nominated were not as good as this movie.  Movie politics.  What can you do?

6080547,3,B00GJNQ3S0,"Engaging, warm-hearted film with subtitles that breathes a little new life into the parenthood/PG-13 family movie genre.

Derbez is Valentn, an Acapulco playboy whose life is literally transformed when a baby, his baby, suddenly appears on his doorstep. Valentin unsuccessfully tries to return the baby, following her tourist mother, Julie, back to the United States.

The story picks up in L.A. when the baby Maggie, now 6, is living with her devoted and story-telling but clueless single father Valentin, who has become a much, much less-than-fearless Hollywood stuntman.

All is going well in a quirky, offbeat fun way, until Maggie's mother Julie makes an appearance again and things take a serious but well-balanced turn.

In all, some of the characters and comedy are over-the-top in a good way, and it gets a little tear-jerky towards the end, but there are many unexpectedly welcome twists and turns to offset that. The family chemistry between father and daughter and Valentin's unshakable devotion and optimism is sure to charm, while never shying away from the tougher issues of a daughter raised by a single parent.

A surprising and delightful film that is worth a look.",1389225600,5,1183,5.140625

To my dismay it was nothing of the sort, and turned out to be a movie that was filmed between L.A. and Acapulco (Mexico). This film is incredible and I only wish that I would have seen it when it came out and not at the dollar theater (in order to support movies of this caliber that may lack the funding). The previous day (early january 2014), I had seen a number three box office film costing 19.00USD for two tickets. Needless to say, this movie which I saw the day after, costed me 6 USD for three tickets and completely made up for the cr@p I had seen the day before, and the many months before that. Thank you Eugenio Derbez, and Loreto Peralta, for making my outing back in El Paso, TX one that was memorable for my future wife, my mother, and I. Best film in a long time.

6080550,5,B00GJNQ3S0,"""No se Aceptan Devoluciones"" (English captions) is rapidly becoming a phenomenon: By its second week, it is currently the tenth highest-grossing foreign film in U.S. history and on track for third place.(NOTE: By December, 2013, this has become the highest-grossing Spanish language film in American history.)

Directed by Mexican superstar Eugenio Derbez, who also co-wrote the screenplay, this hits all its marks: It's heart-warming, funny, and has an adorable little girl as the central issue. This has been a labor of love for Mr. Derbez: It took him twelve long years to raise the money to create this film and distribute it in los Estados Unidos.

Please enjoy:
  * Eugenio Derbez (""Under the Same Moon"") is a happy playboy in Acapulco when a former fling dumps their baby girl in his lap; he didn't know she was pregnant, nor did he know how to change a diaper. Six years later, after struggling to pay the bills, he has become a top stuntman in Hollywood. You'll smile at their father/ daughter pajamas; in fact you'll think perhaps he is a bit too indulgent.
  * Loreto Peralto in her film debut, is the surprise package. She has become her father's on-set coach and taught him how to be a worthwhile adult, even as he has supported and loved her. Listen to her switch between Spanish and English as she negotiates his pay raises.
  * Jessica Lindsey (""Now You See Me"") resurfaces and jeopardizes the life our hero has built with his wise and much-loved daughter. There are a few surprises with her, too.

Everything in this sweet but salty personal project is painted with broad strokes, there is NO subtlety here. Our hero's fears are represented by wolves, whether it's his fear of commitment or fear of heights, he sees wolves! Problem is, the pleasure of watching these characters lulls you into a false sense of superiority, then the story sneaks up on your blind side.

Find a theater in your area where you can see this one...please.

I WILL own this DVD (I pre-ordered it from Amazon and recommended it to my JayFlix.net folks)!",1387929600,18,2046,4.767705382436261

The child actress was perfect for the role and Derbez proved that he can do both drama and comedy. The movie was well made, well written, and the actors were all wonderful. I watched this movie at the theater and I finally felt there was a movie I could take my parents to. They both speak primarily Spanish and although they do speak English, they prefer to watch full films in Spanish. I was very glad this movie came out and we made it a family event to go see it.
