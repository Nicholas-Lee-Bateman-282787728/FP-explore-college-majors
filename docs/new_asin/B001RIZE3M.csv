3776300,5,B001RIZE3M,"I am so glad that these films are getting a re-release.  I also think they should be released in these editions individually, for people who want one of the films, or doesn't want a box set or slim pack.  I, for one, went out and bought TMNT 1 & 2 earlier this year, and searched and searched for TMNT 3 forever before I realized that the third Turtles movie only comes in the 3-Pak and good luck trying to find it individually because stores don't have it.  So I wasted my money on the first two movies, and was gonna trade them in for like 0.50 cents each and buy the 3-pak until I heard about this a few months ago.  I am ecstatic.  I sincerely hope there's special features cuz the original releases had no extras!  This will be a cool box set, cool DVD design too!",1249689600,,769,4.162162162162162
3776301,5,B001RIZE3M,"I just had my entire childhood rush back to me. I've been waiting so long for the turtles to come to Blu-ray, and now it's finally happening! TURTLE POWER!!",1248566400,3,156,4.413793103448276
3776302,4,B001RIZE3M,"I'm absolutely thrilled that the original live-action&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TMNT-1990/dp/6304698739/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TMNT (1990)</a>&nbsp;movie is being offered on Blu-Ray. I'm extremely disappointed that I have to buy this box set in order to get the original TMNT movie. The upset comes from the fact that the movies, other than the CGI&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TMNT-2007/dp/B000R34V50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TMNT (2007)</a>, are not available separately from the box set.

PROS:
 + Able to get the original TMNT (1990) movie on Blu-Ray
 + If you like all four movies, this is a great deal
 + Bonus features are plentiful

CONS:
 - Original TMNT (1990) not available to buy separately
 - Forced to buy the other three if you don't like them
 - If you already own the TMNT (2007), you'll have a duplicate

In my opinion,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TMNT2-Secret-of-the-Ooze/dp/B0000696I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TMNT2: Secret of the Ooze</a>&nbsp;was too cheesy of a sequel compared to the surprisingly dark and violent original movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TMNT3-Turtles-in-Time/dp/B0000696I1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TMNT3: Turtles in Time</a>&nbsp;left a bad taste in all fans' mouth due to it not having anything to do with the arcade game of the same name. In fact, TMNT3 doesn't have any TMNT regular villains; rather it sends the Turtles back to feudal Japan (which isn't a bad storyline but it could have been its own movie without the Turtles).

And finally, I felt the TMNT (2007) CGI film was absolute garbage. Not only for screwing up the Karai ""City at War"" storyline badly, but also for having terrible-looking CGI rather than using live actors and puppets/suits of the original three films, which looked infinitely better. You gotta wonder why special effects looked better in the 1990s rather than in modern times. I blame laziness and CGI (CGI is much easier to pull off than real special effects, and can be easily off-shored). Though, it still doesn't look as bad as Robert Zemeckis's terrible CGI garbage films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beowulf/dp/B001AII4RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beowulf</a>&nbsp;and the upcoming A Christmas Carol. I feel this movie just doesn't belong in this set, as you can buy it separately, and it was done by completely different writers and special effects people than the 1990s live-action films.

The original three movies were done by the Jim Henson ""Creature Shop"" (Jim was even alive for the first movie) which means the effects were absolutely brilliant and light-years ahead of even today's CGI. If you're too young to have experienced this when it was first released, go watch the first three films immediately. And also, be sure to catch Jim Henson's other special effects masterpieces such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Labyrinth/dp/B0016BPWNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Labyrinth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Crystal/dp/B0016BWACI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Crystal</a>&nbsp;(skip&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirrormask/dp/B001DJLCPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirrormask</a>).

I can understand that collectors would want all four movies. I can understand that, separately, TMNT2: Secret of the Ooze and TMNT3: Turtles in Time are not popular enough to warrant separate Blu-Ray releases. But I believe the original TMNT (1990) is popular and a classic enough to warrant its own stand-alone Blu-Ray release.

I'll probably buy this set just to have TMNT (1990) but I'd prefer a stand-alone release. If a stand-alone were ever release, I'd be selling my box set copy on Amazon Marketplace.",1248134400,8,3999,6.756809338521401

3776317,4,B001RIZE3M,"Got the bare bones 4 movie set, and I must say the first is still the best, and the CGI movie is also good. Parts 2 and 3 are bad. All of these movies are schlock, grabbing the money of kids (now nostalgic grown-ups). While the CGI of the two new Michael Bay films is decent, there's no stopping the first movie. In all honesty, even as a kid, the best incarnation of the Ninja Turtles was still for me embodied in the first two arcade games (not the ports of those games, the originals). Rarely did we ever get what we really wanted, which was all out fighting between the Turtles and their enemies, Shredder and his Foot Clan, holding nothing back (and four people each controlling one of the pizza chomping ninja heroes). This is comedic action, but it gets less serious and more slapstick with each installment (until the first CGI flick in this set). For the price, it's worth it to see the others if you are curious, but again IMHO, the bookends to the set are worth the price of admission. So many DVD sets are like this now.. one or two good movies packed in with some real clunkers. Now when it comes to cartoon shows, the original was unique, but the 2003 cartoon was really great.

Quality guaranteed! In original artwork/packaging unless otherwise noted."" the words included ""original art/packaging"" which i believed and was under the impression that this was the completed collectors package. Including the art work cards and all. All i got was four discs and the box .Nothing else. It showed the complete collection with hat and all in the pictures. I attached a picture of what i got and what i was shown . Missing some items id say. I feel like i was mislead on what i was paying for. I paid 126 dollars Canadian total plus on top of that i got charged another 25 dollars custom fees as well. Item was four day late as per  what was stated on the estimate to add to that. I can some what forgive that part as once it leaves it is out of the sellers control to a certain extent. So after all this in total i paid 150 dollars for just the box and four discs. I don't like that at all. I am kind of angry about this experience as i felt like i didn't get what i was lead to believe i was buying in the description and pictures. UPDATE- Wonder book has been in contact with me in regards to this order and I can happily state we have come to a fair solution to this purchase. They were courteous and attentive to what i had to say as i was to them. Constructive calm conversation has produced a fair result.and in the end i am happy with the solution .

TMNT movie, which looks great, but who cares about that crappy movie?)I have no problem with film grain, but these movies still have that blur to them. I don't think they put full effort and financing into remastering these movies in hd, because I've seen much older films look much better on blu-ray. You do get an awesome pizza box set and some cool TMNT cards and beanie, but those just a nice bonuses.
I suggest buying the newline 4 dvd pack which is probably like 8 bucks or less. They are widescreen, and upscaled look pretty much as good.",1440028800,,690,4.484126984126984

I used to have the disks individually, so I got rid of those, and replaced them with this. It saves space, and its perfect. The disk quality could have been batter, but I can still watch them, so it doesn't really matter.
I was a little disappointed though, it didn't come with any scene selection inserts, or any kind of inserts at all like the individual DVDs came with, only a paper for a Vudu/Ultraviolet Digital copy of the first movie....which if fine I guess if you're into that sort of thing....
Other than that, I have no complaints. This was a great buy, and I highly recommend it if you enjoy the original movies. F.Y.I, the DVD version and Blu-Ray versions are exactly the same in picture quality, so you're probably better off just buying the DVD version and spending less....",1429660800,,883,4.594936708860759

The fourth and I use that term loosely although considered a fourth installment to the tmnt collection I disagree. The movie by itself was awesome however compare that to the 3 early 90's films and you have 2 different animals. The 17 year gap from the originally start to the 2007 animated one is not to be compared. The 90's used people in costumes and puppetry and it worked well. I would of loved to see the fourth installment just like those 3 but the era of new technology is among us and it's just not the same. They should of started a new chapter for the 2007 movie for a new generation,1426723200,,690,4.2748091603053435

This is a very cheap Blu-ray set. The discs are just reprints of the past Blu-ray collection, but the discs are clear and have no artwork. The films on the other hand look decent. The original TMNT trilogy won't ever look brilliant, but the video and audio quality is still very good. TMNT (2007) is also good looking and sounding.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Movie (3.5/5)
I personally think this is still a good movie. The turtle costumes are great and there's a nice tone going on with this movie. The story is actually still plausible and the action scenes are well done. The best a Ninja Turtles movie can ever get. The picture quality is average, but good. So is the audio, but there are no special features aside from the theatrical trailer.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (3/5)
After the first film was a box office hit, the sequel went into production almost immediately. However, parents complained about the violence in the first film, so Ninja Turtles II is more kid friendly. The movie is not that good, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. The turtles still look great, it's bright and colorful(in a good way), and there's that dumb but fun Vanilla Ice bit. The picture quality is average, but good. So is the audio, but there are no special features aside from the theatrical trailer.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1.5/5)
This movie is not very good. The script is terrible, the turtle costumes are not very good and it is just a disappointing closure to the series... The picture quality is average, but good. So is the audio, but there are no special features aside from the theatrical trailer.
Video - 3/5

One thing that bugs me is that the film has the subtitle ""Turtles in Time"" on the cover and the disc. In the actual movie, there is no subtitle, it's just simply ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III"". ""Turtles in Time"" is the name of the SNES/Arcade game from 1991. Who's the schmuck-head who gave it the subtitle ""Turtles in Time""?
It would've been better off calling it ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: No Refunds"".

TMNT (3.5/5)
The story is a bit confusing, and I'm not quite sure if it follows the past movies or the 2003 cartoon. Probably the latter. The animation is decent and well done. The voice actors get their job done and it is a very entertaining film. The picture quality is quite good and the audio is great. Unlike the 90's trilogy, it has actual special features: A director's commentary, deleted scenes, an Alternate Opening/Ending, Storyboard-to-CGI Comparison, and more.

3776542,3,B001RIZE3M,"If you have never seen the movies before, this is the cheapest and easiest way to acquire all 4 movies. It only got 3 stars from me though because I was disappointed in the case and the lack of any designs on the discs.

The area where the discs are held is just very tall. So all 4 discs sit on top of each other. Allowing the graphics on the DVD below it to scratch the DVD above it if the case is moved a lot. The other reason I am a little disappointed is because each DISC has a basic black label stating what the movie is. No designs, nothing special. I assume this is how they make the set so cheap though.

For hardcore turtle fans, I would spend a bit more money to get the movies in better quality. For someone who just wants to get the movies for some kids to watch or for someone who has never seen them, can't been $8 + Prime Shipping",1420588800,2,847,3.976470588235294

Pizza Box, with Pizza Discs, comic book of the first movie, character cards, a sketch, and a hoodie!!
My only complain is that this was a limited time buy. I had to buy it used.
Don't know if its because the person that I bought it from didn't take care of his stuff, or if it was designed to do this, but the bottom of the box I have has a circle stain/mark type of thing. Maybe its intentional to look like pizza grease. But like I said, I bought it used. So I can't tell for sure.

Donatello being the only successful one working as a CEO of some big corporate enterprise where he has made a living selling the machines he always invented? Poor splinter after the turtles had grown up and split way they dump him at an old folks home? Some terrible force could bring them out of retirement for one last showdown to save earth.

3776880,5,B001RIZE3M,"I previously owned all of the Ninja Turtle movies on DVD, but I decided I would go ahead and finally convert them to Blu-Ray because for one, the movies are all upgrade worthy...two, I have been converting much of my DVD collection to Blu-Ray anyway...three, I love cool sets, and four, I hated the DVD case my original Ninja Turtles movie was in (you know...those annoying taller cases with those latches on them that make it complicating to put other DVDs in next to) and I had dual discs (the TMNT DVD was a dual disc and I hate those).  LOL, yes...I am a tad knit picky when it comes to my movies.

Anyway, this 25th anniversary edition set has become a collector's item and people are selling it for absurd amounts now...I think the lowest new price I'd seen for it was like $100.00.  I had been wanting the set for a while but had not been able to yet, but my wife told me to go ahead and get it as a Christmas gift, (and ironically it showed up on Christmas Eve).  I couldn't spent no $100+ on it though, but I happened to find a used one in decent shape for $50.  Upon receiving it, I looked over the packaging, discs, and collectibles and I was uber excited!  Those first 3 movies were childhood favorites of mine and I very much enjoyed TMNT too, and just having those all together in a cool set like this was just amazing.  Even if I started converting some things to a future format, I seriously doubt I'd ever sell this set unless I absolutely needed too financially, because I love everything about Blu-Ray anyway and this set is just awesome!

Firstly, the packaging...super cool!  The case is designed to look like a pizza box, and it even has a makeshift grease spot on the back much like a pizza box would.  The discs are all made up to look like pizzas, which I thought was pretty clever.  The collectible cards and the collectible artwork are all really cool, and I like the collectible comic a lot too...all cool stuff.  The only thing about mine was that the plush beanie was not included in it, and the seller was up front about that, but in all honesty I wasn't as concerned with the beanie...I mainly wanted the discs and the other collectibles.  If you're a fan of the Ninja Turtles movies, if you can manage it, you really ought to try and acquire this set!  It's super awesome!

As for the movies, well...as I mentioned above, the original 3 are childhood favorites.  Ninja Turtles is simply one of my favorite things, and I use to watch the original cartoon show as well.  It's almost a shame that a handful of the original episodes wasn't included in this set, but not a big deal...I own a few of the volumes anyway.  TMNT obviously came along later on down the line, but it was quite enjoyable itself...I'd honestly wished they'd made a trilogy from that one but I'll take it as is.  Here are my individual ratings for each film:

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: 5/5

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II Secret of the Ooze: 5/5

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III Turtles In Time: 4/5

TMNT: 4/5

Again, if you are as big a fan of the Ninja Turtles movies as I am, definitely try and get your hands on this set.  I have not looked at any features yet in this set, but I've never been a real big feature kinda guy anyway...only occasionally do I watch any features.  I'm really more about the movies, and these make great marathon material.  These are great movies that I love love love, and I'm super stoked to have this set!",1357862400,,3448,4.388976377952756

There is a much cheaper set that includes just the original three movies, but this one has the CGI one too which is preferable to me. One thing I would warn is that while the pizza box concept is neat, it takes up way too much space on your shelf and is pretty fragile.

So, at the beginning of this year I was struck by the TMNT bug once again. I purchased a TMNT backpack, and I purchased these movies as well. It was glorious. I was a bit hesitant to buy this set because I had heard that the quality of the movies was a little lacking, but in the end I relented and bought it anyways. As soon as I started the first movie, I was very impressed. It's not like it has uncanny clarity like say the Lord of the Rings or other big budget movies on blu-ray, but that's the thing. These movies were low-budget movies produced in the 90's. Of course the quality is going to be a little lacking. Another thing to remember is that these movies probably don't have a huge following, so WB is probably not too keen on spending money on remastering these movies. The transfer that was made, however, is pretty good. These movies have never looked this good. Obviously, the first one is the one that looks the most grainy and even then it doesn't look like an upscaled DVD transfer. My biggest gripe is the lack of special features. I am hoping that a later set is released that does justice to the series. But, for now, this set will do. The packaging is cute. It resembles a pizza box and every blu-ray is supposed to be a different type of pizza. The packaging is a little cheap (it's made out of cardboard, like a pizza box), but if you take good care of your products it shouldn't be a big deal. Included with the set is a beanie, a comic book, and some other things that resemble big baseball cards. In the end, I'm very glad I purchased this set. It was worth every penny and I'm glad I got to view these movies once again.",1335398400,,1855,4.213483146067416

The one thing I didn't like was the ""signed"" drawing included which the drawing was cool but the signature was clearly a print job so that was kinda lame.

we all know the extra features suck in that there are basically none. you'd think that a 25th anniversary special edition blu-ray set would have something but sadly, no. maybe some day we'll get something at least for the original movie.

the goodies packed in are pretty cool. the mini comic is nicely done. it's a reissue of the original #1 classic. the beanie is basic but cool. my biggest complaint is that the character cards that are packed in all feature pictures of the turtles from the third movie. this makes no sense. why would you use pictures of them from the movie in which they looked the worst? i don't know but it's more turtle collectibles so i'm for it.

lastly, the high def transfer is nothing to write home about. the newer cgi film looks amazing but while watching the others i actually ejected the disc to check and make sure it was a blu ray and not a dvd.

anyway, it's the turtles, so i love it. some more features would be welcomed but i believe it will happen one day. also, the pizza box packaging is a nice touch.",1319500800,2,1307,4.366255144032922

3776955,4,B001RIZE3M,"I think almost everyone loves Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The TMNT are cool and funny. Now people get to own the TMNT movies on Blu-ray in one set. These movies do look and sound better than the DVD versions. One thing is in the first movie I still saw some grainy textures in some scenes. Which is kind of disapointing because I expected more out of a HD transfer. I also noticed that some of the colors in scenes were changed a little too. In the first movie where the sewer scenes are shown the surrounding is supposed to be more orangish, on the BD one it looks kind of like a regular place. I don't know if they changed it because they didn't like it or maybe that's how the movie supposed to look like. Too bad there isn't any special features for the first 3 films. If there was this collection would be much better. People also get a comic book, sketch, and character cards too. If you loved all the TMNT movies then you have to buy this collection.

How can you not love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? If you grew up in the 90's, you probably had the video games, the action figures, owned the music and watched the cartoon after school and of course went to the movies. As a child of the 80's I missed out on most of the Turtle hype as they hit their popularity peak in the mid-90's, a bit past my time. But as a lover cheesy bad movies, it wasn't long before I discovered these films and put them into regular rotation at my house.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" - The original is still tons of fun. The titular turtles have to stop Shredder and the Foot Clan from taking over New York City, and turning the city's kids into karate kickin' thugs. We get the complete backstory on all of the characters, and there are some fun fight scenes sprinkled throughout.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze"" - The first sequel may still be the most over-the-top film in the series, but remains my personal favorite. A large chemical company is cleaning up an old chemical dumping ground, when a canister of the ooze that created our heroes is stolen by Shredder and the remnants of his Foot Clan. Shedder wastes no time in using the ooze to create his own monsters to destory the turtles. Love the Vanilla Ice tune featured during the showdown at the end, yes it's corny and dated, but I guarantee you'll be singing the thing all day.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III"" - The series jumps in a completely different direction with this entry. Instead of fighting Shredder and the Foot Clan, the turtles find themselves sent back to 17th Century Feudal Japan and into the middle of a budding war. This is a fun entry, and of the original three films, I think this one really hits the mark comedy-wise.

""TMNT"" - This was a cartoon movie done just a few years ago, and while it's a nice ""extra"", it's not the reason to own this disk.

These movies are quite a bit of fun. I see some other people talking about the quality issues of the film. All I can say is that each film gave me the option of watching in widescreen or pan & scan, and the picture quality as well as the sound were great.

I understand there are plans to ""re-make"" (or is the current term ""re-imagine""?) the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into a whole new film. I'm sure that if/when this happens, we'll get a CGI version of the turtles similar to what they did to Scooby-Doo and it won't be nearly as good. Grab this disk while you can, pop in these movies and enjoy with noshing on a large pizza, cause trust me, after watching the turtles munch on pizza through three 90 minute films, you will definately want some too!",1314662400,,2781,4.388349514563107

quality:  the blu ray does enhance the image especially in turtles 3,  the turtles look really sharp and you can see the scale on their skin, seems like the turtles got a lot of work in this one, but not necessarily the people in the movie. the people in the movie quality is not as good as the turtles. as for the first and second ones, their is an increase from their dvd counter parts,  nice widescreen view, a bit more detailed than the dvds. nothing super spectacular but it works, turtles 1 & 2 video quality 4/5 turtles 3 4.5/5 , tmnt, video qualit 4.7/5. i must dock off points for the tmnt blu ray realese. what is up with developers releasing BLU RAYS IN LETTERBOX(black bars above and below) , shouldnt blu ray always be  non letterboxed,  most people that have widescreen tvs want their widescreen no black bars. its acceptable for a dvd but not a blu ray. lots of pixels are bing taken away, so tmnt i would say is not technically 1080p; however, the quality of the film is still good and is obviously the best quality of the 4 in terms of picture. the first 3 should fill your wide screen tv perfectly.

4.5/5 video quality

extra content : sorry turtle fans you won't be seeing any  cut scenes from the original movies. disappointing. basically its just the movies in the first 3 and in tmnt 4 bascially the dvd content.

1.5/ 5

collectors value : beanie comic bool, pizza like box,  cards and the blu rays. only negative here, is that the blu rays are stacked together i personally prefer them with a different case

sound quality : good and clear 5/5

3776962,4,B001RIZE3M,"I remember laughing when I heard the name Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the age of 8! It sounded silly. I watched the animated cartoon and found it entertaining. The ""Ninja Turtles"" were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird and the ""heroes in a half shell"" have been around since 1984. I remember when stores were flooded with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle merchandise. The Ninja Turtle Pies, as the Nostalgia Critic claims, made the slogan ""fresh from the sewer"" sound yummy!
The Ninja Turtles also love to eat a staple diet of pizza. The anthromoporphic Ninja Turtles are named after Renaissance painters, fight bad guys, and sound like surfers. This DVD-18 is a compilation of Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael's cinematic adventures. Their master is a giant rat that knows Japanese martial arts. Vigilante Casey Jones and news reporter April O' Neil are their friends. The Shredder and the Foot Clan are iconic villains.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(1990): Good timing and visionary producers helped craft this first live action TMNT movie. Music video director Steve Barron gives a gritty, real world feel to the Ninja Turtles' larger-than-life adventures. Movie critics complained about the silly dialouge and the product placement. Parents complained about the ""violence and profanity"". The Ninja Turtle costumes designed by Jim Henson Studios look great! They help sell the illusion. Elias Koteas and lovely Judith Hoag give earnest performances as Casey Jones and April O' Neil. John Du Prez's TMNT music score is catchy and energetic.
The Ninja Turtles battle a crime wave caused by The Foot Clan.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze(1991): The producers toned down the ""curse words and the violence"" and raised the humor. This Ninja Turtles movie is closer in spirit to the comic book style animated TMNT series. Michael Pressman directs this time around and sensual Paige Turco replaces Judith Hoag as April O' Neil. Casey Jones' absence is filled in by martial artist-actor Ernie Reyes Jr. The Ninja Turtles still battle another crime wave caused by The Shredder. The Shredder fights ""fire with fire"" by using a mutant dog and a snapping turtle(Tokah and Razar). Rap singer Vanilla Ice makes a cameo appearance in a night club.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III(1993): This is considered the weakest TMNT movie. It's not as bad as the TMNT: Coming Out of Our Shells Tour or the VHS special We Wish You a Turtle Christmas. The animatronics aren't as good this time around and there's too many stale gags. The Ninja Turtles travel to 17th Century Japan to rescue April O' Neil after a lord labels her a witch. The Ninja Turtles also fight a stereotypical English bad guy. Stuart Gillard directs this one. There's a lot of references to Wayne's World and The Addams Family. Lovely Vivian Wu plays a Japanese female warrior.

TMNT(2007): This CGI-driven Ninja Turtles movie keeps the campy humor to a minimum and goes for plot and character depth. Laurence Fishburne(The Matrix, Othello) narrates over the first scene as the Ninja Turtles hop from rooftop to rooftop.
Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael are getting older and struggling to stay together. They have to battle immortal warriors from Asia, a wealthy guy(voiced by Patrick Stewart), and what is left of The Foot Clan. The CGI is good looking at times and the film has some good moments.

The voice actors in those two are my favorite. I didn't like the ones in the 3rd movie, but the scenery in that is worth buying it alone. The blu-ray really brings out the green in the Japanese forests. Not to mention Donatello was voiced by Corey Feldman which I didn't know. And I surprisingly like the 4th one even though it's computer animated. I think it's another great one to have on blu-ray BECAUSE it's computer animated. And also Raph's voice in this one was better than in the 3rd and it also did more justice to the characters than the 3rd one did. I've been a Turtle fan since I was a kid.

Secondly, the special feature on the first three only contained a trailer, which I was a little disappointing about. I thought Warner Bros could have gotten some of the cast and crew for some retrospective interviews about the films. The animated film had some interesting unseen footage and a few small interview clips.
And lastly about the packaging of the collector edition. It's a very neat little package in the form of a pizza box. But with all pizza boxes, it can be hard to close without bending the cardboard. The collectors comic and postcards are interesting to read.

3776979,5,B001RIZE3M,"If you're a fan of the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" films, this Blu-ray set is extremely, highly recommended. Me, I would have been fine having the first film separately, but the two live-action sequels ARE relics of my past, and ones I like to dabble in every few years or so, so the fact that all the movies are bundled together isn't a huge problem for me. Plus, I kinda like that pizza box cardboard case and the goodies inside, which include:

*a mini reprinting of the full Mirage Studios 62-page black and white comic adaptation of the first film made by TMNT co-creators Peter Laird (script) and Kevin Eastman (layouts) who also ink--along with the very talented Eric Talbot--the exceptional pencils by Jim Lawson
*a black beanie with the old school cartoon and movie Ninja Turtles logo printed on the front
*an envelope with a cool drawing of the Turtles on front, the contents inside being some pretty neat character cards, but the coolest item being a small reproduction of a drawing penciled and signed by Peter Laird

But the biggest aspects of this Blu-ray set to get excited about are the quality transfers of the films, the main reason for buying a Blu-ray Disc. All four films are recreated accurately in the digital medium with a great level of grain and detail on the first three films, and an understandably sharp, grain-free image for the CGI film.

From now on I'll only focus on the first film, released in 1990, as that is by far my favorite of the four.

Taking into account the low-budget nature of this film and its use of soft light, the Blu-ray accurately brings the look of this film into the living room, as if a film reel were being projected onto your HDTV. A nice layer of natural grain, exceptional detail, accurate color reproduction, and so on--this movie looks beautiful, and alone is worth the purchase of this box set if you're a hardcore fan of the film. The review by Kenneth Brown strikes me as odd, as I do not notice grain zapping/reduction and heavy use of edge enhancing to compensate. I've seen plenty of such HD transfers, and this looks NOTHING like what the reviewer describes. The grain is very natural. And the ""inconsistent contrast"" and ""poorly resolved blacks"" are due more to the nature of the lower quality film stock as well as the soft lighting. Do these ""professional"" Blu-ray reviewers not know anything about film???

Being now a fan of the original Mirage Studios comics by Eastman and Laird, I appreciate this film even more now than I did as a kid considering how faithful it is to the source material. The tone is decidedly more adult, though not something that kids aren't welcomed into enjoying (most of the comics were the same way, barring some exceptions like Eastman and Simon Bisley's ""Bodycount"" miniseries); the story follows closely a select few issues, with any additions and changes gelling with the source material exceptionally well and being necessary for the plot to carry on without hampering (e.g., April O'Neil being a news reporter a la the cartoon series, rather than a computer programmer working for Baxter Stockman--that whole plot would not have worked here in 90 minutes for what they aimed for, and is ultimately unnecessary in this telling); Raphael is the main protagonist, with his journey to quell his anger and understand himself, standing out amongst his brothers, and his hard-shelled loyalty to his brothers and master as well as his meeting and friendship with Casey Jones driving the plot forward (after all, in the comics, Raphael in the ""Return to New York"" series is the one who drove the other Turtles to go after Shredder after their defeat at April's store/apartment); implementing the Turtles' and Splinter's origin story in the comics real closely with, again, some necessary changes to keep the plot and film pacing flowing; and, man, I could go on and on!

What I'm trying to say is, it's faithful to the source material, it doesn't pander to the kiddies (though again is a great movie for kids) unlike the two live-action sequels did, and in addition to that, it's written, directed, acted, photographed, scored, and edited exceptionally well. There's also those cuh-ray-zee special effects by Jim Henson and company, which are a marvel to behold.

1990's ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is an incredibly well-made low-budget film which became a smashing success, understandably so due to the popularity of the Turtles at the time, but I believe also because of how competently made it is. Call me crazy, but I think it's one of the absolute finest films ever made, and I thought that even before I got all nutty over the original Mirage comics. It's not just some old flick to enjoy for nostalgia factor or to tout around on college campus while wearing a TMNT T-shirt, fondly joking about how ""Radical!"" the Turtles are; this is expert filmmaking at its finest, and the Blu-ray of the film is beautiful and totally faithful to the low-budget film source.

One thing that I'm a little disappointed about--and this isn't enough to bring it down a star or anything, it's still a 5-star product regardless--is that there are no alternate or deleted scenes. The movie was originally supposed to end differently, and there were some censorship issues as well. These missing scenes and edits would be great to see. I love having the theatrical cut of the film, but I hope that someday in the future we'll see a proper Steve Barron director's cut.

As said in the beginning: Extremely, highly recommended! While I'm not as big of a fan of the other movies, and really kind of despise the third, I'm happy to own all four of them in the best quality possible; and really, the rest of the three look as faithful as the first.

If you're familiar with the live-action films but not the CGI one and are looking for an opinion on that: It's a good film. If you follow the 2003 cartoon series at all, it's a welcome addition to that, with some cool designs and animation. It's a whole lotta fun, and definitely my second favorite Ninja Turtles movie (with third being ""Turtles Forever"", fourth ""Secret of the Ooze"", and fifth the dreaded turd/third movie).",1287100800,20,6160,4.7755868544600935

This set consists of the three original live-action Turtles films from the early-to-mid 1990s, and the computer-animated TMNT film from 2007, along with a sheet of temporary tattoos - all packaged in a standard plastic keepcase, with two double-sided pages inside, one disc per side.  The tattoos are stored under the literature clips on the inside cover, and there's nothing on the inside back cover.

Each of the four discs is a bit-for-bit copy (a ""disc image"") of a previous DVD release.  All four movies are 16:9 widescreen, with Turtles 2 & 3 also containing 4:3 fullscreen versions. (Full disc specs are below.)  Apparently in the original releases, Turtles 1 & TMNT were dual-sided discs with widescreen on one side and fullscreen on the other - and they only used the widescreen sides for this re-release.  That's fine with me.

These same four discs (with the same disc art) and temporary tattoos are also available in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/25th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition-box-set/dp/B00284AVI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""25th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" box set</a>, which adds in some cloth masks and puts the discs in what appears to be a round CD holder, which is then apparently stored in an outer cardboard box with the masks.  I bought this for 25 bucks at Walmart, which had a sticker on front proclaiming ""Only At Wal*Mart - Includes Turtle Tattoos"".  Since the tattoos are available in the ""25th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" box set, it must be the standard packaging that's exclusive to Walmart.

I have read this review of a guy that said that this collection had no extras and thats not true for starters the Blu-ray pakage has:All 4 Films with Extras and Collectibles like Comic Book, Sketch with Co-Creator Peter Laird's Autograph, Radical Beanie Hat and 8 TMNT Character Cards, plus extra content.

So I don't know if this guy got the DVD version of it (I don't know what does this one has in it), but the blu-ray certanly does has extras.

I'm absolutely thrilled that the original live-action TMNT (1990) movie is being offered on Blu-Ray, and the other 3 films are an extra bonus, may be not as good as the first one but hey! This are good turtle films none the less.

If you are a BIG turtle fan you will certanly enjoy this colection, if not buy the TMNT (1990) movie on DVD because Im sure they won't sellit on Blu-ray alone.

This box set is intended to conmemorate the 25th anniversary, and some rumors said that this box set will be available for a short period of time, so If you are/were a fan this is a must have.

3776988,4,B001RIZE3M,"Ever since I started watching blu-ray last year, I had always wondered when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies would come out on blu-ray. They've been overdue for a remastering, and plus, their anniversary is this year, so what better timing? I saw this set pop up right here on Amazon and I saw that my wish had finally been fulfilled. The question is, though, did they get the remastering they deserved?

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The classic that everyone knows and loves. It's darker in tone than the other three, thus capturing the original comic book feel that Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman gunned for back when they did the original comics. Of course, parents didn't like it, so the tone didn't stay in future sequels. However, the literal darkness of the film happens to be the achilles' heel of this release. There's grain all over the place. It looks as if they transferred some of it, but didn't bother to do it on some scenes. One scene where Raph wanders out in broad daylight wearing a trench coat is where the grain is at it's worst, believe it or not. The dark scenes ALL have grain all over them. Some scenes are entirely devoid of any grain, though. So, what gives Warner Bros.? Couldn't touch all of it up? Now, believe me when I say this: This is the best the movie has ever looked. However, it lacks the detail of better blu-ray releases (though some of the detail is noticeable in the costumes of the Turtles), and the grain was to be expected, considering how dark the movie originally was, and as well as it being rather low-budget when it was first shot. The animatronics still stand the test of time, and this is the best they've ever looked, but I still wish more effort was put into reducing the grain and enhancing the details in a lot of scenes. Overall, if you don't mind grain in your films, you'll be fine with it, but this could be better.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze - My personal favorite of the collection. I've watched this countless times growing up on VHS. It looked rough then, but blu-ray has done it some justice. The grain isn't nearly as bad as the first movie, which is a plus, and it's not even noticeable much at all in brighter scenes. Plus, the detail has been enhanced to a fault. It's still not quite perfect in any regards, but I was satisfied overall withe visual quality. Tokka looks great with ever little greasy detail on his scaly body, and in the opening scene in the robbery, you can actually make out the faces of the robbers through their panty hose masks. This is also the best animatronics of the three live-action movies, and is timeless in it's execution. This is the best the movie has ever looked, though there are still some steps that could be made to better the picture just a little more. I was happy with it, though.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III - I'm not typing ""Turtles in Time"" next to it because some idiot at Warner Bros. put that on the box. That is not the official subtitle to the movie, it's the name of the Arcade/SNES video game, and it's a very good one, at that. Anyways, this is the most hated of the series, and within good reason The plot features absolutely no key villains from the Turtles universe, the animatronics are terrible (their lips flap around like Big Mouth Billy Bass) as they weren't Jim Henson's work like the previous movies, and the plot overall is so-so. However, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I don't really remember watching it as a child, just the first two movies, so I'm really taking this viewing as a first, to my recollection. As for the transfer, it's the best of the three live-action movies by far. Besides a tiny bit of grain in the opening scene with the samurais riding in the sunrise, there's no more to be found. The Turtles looked highly detailed, right down to the pores on the costumes. The lush Japanese setting looks gorgeous in this transfer, and it really makes the movie that much more bearable to watch. While it lacks a sound plot and has laughably bad animatronics, it looks very well done. If only this much effort were put into the previous two, this would be the best package possible.

TMNT - I actually saw this in theatres the day after it came out, I owned it on DVD first day, and I got it on blu-ray last Christmas, so this is actually a triple-dip retail buy, for me. The plot is solid, though it it is reminiscent of the goofy single episode plots they used to have in the 80's cartoons, mixed in with some internal struggle amongst the Turtles, especially Raph and Leo, of course. Some say Mike and Don play nothing but mere cameos, but they make a significant enough appearance to make an impact. There's enough laughs to know that at least Mikey is around in good quantity. As for the picture quality, it looks exactly as it did before on blu-ray, and that means there's nothing wrong with it. It is blu-ray perfection. Screenshots do not do it justice. Every turtle is brilliantly detailed, you can see every hair on Splinter, every detail in every wall, and don't even get me started on one key fight over halfway through the movie that I will not reveal due to possibly spoiling the movie. This fight, which takes place in the rain, is one of the single most gorgeous pieces of CG work I have ever seen. It's brilliantly animated, just as the rest of the movie is, and the amount of detail is mind-blowing. This movie is one of the greatest showpieces for the blu-rat format you will ever find, only to be rivaled by Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete, which still stands as the most gorgeous movie of all time, in my eyes. A perfect picture for a great CG movie, overall.

As for extras, you get everything previous releases got. That's it. The only difference is that there's a trailer for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up, coming to the Wii and PS2 next month, on the first movie's disc, but it's the very first trailer released, so its nothing new. It's just mastered in hi-def, though the actual game will look nothing like it, so what's the use? Overall, Warner did a terrible job for adding any special interviews, featurettes, or commentaries to commemorate the 25th Anniversary. I could personally care less about extra features, but those that are steamed about it are within good reason.

The extras we DO get, however, is part of the packaging. As you can see in the pictures one member nicely posted, it comes in a pizza box-esque design. I love it. It's actually much sturdier than you'd think, and the discs hold into their trays rather tightly. You also get 8 collectible cards, a reproduction sketch signed by Peter Laird (though it's printed, not actually signed), a reproduction of the original comic by Eastman and Laird that is based off of the original movie, an a beanie hat, which looks like it'd fit a younger head rather than an adult head, though I haven't unpackaged it for collectible reasons. It's a nice package overall, though many have complained about it not being in normal elite cases. You can always do custom cases, but this works perfectly fine and suits the collection well.

You may be wondering ""Why the 4 stars?"" after the first two movies weren't done as well as they could have been, but it's simple: This is the best they've looked. If you want a better picture for all of them, this is the only way to go, and they all look better, especially the last two. I did knock off a star because they didn't go the extra mile for the release by adding extra bonus features nor remastering the first two movies as thoroughly as they should have. However, hardcore Turtle fans like me will love it, I can say that much. It's worth the $60, in my eyes, but if you're only particular of getting the first movie (which I have found many are), wait up on this release. One can hope that it will get a re-release down the line from Warner like 300 and The Matrix have gotten, and hopefully, with better quality, as it's the one that got the short end of the stick, and the one most people will likely not be that satisfied with. However, if you want Turtles II and onward, they all look good to fantastic, so it's worth the purchase.",1250812800,82,8189,4.499327956989247
3776989,4,B001RIZE3M,"Honestly never expected turtles to get Bluray treatment. Got my Bluray set in the mail Tuesday and just got around to watching all 4 in a marathon. My girlfriend and I got a pizza and powered through them all. The set is awesome, comes with some cool stuff. I have the comic and I don't wear beanies but it was still a nice addition. I like the box a lot as well, I didn't at first but it's cooler in person. The little post cards are neat. The turtles look horrible on them though.

The first movie is odd it goes from looking good to bad. The darker scenes really suffer from grain. Still fun to watch and even after all these years I still enjoy the film. I was afraid the high def would take away from the film but it didn't. The costumes still hold up quite well.

The second movie looks the same all the way through. It looks good but nothing amazing. Still my favorite film out of the series. I caught a few things I never saw before, like on Tokka's costume I could see the actors head in the neck in a few scenes. Nothing that took away from my enjoyment of the movie though.

The third movie looks pretty good but everything in it is extremely bad. Some how the high def makes it look even worse. The lip syncing is super off half the time. I just couldn't handle it. I made it about 30 minutes in and I had to turn it off. I hadn't seen it in 12+ years and I had no expectations and it was still some how so bad I couldn't bare watching it.

The fourth movie of course looked good. It's also the only one that's not anamorphic so it has widescreen bars. I'd seen it so many times I just kinda glanced over it. I can take or leave the movie, typically leave.

Great set though, totally worth the cash. Cool box art and the transfers only favor the films in most cases. The menus could have used  a little work. The menu for the first film probably looks the best.

Fun things I never noticed when watching it before in standard def. Danny has a Gizmo comic in the first scene in April's apartment. Also the warehouse has Archie comic boxes all over it. This is probably stuff other people have seen already before but it was new to me.",1250467200,3,2145,4.141826923076923

3776991,1,B001RIZE3M,"**WARNING TMNT FANS**

--This set contains absolutely nothing new from the previous 2 releases of the live action films and the cgi movie is simply a port of the standalone disc with regards to special features and the transfer--

I'm not sure what all of the 5 star reviews are all about for this so called 25th anniversary boxset so far, but let me be the first to offer a counter to those ""generous"" scores with a dose of the reality of the situation.

This set offers nothing new from what is already available on the standalone dvds, safe for a few cheap gimmicks like 4 cloth masks and some temporary tattoos. The only thing new here is the package art and believe me it isn't worth $30, which is actually Amazon's price, the MSRP is actually more. There is no commentary on any of the movies except the most recent one which is simply ported over from the other single disc release. The transfers are the same that was used for the initial 1998 dvd releases of the 3 movies and the age really shows on the films, especially that of the live action ones. No deleted scenes or making of featurettes talking about Jim Henson's creature shop for the live action films. No Elias Koteas (Casey Jones) interview or anything. Nothing but the theatrical trailers.

Here's a fun fact for all of you turtles fans. The director of the 1st turtles movie (the best one) has come out publicly and stated that he has deleted and extended scenes in his possession that he would like to contribute to a special edition of the 1st movie along with contributing directors commentary if WB were interested. Apparently they are not. They would rather whore out this franchise and continue to kick loyal fans in the face. The only shellebration going on here is one of greed and laziness on behalf of WB Studio with there franchise. This franchise deserved much better for it's 25th anniversary than a cheaply slapped together rerelease. One can only hope that for the 30th anniversary and no doubt next ""shellebration"" that WB will decide to put together a real boxset as opposed to expecting fans to ""shell"" out more money for nothing new. I hope if anything that the 1st movie gets an eventual 2 disc special edition that it so richly deserves with a new hi def transfer and all the special features that the director has and wants to contribute because it is the only one that really holds up anyway today. Thanks for nothing WB.

1 out of 5 stars for the piss poor effort by WB for this storied franchise that deserves better. For those of you who already have 1 of the 2 prior releases of the live action movies, stick with your previous copies and don't contribute a dime to Warner Bros. Studio. They put no effort into this boxset. For those of you who don't own any of the movies yet, I urge you to go and pick up the standalone movies for dirt cheap. You can find them for $5 a piece on most retail sites and brick and morter stores and you'd be getting the exact same content on them that is on this boxset as well as the same transfer so you're not missing a thing and saving your money. Don't contribute to WB's lazy and cheap triple dip. Show them we expect more for this franchise and maybe they will listen for the next go round.",1250121600,65,3229,4.447635135135135
3776992,5,B001RIZE3M,"Hi everyone , okay i recently bought this from a book store online and i got it in the mail a few days ago and i'm sad to say for a re-release of the dvds THERE ARE NO SPECIAL FEATURES AGAIN. It's pretty much the same dvds as the orignals and the second set that was release with newer cover art. the only diffrence really is the dvds come in a metal and nylon sewer lid dvd holder with all three movies plus the cgi one. It does have extra sleves to put more stuff in so i guess if you wanted it for cds or something. But the dvds themselves have no cases. And it comes with four cloth turtles masks and one sheet of temp tatoos of the cgi movie and that's it. I think for the 25th aniversary they could have had making of special features behind the scenes or a photo gallery at least or bloopers but nothing. I only gave it a 5 because i'm a hugh fan of the turtles and i love the movies to death and it is a nice set to get someone if they don't have the movies already but just don't expect anything new other then some tatoos and a dvd case and somes nice masks.",1250121600,,1068,3.9262672811059907

8338075,5,B001RIZE3M,"Most of these movies are excellent for any fans of TMNT.  I would even go so far as to say the first one is one of the best family movies ever made!  I can't say anything on the Blu-Ray quality (this was purchased as a prize for our patrons), but I can at least comment on the movies themselves.
TMNT1: This movie was a big risk that almost didn't get off the ground.  The animatronics are amazingly done, especially for their time.  The actual plot of the villain Shredder is a little bit silly, training a lot of ninjas to steal what would effectively work for a pawn shop, but it's somehow working until the turtles start to interfere.  This is really a solid family feature with real character growth & conflict.  For those highly conservative people out there, you might have an issue with the scene introducing the villains' lair.  The majority of the kids in there are gambling and/or smoking, but it's essentially a similar scenario to Pleasure Island from Pinocchio in that sense.  This is also easily the darkest TMNT movie in existence, both in tone and general lighting.  It almost makes you think this is what Tim Burton would've designed for TMNT.  There are moments in here that will touch you for the rest of your life.  If your family loves martial arts, you absolutely can't go wrong here.
TMNT2: Now you're playing with power.  Yeah, this was right from the time when anime starting hitting America and Power Rangers were in their prime.  Of course this means Shredder's plot is to make his own mutants loyal to him, and their power is definitely no joke.  This movie also plays it much safer in content.  Weapons are basically unused throughout the whole feature, possibly due to concern over kids imitating them and/or certain countries hating on the nunchaku used by Michelangelo (but turning sausages into nunchaku is just fine).  It's much jokier than its predecessor, obviously trying to appeal more to kids than the overall family this time around.  That said, it does still have its serious moments, such as Donatello literally questioning his existence (can easily spark a religious discussion with your family).  This one works for people who are already fans of TMNT, but if you're not into it already, this won't change your mind.  The final climax with Vanilla Ice is way catchier than it deserves to be.
TMNT3: This is the one TMNT movie I'd generally avoid.  For rather silly reasons, the turtles are thrust back in time into feudal Japan.  You'd think this would make for martial arts being much more prominent, but no, all the fight scenes just involve dumb dummies who exist for little more than getting beaten.  This is also the jokiest of the bunch, and a lot of the jokes were topical for the 90's.  Kids now would have no idea of Wayne's World or Don King.  That's not to say the movie's indefensible.  Since the turtles are on their own, far from home & their mentor Splinter, they end up coping in their own way, such as Raphael working with a kid's anger management that has always troubled himself.  When things resolve, the turtles even debate with each other if they should go back home, in the shadows, or stay here as a venered part of society.  These potentially strong moments are ultimately lost within all the silly action, though.  This is strictly for young children who love TMNT and not much else.  Good parents who watch with their kids can probably get some solid discussions out of it.  Otherwise, it's a TV babysitter.
TMNT (4): This entirely CGI feature is a later age of TMNT, working on an entirely different backstory.  It's established that these turtles have been at it for a long time, to the point I'd say they're probably far from teenagers at this point.  They've all pretty much retired from protecting New York, but of course circumstances force them back out of the shadows.  As usual, the main character growth is the conflict between Leonardo & Raphael, but this actually comes to a head as the two actually fight each other for real.  The lengths they go to in this feud actually shocked me as a long-time fan of TMNT.  The actual plot takes a while to really come out, despite it getting heavily frontloaded.  When the main conflict does finally come together, you really start to feel for the villains, which I certainly wouldn't expect from children's entertainment like this.  It makes you see all the characters as genuine people.  The family theme is much stronger here, perhaps a little too strong, but it still has a solid place as a good family movie.

Ultimately, is this worth $25 & up?  Probably not.  The movies are mostly solid, but they're also all easily available in some form.  $25 itself might be reasonable for a Blu-Ray, but don't let yourself go above that.  As of this writing it sits at about $15, which is perfectly reasonable.  $5 for 3 good movies (TMNT 3 isn't really worth a purchase) is very justifiable.",1525392000,,4911,4.6670547147846335
