7027049,5,B00U0R1RGE,"Even thought these were filmed in 16mm (the BBC standard) they will still be a great improvement over the old washed out standard definition film transfers from the early 1990's.

The episodes have been completely remastered to high definition quality from the original film elements by BBC Studios and Post Production's Digital Media Services team.

Regarded by many fans as the definitive Miss Marple, Joan Hickson was one of the oldest actresses to take a lead role in a major television series when she was cast as Agatha Christie's soft-spoken, sharp-eared sleuth at the age of 78 in 1984. She retired eight years later, having completed 12 mysteries in the Miss Marple series - four of which are collected in this volume.

These are in their original BBC versions, which varied greatly in their broadcast. Some as one episode, others split into multiple episodes.

Bonus:
a very british murder (PART 3) 50:00 - The final installment about British Mystery Literature.

Sadly missing (at least from the pre-view disc) from this 3-volume series is the wonderful bonus on the old BBC DVD ""CRIME DOES PAY"" which features the historic meeting of Joan Hickson (Miss Marple) and David Suchet (Hercule Poirot) in a celebration of Agatha Christie.  While the BBC owns the rights to Miss Marple, Acorn Media owns the rights to Agatha Christie and Poirot.  Could this split in rights be the reason we are denied this bonus?
Alas I must keep my old BBC DVD of Miss Marple.

The BBC has decided to present these mysteries in the order in which the BOOKS were published, and not the order in which the TV series was produced.  Otherwise this would have been set #2.",1431302400,13,2393,4.534883720930233

The new series are like a whole new program. Yes it is in box format but this is because the 16mm film format is box format. The sound is clear and not mufilled, there are subtitles. The colors have contrast, saturation and crispness. They are not cheap, but the tech hours to redue these films is enormous! The price is worth every penny. These dvds will last for generations. There was only one Joan Hickson.",1429833600,23,550,4.455445544554456
7027052,5,B00U0R1RGE,"Oh Frabjous Day!  The last set of the remastered Miss Marples starring Joan Hickson is available to order. I have all her Marples on the 2000 DVD issues. But I've watched them so many times I decided to buy Volume One of the remastered sets, just to see if it would be worth it. It was! Now I have Volumes One & Two and the colors are bright and beautiful, the viewing sharp, the sound cleaned up, and the mysteries and personalities as wonderful as ever.

Volume Three has four episodes and one bonus extra on the last disc. The bonus is Part 3 of Dr. Lucy Worsley's 3-part TV series ""A Very British Murder"". (Parts 1 and 2 of Worsley's fun look at murder in England appears on the Miss Marple remasterings' Volume One & Two.)

Following Volumes One & Two, the Volume 3 episodes are presented in the original 4:3 aspect ratio. Sound is still mono, but it has been cleaned up. English subtitles are available. There's a total 450 minutes of excellent mystery viewing.

Episode 1 ""A Caribbean Mystery""
Miss Marple has had a bout of bronchitis. Her nephew Raymond sends her on a holiday to Barbados for recovery, a restful time at the Golden Palm Hotel. She's brought her knitting, which she finds useful when Major Palgrave begins telling his interminable stories. She doesn't even pay attention when he asks her, ""Like to see the picture of a killer, hey?"" Unfortunately, somebody else does hear him, and he is murdered that night. Given the cast of characters staying at the hotel, Miss Marple has her work cut out for her fingering the killer.

Episode 2 ""At Bertram's Hotel"" (Parts 1 & 2)
People are converging on Bertram's Hotel, tucked away in London. Miss Marple arrives for a visit and is most surprised to see that it hasn't changed at all from how she remembers it decades before. You and I would go with the flow, happy for service no longer offered in your average hotel. Miss Marple, however, is suspicious.
As arranged, Jane is joined by her friend, Lady Selena, who points out another guest: ""Bess Sedgwick. Of all places!"" All places, indeed. What is a vibrant adventurer such as Sedgwick doing in an old-fashioned hotel?
More characters show up. Canon Pennygather, a gentle man who's memory seems to leave him stranded as if it were a cat. Ladislaus Malinowski, a race-car driver leaving mysterious messages. Elvira Blake, young, beautiful and impatient. Michael Gorman, the doorman with a history.
There are several threads in this great episode, and the murder doesn't happen until well into it. Clues are given and the ending is magnificent, not the least due to Caroline Blakiston's outstanding acting as Bess Sedgwick.

Episode 3 ""Nemesis"" (Parts 1 & 2)
Self-made millionaire Jason Rafiel knows he is dying. He sits in his shaded conservatory, in his fine mansion, on his private island. His secretary has completed a last task for him. He tells her, in almost his last breath: ""It's up to her now. Thousands of years ago, she had a measuring yard, a sword and a whip, yes, called a scourge. She rode about in a chariot pulled by gryphons. Nemesis! Last time I saw her, she was wearing a pink wooly shawl.""
From beyond the grave, Rafiel summons Miss Marple as ""the inescapable agent of someone's or something's downfall."" But he doesn't tell her why or even who. She takes up the challenge. He wouldn't have willed her 20,000 if it wasn't important.

Episode 4 ""The Sleeping Murder"" (Parts 1 & 2)
After 3 years in New Zealand, Giles Reed has returned to England with a wife, the 20 year-old Gwenda. They've spent the day apartment hunting in Devon, and are about to call it a day. Driving down a hedge-lined road, Gwenda cries out, asking Giles to stop. Through the overgrown roadside plants, they see Hillside, a large house overlooking the road. That's the house for her. Giles laughs, ""Darling, you can't buy a house when you're just married. People retire to Dillmouth."" But it's what she unaccountably wants.
Raymond West is Gile's cousin, and invites them to visit in London. As Miss Marple is Raymond's aunt, she gets to meet the Reeds, too. They all troop to see the play, ""The Duchess of Malfi"", and in the middle of the show, Gwenda starts screaming in terror. Fortunately for her, the piercingly perceptive Miss Marple is there, to solve a murder that has been sleeping for 18 years.
Hear one of Miss Marple's most famous lines in this episode: ""It's very dangerous to believe people. I haven't for years.""

Bonus Feature
""A Very British Murder - Part Three: The Golden Age"" (50 minutes) Presented by Lucy Worsley, I've found this 3-part series to be very entertaining. She introduces Part Three with: ""Edwardian press barons were demanding a murder a day for the pleasure of their newspaper readers."" Readers' mystery appetites were satisfied in two ways. The first was the sensationalized coverage of real life murders. Worsley takes us through two of these,  Dr. Crippen (1910) and the mild-mannered Liverpool insurance agent, William Herbert Wallace.

The 2nd way readers were appeased was the dawn of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. The first writer covered is Dame Agatha Christie: ""As a foreigner, Poirot stood outside the rigid British class structure, which most of the Golden Age detectives belonged to."" The next writer is Dorothy L. Sayers. Both Christie and Sayers were founding members of The Detection Club, still going today 85 years later.

Simon Brent, current Master of Ceremonies for the club, takes Worsley through the beginning of the induction ceremony for new detective fiction writers. I got a kick out of the playful wording used and questions asked, including, ""Will you honor the Queen's English?"" Brent also says, of the Golden Age, ""I think there was something in the Zeitgeist. I think it's no coincidence that was also the period when the crossword puzzle developed.""

The last writer covered is Graham Greene, who ushered in a new era. He wrote in the manner of the Americans Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. Darker, grittier, and very much not the country house murders.

The only bad thing about Volume Three is my sadness that these are the last of Joan Hickson's Miss Marples.

Don't miss the first two volumes:

7027076,5,B00U0R1RGE,"I think that Joan Hickson as Marple, and the general worthiness of this masterpiece of a series have been described often enough for it to not need repeating here. Instead, I'll review the main feature of this product - The remastering.
This was everything it was advertised to be - Marple in full visual glory, more beautiful, crisper, and clearer than the first time I watched it, way back in the 80's. Heck, some scenes are so vivid, so clear and beautiful, that they could only have been made more real by being in 3D.
This volume, the third and final one, was of particular interest to me because Nemesis is my favorite story of the entire series, and this was... well, it was like watching it again for the very first time. It was an incredible experience.
Suddenly, Marple is living in a thatched cottage (I never noticed the roof! Hardly surprising in the murk of the original.), and there's a straw-colored ribbon on the edge of her hat (It was invisible before), and her eyes are so piercingly blue (who could tell before, when the whole show looked like ""50,000 shades of beige""?). Even what was obvious before, like the garish colours on the killer's sweater, is made doubly so by the remastering.
This is the sort of product that just makes you happy to be living in what is essentially ""The Future"", when marvels like this are possible.
It was a pricier purchase than I usually allow myself, but it was entirely worth it.",1447459200,3,1435,4.587548638132295

I even developed a strong dislike for Inspector (it isn't Lestrade...that's from the Sherlock stories) , well whatever his name is he remained a pain throughout.  He kept his character en pointe.  I thought the addition of his avocation with Magic  a perfect complement to his sometime incomprehensible character.  But the star of the show is Joan Hickson.  She is Jane Marples.

7027102,5,B00U0R1RGE,"I am probably  one of the few reviewers here who did not see this series when it originally showed on PBS. Yes, I've seen other Miss Marples but not Joan Hickson. And I agree that she is the perfect one!

I looked at some other reviews posted for each of the three ""collections"" being released by BBC Home Video - each with four stories (varying in length from 90 minutes to two hours), and beautifully remastered for great color and sound -  and I see some really lengthy ones that describe each story in minute detail. I'm not sure I understand why they would do this since, after all, these are mysteries and they are best enjoyed (in my opinion, at least) when you know very little. And, all the stories are great and so knowing even the subject won't make you enjoy these sets any more.

Yes, you could easily start with any of the three ""volumes"" as Marple stories do not need to be read (or watched) in any special order. BUT, if you are interested in the significant (in terms of time)  bonus feature  - a three-hour ""documentary"" exploring the Brits love for crime and detective fiction - you probably want to start with Volume One.

Now, as for the ""documentary"", I have to say I was disappointed with it - for a number of reasons. I expected to see many excerpts from British TV mysteries and they aren't there. The three hours are ""hosted"" by Dr. Lucy Worsley. Who is ""chief curator of the Royal Palaces"" in London. Worsley dresses up in period costumes and recreates some of the famous crime stories by visiting the locations. What bothered me most was Worsley's speech inflection. She has a strong lisp and - sort of like BARBARA Walters she can't pronounce her ""r""s and they come out like ""w""s .  This may not bother you but it did bother me a lot and made watching what I hoped would be a great bonus a chore.

Even without the bonus docu-drama with Worsley , these sets are worth getting to watch Hickson as the low-key crime solver in stunning colors and sound. (Remember though that these were filmed from 1985-92 so, though they now have HD resolution, the image aspect is still the old standard 4:3 ratio.

7027103,5,B00U0R1RGE,Miss Marple stories are great who-dun-it's. Good viewing for the whole family.,1438646400,,78,5.583333333333333
7027104,5,B00U0R1RGE,"What can I say, Miss Marple rocks!! I already had the old DVDs of this series, but these are nice!!! I am a huge Agatha Christie fan and Marple, Poirot, the Beresford series etc., got them all!!",1438560000,,194,4.27027027027027
7027105,5,B00U0R1RGE,A further 4 mysteries spread over 7 episodes made in the usual impeccable manner by the BBC with Miss Marple spreading her wings to now being in the Caribbean to solve a mystery  before clearing some more cases in her special manner back in England.,1437696000,,249,4.533333333333333
7027106,1,B00U0R1RGE,"I did not receive a dvd that would play on both my two Sony blu-ray players.  It plays only on one of them, oddly, and the other refuses to recognize it. The case is different packaging from Volume I and II in Blu-ray (recently ordered on Amazon and perfectly fine on both), smaller and less rigid, and is stamped 'Made in Mexico', which may explain something.  I complained and have not received a refund so apparently am doomed to watch this one only in the basement blu-ray player. Not happy at all.",1437177600,,502,4.445652173913044
7027107,5,B00U0R1RGE,Outstanding,1437091200,,11,11.0
7027108,5,B00U0R1RGE,How can one improve on Jan Hickson's Miss Marple ?  This new set has brighter colors and clearer sound than the old set of these same stories. You can't go wrong with this set...it's a classic.  This is the third and final volume of this grand reissue.,1437091200,,252,4.340425531914893
7027109,5,B00U0R1RGE,"Had the DVD's, the blu-ray added to my enjoyment since I just LOVE the old classic mysteries, especially Agatha Christie and this Jane Marple.",1436832000,,142,4.958333333333333
7027110,5,B00U0R1RGE,Big fan.,1436659200,,8,3.5
7027111,5,B00U0R1RGE,thank you for subtitles - now my husband can enjoy Joan Hickson as much as I do,1436572800,,79,3.7058823529411766
7027112,5,B00U0R1RGE,"I like the Blu-ray version. It also has the complete production, bits that I never saw before, and some time makes the actors comment with each other make more since.",1436400000,,166,4.566666666666666
7027113,3,B00U0R1RGE,"This review is about a feature of the DVD format; other reviews deal expertly with DVD content. I was very surprised when I learned the STOP and RESUME feature are not part of the DVD format.  If you STOP this DVD it will restart of at the very beginning, not where you STOPPED. While they did supply tracks on the DVD, they are long in their length of time.",1436140800,,358,4.188405797101449
7027114,5,B00U0R1RGE,"It's long past time that these wonderful movies were cleaned up and captioned.  The color had faded so badly in the old releases.  This set has all my favorites, but every one of the Hickson movies were marvelous.",1436054400,,213,4.578947368421052
7027115,5,B00U0R1RGE,"These re-mastered sets are really great and worth replacing any previous DVD set you may have.  Joan Hickson is terrific as Miss Marple and I would certainly recommend adding Volumes One and Two from this re-mastered collection if you do not already have them.  ""A Caribbean Mystery"" and ""Sleeping Murder"" are stand-outs in this Volume Three set.  It also contains ""At Bertram's Hotel"" and ""Nemesis"" which are very good - they just aren't my favorite Agatha Christie mysteries but these episodes move along just fine.",1435881600,7,517,5.0588235294117645
7027116,5,B00U0R1RGE,Gorgeous color...or should I write colour!!  Looks terrific and a treasure for Marple fans!,1435881600,,91,5.5
7027117,5,B00U0R1RGE,Very well done re-issue in HD.  Both the sound and video quality are superb.  I love all the Miss Marple and Poirot mysteries.  And Joan Hickson is my very favorite Miss Marple.  She was chosen for that role by none other than Agatha Christie herself.,1435795200,9,251,4.511111111111111
7027118,5,B00U0R1RGE,It's Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. Nuff said.,1434758400,,44,4.625
7027119,5,B00U0R1RGE,As expected have just started to watch the blu ray edition and as with the first 2 volumes all I can say is Amazing picture and sound quality superb the one and only Miss Marple and 3 of my favourite stories on bluray brilliant.,1434499200,,228,4.204545454545454
7027120,3,B00U0R1RGE,"remastered video ok, but subtitles are missing parts (words and parts of conversations) and wrong word(s).

Examples of missing in Nemesis
1) I'll just get myself an orange squash then.
2) I could have.
3) - we're glad about that.
- Well, who is it?

what's missing"" in Nemesis
1) I had a coffee at the hotel.
Well, I'll just get myself an orange squash then.
2) Well I could have done. I could have.
But you can't run people's lives for them. Can you.
3) - Well I am sure we'll all be glad
when all this business is cleared up.
- Well, who is it?

So if you are dependent on subtitles then you'll miss what hearing don't. Otherwise the episodes are great.",1434326400,,656,4.232
7027121,5,B00U0R1RGE,"Marvelous colors, textures and detail in the Blu-ray version - far superior to the regular DVD version!",1434240000,,103,5.117647058823529
7027122,5,B00U0R1RGE,"I'll keep this short and sweet---I owned the previous DVD set of these Miss Marple classics and the clarity in this newly remastered set is far superior.  I'll be purchasing volumes 1 and 2 as well.  If you are looking to upgrade, or to purchase these films for the first time, I highly recommend this version.  :-)",1434067200,13,315,4.491228070175438
8703713,5,B00U0R1RGE,Great...thanks!,1533168000,,15,15.0
8703714,5,B00U0R1RGE,I love Joan Hickson a lot better than other actors and the plots are more closer to the actual books.,1532044800,,101,4.1
8703715,5,B00U0R1RGE,Super. I had not watched any of Miss Marple and will now watch more of this series!,1522886400,,83,3.9411764705882355
8703716,5,B00U0R1RGE,Great stories without the graphic nature of modern movies. Great to relax and enjoy.,1522540800,,84,5.071428571428571
8703717,5,B00U0R1RGE,"I enjoy mystery movies,especialty the cunning Ms. Marple.",1519344000,,57,6.25
8703718,5,B00U0R1RGE,"Joan Hixson, for me, is THE quintessential Miss Marple. I judge all other ""Marples"" based on her. I read the books and stories first and Joan Hixson fits almost exactly my mental picture of Miss Marple. The videos are well made. The one thing I didn't really care for was the way the stories were divided. I knowthat the discs are following the way they were initially broadcast, but I would have liked the story to be ne complete story, instead of Part , Part 2. Small thing, but that is only negative I can think of.",1518739200,,518,4.350515463917525
8703719,5,B00U0R1RGE,Cannot beat Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.  Good stuff.,1514764800,,53,4.888888888888889
8703720,4,B00U0R1RGE,PBS always does a better job at mystery shows.,1509235200,,46,4.222222222222222
