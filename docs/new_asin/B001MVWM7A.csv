3701047,4,B001MVWM7A,"This show encompassed the bulk of my teenage years. I'm not a Christian, and I won't claim it never got preachy or stupid (especially later on), but I have such good memories of watching it. I loved it, and I still enjoy it even with all its flaws. I liked a lot of the episodes of this season, especially Simon's arc in the beginning and Mary falling into a marriage that ultimately worked for her.

But as the title said, one thing drives me nuts. ""Charity Begins at Home"": In the TV version the song playing over the end was John Mayer's ""What The World Needs Now is Love"", but the DVD version replaced it with a cheery pop song. That in and of itself doesn't bother me, it wouldn't be the first time a DVD release had to work around music copyrights. No, what bothers me is I can't find the lyrics or even the actual artist name for the DVD's song! Yeah, it's manufactured Disney ""country"" bubblegum but I really liked it. Who sings it, and how is it not on YouTube?

Ah, well. This season was still a pretty good one, in my book. Not the best, but an improvement over how season 7 began.",1473552000,,1092,4.2451923076923075

3701051,5,B001MVWM7A,Love this show. It is just like real life. Some of the main characters haven't been in this season so it's a little different. Still love this show and can't get enough of it.,1466726400,,175,4.176470588235294
3701052,3,B001MVWM7A,"It's watchable, but definitely not as good as the previous seasons.  I miss Matt, Simon and Mary.  It's like a completely different show with way too many new characters.  As much as I love the show, they probably could have ended it after 7 seasons.",1465948800,,250,4.511111111111111
3701053,3,B001MVWM7A,"I love the series, but this season feels like the writers are spending more time making the public aware of causes than actually following any plot lines.  They do finally bring it all together, but surely lost some viewers in Season 8.  You do get to see some new characterless and lose a few others.  Would I watch it again?  Yes, of course.  If you love the Camdens, you will too.",1465516800,,383,4.338028169014085

3701083,3,B001MVWM7A,"The series started going downhill about here, if not earlier. Super preachy (no pun intended), writers painfully aware (read: clearly writing to) their audience. But I keep watching, because it's still endearing. Also, not sure why ads started playing just now after watching 8 seasons, but I'm not a fan. I pay for Prime, just like I pay for Netflix, so I would expect no ads. Maybe I'm wrong idk.",1448323200,,398,4.7

3701118,4,B001MVWM7A,"As I have noted before, this is must watch series for anyone interested in surveying the struggles parents have with our secular society's influence on children. The writers should be commended. As Father Barron notes in his Youtube messages, wealth, power, pleasure and honor do not provide the true happiness that can only emanate from God. No wonder his favorite Shakespeare play is Macbeth: he gets all four only to discover life signifies ""nothing.""  We are what we worship.

My concern with 7th Heaven is staying focused on responsible parenting, and less on the ""soap-operish"" themes which on occasion surface, but do watch the show!!

I recommend Father Barron, Joel Osteen, Billy Graham, the American Religious Town Hall, Bishop Sheen, Dr. D. James Kennedy and Cardinal Dolan.",1418860800,,785,5.165354330708661

3701190,5,B001MVWM7A,"We have the First 6 Seasons of this wonderful show, we were going to buy season 7 but it was more expensive than 8, so we just got this one.  This Season has a lot of Lucy and her new Dreamy husband Kevin Kinkirk in it.  If you want to teach your daughters what type of man she should look for as a husband, look no further than this young man in Season 8.  Kevin Kinkirk is the epitomy of a Young, Christian, Gentleman at all times, even when he's alone with his wife, he gives her total respect and gentle kindness, even when they disagree.  He is so good at trying to warn Lucy, when she's about to get in over her head, sometimes she listens, somtimes not, but she always wishes she had.  He's level headed, sweet hearted and just the dream of all parents anywhere, as Eric and Annie mention on the show.  The rest of the crowd are doing their best to live through Mary's previous antics, talk about a rebel!!! Simon is grown up a lot and gone part of the time, due to his accident, Ruthie has a boyfriend, which is hard to believe if you been watching seasons in sequence, but she is the most level headed Camden, so she generally makes them all look bad, because she does so much right.  The twins Sam and David are so funny, they talk quite a bit now, so they are cute and funny. You will love this Season, although everyone's going different directions, it is so much of how families are doing today, only this family does it through the help of God, I only wish more families could see this, or would choose to see this show as it covers nearly ever moral issue and mistakes that children, teens, and adults and parents are faced with daily.  I have never seen such a well written, well directed show in my entire life.  Thank you to the writers, actors and tv stations for airing the most wonderful, helpful parenting tool I have ever used, next to the Bible of course.  This helps kids with the visuals of things that could happen, are happening in the world today, and gives them the tools, ideas and problem solving skills to handle just about anything, from suicide, teen drinking, pregnancy, drugs, smoking, driving intoxicated, cutting, there are so many shows that each deal with one or more of these issues, I watch them WITH MY CHILD, THEN WE CAN DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AND HOW SHE MIGHT HANDLE SOME SITUATIONS IF FACED WITH THEM.  As a parent I can't say enough about how wonderful this show is, Eric and Annie don't always get it right, and that's the beauty of it all, we can't always get everything right, but at least we can learn from what they did right or wrong..It's a beautiful show, I only wish, I could meet and hug each actor and thank them for the positive influence they have had on my family for a couple of years now.  We can't get them on our television stations, we live way out in the country, don't have satellite or cable availability, but we sure have made a worthwhile investment in the DVD Seasons, and will continue to buy more from Amazon, I like what this company stands for.  Until the next season is purchased, God Bless You All!!  Buy All the Seasons of 7th Heaven you will not be disappointed!!! You just might be blessed and save a child from some awful fate, just by watching this show..  There's even a show in the 1st season that deals with Lucy getting her menstrual cycle, it's so helpful, it opens that door of communication with your daughter that some of my friends were having trouble with.

Each episode, as always has a beautiful message: a rarity it seems in television today.

And it is easy to see how the writers have faded out Mary in the last episode when she didn't even appear after the birth of her son.

I was blown away all over again as changes and new additions rock the Camden family. This is also the season where the focus shifts from the Camdens to basically the whole town and all the people they effect. Many new faces are introduced such as Martin and Peter's dad Vic.

I like the fact that it's a show of a pastor, his wife and family.  It's the first time that I've really seen what a Christian relationship (especially between a pastor and his wife) really should/could be.

The Supreme Court of Missouri has judicially noticed that the religious scheme of ""marriage"" with its attendant 57% life destroying felony theft divorce racketeering outcome involves ""property rights in persons"".  The adverse consequences of the criminal scheme of ""marriage"" alone make it no ""phobia"" to avoid the criminal scheme and consequent frauds and thefts.  Although in theory Americans are allowed freedom of association with others of their choice, thereby allowing cohabitation as a matter of personal choice, such ""property rights in persons"" are implicitly felony abrogations of Article XIII of the US Constitution Amendments.  Meanwhile those same ""religion"" gangs have subverted the goofermint so as to *prosecute* hetero relationships outside of the criminal gang control system of ""marriage"" and have inflicted terrorist homosexist medifraud object rape con dumbs on places of worship of hetero religion.  In context of felony abrogations of Articles I and XIV Section 1 ""exempting"" the criminal gang organizing centers and providing free housing to such as Eric and Annie and their brood, further providing inverse taxation for other antisocial population litterers, and radically reducing taxes on those who become feloniously enslaved regardless of sexual orientation, that regularly repeated insult against adult sexual relationships in ""7th Heaven"" requires a one star rating.",1501545600,,1564,5.782608695652174
