7833151,5,6302987237,"This was a classic World Series, and the last ""traditional"" Series, before the LCS was added. Bob Gibson dominated Detroit in the series, striking out 17 in Game 1, but was bested by Mickey Lolich, who won all three of his starts, including Game 7.

One of the top World Series of all time.",1217376000,,290,4.37037037037037
7833152,5,6302987237,"I was 13 years old when the Tigers won the World Series.  I attended 3 games that wonderful summer - one with my Dad who died this year.  One of the great times me and my Dad spent together. Norm Cash was my hero when I was a little kid - he had won the batting title in 1961 and he was a great guy.  Kaline, McClain, Freehan, Lolich,Wilson, Horton, Northrup, Stanley, Oyler, Wert and all the rest the comeback kids.  They did it all season - Gates Brown was super as a pinch hitter that wonderful summer!!! The World Series was just unforgettable - Gibson was great beating McClain in game one striking out 17 Tigers -- one of the best pitched games I ever saw.... Lolich was great in game 2 and game 7 -- the Tigers never gave up... even being down 3 games to one..... the play at the plate when Brock got thrown out by Horton was the turning point of the series.............  I have watched baseball for 45+ years and that season was my all time favorite!!!!!!!!!  Thanks Tigers...........",1159315200,3,992,4.335135135135135
