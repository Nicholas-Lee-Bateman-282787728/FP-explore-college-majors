1652539,4,B00005R2D4,"This movie was a childhood staple for me.  I can recall countless times I watched this movie with my grandparents - so I do consider myself a very reliable source for a review.

It's a great movie for these reasons:  it's an adventure that will keep your interest, it's witty enough to cause a chuckle or two and there is nothing remotely ""adult"" about it (other than a running theme of an alcoholic gambler).  It's also very obvious that the movie was made in the 80's on a small, small budget, so don't expect the almost flawless effects you see in kids movies today.  Also, the story is set in America's Frontier Era, so be prepared for some not-so-understanding viewpoints from the characters concerning Native Americans and animal hunting (think ""Little House on the Prairie"" without all the sticky-sweet endings and less crying from Pa).

Here's the story:  An alcoholic, drifting gambler comes across two orphaned kids and their dog trying to travel across Oregon.  Thinking he can con them into giving him some food and shelter from all the people who are after him, he takes up with the kids on their journey and the rest of the movie is devoted to their adventures along the way to their destination (and maybe, just maybe, the drifter comes to form a bond with the orphans...maybe).",1097107200,38,1293,4.7155555555555555
1652540,3,B00005R2D4,"The movie is filled with scenes of wild animals and nature! These are what make the movie worthwhile to watch. I love the outside so this movie can bring that to you if you have been in the house or worked and haven't had the opportunity to surround yourself with nature. I would love to British Columbia and the Uinta Mountains of Utah where this was filmed. The story line is kind of plain and simple. A bank robber who is a professional gambler is on the run. He finds two kids alone trying to make it to Oregon and hooks up with them after many trys to win them over. It is a good kids film! If you like Little House on the Praire, it has similarities. Another movie like this could be The Wilderness Family.

1652555,4,B00005R2D4,"love this movie! Great shots of our Canadian mountain ranges, and an excellent family movie! It's true you either like this movie or hate it, but it's full of great lines from all three major characters. Storyline: (promise no spoilers :-) Zachariah Coop is a gambler on the run when he comes across two stranded kids. Holly and Jason Smith have been abandoned on the trail by a lowdown guide while on their way to inherit a farm and save it from the clenches of their mean old stingy Uncle. After unsuccessfully stealing (really, he was just borrowing :-) their horse, Mr. Coop tries to make peace with the kids. After saving Jason from a watery death the three began their journey together through the pass. Facing bears, wolves, friendly Indians, scoundrels and not just one, but two cougars a long lasting and sure to be interesting friendship is forged! Filled with a memorable soundtrack (the title track will stick with you, believe me) this movie represents some of the better non-Disney flicks around. Plus, Robert Logan at his best - so things happen in three's to him...(for those who don't know, Logan's characters never get into just one mess, but three or four at one time!) The chemistry between Rattray and Logan is very well played out. This would have been a great TV series...",1440374400,,1295,4.734513274336283

1652618,4,B00005R2D4,"I saw this originally in the theater and or on television.  I mixed this up with another movie called Seven Alone (1974) at first about the Sager Orphans.  This one is an enjoyable family story with a never-do-well Irish gambler and two teens and dog Charity who help each other to Oregon.  I just finished it and Robert Logan is easy on the eyes, the older girl has 1970's Laura Ingall's braids, her younger brother is very cute typical boy, and the dog I was wondering at one point when they ran out of bullets if they would have to eat him.  That was probably the only part that really bothered me was how could they not bring enough bullets any of them and then waste them if they knew they were running low.  They got through.  Classic family adventure.  Robert Logan is also known for Wilderness Family movies, which I liked a lot, and this is of the same caliber.",1428624000,,870,4.366459627329193

How could they survive going over a snow covered mountain with only a blanket and nothing to eat/drink?

1652725,5,B00005R2D4,"The acting if good and the stories, although fought with dangers are
realistic to life in the country. If we are to go through life
only living for and watching movies made to please many of those who
prefer the world through a cynic's eye then we are doomed to miss a lot.",1351382400,,273,4.169811320754717
1652726,5,B00005R2D4,"I bought this for my Granddaughter because she is a spunky. independent young girl about the same age as Holly, the heroine of this story. She loved watching the movie and has watched it several times since. Personally, I also enjoyed watching it before I mailed it to her. The story line is that a young girl (age 10-12) and her younger brother (age 7-8) are heading to Oregon in a covered wagon circa 1870. Along the way the grandfather dies leaving the two children to fend for themselves. Holly knows how to handle a rifle and does threaten with it several times. The story would not work without an adult to help them in times that would overwhelm inexperienced children, no matter how independent their personalities. The adult is a down and out lovable scam artist who alienates them by attempting to scam them out of a horse, but later on is invited by Holly to travel with them when he saves them from a potentially lethal situation. If you have or even know a young girl age 8-12 this would be a gift she could enjoy again and again.",1338422400,3,1043,4.465968586387435
1652727,5,B00005R2D4,"Saw this movie years ago.  Still funny and quite enjoyable.  It is whimsical, but kids [and adults] need whimsy in this day and age.  This is a movie that makes your heart feel very good.  Both my sons are now in their 40's, they remember the movie and share it with their children.
There is one other I wish they would bring to DVD: SEA GYPSIES [though originally titled 'SHIPWRECK', it is only available on VHS or 'instant video'.
With both the following movies I mention here I would give more than 5 stars if possible.",1333152000,,522,4.40625

1652740,5,B00005R2D4,"I am so excited I can offer this movie to my mom as a birthday present soon.  She saw the movie over 20 years ago in another country and now cannot stop asking for it.  I am very happy.  I watched it and the image and sound are so perfect.  Love it.  Thank you.

PD:  I don't know if the movie has subtitles in Spanish as my mom does not speak English.  I'm sure she will love it anyway but I would like advise on this subject if it is possible.

Looking forward to do business again in the future.

THANKS",1289347200,2,506,3.9207920792079207

1652744,5,B00005R2D4,"WOW!! What a delight to be able to sit down and watch a movie with my grandchildren and see them enjoy it as much as I did.  Robert Logan as Zachariah Coop was great. Heather (Holly) and Mark (Jason) I thought did a great job of acting.  Coop saving Jason from the river and at the Indian camp were some heartwarming scenes.  The scenery was beautiful and the music was outstanding.  Would like to have seen them make a soundtract.  I have watched this many times by my self and with family.  I thought Robert Logan was great in all his movies, The Wilderness Family 1 & 2 and Mountain Family Robinson. Great Family Movie.",1205884800,3,622,4.3652173913043475
1652745,4,B00005R2D4,"Another great family film and it was the first of four starring Robert Logan who in this film plays the role of Gambler Zachariah Coop, Heather Rattray plays the role of Holly Smith and Mark Edward Hall plays the role of Jason Smith. Coop who's on horse back is running from 6 men who are looking to skin him alive. After Coop loose, his horse he runs into Holly and Jason Smith who's on their way to Oregon. Coop tries to hook up with the kids but they don't trust him. Therefore, Across the Great Divide the kids go with Mr. Coop following them. The Kids deal with many hazards while on their way and the only question that remains, do they make and is Mr. Coop with them. The movie it's self I would give a six however, when you add in the country and its beauty through out the movie then this movie jumps to a 9.
