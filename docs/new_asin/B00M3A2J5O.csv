6554644,4,B00M3A2J5O,"Great depiction of the struggles of being a youth in the inner city of Chicago. I loved that it gave multiple sides of the story, so the viewer could definitely identify with at least one character. The duality of thought for the main characters to do what they knew to be right or do what they needed to do to survive really touches your heart and opens your mind.",1419120000,3,365,4.304347826086956

6554646,5,B00M3A2J5O,"This was a good movie, better than I expected. Theven profanity in this movie was no more or less than most movies so I don't know how someone can say it had too much profanity unless they are living on the moon. When D money mother was saying she keep him in church,  she was lying, plain and simple. It had nothing to do with Calvin. Smh, what planet these people live on?",1485302400,,374,4.123287671232877

6554650,4,B00M3A2J5O,"I enjoyed the movie but was lost at the end. Dennis' mother explained, in the interview with the reporter that her son was in church every Sunday and bible class every Wednesday but I didn't see any of that. The only way I could make sense of that is if Calvin was his brother and she was referring to him. Anyone else???",1484438400,,321,4.193548387096774

8669983,1,B00M3A2J5O,A poorly shot film. Is it me or did anyone that's viewed this movie see any of the actors that are on the cover of the DVD. The actors in the film look older and don't resemble what's on the cover. Just something I saw.,1502841600,,219,3.888888888888889
