1373676,5,B00004YA19,"I've seen every single one of the Land Before Time movies.  Up to number 6, I didn't like any of them but the first one that started them all.  My 5yr old sister on the other hand loves them all. When I found out there was a number 7 out, I was like 'no way, they're still making them'.  but I bought it for my little sister and watched it and now my favorite movies of the Land Before Time series are number 1 and 7.  And yes, my little sister loves it too, no surprise there.  The reason why I like it is because although the storyline may not be any different from the other movies - simple, the difference is that in the movie they make fun of things that have kinda become clich&eacute; thru out the series, that I found entertaining.  Also the singing is better than that one Land Before Time one, where they were singing about a Lone Ranger or something -- that song is hilarious, because it's so stupid.  Although, doesn't anyone wonder when they're gonna have the characters grow up, even a little.",977961600,10,1007,4.268421052631579
1373677,5,B00004YA19,"This sequel in the Land Before Time series features a bit less music that the earlier ones, but the music it has is top-notch. Our friends' characters are again well-developed, and the plot is strong, funny, and heartwarming.  There is less violence in this film and more mystery. Overall, I think it is superior to all but the original LBT movie. Let's hope Universal keeps letting this magical series mature!",976492800,14,410,4.857142857142857
1373678,5,B00004YA19,"Unlike other children's movie sequels I have seen, The Land Before Time movies each have very interesting and fun plotlines.  This newest additon is no different.  The consistency of characters and wholesome message really appeal to my four and a half year old.  We have only had the video for a week and she has already watched it four times.  My infant also loves the bright colors and cute voices.  I just finished ordering another copy for my nephew and would definitely recommend this movie!",976147200,16,496,4.788235294117647

1373711,5,B00004YA19,"Absolutely brilliant movie. I've seen it too many times to count over the years and it is definitely one of my favorite films. What it teaches and hints at... is just profound. This children's movie seamlessly teaches about false prophets, secret knowledge and access, curiosity, the importance of cooperation and peace, dualism, introspection, interdependence, ego, and reverence of the universe. I don't call it brilliant lightly... and the ending is just too beautiful. If you're not sure about playing it for your child, please do. It's even a seven, a very important seven.",1420329600,,578,5.225806451612903

My two favorite songs from this movie are beyond the mysterious beyond and good inside. It is a very good addition to any little kids or even grown ups land before time collection.

1373770,4,B00004YA19,I ordered this for my 12 year old son and wasn't too sure what the quality of it would be. Well it was in excellent condition and arrived quickly. I have nothing but cudo's for the seller.,1312934400,,188,4.108108108108108
1373771,3,B00004YA19,"I bought this movie because my son has become obsessed with Land before Time. I got tired of watching the same 2 over and over again so I ordered about 5 different one. Since now I have about 7 and watch them VERY frequently I have noticed a pattern with these.
First of all none of them have compared to the first which is by far my favorite for several reasons. The main reason being that it is one of the only ones where the kids get seperated from their families and they search to go home. In EVERY other movie I own the kids run of on their on there own without their parents!!! This drives me crazy! There are great morals in most of these stories but the fact that nearly every movie they run off behind their parents back annoys me to no end. What kind of message does that send our kids?? Well the parents no want to don't go after the stone of cold fire, but we should go anyways!?!?!
Besides running off on their parents yet again the other thing that I do not like is that quit frankly I find the story a bit chessy. The movies seem to get alittle worse/chessier the longer they go on. But that is my opinion...
I do think that some of the music in this one was decent in comparison to some others.",1288828800,,1211,4.113924050632911
1373772,5,B00004YA19,The land before timeVII was a very good kids movie but you would enjoy watching it also with your child or children.,1262995200,,116,4.318181818181818

1373786,1,B00004YA19,"The original LBT was the ONLY good one. That awful habbit of singing every 5 min has GOT to go! & 3D animation may be ""new"" & ""in"" but it looks like ""crap"" mixed with cell. Much like Disney, Universal Studious is more interested in spewing out animation of poor quality in a rush for profits. They've lost their integrity of quality entertainment. Plus it's torture having to watch it if you're over 13.",1072656000,4,403,4.45945945945946
1373787,2,B00004YA19,"For parents:
Compared to the other ""Land Before Time"" movies (we haven't seen the newest one), this is the worst. The production values are good for a direct to video release, but the content is shallow. The uncle pterosaur is just mean and his later redemption is lame. As usual, the dino kids' impulses put them in danger. Very very predictable with nothing whatsoever for the parents. Makes a good babysitter, at least for the first viewing.
For kids:
It's another ""Land Before Time"", so if you haven't seen it then what else matters? Warning: there are singing dinosaurs, but you can fast forward those parts.",1041638400,2,613,4.7924528301886795
1373788,4,B00004YA19,All of the Land Before Time movies are wonderful.  They teach children valuable lessons and our son really enjoys going on these journeys with these cute dinosaurs.  He sits for hours watching this.  This particular video is very cute but not as good as the first movie.,1011139200,2,270,4.702127659574468
1373789,5,B00004YA19,"I think this is the best in the whole serie of these eight cartoons with Littlefoot and his pals, but nothing can beat the first and original movie from 1988 of course.
'The Land Before Time 7' has only three songs (That are the three best in the whole serie), the history is more mysterious (Alien dinos, and a cold stone from outer space), and is therefore a little more different from the other six movies.
This is a movie that seems to have loaned scenes from different movies like 'Cliffhanger'.
I can't wait for 'LBFT 8', and I hope, last movie with Littlefoot and his pals! (If they continue with part nine, and so on, it's problably gonna end the wrong way!)
At last I say, all 'The Land Before Time' movies has always something useful to learn kids, just like frinedship, the place in our life, and the mysteries of the infinite universe.",1002585600,5,847,4.470967741935484
1373790,2,B00004YA19,"My three year old loves all of this series, but for parents, a warning: this is a particularly annoying entry. I find Petrie's blind devotion to his uncle grating and his uncle Ptynaro (or however you spell it) extremely tiring.

The Stone of Cold Fire was a fascinating story about a search for what is thought to be a magical stone which fell from the sky. There are self-seeking flyers led by Pterano who seek the power for themselves, but are thwarted by the youngsters.

Littlefoot and company are guided whether they know or not  by two mysterious rainbow faced creatures, who lead them to bravery and  adventure. It is  well worth watching.",1469145600,,530,4.489583333333333
