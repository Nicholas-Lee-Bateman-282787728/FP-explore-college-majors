8612424,5,B00F5BGQTS,"Moving, revealing, utterly satisfying account of the formation of the Juilliard String Quartet as told by its first violinist, Robert Mann, who played with them for 51 years - he was 93 when this movie was made - and was a teacher and an inspiration for many other leading chamber ensembles. There is a lot of wonderful music, though nothing is played all the way through, by the Juilliard and others. Most enjoyable, I cannot recommend it too highly.",1445212800,,451,4.7215189873417724

8612427,4,B00F5BGQTS,"""Speak the Music"" is a lovely tribute to the original first violinist of the renowned Juilliard String Quartet.  Robert Mann spent a lifetime bringing the great quartets of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Shostakovich, Bartok, etc. to the world, and concurrently bringing his knowledge and joy of music to hundreds of students.  An unlikely choice for the position, he spent his younger years, at his own admission, finding ways to not practice.  But, after assuming (or almost falling into) the position with the Juilliard, his submersion into this great repertoire pulls his career in that direction, and he realizes he is ideally suited for, and is passionate about, the work.  There are some wonderful scenes of performance in the movie, and of Mr. Mann teaching.  The title refers to his philosophy of using music to tell a vivid story: don't play it, speak it, and your audience will understand what you're trying to say.",1438819200,3,921,5.032894736842105
8612428,2,B00F5BGQTS,"I usually love this kind of thing,but this was somehow lackluster, not terribly interesting and didn't really delve very deeply into the musical mind of Robert Mann.",1428019200,,165,5.148148148148148
8612429,5,B00F5BGQTS,"The DVD, Speak the Music, filmed by Allan Miller should fascinate any chamber music player. The historical footage is so well-mastered and the sound is so good that it seems to have been recorded yesterday. But the best parts are the excerpts from master classes and rehearsals. You see Mr Mann simply pouring energy and knowledge into the students. At one point, Mr. Mann stops the quartet and tells a young violist, ""You're a nice guy, I can tell."" The violist smiles. Then he mischievously adds, ""That's not a compliment! You need to force the second violin to play out over you.""
Allan Miller started his career as a musician, and was a conductor himself in his early years. He is extraordinarily sensitive to the music and the story he is telling about the musicians, their histories, and the meaning of the music.
