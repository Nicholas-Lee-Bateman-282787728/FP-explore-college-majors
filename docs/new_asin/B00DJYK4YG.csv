8593984,3,B00DJYK4YG,"Some stories are repeated in the show. That's silly. Also I think that the ""story teller"" is as dull as could be.

Still, the stories are interesting enough, so if you do like ghost stories, give this show a watch. Just don't expect anything too incredible.",1527638400,,257,4.586956521739131
8593985,2,B00DJYK4YG,"The ghost stories were okay but the DVD stated ""Special Features"" and there weren't any so not sure what that was about",1521763200,,119,4.454545454545454
8593986,5,B00DJYK4YG,I thought it was great. These are stories I haven't heard before and they had people share their experiences. I truly enjoyed it!,1517875200,,129,4.6521739130434785
8593987,2,B00DJYK4YG,"If I see another ""account"" of Waverley Hills investigation I would throw up. There are dozens of them floating on line, and NONE of them really have any evidence attached to the hearsay of ""witnesses"". I do not believe that building is haunted, what I think is all the rumors are generated deliberately to promote interest and, perhaps, some income for the owner. Not a bad idea. I own a 110 year old ""Victorian"" house, with turrets and all,  creepy basement and spooky attic, not a hundred feet from an old Catholic cemetery; the house IS NOT haunted. It has been a rental property for the last 10 years. Maybe I should throw out tenants and start running ghost tours out there :) It definitely would look the part, especially in the dark...",1516492800,3,742,4.578947368421052
8593988,5,B00DJYK4YG,"I can't tell if the ""witnesses"" are regular people trying to tell a lie or just bad actors. I love haunted shows with cheesy community-theater-caliber reenactments (complete with questionable period costumes), embroidered urban legends, and mediums in blazers. Less interested in ""investigators"" roaming around with modified stud finders.",1516147200,,338,6.0625

8593991,2,B00DJYK4YG,"Yawn, the stories are repetitious and traditional lore, many can be found in hundreds of ghost stories or variation thereof.",1383436800,,124,5.25
