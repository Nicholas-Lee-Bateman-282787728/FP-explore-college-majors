8064959,5,B0009PVZ3W,"This is one of those few Diamond-in-the-Rough documentaries. The filmmakers manage to get interviews with Bingo hall workers, retirees smoking endless cigarettes, and all manner of excentric Bingo players. The film also covers Bingo played in other countrie. There is some really interesting footage captured of a kitchy British resort where Bingo is played in enormous stadium facilities. While I didn't necessarily feel like playing Bingo after this doc, I did find myself making mental note of all the Bingo halls I pass. Bingo clearly draws the most ecclectic group of participants than any other pasttime.",1363132800,,610,5.364583333333333
8064960,5,B0009PVZ3W,"Both for entertainment and as a problem gambling counselor I found this documentary to be very entertaining and informational.
In the counseling field this type of hypnotizing form of gambling is more popular with women. I have been in touch withh the director and if he comes to the east coast I would love to have him talk to our clients.
It's a great documentary.",1208736000,,366,4.6461538461538465
8064961,3,B0009PVZ3W,"Bingo is an interesting movie, but kinda gets boring after a while. It's interesting to see people's addiction to the game, and how the myth of it being an after church - old person's game being busted, but I wanted more from the movie. Also the DVD says it's 88 minutes, but in reality it's about an hour.",1126656000,,306,4.293103448275862
