8324627,3,7798926763,"While Chen Qingzhou's skill level is obviously high, the video is more of a demonstration rather than instruction. Those expecting instruction will likely largely be disappointed. The video shows a little of what he does with the unique stick - different from other stick practices - and attempts to show how that practice is related to practical usage in joint locking and martial push hands. I suspect those viewing the video who do not already know what he is demonstrating will not understand much of what he is doing and attempting to explain. However, as far as I'm aware, this is the only commercially available video that shows CQZ's stick practice. For those who have learned the practice directly from him, the video may serve as a useful review of that material. For others, I suspect that it will not provide great insight into the practice.",1358899200,2,853,4.8493150684931505
