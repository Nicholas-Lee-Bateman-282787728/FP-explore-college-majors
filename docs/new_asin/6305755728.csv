7894142,5,6305755728,"Ok...this one is a little too strong for the kidies to watch. COVER THE EYES OF THE INNOCENT CHILDREN! ._. Anyway, in this episode, Harry and Ron MacDougal try to kidnap Melfina and steal the Outlaw Star to go to the Galactic Layline. Harry, when he cannot convice Melfina to go with him, uses brute force and ends up punching her until she blacks out, awakening over his shoulder. She fights him and....well....get the movie if you want to know more. ^_~",1053993600,,455,4.560975609756097

7894145,5,6305755728,"Yes, after some cybernetic repairs to Harry's arm, the MacDougal Brothers are back. First, Gene meets with Ron MacDougal at a fancy restraunt. Ron explains that the reason they killed Hilda was that it was ordered by the Space Force. After Gene, Suzuka, Jim and Aisha duke it out with Ron's little robotic lions, Ron unvails his very own caster! Gene escapes and heads towards the space port. Meanwhile, Harry tries to better know Melfina. Its hard to tell if hes in love with her or not, but Harry does reveal that he is exactly same as Melfina and mentions that their birth was that of being born in a tube. Melfina thwarts off Harry through the navigation system and the Outlaw Star escapes again. Next up, get ready to RUMBLE! The second episode is a wrestling match. Fred wants Gene to compete and beat Rei Ko, a girl who wants to marry Fred if she'll win. But you know Fred. So he puts Gene in drag and sends him in. One of the main characters who is focused on in this episode is Aisha who pits herself against another C'trl C'trl in her white wolf form. They also get a call from Fred that he wants to congratuate Gene by giving him money on his planet. So the Outlaw Star, for once, takes off for money. The action was great and Aisha wrestling outfit has got to be a parody of Catwomen. I really liked the design of Ron's cool caster which is very flashy. If your following the story, you need to see this volume. It packs some big events. But like all volumes, you have to see every volume because Outlaw Star follows a story and is sometimes episodic, but sometimes not (namely the first two volumes. So get this and continue to watch as this clever series will amaze anyone who watches it.",981504000,,1702,4.37223974763407
