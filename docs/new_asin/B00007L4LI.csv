Afterall, characters are what you watch for in shows that keeps you coming back for more. This serie is definately targeted at a younger audience than most animes. However, even though it's light and funny toned there are some seriousness to it, like Kai's past and evil scientists themes.
As for audience gender, this serie would most likely attract boys for the combat nature and lack of more female characters (ok, there are only 3 worth mentioning, Mariah, Hiliray, and Salima). But girls may be attracted to the (again) cute boy characters.",1079222400,,690,4.710743801652892
1819405,4,B00007L4LI,"While its true that this show is nothing but a shameless plug to brainwash unsuspecting kids into buying the extensive line of toys for this series (the toys actually came first before the anime and the toys only took off when the show started airing in Japan), I am not ashamed to say that I enjoy watching it ^.^;;;
As someone who's a huge fan of X and Senkaiden Houshin Engi I'm sure this is probably strange if not sacrilegious, but hey--you gotta lighten up every now and then and beyblade, while not having the greatest plot in the world (hey, who am I kidding--what plot?) still sets out what it intended to do in the first place--and that is to entertain people, which it does.
And to give it credit, the characters are cute and quite lovable. Rei and Kai are reasons enough for me to keep on watching this series till the end.",1058486400,3,835,4.393548387096774

7977951,2,B00007L4LI,Not a high quality cartoon.  The animation is not good and the content is very simplistic and aggressive.  Do not recommend.,1371772800,,124,4.857142857142857
7977952,5,B00007L4LI,I choose this because my grandson enjoys watching  and teachers him new tricks with his own beyblades. He enjoys the movie,1370908800,,122,4.809523809523809

7977954,5,B00007L4LI,"Grandson loves this rip roaring action packed film which features challenges, revenge and discovering powers. This is one of the hottest shows among 6-12 boys",1363737600,,158,5.36
7977955,4,B00007L4LI,"The animation in season one is pretty poor but I love the characters and storyline in this show. It keeps me interested and never gets boring. Sure parts are unrealistic and weird, but its a cartoon. If it made sense it would be boring",1361059200,,235,4.363636363636363
7977956,4,B00007L4LI,"I don't know what people find it wrong with this show. But personally... I love it! I love it! I love it! And this is a fair warning, this review kinda covers the whole first season to which this particular DVD is just the first.
Sure it maybe about spinning tops. But c'mon, in game gimmick animes, cards and electronic geegaws are so mainstream, they became boring. Atleast for me. Beyblade brings a nice new spin on game anime, pardon the pun.
I love the characters! For me, I can see the great divercity in all of the characters, and I have found some characters who show up a little later (not in this DVD, but later in the series, which I have watched in whole) plainly hilarious! Who wouldn't find Max's antics even a little funny?
The plot may have it's loop holes, but what anime doesn't? I don't want to go too in depth about the plot in fear of spoiling it for you. But the plot is a bit more than spinning tops and tournaments, and in the the end of the first season it does get a little dark and somewhat disturbing. I dare anyone here to go over a poisonous snake pit on monkey bars. (The end of the season will explain that one)
Kids in the family will LOVE this. But it may not be exactly for the very young viewers (no one younger than 9 or 8), as it does get a little dark at times.
If you're over 9 and maybe seen the dub, you don't know what you're missing. The dub cut out all the good stuff to be honest. And I'm proud to say that I'm glad my 12 year old cousin got me into this series.
It's a well-worth item for pre-teens, and maybe even for family viewing. And I have a feeling girls will love this one just as much as boys. Though maybe for different reasons.",1091577600,9,1685,4.124620060790273
7977957,4,B00007L4LI,"Now... I don't know what that other person down there was ranting on about how Beyblade is childish, stupid, blah blah blah... Right.
You see... those are the kinds of people that maybe watch 5 mins of it, come to the conclusion that the show is meant for people with the mentality of a banana, and then go and rant. They don't appreciate the story, the characters, whatever.
Now the concept may be a bit... odd. Spinning tops. Alot of people think that the game originated from the show. Wrong. Show came after manga came after game. Top came first. Manga created by Aoki Takao. Manga adapted to TV show by d-Rights. Aired on TV-TOKYO in 2001. Yeah... it's an uberly long commercial for a toy line that's been around since 1996. But it still rocks.
The story revolves around a 10-year-old boy named Kinomiya Takao (or 13-year-old named Tyson Granger according to the dub >>;) that is a beyblader. He has been beyblading practically his entire life, ever since his older brother started when he was Takao's age. That, and he manages to do kendo as well. =P
I'd go on, but that's too much to type. Later on you get introduced to the rest of the main characters -- the enigmatic Hiwatari Kai, kitty-boi Kon Rei, and the hyper cutie Mizuhara Max.
For a show about spinning tops, it's gained some older fans too (like me ^_~). I'd watch it if I were you.",1082937600,5,1350,4.491869918699187
