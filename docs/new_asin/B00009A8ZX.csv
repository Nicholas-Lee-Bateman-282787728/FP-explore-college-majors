1881566,2,B00009A8ZX,"I just received this DVD and can't really give it a content rating yet.  I did want to chime in regarding the difficulty of using this DVD.

Several reviewers have mentioned that they  couldn't pause, rewind or fast forward their DVD, while others have said their DVD didn't have ""chapter"" markers, and at least one person claimed their DVD ""worked perfectly"".  My copy of this DVD will move through chapters, but will not pause, rewind or fast forward.

So, although the recording quality of the DVD seems acceptable, the functionality of the DVD is very poor and will probably result in an overall lower rating than I might have given it if it wasn't such a struggle to maneuver through the lessons.

If I manage to make it to the end of the DVD despite my current frustration, I will post another rating for content.",1111363200,32,819,4.613793103448276
1881567,3,B00009A8ZX,"Ask yourself two questions:
Question One: Do you want to play classical piano on a world stage?
Question Two: Do you want to play piano in your own home for your own entertainment?
If your answer to the first question is ""yes,"" then this book is not for you. And Mr. Houston says as much on several occasions in both the book and the video.
It seems that those reviews that express a strong negative opinion of this work, start with the assumption that one should only answer ""yes"" to the first question and one should never approach music in the spirit of the second.
People considering this work should ask themselves specifically what their goal is.
If your answer to the second question is ""yes,"" then this work will spend half of its energy overcoming any reservation you might have about your ability to play the piano for personal enjoyment.
In this work, Mr. Houston has to battle in two directions.
One, he has to overcome the ""piano anxiety"" that people accrue as the result of years of taking lessons in a style of teaching that prepares the student to answer ""yes"" to question one.
Two, once he has cleared away assumptions learned from ""classical"" piano lessons, he demonstrates an approach to piano playing that is easier to implement then it is to explain. I don't think one should fault Mr. Houston simply because his method is easy to implement, once you understand it.
It is true that Mr. Houston does not outline a complicated and intricate regimen that explains the many aspects of music. That is not his goal. Rather he wishes to put the individual at a keyboard with music that can be learned as rapidly as possible. And if you diligently follow his advice you will soon find yourself making music at a keyboard that most people enjoy and find fulfilling.
However, it will take effort on your part, a fact which Mr. Houston underscores several times.
I found I was very satisfied with this program. In addition to the book, I purchased the VHS version of the video (and now wish I had purchased the DVD as I would be able to read the music better and digitally zoom in on Mr. Houstons fingers at the key board).
I also purchased the ""Snarling Dogs"" chord finder and found it to be very helpful in figuring out such arcane symbols as ""D7dim"" etc.
I purchased a fake book, ""Your First Fake Book"" and found that I needed to work at a piece about an hour per day for two weeks before I became proficient. But I would add that I did not know any of the chords. I've also found that the chords from the first song show up with a good deal of regularity in most of the others.
Mr. Houston asks a pertinent question, ""would you rather learn hundreds of chords in the abstract or would you rather learn five or six chords and play your favorite song?""
I know that this system has worked for me, given my goals and I know which way I would prefer to learn chords.
I also have a high-speed Internet connection and did not purchase the CD (which has exapmles of blues styles and other examples), but rather I downloaded the Mp3 files that Mr. Houston provides at his web site, free of charge.
If one expects to work on a daily basis for one's own entertainment, this particular package will do very nicely.",1077753600,280,3216,4.480408858603067
1881568,4,B00009A8ZX,"After spending hundreds of dollars buying a keyboard and midi equipment as well as PC learning software to try to learn to play the piano and being frustrated with the program and process, I picked up Scotts dvd after seeing him on PBS and I have to say I've learned more in 1 day than I did in the months I tried fiddling with the PC learning software. Scott makes it so simple, breaking it down and not making it feel like a chore. I would also recommend people getting his book to accompany the dvd, the content in the dvd is great as is the quality, I just wish there was a chapter break down so I can skip easily to parts I want to see rather than fast fowarding or rewinding over and over. It's split up into 2 sections, the first section was show on PBS while the 2nd section is new, with a lot of more content as well as ""cheap tricks"" to make you sound like a pro, which I LOVE. It's been 3 days since I got the DVD and I can play 3 of my favorite songs.
I recommend it highly!",1071360000,256,986,3.984848484848485
1881569,1,B00009A8ZX,"I purchased the authors book, same title, and found it to be less than informative, so... after reading a review of the author's DVD, and how difficult it is to watch and play along, I decided the video set (doesn't ""set"" imply more than one of something?)would be better, as I could rewind and review easily. The information contained was available free on PBS, and the additional 80 minutes claimed seems to be a reselling  of how his system teaches.
The video is a low quality recording and certainly not worth the money.",1067212800,134,524,4.634408602150538
1881570,3,B00009A8ZX,"The Instructor is great!  He does a good job of explaining how his method of instruction is what a student wants to learn.  I was glued to the DVD, learining as I went along....until I had to answer the phone.  The DVD does not allow you to pause, forward or even rewind!!! I think that is a major shortfall for an ""instructional"" DVD!  How do I go back to a tip I missed!!!How do I pause for a minute?  The whole reason that I could not take lessons was because there are times when you need to answer phones, go to the restroom, etc...I mean most of us don't take lessons because we don't have the time, right? Well I couldn't spend my whole day watching the entire DVD over and over again, going over points that I have already learned and played...In short: A good instructor and good material, but the DVD makes it impossible to sit through it all.  But if you are determined to learn, and give a whole 2 hours of your undivided attention (no answering phones, no bathroom breaks, no lifting your eyes off the screen or keyboard) you might just learn about the joys of playing the Piano by ear.",1061251200,39,1099,4.310679611650485
1881571,2,B00009A8ZX,"Well, the most I can say is that it will teach you a few tricks for playing chords along with a simple melody line, like found in fake books. Scott is a slick performer and he makes his examples sound good, but his method is adaptable to only a limited style and tempo of playing. This DVD is a companion to his book of the same title. Both the book and the DVD are overpriced for what they contain, in my opinion. A much better choice would be ""How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons"", also available from Amazon.",1058313600,189,522,4.178217821782178
1881572,5,B00009A8ZX,"I have played piano ""by ear"" for many many years, but have always found reading left hand notes difficult, and this has led me to be defensive about my playing. But Scott's video made me realize that what I am doing is not wrong. I play for my own enjoyment and for how I feel at the moment. He demonstrated  many chord patterns that I have been playing by ear, but couldn't have explained why. The blues section is a totally new area for me, and his explanation of the 6 note blues scale is one I am finding fun to ""noodle"" around with. One of my sons, who has no piano experience, watched the video and he was able to play something right away. I do think it might take a novice a bit longer than Scott claims, but if someone really wants to have fun and forget about reading notes, this method should definitely get them off on the ""right note""!",1057017600,123,848,4.2024539877300615

I like the way his shows the chords and the fact that you can play the individual notes within the chord to jazz it up a little bite.  However, he takes a long time to even play a simply song.  I watched his video for a while, but my wife wanted me to turn him off.  I had original bought it for her to learn to play the piano.  I already know how to play the piano, but thought that she would like lessons from someone else.

1881660,5,B00009A8ZX,"Scotts method of lead sheet playing is exactly the way I've played keys in all the different club bands that I've played in over the last 30 years.
If you just want to play piano (or keyboards) but don't want to spend the years it takes to learn to do it in the classical style, this is a great starting point DVD.",1370995200,3,314,4.080645161290323
1881661,3,B00009A8ZX,"I recently bought the 2013 4-disc  set of Play Piano in a Flash at a big box store for a little more than half the price this 2009 version is selling for. I don't know why Amazon doesn't sell it yet. It is available on other online sites for about the same as  this version costs. I uploaded a pic of the front and back covers of the 4 disc 2013 version. It's a red and white box with a black grand piano and stool on the cover, and Scott's face in a little 2 inch square. The 4 discs have a total of 8 hours of info.

I believe the first of the 4 discs on the 2013 version might be what's in this older 2009 version. Part one of the first disc is the PBS lecture, which is 99% inspiration and one percent information. Basically Scott tells you to play the C F and G chords with your left hand and play the sheet music melody notes with your right hand.  There's one big problem with this. Sight reading (or memorizing)and playing the melody line with the right hand while playing chords with your left is the hard part. You will not learn to do that in a flash, unless you are playing Mary had a Little Lamb. At this point, Scott's method just became the same method as every beginner piano book ever written.

But don't despair. You are much better off singing the words to songs you already know (the words are what the melody is) and playing just the chords with your right hand. Later on, if you want to, you can throw in a bass note or pattern with your left hand. That's what I did after hearing Scott's lecture on PBS a few years ago. And I've been doing it ever since. I find guitar chords and words to a song I like online. There are many guitar chord/tab websites, with nearly every pop song ever written available for free.  I transpose the chords to the song to the key of C (many guitar tab/chord sites transpose the music for you to any key). The key of C is the easiest to play as the majority of major and minor chords in that key will be on the white keys.  I play the chords on my keyboard and sing along. I use online piano chord dictionaries to learn the chords I don't know. With a keyboard, if the melodies are out of my range, I can let the keyboard raise or lower the key, but I'm still playing the music in the key of C. The major advantage of singing and playing (even if you don't have a great voice) is that singing forces you to pace the song correctly. You can't sing ...Happy Biiiiiiiiiirthday toyou... but you can easily play that way. Singing forces you to pace the chord changes correctly.

The second part of the first DVD has a bunch of fairly useful tricks. This is why I gave this DVD 3 stars instead of 1. The 4 disc 2013 version adds three additional discs of tricks. Scott must have realized that the tricks were the only really useful part of the instruction.",1366588800,25,2802,4.156826568265683

1881683,3,B00009A8ZX,"Before watching the video, I already knew how to read music and I knew the names of the keys on the piano; therefore, I have a head start over someone just starting out.

Scott Houston teaches some very simple but important concepts for learning to play piano quickly and make it really sound good. I did not understand how chords work or how to find out what notes are in a particular chord. He cleared that up.

The drawbacks on the video are serious. He probably only teaches no more than 10 different concepts, but he talks A LOT and that just drags the video on. I was appalled when, 20-30 minutes into the video, he still had not said, ""Ok, let's play.""

He also plays and performs for his audience more than what's necessary to make his points, but I didn't buy the VHS to hear HIM play. I want to play.

While he has a charming personality, he should talk and play less, then include some practice exercises for his viewers to do. He should say, ""Now you try it. Look at this line of music and play it on your own piano...[pause]...it should've have sounded like this..."" And then he plays the correct answer.

So, I'll find my own music, fast forward to the parts where he is actually teaching something, then pause and practice after each concept.",1361750400,30,1257,4.424242424242424

1881685,5,B00009A8ZX,"I have a very good friend who has a young daughter who is interested in learning to play the piano.

1881686,5,B00009A8ZX,"I am retired, 71 years old and never played a note. I purchased
both Scott Houston's DVDs - Play Piano In A Flash and Play Piano
In A Flash 3.  If I can learn how to play the piano then so can you.
You will be pleasantly surprised as to what a little practice can
do and before long you will be playing your first tune.

Do you want to learn how to play piano like classic style music -
Both DVDs are not for you.

Do you want to learn how to play the piano and have fun
at the same time then continue to read below.

This review will be used for both DVDs.  Both DVDs are informative
and contain much duplicate references.  I found Play Piano In A
Flash to concentrate more on the technical aspect of piano playing.
Play Piano In A Flash 3 seems to highlight the ""fun"" aspect of
learning how to play in 3 easy steps. Step 1 is Learn Chords To
Your Song, Step 2 is Learn Melody Line and Step 3 is Put Your Hands
Together And Play Your Tune!

Which DVD should you buy if you can only afford one?
I would choose Play Piano In A Flash 3.  Very much the same
as Playing Piano In a Flash and it cost about $20.00 less.

Silent Night is used as the learning song for both DVDs.  Scott
will take you thru a few extra songs in Piano In A Flash 3.

So come on Couch Potatoes - get off that couch and start learning
to play the piano. Above all have fun!

Listed below are the chapters for both DVDs to give you an idea
of what areas Scoot addresses in this endeavor for you to learn
how to play the piano.

DVD and in just 2 weeks i could play 4 songs including Elton John, Bob Dylan and the theme from ""Cheers"". Now, understand that these products are just tools you use to get started. It takes a real passion and desire to play to make them effective, but if you stick to the basics (learn the chords, learn the melody, put them together) you WILL start playing quickly.

I found that the DVD had more actual instruction, where the book seemed more motivational, but hey, what's wrong with motivation if it gets the job done.

Long story short, I would recommend Scotts program (book and DVD) to anybody starting out.

His approach and style make learning to play using chords and lead sheets (no bass cleft) fun and non-threatening. Eight week classes, one night a week, are offered at specific locations which have a trained local teacher to help you master all the stuff that he makes look super easy. Be prepared to PRACTICE a lot to make it easy for you to do.

1881724,5,B00009A8ZX,"Experiment 6/2/09 - I just saw Play Piano In A Flash on PBS last night for the first time.  I am giving it five stars right now because Scott's show has motivated me to take up the piano again.

I am 40. I took piano lessons for a couple of years when I was in grade school but other than a few failed attempts to play it since then I have stayed away from it.  I always longed to play the piano for fun but I just wouldn't stick with it because it was too frustrating to me.

After seeing Scott's show last night, I am going to purchase his book and a digital keyboard and give it another shot.  Why?  Because he said that I can play the piano just for the love of it and it doesn't matter what fingers I use to play certain chords or anything.  He said that I can play songs that I want to play instead of practicing all of these other songs that put me to sleep.  It was really an Ah-ha moment for me.

I always loved it when my grandfather would just sit down and play the piano.  Was he good? Not really.  Did we have fun singing songs? You bet! The memories I have of those times mean a lot to me.  And that is all that I want to be able to do with my children, my family, and my friends.....have fun and make memories.

I think of it this way.....when we were kids we played baseball.  Well, kind of anyway.  We used trees and frisbees for the bases and somebody's glove was usually home plate.  We used tennis balls instead of baseballs.  If you threw the ball and hit a runner when he wasn't on base that person was out.  Now, were those the types of equipment and rules that professionals play by? No, not even close.  Was it fun? You bet.

So, Scott's way my not be the ""correct"" way to play, but I think that it is going to be fun.  I will report back on my progress once I have actually started playing.",1243900800,4,1816,4.002785515320334

The philosophy of this program is to learn to play your favorites songs just for the enjoyment of playing the piano.  This course is not for those aspiring to be concert pianists.

It wasn't until I purchased these DVDs in 2004 that I finally got it.  With his tips and tricks, along with the advice given by his guests on the show, my piano playing ability was launched from ""chop sticks"" to ""Clocks"" by Coldplay.

I only wish that the show focused more on some tips for the next step once these tips had been mastered.  For that I recommend the Play Like Me series also offered here at Amazon.",1243296000,11,786,4.492957746478873
1881726,5,B00009A8ZX,"I bought Scott's DVD shortly after watching the first part on PBS on a whim. I really appreciated Scott's style and lessons. When I first started watching this program, I was just a guitar player with absolutely no piano experience and very little sheet music experience. I had no idea how to locate notes on the piano. After watching the DVD, I started practicing and playing through some lead sheets of church music I had and was amazed at how quickly I could pick it up from just the pointers Scott gave.

Maybe there's a better system out there and maybe this DVD is even weak on content as other people seem to imply -- this is the only DVD on the piano I've ever purchased so I have nothing to compare it too -- but for me personally, the DVD was very much worth the money. In less than 5 hours of practice I was playing through some of favorite church pieces. Yeah, I was flubbing a lot of notes, but the songs were still coming through. One of my friends was listening to me play one day and asked how many ""months"" I had been taking lessons. ""I think I'm up to 10 hours now!"", I laughed. I'm NOT a gifted a musician, yet this DVD was able to open up the piano for me and in turn my guitar playing has also improved.",1240272000,5,1224,4.186440677966102
1881727,5,B00009A8ZX,"Scott has come up with a piano method for those who want to play their favorite non-classical tunes, as an Instructional Designer it is intriguing to see the simplicity to remove many learning obstacles with the intent that you will practice while you play your favorite music. There is an axiom that says ""whats learned with pleasure is learned full measure."" This is a great example of how to have fun playing the piano quickly.",1238457600,,430,4.746666666666667
1881728,1,B00009A8ZX,I learned nothing from the DVD or the Book that I already knew.  He does too much talking and doesn't cover hardly anything.  I don't even think it would benefit beginners.,1207353600,7,172,4.516129032258065
1881729,2,B00009A8ZX,"This DVD is pretty much verbatim from the book of the same title. In other words, there is very little substantive content. Houston is a marketer of hope and dreams, not an instructor of the keyboards. The mantra of ""play chords with your left hand, and melody with the right"" will get you nowhere. Get a good book and take your time. Playing piano is not easy; it requires practice. Houston would have you believe that you can play like a pro. Don't fall for it.",1202688000,8,463,4.395348837209302
1881730,5,B00009A8ZX,"only play the piano to pick out notes for the song or aria and used a metronome for timing. I was thrilled to see how Houston could simplify the playing of a popular song and memorizing the chords for the left hand.  I taped the program, and later bought the more complete VHS version of the TV program.

A niece, who was busy but made a half hearted attempt to learn to play the piano, gave me the book she had been using, ""How to Play Popular Piano in 10 Easy Lessons"" by Norman Monath.  Using the theory that Houston taught, I used the Monath book as exercises for playing sample songs such as ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" advancing to ""Autumn Leaves."" This gave me practice in learning new chords as I progressed.

By this time, I did buy Houston's book, ""Play Piano in a Flash!""  Was I disappointed?  I have to say I was, because Ihad progressed beyond the book.

The next book I was to learn from was ""How to play the piano despite years of lessons"" by Ward Cannel and Fred Marx.""  From this book I was to learn much including how to choose chords (from progressions on the circle - elementary classical harmony) and arrange a song after picking out notes of a song I knew by ear.

I was shocked to realize, upon looking into old cartons in the cellar, I had purchased this Cannel and Marx book  years and years before, and found it too difficult to understand.  However, with what I had learned from Scott Houston,  the Cannel and Marx book suddenly became clear.  Without Scott Houston, I would never have been able to play popular music.

I have purchased Houston's many additional DVDs: four volumes of ""Cheap Tricks and Professional Secrets"", book examples  of his Audio CD.  Am I a talented pianist?  Absolutely not!  But the joy and pleasure of sitting down and playing tunes on the piano is something I shall always credit to Houston.",1196812800,44,1849,4.485029940119761
1881731,1,B00009A8ZX,"There are many issues with the content. Scott would like you to believe that playing the piano is much easier than it really is. The message is play what you like and you will have fun. And so he goes on to playing Amazing Grace. How many people will have a blast playing one note to the beat Amazing Grace, with no harmonics whatsoever?

He would also like the audience to believe that music theory is plain useless, that classically trained player have been learning all of these scales for no reason. Well some theory certainly is useless. But you need a bare minimum. You need at least enough to be able to construct chords.

There is a part that keeps you somewhat entertained. It's what he calls cheap tricks. That's a good way to have fun for a little while. He will show you how to play a simple C Major arpeggio. That's fair. Unfortunately, he falls short of showing you how to use it in a tune. It shows you it can be used, but he doesn't show how...

Perhaps most disappointing, he will show you how if you listen to him, you can play a tune just like him. He picks Misty, a nice Erroll Garner's ballad. Beautiful tune. And slow, so you might be fooled into thinking what he does is easy, and you have the appropriate skills already. He even uses his cheap tricks. How nice. Unfortunately, he only taught you 2 chords, C major and F major. You have no clue what he's really doing there. Not only that but he re-harmonizes quite a lot, alters chord beautifully. He can play, no doubt about it. But I guarantee there's a lot more theory to what he plays than what he'd like the audience to believe.

I seriously doubt anyone will be able to start playing piano after sitting and listening to Scott's lessons. I don't even think you'll be entertained watching the video. It's that bad. He just talks too much.

If you are serious about playing the piano, get yourself a good teacher, one that will understand how to teach adults. The cheaper option is to pick up something like ""how to play from a fake book"" and start discovering music.",1173830400,51,2045,4.3994708994708995

1881733,1,B00009A8ZX,"I wanted to learn the basics of playing an electronic keyboard I recently acquired. I frequently watch Houston's TV show on satellite and subsequently purchased all three of his DVD's, (1) Play Piano in a Flash; (2) Tips and Tricks Volume I; (3) Tips and Trick Volume II. With the exception of his repeated focus on the chords of C, F, and G, there is very little to learn from these DVD's. I wasted $90 to watch something I learned on line for free. Don't waste your time and money buying these videos, they are horrible. Much of the video content is nothing more than video clips from various shows with featured guests. In my opinion, Houston should be ashamed of himself for selling these under the guise of a learning process.",1169510400,60,731,4.545454545454546

1881735,3,B00009A8ZX,Based on the PBS presentation of this program and as a non-classic pianist myself I find the author spends too much time reiterating and interjecting non-essential gab to get to a basic point. You almost get the impression that he likes to hear himself speak(rather than teach). Not to say that you will not get to the purpose of the presentation. I like what the author has to say and agree with most of his concepts as to basic chord piano approach to learning to play. There are better programs available out there and available online which I feel are richer in content and more rewarding.,1156982400,26,593,4.60377358490566
1881736,2,B00009A8ZX,"This DVD would have been a good one if Scott Houston would have played more of the examples. He talks 98% of the time the other 2% he plays. He states on the DVD that He knows that everyone wants to sit down and play the piano, and they don't want to learn all the music theory and do piano excercises. His approach is to sit down at the piano and start playing songs from the very beginning. With him saying all that on the DVD, he never really plays. He spends all the time talking. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone, unless they want to hear a long sermon (lots of talking). If you like hearing someone talk for a couple of hours Why not just go to church and listen to a preacher.  I was thinking about ordering Tips, ""Cheap tricks and professional secrets"" another DVD by Scott houston, but I'm going to passs on that one, Why because I'm not going to spend another $40.00 just watching some one talk for 3hrs.",1143504000,44,921,4.232954545454546

The DVD is great, in my opinion, for beginners. Scott's teaching style is fun and entertaining, and easy to follow. He made the music study and piano playing not at all as daunting as I thought. For me, the DVD is a great start, at least led me through the gate of the musical kingdom that I thought I'd never find time to accomplish.

The author, who plays very well, indeed, simply has not broken down the skills needed. OK, we don't want years of lessons at THIS point! But the shortcut method of ""chording"" didn't get me near where I wanted to be.

Don't despair if this didn't work for you. Just try another adult method, maybe from a publisher like Kjos or Alfred, who have books geared for beginning adults. The chording short-cut is fine if you have a really good ear, can read music well enough, and have a steady sense of rhythm. Otherwise, you'll end up frustrating yourself, wondering why it doesn't sound better, and not knowing what to do to make it sound better",1121472000,28,864,4.532051282051282
