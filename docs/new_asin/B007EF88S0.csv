8515259,5,B007EF88S0,"'Aisi Bhi Kya Jaldi Hai' is an excellent family movie that is really feel-good and heart-warming. The actors are not-so-well-known names, apart from Ashok Saraf, a famous support actor, but the delivery here is just superb!

This is a labour-of-love for Sachin, who produced and directed the movie, as well as being the main character, Mr. Sanjay Malhotra who plays a father who is doting, teetering on the point neurotic, so brilliantly.

Shrishti Behl plays Simran, a very modest girl and portrays her shy, paternally-oppressed character excellently, and Vivek Mushran is her vibrant love-interest.

The movie is moving, with thoroughly convincing acting performances, and watching the movie you'll feel like the you know the characters as if they were part of your own family. The movie is also hilarious at times.

At 2hrs 12 mins seems a bit short for a hindi movie! But really worth watching.",1375660800,,898,5.08843537414966
