8684083,3,B00OL0LU6I,"La Cinaga, or, The Swamp, is a film that simulates real life instead of providing a plot with interconnected sequences. A suspenseful opening (which acts as an attention-hooking device) prepares the viewer for intrigue, but quickly resorts to everyday occurrences. Expect a drama pretty much limited to quibbling, babbling, staring, teasing, and drinking. The cast are able actors, but none of the characters they portray are particulary interesting. The younger characters prove to be more entertaining than the adults who seem to spend most of their time wallowing in self-pity. When the youths behave in a curious manner, it makes the viewer wonder what kind of mischief they're plotting with the anticipation that something tragic or amusing might happen. The viewer waits and waits, but the activity remains pretty much the same throughout the course of the film. La Cinaga never really manages to be anything more than mildly engaging. It might appeal to those who have a similar, narrow perspective on life, but most will find that this drama has little to offer. Others, such as film students, may appreciate the cinematographic style and the director's neo-realist approach to filmmaking.",1474243200,2,1197,5.272251308900524
8684084,3,B00OL0LU6I,"3 1/2 stars for this visually arresting but rather inert movie, though the inertness of the characters and the lives they lead is partly the point.  It's a problem to represent the lives of boring people without making a boring movie or novel, and the director Lucrecia Martel, abetted by the fine cinematography of Hugo Colace, makes a good go of it.  Martel says in one of the special features that come with the Criterion issue that she wants to keep the viewer off balance, and she achieves this by deliberate fragmentation of the narrative, quick cuts between different kinds of action or inaction, odd angles of vision that put the characters sometimes peripherally in the frame and sometimes are so close that we see only parts of people.  The reasons for the ennui that seems to hold the characters -- mainly members of two related families, it seems -- are not explicitly made clear, though there are obviously tensions within (and among) the family members and tensions in the social milieu which make it a matter of concern whether or not it is too dangerous to cross a border to go shopping.  And there is a class issue too, between the bourgeois families and their Indian servants, whom they talk about as if they are subhuman.  And all this despite the fact that the bourgeois adults drink too much -- to the point of falling down -- and the children, the older and younger in different ways, are running wild.

Gradually there dawns on the viewer not just the obvious sense of wasted lives and wasted time, but also a sense of threat, of danger and violence.  It's for this that the eponymous swamp (la cienaga) is the appropriate trope. The wanton shooting of the cow that is stuck in the mud really stands for the overall ambience, but there's also the stagnant and unhealthy-looking swimming pool, and the swamping downpours of rain.  The atmosphere of deliquescence is pervasive (all that ice and wine!),  and it's a surprise that more people don't get physically hurt, although some do, and the damage is largely self-inflicted.  The other iconic scene is one in which a small boy climbs a ladder to look over a wall at dogs he fears and falls off the ladder.  No one seems to notice, and we last see him in a distant shot, still lying there.  The children in the movie are wonderful -- even though their frantic action seems to have no point beyond itself.  There are moody sexual intimations too that come to nothing, and late in the movie one of the adults, Mecha (Graciela Borges), who spends most of the movie refilling her wine glass, bans her husband from the marital bed.  Why? Because he dyes his hair?  There's no future for such people, and if this is the Argentinian middle class, the outlook is bleak.",1470700800,3,2734,4.6314699792960665
8684085,3,B00OL0LU6I,"Lucrecia Martel's ""La Cienega"" is an utterly boring look at a petit-bourgeois family that is so devoid of life, you wonder why they don't all just jump into a pool of quicksand and drown.  There's no life in any of the scenes or characters, nothing but mundanity.  The children have examples of sadism in them, when they shoot a cow stuck in mud; they are found roaming the forest doing nothing in particular.

The beginning of the film finds the matriarch boozing it up at the pool with a bunch of equally lethargic friends.  She slips and cuts her chest, and that is the major plot point, that and sitting in bed, driving in old jalopy cars, or doing nothing at all.  A lot of wine drinking completes the tediously long scenes.

The family lives on some estate somewhere in South America, where Indians are insulted.  The Indians are not much better, going to parties to brawl or drink or play pool or hack up fish in the waters by a dam.  You'll have a hard time getting to the end since it drags along.

The children are selfish, spoiled brats.  There's no ""brilliance"" or luminosity in this film at all.  The extras include a film by the director Lucrecia Martel, where she boasts about her film.  Also some film by the pretentious windbags of the ""New Argentine Cinema"" is found.  A small booklet by another pretentious intellectual, who raves about how great Lucrecia Martel's ""La Cienega"", is also stuck with the DVD.

This is a thoroughly average film despite what the reviews might claim about it.",1449446400,4,1507,4.595505617977528
8684086,3,B00OL0LU6I,"I was intrigued by this film when I learned the Criterion Collection would release it. I had never heard of it and I thought it might be worth watching. I'm glad I watched it. It was worth watching, especially for a person interested in international cinema. The film was well-shot, has a literary approach to storytelling (fans of Faulkner's As I Lay Dying will especially enjoy seeing this), and the performances are subtle yet moving.

My problem with the film is that it simply left me wanting more. I couldn't rally behind what the director was trying to say. I ended up feeling no sympathy for any of these characters except for Isabel, the harried maid in the household.",1429401600,2,677,4.689075630252101
