8449001,5,B004YXDGZ0,"I ordered this movie on iTunes, not knowing what to expect. If you want to gain a better understanding of TM, google it, you'll find plenty of information on the internet. If you're interested in learning about an interesting town in Iowa and seeing the benefits of meditation first hand, I highly recommend this movie. It's a fascinating human interest story that motivated and inspired me to dig deeper into the practice of meditation.",1454198400,,437,4.918918918918919

8449003,1,B004YXDGZ0,"The documentary is more of a infomercial for the school and for the David Lynch Foundation.  It gives no real explanation on what Transcendental Meditation is.  It doesn't really explain how it is making a difference in the students lives other than the children giving interviews and saying they are less mad at their siblings.  This is a ""talking heads"" documentary that doesn't really tell a story.  I would have liked to have seen a couple stories of changes in children...seen the proof.  I am a public school administrator.  I would have like to have seen how the public school systems can incorporate this without breaking the no religion in school policies and laws. It says Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are in it.  Yes, for not even a minute and its not an interview.  It shows them at a publicity engagement promoting the David Lynch Foundation.  I'm sure the foundation is doing fantastic work, but this documentary lacks proof.",1350432000,4,941,4.83125
8449004,4,B004YXDGZ0,"I like documentaries about interesting people and methods of living and learning.  The movie fits that bill.  It is a documentary about a school in Iowa where the students and faculty practice Transcendental Meditation (TM) as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.  Students at different grade levels are interviewed and give their opinions on meditation.

In my opinion, some additions to the movie would have made it more interesting.  I would have liked to have seen more diversity in the student population.  There was one brief interview with a principle from an inner city school that adopted the program.  Also, everyone in the movie was pro-TM.  I would have liked to hear from some con-TM parents, students, or faculty.  Or even from some folks who were con-TM who changed their minds and were pro-TM.  How did TM positively or negatively affect test scores?  Was the curriculum any different than public schools? What about some before and after TM effects on students, parents, faculty?

The concept of including one or two periods of meditation in the school day is fascinating and I think would be very beneficial. I hope there is a School of Thought 2.",1347321600,6,1161,4.927835051546392
