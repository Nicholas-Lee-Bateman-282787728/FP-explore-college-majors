Special Footnote, Charles Starrett was an American actor best known for his starring role in the ""Durango Kid"" Columbia Pictures western series ... In 1933 he was one of the people who helped organize the Screen Actors Guild, and in 1936 signed with Columbia Pictures to become one of the top ten western stars, starring in 115 movies the following 16 years ... in playing assorted sheriff and rangers roles, Starrett gained notoriety for his role as the ""Durango Kid"", the first film in which he played his famous alter-ego character was known as ""The Durango Kid"", which was released in 1940, but for some reason, Columbia did not see fit to continue with the series at that time ... the character was revived in 1944 and lasted through 1952. Dub Taylor, as ""Cannonball"", worked with Starrett until 1946 ... at that time, Smiley Burnette, who had been a very popular sidekick to Gene Autry, was brought in to replace Taylor. Burnette, appropriately enough, played a character called Smiley Burnette ... ""The Durango Kid"" series combined vigorous action sequences - often with speeded up camera work and spectacular stunts performed by Jock Mahoney - and western music ... each film featured a singing group, and many gave free rein to Burnette's singing and playing ... Starrett, who was independently wealthy, ended his acting career at 48 age when the ""Durango Kid"" series ceased production.
