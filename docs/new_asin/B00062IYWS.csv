8037240,1,B00062IYWS,"This disc is so compressed, that the movements look like painted animation! If Platinun Disc would release these as two to a disc, they would look much better. Don't bother with this 8-movie DVD set, you can not watch it!

This is an ""8-Movie"" 2-disc box set of their previous individualy released ""4-Movie"" discs.

Disc 1:
MR WISE GUY - Similar to the Alpha/Gotham edition but with more artifacting from compression. Watchable.

THAT GANG OF MINE - Unwatchable! So Compressed that it is annoying to try to watch.  However, it includes a scene missing from the Alpha/Gotham edition.

GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE - Missing the opening titles! More compressed than other DVD releases of this title.  I strongly suggest the VCI East Side Kids Double Feature version of this title.

BOWERY BLITZKRIEG - Good master, but compression shows. I suggest getting Platinum's individual release of this movie, it looks good.

Disc 2:
'NEATH THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - Similar to the Alpha/Gotham edition but with more artifacting from the compression. Watchable.

PRIDE OF THE BOWERY - Unwatchable! So compressed that it is annoying to try to watch. There is a trade-off, the Alpha/Gotham copy has distorted & noisy audio which you can not understand.

MILLION DOLLAR KID - Similar to the Alpha/Gotham edition but with more artifacting from the compression. Watchable.

BOYS OF THE CITY - Unwatchable! So Compressed that it is annoying to try to watch.

Unless you plan to watch this on a 15"" TV screen you had better look for other copies, even VHS copies!",1109289600,20,1532,4.918287937743191
