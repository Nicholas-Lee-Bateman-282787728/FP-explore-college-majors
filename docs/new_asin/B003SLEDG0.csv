4188399,5,B003SLEDG0,I got the DVD a day early and it was amazingly funny. I love all their comedies and the stand up was amazing. Everything you love about their movies are in their stand-up. Couldn't be happier with it.,1369094400,,200,4.2894736842105265

4188401,4,B003SLEDG0,"i am a big Broken Lizard fan, because they are 5 guys who get to do what they love, and that is work together and make comedy. in everything they do, you can see that they're having so much fun.

chances are that you know their style of humor if you're going to buy this dvd. there are reasons why drinking, smoking, and sex are popular comedy topics. Broken Lizard surely embraces these topics, but there is more to their work than just cheap jokes. it's different to see them do stand up, enjoyable to see them individually. and it's very strong and funny when they share the stage in storytelling or sketches. makes me wish i could have seen a live show.

personally, while i laughed at their stage work, my favorite parts of this dvd are in the special features. seeing the mini-documentary of them on the road and backstage was a real treat. the chemistry and camaraderie is fun to watch. i hope they one day make a full-length documentary like this.",1294099200,2,955,4.451428571428571

4188404,5,B003SLEDG0,I thought it was good.  They did a recreation of super Troopers.  They told one story that had me laughing at the end.,1287100800,,118,4.086956521739131
4188405,3,B003SLEDG0,"The comedy troupe known as Broken Lizard have been entertaining the masses since the five friends formed a comedy group at Colgate University back in 1990.  The group which consists of Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske are known for films such as ""Super Troopers"", ""Beerfest"" and member Jay Chandrasekhar directed the 2005 film ""The Dukes of Hazard"".

Some may feel their humor is frat boy, wasted on alcohol good times style of comedy and that is no surprise considering that Jay Chandrasekhar assembled the troupe from members of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity and in the beginning, the group did quite a bit of live stand up comedy until they began to focus more on films and television starting off with Comedy Central's ""Is this On?"" as the group wrote and were featured on the comedy short ""Dante's Levels of Hell"".

And after a few independent attempts at film, it was not until 2000 when the group worked on their first major film ""Super Troopers"" which was invited to Sundance and received a distribution deal at Fox Searchlight pictures and eventually became a cult-hit and cemented the comedy troupe's success as the group would then work on ""Club Dread"", ""The Dukes of Hazard"" and ""Beerfest"".  The group recently finished their fifth feature ""The Slammin' Salmon"" which was directed by Kevin Hefferman.

The comedy troupe recorded their live comedy special on January 28th at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles and the following segments are included on ""Broken Lizard Stands Up: Live, Extended and Uncensored"".

  * Backstage Pregame - Featuring the comedy group's pre-game ritual before their live comedy performance.
  * Steve Lemme Stand Up - Talks about he and his buddies enjoying their discussion of masturbation, his impression of Kevin Heffernan's teddybear and more.
  * Sue Boyle - Sure, we know of Susan Boyle but not Kevin Heffernan's version of Sue Boyle.
  * Paul Soter Stand Up - Paul talks about he and his friends disgusting habits and being married.
  * Patrick Swayze - Steve Lemme and Kevin Heffernan talk about meeting Patrick Swayze for the first time.
  * Erik Stolhanske Stand Up - Erik talks about he and his wife trying to have a baby and getting a sperm count and more.
  * Jay Chandrasekhar Stand Up - Jay talks about having a threesome, smoking pot and talking to Indian tech support.
  * Kevin Heffernan Stand Up - Kevin talks about doing full frontal nudity in a film and becoming ""Bear of the Day"".
  * How We Met - The guys tell a story of how they met each other at Colgate University.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Broken Lizard Stands Up: Live, Extended and Uncensored"" is presented in Stereo.  Audio is clear and you can hear the comedian clearly and also hear the audience laughing quite well. Personally, I chose to have my receiver set on stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack but overall, audio is good and found no problems at all.

Closed captions are included with this DVD feature.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Rarely do you find comedy troupe DVD's especially from Comedy Central and for many fans of Broken Lizard, this release is a special treat as you literally get to see five comedians doing stand-up comedy their own way, with their own personal style.

If anything, their comedy style can be seen as comedy targeted for inebriated college students or jokes that guys talk about with their friends and just get a kick out of it.  You know...jokes about farts, sex and masturbation.  Topics that are not for everyone but if you can find yourself laughing about a guy having sex with a ball or teddy bear, this DVD is for you.

With that being said, if one was to judge their comedy through films such as ""Super Troopers, ""Club Dread"", ""Beerfest"" or ""The Slammin' Salmon"", although not major theatrical hits, there are those who can't stand their style of comedy and find it juvenile and moronic, while there is a group who digs their comedy and find them quite hilarious.

For me, I found ""Broken Lizard Stands Up: Live, Extended and Uncensored"" to be one of those shows that would be fun to be with your guy friends and not sure if my wife or her friends would dig it.  If anything, the guys of Broken Lizard are guys you picture yourself hanging out with and just joke around and talk about life experiences and joke about it.

Steve Lemme kicks things off with his discussion of masturbation and just exposing his friend's crazy secrets such as Kevin Heffernan's sex with his teddybear and Steve doing an imitation of that teddy bear.  Then you have Heffernan doing his impression of Susan Boyle as she discusses various sexual moves that she has not partaken in but each word that comes out of her mouth is so hilarious that it gets the crowd going.

Paul Soter then gets into discussions of his friends disgusting habits. From when they sleep or walk around naked, I don't know how crazy things got with these guys at Colgate University but it's hilarious when Soter gets into discussions about his comedy partners and the crazy things that they do.  I know some women might find these topic gross but for guys, you can't help but laugh.

Probably one of the coolest stories was Steve Lemme and Kevin Heffernan describing their story of meeting Patrick Swayze, more like Steve Lemme scaring him off and acting a bit stalker-ish and thus receiving the wrath from Matt Dillon.  But it's a hilarious story with a pretty cool ending.

Erik Stolhanske's comedy definitely hits home to the married crowd, especially the guys who have tried to get their wive's pregnant to no avail.  It's a topic that some guys can relate to.  Guys who spend part of their life in trying not to get someone pregnant but in the times you do want it to happen, it just doesn't happen.

Jay Chandrasekhar's comedy was like hearing a hilarious story from a guy who's wasted but nevertheless, funny dialogue especially when talking about Indian call centers and people from India having to pretend they are from the US yet their pronunciation of his last name just perfectly.  Definitely a funny bit.  And the night ends with Kevin Heffernan's discussion of his full frontal nudity scene  and  all comedians getting together to discuss how they all met to end the performance.

When it's all done, you wish there is more and fortunately there is about 40-minutes more of special features for people to watch including the group's nationwide comedy tour and what goes on behind-the-scenes.

Overall, ""Broken Lizard Stands Up: Live, Extended and Uncensored"" is a hilarious DVD but it's different compared to other Comedy Central DVD's and the fact that you do get stand-up comedy routines from five individuals who have their own style of comedy, it definitely makes a more accessible comedy DVD.  And the fact that there are over 30 minutes of uncensored material not shown on Comedy Central included on this DVD, should make fans of Broken Lizard quite happy.

In the end, this DVD is definitely for their fans.  If you are familiar with their films such as ""Super Troopers, ""Club Dread"", ""Beerfest"", ""The Slammin' Salmon"" or even the ""Dukes of Hazard"" film, and you enjoyed the comedy in those films, more than likely you're going to enjoy the comedy on ""Broken Lizard Stands Up: Live, Extended and Uncensored"".
