8263560,3,B000XF9I5K,"This guy makes so many mistakes that is almost hard to believe he has been doing this for as long as he says he has (sometimes he does catch them though). Also, his voice and speech is so annoying. He adds an ""er""sound to every other word, i.e. Instead of saying ""theta"" he says ""thether."" It gets really really annoying after awhile. The price listed on his website for these DVDs are 50+ dollars which is totally outrageous. For a cheaper price, it may be an ok buy.",1268265600,,468,4.329545454545454
