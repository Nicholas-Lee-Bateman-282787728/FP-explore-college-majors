8587899,5,B00CZDP686,i really loved this dvd. juan manuel marquez is my favourite boxer and this was very informative about how hard he trains and what it's like going on a press conference tour to promote a fight. it's very interesting. and it was good that it also came with english subtitles,1392249600,,273,4.48
8587900,3,B00CZDP686,"the dvd quality is great.
i wasn't to happy with the content. I already knew most
of the material thru online videos and HBO 24/7.
the Dvd focuses more on the Pacquiao fights.
I was expecting more history and material never before seen. More details about his
beginnings, his fights, his opponents, etc.. would of made it excellent.",1381190400,,332,4.741379310344827
