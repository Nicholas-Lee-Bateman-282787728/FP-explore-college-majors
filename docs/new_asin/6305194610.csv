990138,5,6305194610,"If you want to take advantage of yoga to tone your body, this is the DVD. Excellent way to improve your health and appearance.",1367798400,2,126,4.291666666666667
990139,5,6305194610,"I think viewers either love or hate Wai Lana workouts; there is very little room for in between since her workouts are so different from other yoga offerings. Aesthetically, this is a very beautiful workouts, with the outdoor setting in Hawaii and the instructor's colorful outfits. It's so refreshing to do a yoga workout that isn't half sun salutations which is one of the reasons I am such a Wai Lana fan.  She is not chatty, which is also a plus. And the music is beautiful.",1275091200,6,478,4.558139534883721
990140,4,6305194610,"In this video, Wai Lana offers a series of dynamic poses focused on stretching and toning various areas of the body.  She begins with a basic breathing exercise plus some simple stretches for the neck.  Next, you'll wake up the legs by alternating between a squat and a toe raise, then move on a standing knee to chest stretch.  Still in a standing position, Wai Lana performs what she calls a ""Dancing Forward Bend"" (the names for all of her poses appear briefly on screen, which is helpful because she frequently uses names I've never seen before), which is basically a continuous flow between a standing forward bend and a standing backbend.  The final standing posture is a variation on triangle pose in which your legs are only shoulder-width apart.

Wai Lana then moves to the floor for some back stretches, including a locust variation, a rear leg lift on hands and knees, and a cat/cow series.  From a seated position, she performs a forward bend and a simple twist.  Moving to lying on your back, you'll finish with a single leg lift, bridge pose, single leg cirlces, and then double leg circles.  After setting you up for savasana, Wai Lana invites you to join her in seated chanting, but I just stayed in savasana the entire time (about 5 minutes); the entire practice comes in at just under 38 minutes.  Overall, I found this practice to be enjoyable and relaxing, and I felt nicely stretched out afterwards.  Because there are brief pauses between every pose segment, you can perform as many or as few postures as you choose, simply picking up where you left off the next time, so this practice is easily customizable to your needs.

If you've never tried Wai Lana before, you should be aware that she wears an elaborate new outfit for each asana, uses bright makeup, and has a heavy accent; all of this takes a bit of getting used to.  However, she provides very good instruction with frequent form reminders (although her cueing is non-mirrored), is quite encouraging, and practices against an absolutely gorgeous setting in Hawaii with a Pacific Ocean backdrop. The Wai Lana series is definitely worth checking out if you have been practicing yoga for awhile and are looking for a departure from mainstream yoga videos.",1116460800,3,2235,4.761658031088083
990141,5,6305194610,"I found this easy series just right for me as a beginner. This Toning Workout is a little harder than the others that are in the series (Beginners Workout and Relaxation Workout). I have had to do some for less time than shown and have over the last couple months strengthened incredibly. This is really the only exercise I do and my muscles are firm and movement is coming much easier for me. When finished I feel like I've had a full body workout. It is refreshing and energizing.
Wai Lana has a soothing voice that my husband calls monotone, but I find it slightly melodious and very easy to ignore when I'm doing something else, but easy to hear and calming to listen to when I do. She moves between poses rather quickly, but after a while I got used to this. If this is bothersome to you at first you can do the ""One Asana at a time"" or just do the poses in less time to give you time to rest more between poses. Wai Lana has beautiful outfits that change throughout each session and a variety of beautiful backgrounds. Her outfits are very modest and not form fitting (a plus for men who don't want distraction). She wears an elastic belt around her waist, which helps you see what she is doing with her waist. She is very descriptive of how to do the poses and what benefits you are getting. Because her voice is non-intrusive it isn't irritating that she talks most of the time. She says nothing extraneous that would distract you from the pose and over a long period of time of using the DVD hearing her say the same things each time doesn't get irritating.
On the main menu you have ""Start Workout"", ""Extras"", and Introduction (which is the same on each DVD in the easy series). The ""Start Workout"" is the entire work out for that DVD. The workout itself consists of about 35 minutes of postures. After that is a time of music and meditation. Under ""Extras"" it lists ""One Asana at a time"", which does as it says; ""Customize your workout"", this lets you do the asanas (poses) in any order you wish with 17 asanas (on the beginner's I didn't count there others) and 20 slots for your choices, so you can do one more than once or some not at all as you don't have to fill all the slots; ""Guidelines"" this is a basic rundown of things to do and not to do to get the most out of it and prevent injury; ""Using Yoga Props"", which is a 12 minute segment with a model (not Wai Lana) with a man's voice explaining how to use the mat, block, and strap and also shows the Hero and the Shoulder Loosening poses modified; and ""More from Wai Lana"", which covers all the things she has to sell - her other DVDs and tapes, her music CDs, mats, etc. You can also see those things on her website: [...]
Each DVD comes with an illustrated book showing a picture of each asana, its English name, and what it physically benefits most. This is useful if you are going traveling and don't have a DVD player, doing the set outside, or if you want to do the set at your own pace.
There is also an option on the main screen of each that allows you to change from English to Spanish.
The Toning Workout includes: Energizing Breath, Neck Exercises, Tiptoe Squats, Flamingo, Dynamic Forward Bend, Triangle Stretch, Cobra Stretch, Grasshopper, Cat Stretch, Sunset Stretch, Leg Lifts, Lower Body Rock, Inclined Bridge, Leg Gyration, Samadhai Pose, and Meditation.
Side note: the asana Wai Lana is doing on the front of each DVD cover is not included on that DVD, so don't pick the DVD(s) you buy by the asana pictured on the front.",1085097600,14,3509,4.36697247706422
990142,5,6305194610,"Wai Lana's Toning Workout has been a huge relief for me.  Four months after moving from the countryside to the big city I had begun to experience fatigue due to smog and environmental changes.  My body wasn't able to deal with it making me barely able to fully complete my work, which previously had been so easy.  Taking supplements helped a little.  After seeing the beauty of Wai Lana's Yoga program on Television one day, I decided that doing regular Yoga might help my situation.  I ordered toning workout online and have been diligently practicing it every morning.  My fatigue has gradually subsided and I feel better than I did before I moved to the city!  My morning Yoga practice has become a very pleasant part of my day with Wai Lana's soft calming voice and the beautiful scenery in the background.  I've ordered 5 other videos and can't wait until they arrive!",1073260800,2,874,4.666666666666667
990143,2,6305194610,"Disappointing. Do understand though that what I am looking for is an instructional forum which devotes at least 50-60 solid minutes of actual stretching and asana work. Verbal instruction should occur simultaneously with the movements, poses and stretches. This tape spends about 25 minutes on very few and simple asanas and the remaining 40-45 minutes of the tape is all talk about why yoga is so wonderful and why everyone should be doing it, or, just advertisements of Wai Lana's other products.",1055980800,2,498,5.085365853658536
990144,5,6305194610,"I have been using this and the beginner's workout, and I feel great - in fact, I've always hated to exercise and now I'm getting up before the kids so I can get in my yoga. I had a new baby several months ago, and completely lost my balance, flexibility, mind, etc. This workout for me was actually a little better than the beginner workout for starting out because my abs needed serious work, but the asanas didn't require me to be extremely flexible to start - Wai Lana encourages the viewer to work up to the heavier stretches, but be patient and don't strain. You still get quite a muscle burn, though! The filming is beautiful, her voice is kind and not judgemental or too peppy.  After a session, I feel calm, centered, and ready for the day.  My three year old loves it too - she usually wanders in sleepily and watches the end of it, saying ""I wanna go that place.""  Only thing it's missing is a plane ticket to her practice spots.",974419200,,939,4.323863636363637

7885325,5,6305194610,This video was a little more challenging than beginner.  I like that she talks you though proper positioning.
