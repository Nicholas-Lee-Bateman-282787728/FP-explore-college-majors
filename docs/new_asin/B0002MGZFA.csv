8029302,1,B0002MGZFA,All I got was an empty case no DVD inside it was very disappointing,1502064000,,67,3.857142857142857
8029303,5,B0002MGZFA,"This DVD is extremely low budget but shouldn't be understated because of it's true character representation of Tupac Shakur. He wasn't only a hip hop artist, he was also a man of the people. With interviews with Michael Eric Dyson and many more who believed in what Tupac represented. Not the best in a of collection of DVDs about Tupac, but it's worth a look.",1196467200,,360,4.553846153846154
8029304,5,B0002MGZFA,I enjoyed this film about 2Pac. He was the greatest Rapper and poet!! This tells the story of his life and how it was cut short when he was only 25. He will be sadly missed. 2Pac R.I.P.,1132790400,5,185,3.8947368421052633
