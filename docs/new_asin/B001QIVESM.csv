8335818,4,B001QIVESM,"Another excellent Andy Aledort instructional DVD.  Great stuff on a little covered guitar topic.  It is thick with info, so I am working my way slowly thru it.",1493856000,,159,4.642857142857143
8335819,5,B001QIVESM,"This video is not for beginners, but there is a lot here for people who are comfortable with three chords and want to expand. It is not exactly ""rock"", though everything covered can be used in rock, but it works just as well for people who play solo acoustic. The video touches on a lot of different areas. I really like the section on alternate tunings. It has encouraged to try more than just the basic open slide stuff. The instruction is good and clear. I give it five despite it being such a mix of stuff that it doesn't quite work as a style lesson like an all slide or all rock video. However, it is a video that I can pick up on  at any point and learn something. I rented it and a bunch of other stuff from Netflix. This is the one I bought.",1431648000,,750,4.0675675675675675
8335820,3,B001QIVESM,"good quality, but a little difficult for a rookie with the guitar",1423008000,,65,4.5
8335821,5,B001QIVESM,"One of the best acoustic rock DVDs around.  There is plenty here for beginner to somewhat experienced players.  Everything is explained and demonstrated so that you can clearly understand how it is supposed to sound and how you are supposed to practice the technique.  Even better, the ideas are actually very useful.  Spend a few minutes watching and practicing and you will be rewarded with techniques that make your playing better (for both you, the listeners, and your bandmates).
One of the best features that sets this DVD apart is the instructor.  He is there to explain and show you how to do something, he understands he isn't there to be ""cool"" and toss his hair around like a prancing pony.  What a breath of fresh air!
Bottom line, the ideas are useful, clearly presented, and fun to do.  Get this, practice the ideas, and just ask your band mates if they can't hear a positive difference.  Well worth the money.",1411776000,2,924,4.695652173913044
8335822,4,B001QIVESM,"Good company to deal with, they go out of their way to do the customer right.
The DVD is a tough one to follow for the beginner, you really need to be in the intermediate level (familiar with bar chords and with major, minor and blues scales under your belt).
If you have all that then you will definitely get alot of knowledge from this guy, he's fantastic on the acoustic. A brilliant rock musician.",1367107200,,401,4.36
8335823,2,B001QIVESM,I expected the CD case with picture and info of the CD. Just got a CD copy in a CD envelope. I believe copywright laws are being broken. Too much money for a 5 cent copy.,1308355200,,170,3.75
8335824,2,B001QIVESM,The author showed impressive guitar licks that he plays so fast that I can't see where his fingers are positionioned.,1301356800,2,117,4.9
8335825,3,B001QIVESM,The product is ok but its just a little too advanced. At least for me it was. Keep it for later on when I hopefully will get better.,1254182400,2,132,3.75
8335826,5,B001QIVESM,"I too strongly disagree with the negative review! Mine came with an awesome PDF download that has every tab and scale on the DVD; very easy to follow. Great strumming techniques, great finger picking, great Blues instruction, great basic Folk progressions, great basic soloing.

In one day I was doing cool solo's to a basic G C G D Folk progression! Also playing basic Blues in one day! I'd never played that stuff before!

At last everything I need to learn!!! I highly recommend this DVD to anybody wanting to learn the essential basics of Acoustic Guitar.

The lessons go by too fast??? It's a DVD!! You can rewind!!!",1251936000,3,621,4.678899082568807
8335827,5,B001QIVESM,"David Bruce is completely wrong in his review of this DVD.  There is a booklet that comes with the DVD. It's on the DVD in PDF format so you can print it out.  There are even notations on the video that tell you what page of that video to refer to for each lesson. On top of that, this is the finest video of its type ever made, in my opinion, and I have a couple dozen of them.  I think David might have got his DVDs mixed up because he's not describing this one.",1251936000,8,464,3.863157894736842
