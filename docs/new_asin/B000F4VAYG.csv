8465788,5,B000F4VAYG,"Based off of Elena Fortn's timeless Spanish children's classics, Celia is a delightful six-part series that will surely amuse the entire family.  Celia is a seven-year old girl belonging to a high class Spanish family living in Madrid, Spain. Like any other little girl her age, Celia wonders and questions the world surrounding her, does not understand adults and constantly wishes to live in a world of fantasy and imagination.

In the first episode, ""Soy Celia"" (""I am Celia"") we are introduced to our little heroine as deals with Miss Nelly, the English woman who's come to Madrid in request of Celia's mother to teach the girl the English language.  Unfortunately Celia shows no interest in the subject and Miss Nelly's task becomes an exhausting one indeed.  Celia will rather run through the streets of Madrid in the company of her friend Soledad, or Solita, the porter's daughter.  When Miss Nelly's patience ends and leaves for England, Celia's mother will have to find someone else to take the almost dangerous position.

Doa Benita arrives in the second episode ""Doa Benita"" taking in the place of Miss Nelly, a change that is welcomed soon by Celia for she quickly finds out that Doa Benita is as imaginative as she is.  Celia tells, as she and her friend Mara Teresa walk through the park, stories about Doa Benita's stay at their Madrid home.  The elderly woman has made an enemy, the young moor Maimn who is here in service of Celia's uncle Rodrigo, but Maimn has found a friend in Celia.  The episode concludes with Celia's attendance at a lackluster birthday party for To Rodrigo, for the other two young guests are as sour as two little girls can be.

""El Verano"" (""The Summer"") arrives and Celia is off to the beach with her mother, father, Doa Benita and the rest of the family, as well as Celia's little baby brother, who she's named Cuchifritn.  Celia spends most of the summer with her new friend Carlotica, remaining indoors to escape the ongoing rain.  While Carlotica's grandfather sleeps, she and Celia start entertaining themselves searching through the contents of an old trunk in which the old man keeps all of his robes and garments from his days of theatrical performance.  When the old man wakes up to find his treasures scattered all over the floor, he becomes quite angry indeed.  Later on, when Celia overhears her parents talk about financial problems, Celia does not hesitate to do whatever she can to help, even if it means disguising herself as a gypsy worker and perform all kinds of hard tasks.  Celia's careless behavior endanger the health of her little brother and her father sees no other solution than to send the girl to a convent for young girls.

""En el Colegio"" (At the school) run by strict, yet kind nuns Celia manages to make both friends and enemies.  She doesn't particularly like the other girls and the endless rules of the school are an annoyance for her.  She befriends the Madre Isolina, a kind nun with a french accent and a few of the other nuns.  Celia's innocence once again strikes when she overhears that ""the world is coming to an end"", Celia takes these words literally and quickly informs the other girls, causing a great riot that results in severe punishment.  Celia discovers that the way to make friends is to accuse herself of the wrong-doings of others, but when she takes responsability for fire-starting and even murder, things go too far.  Celia then promises to be truthful and makes the decision to become a Saint.

In the fifth episode, ""Ni Santa, ni Mrtir"" (Not Saint, not Martyr), Celia once again takes things too far in her quest to become a Saint, now imitating other girls with the same goals, Celia steals to give to the homeless boys and girls and even lets herself be mistreated by Elguibia, a schoolmate whom Celia takes the fancy that she is a Saint herself.  Don Restituto, tired of taking the gilt for Celia's ""innocence"", forbid's Celia from becoming a Saint, something Celia once again takes literary.  Celia then befriends another girl who hopes to be a Martyr and helps Celia be one, too, but the way to Africa is a long one and both girls find themselves ""content"" at the school far before the end of their journey.  The end of the year is approaching and the girls are not doing brightly in the preparation for the end-of-the-year exams, it is then that Madre Loreto cooks up a plan to have each girl answer only what is needed in the test, but when Madre Superiora changes the order of things in the very exam, things get complicated.  The episode ends with Celia discovering that her hopes for a vacation with her parents by the beach will be crushed by her parents leaving to, as she believes, China.  Celia runs away in tears which concerns her father, but his plan to leave does not change.

""Hasta la Vista!"" (""Until we meet again!"") is the final episode of this incomplete series.  In it, Celia spends her summer at the convent, finishing tasks she hadn't managed to finish for school before the end of the year.  An elderly woman arrives at the convent, Doa Remedios and she and Celia, after a pleasant introduction to each other, become sour enemies.  Celia's dislike for the woman comes when she constantly sees her attacking all of her beloved animal friends, Culicul the stork, Rabona the cat and even a bunch of invading cockroaches, who become the key element for Celia's successful revenge.  After an unpleasant encounter with the cockroaches, Doa Remedios (Now widely nicknamed as Doa Merlucines) is sent away, leaving everyone believing she has contracted rabies.  Celia receives her last visit from her father before he meets with the others in Barcelona and takes Celia to a small circus show in the village, in their return, Celia is left once again alone at the now empty convent with Madre Loreto and receiving as a present from her father, a book in which to write stories.  Her first story is that of how she will leave the school with the gypsies in a journey to China to find her parents, where her story ends.

Yes, the very last episode ends abruptly with ""Continuar..."" on the screen which means ""To be continued"", but that's where the end came for production never resumed and sadly we never get to find out what happens to Celia or why the series ended like that, not even in the DVD bonus features which is a real shame.  Still, even with this, Celia is delightful Spanish television series that anyone (Who speaks Spanish or will not mind subtitles) will enjoy.  In order to continue the adventures of Celia, I recommend reading the original ""Celia"" tales by Elena Fortn.",1151884800,2,6605,4.712173913043478
