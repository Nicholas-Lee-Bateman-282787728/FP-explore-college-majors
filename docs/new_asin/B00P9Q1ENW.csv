8687078,3,B00P9Q1ENW,"The film was sometimes informative, sometimes humorous, but almost always heavily biased.  It presented only the two extremes of sex ed.  The spartan abstinence-only approach, which it virtually dismissed.  And, we're going to teach how to do anything you want while minimizing risk of pregnancy or disease, the course the film most often favored.  There was no common-sense middle ground, as in: The only completely safe course is either abstinence or single-partner sex within a lifetime relationship -- but if you chose ruin the risk, here's how to minimize it.  In this sense, while giving lip-service to the complexity of human sexuality, the film was actually simplistically reductionist.  It assumed all teens will have sex anyway, so the ""minimal risk"" approach best.  Yet according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of Planned Parenthood, only 16% of teens have had sex by age 15, 35% by age 16, and 48% by age 17.  In other words, slightly more than half of high school students are abstaining from sex.  The film simply dismissed this, along with the ""Russian roulette"" analogy on the limited protection afforded by condoms. Yet the statistics don't lie.  Even when using a condom, both male and female run about a 16% chance of contracting an STD from an infected partner.  That's 1 in 6 -- exactly the same odds as Russian roulette.  As the late Dr. Robert Noble, infectious diseases expert specializing in AIDS treatment at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, warned us back in 1992: ""Passing out condoms to teenagers is like issuing squirt guns for a four-alarm fire. Condoms just don't hack it.  We should stop kidding ourselves.""  This film does its fair share of myth-busting, but at the same time promotes more modern myths.  In that sense, it is as dangerous as the misguided sex ed films of the 50's and 60's.",1424217600,2,1859,4.932475884244373
8687079,5,B00P9Q1ENW,"Over the years there have been many compilations of ""educational films"" for sex education in schools (many from McGraw-Hill) or for servicemen (and servicewomen) about sexually transmitted diseases. I thought that was what this DVD contained. Instead I was pleased to see that it is a new (2014) 76-minute documentary about these films and any impact they might have made on those they were created for. It is a serious film but with lots of clever humor and great graphics. There are comments by educators as well as many former teens or service personnel who tell about their first experiences. It really is highly entertaining but still raises the question of how much money the US government spent last year alone on ""abstinence"" education programs.

One of the major interviewees is Rick Prelinger, a UC-Santa Cruz professor whose ""Prelinger Archive"" preserves ""ephemeral films like these"". There are now over 60,000 films in his collection.  I've known of his archive for years but this is first time I've seen him talk.

The DVD adds two complete films from 1971 and 1976 (about 28 minutes total) as well as four ""deleted"" scenes (most barely 30 seconds).

Be aware that there are some brief scenes of full-frontal nudity.

This film has been playing film festivals and is now on DVD from First Run Features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8687080,4,B00P9Q1ENW,"Completely filled with dozens of original and never before seen footage of 'sex education films' since World War II, this film can bring embarrassment and laughter.  The post war generations seemed clueless about what to teach or learn.  Film segments bring forth such ridiculously bizarre and nave scenarios that make one wonder how a generation ever made it through that phase.  The liberal sixties and seventies are also filled with films that attempt to be current, but are surprisingly timid.  The later years are also limited in real honest information even during the AIDS crisis.

In the 90's, frank talk about 'masturbation' got one woman fired from the Clinton administration and 'homosexuality' was shown as evil, full of predators searching for victims.  It wasn't until 1973 that it was declassified as a mental disorder.  Politics and religion played a major force in much film information.  Some of it will surprise you and some will infuriate you.

The film manages to balance the awkwardness of sex education and the unintentional humor anyone can relate to.  There are five short extras as well, making for a bit of a giggle now and them.  Film provided for review purposes.",1420416000,2,1192,5.030612244897959
