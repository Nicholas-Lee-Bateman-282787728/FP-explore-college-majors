I just watched the trailer...so powerful and touching. I have not been this excited about a movie in a long time. Sometimes when I read the Bible I lose track of the awareness that Jesus Christ was not only our savior, but a man. To see him smile, to see him touch those who were ill and heal them...the love emanates from Him. It will help me to remember that Jesus does understand me...us...this place. And remembering that He died for me...for you...and faced this death with the same humanity. But He did it just the same. Thank YOU JESUS!!!

5452127,1,B00AMR5FGA,"If Hollywood is not going to make Bible movies or shows that are 100% true to the wording of the Bible; what was said and how events actually played out, don't bother to make a film or series at all.  The Bible is perfect and inerrant as is without any Hollywood additions or deletions.

The Ark was never referred to as a boat. The Bible makes no mention of Isaac getting scared or crying or begging his dad not to kill him. Moses never said, ""Haven't I shown you enough faith?!?!"" to God. He obeyed without question.

I don't understand why any artistic license should be taken with the Bible. Either tell it like the Bible tells it to the detail or don't make a movie or series.",1521417600,,681,4.3046875

5452131,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The good parts of this series far out number the bad. I am a big fan of the Italian Lux Vide series of bible stories from the 80's, sold here on Amazon under the title ""The Bible Collection"". I have almost every Lux Vide story and highly recommend Abraham (my all time favourite), Jacob etc... through to Solomon, Jeremiah and Esther. I was looking for more DVDs to complete my collection, and now I have found it. This Series (The Bible) with mostly British actors is first class. I was a bit dissapointed with some earlier stories like Samson, but from Saul through to Jesus it is excellent. It is great to see Bible Stories. I don't expect them to be 100% on track. That might be boring. I am glad that producers give a version that suits them, though I must say that this series is inspiring and is pretty authentic to the Bible. There are some Politically-Correct annoyances (like Samson), but on the whole I like most of it very much and it is well scripted and acted. Some of the one-liners are really good and add to the drama. Will have to get the AD follow up. The historical re-enactments are very good and on-par with the Lux Vide series.

Just as there are four Gospels, four versions of the same story in the Bible, every individual will see diferent things in the Bible, so it is only natural that a televised Bible story will not be 100% the way you see it. I like that - it makes it interesting. This series is very faithful to the theme of the stories and has some powerful speeches in it.

I was surprised to learn that the producer, Mark Burnett, was an ex-British paratrooper and was with 3 Para on Mt Longdon (The Falklands 1982), as that was a battle that I read about in the book titled ""Three Days in June"", an excellent but harrowing account of that war. If he was on Mt Longdon then he has already seen hell. I cried reading this book. It effected me as much as ""The Forgotten Soldier"" which is about the Eastern Front in WW2.",1520035200,,1953,4.333333333333333

5452136,5,B00AMR5FGA,Great series!! Even my 6 yr old was entertained by it.,1518739200,,54,4.0
5452137,1,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible is far deeper than anyone in this generation could have realized! So much deep philosophy and human drama, emotional depth and mind-blowing stories! Oh, wait. That was from when I read the Bible on my own as a sixteen year old.
This show, like any given Hollywood flick based on a book, is terribly shallow, missing out on the best parts, missing the mark on all emotional payoffs, changing important details for the sake of TV audience and time, etc. If you have time, here are my thoughts.
Every story has a beginning. Sadly, this story's genesis gets condensed from chapter 1 to about halfway through chapter 6. Adam and Eve get maybe a second of screen time each. That insults the start of creation and the beauty of God's peace!
From there, for every major story shown (with their major liberties taken), there are at least 50 sub stories ignored. A lot of those stories would've gotten this Michael Bay-obsessed generation of teen boys interested in the Bible. Instead, they're shown something vaguely similar to a dramatic skit in church with blood.
Oh, speaking of... Every episode claims to keep to ""the spirit of the book"" and cautions that there will be scenes of violence. Really? Just violence? I've read the book as a teen and was shocked that it contained sex scenes. Genesis 38 is a great example, which gets no reference. Nor Ezekiel 23. Essentially, I feel like the disclaimer is insulting an American audience that demands to be treated as adults. Then again, I read a review elsewhere that the reviewer shielded his *teen* grandkids's eyes during the violence. *Groans*
Yeah, never mind about us being mature.
Structurally, this show is very much average, barely takes risks for a book that shows no care for expectations of its audience. The Bible contains shifting writing styles and different points of view (first and third, limited and omniscient), yet this gives you narration like it's a Sunday School Bible lesson for adults. I hardly get a sense of organic storytelling.
In episode 3, you get 2 major stories with 100 years in between scenes, yet there's room for Judges Ehud and Jael, neither of which get mention. What a disappointment for left handers and girls who want a biblical hero! Probably too R-rated for History Channel.
Another problem I have is that, there's basically a ""quadrilogy"" of episodes centered around Jesus, compared to the Harmonized Gospel, it all feels shallow. Plus, we have the Devil, literally looking like Barack Obama. Why? Because the Christian populace (except liberal churches) believed him to be the actual Antichrist, so why not make the Devil look like him? Except that also goes against the Bible. No indication in the Bible that his looks have changed since being exiled from Heaven. Much as I didn't like Obama, I groaned at this tactless stunt. A few stories they get right, and that's keeping in mind they have very few stories about Jesus. For those first two episodes, there seems to be more focus on the Pharisees, to make the audience hate them rather than to love Jesus. That, in itself, was a headache. After that, the looseness of accuracy goes from bad to worse.
With the exception of a minor story set immediately before the crucifixion dealing Pilate's wife. Also, it's apparent that the producers have no real concept of why ancient cultures did things the way they did. For example; the order for 40 lashes? By Roman Law, it was illegal to go above 39 as it was known, then, that any more than that would cause death by blood loss.
For a more accurate movie on the crucifixion that can give you feels, go with Passion of the Christ. For a much more culturally accurate post-crucifixion film, go watch Risen.
All-in-all, the whole show was a shallow, dumbed down mockery of the Bible. Full of American heresies by ancient culture filters, half-done stories, no real depth to the Old Testament stories, and a tragically awful style of the New Testament.
Keep in mind, these are some of the things I couldn't deal with, yet there's quite a bit more I could nitpick about. After all, I was raised on the Bible and took up studying apologetics since college, particularly studying cultures and slang. This show had next to nil of one and none of the other.
I will not recommend this for anyone and will not watch the sequel series.

5452139,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I always consider a mini-series to be a big movie rather than a TV show. Given the subject matter its not just a movie, its an epic.

History Channel has always been a place for me because of its wonderful educational programs. In this, a miniseries based on the Bible's New and Old Testament is something worth looking at. I own a Bible, and to successfully adapt thousand pages of scripture into an epic miniseries would of course take hours. Thankfully this is a nice, fun thrill ride that doesn't get boring and at the same time respectful of the written word.

The series is split down the middle with the first five parts being dedicated to the Old Testament with the books of Genesis, Exodus, Judges, Samuel, Kings and Daniel.  With the last five dedicated to the New Testament Books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts and Revelation.

Each of the episodes being one hour dedicated to a major premise. The first hour pretty much zips the creation of man, the rejection of God, the Great Flood, Abraham, etc. The key moment of the episode of course is the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah, best scene of course being the Angels.

The second hour which adapts the story of Moses. Basically its the Ten Commandments in one hour, but its pretty cool. The third hour the attack on Jericho and the story of Samson and Delilah. The fourth dedicated to the stories of Kings Saul and David. Great seeing David depicted as a child on toward his adulthood. Sad seeing his good and bad moments. The fifth episode dedicated to the final stories of the Old Testament seguing on to the Old Testament with the Daniel and the prophesied Messiah that segues into the New Testament.

The final half of this series is... well call it what you like, Greatest Story Ever Told, King of Kings, Passion of the Christ and all the other great stories of the Life of Christ adapted into a five part miniseries. Diogo Morgado plays a wonderful rendition of Jesus of Nazareth. Not as grand as actors like Max Von Sydow or Jim Caviezel, but decent for television. I especially love how the show deal with Jesus' disciples after his resurrection. Stephen's martyrdom, Paul's Conversion, to John's exile on the isle of Patmos. The churches of Christendom spreading from the Middle-East to the Mediterranean to the whole civilized world.

Truly a great series.",1518220800,5,2327,4.67481662591687

To be honest, I have older Bible and Jesus movies I love so much, so I wasn't wanting anything new.  -I wrongly assumedthat this ""new"" Bible mini-series they showed on Tv.would be somehow ""less"" then what has been done in the past, or I wrongly assumed it would be watered-down.  So, I confess, I wasn't interested in watching it at first, because I had a bad opinion about it, for some reason, I don't fully know why.  --This shows how WRONG I was, and how easily people can be Very WRONG about something (or someone).before they take the time to view something or get to know someone.-in order to learn what it is really about.  I learned this lesson from this, because, when I finally decided to order and Watch the whole Bibles series, everything that Roma and her husband made, --I was incredibly Impressed, and totally fell in lovewith all of it!!!!  I love the person they chose to play Jesus, and also every person they chose to play each part, each was perfect.  It has now become one of my few favorite movies to watch over and over.  The visual beauty of each scene is stunning too, everything, they really did an outstanding job!  I'm so happy to say this and find something like this!  We need More movies that tell the stories of the Bible, to bring them to life so it can teach people what the Bible says.  Too many people are unaware of what the Bible says, they are missing out big time on everything God wants to tell them.  The makers of this DVD have accomplished this task like no one has ever done before, with the best technology has to offer, I feel so happy they have given us these DVDs!.

One of the most powerful moments came 2 nights ago when I was watching an online sermon from one of my favorite preachers. At the end he spoke of how the Apostle Paul began as a tormenter of Christian Jews and was so hateful toward Jesus. Then Jesus put him down and took his sight as well as what transpired directly after. When I went back to where I had stopped on the mini series, it was at that exact spot.

Other commenters have already mentioned that the violence is omnipresent and unecessary; well, it is the only real star here!  In place of depth and insight, we have abundant, detailed violence and special effects. I have to admit that I couldn't even get past the first DVD; when I saw (after 3 episodes) that this was the dominant leit-motiv, I just gave up.  The real messages of the Bible are lost in the blood and the dust of this series.

5452200,2,B00AMR5FGA,Disappointing.  With each episode the narrator repeats what has already been viewed as if you are watching the televised series week by week.  The manufacturer did not edit these repetitious narratives.  The actor playing the role of Jesus rushes through the Lords Prayer and the beatitudes.  Disappointing!  Roma Downey gratuitously shows up again and again.  Most annoying is the mournful music that drones on and on throughout the film.  Very disappointing.,1493337600,,460,5.394366197183099

This film, the whole way through is filled with heresy.  Personally I feel outrage as how the purity and holiness of Our Lady is trashed. For the unaware they make it look like the drama is all according to a good end. These people are destroyers of the True Faith in masse. They are part of the secular media circus. This film is anything but Catholic. I would not even give them a star of approval but I would not be able to make this comment unless I press on one star.

5452220,1,B00AMR5FGA,"First, I would like to say that my husband and I only watched half of this series before we threw it in the garbage can.  I considered hauling it off to a thrift store, but decided it would do more harm than good for whoever might land up with it.  We had purchased it because of a good recommendation from our pastor.  We have been burned before by movie recommendations from friends, but we thought a recommendation from our pastor should be reliable. That didn't turn out to be the case with this one.

The scenery and costuming were very well done, and occasionally there was a scene that was moving and somewhat accurate. However, there was a large amount of violence and many gory, bloody scenes -- far too violent for me.  I certainly would never put a child in front of this series, ever!

One reviewer also mentioned the dirty faces of the actors. This peculiarity is not a big point, but I also noticed it.  It didn't appeal to me, either (nor were dirty faces mentioned anywhere in Scripture).

The other more troubling aspect of this series, besides the liberal use of violence, is that the episode plots vary substantially from the Biblical account most of the time. The series contains far too much ""poetic license"" for us to be comfortable with it.

If the intent of this of the series was to make money or to entertain, it probably succeeded.  If its intent was to accurately portray the Bible, it failed.  Viewers, be forewarned.",1487980800,2,1446,4.565891472868217

This series and the corresponding AD series has been fantastic in renewing our hunger to understand the bible better.  No, not every story portrayed is 100% biblically accurate.  I do not feel like the inaccuracies are attempts to force a certain theology.  Rather, they are more for cinematic reasons.

For example (spoiler alert for the non-bible readers), Jesus goes into the tomb to lift lazarus up and raise him from the dead.  In the bible he calls lazarus out of the tomb.  Small detail but I don't see it having huge theological implications.  If you are a huge stickler for scriptural accuracy, bear in mind that the purpose of this series was not 100% scriptural accuracy but rather to give a fresh and faithful cinematic display of the bible stories.  We like to take the individual stories and then look them up to find the differences.",1483488000,43,976,4.727810650887574

It took some fancy kung fu moves by a group of angels with 14th century Chinese and 16th century Japanese weapons to kill a handful of people after epic battles. Who knew? And I always imagined angels could simply to kill the entire population of cities with their minds as they acted with God's authority. Boy was I wrong on this!

Ugh, I'm embarrassed for your portrayal of Mary. That plastic surgery...the makeup... the lack of anything shared with our Mother. Sorry, but this is truth, and the series lacked any real emotion or anything based in reality. That artistic liberties are perversions and shouldn't be used for anything portraying the Bible. Go to Gibson's The Passion for 'realness.' (As a sidenote:  the producer Mark Burnett comes out of the closet as a Democrat to play political games with Trump. His wife, Roma Downey, however, had no problem using the Fox audience to sell their product. Phonies.

I bought this when it first came out. It is awesome quality. I have never seen any Bible movie 100% true to the written Word of God, and this is also one of those. It is a good overall depiction but not the best. I would suggest if you have never read the Bible, that you do so prior to watching this or any other Bible movie because it would cause you to believe something different.

5452313,5,B00AMR5FGA,"One of the Greatest biblical movies done in years, the production is lavish and great, the direction is first class. This epic miniseries are going to be classic. They treat the biblical history with reverence and faith. For those who laugh at the presence of white people, I would like to laugh at their ignorance and stupidity, since the middle east is made up of semitic and western asiatic people who are white and even blond, the middle east is not africa. Even the North African people are white not black. It is extremely stupid and laughable to leave the biblical history presented with magnificence and speak about the color of the people because that shows a lack of prefrontal cortex that helps the person to assess the information correctly. Roma Downey and her husband should be thanked for such a great production of the Eternal Truth of God's dealings with the human beings regardless of their horrible sins, evil doings, ignorance, filth and their lack of the ability to respond to his perfect Love and Glorious Redemption. Excellent miniseries. We will be waiting for more.",1461715200,,1090,4.865591397849462

The Gospel of John which is 100% accurate gets only 27 stars, while this totally fabricated fantasy series stated to be based on the Bible gets over 4,000 stars. In the very beginning of this series it states : This program is an adaptation of Bible stories. It endeavors to stay true to the spirit of the book. I don't know what book they are talking about, but if the are talking about the Bible, that Spirit is the Holy Spirit.

Although Roma is a sight for sore eyes, I think she was in the series too much. She spent so much time hanging around Jesus and the apostles that, by the time the series ended.

5452409,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I bought the Blu Ray series of The Bible last year around Thanksgiving & I'm happy I did.  I watched it in full & really enjoyed it.  It is one of those series I plan to watch annually around Thanksgiving & Christmas.  In fact I just made it through disc 2 tonight & plan to finish by weeks end so I can start the AD miniseries I picked up over the holiday.

I am far from an expert who claimed to know all about where the inaccuracies are within the miniseries (which I have no doubt there are) but I thought overall the vast majority of the stories stay true to the Bible as I have read it or heard messages on Sunday that echo what is depicted in the movie.  There are parts of the story simply glossed over but I felt the focal parts get covered well.

I agree with several other reviews stating the actor portraying Jesus was amazing.  However, there are many others who acted strong in this movie showing headships, passion, & obediancy.

I am fairly new getting back into religion so after another full year of Sunday messages and watching this time around felt like more of a review than a learning session.  Where I'm going with that is that we are all in different places & I suspect where we are on our journey with God will influence whether this movie reaches us or not.

I would highly recommend!",1448841600,,1310,4.288617886178862
5452410,3,B00AMR5FGA,"I think the producers did a better job with the new testament than the old. That being said there is inaccuracies in both. I know when making a movie liberties need to be taken, but some of them were totally ridiculous.  Example: They don't make judas ( the disciple who betrayed Jesus) as bad and evil as he really was. They almost make it seem like he was tricked into doing it and really didn't want to do it.  They also added another disciple Mary Magdalene. Yes, Mary was close with Jesus, but making her one of the twelve disciples (example: in the boat with the others when Jesus walked on water ect..) is very inaccurate.",1448841600,,629,4.413793103448276
5452411,1,B00AMR5FGA,"This could have been a really good movie/miniseries, if they had followed the bible more closely.

The Bible is the best selling book of all time and Bible stories are always referenced in school/work/life.  If you have not grown up in the church, it can be difficult to know where to start (reading the Bible cover to cover is a bit daunting).  This movie does a great job representing Jesus's life and ministries and follows the order of the books of the Bible.  All the well-known stories are covered in this movie series.  I would give the acting a B+ (some cheesy moments, but not as bad as other Bible dramatizations). This is the best and newest I've found. I'd recommend it.",1442275200,,694,4.3984375

For one, when Abraham contemplated the sacrifice of his son Isaac (as God commanded) I see Sarah running up the hill condemning Abraham and literally making him out to be a fool for the ""faithful and obedient"" sacrifice ... and for another, as Lot (Abraham's nephew) leads the two angels through Sodom you do not see any semblance of homosexuality and or common place violence in the streets ... and last but not least (still in Sodom) when the angels come out of Lots home to disperse the sexual perverts, God's Angels are depicted as some type of ""ninja warriors"" ...

Doesn't have the Gnostic Gospels either and does not tell who Jesus' father was or is because Jesus was the leader of a small cult that got out of hand.

5452519,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I really enjoyed watching this series over the past 2 weeks. It's broken up into 50 minute segments and really tells a great story. It was a lot more violent than I expected, I was hoping to maybe watch it with my daughter but after watching it I think we'll have to put that off for a few years (she's 8 now). Parts of the episodes really put shivers down your spine, the Director and actors did a great job recreating the magic of Christ.",1434326400,,440,4.188235294117647

5452535,4,B00AMR5FGA,Its an awesome movie but only give it four stars. Reason for that is why do they have a black actor playing Sampson?  There wasn't any mention of a negro by the name of Sampson.  Why can't the director stick to the accuracy of the bibleand stop making politically correct movies just to appease a certain race. Of course there are blacks in Eygpt as working with the Pharoahs Sampson was not black.  Other actors look good in the movie except for that portion.,1433376000,,460,4.4523809523809526

I'm shame to give a late review being that I pre-ordered it and received it on it's release date  and just now posting a review, I apologize family people!

There are so many serious omissions -- omissions central to the story of sin and redemption throughout the Bible, which is after all THE STORY of the Bible --  and so many changes from the Biblical narrative and so many misrepresentations and way too much poetic license.  I will not reiterate that which has been very well stated by quite a number of the 197 (as of now) one-star reviewers; but I will urge you to take the time to read some of these comments (you can skip the review that comes up as the ""Most Helpful Critical Review"" - the one by Ondi, dated 4/7/2013).  Prior to purchasing this mini-series, I did not take the time to review the ""minority"" opinions, and as such, I wasted my money and the time -- which I will never get back -- spent watching this horror.  Many of these one-star reviews (now read by me after the fact) are very literate and insightful -- written by those literate not only in the English language but more importantly in the Bible and its message -- and more than adequately and thoroughly explain and document just what's wrong with this latest attempt to make the Bible palatable to the masses and make a buck in the process.  Just because a Bible movie or mini-series gets in excess of 4 stars is no reason to purchase the dvd -- actually, one must wonder why the general public would be so impressed and offer such acclaim.  If the movie were true to the Biblical message, the movie would be about as popular as the true Biblical message has been through the ages and is today, i.e., not very popular at all.  The Bible is not a storybook -- it is God's message to the world about sin and judgment -- the two most important realities in this life -- and His love story to us about His available grace and redemption.  I did not think through this purchase,  I beseech you to think about your possible purchase of this item.  BTW, I have stopped watching this dvd and have tossed it -- not worth keeping since it has few redeeming qualities.",1428192000,3,2212,4.41871921182266

5452638,5,B00AMR5FGA,Best miniseries ever. I watched The Bible at least 10 times since it came out on DVD. I would recommend this show to anybody that believes in God.,1428192000,2,146,4.25
5452639,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I usually don't write reviews - but this series is so bad that it absolutely deserves it. I've only been through the old testament portion of the series so far - and, at least from where I see it, the producers never actually read the Bible before attempting to make a mini series out of it. This series is all about the violence in the old testament and does nothing to explore the characters of the stories or what they represented. It's historically inaccurate, biblically inaccurate and goes around creating it's own version of history. Quite obviously, all the 4 and 5 star reviewers have never once read any of the stories that the series is supposedly based on.

To give specific examples of the inaccuracies:
1. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is completely inaccurate: between Abraham and Lot, Abraham decided that it would be good for the two of them to part ways and let Lot take the pick of the land. By the time God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot's daughters were of marriageable age, certainly not the little kids they were in the series.
2. The story of Abraham's 'almost' sacrifice of Isaac - it's clearly written that the journey to Mt. Moriah was a three day journey, certainly not a small hike that he could have completed in a couple of hours and where he could have been followed by Sarah as soon as she realized what was going to happen.
3. The story of Moses is not bad, but here again, his character is a rather overconfident person who knows exactly what's going to happen as opposed to the real Moses who was diffident and never wanted to go back to Egypt to deal with the Israelites.
4. The story of Samuel - quite obviously, the producers confuse Samuel with Samuel's mentor Eli - who had corrupt sons. The anointing of David as King of Israel - is shown as a rash act performed by Samuel probably because he was angry with Saul's not following orders - in the actual story, the anointing of David is one of the most dramatic moments in Israeli history.
5. Saul and David - again, the period of time between the various episodes in this story are all removed and the entire timeline is ruined.
6. David and Bathsheba - again, if you read the Bible - nothing shown in the series is like what actually happened.
7. Then in a biggest mash up ever - Kind Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom is supposedly taken over by king Cyrus of Persia - and Daniel befriends King Cyrus to convince him to release the jews. Complete historical fallacy.

And I could go on and on - the series is terrible. No one should watch it, let alone buy it - let alone you come away with the impression that the old testament was all about slitting people's throats.",1428105600,3,2658,4.467078189300412

5452675,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The best production about Jess Christ, since ""Jesus of Nazareth"" TV series (1977), beautifully produced, fine direction, nice photograpy, music score by Oscar Winner Hans Zimmer. (Doblada en espaol hispano americano)",1426377600,,216,6.0
5452676,1,B00AMR5FGA,"This movie has the appearance of truth, but there is a lot of added false emotional input, such as Isaac fighting his Dad, Abraham, while he is going to be sacrificed, which wasn't the case. Read the book The Bible, Genesis 22 the whole chapter, it is interesting. Issac only asked where the lamb for sacrifice was. His Dad/Abraham (a man of Great Faith) says, ""God will provide himself a lamb..."" . In the Bible (not the movie) when they get to the place of sacrifice, Isaac is laid upon the altar and Abraham took his knife to slay Issac and the angel of the LORD, ""called"" from Heaven ""Lay not thine hand upon the lad"". God had provided close by, in the thickets, a RAM, not a lamb (as the movie shows) for his sacrifice.  In this movie Isaac is screaming and fighting and a man from the hill calls to Abraham to stop from what he is doing. Another of many problems with this version is that Sarah, Isaac's mother, is running around frantically looking for Issac. Not true, Sarah isn't even mentioned in that chapter. In the 5th verse same chapter 22, Abraham, tells the men with him and Isaac, ""Abide ye here with the donkey; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you"". Abraham was confident that he and Issac were coming back. When a movie like ""The Bible"" wants to make money, they put all kinds of false drama surrounding the real Biblical stories of the Bible, which turns your emotional reactions in the way they want. The Bible (not the movie) is written, in my opinion, to provoke Faith. Almost every event or parable, it is for us to look for Faith, where is it, can you find it?  Some events, show no Faith, and it is evident, others show Great Faith, as in Abraham, knowing in his heart and speaking that Faith to his men, that he and the lad will come again to them, knowing in his heart that he was to sacrifice Isaac. I am not going to keep this movie miniseries version, I bought it because my friend said it was good.  If you have Faith, let it be in ""knowing"" the Truth, by reading the whole Bible from cover to cover, what a challenge that would be. In conclusion: this is my opinion of this miniseries.",1426377600,5,2150,4.316831683168317

5452742,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This is the greatest depiction of the Bible ever made. The parts of the Bible covered include the story of Abraham, Moses, Samson, Daniel and the Birth, death and resurrection nof Jesus Christ. It also covers the Apostles and their influence on spreading the new faith.
This series' strength lies in its ability to thoughtfully and as accurately as possible, tell the stories of the Bible.
The acting was stellar. The special effects were excellent. The attention to the source material was amazing.
You don't get a stylized and over the top drama. You don't get actors with big egos either. You get the Bible as it was meant to be shown.
The score was beautiful and moving as well.",1421884800,2,682,4.691666666666666
5452743,3,B00AMR5FGA,"Our family is watching this series right now and we are about halfway through it. I am impressed with the realism, in people not being overly clean and Anglo looking. It seems to portray how people really lived in Bible times. However, as we watch I am having my children makes notes on the parts that are not Biblical. It is actually quite amazing how far off it can get. I realize that there has to be some artistic license to fill in parts where the Bible doesn't give all the details, but some parts are just simply wrong and give the wrong impression of the Bible. I am not sorry that we are watching and we are having some good family discussions after each session. My children are also going back and reading many of these stories in the Bible to see how it really was. But I will not keep this series after we finish. It is not something we will watch again. I much prefer the Bible Collection series. Most of the ones in that series are much truer to the Bible narrative.",1421884800,,981,4.279569892473118

It's a modern take on the bible with typical American special effects and all that. I don't see how these series are special. I've been researching quite a bit on this topic and there are a lot of things that happened both in bible and with Christianity in general that deserve a lot of attention. Also here you will find not a single mention as one can expect on how Christianity used dirty tactics to achieve their goal of Christianity becoming one supreme religion all over the world. These miniseries are good to refresh memory but not more than that. There are a lot of things wrong with it. I don't have to mention Paganism, now should I? I should also perhaps not mention how some Pagan celebrations were changed and turned into Christian holidays. There is a lot more with where that came from. So say what you will, but this is not the All-loving and all-forgiving god.

5452794,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Warning: You do not have to be a religious zealot to enjoy this series, for one can be an Atheist and really like this modern take on the Biblical stories.  It is in my firm believe this series can be watched and treasured by both traditional Christians, Jews, spiritual people, and more secular folks including Atheists and Agnostics. The adventures, lessons, and values of these ancient tales, especially the New Testament with Jesus are real gems for all mankind, and this series does do it justice (although for my own tastes I did think they toned this a bit down for family audiences, where I would like to see it a more authentic Bible account which in reality is not PG, but rated R.)

Absolutely fantastic epic tv-movie mini series that portrays the old Biblical stories very well.  This modern 21st century version is highly enjoyable, with great special effects, stunts, narration, and loaded with serious character actors from other tv and movie franchises that I love (Indiana Jones, Gladiator, Conan the Barbarian, Game of Thrones, Star Wars & others).

 This series allows for the first time that I have noticed, a direct focus on many of the Genesis stories including Abraham (which was always known to me through reading the Bible itself but rarely portrayed in entertainment media).

 Noah's Ark story moves too quickly and is lacking compared to other renditions, and Exodus is covered too quickly also to make the mini series fit in.  The David story is told well, and Saul and Joshua's details are good.

 The scenes of Daniel did not play at all on my system so there are problems with some of the DVDs.

They covered Sampson and Delilah okay, with some intense fighting and violence (but no sex).  I would have added the sex and nudity in it because THAT was the actual politically incorrect STORY!

 The Genesis details are left out, no history of Caine and Able, nor the third brother Seth at all- No detail on Methusallah the grandfather of Noah, nothing on Lucifer's fall from grace or his failed rebellion against Heaven, nothing on Enoch nor the Giants, and one of the worst things I felt these producers did was they completely LEFT OUT David's son the wise King Solomon & his reign building the temple, and governing Israel.

The details and depictions on the Nativity is awesome, as with their fine portrayal of John the Baptist and Jesus's ministry & finally the crucifixion itself.  Would have liked to have seen some more details on Jesus's wisdom, and a spiritual struggle he went through casting demons out of people (the Demon named Legion).

 This actor plays the role of Jesus very well, with excellent wise quotes from ages; ""Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.""

""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me."",

""For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted."",

""For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"",

""Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."",

""Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to cast a stone."",

""All the commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and so on, are summed up in this single command: You must love your neighbor as yourself.""

 Also I would have liked this series to go on further, and touch into the Post Christ segments of the Bible a little bit with the struggle Peter had, including a whole segment on Revelations (at least these artists interpretation of the story).

  Very enjoyable and worth your time if you are a fan of the Bible and other related genre.",1420329600,,3749,4.646433990895296

5452799,5,B00AMR5FGA,"A truly amazing tv show from History Channel who took great stories from the Bible and turned it into something that speaks to mutiple people who believe in God, Jesus and the Holy Sprit.  I watched all 10 shows and the extras and the show spoke to me and showed me that when you have a passion, desire to achieve something for others to see then you go after it and show those people what is out there.  Many of the special effects made my jaw drop open and I was like this is amazing inculding the scene with the three belivers who are to be burn up by fire by do not burn by the fire, also the scene with parting of the sea truly great scene.  It was also great seeing the actors do such a great job on their character and others interacting together to make the show very powerful.  But also mutiple scenes are very hard to watch but you watch them because its part of the story they are telling of each part of the Bible, for example the last show of Jesus being put to death on the cross and being whipped with leath strap, also not to spoil some scenes but couple of beheading scenes.  But in closing this was a great show and speaks to many people, so if your a believer, or maybe lost your way, still pick this set up and watch it for yourself because I feel even better, stronger Catholic after watching this set and even more changed person as a whole in my life.

5452817,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I don't usually watch Bible movies or read Bible novels, because they're usually so boring and insipid, but this was pretty good. The way I see it now, there are three kinds of Bible movies:

Purist: Goes word-by-word, such as the Gospel of John or The Passion of the Christ.
Interpretive: Stays true to the spirit of the Bible, but allows interpretation and incorporation of outside research. Prince of Egypt, this Bible Miniseries and its derived movie Son of God belong in this category.
Revisionist: Changes the fundamental aspects of the Bible, such as The Last Temptation of Christ.

I prefer the Interpretive movies/novels. Purist is too boring for me, but Interpretive stays true to the Bible, while incorporating some interpretation, outside research, and is also interesting to watch.

This miniseries contains 10 episodes. The first 5 episodes are of the Old Testament, and the last 5 are the New Testament.
Episode 1: ""In the Beginning"": Basically the Book of Genesis. Goes very quickly from Creation to Noah, then narrates the story of Abraham. Includes Lot, the Lord coming to Abraham in the form of 3 angels, destruction of Sodom, and ends with the sacrifice of Isaac. For some reason, Isaac looked a bit like Draco Malfoy to me--he had that Draco Malfoy smirk and was kind of blonde.
Episode 2: ""Exodus"": Just as the title says, this is the story of Exodus. I actually found this episode kind of boring. Prince of Egypt was better.
Episode 3: ""Homeland"": Basically the Book of Judges. Chronicles the taking of the Land of Canaan. Has Joshua, Jericho, Samson, Philistines, and ends with Samuel anointing Saul.
Episode 4: ""Kingdom"": Saul and David.
Episode 5: ""Survival"": Babylonian Exile. Begins with the destruction of Jerusalem, Israelites going into exile, includes Prophet Daniel, the three children in the fire, though in this movie they made them adults, the conquering of Babylon by Cyrus of the Persians (I actually thought Cyrus was pretty cool), Daniel in the lions' den, and the Israelites returning to Jerusalem.

Episode 6: ""Hope"": Beginning of New Testament. Includes the birth of Jesus, John the Baptist, and the calling of Peter.
Episode 7: ""Mission"": Jesus' ministry in Galilee.
Episode 8: ""Betrayal"": Jesus in Jerusalem.
Episode 9: ""Passion""
Episode 10: ""Courage"": Everything that happens after the Resurrection. Includes Saul, his conversion to Christianity, and is now called ""Paul"", and lots of things in the Book of Acts. Ends with John on the island of Patmos.

I loved that they included so much after the resurrection. Also, I liked that they showed daily Jewish life in the temple, daily Roman life in Pilate's residence, and that you could tell the disciples apart. In fact, all the characters in this movie seemed pretty three-dimensional. The Jewish leaders are not demonized. Caiaphas is portrayed as someone who genuinely cares about the welfare of the Jewish people, and does not want the Romans to massacre them. He tries to destroy Jesus because he is afraid that the people will start a rebellion around him which will lead the Romans to destroy the Jewish nation. Pilate and the Romans are portrayed as brutal oppressors. There is one scene in the beginning where Pilate is just entering Judea and he has someone's cart overturned because it was in his way. There is another scene where he has a bunch of Jews beaten up because they were protesting the fact that he took the Temple funds to build the aqueduct.

As one reviewer said, they seem to have taken some scenes out of the DVD which were in the original series. I definitely remember seeing some scenes in ""Son of God"" which were not in the miniseries and should have been. How annoying. Why would they do that?

To sum up, this is an enjoyable movie which stays true to the spirit of the Bible and has great sets and acting. Purists will not like it, however, as it does incorporate some things which a strict constructionist would not put in. I am not a purist, and I think that anyone who is not a purist, or even people who are not Christian, will like this movie.",1418947200,4,4077,4.849137931034483

5452848,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Just a warning to those who care about an accurate portrayal of biblical events.  Many scenes in this series are deliberately changed to paint the characters in a more rosy light than they appear in the actual text.  One example is the scene in Sodom, where the angry mob is banging on Lott's door asking him to send the strangers out. In the video, Lott is standing in front of his daughters evidently trying to shield them from the mob, however in the bible he (a ""righteous"" man in the eyes of God) explicitly offers them up to the mob to be raped (see Genesis 19:8).  The following scene where his daughters both get him drunk and commit incest with him is also omitted, as are the huge majority of genocides and other atrocities commanded by god in the following chapters.  (a list with chapter and verse cited can be found here: http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/04/drunk-with-blood-gods-killings-in-bible.html)  If you have no problem passing on an inaccurately rosy portrayal of biblical events and characters to those watching this series, you will be happy with this DVD.  If however you respect the bible and expect it to be depicted accurately, I cannot recommend it.",1417132800,5,1190,4.984848484848484

5452877,4,B00AMR5FGA,"In this ten-part miniseries, the entire Bible is told in one sweeping narrative from Genesis to Revelation. The first five episodes focus on the Old Testament while the second five cover the New Testament. Not surprisingly, the second half heavily focuses on the life of Jesus.

I found this series to be pretty interesting and entertaining. It is difficult to cram something as long as the Bible into this format, but it manages to get to some of the most important parts. It does move at a pretty fast pace at times to get where it needs to go. For example, from creation until Abraham is mostly just told in a quick montage. Almost necessarily, several stories are skipped. A decent background knowledge of the major characters and their significance is almost required to watch this.

There are some deviations from the exact word of Scripture at times which can be annoying. I felt that the acting at some parts really left a bit to be desired.

All in all, I found this series to be entertaining for both the believer and secular viewer alike.",1415232000,,1049,4.65945945945946

5452898,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I have never been interested in religion before. I am not against it, I just don't follow or believe in it. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the miniseries. It was exciting, interesting, sad, yet happy all at the same time. As I watched, I found myself becoming increasingly more interested in what the differences are between this film and the actual Bible. I love that many stories that us non-followers know vaguely (Samson, Moses, Jesus, and the general concept of God) really come to life. Putting faces to the stories and the action that goes along with each of them truly made me excited to watch each next episode. By the end, I loved the story and the message that the film delivered. I am still not a believer, but this film did raise my curiosity to such a high level that I have since bought an actual copy of The Bible to read and if nothing else, compare the film to the book. I love that I can now speak confidently about many stories of The Bible with those who are religious. Also absorbing the spirit of what God represents can't be a bad thing. I feel that the stories and lessons set very good examples for children and communities. These lessons and examples are portrayed in a colorful, intruiging, and inspiring way in this film. I'm so very glad that I watched this and that I have followed up and read the The Bible itself. Like I said, it has not converted me, but it has caused a spark that raised my interest to levels I have never had before.

Some reviews criticized the accents used by the actors. You have to put that behind you when you watch this (or any other foriegn baed film) because if it was realistic, it would have to be spoken in Hebrew, Italian, and Latin, et al. Just accept some of the more obvious discrepencies and enjoy the nature of the film.

Criticisms:
Casting was poor. Old Mary (who was the co-producer) has way too much plastic surgery to fit in with those times. Also, Paul didn't seem very appropriate.

Due to the condensed nature, many things were forced and didn't make much sense. The best example was when Jesus talked to the little girl upon exiting the temple it really made no sense in the context of the film. Also, his first conversation with Peter was choppy, and didn't seem to explain much. Though these examples were obvious, they probably contributed to my interest in reading the actual Bible to learn what happened in the real version.

Praise:
Ease of understanding. Being at a beginner's level, I was able to follow the stories that were presented without getting lost or mixed up.

Pace. The stories kept a good tempo to keep the viewer interested without too many slow parts.

General lessons presented. The message of God still came through no matter what you like or don't like about the film.",1413417600,3,2779,4.536926147704591

I have watched it a few times so far and I really love it. My only complaint is that I wish they made it a bit longer. This is only a glimpse of the Bible and doesn't tell every story. I think if the producers knew how successful this series was going to be they most likely would have made it longer.  But all projects have budgets and time schedules. Can't ask for everything.

5452960,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Recommended for everybody because there's something for everyone here. Action, drama, romance, it's all here. Not sure why I see so many people complaining about the violence. If you read the Bible you know that violence was very prevalent. This miniseries doesn't sugarcoat anything. Also not sure why Samson being black is such a big deal to a lot of people. It's the story being told that should matter, not the choice of the actor. It has a lot of the classic Bible stories but the Bible is a massive book and obviously ten hours is not enough time to tell all of the stories.",1410652800,,580,4.533333333333333

Then I left it a few weeks and wanted to view the next episodes today, but to my dismay it just do not want to play on my dvd player anymore, it keeps on asking for an area code witch it did not do on the first few episodes. Suddenly my experience and enjoyment of the product purchased totally changed, now it turns into frustration to the point where I feel I will not buy another dvd from this company again. The user interface is extremely complicated asking for registration and my personal details. I did not buy this DVD to share information with a company that will flood me with advertising material. I cannot recommend this method of purchase. The product or the little I could watch was however of the highest quality making the fact that I could not watch it even more frustrating.",1410048000,,891,4.406060606060606

They have actually read the Bible. It is accurate to the parts that it is telling. It is a breathtaking series. The acting is excellent & there seems to be very little use of effects by a computer.
This is a movies that every one should see. I'm given of understand that there are different languages that are used to tell this series of Biblical events. Which is very gratifying to know that there are going to be movie that tell the truth about what the Bible says.
Although it wouldn't have bothered me for it to get more in depth is places but that is probably because I'm more into studying the Bible than most others are. Although'' I should just read the Bible along with studying. This movie helps so do that.

The Bad News: The 4 DVD set is NOT what was shown on TV!
At least 50% of the original programs are missing, sometimes causing confusion.
To market this condensed version as if it were the same as the TV programming is deceptive.
I ordered this far in advance of it's release date from the producers website, wanting to support wholesome programming.
I was shocked, in disbelief, that such a bait and switch would be passed off as , I quote the DVD's label,

Great for family movie and pizza nights. Great if you feel illiterate about the bible and want to know the historic basics so you don't look like an idiot when the topic comes up. Everyone who was not raised going to church every Sunday should see this for basic understanding and of course cool entertainment. Most Christian based movies are really lame. Not this. It's done so well with fantastic characters and pulls you in so you feel like you are there. It is pretty violent in the Old Testament parts, not for kids under 8.

5453057,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I wasn't really interested in this as I am a firm believer (having read the actual written Bible myself) in that old saying, everything looks good, if you don't look to close. Having caused great struggle in my own religious experience with a deep and multi-year study of Christianity, including the history of the church and, of course, source literature, I never considered how I might feel going back so many years later to this particular story, after such conflict was largely resolved. At the time I read the Bible, I grew ever more horrified at the meaning of many of the stories contained within it, to the point of consulting ministers and reverends and even a couple of priests, all of whom told me it was ""allegorical"" or ""not meant to be taken literally"" and my personal favorite ""God is an idea, not a real being. God is in all of us."" After that, for years, I remembered the Bible with, shall we say, annoyance, not anger but not complete forgiveness for the line I'd been sold about being less than a man, etc., and of course incomplete forgiveness for how long it took me to make some peace with the misogyny in the Bible. And then, a friend said, ""you should watch this, you'll love this"" and I genuinely thought he was trying to get me to watch this as some form of extreme or old-fashioned Christian propaganda, having finally found a new way to understand Christianity, and I avoided it.

That having been said, this is not propaganda. No one who does not believe in this story already is in any danger of being converted by this story. If you already believe, I really think it won't hurt you to watch it, unless you look too close or pay too much attention to male / female dynamics, in which case it might hurt your faith, regardless of gender. But, if you already have less faith, little faith or even no faith, this will not change your mind or do anything to sway you toward having more or less respect for Christianity as a religion. If anything, it will only serve to better aid you in understanding the mindset of your more devout, Bible quoting, Christian friends, possibly aiding you in being a better friend to them and possibly even helping you to use their version of religion in your advice-giving and hand-holding of your more literally minded Christian friends. I found myself walking away from this with a better understanding of the mindset of a person who takes the Bible as literally accurate and a reconnection with who I used to be, finding that suddenly I had an understanding of some of the poor choices I had made when I was a different kind of Christian, choices based on a belief that a supernatural being was in charge of everything that was happening around me, focusing intently on me personally, rather than the world at large, and was engaging in some kind of personal crusade against me with the horrors I had suffered, and that he hated women. That understanding helped me to revisit but also to move on in an odd way, helping me to be less hard on myself for making some poor choices and believing things that, in hindsight, made no sense, because, as Maya Angelou would say, I did my best and when I knew better I did better.

This reminder of where I came from also helped me to be more forgiving of my very literally inclined, Bible quoting, Christian friends who have a tendency not to care as much (and sometimes not at all) for non-Christian populations because they believe that their suffering is ordained by their Lord. I confess that I had been getting to a point where I was ready to write certain friends off as being racist or bigoted because of their beliefs and this mini-series reminded of just how deeply they believe in that idea of a master and creator who is actually in charge of each individual life and is purposefully killing people's parents or children or having people raped, a Creator who is visiting horrors upon populations he doesn't approve of. Suddenly, I found that I was being more forgiving of their lack of compassion for those populations they believe their God is harming on purpose but also when they say a child died because God wanted that child to die. I now see God as weeping with me, for me, not as wishing harm upon me, and I still don't approve of their ideas and I don't like how they feel about suffering and I don't have as close a relationship with any of them as I have with friends from more accepting/less judgmental versions of Christianity and even of other religions, but I have been able to maintain respect and affection for several people I was pretty close to abandoning, because I watched this and allowed myself to think of it as a peek inside their minds and hearts, instead of watching it in judgment as some people did.

I think, overall, if you are looking for a better understanding of people who are not what we usually think of as Christian but, rather, very literally minded, old-fashioned Christian, of your very literal-Bible friends, this is beneficial and educational in that it gives a clear insight into the mindset of people who see the world in terms of magic and supernatural powers that have no rules, of a world in which a superior being really can snap metaphorical fingers and bring your lost child back to life, because he is responsible for life and death and everything else, of a being who lets harm come to women because they are so much less than men. It can be difficult to step outside of our own paradigms, having been to a Church with a female minister, before she moved away, having seen the harm that thinking God wants you to suffer can do, and in stepping outside of those paradigms step into a paradigm you have abandoned, or another paradigm, whatever it may be, and try to see inside someone else's mind, inside their beliefs, and find an understanding of how they think and why they see the world the way they do. I really think this miniseries could be very helpful to people like me in seeking to be a better friend. If it makes someone feel better to go sit in the chapel and pray for their mother who is in the hospital room upstairs and they want me to go and sit with them, I go and pray to a slightly different God, but when she dies, I not longer feel the need to say God didn't make that happen. If they believe he did, okay. I am there to support and love them. I wouldn't have been able to be there with all that rhetoric before, because I would have thought they were being heartless to tell their mother that God was making her cancer and she would die when he wants her to. Now, and in fact recently, I am able to see that my friend and his mother both believe that him saying these things and then sitting in the chapel praying to a punishing God is doing more good for her than him sitting at her bedside saying God can't fix everything, the way I would. If for no other reason than this, The Bible was beneficial to watch. That having been said, as a different kind of Christian, I laughed quite a bit of the time and found this highly entertaining on the merits, the script, the acting, the literal translations of allegory and the misogyny. It was well constructed for what it is and entertaining enough. If you watch it with an open mind, not just because it can be hilarious or because you want to prove to yourself that you are right (one way or the other), it will probably help you to better understand your very literally Bible quoting Christian friends, those who see no possibility for any event in life that God does not personally ordain, and to not be so hard on them. They really do believe in a more extreme version of the faith and it helps to keep that in mind.",1405814400,4,7654,4.457917261055635

I am a Christian and I have seen so many versions of Bible stories acted out through movies and television and this one is just so well done, I could not give it less than five stars! The stories encompass the general idea of the stories from Genesis up to the death, resurrection and aftermath of Christ. The only thing I could ask for is MORE episodes. More stories from the Old Testament. There are still so many stories left untold from the Bible that could be brought to life through ""The Bible: series 2 and 3 and 4. ;)",1405468800,2,567,4.3584905660377355

Movies just serve to give us an idea of our Bible accounts and stories.  And, sometimes they can serve as precursors for young Christians before they read the Bible!

5453098,5,B00AMR5FGA,"THE BLU-RAY EDITION VERSUS DVD EDITION:

I bought the DVD version when it first came out. Each of the 10 episodes were different lengths (I.e., 46m, 48m, 50m, 54m, 51m, 45m). Six of the episodes are over 48 minutes.

I recently got the blu-ray edition. I found out that the blu-ray edition was edited differently. Now, every episode is 47 minutes long. That means that the Blu-ray edition is edited differently and shorter in 6 of the episodes.

The DVD starts off with an intro of the Bible that is missing in the Blu-ray version. The Blu-ray starts right at Noah telling the creation account from the Ark with creation scenes mixed in. The DVD has the intro of the Bible first, then creation scenes with Noah telling it. Then we see him in the Ark. This is one example of the different edits between DVD and Blue-ray editions.

Blu-ray will look and sound better then the DVD and be consistently 47 minutes per episode. Six episodes of the DVD version is more than 48 minutes..

IS THE BIBLE THE EPIC MINI SERIES INACCURATE?

Right at the beginning of each episode we are told that its an adaptation of the stories told, but endeavors to keep to the spirit of the book true.

Why an adaptation? History channel only give them 10 hours to do the Bible. So, the stories had to be severally condensed and thus simplified to get the one story that weaves itself through all the stories. This is what creates some Biblical inaccuracies in the stories told.

But, the story that weaves itself through The Bible the Mini Series is the same one that weaves itself through the 1500 years of writing that make up the written Bible. And that one story is what makes the written and mini series both very special. So, The Bible Mini Series is accurate in that sense to the written word.",1404172800,2,1776,4.510903426791277

There are some good performances too (the actor who portrays Jesus does a good job), but some important characters are hard to watch (the actor who portrays Paul is a total miscast!). I prefer not to comment on some of the stories that I watched only once on television, just to see what they were like: I will never watch them again.

But yes, the production is great, the acting is great and it is true to the Bible.

5453123,3,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible is a 10-part mini-series that retells stories from the bible. It starts with the story of Adam and Eve to the events leading to events in the resurrection of Jesus.

There are many great things about this mini-series. The CGI scenes were spectacular. Also,the sound and the cinematography was also worth mentioning. As for the performances,I think that it was good enough overall. But I have to say that was truly impressed with Greg Hicks for his portrayal of Pontius Pilatewas truly exceptional.

As for the things that I didn't like,I felt that the introduction reminding us of the events of the previous episode and the concluding scenes about what is to be expected in the next one took a lot of time in each episode. Also,the stories of important Biblical characters such as Isaac,Jacob and Joseph were not told at all. Added to that,there were many creative license taken by the writers in almost all stories that did not fit well. Although the producers reminded the viewers that they have revised many stories but keep up with the so- called ""Spirit of the Bible"",I felt that there were many stories that were somewhat out of place and lacking credibility. An example of this is the portrayal of Samson.

As for story of Jesus,too bad that many events from his life were somewhat cherry-picked and lacked cohesion with the exception of the Passion and Death of Jesus. Also,most of Jesus' dialogues particularly when teaching the crowd aren't really what was stated from the scriptures. Some Christians may find this not good as well. In summary,some of the revisions that were made just did not seem right. But in spite of the these things, I still find this mini-series great to watch and entertaining. It would have been a lot better if not too many creative licenses were made.",1402012800,,1799,4.796774193548387

5453125,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This is the show that was on TV and it is much nicer than having all the commercial breaks but the editing isn't too hot.  At the end of an episode, it just stops and goes to the next segment without any wrap up.  This was done more like a documentary than a movie.  It is very good for people who don't have a lot of bible knowledge, it does explain things thorough that way.  It's worth the money for kids if for nothing else.",1401753600,,428,4.0

Case in point. The story of the three young Hebrew men and the fiery furnace. In the Bible Daniel is never mentioned. Yet, not only is Daniel present, they have Daniel giving counsel to his friends to consider bowing down to idols. Really? The same Daniel who was willing to risk his life to pray, knowing that it carried a death sentence.

Every story from the 'ninja' angels slicing and dicing their way out of Sodom to Christ coming to 'change the world' (funny - I thought He came to die for our sins experiencing  the death we deserve to have life that He deserves) - not a single story stays true to the Bible.

Spectacular cinematography and great story telling are fine for selling fiction - but not for the Bible!",1400198400,2,910,4.633540372670807

I know a few complained that it wasn't entirely ""on point"" (for instance, they have Simon Peter saying a quote that Jesus actually said), but for me, it's well worth it, just to see Diogo Mogado portray Jesus so human!  He smiles so often, especially when he's around children!  And why not portray him that way; didn't he DIE for us sinners?  If he Loved us, wouldn't he smile when seeing us?

Now I am trying to find out how I can get this one disk ""Disk 2"" replaced since it is outside the return window for Amazon.

5453205,1,B00AMR5FGA,"WILL THE REAL MESSIAH PLEASE STAND UP AND BE RECOGNIZED
 Coming into do a nightshift at work the other night I found the previous shift enjoying one of those rare quiet times we experience as nurses in a hospital. They were sitting around watching something on television and when I asked what they were watching they said it was The Bible miniseries; which seems to be very popular of late around the globe. When they said this there was that usual unspoken little vibe I get from some of my colleagues, where there is just the slightest hint of what could perhaps be labelled amusement at the quaintness of my belief in Jesus as Saviour.
 Knowing a little of this particular production from the writings of authentic and genuine bible scholars I pointed out that this was not really the real story they were watching, informing them that this was yet another Hollywood New Age bible-lite version.
 If their expression had have been vocalized I imagine there would have been a few groans from this group; that, Oh Anthony, cant you just lighten up kind of expression imprinted upon their faces.
 Nevertheless, that is all I said on the subject, (unusual for me I must add), and I went into the staff room to prepare for the shift ahead.
 A little later I did catch about a minute or so of the miniseries as I was passing the TV and in that short amount of time here is what I observed.
 Jesus is in a boat alone with Simon Peter, there is some pretty impressive, emotive sounding music going on to build up the drama of the scene unfolding before me, and leaning down to be face to face with Peter Jesus points his finger toward the shore line, pointing at the world and he says something along the lines of Peter, follow me, and we shall change the whole world.
The emotive music swells to a rather grand level as I walk away to begin my duties.
 And that was all I saw
 If I were not a person who read the bible myself I would be rather impressed with such a statement coming from the actor playing Jesus, what with the wind swept waters and billowing sails and emotional soundtrack, I would venture that I might actually come away quite inspired by what I just witnessed.
 But there are a number of problems with this miniseries, something I was able to pick up in a mere 60 seconds because of having read my bible.
 A: Firstly, and this is nothing new, the Jesus being presented is yet another long haired, hippy Brad Pit lookalike version. The Bible gives very little physical descriptions of our Lord, but the few we do have reveal to us that Jesus was not some handsome looking model type man. In the book of Isaiah we are told: Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Isaiah 53:1-2 There is a reason for every single word and sentence and paragraph and chapter found in the Word of God; The Spirit never wastes a single dot or tittle; we do not for instance have our Lord coming into Mary and Marthas home and saying something like, Ladies, I really love those curtains, they really match your sofa. So when The Spirit inspires Isaiah to write down that Jesus has no form nor comeliness and that there is no beauty that we should desire him, it is for us not to be taken in by such glamorous depictions as what Hollywood seems constantly to be throwing our way. It seems important to the Lord that we follow Him for the right reasons; one of those reasons obviously not being that we follow him because he is pleasant to the sensual eye. How many women would have followed him for all the wrong reasons if He did in fact resemble the movie-dom versions? When Mel Gibsons The Passion was all the rage, homosexual magazines reported many of their readers attending theatres just to catch a glimpse of the actor playing Jesus with his clothes off; which highlights the very point I am trying to make here; people in the flesh are very prone to following someone merely because they are of a comely appearance and this is not the reason to follow the Messiah of Israel.
 B: Jesus is in the miniseries once again portrayed as having long, lavish locks, giving him a somewhat effeminate appearance, rather than the manly kind of man he so obviously was according to scripture; this is the step-son of a carpenter with big, rough carpenters hands, a man spending much time out in the dry, remorseless wildernesses of Galilee and Judea, this is not someone who has just stepped out of the local Hair Salon with a permanent wave and blow-dry we are speaking about here. Ever been camping? How do you look after only a few days out in the elements? Do you look like you just stepped out of a shampoo advertisement? The other thing I think important here is what Paul has to say about men sporting long hair:  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 1st Corinthians 11:14 Now unless Jesus decided to sport long locks as a mark of shame in the same manner He went to the cross, which is also seen as a mark of shame in the bible, then these depictions of the long haired hippy Jesus are completely wrong and we should be wary of them as they once again depict a rather physically gorgeous looking Christ, one that will be listened to and followed for all the wrong reasons; a point of fact that Isaiah is trying to point out to us in chapter 53 of his book.
 C: When Jesus tells Simon Peter in this miniseries that He is here to find followers in order to change the world nothing could be further from the truth when it actually comes to the truth found in the Word of God. If Jesus came to change the world why didn't the world change? Why is it as blood thirty and sin riddled today as it was back then? Why all the wars, including all the so called holy wars? Why all the years of Roman Catholicism oppressing and torturing and murdering all who oppose Mother Church for over a thousand years? Why all the burnings and decapitations carried out by Protestantism for hundreds of years? Why all the slaughter carried out by nearly every country throughout Europe on the Jews century after century? If Jesus came to change the world why has the world gone from bad to worse to almost downright unbearable for the majority of its inhabitants? What changed? The truth is Jesus did not come to change this world as was strongly suggested by this miniseries; we are told in scripture that the world will pass away, that there will one day be a new heavens and a new earth. What is the point of having a new earth if Jesus came to change the earth we now live in? We see what Jesus really came to do if we look at the Gospel of John:  Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. John 18:37 Jesus came to bear witness unto the truth, which means he came to reveal all the lies that send people to hell for the lies they are, those lies spun from times of old by the father of them; all the lies about good works outweighing bad works being a safe path to eternal life in paradise, (which incidentally is foundational to ALL religions outside of authentic bible based Christianity, including the many pseudo-Christian religions so popular in our world today). Jesus came to set the captives free from these lies that will lead countless billions into hell. This was a legal language our Lord was using with Pilate, meaning Jesus was about to put all the religious lies and the robbers and thieves who perpetrate those lies to the masses on trial. Jesus was reiterating what He said in chapter 14 of this very same Gospel account, that all others, and all the paths of others, those myriad paths that supposedly lead to paradise, from the teachings of the Pope to the Imam to the Dali Lama to Joseph Smith to whoever produced this latest miniseries, all of them have been put on trial by Jesus and have been found more than wanting. Jesus did not come here to change a fallen world into an unfallen world; He did not come to make bad people good people, He came to bring dead people back to life; to bring people eternally dead in trespasses and sin back to life eternal to escape hell and end up living with Him in heaven.
 D: Finally, I saw another few minutes of this miniseries today as I was getting ready to go to work and it had Jesus hunkering down to be face level with a child, telling that child in a sing-songy voice that there would not be one stone left upon another of the Jerusalem temple. Jesus playfully pokes this child to emphasize each word he says and he is smiling as the child giggles. To those who know the bible and what our Lord was talking about here, the misrepresentation is as plain as noses on faces. What Jesus is referring to is what began to happen as a result of unbelief of Him as the authentic Messiah in AD66 when the siege of Jerusalem began under the onslaught of the Romans. The destruction was so obliterating that tens of hundreds of thousands of Jews died; they starved to the point that they turned on one another behind those towering walls, they murdered each other, it is reported by the historian Josephus that they even went so far as to eat their own children before being murdered by Rome. The Messiah, the real Messiah, would never have recounted this prophesy in this sing-song manner to a child, telling this child that the temple she was taught by her parents as being foundational to their very lives was about to be destroyed; the child would not have been giggling if he had done this, in fact it would have traumatized this child beyond belief. Jesus did not do this in the bible. He prophesied about the ruin of the temple; that there would no longer be a temple, therefore no more sacrifices of animals would take place to annually atone for the sins of the Jewish people; He was to be the final sacrifice, once for all who would come to believe; therefore what is labelled Judaism today is a false one; there is no other sacrifice to be accepted for the atonement of sins; that sacrifice had been fulfilled by the crucifixion of Yeshua of Nazareth; and one must believe that the ransom  has been delivered , the debt for sin paid in full by the precious blood of the Lamb forevermore in order to be rescued from the approaching flames that have no end.
These inaccurate Hollywood New Age depictions are a dangerous devise devised by dangerous men and women intent on keeping the truth, the biblical truth, even Yeshua Himself, in the dark; to keep this truth from the masses whilst giving them the impression that the truth has in fact been presented to them. And even though some may roll their eyes and inwardly groan, (in and out of church circles), desiring that we who believe the biblical account would just lighten up and wink the eye at such worldly depictions of our Saviour, we must continue to do as our Lord has taught us to do, to bear witness of the truth He came to die for, that truth so unpopular in our world, that truth that saves souls from hell and, hopefully, has heaven one glorious day overflowing.
With Prayers of Shalom-Peace & May you remember me loving you enough to tell you the truth,
Your brother in the Lord Yeshua,
Anthony Donaghey

5453206,3,B00AMR5FGA,Well to start. I don't believe there was Africans in Israel. at these times. this politically correct world is so much lies and deception it makes me sick. other than that it was decent. but with its modern day changes. Meaning it misses the point in many ways. one brief passes through the bible it makes. But what do you expect when non Christian writers write something like this for entertainment. but its worth a watch.,1397952000,2,424,4.592105263157895
5453207,5,B00AMR5FGA,Does anyone know if if the extra 21 minutes of running time on the standard DVD version is from previews that the blu-ray version doesn't have - or is the blu-ray version of the movie shorter?,1397952000,2,192,4.361111111111111
5453208,2,B00AMR5FGA,I bought this at Wal Mart on blu ray.  I watched it all but I didn't like it at all.  Everything thought possible to make about the Bible has been done.  This is just another one of those religious interpretations with British people playing the characters.  It's been done before.  I don't understand why someone just can't make a movie or miniseries about the Bible that's historically accurate like having the characters speak in the original language of the Israelites.  We all know that they didn't speak English.,1397952000,,518,4.829545454545454
5453209,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Can I say that this is the cliff notes to the Bible?

Thinking if this was around years ago when I was in bible study, I might of understood a little more.

Had recorded this on DVR when it was on, and waited for them all to be recorded before watching.  Started watching late one day during one of those weekend snow storms.  Found that I couldn't stop watching and became a marathon session of watching and wasn't going to sleep until after 1:30am on a work night.

Really enjoyed watching what has been talked about for years.  This is a great story that was done without the usual Hollywood ruining the truth.

Liked so much had to purchase to have for the home collection.  Don't go to church much, but still believe and this is making the circuit in the family who have yet to watch.",1397952000,,789,4.319727891156463

5453227,5,B00AMR5FGA,This series is everything I had hoped for and so much more. The producers have done a marvelous job of remaining faithful to the Scriptures and the actors have portrayed their characters with such skill that you cannot help but relate to them.

5453228,2,B00AMR5FGA,We didn't really care for the series. All though it had good production it had a hard time keeping my attention. I attribute that to lack of substance in the stories. I just felt like too much important and relevant information was left out that created the stories in the first place. It was like the goal was to tell the whole bible in 20 words or less. That just doesen't work here.,1397606400,,385,4.287671232876712

5453230,2,B00AMR5FGA,Did not like the mini series.  We were looking forward to it & expectations were high.  It did not measure up & we gave up & did not view the whole thing.  Did not match the bible in some key places.  The older version had outstanding actors & actresses.  This movie was disadvantaged from the beginning.  As a group the actors they look skinny-like in spots.  I guess there was probably some reasons making the mini series the way they did make it?  It was a disappointment to us & we sent it to the reject pile.,1397520000,,513,4.216494845360825

5453234,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I choose this rating because I found that they made the stories came alive and unlike some Christian movies the acting was so natural and believable not stiff. The actors that they chose brought to life the characters they portrayed, I enjoyed watching the entire story.
The only thing I was disappointed in was they did not go deeper into Genesis chapter 6. I think that they gave the impression that the fallen angels, went back to heaven after they repented of their sins which was erroneous for according to scripture their sins were grievious and unforgiveable because they left their original habitation, (they are not like mankind who was made in God's image). Due to the fact were not made in God's image like man they were not qualified for redemption. Apart from this I enjoyed seeing it, I would recommend it, I think it is a
good beginning among the Body of Christ for meaningful discussions  and indept study of the scriptures; also an open door for those who have questions about the bible to get answers to those questions.",1397433600,,1038,4.7032967032967035

This series was so utterly devoid of depth, it is a true mystery to me how anyone (believer or atheist) could rate this show as five stars.  The Bible often lacks detail, but this series takes great pains to remove even that amount of detail in the Bible in order to make room for cheesy action scenes.

5453273,5,B00AMR5FGA,"When this highly rated miniseries first aired on the History Channel in spring 2013, I was unimpressed. I caught a few minutes of the first episode, watched at least one of the Jesus episodes, and concluded that it was mostly flash over substance. But after finally buying the DVD set in March 2014, and watching it all the way through, I'm surprised to say that it's actually quite an impressive series despite its flaws. As a scripture teacher at a Catholic high school, I can now say I highly recommend it as a good visual sampling of the sacred text.

The best thing about this series is that it depicts the entire Bible, in 10 episodes, as one overarching theme of God's love for humanity. There is a continuity of style and theme in the filmmaking that is breathtaking to witness on film, as the video flies through the Hebrew Torah and New Testament with startling narrative drive. Rather than having to rent multiple videos with different actors and technical crews to follow the Bible on film, we've got it all -- well, the greatest hits -- here in one miniseries.

The Old Testament episodes wisely depict God's relationship with humanity through God's five covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David. Some of these episodes are quite good, particularly the deeply moving episode concerning Abraham, which captures his story -- a highlight is the climactic near-sacrifice of his son Isaac -- with poignancy and clarity. Each episode is organized by a theme that holds together disparate Biblical sources remarkably well. The Moses episode is excellent despite ending too abruptly as he returns from Sinai with the commandments, depriving us of the Golden Calf and many other memorable moments. The episodes on Joshua, Samson, King Saul, and King David do a fine job in depicting the rise of Israel's kingdom. But the episode featuring Israel's subjugation under Babylon and Persia carries perhaps the greatest power outside of the Abraham material, giving us iconic renditions of the fiery furnace and Lion's Den captivity stories from the Book of Daniel, with heartfelt performances by the actors playing Daniel and others.

The New Testament episodes slow down quite a bit, minimizing the narration as we come to focus four full episodes on Jesus of Nazareth, with just the tenth and final episode used to squeeze in the Acts of the Apostles and a hint of Revelation. The Jesus episodes are so-so, but the Acts of the Apostles episode at the end of the series is particularly good, inasmuch as one feels the continuity of watching the same actors from the Jesus episodes. I would have liked to see more of the apostolic martyrdom traditions (particularly Peter) depicted rather than just described by the narrator, but it's really neat to see Acts and Revelation building to a climax with the same actors in the same series. By the end, you really feel like you've sampled the whole Bible, albeit the ""greatest hits"" version. It doesn't feel like 9 hours at all and the last disc of this four-disc set even includes a moving ""Mary, Did You Know?"" music video in addition to a helpful documentary feature.

Presentation style is a plus here. The framing device with Noah relating Genesis 1-3 at the start of episode one is clever, reflecting the fact that this primeval history emerges from a symbolic oral storytelling tradition designed to impart religious truth rather than scientific facts. The Hans Zimmer-infused musical score, costumes, and filmmaking all create a theatrical unity to this material. The color-blind casting of the roles (i.e. a black Samson and many middle eastern actors mixed with the British thespians) make the series feel particularly representative of the Middle Eastern melting pot. And the narration by Keith David does a nice job of providing transitions between many stories.

On the negative side, one often feels the absence in this show of what is left out from the Bible, wishing the filmmakers had gone for broke by filming a few more episodes. Cutting straight from Abraham to Moses overlooks the story of Jacob (Israel) and his 12 sons, ancestors of the 12 tribes, and of the particularly moving Joseph story of reconciliation among these brothers that concludes Genesis. Ending the Moses episode right when it was getting really exciting is a bummer. And the story of Solomon, or at least of the division of Israel into a northern and southern kingdom under Solomon's son, would have helped alleviate the narrative incoherence of the rushed effort to portray Babylon's conquest of Jerusalem and the story of the prophet Jeremiah. There's no hint here that the northern kingdom, including prophets like Isaiah and Jonah, ever existed. Finally, I wish the series would have at least acknowledged Alexander the Great and the revolt of the Maccabees (subject of Hanukkah) that re-established an independent Jewish kingdom prior to the Roman conquest in 63 BC. Although most Protestant and Jewish Bibles exile the two books of Maccabees to second-canon status, these events would still help us understand the Roman conquest better.

This brings me to the only weakness of the series, which is its general unevenness. It tries to squeeze the 46 books of the Old Testament into 5 episodes while spreading out the 27 New Testament books over 5 episodes as well. As a result, the Old Testament episodes gradually feel rushed while the New Testament episodes linger over the gospel accounts of Jesus to the exclusion of much other material.

Nevertheless, this series is contemporary enough (John the Baptist has dreds!) and breezy enough (episodes range from 40 to 54 minutes) to be a powerful teaching tool for group study or classroom use. While the excellent TNT Bible Series has richer miniseries teleplays, they tend to be three hours long and frequently padded with extra-biblical material, limiting their classroom use unless one has lots of time to spare. This History Channel series is more like a summary or paraphrase of the Bible, giving us (as the opening scrawl proclaims) the spirit of the text in digestible nuggets rather than word-for-word accuracy. I highly recommend it for teenagers, particularly younger ones, as an entree into the Bible. Older students will want more meat, but this series is more than enough to whet the appetite of spiritual seekers who normally avoid religious material.

I revisited this miniseries after seeing ""Son of God"" in theaters and being favorably impressed with its 2 1/2 hour theatrical cut of the 4 hours of Jesus material from the series. To be candid, I found the Jesus material in ""Son of God"" far more compelling than it is in the miniseries, where it is chopped up over four episodes and dramatically weighed down by the omniscient narration. I found it helpful to purchase the full miniseries DVD set for this reason: The last episode on Acts and Revelation, titled ""Courage,"" makes a great epilogue to watching ""Son of God"" on its own! It feels like a 50-minute sequel to the theatrical film, which is particularly valuable since there are no top-notch films on Acts of the Apostles (only miniseries and low-budget stuff) available to buy.

The Bible Miniseries take on ""Acts of the Apostles"" is not comprehensive, but it hits the major plot points and grows organically out of the Jesus episodes. With so many creaky older Biblical TV films floating around, it's great to have one portable DVD package with visuals from the whole Bible that hold together well in one narrative. This four-disc DVD set in a thin clamshell case is definitely worth owning if you want a visual taste of scripture.",1395705600,2,7611,4.95846394984326

5453276,3,B00AMR5FGA,"The parts that they didn't have wrong or twisted were great. Almost every story part had something wrong.
*SPOILER ALERT*
For example:
-Lot was already living in Sodom when he was captured. (Genesis 14:11,12)
-Abraham, when told to sacrifice Isaac, went three days away to a mountain with Isaac, servants, and donkeys. And it was a ram caught by his horns--NOT a lamb caught by his hind leg. (Genesis 22: 3-13)
-Sarai's name was actually Sara before God promised Isaac would be born, than He changed it. (Genesis 17:15)
-When the Babylonians destroy Jerusalem, a wild-eyed Jeremiah escapes undetected by the invading army. According to the scriptures, however, Jeremiah was captured, bound in chains, and later released (Jeremiah 40:1)
-Additionally, the television show tells of Daniel and his three compatriots being captured during the siege, when in fact, they were deported more than a decade after Jerusalems destruction (Daniel 1; 1 Kings 24:10-16)
-The Bible says the prophet Daniel was thrown into the lions den during the reign of Darius (Daniel 6). In the television show, however, Cyrus is still in power. Also note the keyword THROWN that would suggest that the lion's den was a pit in the ground. Also supporting the idea is that the men (ALL the men--not just one guy) and their wives and children, were thrown in and were tore to pieces before their bodies hit the ground. (Daniel 6:24)
I could go on and on with parts that are wrong. if you want to know more, just let me know and i could get you a list of a lot of things. Also they, in my opinion, left out some of the best parts.
one other part wrong:
the stoning of stephen. he actually didn't get stoned out in the city like that. he had been testifying before the Sanhedrin and they didn't like what they said so THEY--NOT SAUL--dragged him OUTSIDE the city and stoned him while Saul simply stood by and watched over the coats of the killers. (Acts 7:54-60)",1395619200,,1930,4.71301775147929
5453277,2,B00AMR5FGA,"The fact that this was created had me very excited. Visually it was awesome. Music was superb, the actors did a great job. I just did not like how they changed things around to fit. They changed the stories, people were missing and so forth. I guess it was money constraints. The fact that the world needs this i think they should have gone all out and spend the money. Some scenes had me scratching my head. for example The two men that brought the paralytic down through the roof in the bible, in the series Jesus was out side already it wasn't necessary yet thats what they did. It just wasn't done correctly. Either the way the movie inspires and i hope that it pulls people to the pews. The movie is more for evangelicals but as a catholic is was ok. I love roma downey but she did not play a good mary. The plastic surgery in her face just didn't help her play the emotional role well. i prefer the young Mary to look older.  I feel alot was taken from the passion of the Christ which is fine but it wasn't as powerful. Hoping for more of these and looking forward to A.D next year.  Just wish people would just do like Mel Gibson did and put it out there, if done great the money comes back as it did with Mel. Either way its a great tool for the youth to start the conversation.",1395619200,,1286,4.160642570281125

5453296,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This was, hands down the best movie/miniseries that I have ever watched on the Bible. The photography and scenery, visual effects, music, the characters and their personalities, the makeup, clothing and shoes, the places and events were all masterfully created. All the episodes were gems from the Bible and were presented in a realistic, dramatic and believable manner.

This miniseries covered the most well-known stories in the Bible including: creation of the earth as well as Adam and Eve, the covenant of Noah and the ark, God's promises to Abraham as the father of Israel (His chosen people), and the miraculous birth of Abraham's son Isaac, Moses' demands of  Pharaoh to release the Israelites and the plagues that came, the Israelites 40 year wandering through the desert and arrival in the promised land, Moses' parting of the Red Sea, David's conquer of Goliath, the conflicts between David and King Saul, David's rise to kingship and his adultery, Shadrach's, Meshach's and Abednego's triumph over the burning furnace that they were cast into, Daniel's triumph in the Lion's den, Samson and Delilah and the betrayal, Mary's conception of Jesus and his birth, the life and teachings of Jesus, the last supper with Jesus and all his apostles, Jesus' crucifixion, rise from heaven, the spread of Jesus's word through his disciples, Paul's (Saul's) encounter with Jesus on the way to Demascus, Paul's conversion and his missions after Jesus ascended into Heaven, and several other stories.

Most of the time in the miniseries was spent on the New Testament and its characters. My favorite and the most notable characters in my opinion are as follows.

Diogo Morgado was ""Jesus"" and he played this part extremely well. He really drew me in to the person of Jesus with his calm and gentle mannerisms. Roma Downey (one of the Executive Producers of the miniseries) played Jesus' ""Mother Mary."" Morgado and Downey had amazing chemistry on screen and portrayed the ultimate bond of love between mother and son.

Amber Rose Revah played ""Mary Magdalene"", one of Jesus' apostles. Mary was not portrayed as a prostitute, but rather a follower and at times a guide. The producers put extra emphasis on the character of Mary Magdalene as she was shown center stage and with various apostles quite a bit. However, she did not have a lot of speaking lines.

Con O'Neill played Saul, persecutor of Jesus' followers. Saul was converted to Christianity and became a follower of Jesus on the road to Damascus. When Saul began to provide Christian teachings to the Gentiles, he began to go by the Latin form of his name, which was Paul. O'Neill played the role of persecutor and saint convincingly well.",1395187200,,2694,4.988864142538976

5453308,1,B00AMR5FGA,"There used to be an old saying ""Don't Pee (p..st) on my head and tell me it's rain/ing!  It may be a gross analogy but this is what it felt like watching this so-called Bible Epic Miniseries. Do they not know anyone can pick up a Christian Bible with a concordance and study Bible to find revisions of relevant Bible events they altered in this film? Yet they are promoting this like it is THE BIBLE! In scene after scene important details were left out, or changed and it gets worst in the New Testament!  How could  the Producers change one of the most beautiful events in the bible, where Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus. They changed it where Jesus went into the tomb, talked to Lazarus and bought him out without weeping outside with the crowd like the Bible tells it. Who would do that that loves the real Bible?

I'm also concerned  this film has a dark Satan confronting Jesus. However scriptures tell us Satan transforms as an Angel of Light. Yet the Lucifer in this film resembles an aging 70 year old Obama , which they had the good sense to delete from the recent Son of God film for Television viewers  but worst than that was most all of the Jews in opposition to Jesus are more ethnic as in Middle Eastern looking. It may give the impression of negative racial stereotyping people of color, without intending to do so. You don't win persons to Christ when your message looks like a negative promo against them! Seems like that would be commonsense logic.

The church at large may be in trouble if most are willing to compromise on Biblical truths and support movies that are promoted as the authentic Bible but are not.

Seems as if anyone can slap a Christian label on anything and it is shocking how many calling themselves Christians follow, whether it lines up with the Word, or not. Change a little here and a little there and you have a whole other story.  Termites within can eat away at any foundation.

I cannot give a high rating for important words & actions put in my Savior's mouth and the Old Testament Prophets that they did not say or do. For this reason I gave this Bible Epic Miniseries one star. My suggestion for those who want the real deal is to read the actual Bible, or find the Films produced by the VISUAL Bible, especially The Gospel of John and The Gospel of Matthew. Both of their actors were more believable as Jesus and closer to what a  Middle Eastern Jew of Hebrew descent may have looked like.

Much is left out, and much is condensed. But what is presented is presented well. It is engaging, engrossing, entertaining, and enlightening. It is beautiful and bold. It is ""The Ten Commandments"" meets ""The Passion of the Christ.""

The last 4 episodes follow the Gospel of Luke, and the Acts of the Apostles. The show dramatizes the story of Jesus in a realistic and believable way, far better and far more enjoyably than any similar work I have seen. The part covering Jesus' last week in Jerusalem is extraordinarily well done. The scenes related to Christ's Passion are heart breaking. Jesus becomes more ""human"" in this film than in any other I have seen. But the movie does not end with the crucifixion.

5453372,1,B00AMR5FGA,"If you have never read the Bible, do not think for one second that watching this abomination will give you anything close to a good understanding of what the Bible teaches. I've only watched disk one of four so far that I borrowed from my church, which is a Bible believing church, but for some odd reason wound up buying this movie. If you are a Christian(as I am) you may want to borrow this video sometime, rather than wasting any money on nonsense such as this, just so you can speak with people that may know a lot about this movie but not much about what the Bible actually teaches. Unfortunately I have already made arrangements to watch the Son of God movie that came right out of this series with my pastor and others this Wednesday, so I am hoping that they managed to get the New Testament a whole lot better that they have done the Old, otherwise me, my pastor and our whole church may be having some big discussions triggered by this nonsense. But God does cause all things to work together for good, for those that love Him Romans 8:28. I may be adding to this review later.

Now I have watched disc 2 of 4 and it is crazy how carefree these guys were about flippantly adding to and taking away from what the Bible teaches. Disc 2 has already started covering a bit of the life of Jesus and I now know in advance that I will be wasting money to see this Son of God movie, but maybe I'll do a video review of that for the internet, they showed the temptation of Christ and it was interesting how Jesus avoided saying ""It is written"" or giving any allusions that He was directly quoting from the word of God to answer the very obviously demonic evil looking Satan.
update 3/6/2014
What bothers me the most with the Bible Miniseries is that most of the believers in God come across as nearly delusional, almost like they have the make believe friend that atheists would like to accuse anyone who believes in God of having. The Son of God movie was not as bad as I had feared, I would not discourage people from seeing that movie, though it does have some scenes that are not directly in line with Biblical teachings. I liked the way the Son of God Movie wrapped up and its closing song ""Mary did you know"". There are not a lot of direct contradictions in this series, but a lot of misleading scenes. The Ark scenes showed a very leaky ark. When Abraham offered his son(not actually killing him of course) the series made it look like he and Isaac went straight from home to the mountain alone. When Moses leads the children of Israel out of Egypt the ten plagues were done very strangely in the movie, Moses turns the water to blood as pharaoh is bathing in the water. The crossing of the red sea is weird with what looks like about three hundred people making up the children of Israel needing to quickly pass through the parted Red Sea with the Egyptians right behind them. In the series and also in the Son of God movie Jesus enters the tomb and kisses Lazarus on the forehead to raise him from the dead. The Bible indicates Jesus was outside of the tomb and called Lazarus forth, he came out tomb with his grave clothes and head covering still on and Jesus had those who witnessed this loose him from the clothes. I would recommend that if possible borrow this series from someone and watch it. It is worth seeing I believe, but not worth buying.",1393718400,6,3361,4.343402225755167

Forgiving, compassionate, reverent and respectful is who he is and was as a mortal. Just as he said to Peter, ""many say yes to God but few live his will"". If you want an easier life here on Earth, live his will. His will is Agape (unconditional) Love. That is when you love every living thing as much as yourself and even more.

It will now be an seasonal must see every year.,1391731200,,328,4.030769230769231
5453629,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I remember hearing so many people rant and rave about how great this series was. The producers even came to Liberty University a few weeks ago talking about this and the upcoming ""Son of God"" movie, so I was pretty excited to see this for myself. I have watched all of the episodes. I am quite honestly very concerned with how this may have presented God to millions of people worldwide.

The show seems to me to be primarily concerned with entertaining the audience. There were unnecessary fight scenes, added drama, and extra plot fillers that quite frankly, took away from the story more than they added. Often throughout the entire series the show contradicted what was written in the Scriptures (Examples: The people of Sodom were trying to sexually assault the angels, not beat them up, and the angelic kung-fu was unnecessary; Judas was not a really nice guy who was duped into betraying Jesus. He was in charge of the money bag but was embezzling money the whole time and then sought to betray him). The depth and lessons behind each account in the Bible were glossed over or altogether omitted, and the character of God was in no way revealed throughout the Old Testament episodes. If the viewer had no prior knowledge of the Bible, he would think that the Old Testament was just one big blood-bath.
Many  don't understand God's motives and actions in the OT because we focus on the judgment. But If you read the Old Testament, God explains why He does many of the things that He did back then. The Israelites were an instrument of God's judgment because the Canaanites worshiped demons, burned children as sacrifices to 'Molech', drank blood, and practiced witchcraft. Additionally, sexual deviance was rampant. Men would sleep with their mothers, sisters, daughters, aunts, in-laws, and even animals. Men were with men, women were with women, and they engaged in open prostitution (sometimes as a form of worship in their temples), and sometimes even forced their own daughters into prostitution. This list is by no means comprehensive. So if you think that's bad, there was still more. God gave them four hundred years to repent and they did not. Because of all these things God kicked them out of the land and gave it to the Israelites. Now back to the story:

There was a huge amount of content omitted from the New Testament, which is understandable I guess, if you can only summarize it all in roughly 5 hours. I'm not making a big deal out of that. But the concern stems from the fact that each account of Jesus' life and ministry was so reconstructed and tweaked that it was hardly comparable to the actual book. In fact, everyone's dialogue and actions deviate quite a bit from the real story. The beginning of each episode says that the show ""endeavors to stay true to the spirit of the book"". I think this is only lip-service. They changed words, conversations, and events for art's sake, which made the New Testament section very inaccurate. People at that time, like you and me, said what they said for a reason. If you add or take away words, or completely create new conversations (which happened often), you lose the context and the speaker's intended meaning. And if you add, subtract, and change historical events for dramatic effect or creative liberality, it ceases to be a reliable and accurate source of information and truth. Just ask yourself, if the spirit of the show is entertainment and artistic reinterpretation, is that the same spirit that the Bible was written in?

I know that no one can portray Jesus perfectly. But here, I felt that He wasn't just imperfectly represented, He was misrepresented. In this series, Jesus heals a bunch of people and draws a lot of attention to himself. In reality, Jesus did not seek to draw attention to Himself, and performing miracles was not his main interest. He was all about teaching people about who God really is, what true righteousness really is, rebuking religiosity, proclaiming truth, commanding repentance that leads life, and pointing people back to God, His father. But Jesus' words were severely altered, so that many of the most important things that He said were left out, and the teaching that was left was mostly paraphrased and reinterpreted (incorrectly). I suspect that this was done so that no one was offended. Jesus told a lot of people that they were wrong. That offended them so much that they murdered Him. Considering that we naturally aren't much different than them (human I mean), I'm pretty sure His words would have offended quite a few people today.

While  for the creators of this series, this was said to be an attempt to present the Gospel to the world, I think they just made the Gospel more presentable to the world: the Gospel that was preached in the series had no power. We were never told why Jesus had to die or why He rose again. If you don't know anything about the Bible, why would you care if a nice guy got killed and then came back? What does that even mean? And after Jesus ascended, all the disciples were saying was: ""Jesus is alive! He is the Messiah!"". Not that those things aren't true, or part of the Gospel, but it is less than half of the entire message. Because the message is offensive. People weren't martyred, persecuted, and hated back then because they believed in a religion, but because they told you that you were wrong and that they had found truth:

You have a great problem, a terrifying problem.  God is good, and you are evil.  And because He is good, and loving, He must deal with evil, loveless people like you and me. A human is a depraved creature, he is morally corrupt, and he is Hell-bent on autonomy and self-will, even if it means his own destruction (and it does). He hates God because God is righteous, and he hates God's laws because they censor him and restrict his evil. He hates the truth because it exposes him for what he is and troubles what is left of his conscience. Therefore fallen man seeks to push the truth--especially the truth about God--as far from him as he can possibly remove it. He will go to any extent to suppress the truth, even to the point of pretending that there is no such thing as truth, or that if it does exist, it cannot be known or have any bearing on our lives. So when a man ""gets saved"", he gets saved from God. The justice of God is coming for you. And there is nothing we can do to be good in our own power, because we are enslaved to our own passions and desires. They are too powerful for us to resist. We live in misery, slavery, guilt, wickedness, and condemnation. And without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.

But God's love is so amazing that He has the capacity to express love even to the objects of His hatred and wrath. So He clothes Himself in a human form, to teach us about God and offer His own life and blood. Jesus allowed Himself to be accused, ridiculed, tortured, abused, and nailed to a piece of wood, naked, only to be crushed under the full weight of His Father's wrath as He bleeding and suffocating to death. Why? So that God would not have to kill you and cast your soul into Hell for all of eternity. The best part of this is that Jesus laid down His life willingly, and God sacrificed His son willingly. They were not in disagreement in what it would take to save you. They knew what it would cost, and they desired to do it in love for you. Every person on Earth, yes, but specifically, for YOU.

The Spirit of God affirmed to all that Jesus was the Son of God by raising Him from the dead, and showing us that in Christ we would die to our old selves and live new lives. And that is not poetry. We do not need to become better people, we need to be literally transformed into new creatures. So God saved you from Himself, God saved you for Himself, and God saved you by Himself. You are miserable because your life revolves around grabbing at whatever vain, empty pleasure you think will satisfy the emptiness that comes from all of your unmet desires. The only thing that can satisfy you is Jesus. And the more of the world you forsake, the more of Him you can have. God is a real person, not a concept. You can feel, love, and know God every day, and He will never leave you or cast you away. In Him is your only hope of forgiveness, redemption, freedom, joy, love, and life. Eternal life begins now, and it is worth giving up everything to obtain it. Abandon all hope in any other god, good dead, or philosophy. Repent and believe in Jesus, the one who was sent from God to reveal God and reconcile men back to God. But to those who hate God even though He has done all this for us, even though we were ill-deserving, not just undeserving, it leaves a horrifying question: If God didn't spare His own son, what do you think He'll do to you? And what do you have to gain by trying to do everything in your own power and grab whatever you can on this temporary planet? You will lose your life, your soul, your pride, your joy, and everything you hoped to gain in rejecting God.

That message is hated even today.

I'm worried that God was not revealed. I'm sad that the world did not learn more about Jesus. I'm appalled that truth was watered down. I'm horrified that the Gospel was not preached. We've traded depth and meaning for cheap entertainment. And I'm concerned that so many Christians didn't even seem to notice.",1391644800,141,9379,4.522995283018868

The guy who played Jesus was visually handsome, but I don't really like thinking of Jesus as handsome...do you?  He was obviously going for a ""sympathetic"" tone and to ME came across more as a whiney, sad guy.  A little too sensitive for Jesus, if that makes sense.  THAT SAID, I'm still glad this movie was made.  There is so much garbage out there for folks to inebriate themselves with...and this was a pretty dang good presentation.",1390435200,2,590,4.509433962264151

Did I miss that in the credits? Also they showed nothing of Revelation probably because Hollywood couldn't handle it.
Mary Magdalene was never a  part of the twelve with Jesus.
According to the Bible, Jesus mother has no lines after she speaks to her son at the wedding at Cana, but in the movie she say ""My son, my son"" probably 10x or more. Morally, that is really bull. It is God that is saying My Son!

5454096,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Great acting and whole Bible coverage.

Removed one star for not having enough information between segments to tie it all together on a timeline.  Easy for someone who already knows Bible history, but not as much so for someone learning for the first time.  Also, there are a few liberties taken I didn't care for.  The wise men were depicted as royalty and as having arrived in Bethlehem just after Jesus was born, seemingly a nod to cultural assumptions.  The ""ram in the thicket caught by its horns"" provided for Abraham was shown as a bleating lamb nearby.  Not a big deal theologically speaking, but it bugged me, what can I say.  Theologically speaking, I believe they could have done a better job with communicating that Jesus paid for our sin by dying and rising from the dead because ""the wages of sin is death,"" and God requires that someone pay by dying for our sin - us or, if we ask, Jesus.  You'd have to read into it to figure that out...if at all, but I got a sense that they did try to convey the overall Message, the Good News of the Gospel.

However, it does deserve the 4 stars for accuracy and overall quality.  I especially enjoyed the scene of Jesus being tempted in the dessert; very real imagery, it seems to me (can't know for sure, of course).  Effects were good, too; you could almost feel the nails being driven into the crosses...and your heart.

It brought history to life as only good cinema can.",1389571200,5,1428,4.471042471042471

5454209,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Incredibly surprised at all the positive ratings. I found this series to be lacking in many ways. It is truly whitewashed...nearly all the lead characters are white English actors, yet the background masses are locals, Moroccan or Arab, where the majority of the production was filmed. This alone creates a huge gap of credibility for me.  Given the landscape chosen to depict the holy land, all the English characters appeared grossly out of place. And the series may be ambitious in scope, but epic??? Not even close. Most of the individual stories are superficial in their portrayals, and many equally important bible stories were glossed over or even omitted. It's okay to present select parts of the Bible, but please, let's not call it epic. Many details of the individual stories were altered or embellished for, I suppose, dramatic effect, thus the need for a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode, always a warning that the content will be altered beyond the approval of many.  I did like some of the special effects, the burning bush was captivating.  And I did find a few moments of inspiration throughout the series. But in other places, the story was just plain painful to watch, almost embarrassing.",1388707200,7,1219,4.9365853658536585

5454213,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I am a Christian and go to a Christian college, so let me say that this series is not biblically accurate. Many scenes did not happen the way the bible portrays them (i won't even list them). However, the basic story lines are correct and the graphics are so good that it is a breath of fresh air from the 1970's classics and cheaply done Christian films we have now. Atleast I can picture what the parting of the Red Sea probably looked like and this series does that. Some of the reactions from people was not realistic, such as the raising of Lazurus with people just smiling, Malcus having his ear healed by Jesus yet acting like nothing happened (ridiculous). So, this series is good if you have no idea about anything about the bible and this can spark your interest. However, if you are a student of the bible and take it seriously then you will see the inaccuracies across the board. I wish it was more accurate because the stuff they could have fixed are simple but i am happy we have a modern day version visual of some stories. I also don't get skipping certain people and focusing scenes on others, where is King Solomon, atleast one of the minor prophets, etc.? Hope they make another with other stories and more accuracy. If it was accurate id give it 5 stars.",1388707200,,1274,4.425531914893617

5454312,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I loved watching the Bible! Its amazing that they finally created a movie that translates the entire movie and I love that they have a theme that persists throughout the sequential 10 episodes. The children of God are constantly persecuted and the world is corrupted with sin and each prophet forsees the coming of the Messiah, which leads up to the coming of Jesus. And I also really love that this adaptation continues  the story after Jesus' crucifixion to tell the work of the apostles, especially Paul. I never knew these stories occured because the bible is hard for me to read but Im glad I know now thanks to this DVD. The scenes get very emotional and make you remember God is with you wherever and whenever. I often brag that I have this DVD set! I love it!",1388620800,,767,4.478571428571429

5454375,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This is an awesome mini series, sure to be a classic for years to come. It takes you through some of the highlights of the Bible... of course they couldn't tell every story, but it includes many of the ""famous"" ones. I wouldn't say every detail of the movie is in sync with the Bible, but as they put in the disclaimer- they tried to stay true to the spirit of the message and I feel they did in fact do that.

I bought this DVD set as a Christmas gift for my nine year old son. If you are going to let a child watch it, I would view it first and then make a decision. I watched it when it came on TV first and originally decided that I was not going to let him see it until he was older due to the violence... and because frankly you have to be careful of what Hollywood decides is appropriate. However, I changed my mind and I'm glad that he was able to see the Bible come to life.... I think that the positive impact is what is most important- and he loved it, we watched the whole whole set in one weekend.

Also... I had seen a couple of reviews state that the whole original series that was on TV is not on the DVD.... I watched it when it came on TV and can not think of anything that was left out. I did notice that you have to be careful when you change DVDs.... we accidentally watched the 2nd disc without realizing that we didn't finish the 1st one... and then had to back track. Make sure you watch (or fast forward) through the credits on each episode to get to the next one because they are not on the main menu screen- which is confusing.",1388448000,,1554,4.009677419354839

She curled into me and I whispered in her ear what was happening and why. She is a very curious child and this movie is a great way to share with family and friends a scenic view of the Bible.

5454382,5,B00AMR5FGA,"IGNORE THE ONE STAR PEOPLE!

I am educated in the bible and know quite a bit of word for word with these stories told in this film. I and many people understand to fit the entire bible into TV or movies is just plain crazy talk. The old testament alone would be a HUGE box set and would take a better part of a year to watch it all. Yes, things, teachings, and sayings are left out.

Here is the best part. This film gives people, many of which have little to no knowledge of the bible, a way to get excited, and hear about our Lord. It also gives those visual learners a feel for what it was like and give depth to his/her reading. I highly doubt Jesus would oppose this and also warns in his teachings to not be critical with things such as this.

I feel that this is a wonderful addition for anyone to own and gives a fresh look and glimpse into the most lives of the most famous people in Biblical history. Being a father, I can read the story of Abraham and having to sacrifice his son and get pretty emotional, but when seeing it like this, it ramped it way up and could feel the emotions clearer than reading; as an example. You can be very critical about it and harden your heart or you can let the Holy Spirit fill you with joy and marvel at God's brilliance.

May God bless all that are involved with this film and in turn, giving the world a new look and a fresh look into God's marvelous plan.",1388275200,3,1405,4.098181818181819

I was since told that you need to FF through the credits in order to see the rest of the episodes on each DVD.  It would have been helpful if they would have listed and put the total # of episodes on each DVD or even the # of total minutes of showtime on each DVD.  It was very confusing.

Overall this was very well done and puts a very human emotional face on each of the Biblical characters we have read about.  When we read about Moses and the slaves we forget these are real people with real fears and the producers did a very good job of portraying this.",1388275200,2,655,4.125984251968504

From start to finish, I was thinking about how many people that didn't know the Lord were watching this and prayed to myself for those who weren't saved. I read a review earlier of someone complaining about the warrior angels that helped Lot's family escape. One was black and the other was Asian. I liked it, because it shows God embraces all races and we are all made in God's image. Also, Lot's family had to be protected to escape. We don't know how they protected them. They were warrior angels, so they could fight. LOVED IT! I would have loved to see Elijah and Gideon, but I can deal with Samson and Daniel. Well Done!",1388016000,,698,4.4609375

5454523,1,B00AMR5FGA,"First of all why on earth are so many people promoting this series?

Other negative reviews have went into all the specifics on where this series falls short so I will not do that.  I will just say that this film is a Liberal portrayal of the Bible. It seems it was made for profit not for faith.  I mean the history channel picked it up and we all know the history channel knows nothing about real history.  Its the same Anti-christian channel which attacks our Lord even during our Holy days and says sensational idiotic things.  History channel should stick with pawn stars instead of all the lies including this miniseries. And the creator of this is just some rich Hollywood producer Mark Burnett who knows nothing about the faith he went to very bad theological sources just for help.  And any one (mark) who puts millions of money making this clearly picked up the Bible and noticed that this is not accurate at all.  The producers Mark Burnett and his wife (who were married a few years go in a civil ceremony with no church or priest) knew better but did not care about Scripture or portraying Christianity accurately.

This film has a ridiculous amount of inaccuracies but even in the beginning of this film it left out the part of how Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed mainly because homosexual behavior aka sodomy and obliviously that is how the city got its name.  And also in the bible Homosexual Man (Sodomites) were trying to sexually abuse the angels who were appearing as man in the Bible but the angels blinded them.
None of that is in series instead we see angel ninjas that were not trying to be sexually abused but instead were just practicing their martial arts.  I'm assuming both the producers and history channel did not want to show homosexual behavior in a negative way (the correct way) which is typical liberal propaganda and they also wanted as much money as possible so they added a ninja scene.

But again this is just once part of the series the list is vast.  Stay away from this people!",1387843200,5,2021,4.56786703601108

The writers have not only taken so many liberties with the bible to make this movie ""agreeable"" to a new audience, but it also changes and/or leaves out so much important aspects of the Bible that it shouldn't even be sold in Christian book stores. This would actually be a great chance to bring to a Bible Study class so you can correct this TV mini-series from the Bible in each lesson and learn correctly.  I was really disheartened from the first hour on, and am painfully repulsed by the blatant disregard for biblical accuracy on so many parts. Very sad that prior to the release, the producers repeatedly promoted this mini-series as biblically accurate and stressed the use of many well-known Bible Scholors to ensure it reflects as accurately as humanly possible...I'm here to tell you...it is not even close.

The quality is superb and the way the stories of the Bible are told is excellent.  This DVD is a good learning tool for discussion on the Bible with children or anyone interested in learning more.  I was disappointed it did not receive the Movie of the Year from the Emmy's (instead of the life of Liberace, oh boy), because this was an amazing feat to show this for four weeks on national television, and reading the positive comments from people on Facebook and Twitter.  Worth every cent!",1387238400,,605,4.522935779816514
5454691,4,B00AMR5FGA,"My husband and I enjoyed this immensely. It is not 100% accurate and the parts that were off annoyed me. For instance..
The bible states very clearly that the men of Sodom and Gomorrah desired sexual relations with the angels. The film leaves that out and just shows angels having a weird ninja fight scene for no real reason.
Jesus SPOKE to Lazarus from outside the tomb and called him back to life. Why they didn't portray it this way is strange to me because the other way would have been more dramatic and accurate.
Sampson was not Aa black man. Sampson was a JEW.
Why did the ark leak?

If you can get past some of this... the scenes are beautiful. The special effects are fantastic. It is very moving. Just beware that politically correct Hollywood had their dirty little fingers in it.",1387152000,,792,4.5

5454694,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I thought this was an incredibly well-made production, the best anyone has produced around the Bible so far. One of my biggest concerns, though, about the movie was how Sodom & Gomorrah was dealt with. I saw this episode on TV, not on the Blu-Ray that I later purchased, so I don't know if this detail was filled in or not, but my beef was that the wickedness in the city where the two angels had to show up and escort Lot's family out was not properly explained. In the episode, the city folk showed up with swords and just started bashing. That's NOT what the Bible says. The Bible says that they were very, very much intent on having homosexual sex with the handsome angels. In fact, the men in the city, young and old and from every corner of the city, surrounded his home trying to get these two handsome looking angels to come out because they wanted to boink them. It is true they got violent about it but the real intent was rape, not the sword. Lot even offered them his daughters, but no, they wanted to boink the angels whom they thought were men. The city of Sodom is where we get the modern English term ""sodomy"". It was clearly purely out of political correctness that this major detail was left out.",1387065600,10,1214,4.352422907488987

It is a basic, yet exciting series and definately has a steel backbone of the bible.  For a bible study purpose, (my initial reason for wanting to see this film)  I realize now when I read the scripture, the series does not completely cover some of the events but that would be impossible in 10 hours to do.

The part about Sodom and Gomorrah was glossed over so much that no one would know that the real abomination that caused their destruction was homosexuality!  There was too much time spent on the fight scenes and not enough on the real message of the Bible.  Bible study groups could use this mini-series for a discussion of ""what's left out of this film""!
  I realize that the realities of modern America would have brought down the wrath of the street mobs on the producers' heads if they had presented the whole truth in this production.  Other forms of media will have to get the job done!  I would rate the miniseries  C or C- !",1386460800,,731,4.443609022556391
5454784,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I know it's hard to condense the material and maintain a narrative, but the script was a bit cheesy. I'm not sure if it really stays ""true to text"" or more ""true to very conservative preachy views"" as you definitely feel a preachy vibe from the dialogue.

Also, there is a lack of character depth and editing that sometimes seems...off. The kung-fu angels were a bit much, pretty sure that's not how it happened. It's not that I think its bad, I just feel sad that with all the effort and money thrown into this that casting a better director and writer could have really improved this to very good. Because, really, the story deserves that.

Overall, its worthwhile and a good effort at getting a lot of biblical stories filmed. I hope there's a version 2 that is less preachy, better directed, and more focused (perhaps a multi-season miniseries).",1386374400,,849,4.653333333333333

It was very violent but hey that's what happened back then. I didn't know that Sampson was black, I always thought he was white but the casting of Nonzo makes more sense now. The only hint of a relationship between Jesus and Mary Magellan was the scene between her and his mother Mary. A few things I found really disturbing and hard to watch is the attempted murder of Isaac, Abraham  was truly a psycho, God would not tell someone to kill their own child, I also did not like watching N'ver canvasser chained up like a dog, was that necessary? The special effects were sheer genius, the parting of the red sea was beautiful to watch, the only problem I had was I could hear Moses say ""Follow Me"" but did not see his mouth move. Another great part was watching the meeting of Jesus and Peter, I felt Peter's reaction was realistic, and relatable, I would have reacted the same way if some random guy decided to jump into my boat. The acting this series in my opinion is all award worthy.  One thing that I want to mention is that I still hide under the covers during Daniel in the lion's den and when the other guy gets thrown in there too.",1386374400,,1294,4.316872427983539

5454791,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Cannot recommend.
When Touched By An Angel actor was the big push for this film, we knew it was going to be the sloppy-grace edition of God. But what we didn't anticipate (after hearing Glenn Beck-n-staff & some friends of ours say it was ""pretty good"") was the inaccuracies, replacements, and over-acted Hollywood fantasy-land content.  <sigh> It's shameful.

We bought on Roku, in case it was a big  disappointment and went against the Bible/Word of HaShem (The LORD).  Horrible content.

People in Entertainment or ""The Arts"" like to say that they utilize ""poetic license"" as they manipulate or tweak (or twist) originally texts/sources available. It's a very liberal point of view. But HaShem says to us very clearly in both the Tenakh & also in the Apostolic Writings that we are NOT allowed to add or take away from all that is written (to the best of what we can find, have, can discover, and see in the Scriptures).  Sloppy-grace approachers often ignore this Instruction from God in His Word, to their own desire very often, and to their own spiritual peril (per HaShem Himself).

The Master (Yeshua/Jesus) would be, and is, angered as well as ashamed by these type of works/productions. Sloppy-gracers will claim these type of productions will ""save souls,"" but they say that about almost anything they FEEL would work.....verses what HaShem's Word says is a reality.  <sigh>

We say.....warn others appropriately, and DON'T BUY if you want to try to keep falsehood out of your thoughts and memory banks.

Obviously, there are parts that are somewhat off base but this is a very well done series of bible events which certainly had to take a tremendous effort in order to put it together.  I am very, very appreciative to the individuals who put this together.  I'm sure there must have been many moments when they wondered if they had put too much on their plate.  The reality is they stuck with it and the end result is a wonderful series of Bible events which lead up to the life and crucifixion of the one and the only one who was able to die on the cross and shed his wonderful blood so that whosoever will confess their sins from their heart and ask God the Father to forgive us of our sins that He is faithful and true to forgive us of ""ALL"" our unrighteousness.

Sadly, and all too often these type films never capture or present the truth as it is written.  It would do well for them to let God's words tell the story rather than edit and try to make more ""appealing"" to the masses.  Shameful really.

 I'll give you one example.  In the Lazarus is dead scene, they have Jesus enter the Tomb and ""Blow life into him by putting his lips to his forehead.  This may not seem like a big deal but it has HUGE theological ramifications.  Jesus is God.  Read the first chapter of John.  Read first chapter of Genesis.  God spoke and the world came into existence.  Jesus authority over dead, it takes but a command, a word.  Jesus SPOKE and Lazarus came to life.  Not only that but he was bandaged up.  See John 11:43.

There are a multitude of these oversights.  I hope that people are inspired to get into his word rather than think this as an educational film and foolishly believe they have a correct understanding of Christianity, because this film and most others do not suffice.

Some people find that that the stories do not follow the Bible verbatim, but the spirit of the message is there. The thread of events leading up to Jesus and what Jesus must fulfill is there. It makes you want to read more of God's Word as a result.  As one would expect, it takes a long time to read through the 1000+ page Bible.  For a mini-series to cover it in 10 hours (4 dvd discs), you are going to lose a few things and some interpretation will need to take place to fill the gaps in a media format such as TV.

5454988,2,B00AMR5FGA,"It's okay for a very watered down telling of the Bible. From reading other posts, apparently when you buy the DVD or the Blu-ray you get an even more watered down version than what was shown on TV; what a disappointment to have learned that part. Why should the DVD or the Blu-ray versions be cut down when we actually paid for what is advertised as the ""Full 10 episodes"" that were shown on the History Channel? I'm very disappointed with both a production that left so much out that is important to telling of the Bible and then further disappointed when I was promised one thing and got another. Not a very Christian thing to do afterall. You can't tell the story about Moses and then leave out the most important parts, or leave out the telling of Solomon completely when he played a huge role in completing God's Temple and future events of the Bible and even how it affects us today. The acting and cinematography is wonderful, but the Bible message is so much more important in the big picture. All of the Bible is important and shouldn't have been glossed over so much. I realize that it would have taken so much more than the 10 hours that went into this production, and I'm not exactly sure how much of those 10 hours we actually got on this DVD, but truthfully, telling a half story, especially to those looking to learn from the Bible who have not read it will be sorely lacking in what the Bible message actually is, based on this version of the telling.

Go to YouTube and watch for free complete and accurate stories that will educate you on what the Bible actually says of these events. You won't be disappointed. They are not only complete but are just as well done if not better than what if offered here.

Although some scenes that were in the broadcast version are not included in the Blu-ray and DVD version, it is still worth the buy (but seriously, what ""artistic reason"" would somebody have for altering the series from the way it was presented on television?)

5455103,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I have read a few that are having a problem with us Bible Thumpers.  (Sorry that just reminds me of a picture of a rabbit holding a Bible).  The idea of a Scriptural error filled movie making people more hungry for God, is only making them more hungry for a false God the movie portrays.  How can one know the Biblical God?  By Reading the Word of God.  I Love God's Word, and when someone takes away God's Glory by changing the stories there is no way one can debate that as acceptable.  Would you like someone take your word out of context?  No, you would not.  So why debate any good reasons to accept an attack on God's Word.  Think about it, if you believe in God, you also know about Satan.  Satan loves to twist Gods word ... go ahead and read the debate between Eve and the Serpent.  The serpent/Satan uses ""Did God really Say ...???""  So if Satan twists the Word of God, do you really want to argue that this is good?

Lets look at a few of the problems: I watched about 10+ minutes of the 7+ hours, in bits a pieces but EVERY Story that I did see, was filled with Scriptural errors just to make the movie more exciting??? (In the order I can remember them).

Gen 19:1-10 Two angels are sent to rescue Lot and his family. In scripture The angels make the men blind, the movie makes them Ninja Angels. Gods angels swords can cut the world in half, if God would allow them, .... think about it which makes ""give God glory"" sense? Ninja angels that can be seen in most martial art movies, or a large group of men all becoming blind? Me, I think it would even be more funny with a bunch of men running around blind screaming, and in the next scene one guy say ""Man that is hot rain!"". (The hot rain could be added due to the next scene is Lot and family leaving the city, and the WORD of GOD does not cover what happened in the city as FIRE Rained down.

JOSH 2:1-18, 6:22-24. In Scripture Rahab a prostitute protected the Israelite spies from the King, due to she chose to. The Scarlet rope was hung on the window on the outside wall, and the spies climbed down it, and it was used to identify her, and her family. In the Movie, the Spies threaten her with a sword to her throat and threaten to kill her family if she does not hide them. The rope is hung on a post outside the door, and the Spies have to sneak out thru the city. Heb 11:31 Rahab had FAITH and Welcomed the Spies. James 2:25 Rahab is used to show FAITH. MT 1:5-6 Rahab is in the LINE OF DAVID, which of course is the Line of Christ. This movie takes a woman of faith, in the LINE OF CHRIST ... into a forced captive, and 2 godly / honorable spies of Israel into street thugs.

JN 11:1-45 Lazarus story. In the movie it shows the romans massacring a group of Israelites and then Jesus arriving at Lazarus's grave, and then going inside and kissing Lazarus's forehead, and Lazarus wakes up. This makes it look like Lazarus died at the massacre. Jesus going in the cave/grave is not seen and anything could have happened. In scripture Jesus receives a message from Lazarus's sisters that he whom Jesus loves is ill. Jesus waits long enough for Lazarus to die, so God can be Glorified. Jesus calls Lazarus out, which shows the power of the Voice of the Christ.

JN 13:21-29, Last Supper. In the Movie Jesus points out Judas as the Betrayer, and all the Apostles then knew it was Judas Iscariot. In Scripture Jesus says ""whomever I sop bread with is the betrayer, does it with Judas, and tells him to go and do what needs to be done"". NOT ONE of the apostles even think Judas was the betrayer, Judas was seen as the best of them, they all wondered if the betrayer was themselves.

JN 13:3-22 Road to Damascus. In the Movie, Saul of Tarsus is riding, and sees Jesus and charges him on his horse, but the horse rears, and Saul falls to the ground, and Jesus comes up and talks with him. Saul is then taken to a house in Damascus where he is still angry at Jesus. First, Saul had never met Jesus, and they did not have pictures so how did Saul recognize Jesus in the distance? Second, seeing Jesus alive even if Saul could have recognize him would have confused him, not make him angry but confused. In Scripture Saul is blinded by a Light, and hears a voice (NEVER sees Jesus), and Saul knows the light which has blinded him, and the voice is not from a helicopter above him ... say ""Who are you LORD?"". Saul knows these are not special effects, but GOD speaking to him.

The show starts with a statement of trying to keep with the Spirit of the Book. It is easily seen they do NOT understand the ""Spirit"" is the HOLY SPIRIT, and JESUS, they do not FEAR GOD! I Pet 2:17, true believers FEAR GOD, REV 14:6-7 the First Angel of tribulation years will claim ""FEAR GOD!""

You got to be kidding. There are so many blasphemies in this series; why recommend it? If one changes scripture they change Gods WORD!!! That is blasphemy! Now do right with GOD and tell the truth and warn people to stay away from this show! Go ahead and read the Bible that covers each story and see how they degrade Gods Word! Sadly, most people only know God's word via watching movies about the Bible. They do not read it. This is why so many people have problems with the Bible is because of scriptural error movies like this.

The Bible is Called the WORD of GOD. Not ""Words"" of God. It is all one word of God. Just like we teach children how to understand long words (The longest word ever is just shy of 190,000 letters, and the longest English word is 45 letters ... google it). We teach the child by breaking the word down into sections. God slowly gave us His word in small sections to help us understand it. Rev 22:18-19 Jesus ends with saying if we change what is said in the Bible, we will be punished. Jesus can only make this statement in the end of the Word. John Chapter One tells us Jesus is the WORD of God. So when we change what scripture says, we are changing how Jesus wants people to hear HIS WORD.

I have no problem with adding stuff that is not covered, but changing what is covered in the Word is clearly not acceptable to CHRIST. The only good this movie series I can recommend to get it, is to have your group read the scripture each story covers, then watch it, and it would be good training to see errors, and show they know the scripture. It would build some confidence. Think about the Treasury Dept Agents, they study real money, to be able to identify counterfeit money. Believers need to study scripture, so when false teachings like this series comes up, they will be able to tell it is wrong, and against scripture. Anyone who recommends this movie series, really does not know, or LOVES the Word of God.",1383264000,43,6677,4.261660079051383
5455104,5,B00AMR5FGA,"We purchased this miniseries to give us a broad introduction to the 3000-year biblical history leading up to the Bible.  It's extremely well done and covered nearly everything that we saw on our 3-week trip to Israel and Jordon...just got back last night.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very graphic and beautifully executed video.  We watched the ""Ben Hur"" movie on the plane yesterday coming home...This video is similar in the graphic imagery with battles of thousands and a well executed story line that covers the key points of the 3000+ years leading up to Jesus and bible and the key biblical-history locations in present-day Israel that one is likely to visit.",1383177600,,684,4.879310344827586

5455107,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I first rated this movie 3 stars because it made me think though it was inaccurate, but then I realized that some people might accept Christ if they see this movie, so I changed it to 5 stars. It is painfully inaccurate in so many ways BUT THE GOSPEL MESSAGE IS HERE, so I have to recommend it to those who always wondered what the Bible is about but were never diligent enough to READ it and find out for themselves. Maybe this movie will whet someone's appetite to find out what the Bible really says. Some people don't like to read and like movies...well if it's gonna draw anyone to God and the real Bible, I am gonna give it 5 stars for the sake of that alone. I think those of you who are rating this movie 1 star are not helping the kingdom of God. Just think how many people who already reject to read the Bible will refuse to watch it when they read your reviews. As Paul said some preach gospel this way and some that way (I am paraphrasing) but nevertheless the gospel is preached. For those of you who do read the BIBLE, consider the following as how it can profit you too. When I first started watching this I was so appalled at the Biblical inaccuracy of this movie, I really did not want to continue. Then I tried to watch it again just to test myself as how inaccurate it really is. I gave myself an assignment to compare the movie to the Bible and list all the inaccuracies and I realized that I too need to read more carefully as I was not quite sure about some things. Also in the process of watching, I was so taken with the overall message that I started crying. You will be crying for sure--I promise you. Saying not to add or take from the Bible--I get that...but it's not right.... THIS IS NOT THE HOLY BIBLE this is a movie humans made. Really sometimes I think people who made this movie did not even read the Bible. They should be required to read it at least twice before they start adding too much of unnecessary human imagination that spoiled it for so many people who do read the Bible. But it will make you think Christians, and it will test your Bible knowledge and it will help the kingdom of God if people hear the gospel.",1382918400,14,2157,4.21256038647343

5455178,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I'm a Christian. I go to church every Sunday with my family. I bought this DVD for my teenage kids so we could watch it together. I hoped it would generate some interest in the stories and history of the bible. Most importantly, I hoped it would bring-to-life the characters of the bible. The key requirement then is to have good acting, realistic stage designs, believable script.  If the director wants people to sit there and watch the show, it has to be interesting and well made.

The acting in this series is so contrived and phony that I couldn't bear watching it. Every line is announced as if they were the most important words ever spoken. Yes, I know, its the Bible. But its also about re-living the events of the bible. I don't think Abraham walked around announcing his presence every morning. Maybe the directors decided that faith alone is enough instead of talent? And why do the actors speak with forced English accents?! Is Fox a UK production company? Not only is the acting horrible, the script was written by a 5 year old. And don't get me started on the stage design. The camels have perfect white fur, everyone is wearing perfectly matching clothes in the middle of the desert. It looks like a Downy fabric softener commercial.

Honestly, the people who give this DVD series 5 stars would probably give any product 5 stars as long as it had the word ""Bible"" printed on it. I think the directors and Fox 21st Century are laughing all the way to the bank. They assumed that they could slap together some cheap computer graphics with some slick marketing and Christians would be blinded by their faith into loving this DVD series.",1381708800,7,1650,4.605442176870748

5455180,4,B00AMR5FGA,"When one makes a movie about Faith one is always in trouble :)

When one makes a movie about The Bible one gets into heavy trouble.

When one makes a movie about The Word of God one better study the word first.

The best good thing about this series is that it doesn't preach Politically Correctness to the degree one shuts off one's TV and scream loud. But one does snicker amongst oneself just a tad ;)

However, there is one fictional portrayal of ""what took place during the trials of Jesus"" that I found very believable; and it also brings some sense to our question: why would the same people who celebrated Christ on Palm Sunday so completely have a turn-around and toss Him to the wolves, just a few days later, in the early morning hours of Long Friday? The producers of The Bible play it this way: before Pontius Pilatus presents Barabbas versus Jesus, the Temple guards ""gallantly prevent"" supporters of Christ from entering Pilate's court yard... so only a few followers get in to vote for their precious candidate. Thus, Barabbas gets a majority vote and is freed. It is amazing how this  portrayal of ""balance manipulation"" parallels with how certain political events/candidates/polls of today are ""managed"" and ""voted"" and later ""reported"" on.

Always have your Bible close at hand when watching this series.",1381622400,,1323,4.780701754385965

5455204,3,B00AMR5FGA,"I know the actual Bible is epic in length and has so many stories to tell, but I feel there is so much lacking here. It's also something I thought I'd be able to watch with older kids, but a lot of the violence is extra graphic, actual decapitations, head as a trophy. It's a very 'Hollywood' version of events which is sad, they've sexed up the male/female relationships in a cheesy way and have hit the violence pretty hard. On the whole, it's not a bad effort but there is a lot that needs to be discounted when it comes to actually sticking to biblical truth, and when it comes to switching things up for ratings. They have used a lot of poetic license and I would hate for people who aren't aware of the actual bible to think that what they are seeing is a genuine representation of the actual bible.",1381276800,3,805,4.26797385620915

Because this was 20th Century Fox, I was skeptical when I spied this at my local library, but decided to take a chance on it.  I did not know at the time who was behind the production, or perhaps I might have had higher hopes.  Anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to saved Christians and seekers alike. There are times when they get it just right in their spiritual interpretation of the Bible stories, and there is not the overdone, schmaltzy sense of loftiness that so many Bible movies of the past have, which ultimately detracts from the Bible's true meaning and spirit!  It may be my favorite of all Bible productions for this reason alone. I do struggle with some of the B-Grade acting, particularly in the Old Testament episodes, but this is still a must-see.

The intensity of this production put me right back in time, it was so realistic and did not have the 'Hollywood' glam about it... it was real events, real people just like they would have been over 2-3000 years ago... I loved it.  I highly recommend this particular version of The Bible: The Epic Miniseries.",1379980800,,616,4.811320754716981
5455294,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Never have I seen a show that has touched me so deeply as this epic mini-series. I'm all for it when 'The Bible' reaches new listeners, picks up those that have fallen, those who are lost or refreshes their faith when it has gone stale.

I was struggling this past year with many things. I am a person of faith but felt that even I had lost some of the fire in my soul.  I was having trouble finding it again. I had faith. I just felt it was becoming 'stale'.

Then, I watched 'The Bible' when it first came out on the History Channel.  I loved every minute of the stories from 'Genesis' to the book of 'Revelation'.  I felt some of that fire returning. Diogo Morgado lit up the screen with his portrayal of Jesus Christ. I saw such passion on his face and love in his eyes every second he was on screen. But, what lifted my spirits and renewed every ounce of faith I had in me was when I saw the interview of Diogo on Youtube.  With so much warmth and conviction, he teared up as he talked about how he was haunted by the Crucifixion scene.  I know Diogo is a very talented actor but he seemed completely genuine and humbled by going through this experience. He did shine when he talked about his role. It was evident on his face.

But, can we please drop the #HotJesus now?(I never jumped on that bandwagon). It feels sacrilegious to me.  He gets asked about that hashtag in every interview and I know he's being nice but I can tell it makes him a little uncomfortable. I like #SexyDiogo, however. I like #LovingJesus or #MercifulJesus. But not #HotJesus.  This beautiful story isn't about how sexy people think Jesus(Morgado) is but what He came here to do for us.  Matthew 26:28: ""For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remissions of sins."" That's the message this whole series is trying to convey.  Jesus gives his heart freely and loves unconditionally. He sacrificed so that we may live.

Darwin Shawn, as the disciple, Peter, did a fantastic job embracing the role of Jesus' favorite follower. He truly let the Lord work through him and was so convincing in his role that I wanted to be there in that moment with him;  with them all.  Roma Downey was excellent as Mary. To watch her help her son pick up his cross, knowing what was in store for him was heart breaking. We get to see suffering on different levels and in various ways. We suffer through the eyes of another--'suffering by proxy'.

Since I've already watched it on t.v., I'm leaving a review now. Though, I will be getting the DVD for my birthday next month! :)

Diogo Morgado said he would be happy if this series even touched one soul. No, you have touched millions with your gifts. Never let them die or become corrupted by the monsters of the industry. Your role has renewed my spirit. He was perfect for this role as Jesus Christ. He seems down to earth and humble. He wanted to play the Jesus he knew. In Matthew 11:29---""Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto you souls."" No one could portray Jesus so humbly as Diogo has so beautifully done. Who better to play the part than one who is kind, warm and also humble? Example: When asked if he was 'famous' in Portugal, he said, ""I'm known there."" A perfect answer. He didn't say 'I'm a famous actor/model'. It does one no good to think too highly of him/herself. It's better to let others praise your work than to praise yourself.

I highly recommend this series to any and all who are looking for more; for those who are tired of what they are watching on t.v. and in movies; for those who have seen enough violence and depravity to last two lifetimes; for those seeking the positive to overshadow all the negative we endure in this world.

Diogo didn't have say a word or even move.  I've never seen an actor convey everything they had in them as Diogo did portraying Jesus.  I knew exactly what he was 'saying' just by looking in his eyes. Diogo is extremely blessed and gifted when all he needs to do is show his eyes and you just know. The eyes are the windows to the soul. It seems Diogo really is a sweet person if the saying is true.

Watch my video that is dedicated to this series. [...]

ETA: I couldn't wait for my birthday so I went ahead and ordered it express. I didn't want to wait an extra 8 days. I know, patience is a virtue. ;)

5455295,2,B00AMR5FGA,"This miniseries basically dilutes, omits and replaces large chunks of the source material; and in place of that it shoehorns in utterly ridiculous, B-movie level melodrama.

I stopped watching when I literally couldn't stop laughing:
During the story of Sodom's destruction... The cliched Asian angel pulls out two swords and proceeds to launch into the obligatory hollywood spinning around - deftly killing everyone - street fight scene.
(for those that aren't aware: there's no such silliness in the Biblical account)

That's was just the last absurd straw for me.

I've no issues with violence.
The Bible is in fact an extremely violent book; and I wish more interpretations included the violence; but it's all about context, and tone.
This was ""wow, cool!"" violence; that might impress a 12 year-old.

There are many (frankly too numerous to list here) far more interesting and relevant parts of Genesis that it entirely omits in lieu of said silliness.

5455375,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Very entertaining and very accurate considering they condensed thousands of years of human history into 10 hours.
It was awesome to see Genesis play out in Hi-Def with big production effects. The most powerful depiction of Jesus's birth I have ever seen! I well up with tears everytime I watch it. If you haven't seen this series its excellent and it will make you open your Bible.
The only word of caution would be that this movie makes you realize how brutal the times were. Its one thing to read it in scripture but, to see it carried out is something else entirely. Even with much of the violence and bloodshed ""toned down"" to make it a family movie, I'd pre-screen it before I let children younger than 10 watch it. No sexual content but it gets bloody at times. (Cain kills Abel with a rock..and you see it, eye goudging, stonings ,beheadings lots of blood and so-on)
Its not over the top but it really makes you realize how violent mankind has always been. I highly reccommend it blood violence and all. Its very powerful and very well done.

5455476,3,B00AMR5FGA,"The series is awesome and just amazing in movie magic and show piece. But do not take it as word for word straight from the Bible. There are many things they leave out from the Bible. I will try to name a couple off the top of my head. In the King David episode, the Prophet who confronts King David about having an affair with Bathsheba and having her husband killed, in the Bible he immediately repents and asks God for forgiveness, in the series he does no such thing.  I gave it 3 stars for presentation and keeping viewers riveted. But in many other parts it is not Biblical. Samson and Delilah episode is another example. It is still wonderful to have this series but know it is loosely based on the Bible and not a replacement for it.",1378166400,3,741,4.292857142857143

It was very well made and we hope that other producers will follow in producing films that will enrich peoples lives instead of all that trash, sex, drugs, violence, depravation, despair, etc.  Hollywood has taken the wrong direction, but its films line The Bible that give us hope that there are still some producers that value enriching other peoples lives and not just focusing on the money with no regard as to what negative consequences and influences their films bring to society and our youth.

5455529,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I bought this series for my mother-in-law and later purchased this series for myself through iTunes. Overall this is a solid 4 out of 5 stat production. The series would have been a solid 5 stars if not for the ninja angels, the black Samson, the Virgin Mary having birthing pain at the birth of Jesus, and the female apostle of Jesus Christ. Still, even with these blatant mistakes, it does do one thing extremely correct in properly depicting the various ""theophanies"" of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament (I.e. Jesus in the blazing furnace with the three youths in the book of Daniel). So overall very good, and mostly accurate. It's a great way to slowly introduce your children to the Bible and to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.",1377907200,,736,4.625954198473282

5455531,4,B00AMR5FGA,"My husband is a Catholic chaplain and a student of the Bible. I was raised by a Baptist Minister and attend a nondenominational evangelical church. I read about this series in Guideposts.

I purchased it thinking it would be neat to see what they did with it, and in hopes that maybe our kids would enjoy it when they're a little older (right now they are ten and under). Overall, my husband felt they did a good job of touching on the high points in scripture. They took some liberties, of course, and I would have liked to see less of the cast be white. It's also pretty violent. But if you're curious about the Bible, it could serve as a decent introduction. If you are a believer, it's not a bad way to spend your time if you don't mind a fair amount of throat slitting. Sometimes it seemed like they skipped parts of the story that were important [to Christians] in order to tell the story they were telling, but I kind of expected that since the Book is always better than the movie.",1377907200,,989,4.317204301075269
5455532,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Taking on the whole Bible is certainly a challenge - and so this hits some highlights (haven't finished the whole series yet).  Thought they did a great job especially on Abraham's life.  I still like THE BIBLE best, an old but well produced, long film by John Huston.  As to the Gospel story, I like The Gospel According to John the best.

5455586,4,B00AMR5FGA,"A well-made series, albeit i wish it would have lasted longer and expanded more.  Too bad there is no version of this mini series that includes an extended cut, or at the very least, a Deleted Scenes section under special features that would include those cuts seen/not seen on TV.

It is so moving and just makes you feel like you were there as the Bible was being written. It has been done so incredibly well and I am so happy to have bought the whole series on blu-ray so I can watch it over and over again. It tells the biblical stories very well and Roma and her husband picked amazing actors to play the parts. I have almost felt as though the actors are the real people who were alive and written about in the Bible. Amazing show and I would recommend it to anyone! Definitely shows the power of God and what He has been doing over this long span of time! He's still reigning on high too!,1377820800,,715,4.188405797101449

5455593,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I loved watching every part of the entire series.  As a born again Christian who strives to live uprightly, it impacted me tremendously especially in the light of God through His Son Jesus Christ dying a sacrificial death so that all of mankind can know forgiveness of sin and a hope of spending eternity in Heaven.  Christ's example of showing love, mercy and forgiveness to anyone who has wronged Him,  is the highest form of love and forgiveness.  Forgiving the perpetrator is a very powerful thing and sets the person apart to the highest degree.  I highly recommend this epic story to everyone who wonders how people in Biblical times coped with life.  The reality is that down through the ages mankind has always faced struggles, hardships and adversity and for anyone looking for hope and a future, it is really only to be found in the Bible and accepting God's free offer of Salvation.  The characters in the series was portrayed very powerfully and profoundly and anything that is worth dying for will come at great cost, but the rewards are priceless.",1377561600,2,1061,4.7650273224043715

The special effects are spectacular, the actors are great and the audio is stunning.  I loved every minute of it, but after I watched the whole thing I had to sit down and write this.  I really really wish they really had kept the story strictly accurate to what the Bible says.  Before every episode they say that ""it endeavors to stay true to the spirit of the book"" but they could have tried harder.  There are a LOT of things that irritated me a bit because when you read them in the Bible, you can read it is completely different to what you see in the film.  That was a real let down.  Also, the last episode left me wanting more.  I wanted to see more about the apostles and about the book of revelation.  So if you really want to know the true story of the Bible, read it.

5455723,3,B00AMR5FGA,"I enjoyed watching the show but not to the extent I was expecting given all the publicity.  I was somewhat disappointed with some of the acting which was, in my view, not realistic and came across as patently false creating a loss of credibility.  Also I found the pearly white teeth of some of the actors to be very distracting, and most unlikely for the times.  There were many important events in the Bible that I would have expected to be included but weren't, and many of the included scenes were overly embellished.  No doubt many people will disagree with my take on all this.",1376784000,2,583,4.523809523809524

5455752,4,B00AMR5FGA,"This was a great presentation of the Bible! They did a good job selecting a great story line to tie everything together. The special effects were excellent. I was hoping that the cast would be middle eastern. It just seems hard to believe the story when Noah is Irish, Samson is African American, Mary is British,  and Thomas is Scottish. Jesus was impressive though.",1376438400,,367,4.734375

This series just adds flesh to the stories in my head, adds smells, textures and emotions that I wouldn't have perhaps imagined.

5455759,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Not having cable, I had to wait for the DVD to become available at my local library. In the meantime I saw lots of friends and reviewers raving about how fantastic this was. Let's just say I had high expectations. By the second episode I knew those expectations weren't going to be met. Not even a little bit.

It's obviously unrealistic to expect the entire Bible to be portrayed in a few episodes and of course one can condense or leave out entirely certain stories and details without losing the intent of The Bible itself. There didn't seem to be an interest in the intent of The Bible here, however. It's as if the screenwriters just put together a few stories they thought they could dramatize and wanted to include some of the most popular verses, without regard to accuracy or the heart of the story. And what's with the sword play every ten minutes? Yes, really, about every ten minutes someone was being beheaded, slashed, or beat to a pulp. Yes, there is a lot of violence in the Old Testament and in the culture of the times, however the violence included here was gratuitous and mostly pointless with lots of slow-mo, close-ups, and spurting blood. It's like Quentin Tarantino directed this.

Half of the series is completely fabricated (dialogue and scenes not in The Bible - beyond simply trying to create a bridge between stories) and the other half has altered The Bible so much I can't even recommend it to someone who wants to know more about it but isn't compelled to read it for themselves. Verses and stories are taken out of context. It fails to connect the New Testament to the Old. More importantly, it gives little sense of the nature of God. If one was totally unfamiliar with the Bible, this series would simply appear to be a hodge-podge of violence, weird storylines, and ancient hippies. It's a farce and in some instances one might think they are watching a spoof of a Bible movie.

Even though I knew early on that I wasn't a fan of this miniseries, I wanted to watch it all the way through. I became even more frustrated with the series as it progressed. I was relieved when it was over although it did provide plenty of comedy material.",1376179200,11,2171,4.561538461538461

5455771,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Had to pick ""hate it"" in order to write a review. Actually, I love this series. I'm an Aussie and it is currently being televised here. However, when I purchased this product from Amazon I had to return it for a refund because it would not play on my DVD player. I was not a happy chappie because it did not state that this may be the case in your advertisement. It was a lot of hassle.",1376179200,,386,4.025974025974026

5455773,4,B00AMR5FGA,I bought this because it brought so many people to the Biblical stories of the ancient texts. The Blu-ray is stunning quality and make the series well worth watching. my critic is that it is not accurately interpreted as it really happened in the Bible and therefore somewhat deceptive. After Jesus comes on the scene it gets a little better then the beginning. I would recommend anyone serious about Christianity to read the stories in the Bible to see the inaccuracies to see the wrongs in the interpretations that Christians hold so dear to their hearts. Still if you overlook all that its a good watch.,1376092800,,606,4.726415094339623
5455774,5,B00AMR5FGA,Awesome.  It was all excellent.  The actors (except Rome Downey) were wonderful.  If Roma wanted to see how Mary should have acted she needed to see Jesus of Nazareth with Olivia Hussey - now that was a Mary and Pieta ! !,1376006400,,221,4.214285714285714
5455775,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I admit when this program first aired on TV I was skeptical as to how well I would like it. Now I'm glad to say that I not only enjoyed the series but I also bought the DVD set. So your probably wondering why I only gave it 4 stars.  Some of the scenes are not exactly as they occured in the book. To the best of my knowledge, and I admit I am not a bible scholar, there is no evidence of any baptism other than full immersion which the Greek work baptizo means. There are other variances, such as how the Spirit of God descended as a dove upon Jesus after he was baptized and God spoke from the heavens which was completely omitted in the series.  All that being said, I just want to say this is an excellent series and well worth the purchase price.",1376006400,,751,4.033557046979865

5455778,3,B00AMR5FGA,"This miniseries tries to tackle quite a lot of the Bible in less than 4 discs, and in doing so it omits some truly great stories(such as Joseph)and spends a bit too long on some that could have been omitted(such as Samson). There were times the series dragged on slowly and got a bit boring, but the ending was very well done.",1376006400,,326,4.274193548387097

If you get a chance to travel to the US , apparently now one can get it from other retailers like Best Buy or Target.
This is the best production i have ever seen on the life of Jesus and the acting is second to none. The main actor that plays Jesus is a relatively unknown Portuguese actor but what a GREAT actor that incarnates the full spirit of Jesus ...simply SUPERB!!!

Most stories about Jesus ends with his death and resurrection.  This movie goes on to tell about how the apostles carried on the works of Christ and how they lived out their lives.

5455831,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Yes! It is inaccurate like many people states.

If this bible series is made for ministry and hope more people knowing God and believe in God, I don't think it is going to work.  I think non-believers will run away from God, new-believers will be very confused and maybe also run away from God, the stronger-believers will be mad to this show because they know it is not what bible said.

If you are watching it as a fantasy and pleasure, it is not that great as well.  The story cut very short, lack of explanation, and choose and pick the wrong moment to put together. Also, the acting and character choosing are pretty bad as well. Abraham is the father of faith, but he acts like he is hopeless, uncertain, and weak.  Moses is a a great leader in the real bible, but the the drama Moses act like a sorcerer, beggar, with evil eyes.  The Moses in the show doesn't act that he believe in God, he is more like avenger.  When he ask his people to put staff in the water to make the river become blood, his action was so funny, and his eyes was so evil.

This show will confuse people, and make them think it is ok to adultery.  It didn't say how much great things King David has done, but he made a terrible mistake.  Instead the TV show focus on his adultery sin, and said it is ok because he is God's favorite.  This is a really bad influence, people will then have excuse for sins.

Samson ...... I don't know what to say.

The real bible said when Daniel's friend got throw into the fire, they stand strong. In the show, they were so afraid.  The real bible said the Daniel got put in with lion, he was strong and have faith.  In the show, he was so afraid.

Oh, by the way... The bible said Sarah (Abraham's wife) was very very pretty that other kings want to kill Abraham for his wife... but in TV show... I don't think any man would want to kill Abraham to be with Sarah.  I think the actress who act Mary should be Sarah, she is much prettier and would make more sense to real bible. Yeah, this sounds like a joke, but it is some thing the team need to be consider if they really want to make this show be loyal to the bible.

Anyway... very fancy show, but very disappointed in many ways.",1374624000,8,2197,4.165876777251185

There was SO much important stuff left out and what was shown had many serious Biblical errors that I noticed right and left; that affects the overall outcome of the stories told? What I don't get is why the producers, while busy show boating with their celebrity friends, didn't bother to crack open a real Bible, while writing the acting scripts? They even went on to say that they had help from top Biblical scholars to help give them advice on accuracy. Really...? Then why did they use a lamb caught in the brush rather than a Ram during Abraham's Sacrificial journey with Isaac, what is with the Angels doing Kung Fu and sword fighting at Sodom, why was SO much left out with Moses at the Burning Bush, where was the pillar of fire to block Pharaoh's Army, and so on? Even the first miracle before Pharaoh with the serpent got so screwed up to the point that they didn't even perform the miracle? Moses and  Pharaoh were never childhood rivals (that is based on Cecil De Mill's version)? As a matter of fact, when Moses came back to Egypt 40 years later, nobody knew of him, otherwise the Egyptians would have executed him on the spot for killing of the overseer? In the New Testament, when Jesus fed the multitudes bread and fish, the scriptures don't mention that it nearly became a mob scene where people started hailing Jesus as the Messiah to the point that Jesus had to depart from them? No, the scriptures say that they were all fed and peaceful. Then the disciples gathered up the remaining food and left for the sea.

I could go on and on, but I think you get the point here. I think, though well intentioned to do a good job, the producers either ignored advice or didn't get good advice at all? Either way, I do not recommend this series to anyone who wants to see the Bible Stories played out accurately. They should have put a notice for the viewers to see saying, ""Stories told here are based on real events, but not necessarily accurate for the sake of time and ratings! Check your Bible for Accuracy and proper content according to the scriptures before viewing!!""",1374364800,3,2213,4.488833746898263

The episodes bounced from one bloody moment in
the Bible to the next. It is obvious that they
attempted to make a Hollywood blockbuster as
filled with violence as possible. The scenes
bounced around like ping pong balls. It was
like a really long movie trailer,
fast forwarding through hundreds of years of
Jewish history. Even the background music was
overly dramatic, and annoying.

5455847,3,B00AMR5FGA,"Thus far, I have only watched one episode of this exciting miniseries.  Yet, it strikes me that this series would NOT be well suited to someone who does not already have a good command of Scripture.  For example, Genesis' themes of Creation/the Fall and the Promise of Redemption receive minimal attention.  Also, an incredible amount of material is not even glossed over.  After the first hour, the ""coming attractions"" indicate that this miniseries will be ""fast forwarding"" all the way to Moses!

It is certainly true that all films based on the Bible have shortcomings and seem to use a good deal of poetic license.  Still, I would like to suggest an alternative viewing list....

  Esther: This film struck me as superior to the better known ""One Night with the King,"" which also tells of how Esther was chosen queen and used her position to rescue her people. This film seems to avoid misleading poetic license excesses (cf, my Amazon review.).

  The Old Testament (1963): Since the focus of this film is Maccabees, the name ""Old Testament"" is confusing.

  Peter & Paul: This film struck me as superior to that better known film about the early Church, ""A.D.""  Yet it is so HIGHLY INADEQUATE in its treatment of Peter, that it would be better packaged as ""peter and !!!PAUL!!!."" Saint Peter, to whom Christ gave the keys of the Kingdom, is treated as as afterthought!  (cf, my Amazon review.).

First I have to say that I did not even bother watching the entire set due to my disappointment in the ones that I did watch. I really hate when the Bible is changed up in key areas. I know there is going to be some filler when it is acted out, but the filler in this series is pure gunk. They could have done way better than constant sword slashing scenes, blah. Also, I was not impressed with any of the special effects, the scenery or with any of the actors in the movie. There is no redemptive feature about it. I was so eager to get these and I was really excited about seeing them because of all the hoop la I had read and heard. Instead I could not bring myself to watch even half of it. If anyone is interested I will be happy to sell them ""like new"" for a good deal. I suppose those who have not read the Bible may not be so disappointed. Sadly some of them are supposed to be followers of Jesus Christ. Just know it is not to be taken as the truth because it has too many untruths or partial truths, which isn't the truth at all.

I am so pleased that it is now coming on to commercial TV here in Australia starting tomorrow night on one of our main TV channels - Channel 9, but a part of me wonders how long it will last on commercial TV as it may prove to be ""offensive"" to some. If this happens and it is taken off air, it will make me very ashamed.

Congratulations to Roma Downey and her husband Mark Burnett for the production of this excellent epic series.

People can get a little nit-picky about what is right and what is wrong but overall it is correct. If they were to include absolutely everything, it would be far too long and no doubt people would become bored. I feel this was long enough to keep people's interest up and learn.

I'm not overly a religious person but I think everybody should watch this series. As my sister often says, ""We are fast becoming a GODless society"".

It truly is the greatest story ever told.",1373846400,,1082,4.28921568627451

5455869,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Absolutely worthless. This is a heretical corruption of the Bible. The worst false teachers around came together to make this garbage, and it shows their misunderstanding of the Gospel.

Christ died to pay for the sins of the world, not to give man a purpose or other such nonsense. Christ's command to all people is to repent of sin and trust in Him alone.",1373760000,3,357,4.578125

Also, they made Abraham's character a bit different than what the Bible says.  Isaac was too young.  I think the film maker needs to study the Bible more.",1373328000,,312,4.15

Actors and acting are excellent, as are the cinematography and music.  I will say that some key sections of the books--such as the creation of the world and all its inhabitants and the fall of Adam and Eve as depicted in Genesis--are glossed over, though.",1373241600,,409,4.898550724637682

5455900,3,B00AMR5FGA,"How does one do this without seeming blasphemous, heretical, and blah. Well, it is unremittingly grim, as I am certain life was back that many millenia ago, It was purchased as a present for my wife, but I watched most of it first-run on the box. It is, after all, a teleplay, and the keen problem therein is; how can that epic an history be reduced, meaningfully, to a few hours? The answer is. it can't be. So it is a sort of Cliff's Notes about Judaism and it's very long history.
Understand, I have had a few brushes with organized religion in the past with all involved parties removed from the field bruised but wiser for the failure. What I do know in good conscience is that the Bible is mostly law, and a life blueprint, as is its New Testament addendum. And it is strong law. Nowhere in these films did I seem to see that touched upon as the sole worthwhile counterpoint to what is endlessly inventive and general human iniquity. We live by it every day, and that is the Bible's key inheritance: law.
So, I'd rate this Epic Miniseries as a fair tutorial. For believers, not thinkers. Those for whom the oozy plastic grays, the yins and yangs of good and evil are not daily concerns. Which is good, in a way.",1373068800,,1217,4.365638766519824
5455901,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Please, be familiar with God's Word, the Bible. Read it carefully before watching this movie. I think Paul's letter to Timothy describes it very well.  In 2 Timothy 4:3-4, Paul writes, ""For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.""
This movie misses key elements of why God does things. He works out of love.",1373068800,,521,4.663043478260869
5455902,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I watched all the episodes on TV, and decided I wanted to watch them again someday. When it came out on DVD I didn't even doubt it. This production was very well done, I am a catholic and It was very meaningful to watch. I think they did a very good job on the stories. I understand it is hard to stick to the Bible word by word, and probably nobody will ever do that with accurate precision, but this series was based on history and the environment of each story on the Bible.
 I admire this series, and their creators. Despite all criticism that it shows violence and blood, the main stories and the point for us as viewers is to get the feeling of what was going on in those days, and about the power of the love of God... when we have been able to only read all about it on our Holy Bible, now, we ""get the picture""... At least I did.
I really liked it!",1373068800,2,857,4.041176470588235

unless religious people who might breathe a sigh of relief when it's over.  My husband really liked it.  If a person likes nail biting scenes, doesn't mind suffering, featuring the crucifix, buy a video.  This is a true story not to be taken lightly.  Millions of people raved about The Bible.  Many a person was greatly moved by it.  I would not hesitate to anyone to purchase this video.",1372982400,2,512,4.5
5455908,1,B00AMR5FGA,"A simple reading of the Bible would show that just the first disk of The Bible series is a politically correct and unfaithful interpretation of the Bible.  The most blatant being the forced implied sin of Sodom and Gomorrah as being that of female prostitution and erasing any mention or hint of God's judgment of the sin of men with men.  There are many other incorrect presentations, but it would take too long to list them here.  One should see a section of the series and then read the corresponding biblical portion to see how much unlike the actual Bible is presented.",1372982400,3,574,4.607843137254902

If you know your bible you will see the errors in this miniseries. I suggest that if one watches this miniseries that they also compare it to the bible as one shoould do anyway. For we are to compare all thing with the bible even when the word is being preached to you so that you know it is the true word of God. To me the miove was alright I wish the would depict Jesus as he really is the bible does discribe a little of what Jesus looked like, He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him.

I think the decisions were well-considered.  It is clear that this series was produced by true believers in the sacred content of the Bible.  Very good acting, well produced with effective music.  All in all a great buy!  I watched the series as it was presented on the History Channel, but couldn't wait to buy the dvd so I could see it all again.

This movie is a very inaccurate depiction of the Bible, and it was done in poor taste. The battle scenes were extremely graphic and probably should have pulled an R rating for that alone. The stories were incomplete and important facts were missing. I did not watch the series when it aired and opted to purchase the dvd instead. I have beent old that are parts missing from the dvd that did air on the series. Maybe that explains why this is so horrible. I will never buy another mini series like this again. I did purchase the movie the Gospel of John and my family has watched that and enjoyed it very much. I was soerly disappointed with this mini series and would not reccommend it to anyone looking to honor God. THis isn't honori9ng God at all. It is a bloody hollywood disaster and should not be sold in any Christian book stores. I would have rated this a zero if I had been allowed to do so.",1372723200,,1027,4.271794871794872

Great looking miniseries is unfortunately under served by a sense of ""hurried-ness"" as though the filmmakers can't wait to get to the next segment. An all too ambitious project that attempted to go through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation in ten episodes.

5455961,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Especially Good Material for the non-Christian to view as an Entertaining Big Budget Movie... (Makes them ask questions that opens a very good door towards understanding God!)

 I hope (that being said) that there are more films like this produced for non-believers (without an in depth knowledge of Christian History) to enjoy; ""but next time I sincerely pray that they don't edit the DVD movie back from the Original TV Broadcasted Version, like they did with this one!""

 If you had not seen this on TV, during the original broadcasting, you would just think that the timeline and flow through History was a little bit choppy and somewhat vague in parts, but in fact this DVD version has scenes deleted from the ""much clearer to understand Broadcasted version"":-(

 Why edit & delete scenes in the DVD version (made from the original Broadcasted version), I'll never understand???

 (This seems to be an especially foolish choice for the producers in these days when Extra Scene, Extended & Director's Cut DVD's are so popular!)

 Never the less, If you did not see this Broadcasted or wanted to use this as a tool to open wholesome conversations with those who haven't seen it, This Is An Awesome Movie Concept To Present God's History With Us :-)

However, as it progresses it is quite good and the acting throughout the whole thing is superb.

I felt it lacked a lot of the essential elements of the stories that are in the Bible.  I've read the Bible several times due to my upbringing, so I know the stories forward and back.

Pros:
Beautifully presented
Great actors that fit the roles extremely well
Gives me a deeper appreciation for the Bible and God
Reminds me that God is both a just God and a merciful God; He is Holy and Righteous and He is love!

Cons:
It's not purely accurate; there were some liberties taken
It has violent scenes and I would not recommend allowing children to watch it
I couldn't get enough; seemed to fast. It could have been 5 times longer LOL

But I feel like the good outweighs the bad. This was one popular series and I am happy about that. Let the Gospel of Jesus be proclaimed in any way possible!",1371340800,,735,4.311594202898551

5456019,1,B00AMR5FGA,"""The Bible"" could more honestly be called ""bits and pieces of the Bible."" Adam and Eve get a couple seconds, Cain and Abel half a second, Noah with the usual circus animals maybe five seconds, and we get to the first substantial segment, Abraham. After this there is no attempt even to summarize the copious missing material (e.g. Jacob and Esau, Joseph and his brothers).

There are a number of interesting rough edges smoothed over in a manner all too typical of Bible adaptations. For example, Moses follows the tradition of bravely commanding Pharaoh, ""Let my people go!"" But in the Bible, Moses rather meekly attempts to con Pharaoh with the idea that the Hebrews need to go into the desert for a three-day sacrifice ceremony. (And, oh yes, they'll need all their cattle because the Lord will pick out the sacrifice on site.) Pharaoh isn't fooled for a minute. A more important rough edge obliterated from this story is that Pharaoh decides to let the Hebrews go after each of the plagues, but the Lord hardens his heart because He is anxious to use all His plagues. (No, I'm not making this up. Read the Bible.)

The most dishonest segment shows King David celebrating the arrival of the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem while his wife Michal looks on admiringly. In the Bible, David celebrates by getting drunk and dancing naked in the streets. His wife -- the woman who saved his life, the woman who (I'm reading between the lines here), as the daughter of the former king, did much to legitimize his usurpation of the throne, is scandalized and berates David. David shows his gratitude by cursing her with barrenness.

I guess most believers are happy to get the sanitized and bowdlerized version, but someday I'd love to see a warts-and-all adaptation of the Word of God.",1371081600,3,1783,4.726688102893891
5456020,3,B00AMR5FGA,"I was so excited when I saw this come out, but I really was so disappointed by the way the Biblical figures were portrayed.  They all seemed unstable, kind of crazy.  I know there are many, many Christians who are like that, but when I read the Bible I see people I can look up to.  The folks in this movie do not give me any such confidence.  A lot of liberties were taken with the way things played out and with things that were not mentioned in the Bible at all.  I just wish they would have stuck to the Book.  If it's not in there, don't add it.  If it's in there--by all means, let's see it.  I feel like there was an amazing opportunity to display the amazing God of the Bible and the amazing faith and feats of the first people of God, and it was sensationalized and Hollywoodized away.  I guess it's up to real Christians to do that, not a movie series.",1371081600,,862,4.083333333333333

5456030,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I'm only 3 hours into this ""Epic Mini-Series"" from the folks at The History Channel and I already have so many issues I don't know where to begin. I guess the obvious place is where everyone else has already commented: the gratuitous violence and non-stop bloody gore. WTF??? I can't get my mind around how this kind of bloodfest can be touted as ""wholesome entertainment with a message."" I mean, I can just imagine the casting call notice in Variety:

Wanted:

500 dirty, oily, sweaty, muscular, long-haired males who can sneer and clank swords loudly while gnashing their teeth and screaming ""ARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH"" over and over and over at the top of their lungs in skimpy Roman costumes.

For the life of me I can not figure out what the demographic is that this series is targeting. Definitely not children, or even young adults. CERTAINLY not women, of any age. Perhaps there is a heretofore unknown sub-sect of white, male, raw-goat-eating barbarians in need of religious conversion? I'm mystified.

The whole draw for me here was Roma Downey. Yes, ""Touched By An Angel's"" Roma-God-Loves-You-Downey, perhaps the loveliest and gentlest Irish lass ever to have walked the earth. Although I haven't gotten to that part yet, I understand she plays Mary, mother of Jesus, and I can't think of a more suitable role for her. I keep telling myself as I plod through this (I can only take a few minutes at a time but I WILL get through the whole thing- I am COMMITTED) I keep telling myself that surely Roma will somehow redeem this unholy MESS called ""The Bible"" which, thus far appears to have VERY LITTLE to do with the real message of the Great Holy Book.

Another thing I take issue with is this: why is it considered so politically incorrect to expect that Middle-Easterners should be played by people who look, and sound, like Middle-Easterners? Racially and ethnically this thing is all over the map! But we know it couldn't have been that way in reality. Delilah had a British accent? Samson was a Jamaican? I can understand the concept of ""suspension of disbelief"" when I'm watching a dramatization, especially fiction or science-fiction. What I am unable to manage is the required ""suspension of intellect"" that filmmakers require of anyone unfortunate enough to try to ingest godforsaken crap like this. What's next? A biopic of Hitler portrayed by an Asian? A white woman as Muhammed Ali? A red-headed Irish boy as Confuscius? Give me a break!

I guess the lesson here is that The History Channel stopped being about History a long, long time ago. Gone are the days of wonderful, enjoyable quality educational fare with narration by the wonderful Edward Herrmann. How I miss that! No, now it's reality shows and blood-and-guts Vikings and Romans and Swamp People and heaven knows what's next! This ""Bible"" series is a perfect example of how far today's entertainment has sunk.

Something else that is troublesome for me is the narration. This story is sooooo egregiously condensed and the way that it literally zips through centuries in a matter of seconds can be dizzying. The narration is supposed to cover this but it doesn't. It breaks up the film, bringing the viewer out of the distant past and into the modern day by the usage of a too-informal, relaxed, conversational narration style rather than one that fits the film and which bespeaks HISTORICAL DOCUMENT. It also takes the story-telling into documentary format which is jarring and offputting. Those two words apply as well to the jerky, convulsive, constantly swinging camera movements, especially in the battle scenes. We never get to actually SEE what's going on, or how a character reacts to the action, for more than the fleetingest of instants. I assume this ""technique"" is intended to put me into the picture by making me seasick? Or perhaps it is intended to disguise shoddy production. Methinks the latter. I know I sound smug, and that's really not me. But I am not fooled by tricks intended to make me think some work was done where needed effort was actually WITHHELD, and that is happening continually throughout this movie. It's a shame, too, because the actual production VALUES appear to be rather high. After a while the viewer begins to feel his intelligence, and that of the audience at large, is being insulted, plain and simple.

Personally, when I think ""Bible"" I immediately think of the Love-of-God. So far that concept hasn't even been HINTED at in this series. I'm a collector of biblical movies and truly enjoy the simple yet authoritative wisdom imparted in such films and shows. I find it encouraging and healing. But so far this series has shown only the absolute WORST of humanity imaginable: man killing man, senselessly, constantly, unthinkingly and uncaringly, destroying families and innocents, plundering and raping and looting and robbing and damning and condemning and hating, hating, hating. Always furious, with bloodthirst unquenchable, that is the man we see here, in just about every scene thus far. Heaven help us if that's what we ever were! I for one simply DO NOT believe it! But we live in a day and age when even the document most sacred to a very large segment of humanity can be bastardized and trashed in the name of profit by using methods geared toward garnering ratings, ratings, ratings above all else. Above being true to the content of the source. Above the best interests and the uplifting of the audience for whom the film was supposedly made. We know who this film was made for, and it was NOT the masses. It was made for the people whose bank accounts might be enriched, period. And that's disgraceful.

Anyway, in case I haven't made it clear I am hating this series. And remaining open-minded is proving a tremendous challenge.

I may have more to say as I watch more of this unspeakable trash, I'll have to see if I can make it through to the end.

Stay tuned!

UPDATE 6-27-13:

I have now made it into hour 5 of this godforsaken MESS. Which is Part III, so I'm halfway through. I'm pretty sure the body count is now equal to that of all the Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Seagal, Stallone and Willis movies put together. When I saw the scene where two tots have their throats slit while their father, the king, is forced to watch just before his own eyes are gauged out I was deeply, deeeeply disturbed. Then it hit me: the goal of the producers was to get people to TURN AWAY from the Bible! Aha! Now it makes sense. And with that as its goal I am able to say that this ""production"" is pretty much a resounding success.

5456079,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Had to have it after watching it on tv during Easter.  A lot of talk about how their were errors in the story, but so what!  It made folks go to their bible and confirm.  It allowed folks to talk about those bible stories that might not have had the nerve to do so before.

5456085,5,B00AMR5FGA,At a time when most of what you view on tv is trash talk or non-stop sex.  It was refreshing to watch this mini-series.  I bought this as a gift for a family member.  Though they did take a little dramatic license (ninja angels in Sodom) it was a good representation of the Bible from Genesis to the Gospels.  I recommend you view it with an open Bible.,1370476800,,353,4.147058823529412

It will stir your heart and does a very good job of showing what Christ did for us to bring us eternal salvation.,1370304000,,270,4.448979591836735
5456106,1,B00AMR5FGA,"This movie was made from the spirit of religion. The religious have no understanding of Jesus ALONE as Savior. They have created many other ways to God. Just like Passion of the Christ these movies do not come from the Spirit of Christ. God saved me on April 5, 1987 and I still don't have it all together. But one thing I know is that I will not take part in anything that acts like it is coming from the Spirit of God when in fact it is coming from a deceiving spirit.

The sad thing is that so many who call themselves true Christians, those who state that they have been born again of the Spirit, cannot see through the devil's lies and will back anything that calls itself Biblical. Just because it is a movie or miniseries about the Bible or about Jesus does not mean that God has anything at all to do with it. If something is brought forth as Biblical but does not promote the true gospel which leads to true salvation then it is a false gospel presentation. When will God's true Church wake up to this and stop backing such things?",1370304000,4,1040,4.252525252525253

5456113,5,B00AMR5FGA,I'm using the DVD's for my Sunday School class.  The stories are made more vivid than reading & still pictures.  I love it that I can go right to a specific segment & edit out some age inappropriate material.,1370131200,,208,4.3076923076923075

5456115,5,B00AMR5FGA,We have been watching this as a family and it has sparked a love in my children for the Bible.  They go running for their Bible to find the stories to read about them.  This is a great way to get discussions going about God.,1370131200,,224,3.9555555555555557

I did see some things that didn't seem exactly, but the bible can be interrupted differently. I did not see anything that changed the meaning of the stories or the main meaning which was the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I would definately recommend this.  I bought the 2 of the DVD copy for my mom and mother and law. And I bought the Blu-ray copy for myself.",1370044800,,462,4.372093023255814
5456121,4,B00AMR5FGA,Overall I enjoyed the series.  The New Testament coverage was very good and very moving.  The Old Testament coverage I felt took too many detours away from the message of the Old Testament and did not reflect the true meaning.  One overall benefit was that it made me read the Bible to veryify what was really written and what was the Hollywood version.,1370044800,,353,4.571428571428571

5456142,5,B00AMR5FGA,"In a series like this, there are some points of delicacy, four flashpoints. These production problems are common to all Bible epics--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quo-Vadis/dp/B001QW8QYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quo Vadis</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur-The-Ten-Commandments-Blu-ray/dp/B00AMSLDW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben-Hur / The Ten Commandments [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greatest-Story-Ever-Told/dp/B001EBULU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greatest Story Ever Told</a>, or this one.

The first flashpoint is Selective Streamlining. The Bible is a large book. The Catholic version has 73 books total: 39 in the Old Testament, 27 the New Testament, plus 7 in the Apocrypha. And there are more disputed texts--151 Psalm, and 3 and 4 Maccabees.

How do we manage this bulk? Simple: we employ Selective Streamlining. This means we eliminate sections, stories, people and events. Hence, our favorite Bible story may be eliminated to make room for the overall flow. Think of the trade-off between strong episodes versus strong story arcs and you see the balancing act.

This was handled well, with the main miniseries arc being the establishment of Israel, from Abraham to Jesus. And each episode is a strong standalone.

The series began with the Flood, and showed Eden in flashback. All the minor prophets and Joseph of Egypt were eliminated, and also the Tower of Babel, and the adult Solomon.

This, of course, is not sacrilegious, but a creative necessity.

Tied to this is the level of graphicness--how bloody do you make it? Following Mel Gibson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-Of-The-Christ-Definitive-Edition/dp/B007HU4FZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion Of The Christ Definitive Edition</a>) and the recent revival of Sword and Sandal flicks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B005DNO7MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>), they have erred on the side of more. This is also a touchy area, since blood can be a turn-off to some people. And it can be a turn-on in the wrong way.

Even so, I consider these words helpful:

""Should the little children of the kindergarten be taught the events leading up to and culminating in the death of our Savior? It is a principle widely accepted that it is not desirable to teach these little ones those things that are horrifying to childish natures.  ... But death is not an unmixed horror. With it are associated some of the profoundest and most important truths of human life. Children should be taught early in life that death is really a necessity as well as a blessing, and that we would not and could not be satisfied and supremely happy without it. Upon the crucifixion and the resurrection of  Jesus, one of the grandest principles of the gospel depends. If children were taught this early in life, death would not have the horrifying influence that it does have over many childish minds.""

Amen!

Literary License is the second flashpoint. Simply put, this is where we tweak, tease, or trump historical facts. The segment on King David has him dancing both before the Lord and with Bathsheba, and then later sitting with Solomon on his lap, playing with the model of the temple. It did not happen this way (as the record stands), but it gets the main message across quickly and succinctly.

This is a personal bugaboo of mine, and a main reason why I do not like historical fiction, or docudramas. (History is sacrificed to art, which means tit is not history.) But, for their part, Burnett/Downy handles this well, even for a critic like myself.

The third flashpoint is Archeological Assessment. This covers all things of historical fact. Did they really dress that way? Did the building look that way, or did they changes things to fit the needs of the sound stage, the producer's and the director's taste, and the budget?

Some historical questions are settled as best we can settle these things. Others are open. Some are disputed. Some things are just not known.

Burnett/Downy have been following the trend away from DeMillian lushness and pageantry to more historically and archeologically sound presentation. Colors are subdued, sets have a George Lucas dirtyness and lived-in feeling, and leads do not necessarily have to be blue-eyed Norsemen. Again, this series does well in this area.

Fourth, and the most explosive, are the Doctrinal Disputes. How Jewish, Roman Catholic, Protestant, or Evangelical do you make the series? You must include the ""upon this rock"" quote which is important to Catholics, you have ""born again"" dialogue  for Protestant thought, theosis for the Eastern Orthodox faithful, and the ""other sheep"" quote  and Joseph of Egypt for Mormons (the last two not being included).

An essential quote, well-placed, here and there affirms faith.

On the other hand, how do you depict baptism? This film solves this no-win situation by showing several types: immersion, effusion (pouring), partial immersion, but no aspersion (sprinkling).

This question will never be settled this side of the Second Coming. But the workable, short-term solution for this is a sophisticated understanding that such things are disputed, and that other people believe other things. It should also motivate us to form our own opinions by going back to the source text.

And that is the point of these films. Like the old Filmation cartoons of the 1970s and 1980s, the moral of the episode is to go back to the original source text--read your Bible!",1369785600,,5690,5.660399529964748

5456150,2,B00AMR5FGA,"A mini series on the bible is a big challenge, but I am sorry to say this has too many shortcomings to fill the need. The casting and acting is very inferior; as an example Moses has a permanent leer and seems almost to be on drugs! Bleeding chunks are inevitable with such a project but the script writing and dialogue is appalling, the sort of thing one would expect in a C grade movie. On the positive side the locations and special effects are excellent and the costumes, picture and sound very good so it is even more of a pity the script and acting is so bad. Another irritant is that each 47 minute episode starts with a recap and ends with a preview of the next episode. Unfortunately one cannot skip these as they are not linked to the chapter points and one loses part of the episode itself. Poor planning and another example of sloppy quality control. I am sure it is politically correct to cast a number of African Americans but I wonder how historically accurate that might be. Accents are all over the place representing a diverse cast but some are a bit hard to take!
I am sure many Christians will want to see this, good or bad, but my advice would be rent at best or catch it on the box as I really doubt it will get many repeat viewings. I hesitate to say bring back Charlton Heston, all is forgiven, but this offering is deeply flawed and a million miles away from Ben Hur!",1369785600,4,1392,4.276515151515151

5456163,3,B00AMR5FGA,"This is a beautiful show. The cinematography is fantastic, but at times it feels like all form and flawed substance. Elements are added to some of the stories, often gratuitously. For example, there's a sword fight added into a passage in the Bible that had no sword fight. Other rather important Bible stories are either omitted entirely or given very short shrift. The miniseries reminds me a lot of ""modern day"" paraphrase translation of the Bible - watered down, but still having some of the message. If that's what it takes to appeal to today's audience, I guess it's a success, but I found The Passion of the Christ a much better, more informed extrapolation from the Bible into a successful movie.",1369612800,,704,4.778688524590164

5456168,5,B00AMR5FGA,"How can you go wrong with the Bible?  Haven't watched all of the discs yet, but what I have seen is remarkable.  The Bible is not for the faint of heart, there is a lot of violence, hatred, jealousy and evil in it, but what it shows you is that from the beginning of time after Adam and Eve sinned, the world has always dealt with the same problems.  Sometimes we think we have a monopoly on what is going on in this generation, but the Bible shows that there has always been the same fight between good and evil.  I have read this marvelous book, so I know the end of the story, but can't wait to see how they depict it in this miniseries.",1369612800,,640,4.055555555555555

5456173,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I have watched a few episodes here and there.  It's just wonderful!!  When I read the Bible, I don't know how different characters feel.  Whatever my understanding of a Biblical story is, it stays as descriptive words.  This drama allows me to remember and feel each character so much more ( and I like the fact that the producer has consulted various Bible scholars).  For example, when Jesus calls Peter to be fishers of man, it's just a dialogue where Peter witnessed a miracle from Jesus and was convinced that Jesus was a God.  However, in the movie, it portrayed Peter as being somewhat frustrated about not being able to catch any fish as well as being a bit worried initially.  When Jesus came, the way the Jesus asked Peter must have meant so much more.  There was Peter, feeling insignificant and useless, not able to even bring food to the table. But Jesus offered him not only real provision ( lots of fish), Jesus seemed to imply in the tone of voice that what you are about to do with me is going to bring fulfillment and meaning to life, of which he seemed to have none.  That was just one example.  There is another example of the way Sarah laughed when she was to old to have children.  In the film, the laugh was this bitter laugh with a bit of sorrow.  In other words, I could see so much more how she was feeling.  Anyway, you really have to read the Scriptures first and then watch the DVD.  It does simplify the details of the Bible here and there, but I guess the purpose is to keep it under a certain length.  Over all, it's a great tool to supplement the Bible study, and keep events connected and together,",1369526400,,1632,4.357615894039735
5456174,5,B00AMR5FGA,"It was a very interesting adaptation of the Bible, never meaning to be a purely historical film but certainly getting it's message across exactly as it should have.

All actors look like amateurs. But gradually this series get better and better toward the end, make it more insightful to watch, more professional, more well writing and more better acting. In refer to Abraham and Moses' clips in this series, I do really get sick with the movie script that keeps repeating: ""...we will have many children as many as the stars..."", the person acting as Moses is nothing in compare with Charlton Heston but the guy who acts as Jesus Christ looks in balance with Jim Caravello in Passion of The Christ. I do wish that History Chanel will re-edit those ""TERRIBLE"" 3 first clips then this series about The Bible will stand up with time like The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner.",1369353600,,959,4.714285714285714

Unfortunately, this ""Epic Series"" was unsuccessful in communicating any of the spiritual truths of the Bible, and there were many inconsistencies with the literal Bible.  Furthermore, it was extremely violent and disgusting.  Every other scene is someone getting their head chopped off or throat slit, with blood flying everywhere.  This series was more interested in keeping people entertained then communicating truths.  Some of the episodes literally made me cringe, they were so repulsive and inaccurate.  In the old Testament episodes, the God of Israel was shown to be a ruthless, arbitrary God who commanded the Israelites to war with other nations, but there were no mentioning of the fact that the people of the lands were wicked, worshiping false gods and doing evil deed of child sacrifice and temple prostitution.  There was also no mention of God being a holy and just God who hates wickedness.

Darwin Shaw (Peter) brought out a ""non-scary"" portrayal that was so very different than what I was taught in parochial school. Diogo Morgado (Jesus) must have had devine intervention to play such a humble, gentle and loving man or, that is his actually his personality.

5456218,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Things do not have to be perfectly done... Too much in the Bible to be insert in a min. 10 hrs DVD. Overall, it offers the basics you need to know about the Bible. You're at least now no longer blind when someone talks to you about the Bible. It really reassured my faith in GOD.",1369094400,,279,4.0
5456219,5,B00AMR5FGA,"very well done, a must for any Christian not wonder the atheists hate this type of movie, they prefer the dark side",1369094400,,115,4.2727272727272725

5456222,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I watched this on TV and was mesmerized by the scope of this miniseries.  I was able to watch the entire thing back to back and it took days but it was so worth it!!!
Then I had to order it for my son, who is a minister, he and his son watched it together.  It was soooo good according to them also.
The thing is you need to watch it at least twice .  The first for the timeless story. The second to try to spot the devil in the background.  The way they portrayed him was exceptional.
The actor playing Jesus was superb. Just looking in his eyes you feel at peace.",1369094400,,565,3.9298245614035086

5456224,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I didn't get to see the whole mini-series when it aired on TV; I missed some parts of two of the episodes so I'm glad this was available to buy.  My son (who is currently questioning his faith) mentioned wanting to see it and I thought it was written and acted so well, he wouldn't be turned off by it. After we watch it, I'll be sure to lend it out to friends and coworkers. Spread the Good News!",1369008000,,397,4.025316455696203
5456225,5,B00AMR5FGA,You will not be disappointed with watching this series - what an inspiring series that is done so well.  It hits all the main bible stories that I grew up with and put them on the screen.  I watched this with my 5 nephews ages 4-13 and they loved the whole thing.  We couldn't even get them to come to dinner because they wanted to finish watching the series.  Great for the whole family and you can watch it over and over.  Must See!,1369008000,,434,4.119047619047619
5456226,5,B00AMR5FGA,It is a beautiful movie that is true to the bible....I ordered the movie so I could watch it again and again.,1369008000,,109,4.0

5456228,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Saw this entire series on TV and loved it. Had to have it to view again, but also to loan to friends who missed it. A must-see. Not your typical ""religious"" series.",1369008000,,164,4.15625
5456229,5,B00AMR5FGA,Very nicely done.  Selections were made throughout the Bible giving you a slice thru time. More a history lesson than theology but it does lead to Jesus and his death. Good acting.,1369008000,,180,4.625
5456230,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This is an awesome depiction of the stories in the Bible.  It certainly made everything come alive to see it visually.  Incredible. It is an added bonus for someone who might of missed the miniseries one night.  Product is fantastic, price was great.",1369008000,,250,4.767441860465116
5456231,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This played flawlessly.  I had no problems with it.  This met all my expectations.  There were no hickups through the entire series.
Good product.",1369008000,,146,5.0

5456233,2,B00AMR5FGA,I was very disappointed that this DVD series has edited out so many of the scenes in the original TV series! The TV series was superior in the total Bible coverage and these DVD series edit out far too many scenes that I found fascinating in the TV series. I would not have purchased this DVD series if I knew how many scenes were edited out.,1369008000,6,342,4.196969696969697
5456234,5,B00AMR5FGA,I bought this for my wife since she enjoyed it so much on television. She was very happy with it. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice gift for anyone regardless of beliefs.,1368921600,,183,4.257142857142857
5456235,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I thought I knew the bible pretty well....This made me see the bible in a whole new light,...I was brilliantly done!  I know I'll  watch this many times...like 10 commandments,,,etc...",1368921600,,184,5.1
5456236,5,B00AMR5FGA,"While it may prove to be too ""adult"" for young children, this miniseries is an excellent presentation of the Bible. It is true to the stories that are presented. Note that it does not portray every story of the Bible. If it did, it would still be showing on TV. It does not shy away from the often violent events discussed in the Bible. This is part of God & man's story. It is inspiring for all.",1368921600,,396,4.1558441558441555

5456238,4,B00AMR5FGA,"This is well done and done with a sincere effort to convey the ""highlights"" of such an eternal book.  I would not have wanted to choose which to include or exclude from this series.  The most recent generations are very visual and auditory and they will at least be introduced and exposed to the basic stories of the Bible.  After all, they are actually the plot lines for a great deal of our literary history.",1368921600,,410,4.44
5456239,5,B00AMR5FGA,This was a well made series. I didn't know what to expect from it but was delighted. Really liked the actors and great work,1368921600,,123,4.166666666666667
5456240,5,B00AMR5FGA,THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS TAPE WITH THE MAIN ORDER WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED.  WE HAD WATCHED THE MOVIE ON TV AND MISSED THE LAST EPISODE. SO NOW WE HAVE THE COMPLETE SHOW.,1368921600,,169,4.451612903225806

5456242,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I gave this set to my 16 year old grandson who doesn't read well because of developmental issues. I felt it would be a good way for him to get more of the story of the Bible and it has been successful in doing so. When he watches movies of any kind, if he likes them, he can remember almost all the script from the story-line. This has been a real winner to accomplish that. He remembers and retains much longer than I can.",1368835200,,423,4.0476190476190474
5456243,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Breath taking, watched it with my grandchildren.  Very close to the bible and it's great with special effects to see the  bible words in pictures.  Thank you",1368835200,,157,4.7407407407407405
5456244,4,B00AMR5FGA,Good Quality! Acting was a little stitlted at times and their were very few name actrs.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about Bible times.,1368835200,,158,4.448275862068965
5456245,5,B00AMR5FGA,"It was such a pleasure to be able to watch this with no commercials! A beautiful adaptation of some very familiar parts of the Bible with great actors and cinematography. For one thing, using mostly unknown actors (for us Americans) helps the viewer focus on the message itself and not on famous celebrities. And,yes, there is much violence, and the Crucifixion scene is difficult and heartbreaking to see, but I feel it is critical to include these execution horrors when its depiction is so common today. We don't need to become complacent with the commmon image, but need to be jolted to recognize the terrible sacrifice our Lord & Savior made for us all. I will watch it many times.",1368835200,,686,4.725
5456246,4,B00AMR5FGA,This is a good movie to remind us of the bible stories that we've forgotten or to show us a different spin on them.,1368835200,2,115,3.8333333333333335
5456247,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The acting is top notch and settings are realistic.  Doesn't stick exactly to scripture, but not so far as to be offensive even to a strong Christian.  My children, ages 10 and 15 loved it.",1368835200,,189,4.371428571428571
5456248,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This miniseries transports you back to the days prior to and during the time of Jesus. While very graphic at times, it is well acted and directed. It is missing parts of the Bible I'd have love to have seen put in the miniseries, but I understand it was only a miniseries and some things could not be included due to time constraints. This is just a great ""must have"" DVD to add to your collection.",1368835200,,398,4.25
5456249,5,B00AMR5FGA,The Bible is very well done ... sometimes the violence is a bit too graphic ... I gained a good understand of the Bible from watching this and I will occasionally watch sections of it to gain a better understanding of that part,1368835200,,227,4.3023255813953485

5456251,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Would like to have seen more time spent on Genesis, Adam & Eve, Moses with Ark, Solomon, Jacob, the Apostles, and Rev. Series could have easily covered more seasons. Acting, makeup, and scenery is great too.",1368748800,,207,4.777777777777778
5456252,4,B00AMR5FGA,Would have liked more of The Creation and Noah. The Old Testament part with Saul dragged on. Would have liked more short clips of other events that is crustal to the Old Testament. Would have like liked more of Jesus journey. Rushed though the end of New Testament. Over all very good in illustrating the Bible for those who do not know of it's story.,1368748800,,351,4.415384615384616

Some people have commented that certain parts were left out, but it would be impossible to do a mini series on the entire bible.  I was pleased to hear the viewership was higher than American Idol, so it must mean that young people were tuning in as well as adults.

5456288,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Ninja angels, Samson getting his eyes pushed out, my 10 year old son thought this series was great.

This series is not the whole Bible. It focuses on major ministries like David and Daniel. Five episodes are devoted to the Old Testament and five to the new.

There's a lot of time spent recaping and previewing of the next episode and it's all done with dramatic music and exciting voice overs. I found this a bit annoying but it really helped my son see the Bible as the story of the people of God and not just a series of unrelated stories.

There's a bit of artistic licence taken and the words spoken are usually not direct from the text. Sarah, for example, realises something is up when Abraham goes off with Isaac (to sacrifice him). She tries to chase after them.

Overall it's a great introduction to the Bible that keeps in the blood, guts and sword play. Some reviewers have argued that the women in the Bible have been left out but Mary Magdalen plays a key role in the New Testament episodes.",1368489600,,1006,4.421621621621622

5456290,5,B00AMR5FGA,"As a Bible believer, I feel that the History Channel got it right.  As another reviewer said, a thread runs through this series that ties it all together.

5456299,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I don't think The Bible: The Epic Miniseries is something you should use for in-depth Bible study.  But, used for any of the following, I find it highly engaging: 1) Introducing Christianity to non-believers, 2) Refreshing yourself on some of the basics of Jewish History and the Church Fathers, and 3) Watching a technically masterful display of major Bible Stories.

The visuals are compelling, from the parting of the Red Sea to breaking the walls of Jericho.  I like the creative license used to depict encounters between humans and God and his angels.  For those with limited knowledge of Jewish history pre-Christ, it actually can help explain the Babylonian exile and return to Jerusalem better than sifting through I and II Kings and Chronicles.  My wife and I have enjoyed every episode.",1368489600,,796,5.0

I do not have the History channel, so this was the only way I could watch this series.  As for the product itself, I don't know how anyone could take something as monumental as the Bible, edit it down, and please everyone.  Some of my favorite scriptures, what I consider some of the most important aspects of the Christian walk, are not included or were watered down, BUT there is no way that a project like this could possibly please everyone all of the time.

I do not claim to be a scholar or able to debate which version of the Bible is the most authentic but I do know this does a good job of portraying the over all story of Christ and the Bible.  Keep in mind that this attempts to cover the entire Bible in 10 or so hours and much is left out.  That is not due to inaccuracy so much as time constraint.  I really enjoyed this as a show while I also appreciated that it caused me to review my faith.  This is worth checking out whether for the purpose of entertainment, history, or faith.",1368403200,,567,4.072072072072072
5456317,1,B00AMR5FGA,"If you are already a Spirit-filled believer in Jesus Christ, I suggest you save your money & time and skip this movie.

I am not the target audience for this video.  I did not like the violence and sexuality it included.  It is not necessary for me to see violence or bare skin to keep me watching a show.  I am quite the opposite in that blood and sexuality cause me to turn a show off.  I do not watch TV shows any longer, so I am not as desensitized to such things as I used to be.  This is definitely a made-for-TV movie.  I was expecting something different.  I wish I could get my money back.

The 2 very small parts I did enjoy is when Adam is shown rising from the dust and when the 4th person (Jesus Christ) is shown in the fire with Daniel's 3 friends.

This movie inappropriately contains: children's necks being slit, men's eyes being gouged out, back-view of a topless woman bathing.  Even though all those things really happened as they are recorded in the Scriptures, that does not mean I need to see it (merely implied or really shown).  I can think of other stories recorded in the Bible that would not be appropriate to turn into video.

No matter how great the rest of a movie is, a little bit of filth in it spoils the whole thing for me.",1368403200,4,1258,4.2133891213389125

5456321,4,B00AMR5FGA,"The series tried to tell the stories most talked about from the Bible. That's a incredible task given the amount of material covered in the Bible, therein lies the difficulty. It doesn't have the depth, sensory impact I expected.

5456322,2,B00AMR5FGA,I am a Sunday School Teacher for more than 20 years and have viewed all the individual stories of the bible in Dvd. Bible in Dvd or animated version is suitable for new Christians. This version is highly brutal and violent killings for the first two CDs. Because this is a Mc Donald's version of the Bible the fast paced sequence does not explain the Old Testament to young children as well as adults who are begging Christians. If you buy this DVD view first the 3rd and 4 th Dvd because this is about Jesus and the mild violence of the crucifiction is enough for five hours. The Bible covers only ten books of the bible. Five from old and five from new. This is a one time viewing DVD collection because the first two CDs is about battles tortures suicide and violent deaths. I would take caution sharing this DVD to young Christians and children. It is better to buy individual DVD of the bible collection individual  stories. If you want to learn the timeline of the bible amazon sells bible timeline in ten feet for young and begging Christians. Spare yourself from the violence similar to the bloody the passion DVD of Mel Gibson. Jesus Christ Musical superstar the movie better for children there is also a broadway. Again bible timeline for children and young believers can learn better from the bible timeline without the stressful sight of slitting throats and several standings and sword killings.,1368403200,,1408,4.6546184738955825

I found myself acutally quoting lines from the Bible, along with the actors in the series. The photography was awesome -- the parting of the Red Sea was so realistic. The birth of Christ brought tears to my eyes as everyone kneeled.  The walk of Christ carrying the cross before he was crucified was heart wrenching, but I am sure close to what it may have been like as written in the Bible.  I was so impressed with the story being close to what is actually written in the Bible, I bought it.  I have shared it with family members since who were also impressed.

There were some scenes which I wouldn't agree completly. I understand that the director has taken some freedom to imagine how thing really happened given that the Bible itself is very concise many times to describe the facts. But in those places where the Bible is more abundant with details, I would've prefer that they were taken exactly as they were written.

5456355,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Indeed this is a good telling of the Bible - however brief... perhaps someone should be looking at a full series to cover the Bible entirely and the drama that means more to us now than ever. Have to admit I would have liked to have seen a lot more and we are still copying the same old version of Jesus' birth - the wise men, the babe and all that. We need to start telling the actual story a little more accurately and not reverting to past depictions as these movies so often do - there is plenty of scope there but for some reason no-one seems to be taking advantage of it and actually telling a more historically accurate account as it is laid down in the scriptures. Liberties for characters not mentioned in the Bible can be taken for dramatic license if actually worrying who said what or if it is accurate... but it is time to actually read and TELL what is actually in the Bible - word for word and be carefulof those clich versions.

In all, I loved the series but still feel we are not making anything gut-wrenching new here and I give the producers top marks for at least getting the Bible back in our minds. Some great special effects!!!",1368230400,,1151,4.279816513761468

Of course it can`t cover everything in the Bible but takes some of the best Bible stories from the Old Testament and covers the life,  death and resurrection of Jesus in The New Testament also the disciples persecution. And Paul`s works. Ends with Revelations. This  was so interesting that I watched all of it in one day. The actors did an amazing job. The four disc set includes ten episodes so be sure you play each disc all the way through so you do not skip any of the episodes. I plan to buy several more to give as gifts for Christmas.

5456371,4,B00AMR5FGA,"My wife and I bought this dramatized version of the Bible for our small group movie night starting up in the summer. It's not meant as a teaching tool and takes liberties at some points where the Bible doesn't exactly describe how an event happened. That said, it has been really enjoyable and brings a bit more color to the Bible text. Overall, it has a strong ""trust in the LORD"" theme and does point to the Messianic coming of Jesus throughout the Old Testament. I give it a 4 but encourage others to read their Bible if you want a teaching tool.",1368230400,,549,4.339805825242719

Acting was very good and story was mostly accurate in my knowledge of the Bible.

5456374,5,B00AMR5FGA,"It was alive and exciting to view.  One could feel the presence of the Holy Spirit in some of the scenes. It was tastefully and well done in a way that could even hold the interest of a non-believer. And I understand that many have come to Christ through this DVD. I have a hard time watching some of the older slow Bible stories made into movies, but with this one, I could not wait to see the next part.
It is a blessing and I am glad it is available to us.",1368144000,,459,3.935483870967742

I really appreciated the way the New Testament was treated.  Much of the life of Christ has been filmed so this series focused, as I recall, on some of the less sensational parts.  I'll watch it again.",1368144000,,354,4.384615384615385

I don't think they were that bad in biblical times! It didn't even follow much of what The Bible says, scenes added for drama. I couldn't finish it. I gave it to a friend who wanted it (why I do not know), otherwise it would've gone in the trash! A waste of money! Adele",1368144000,6,399,4.063291139240507

And how low budget Sci Fi was this, the giant wasn't that big and then he gets knocked out by a pebble??? Come on they could have done better then that all those swords and a pebble is what does it??? Seems like a lot of horse crap to me.

Side Note:  I did like how they included UFO's in the background of every story.  It was like all this crazy crap was happening because some extra terrestrials were controlling them, KUDOS.",1368144000,2,592,4.25

5456392,4,B00AMR5FGA,"This Series is an Introduction to the Bible so you can get an understanding of what to expect if you decide to read it. I'm not religious and I don't go to church, but my favorite is the Episodes on Jesus. I had to watch it about 3 times to really understand what's going on because what he says you have to think about it. Its like when you read a poem and it has these metaphors. I see Jesus as a great motivator. He always knew what to say and his quotes and the words he says is very Powerful. ""He who lives by the sword dies by the sword"", I tell you that this building will not have one stone left standing."" In the temple when he flipped tables and called everyone Hypocrites. Jesus is to be taken seriously. Give to Cesar what is Cesar and give to God What is God. The Great Message is to Forgive, even if the person has betrayed you, hurt you, lied to you, whatever it is, because by forgiving others you are really forgiving yourself. when you stay mad at the other person it bothers you in the inside.  Must I say more, Now Go, watch the Miniseries and it will change your life.

5456397,5,B00AMR5FGA,I thought it moved along nicely and had great speacial effects.  I did miss the story of Joshep in Egypt.  I did not care for the fighting and the killing of animals.  I do realized that this was part of the true strory line.  Very good.  Thanks for all the creatfvie efforts put in to the production of the miniseries.  I would not want small children to see it because of the killings.  The actor who played Jesus did a very good job of bringing across the personality and love of Jesus.

5456399,4,B00AMR5FGA,This video was very well done - informative and it followed the Bible quite closely. Our only concern was that the DVD for home use (the one we received) could have left out the recaps for each week that were on the History Channel version where the viewer got to see clips from the previous week. We could fast forward through these so it wasn't a major concern.,1368057600,,363,4.352941176470588

For believers this is the word of God and the stories are much more than just stories. I am glad that someone in Hollywood had the courage to make a mini-series based on the Bible but to anyone familiar with the Bible you will see that they took a lot of liberties with telling the stories and context was lost. For instance, John the Baptist is beheaded by Herod but we are left to believe that he was beheaded simply because Herod did not like him. We lose the context that it was Herod's wife who asked her daughter to ask for John's head on a platter after she had danced for Herod. Also, we see Jesus with His disciples but for the sake of time the stories are so shortened that we get no interaction between the characters to develop relationships between the people. Also, Mary Magdalene is shown with the disciples as though she was one of the inner circle. While she is prominent in scripture the bible does not suggest that she was one of His disciples, traveling everywhere with Jesus. If this series stirs interest in the bible and gets more people to come to faith then thank God, but it could have been much better.",1368057600,,1262,4.329113924050633

If you are a real student of the bible you will find this very annoying at the liberties taken with scripture and important details deleted. Would be a good opener of interest in the bible and would recommend buying an edition of the Good News or NIV version and  a copy of a 60's or 70's edition of Halley's Bible Handbook for easy reading and understanding.

5456449,4,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible miniseries hits all the highlights and main ""storyline"" of the Bible.  However, many of the details of the stories are altered/added to/left out.  People described in the bible are left out of the story, or timelines are compacted, presumably for time editing of the series.  For example, in the story of Samson, The Bible describes his father and mother but the miniseries does not introduce Samson's father at all.  How Samson comes to meet his wife and what happens to her is altered, as well as how he comes to meet Delilah.  Overall, entertaining and casting was, in my opinion, very good.

 1) Some of the actors couldn't act at all and they were boring and indifferent.

 2) To cover the whole bible series in so little time it was impossible and so this series left out a lot of stuff...(Isaak, jacob, esther, jeremiah...etc)

 3) Almost half of the series was only about jesus.

 If u are a die hard fan then u can add this to your collection but if u want the complete bible series then buy instead the 17 dvd series which were prodused a few years ago covering the complete lives of abraham, isaak, jacob, jeremiah, solomon and others plus a whole movie just for the GENESIS and more.",1367712000,2,650,4.31404958677686

Of course some favorite stories are left out, but there is enough there to encourage people to read the ""original manuscript"". I was particularly encouraged that it touched on Revelation even though briefly and did an admirable job of presenting the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.

They also did John's Revelation at the very end. Awesome videography and special effects. Plus the actor playing Jesus is easy on the eyes. And then, of course, there is the Satan character who is spitting image of BHO.  See for yourself.",1367625600,,561,4.783505154639175
5456559,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The film makers brought the audience into the character's time.  The tension between Sarah and Hagar was apparent, but minimal.  Also, the ethnic characters were long overdue; which affected one commenter who felt the ""original people""should have been used.  The Bible scholars did not assume, as many do, that all significant biblical characters were European.  I saw Jeffrey Hunter in ""King of Kings"" but his performance was somewhat wooden despite his  physical beauty.  On the other hand, Diogo Margado was vastly better in each category.  He humanized Christ and let us see his beauty, wisdom and his emotions.

There was only one scene that was not Biblical and it was the Lazarus scene but all things considered it was just amazing. I would recommend it to anyone seeking to understand the Love of Jesus for His creation. The actor who portrayed my Lord did a awesome job demonstrating the love and compassion of Jesus. Thank you Roma and your husband for following the prompting of the Holy Spirit and bringing the Bible to life.

This brings stories of the Bible into clear focus with incredible acting, effects and drama.  The popularity of this, more than anything else provides proof of it's quality and the hunger for the story to be told and heard and seen.

5456589,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This is one awesome series! We don't have cable, so we where unable to view this series on the history channel. We pre ordered this series and could not wait to get this series. With a busy life, we also wanted the option to watch The Bible when we wanted to.

What a treat we were in for! This series is full of excitement just like the word! Our children love this series and even know which stories are which! This drew their attention and kept them wanting more!

The word is the best anytime any day! You will enjoy this series. You will learn so much. This series is quality, truth, anointed and so much more.

I always did love Touched by an Angel and Highway to Heaven. We own all of the Highway to Heaven that have been released and only need one more season of Touched by an Angel to complete that series. The Bible will make a great addition to your library!

Thank you to the producers and to the history channel for having the courage to air this much needed story! All we have is Abba, and we need series like this to humble ourselves and to turn back to our Abba.

We don't have cable because of all the trash on T.V. now days, so this is a breath of fresh air!

We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and inspiration! Great for family time! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.

We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set individually as it was more affordable to purchase that way. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time..

So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price on pre paid order.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo, Animal plant etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show and Touched by an Angel since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show!

If you are looking for more shows and T.V. like this, try Sky Angel Fave T.V. you will find so many great shows similar to High Way To Heaven and Touched By An Angel.

Happy viewing!  We need real T.V. to come back.. We will not pay for paid for T.V. with all of the trash that is on it.

We educate and entertain ourselves on everything except the word.. We need to educate our selves on the Lord and stand on the word.

Again, thank you for making this series! This is a blessing and for all who support this series, you will be blessed!

To the producers, please make more series like this. It is needed and the demand is there for clean T.V.

Enjoy and feast on the word of the Lord!",1367625600,,4021,4.030150753768845

Then UPS would not acknowledge the package sitting in a secure area waiting for their pick up.  After their last attempt @ ignoring the package, they left a label and never returned to pick it up.

I contacted Amazon, but received no responses other than a label from UPS.

Almost all DVDs ordered will not play in my American CD (or it will play once and not again).  I do not understand why this happens, but it does.  If the DVD or CD is something old and uninteresting to most, I have no problem with it.",1367539200,,786,4.058441558441558

5456629,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Nothing is as good as reading the actual Bible, but the concise, chronological presentation of Biblical stories in this series is a good starting point for someone who has never read the Bible. To someone who know the Bible, you must have an understanding that some details are missing. But really how can you possibly do a movie production of the Bible in ten episodes? Worth viewing, check it out!",1367539200,,399,4.714285714285714

We thought the last few episodes (Jesus' story) and how they presented the gospels were very well done. Worth a watch at least.",1367539200,,313,4.147540983606557

My 3 and 4 year old were allowed to see some segments with me filtering a bit and they thoroughly enjoyed it.

5456635,3,B00AMR5FGA,"I felt as though I was watching a Cliff Notes form of the Bible. It was a huge undertaking to make this series, but I felt they just lightly touched on many of the stories without giving much information. I would have rather seen it go a few more episodes than see what they finished with. Yes, it would have cost more money to lengthen the series, but as it stands, I didn't like it very much.",1367539200,,394,4.12987012987013
5456636,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Loved it. I would have liked it a little better if they used actual wording from the Bible in a few obvious places. Example: when John the Baptist saw Jesus, he said, ""Behold!, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world""! But in this scene he said nothing like that. It was just missing the mark on a few of those type of things that would have been very easy to get right. But I still thing they did a great job, better than has ever been done before. 2 thumbs up!",1367539200,,476,3.96875

5456640,4,B00AMR5FGA,"This ""movie"" is well done. Stays pretty close to ""Biblical"".  Watch it with an open mind - remember it's trying to reach a lot of ""different""  people in a short amount of time and we all have our own ""take"" on how it really is or should be...
Though it may not be ""word for word"", if you think about it, it doesn't 'hurt the truth' of it.",1367539200,,338,3.9558823529411766
5456641,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I like the series. Would be a great tool to reach an unchurched person. Gives an overview of some of the most important  passages in the Bible. However, it is not for young children since it has a rating of TV14 on it due to violence.",1367539200,,234,4.086956521739131

While some of it might be altered a bit, according to which version of the Bible you read, it is still very accurate.  People, let's face it, the Bible contains two centuries worth of history, so to put it into 10 hours of film, you have to be selective on the stories you focus on.  I thought it was well done!  My children enjoyed it as well.",1367539200,,453,4.056179775280899

5456645,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I saw this on the mini-series and hated all the commercial, watching this without commercial inturruption was even better. This is a wonderful story towatch with your children and to get a sense of what happened in the Biblical times.",1367539200,,234,4.875
5456646,5,B00AMR5FGA,The series was very well done and was able to convey the message of the Bible.

5456667,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Some rather important things were skipped throughout the series. As an example, in the New Testament, it appears that the angel of the Lord comes to Mary and within five minutes she's at least 5 months pregnant and disappointing Joseph. Her visit to Elizabeth, her cousin, who was pregnant with John the Baptist, doesn't come into play at all and since it is during this event that Elizabeth recognizes Mary as carrying the Savior, it should have probably been at least mentioned. There are also parts missing during the ministry of Christ which attest to the character of Christ and God. There were some scenes which bear more inference of the individual reader than the Bible allows (such as Christ's visions while being tempted by Satan in the desertwhich is not in the Scriptures). Insofar as the Old Testament is concerned, a good few chunks of Genesis (hardly anything about Noah) are missing and it really only picks up at Chapter 17. Exodus is briefly touched on, and then it seems to jump to Judges very quickly. Some of the OT parts also appeared more theatrical than Scripturalsuch as the ""ninja angels"" coming to rescue Lot, which really appeals more to movie magic than what was intended. Despite this, i realize that it isafter alla movie/movie series, and there's no way you can fit every event of the Bible in such a constrained timeframe. Most of what was in the movie did seem to try to adhere to Scriptures (with a bit of splash here and there) and that's good. Hopefully, the movie makes people more interested in learning more and actually reading the Bible themselves. If this is so, its purpose becomes completely valid. Overall, I liked it.",1367452800,,1664,4.7612456747404845
5456668,5,B00AMR5FGA,"A beautifully rendered, deeply touching movie.  It has brought the Bible to live for me and my grandchildren, and I truly appreciate the work and dedication that obviously went into the making of this movie.",1367452800,,207,4.914285714285715

5456671,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible mini series was a moving experience for me.  I could not watch it when it came on TV which disappointed me greatly.  It is now one of my collections of all time favorites which I will see over and over again.

I have never read The Bible from cover to cover and this mini series did cover the major events quite well.  It gave me another fresh look at history that revealed how just a few chosen people changed the whole world.  In 2013 the world needs to take a look back and see through history the mistakes made so that they are not repeated.  Then all the promises made in The Bible will come to past and the planet will be a better place.

So another look may be all one needs to change course from bad to good.  The Bible mini series offers that other look.",1367452800,,773,4.1066666666666665

Was awful......you have to watch what is comming in next episode....after each section and then review what you just watched before you can watch the next episode....very annoying if you want to watch 1 entire disc

5456717,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made. Is it missing parts? Of course, but if they put the whole bible to film it would be like 50 hours long. Instead they covered all the really important and non-redundant stories.",1367366400,,228,4.585365853658536
5456718,2,B00AMR5FGA,"When I first saw the commericals for this, I was of course skeptical.  But then I did a little research to see who was making the movie, and what they based it on, and so forth, I got a bit more confidence in it.  I was encouraged when reading that they had theologians and scholars on hand throughout the process and that they based it off the NIV and one other translating that I'm forgetting at the moment.  But they never named the theologians or the scholars, and never clarified if it was the new or original NIV translation.  But I thought that they were at least working to keep it as accurate as possible as they claimed, plus it looked really good, so I purchased my own copy.

I think a friend put it best when he said he saw more, and better, special effects in The Ten Commandments than he did in this movie.  It is entertaining, but anyone that knows and studies the Christian bible will see immediately how not accurate it is.  If they'd never made the claim, then I probably wouldn't be so critical.  I understand that they can't fit the entire bible into ten hours of film, but they could have done way better than they did.  So often they would leave out just one sentence of critical importance, or pull together books of info into one scene in a way that doesn't fit.  You can say they left out AT LEAST 90% of the bible, and then was possibly 50% accurate with the maybe 10% that they kept.

They play Mary (not the mother of Jesus) to be a desciple, and never even mention that there were twelve of them (men only), and half of them don't even look like they belong there.  One looks like a skin head.  It really is the Reader's Digest version of the bible with lots of creative licensing along the way.  I don't fault them for trying to fill in areas that the bible doesn't give us details on, but acurately portraying the details is does give is something they can be faulted for not doing.

But as I said, it is entertaining.  I did also find that they gave a unique perspective that others have not shown before that I found interesting, such as Jesus constantly thinking forward to his crucifixion in the mist of daily life.  Or of how appart of the ministry Mary MIGHT have been, though my understanding of culture at that time period doesn't completely fit the image they've portrayed of her.  I can't say whether or not you should buy it for your collection or not, but I can say that if you do, then understand that it's not ""Bible.""  It's missing too many details and scews too much on many of the details that it does cover.  Of course it may be a good reason for you to go back and read your bible and compare it to the movie for yourself and make your own judgements.",1367366400,,2702,4.291913214990138

Sure, there is alot of violence in the OT, but there are many, many other significant events, as well, which were not even touched upon in the miniseries.  This work makes the bible look like a blood bath. There is no balance. This may not be a big deal for those who have read the bible, but what about the people watching who have not read the bible?  Also, so many events were misrepresented.  Why change someone's words and actions when the bible makes them very clear? (For example, when Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead.) I was so excited to watch this program, but now my heart sinks any time I think about it. What a shame.",1367280000,7,758,4.431654676258993

5456758,3,B00AMR5FGA,"The producers stated that these were representations of Bible stories and supposed to be true to the spirit of the Bible. However, numerous small errors, such as a leaking Noah's ark, and omissions such as Peter's dream before his visit to Cornelius, renders this presentation dubious at best. The Bible stories should have been presented accurately. The last part was the worst. Traditions, according to the Roman Catholic Church, were presented as true but are not. Peter never went to Rome. Thomas never went to India. John was exiled to Patmos but was never poisoned. Also, Saul of Tarsus had his name changed to Paul, after his conversion on the road to Damascus. I realize that any presentation of Revelation would be difficult. However, the small bit, which was shown, did not do justice to or properly present Revelation.  Also, the Bible does not state that Jesus showed the hole in hand to John. He showed it to Thomas, after His resurrection. It would have been better if the presentation on Revelation, had been left out, rather than presented as it was. The producers could have done a much better job.",1367193600,,1115,4.837696335078534

I didn't agree on some of the choices of actors,
but then again mark burnett and roma downey produced it out of their own pockets, so props.
As for Jesus' actor...almost perfect!!!

There was also some controversy on the series in regards to the adding of narrative not found in the Bible.
This is true, but only in a few minor cases will those who've read the passages disagree with the producers choice,
but in general, it will comfort the faithful and enlighten those who are coming in contact with the story for the first time.

5456761,5,B00AMR5FGA,the history channel out did there self with this movie !!!! the movie was so well done and the graphics was outstanding.and the price was right on target. great job,1367193600,,164,4.5
5456762,5,B00AMR5FGA,"BEAUTIFULLY DONE! I loved watching it, and it's very Historical in the beginning, but well worth it. Great movie! ORDER NOW! Great price, also. I looked for it on Fox and their price was about DOUBLE! ORDER IT THROUGH AMAZON.",1367193600,,225,4.65
5456763,5,B00AMR5FGA,This is an excellent miniseries and our whole family watches it together.  We've seen it three times since we received it and will watch it again and again.,1367193600,,156,4.571428571428571

5456765,2,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible Mini Series hits low with me. The Old Testament is about all the wars fought, nothing about the JOYS of Living with the LORD. The New Testament has a few misguided entanglements, and are not pinpoint accurate. The production of the video is difficult to navigate through,(the menu, and long periods of previews before and after a chapter). The filming is awesome, the story line is not. Nice try of getting Most of it on film, it just fell a bit short. I would rather suggest that new believers read the Bible for themselves, and not take The Bible Mini Series as Truth of the Word. Please Read it for yourselves.
God Bless.",1367193600,,634,4.521739130434782
5456766,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Best review of Bible that I have seen.  Spectacular technology; first-class effort to bring the Bible to life.  Great thread of faith and need to listen and obey the inspirations God places on our hearts--runs all the way through the movie.  I watched it on the History Channel, but much better without commercials--ties it all together more effectively.",1367193600,,354,5.068965517241379
5456767,5,B00AMR5FGA,I think everyone should watch this movie. I watched it in 5 parts on T.V. and had to have it so we can enjoy it without the commercials.....love this movie. Very moving.......,1367193600,,175,4.5
5456768,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Because this series could not go into great detail, for it would be a longer production to include content, this Bible presentation came across in epic proportions. With good narratives, the Bible story did follow a clear time line. Great cinematography! Beautiful musical score! Should have been made for the big screen movie theaters.",1367193600,,336,5.2407407407407405

The miniseries is so well done that I wish there was more.",1367193600,,126,4.08
5456771,5,B00AMR5FGA,"In their book, Roma and Mark explain how they are not theologians or scripture scholars, but story-tellers that selected some major persons to dramatize. I'm not aware of other movies that began with Genesis and ventured into the Acts of the Apostles and Revelation with such a compelling drama. The inspiration is to go into a read of the Bible, perhaps to a study program to drink in more of this rich experience. Those who find fault in the script miss the mark--it's about catching faith, not trying to teach it.  An excellent work to use for personal enrichment or as a discussion starter for biblical studies.",1367193600,,615,4.747663551401869

5456774,5,B00AMR5FGA,"While the producers did take some liberties with the Bible, it does enough justice to the story to encourage everyone to op[en the Bible and start reading. Yes, it doesn't give all the answers like the Bible does, but hopefully everyone who sees it will feel the need to get those answers from reading the Bible and come to know God as their God.",1367193600,,346,4.421875

5456777,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I had read that this mini-series was epic; nothing could be further from the truth. It was horrible and strayed heavily from The Word. Bizarre character portrayals, incorrect story events, and poor to standard production values made watching this a very disappointing experience and a waste of money and time.

I would highly recommend you save your money and warn others.",1367193600,8,372,5.098360655737705
5456778,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The only thing I picked up, and if you are a student of the Bible or if the Bible is a part of your everyday reading you would pick up on this, is in someplaces certain things were missing. But again I understand that you only have so much time to fit in a whole book. Maybe there could be a part 2, who knows. But I throughly enjoyed it.",1367193600,,338,3.842857142857143
5456779,4,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible was put together very well, and as indicated before each episode, they tried to stay true to the spirit of the scriptures.  Obviously, there are time constraints in trying to put the entire Bible in a mini-series, so, there were key moments missing (key moments I would like to have seen more about) particularly in covering the life of David.  There are certain portrayals I would have done differently based on the context of scripture, however, I do not believe any believer would be disappointed in this film, and our culture certainly could use more entertainment of this quality and nature.",1367193600,,606,4.87378640776699
5456780,5,B00AMR5FGA,Growing up in an extremely religious home I knew a great deal about the Bible. I expected great differences in what I was taught as a child. Although there were a few differences I was very impressed by this miniseries. I only wish it was longer and more of the bible was covered. I felt many chapters were covered very fast and then some were extremely long. I must admit I got out my Bible to compare stories. Great miniseries!,1367193600,,429,4.375
5456781,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Absolutely wonderful!  For those that are familiar with the Bible and those that are not, this is a WONDERFUL miniseries and would be a wonderful purchase.  Make sure you find enough time to sit down.  It takes a while to get through all four DVD's, but it is POWERFUL!!!  I recommend it!!!",1367193600,,290,4.519230769230769
5456782,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I pre-ordered this series & it was well worth it!!

Its one thing spending a lot of your life reading the Word of God & trying to imagine it, BUT visually watching it makes it real & thought provoking. The minor theatrical details that you never think off when you're just using your imagination, jumps out @ you: ie Abraham's relationship with Ishmael/Moses' radicalism...etc..all good.

Nothing can compare with the actual word of God though :)

I'm impressed withh Mark Burnett & Roma Downey for producing this. Our media needs ""celebrities"" who believe in the bible.",1367193600,,570,4.916666666666667

5456787,2,B00AMR5FGA,"If you are going to make a bible movie it must be better than those made in the past. Especially if you are going to boost it up with all the hype such as all the miracles on the set the producers said happen. To date I have yet to see any biblical Jesus movie topple the directing, acting, sets, costumes and the script as Jesus of Nazareth. By far the best ever made and I have watched them all. Granted this was an over view of the bible and I will give them that, but I didn't think the acting and directing was all it was rated up to be. Most everyone I know from church said the same thing.",1367107200,,596,3.9338842975206614

The Bible is violent and we must accept that. The people who made this tried to keep close to the heart of the book and did so with only a few things here and there. Very inspiring.

It seemed like a vehicle to just continually stage way too much of battles and more brutality and very little of acting of the stories.  I know this was somewhat the way of life in Old Testament times, as well as the New, but I quickly grew tired and bored with all of it.  A very big disappointment and I feel I wasted time and money.

Almighty and goes through Jesus' life and death.  It is excellent learning, educational for children and adults
to learn the faith.  Praise God and the makers of this series to teach the word of the Lord to others.  Very good
film and highly rated on History channel when it aired.  Would watch it again and again to learn and supplement
it with the Bible readings. It is also historical and shows how the prophets and kings lived throughout the times preceding the birth of Christ, so you learn so many different stories, too many to list.  Take my word, this is a
wonderful series from the time of creation through the death of Jesus.  You come out with a good understanding of the many years leading up to Jesus' life.  You will not regret this purchase!! Love it!!",1366934400,,979,4.5227272727272725

I was thinking this movie would be more accurate unlike previous depictions. It did pretty good up until here. I can enjoy something more if it is portrayed honestly. If you look at Jews born in the region even today and not immigrated from Europe, they are very swarthy and dark and not very tall. Also the Bible says that there was nothing physical about Jesus that would attract you. He was not handome...his beauty emmenated from the inside and the word He preached. Tired of Hollywood depictions of tall, handsome men as Christ. If you are the History channel make some effort the keep the depiction of the characters true to the Bible. People have grown past needing stereotypical fantasys. We can handle the truth.",1366934400,,860,4.74

5456837,4,B00AMR5FGA,"This was a pretty cool miniseries but it seemed a bit too far fetched. I would prefer it remain more grounded along the lines of something like Clash of the Titans. The effects and acting were above average for a television series and there was tons of sweet sweet violence and not so much sexuality. This is refreshing to me as I abhor the carnal aspects of humanity but relish in its self destruction. I recommend this for the whole family as well as these fine similar films:

1. Clash of the Titans (Avoid Wrath of the Titans)
2. Thor
3. Immortals
4. Beowulf

5456848,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I really liked this version of the Bible.  It touched on the major events and showed enough of the Bible stories to get the most out of it. The acting was great, so were the scenery and costumes.

The only negatives that I heard were that it wasn't exactly true to each Bible story and that it was pretty violent.  However, my response is that many hardships and wars ARE in the Bible stories, especially the major ones like Moses and the 7 plagues, David and Goliath, Jesus' crucifixion, that one can't tell the stories without showing these things and the Bible is so voluminous that one can only take sections out to make the best point of each chapter and verses.

5456857,5,B00AMR5FGA,"So many things set this series apart from other Jesus movies. Besides the fantastic production quality, we noticed so many insights that put the true message of the Gospel into cultural context, and where the Bible words are succinct, this context is deeply meaningful. Jesus was a true radical for the common man. This seems no doubt the intent of Romi and Mark. They did a fantastic work here. I loved how the series went on after the resurrection, how ordinary people were convinced of Jesus' divinity, did not just spread the good news but were willing to die for it.",1366848000,,571,4.663366336633663

I enjoyed this series and more than that, I believe it's important for Christians in a position to spread the Gospel in such an epic manner to do so as often as possible. Our country needs that right now.

Believers need to support efforts like this, not hate on them. I would rather the unsaved be drawn to God by a series that took a few liberties than to miss the point altogether.

For believers and non-believers, who have not seen this at all, Do Not waste money on this!
Each episode shows this message ""This program is an adaptation of Bible stories that changed the world. It endeavors to stay true to the spirit of the book."" which is a false claim.
You are only getting partial truth, for example, It's like going to a restaurant and ordering orange juice; the order taker comes back with one eighth of orange juice in a sixteen ounce cup, then he fills the rest of the cup with water. Would you still consider it being orange juice? No it's so diluted.

The Bible Series takes the Bible and spins it to a completely different story, I do not recommend this to anyone, it is an imitation, because it does not endeavor to stay true to the spirit of the Bible.

For believers, I was really skeptical about these videos seeing it labeled Epic Ministries...
The introduction you are greeted with important people in American history and our current President, Obama. By doing this they glorified the triumphs of man over God.

1) I find it troubling that Abraham and his wife never went to Egypt and that the events never happened there.(Bible Series) VS (Genesis 12 King James Version)
2) The fight between the Herdsmen caused Abram(Abraham) to suggest they go their separate ways. (Gen 13:7 KJV) VS. Lot saying ""It's time we go our separate ways"" (Bible Series)
3) The whole quarrel between Pharaoh's kid and Moses, murder of Egyptian and how the guy Moses helped buried the corpse.(Bible series) VS. (Exodus 2 KJV)

...And then it just throws things in and out that are not mentioned in KJV.
The Bible Series is very, very, bland... It failed to teach many valuable lessons recorded in the Holy Bible.
It removed a large portion of the presence and role God had in the old testament:
What happened to the God who spoke with his loved ones, like how we would have a face to face conversation in our daily lives?
Where is that entity like a best-friend that's over your shoulder, like all the times God talked and instructed Moses, Abraham, and Jacob?
Where is that awe?
For example, when Belshazarr and his companions drank from the Lord's vessels, and a floating hand wrote on the wall judging them.

The Bible series is leavened with drama, deception, and blasphemy!

5456870,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I purchased this DVD after 3 workers at the Christian bookstore recommended it.  I do not have cable, so I missed the showing on TV.  It was so shallow and devoid of any true Biblical teachings.  Sin was never called out for what it is, and the viewer was never given any insight into God's plan for redemption.  Starting with the story of Abraham, it was filled with one bloody, violent battle scene after another with blood spurting out of body parts, and gratuitous slashing and gore, century after century.  The violence went on endlessly, interspersed with minor dialogue between characters.  The character of Jesus was yawningly boring; there was nothing in Him that was compelling as a Messiah, that would draw one to Him.  I have to admit that I made it only as far as Jesus calling his disciples and the beginning of his ministry.  I couldn't watch any more bloody, tortuous scenes.  I returned the DVD to the store and got my money back.  Then, the store workers said, ""Yeah, we've had other people complain about it too.""

The film makers could have made a worthy film by deleting the excessive film footage wasted in the gratuitous bloody battle scenes and dedicate that film footage to a more in depth presentation of man's rebellion, his sinfulness and the need for a savior.  It seems Roma Downey and her husband had good intentions, but gave in to what Hollywood always seems to want: violence.  They could have made a real impact on people's lives by creating a film which focused on the relational issues between man and God, developed the whole sin concept and the need for a savior BECAUSE no one can keep the law.  Yes, show some historically accurate battles and crucifixions since this was the Roman choice of punishment, but leave out the spurting blood and carnage of mutilated bodies lying on the battle field.

I'm afraid this movie would not compel anyone to pick up a Bible to check it out after viewing the movie, which is the ultimate goal here, isn't it?  And people who have not read the Bible or do not know Jesus, may question why would they follow a God that demanded the slaughter of thousands of people (i.e. Jericho, taking of the Promised Land, etc.) without explaining the sin aspect and God's redemption plan.

For any Christian wanting to share God's word with friends, I would recommend, instead, the DVD:  The Gospel of John.  It is an historically accurate portrayal, WORD FOR WORD scripted, of the gospel of John from the Good News Translation of the Bible.  It is brilliantly made with every attention to detail down to the costume fabrics (not a synthetic one in the movie, not a synthetic dye in the fabrics) all artifacts were handcrafted by artisans using tools or the age, etc. etc. etc.  Even the music score was made using ancient instruments from the mid-east.  It was made to look and feel authentic.  You felt like you had stepped into that era of the earth's history.  And the character of Jesus is strong but humble, loving but authoritative in calling out the Pharisees, and compelling.....you are drawn to Him!  And there is no gratuitous violence and blood.  One downside: the flogging was too lightly done.  However, showing an actual Roman flogging would warrant an R rating.",1366675200,70,3240,4.708703374777975

First, consider all the garbage and anti-American values you see on TV and cable, which is why I don't get cable!!!  Based on the garbage out there, I highly recommend this video.  My critical disappointment is that with today's technology and the Bible stories out there on video already, why couldn't they have done a better job.  For instance, when it comes to The Passion, they should have ""hyperlinked"" you to Mel Gibson's awesome movie and not even tried to deal with it in a surface coverage mini-series.  When it came to Moses they should have told you to go watch Charleston Heston's movie.

So the depth and acting is a bit off, but again, look at all the garbage they throw at you on TV and all the cable stations.  Get this movie.

5456881,5,B00AMR5FGA,"In the past two millennia, no other work has had the profound impact on the people of the world as that of the stories found in the Holy Bible. Full of stories about faith, hope, love, courage and sacrifice, these stories continue to inspire millions around the globe. This past March, executive producers Mark Burnett and Roma Downey brought these powerful stories to life in a ten-part miniseries for the History Channel. In less than ten hours, they attempted the daunting task of taking as many of the narrative stories as they could, and fit them into a cohesive narrative. And what they created became the miniseries event of 2013, scoring high ratings, and breathing fresh life into these stories.

The first five parts of this series are devoted to stories from the Old Testament. This proved to be the most difficult part of the Bible to adapt for the miniseries. Consisting of 39 books, and a great many narrative stories, it would be impossible to tell the entire Old Testament in a dramatic way. For the series, the producers focus on seven stories from the first part of the Bible: Creation to the Flood, Abraham, Moses, Joshua and the Fall of Jericho, Samson, Saul and David, and Daniel. These first five episodes can be considered a ""cliff notes"" version of the biblical tales. Each episode covers a good chunk of time, and only hits the highlights of those stories. But what makes these episodes work are the terrific writing, fantastic performances, and beautiful visual effects. Several of the stories (In particular, Abraham commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac, and Daniel and the Fiery Furnace) are very powerful, and will move viewers to tears. Despite the leap-frog over the stories, the acting and writing alone give these five episodes a 9/10, or A-.

The second half of the series is devoted to the New Testament. This is the easier part of the Bible to translate to film. Of the 27 books in this part of the Bible, only five are strict narrative, with four focusing on the story of Jesus Christ. So, telling this story in five hours meant more time for the story to breathe. And it is here that the series hits its high-mark. Once again, the writing is fantastic, and the visual effects well-done. But the highlight of this part of the series is the acting. In particular, Diogo Morgado's soulful portrayal of Jesus. From the first moment he steps on the screen, to the final image of the series, Morgado gives one of the best portrayals of the Messiah on film (Best portrayal still goes to Jim Caviezel in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ-Definitive-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B001JNNDGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], but Morgado ranks a very close second), and will leave many who watch it emotionally connected to Him. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. For this part of the series, I give a 10/10, or A+.

One of the further highlights over the entire program is the amazing score by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe. This work connects all ten episodes emotionally, and really help to pull the full drama out of the scenes. In particular, the same piece of music (entitled ""Faith"" on the soundtrack album) is played over both the scene where Abraham prepares to sacrifice Isaac, and the scene of Christ being crucified. In both cases, you are overcome by what is being seen on film. The acting, writing and music all three come into such beautiful connection in these two scenes, and will definitely make viewers cry.

The Blu-ray release presents the series with terrific picture and sound, and a few extras that give good background information on the making of the series. Overall, ""The Bible"" is a powerful filmed version of some of the greatest stories ever told. Whether you know these stories by heart, or wish to learn what makes these stories so important to over two-billion people worldwide, this miniseries is an excellent place to go. This series comes highly recommended!

5456882,1,B00AMR5FGA,"If ever the phrase ""...and evil shall be called good"" had a place to be used, this is it.
This is not only a bad adaptation, it's not even an adaptation. It's villainous propaganda -- for the wrong side.
If God had standing in copyright law, He should sue.
This is nothing but a continuous run of gore-filled, blood-letting battle, fight, and torture scenes, specifically chosen from Biblical incidents for their ability to be used to misportray both the message and the story. It is gruesome cinematic violence presented merely to engage the viewer's bloodlust, and it never lets up, skipping across decades and centuries to make sure only the most violent themes can be shown.
You'll get the idea early on with the first throat-slashing, and studio blood pouring from the gash onto everything and everybody. This is not a spiritual, religious film. It is simply another industry gore piece, and has no place in any concept of Christianity.
It is also despicable in the harm that it does to the name of Christianity, not only before those who practice it, but before those of other faiths. Imagine what a non-Christian will think viewing this violent distortion of the underpinning elements of Christianity.

5456890,1,B00AMR5FGA,"This horrific video was not deserving of even one star.  It is beyond me how anyone could even watch it. I saw no spiritual value to it at all. It just jumped from one horrific scene of violence to another...throat slashing , head bashing,fighting, angels that were depicted as filthy looking soldiers full of violence hacking and slashing ...blood and gore at every scene.  I felt it was a disturbing piece of trash and very upsetting to watch and a abomination to even associate it with the Bible. The people that created this have no idea at all about the Bible and its message.  I literally threw it in the trash where it belonged and regretted the fact that I supported it by buying it based on so many of those erroneous positive reviews. It lacked any spiritual inspirational value at all and the time that was spent on detailed portraying of violence could have been better spent on portraying qualities and virtues such as devotion, faith,and love of God .",1366502400,9,965,4.631578947368421

Seeing Sampson of the Bible portrayed by a black man with dreadlocks -- complete with a mother inexplicably decked out in African garb -- was too much for any reasonable viewer to be asked to overlook. We had already struggled to ignore the kung fu master who turns up in Episode One to help slay the enemies of Israel.

Hollywood is hopelessly controlled by the maniacal political left and political correctness. Better to take a pass on this series and read a good book instead.

It is quite an interesting depiction of the Bible. I read it everyday, and appreciated the true nature of most of the parts. So much so, watching stirred many emotions inside.
I have to admit though, there were moments I wasn't crazy about. Mainly, I thought it was too quirky a way to show good and evil. Okay, quirky might the wrong term, but more like childish. Do you really want people to believe God had secret warriors of good and evil?? I can't begin to imagine what effect that image would have on impressionable young minds....
Thankfully, those parts are so few and far between, they may not even matter much. In the end, they weren't what I remembered about the miniseries. I was stuck with memories of what I hold dear in the Bible such as Moses and Jesus.
I know a lot of you will love this miniseries, even with the weird way of depicting forces. Don't worry, I loved it in the end too.",1366502400,,974,4.416666666666667

5456902,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I believe this movie should have been named something else. It is named 'The Bible'. Anything named The Bible should be accurate. You can hate me or downrate me for saying it, but it's not me saying it, it's God saying it.

Revelation 22:18-19 18 I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book: 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
I, like others, pray that even one person sees this movie and picks up a Bible and comes closer to God, and an understanding of our innate sin nature, and the need for a savior Jesus Christ. God is love and God is a righteous judge,

Isaiah 46:6 For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;

God is also a God of Wrath, His righteousness demands justice, and justice demands vengance.

Romans 12:19 Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, ""Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,"" says the Lord.

I know that when I stand before God I don't want to rely on my own 'good' deeds to get me into heaven.

Romans 3:25 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood--to be received by faith.

And by faith I am made righteous, not by my deeds or actions, but by His sacrifice.
Having said all that, the inaccuracies and details that are left out of this movie proclaiming itself as 'The Bible' are too numerous to mention. I have to ask myself, is the heart of the bible still there, is the real message coming out....I feel that it is not. I feel that there is not enough pointing to our need for God. I was shocked at the lack of importance given to the passover. It seemed almost as an after thought thrown in at the last minute. So much in the Old testament points directly at Christ, and when you change or take away from it, that arrow starts to point elsewhere. Usually it ends up pointing at man.

2 Timothy 4:3-4 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, 4 and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.

Be wary, be watchful, always practice discernment.
Bless and honor God, that He may bless and honor you

Brief glimpses without effective summarization is what you come to expect from this show. The moral lessons of the stories are almost lost completely, replaced by witless character actors in contrived conversations. Other times biblical accounts are completely contradicted and it's not clear why - as the original story could have been told in the same time and format.

Which was surprising to me as I knew every story here by heart and really had no desire to hear it all again.

So...I flicked to the first episode(totally forgetting it was on)and ended up watching it. And I was hooked from there on. The acting wasn't bad, and the stories were told in an engaging manner. It had a nice flow to it and it also had good transitions to each separate story. The whole production was well done. There were some cheesy acting moments as well as some cheap looking special effects, but that is to be expected with a television production, and that didn't distract from the show's entertainment value.

No doubt with the popularity of this series and the excellent ""Vikings"" there will be similar shows made like it in the future--religious and non-religious. I'd like to see a series devoted to the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. Has that been done before in this mini-series kind of format?

5456955,4,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible is a remarkable miniseries well worth the money. It brings to life in a contemporary way scenes and major themes from the Biblical accounts in the Old and New Testament. Both Christian and nonChristian can discover the essence of the biblical account. The presence of the miraculous in the ministry of Jesus and the early church is a well relief from rationalist who would erase this from historical records (even Josephus and the Qu'ran mention the miraculous in the ministry of Jesus). The brothers and sisters of Jesus are absent (as per Roman Catholic dogma). This is unfortunate. Also the Pentecostal scene is rather unremarkable and could have been tremedously improved. Using the name Paul all the time instead of saying SAUL at the beginning and later Paul was experienced by this viewer perhaps others would agree. All in all, some of the best biblical scenes come out in the miniseries. The unforgetable call of Matthew, the tax collector and the healing miracles-Praise God for the minstry of Jesus. Churches that underreport and underproclaim the Christ who saves and heals would be wise to rethink their positions. Christ is alive! The message of Easter.",1365984000,,1177,5.010204081632653

5456961,2,B00AMR5FGA,"I'm not a new believer. I was brought up with the Bible. Yes, I do believe it. I have seen plenty of biblical movies (The Ten Commandments, Passion of the Christ, Jacob, Joseph, Ester, Abraham, etc) and have never felt more uncomfortable watching a movie than I did when I watched The Bible. I watched the mini series felt uncomfortable knowing how much they had changed each individual story from the actual story. Yes, sometimes we don't know how things went on and it's the directors job to fill in those gaps--but the problem is, he filled in gaps that didn't need to be filled in or changed.

Ninja Angels in Sodom? What?!

An obvious example is from Abraham and the sacrifice of his son, Isaac. Why not say what God asked him to do to Isaac? Why did Isaac resist? Isaac understood what was happening and REQUESTED to be tied in case he didn't have the strength. It was Isaac that helped his father, Abraham, through the process. What they showed was attempted murder of Isaac which never happened in the bible.

Another obvious example is the story of Moses. Moses was given back to his mother for safe keeping for several years. Only he and his mother knew that he was Hebrew. Also, Pharaoh did in the sea when giving chase to Moses and the Israelite people. He didn't survive.

And the mixed ethnic diversity of the cast was just ridiculous. It's the middle east. When was the last time you saw an Asian or a black and white man there? I'm sure there were a few black figures that MAY have migrated up, but I doubt it. Asian? Not for a few years yet. White? You're a long way from home there!

I feel bad that those who don't know the bible watched this and got the wrong impression of the ACTUAL events of each story. I have heard that it was created to introduce people into the bible. Because of that, I can forgive a little bit. But there is just way too much blatant false information shown that it's unforgivable that they didn't do a more accurate job.

I'm happy that many people liked it, but sad that they didn't check the stories out themselves to see if it was correct. Always do your own research!",1365897600,11,2118,4.404092071611253

I will be returning this, and wait for the full series to be released.",1365897600,,348,4.028985507246377
5456967,2,B00AMR5FGA,"Anyone buying this video hoping it is accurately portrayed will be sorely disappointed.  Facts and accounts are in my opinion deliberately left out of the movie just to gloss over important points, mainly the existence of God and his dealings with his people.

Example: Nearly everyone knows the account of Moses, yet extremely important details were left out of the story such as:

1. When Moses was exiled from Egypt, little is discussed regarding his journey to Mount Sinai and how he was told to take his shoes off because the ground was holy.  Also in this segment there was little discussed in such a way to understand that God was commissioning Moses to to God's Work in bringing the people out of the land.

2. Moses goes to Egypt and the initial meeting where Aaron casts down the staff which turns into the serpent and swallows up Pharaoh's serpents is left out of the entire story.

3. Next comes the miracle of turning the water red with blood.  This version depicts a Moses unwilling or unable to confront Pharaoh in letting the people go and helping this king to understand that it is the God of Moses who is in charge of these plagues being caused.  All you ever see during the remainder of the plagues is Pharaoh yelling ""No"" repeatedly as if Moses had appeared to him each and every time while the viewer is to wonder why since Moses never goes into the court for the duration of the story until the last plague is unleashed whereupon Moses is driven into the court like a slave rather than a noble Prophet adorned with the power of God and at this time, the people are released.

4. I can understand this story was done on a budget, but with the technology of today with CGI etc. you would think that the exodus of the people would have been done on a much grander scale.  You see what appears to be about 250 people with scantily clad wagons and only a few animals leaving Egypt.  The Bible says they took the spoils of Egypt with them along with provisions which was expected to last for the duration of a lengthy journey.  From this moment on, the viewer is left scratching his/her head as to why the producers and directors felt it necessary to rush the following scenes in order to get it over with.  No mention of the Pillar of Fire to prevent Pharaoh from catching up with them was ever brought into the picture.  Likewise, when Moses parts the waters, everyone was told to ""Hurry...Hurry"" which is exactly my point.  Why hurry and leave out the important details which Christians have come to know and expect in a religious depiction.

I could relate much more, but in short, I was sorely disappointed with this version.  I would advise anyone interested in discovering the God of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Issac, Jacob and Jesus look at some of the classic movies which are available.  Obviously this Miniseries never received advisement from any major religion who professes God and Christ as their centerpiece; rather it looks like someone who adheres to Darwinism or Scientology took the reigns on this project and glossed over the reasons why we have this precious book to learn from, particularly when it comes to learning who we need to turn to and trust in each and every day of our lives.",1365897600,,3218,4.56695652173913
5456968,5,B00AMR5FGA,this is right from the bible from start to finish it is a great companion to reading the bible and getting to understand how things were in those days,1365811200,,150,4.206896551724138
5456969,2,B00AMR5FGA,"This production had SO much potential. If they had just held true to all the facts of each story, it would have been an amazing piece of work, but for some reason, someone along the line decided that the facts must be changed to make the story more appealing. I strongly disagree. I understand trying to tell these Biblical stories is a difficult task, and sometimes, things need to be added to help the story along for cinematic reasons, but in my opinion, they changed too much. Sarah wasn't near the mountain when Abraham went up on Mount Moriah with Isaac, and we need some 'back story' on Abraham. It appears that out of the blue, God demands he sacrifice his son with no apparent reason. It really makes God look bad. There were ways to tell that story to have it make sense, stay true to the Biblical narrative AND be cinematically appealing.
Also, Moses at the burning bush was completely changed. It has a very confident Moses saying, ""With your power, I will set my people free."" That's crazy. That's not how it went. Moses was timid and unsure of himself. God had to pretty much push him to go.
Anyway, I'm not sure why Mark Burnett's team decided those types of omissions were ""in the spirit"" of the Bible, but in my opinion, they are not.
I gave it two stars because I don't hate it, but I don't love it either.
I congratulate Mark Burnett and his wife Roma for desiring to tell these amazing Biblical stories, however, I think they would have accomplished a lot more had they not strayed so far from the actual facts of how the stories are written in the Bible.",1365811200,7,1575,4.43448275862069

The main reason for my disappointment was that it did not exactly follow the Bible.  For those who have never read the Bible I would recommend this film as a place to start, but with the idea of following along by actually READING the Bible as you go.  For those like me who have read and studied the Bible more extensively, you will probably recognize the discrepancies, and that tends to detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.  My hope is that later episodes will follow Scripture more closely, but in all truth, there are other films I'd rather watch before I have another go at this one.",1365811200,,756,4.371428571428571

5456983,3,B00AMR5FGA,"I was really looking forward to watching this miniseries, especially after hearing of positive reviews (pre-release).  It is rare for a Hollywood-style biblical production to be made, although I'm betting that we will see more of such productions now that this miniseries has garnered hundreds of millions of viewers.

After watching the first segment, I debated whether to continue watching.  It was so shallow in its treatment of the subject matter, and the Hollywood style slo-mo Ninja-style angels destroying the people of Sodom had me rolling my eyes. Works well in the Matrix, not the Bible.

The acting was mediocre in all parts.  I did not become emotionally involved with a single character in this epic - not even Jesus.  And while Roma Downey and her husband's efforts to produce this series is laudable, her portrayal of Mary was disappointing. It could have been much better cast.

The stories were not all biblically accurate, but they were 'true to the spirit and intent' of the Bible (or whatever that disclaimer stated at the beginning of each episode). While the special effects were certainly close to state of the art, I would have rather they spent the money on better actors.

For what this miniseries was intended to do (give a broad range of people a glimpse into the Bible), it was highly successful, and if viewership was the sole criterion for a rating, it would get 5 stars.  However, I must rate it three stars, as it left me feeling empty.

To those of you for whom this was the first television exposure to biblical material, I highly recommend that if you would like to see a much better portrayal of New Testament events and the life of Jesus, please consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-of-Nazareth/dp/B0000633QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus of Nazareth</a>.

5456986,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Hollywood and the powers that be have a problem with dispelling the truth. Apparently, before the lack of truth is told in this miniseries, it starts out by saying that they have told the story according to biblical accounts, which if they had told the story according to biblical accounts, Jesus would not look like Brad Pitt, and Noah would not have an Irish accent. Such foolishness. They meagerly attempt to interpose truth in the mix with the figure Samson. For Samson was a Nazorean, who took the Nazorean vow. If anyone knows who the ancient Nazorean/Hebrews were, they would understand that their physical appearance is what most people today would describe as African or African-American looking. Yeshua or Jesus, was also from Nazareth, and also took the Nazorean vow to not lift a shear to his hair or beard. He had hair like lambs wool, skin like brass burnt in an oven( anyone who has burnt brass in an oven knows it is black, not brown, or white or ""light-skinned""). He had eyes red like flaming fire. If you wish to find someone who looks like this, one doesn't have to travel very far. The many African men or African-American men you see on a daily basis with ""dreadlocks"", most likely represent what the ancient Jesus and Sampson most closely resembles.

They also changed the story of Moses, The Pharoah and Ramseys didn't know Moses wasn't an Egyptian.

If I could ask Miss Downey, one question, and that's all, I would want to ask. It would be...""what was this hideous adaptation, based on. Oh sure, they referenced, biblical personages, and that's as far as they got. If one is merely looking for entertainment...maybe. But for anyone who knows scriptures? This series is beyond ""sacrilege."" I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, under any circumstances. I was trying to recall some ""actual"" occurrences, from The Bible, the Holy Book, and the series, of the same name. Pardon my departure from the King's English, but, ""there ain't nairn."" I imagine Miss Downey, and company, had good intentions...but I've heard it told, ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions."" This entire series was a mockery, of ""the word of GOD."" If they're not ashamed? They just oughta be. I wish I could ask Miss Downey, one question. Just one. That would be, ""what bible is this from?!? I don't say it ""doesn't exist;"" It's just The Bible I am familiar with. And no one else on the planet, who has ever ""read,"" The Bible. I've called a number of friends, asking them ""would they like to have this series?"" So far? No takers. And anyone who reveres ""the WORD of The LORD,"" would even think of doing so.

I'm not judging just stating my opinion like others do all the time. I don't have the right or authority to judge other's. This is a very well made miniseries about the Bible. God did not right the Bible, but only the 10 commandments set in stone is how we should live our lives and treat others (loved one's and enemies) with love and accept all with open arms. Who cares if this miniseries is not Totally Accurate. In order to understand the Bible, you must first understand where it came from and who wrote the Bible. A human had wrote the Bible 125 years after Jesus death, which another human that was illiterate and could not write well had rewritten the original testament of the Bible and so forth by other's who could not write well and did not understand the meaning of each other's mistake. The Bible as of right now only tells the stories that had been rewritten 5700 times and interpreted in majority languages.

After watching Mel Gibson's The Passion every Jesus scenes look like amateur work. I mean if they whipped Jesus in those days like they did He would not have just little scars on his body. He would look more like Jim Caviezel's version. Now they're calling Diogo Morgado the ""Hot Jesus"". Come on! Be serious! If this is a serious work about a serious matter it should be treated as such. Ou generation of people in their 30's and 40's could never watch scenes like Moses parting of the Red Sea and not thinking of The Ten Commandments and Charlton Heston or The Prince of Egypt and the CGI scene.

I think any product that comes out relating to the bible is a good thing (considering the Government took God out of schools and are trying to encourage homosexuality). I've read all the reviews from 1 to 5 stars. You low star people can't expect a book of life to be made in 10 hours...If you want to be typical, the book of Genesis couldn't even been made in 10 hours! But they did what they could. Quite honestly, My wife and I would watch a series, with the bible in hand and locate that particular series. It was fun, it follows the book, it makes you want to learn more.

5457023,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I'd have to give this product a ""B"" for ""Nice Effort."" Having read the Bible many, many times, some of the errors/slights adopted by the filmmakers in ""keeping to the spirit of the book"" were kind of large. I kept getting the feeling that the budget was set, and what we ended up seeing was a collection of Bible stories created ""under budget and right on time."" Sets all looked surprisingly similar. Jericho resembled Jerusalem, which resembled Babylon, etc. etc. All scenes filmed on city streets were nearly identical, and I could almost hear the director calling to the set supervisor to ""Add the latticework to the windows! We're going to film a courtyard scene now!"" Pharaoh's throne room bore a strong resemblance to the throne room of Saul/David, which looked eerily similar to Nebuchanezzar's. Specific and separate Bible stories that took place many years apart were depicted as dovetailing into each other, so that the ""3 Men in the Fiery Furnace"" story happened just a short time before ""Daniel in the Lion's Den.""

The cast seemed to be quite budget-driven as well. Instead of seeing Moses leading 600,000 people through the Red Sea (a number that could have easily been CGI'ed), what we actually saw was Moses leading what looked to be his high school graduating class between the raging walls of water. Saul's army also looked cut-rate, and all of the crowd scenes were looking not particularly crowded.

Props, though, for revealing some of the lesser-known Bible stories like ""The Spies and Rahab,"" ""Saul's Pursuit of David,"" and ""The Babylonian Captivity,"" though some historical as well as Biblical liberties were taken with the words of Scripture, once again in the interest of tim-compression.

I would like to see these filmmakers produce an entire series of Bible stories based on events as depicted in the Bible. Maybe with a larger budget to hire a larger cast and do more individual work on the sets, this team committed to bringing us The Bible in its truth could have the liberty to strive for more believable accuracy.",1365465600,,2047,4.910404624277457

5457031,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I was sadly disappointed.  I thought Roma Downey, having played in the series ""Touched By An Angel,"" would know much more about the Bible, I thought wrong....
I'm not sure who Roma & her husband consulted with on their version, but its obvious Satan was truly in the mix, as the lies about the story of the Bible were more enter woven in the story, & the truth was not in the story.  Thing of it is, they didn't have to consult anyone (unless they needed financial support) because the Bible's accuracy speaks for it self.
  Roma & husband butchered this 10 hour mini-mistake version from beginning to end, that I doubt anyone could get saved from watching it...  There is so much non-truth that you could call this a fictional story of the Bible, so fictional that it becomes a lie. Therefore, anyone who is not a Christian will either believe the lie, or laugh how ridiculous it is.
  Like when Jesus arrived after 4 days to call Lazarus from the tomb & that Jesus - our Savior - kissed him on the forehead & told him to get up, & his sister was in the tomb with Jesus.
  John 11:23 -26 says, Jesus said to her [Martha], ""Your brother will rise again.""  Martha answered, ""I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.""  Jesus said, ""I am the resurrection and the life.  He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives & believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this.?"" Then vs 41 says, So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up & said, ""Father, I thank you that you have heard Me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that You [God the Father] sent Me [Jesus the Son of God]. Vs 43: When He had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, ""Lazarus, come out!"" The dead man came out, his hand & feet wrapped with strips of linen, & a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, ""Take off the grave clothes & let him go.""
  Now that's what happened.... But if you didn't understand the last sentence, Jesus is telling the family to take off his grave cloths for obvious reasons; but He was also telling the demon of death to ""let him go.""
At any rate, I do hope & pray that you read all of the book of John & investigate the rest of what this mini-mistake is telling you so that you will know the truth; because John 8:32 says, ""Then you will know the truth , & the truth will set you free.""
  And lastly Hosea 4:6 states, ""My people are destroyed [will perish] from lack of knowledge."" Which is knowledge about what the Bible or the Word of God says is true, not what the world [Satan is the prince of this world] says is right.
  God Bless those who take this to heart & search the scriptures for themselves & develop their relationship with God the Father, Jesus the Son of God & the Holy Spirit....",1365379200,18,2798,4.227443609022556

5457046,5,B00AMR5FGA,This series is a must have for Christians and those who are interested in Christianity. A truly remarkable achievement by the producers. I learn something new every time I watch it.,1365379200,,181,4.870967741935484
5457047,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Arrived on time and in great shape. Exactly what I was looking for, couldn't have asked for better. Blah Blah.",1365379200,,110,4.55
5457048,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Just got the this and sat down with the family to watch.  By Abraham story I realized there were parts missing.  I can't believe that I waited this whole time and it is a watered down version of the tv series. Just one Example below.

Spoiler:
Example:  When Lot is captured and Abraham rescues him.  In the bluray after the battle Abraham goes to Lot and says ""let's stick together as a family""  the Lot says ""no uncle, we move on to Sodom"".  Abraham then out of nowhere gives a strange look to Lot's wife and then tells his men ""we are leaving"".  All of this didn't fit together well.
Now,  in the actual TV version,  after Abraham says ""let's stick together""  Lot says ""no""  then Abraham says ""but we sacraficed so many of our men to save you"".  Then Lot says ""we lost many men as well.  We must move on to Sodom"".  Then Lot's wife says ""the city is where we need to be.  Come with us!""  Abraham then gives her the strange look I was talking about.
The TV version made so much more sense!  What is going on?  Who knows what other parts are cut out from the TV version?? Never seen anything like this.

I am returning this and calling the company who made it.  What a disappointment!!  Did they think we wouldn't notice!?",1365292800,330,1223,4.248908296943231
5457049,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I have always enjoyed biblical drama, so when I heard about History Channel's The Bible: The Epic Miniseries (2013), I was anxious to watch it. I watched the first episode on YouTube, but it kept stopping, so when I found out that the story about Moses from Exodus was available to view around Passover, I wanted to see it. I ended up buying that episode for my Kindle Fire, but bought the whole series on DVD too.

The story of Moses and the Exodus was excellent.  It was very accurate and well done.

Seeing the series reminds me of reading the Bible in comic book form.  Many stories are covered and some scripture is said, and the stories are easy to understand.

Most of the reviews I've read say that this series is very good. I agree, but there are some things I don't like:

Many stories are skipped over, including the story of Joseph.  All that is said is that ""famine brought the Israelites to Egypt.""  To me that is ""so weird.""  People that have never read the Bible will never know about Joseph since the series skipped over it.

Everyone in the series speaks with a perfect ""English accent.""  I guess British actors were used in the series, but it is again ""just plain weird"" to see biblical characters speaking ""perfect English.""

The ""Bad Guys"" are really ugly and evil looking and life in biblical times appears to be very, very miserable.  The ""bad guys"" in the series have greasy hair and dark dirty faces and look like they need baths.  I guess the producers of this series wanted to be realistic about what life was like.  Watching the series made me glad I was not born in biblical times.

The ""Devil"" in the series seems to look a lot like President Barack Obama.  That too, is just ""plain weird"" and seems a bit odd.

Almost every scene takes place in the desert.  The sets look similar to Tatooine, the desert planet, from the Stars Wars Episode One movie and the angels and the devil also seem to be dressed up as Jedi or Sith like in Star Wars.  Not all of Israel is a desert and not all the stories from the Bible should resemble Star Wars.

The actor who played Samson is black and one of the angels who went Sodom is Asian.  Various races may have existed in biblical times, but I don't believe Samson was black.  I guess angels could be Asian...but why does the angel look like he's ninja warrior fighting in a kids' fantasy movie?

I am glad I bought the DVDs.  I was surprised how many bible stories I do know.  I will watch the series with my family again and again.",1365292800,,2500,4.368763557483731

5457051,2,B00AMR5FGA,we do not have all the stories previewed in each DVD.Some of the main stories are not there. Maybe paying only 20 something dollars instead of the 50 everywhere else has something to do with it.,1365292800,,194,4.416666666666667
5457052,1,B00AMR5FGA,I tried to load it to my dvd play or my labtop and still not working I hate to send it back reason being I love to have it in my collections but I have to try to buy it again once the return is clear.,1365292800,2,200,3.369565217391304
5457053,4,B00AMR5FGA,I can't say much about the Bible miniseries as I just started to watch them. I do read the bible and so far things seem to be on target with what I read in the bible. I have told others that they should get the DVD's abd check it out for themselves. So far I really liike it.,1365292800,,275,3.7586206896551726
5457054,2,B00AMR5FGA,I bought this for my mom because she saw the whole thing on the history channel and they cut a lot of parts from the original show. There are too many parts missing.,1365292800,,165,4.03030303030303
5457055,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I have a very intimate understanding with the Bible and close relationship with God. I enjoy reading and studying my Bible everyday! I love a good discussion (whether opposing thoughts are exchanged or they are the same). My husband and I have watched this series from the beginning with our children. From the first episode, we would pause the series and talk about the parts that were left out. We would follow along in our Bibles and really talk about everything.

There were things in this miniseries that I actually forgot about until we paused and talked about it. One of the scenes that we paused and talked about for example, was where the Wisemen were at the stable when Jesus was born. We know that they didn't see Jesus until He was around 2 years old, but we do know the significance in the Wisemen and Jesus' birth, so I'm glad they included them. (I mean they are included in every nativity set, so no one should complain about this). Another part, more recently, was when they stuck the spear in Jesus' side after He died on the cross. Water and blood rushed out (as it states in John), but in the movie it didn't. -->Again, not a crucial component to knowing who God is! The message is still there.

These parts left out or changed a bit, didn't make our enjoyment of the series any less rewarding. We know, without a doubt, that the Bible is the ONLY true, inherent Word of God! Any movie, no matter how much the producers and actors love God, will never be close to that same category!!! We (people) are made in the likeness of God -imitators of God- and we can't go one day without wondering away (whether in our minds, hearts, actions or words). I think the miniseries was very good and think the producers and actors did an amazing job!

As with any movie or show (whether Christian or not) it is always good to talk about what is going on and I highly encourage it, but even if you didn't, there is nothing in this miniseries that I would warn anyone about. Everything that requires us to be in Heaven is in this miniseries. They did not mess up who God is!!!!! I would recommend this miniseries to everyone who is interested in seeing a movie that puts a little bit of the book to life. It is amazing! A huge plus...11.7 million people watched the last episode! Think about how many unsaved brothers and sisters this miniseries may have reached!  God be the glory in everything! Take this miniseries for what it was intended to be - a good wholesome film for the family! As always, the book is WAY better :) :) :)",1365292800,,2536,4.423982869379015

5457059,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The miniseries was fun to watch. It didn't have all my favorite histories played out, but there is a lot of ground to cover when going from genius is to revelation in only ten hours. Very much worth your time and money. May even have a few interesting revelations for those of us raised on the old stories in the Bible.",1365292800,,319,4.245901639344262
5457060,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I've been reading through the reviews both good and bad and it seems like the people who gave the bad reviews missed the point of the movie. I see a lot of complaints about british accents, ninja angels, and other ""agendas"". To me, this was to show that God loved us so that he sent his done to die for our transgressions. And that is exactly what needed to be portrayed in the sin sick work. There was only one person to never sin and to judge someone and come off haughty and self righteous is a sin in itself. The majority of this series was the new testament and the is the good news that needs to be taught. Salvation isn't earned, it has been given to us by or Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who died so that we may live. A saint is just a sinner who fell down and got back up. People who sin need prayer, not condemnation. God bless.",1365292800,2,838,4.084848484848485

5457062,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Airing on the History Channel, this expansive 10-part miniseries brings some of the most fascinating events from both the Old and New Testaments to breathtaking life. Among the stories told are Noah's Ark, the Exodus, Daniel in the Lion's Den, the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and more. Great scenes and acting. Nerrator is great in this version. Watched it as it aired on the history channel, I had to have it for home. I highly recommend it.",1365206400,,462,4.7875
5457063,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Absolutely beautiful. Very well done. The Actors, the script., it was all so perfect!
It brought me back in touch with my humanity as well as my spiritual nature.
I was very humbled and took inventory of my own behavior.
I am reminded of my own history as a Christian.
And who my Savior, and Creator are, and how much I am loved.

I didn't like all the violence but I fast forward over all that.",1365206400,,353,4.53125

5457070,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The Bible is an amazing mini-series! It's ridiculous to criticize it because it doesn't cover the ENTIRE Bible... it's only a 10 hr series! Covering the ENTIRE Bible was never the point.  It's an overview of the ENTIRE Bible -- but what they do cover is totally amazing. The stories of Abraham, Daniel, Samson are amazing. The stories of Moses and David are also well done. The portrayal of Jesus can't be easy for any actor -- how do you play the son of God? -- But the portrayal in this series is beautiful. It makes you feel the love of God -- and  isn't THAT the point? :-) The point is not to fight  about why these words were said in this scene and not that scene or fighting about why something was left out --- some of the people giving this series a bad review are REALLY missing the forest for the trees....  .... just soak in the love of our Lord and Savior! See the Bible come to life before your eyes!

PS: I must give a ""shout out"" to some of the actors who had small parts but did an AMAZING job with them... The man who played the Wise man at Jesus's birth -- awesome! The man who played Simon of Cyrene (he helped Jesus carry the cross) Incredible! -- and the man who played Cornelius (he summoned Peter to show him how to receive forgiveness of sin for himself and his household)- loved, loved, loved his performance!",1365120000,4,1335,4.260869565217392

5457076,5,B00AMR5FGA,This was by far the best I have ever seen regarding The Bible stories. I highly recommend. The actors were amazing.,1365120000,,115,4.523809523809524
5457077,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I watched all five episodes and enjoyed them all. They stick to the heart of the message (trust in God, work towards the Promised Land, love and forgiveness, etc) in a truly awesome manner. For example, the line Moses says to Pharaoh as God's people are crossing the Red Sea. ""You're not a god. There is only one god....and He is with us."" Moses might not have said EXACTLY that in the Bible but it is the spirit of the scene and it's a badass boast worthy of any action movie.

There's lots of other cool stuff in the Old Testament: Samson and his massacre with the donkey's jaw bone, Joshua's conquest of Jerico, etc but the message is always prominent. It doesn't get buried in ""Hollywood"" action or drama etc. ""God is with you. Trust in Him and He will help you.""

The New Testament is also great. Jesus is portrayed as humble and compassionate and wise and authoritive. The scene where he converts Matthew is breathtaking. I was afarid the 'chasing out the money lenders' scene would be cut for being too violent or whatever but no, it's here. The producers don't flinch away from it. Jesus looks around then overturns the tables and calls the people out for turning a 'house of prayer' into a 'den of thieves'.

I don't understand why the 1 star reviewers are so mad. To cover every event in the Bible in full detail would have taken all year. I was disappointed that parts of Samson's story were left out (the lion scene and the following riddle, for instance) but Samson lived for decades. His life could be a mini-series in and off itself. They must belong to the They Changed It Now It Sucks crowd. They should be happy that so many people have heard the Good News.",1365120000,3,1675,4.449511400651466

5457079,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This dvd collection is awesome. I would recommend this to every age group beyond 13 years old and older due to the violence activity in this series. I like this collection so much because it puts the words of the bible into a visual perspective. Since our society is so much into video media and the younger population or newly believer may have issues of imagining what the stories/word of the bible is about when reading it, this dvd collection is a great inhabitor. This is so much better than all the reality tv that is out there. Please consider purchasing or viewing this as a family or sharing with a friend, neighbor, or totally stranger. No dislikes about this product at all. Just wishing for more products like it. Thank you amazon for a great price also compared to the current market price of 40 to 50 percent more.

5457084,4,B00AMR5FGA,This is an amazing mini-series! Although they left out God's name I am so impressed by what they have done. Never before have they taken bible accounts and presented it like this and with a multi-racial cast which is closer to the true depiction of what people really looked like during that time period. After watching this series I seriously feel inspired and at peace. When you see what God has done you know that there is nothing he won't do for those who ask and come with a pure heart.

5457087,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Hello all!

I have enjoyed watching The Bible: The Epic Miniseries and believe that it is a great series that is definitely worth buying. I'm not going to give a substantial review of the miniseries at this time, instead, the only disappointment that I experienced when receiving the Blu-ray version of The Bible was that it didn't come with an insert listing which episodes are on each disk and what the episodes are about. It only lists this information at the main menu of each disc. I have copied the text describing each part (parts 1-5 as aired on television) from the History Channel's website along with each episodes' description as given at the menu of each disc. From this I was able to put together a contents insert to keep with the series so that I'll know which episodes are on each disc and what they are about.

I listed all of this information here in case if anyone else is interested in having this as well. You may even want to just omit the part descriptions as the videos only come in episodes. Please note that all of the information pertaining to the part and episode descriptions were written by the creators of The Bible: The Epic Miniseries and all rights belong to them (Downey & Burnett, 2013). It is my hope that God will bless many lives through this series. Enjoy!

THE BIBLE

Disc 1: Episodes 1, 2, and 3
Disc 2: Episodes 4, 5, and 6
Disc 3: Episodes 7, 8, and 9
Disc 4: Episode 10 and Extra Features

Part 1: Beginnings (Episodes 1 & 2)
Noah endures God's wrath; Abraham reaches the Promised Land but still must prove his faith in God; Moses leads the Israelites out of Egypt, and his faith in God is rewarded when the Red Sea parts to allow the Israelites to escape Pharaoh's chariots; Moses delivers his final message from God-the Ten Commandments.

Episode 1: In the Beginning
After the Great Flood, a new chapter in God's relationship with man begins. Abraham is chosen by God to lead his people to the Promised Land and is assured descendants as numerous as the stars, but God tests his faith again and again. Generations later, famine drives Abraham's descendents - the Israelites - into Egypt where they are enslaved by the pharaoh.

Episode 2: Exodus
While in exile, Moses is told by God at the Burning Bush that he will free the Israelites from slavery. Moses returns to Egypt and, with the help of ten devastating plagues and the miracle of the parting of the Red Sea, he leads the Israelites to freedom. At Mount Sinai, Moses receives laws from God that will prepare the Israelites for life in a new land.

Part 2: Homeland (Episodes 3 & 4)
Joshua conquers Jericho; Delilah betrays Samson as the Israelites battle the Philistines; Samuel anoints David as king, a move that could throw the nation into civil war; Saul is consumed with jealousy when David defeats Goliath; King David ushers in a golden age for Israel, but is soon seduced by power and lust for Bathsheba; God forgives David, and his son, Solomon, builds God's temple in Jerusalem.

Episode 3: Homeland
The Israelites are ready to begin a new life in a new land and, when the walls of Jericho miraculously collapse, they are finally able to gain a foothold in Canaan. At first, the Israelites face numerous foreign invaders when they disobey God. The Philistines eventually rule over them until God endows Samson with the physical strength to fight back. The Phillistines maintain the upper hand, so the Israelites demand a king to lead them in battle. Reluctantly, the prophet Samuel makes Saul king.

Episode 4: Kingdom
King Saul and the Israelite army face seemingly impossible odds against the Philistine army and their champion, Goliath. An unlikely hero, the young David, defeats Goliath and goes on to lead the Israelites to victory against the Philistines. Saul fears that David means to steal his throne and so betrays his loyal warrior. This is Saul's undoing, and David becomes king and later captures Jerusalem for the Israelites.

Part 3: Hope (Episodes 5 & 6)
The Jews are enslaved in Babylon; Daniel is thrown into the lions' den, but when his faith endures and God spares him, the Jews are allowed to return to Jerusalem; the Angel Gabriel tells Mary she will bear a child; Joseph takes Mary to Bethlehem for the census, where Jesus is born; the Holy family escapes Herod's order to kill Bethlehem's male babies; Judea comes under the ruthless rule of Pilate; John baptizes Jesus, who is now ready to take on his mission-and his revolution.

Episode 5: Survival
Nearly four hundred years after the rule of David, Babylonian hordes lay siege to Jerusalem and force the Jews into exile in Babylon, where their identity and faith are tested. Decades later, Cyrus, King of Persia, conquers Babylon. Fulfilling biblical prophecy, Cyrus begins to allow the Jews to return to their homeland.

Episode 6: Hope
Against a backdrop of Roman oppression, young Mary's faith is rewarded when the angel Gabriel tells her she will carry a special child from God. Jesus is born to Mary and Joseph and, from the outset, his life is in danger. But with guidance from his parents and his baptism by John, he is strong enough to take on even Satan.

Part 4: Mission (Episodes 7 & 8)
Jesus feeds the crowds in Galilee and brings a dead man, Lazarus, back to life; Jesus enters Jerusalem riding on a donkey-a declaration that he is the Messiah; Jesus turns on the money-changers in the Temple; Caiphas coaxes Judas into betraying Jesus; Jesus throws the disciples into turmoil at the Last Supper; Jesus is arrested and condemned to death as the disciples scatter.

Episode 7: Mission
Jesus and his disciples move from town to town preaching love and forgiveness, but this radical approach is not welcomed by everyone. Jesus' miracles grow increasingly wondrous until he conquers death itself, raising Lazarus from the tomb.

Episode 8: Betrayal
Jesus arrives in Jerusalem, openly declaring that he is the promised Messiah. High Priest Caiaphas fears that impassioned crowds will start a riot, so he finds a way to get to Jesus - through Judas. At the Last Supper, Jesus tells his disciples that one of them will betray him. They can only watch as Jesus is arrested and led away.

Part 5: Passion (Episodes 9 & 10)
Peter denies Jesus and Judas hangs himself; the crowd clamors for Jesus's death; Jesus is crucified, but when Mary Magdalene goes to his tomb, a figure walks towards her-he is back; Jesus commissions the disciples to ""go and preach to all creation,"" but their godly mission meets with hatred and even death; Paul has a vision and experiences a miraculous change of faith on a journey to Damascus; John receives a revelation-Jesus is coming back, and all who keep the faith will be rewarded.

Episode 9: Passion
Jesus is sentenced to die by crucifixion. The crowds of Jerusalem wail as Jesus is forced to drag his cross to Golgotha, where he is crucified for all to see. As life leaves his body, the sky darkens and the earth quakes. His mother weeps.

Episode 10: Courage
Mary Magdalene thinks she has gone mad when she finds Jesus' tomb empty, but then Jesus appears. The resurrected Jesus delivers his final message to his disciples before he leaves them to continue without him, but promises that, in the Spirit, he will be with them always.

I cannot express my gratitude for the creation of this series.  I promise, it will not disappoint.  Of course, I would have liked to have seen all of the Bible presented, including Jonah and the whale and Jesus as a child working with Joseph the carpenter, but no single series will ever encompass every detail of the Book.

5457094,4,B00AMR5FGA,"We liked the mini series, it was following the Bible for the most part, kinda skims over things that have already been done in the past.  The only thing we didn't like, was the hollywood gore.  It seemed like they picked verses of the bible just because they got to add another battle scene.  I didn't really see why the capture of Lot and his family before they reached Sodom was so important, except to add more fighting.  The New Testament isn't quite as bad as the old, but there is still, in my opinion, unnecessary blood and guts.  It is enjoyable, and I am glad that we have it to add to the collection of other Bible books and movies we have.  I would buy it again, and definitely recommend it with reservations.",1364947200,3,720,4.335820895522388

Powerful.  Even someone who doesn't believe can learn from the teachings of that man called ""Jesus"".

5457096,4,B00AMR5FGA,"If it were a motion picture, The Bible would have to be rated at least PG-13 for the incredible amount of graphic violence it depicts. The cameras capture throat slitting, beheadings, stonings, beatings, and the same kind of sword slashing, stabbing and hacking (with splattering blood) that we got from a movie like 300.

That's the first thing that strikes you about this series. The second is that the production values, the casting, the writing--even the segues that help span huge chunks of the book that had to be omitted--are all quite good. The CGI effects are terrific in this big-screen quality production. In fact, the only thing that reminds you it's television are annoying ""Previously on"" and ""Next on"" montages that bookend each episode and run excessively long. But at least you can skip over those.

Abraham's story is included, as is the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt, Joshua and the fall of Jericho, Samson and Delilah, King Saul, David and Goliath and David's reign, the Babylonian captivity with Daniel in the Lion's Den and the three men in the fiery furnace, and the more familiar territory of the New Testament: the story of Jesus' birth, miracle-working, disciple-gathering, teachings, and eventual betrayal and crucifixion. Filmmakers Roma Downey and Mark Burnett are to be commended for continuing the story beyond that, with Jesus' disciples trying to spread the gospel and Saul becoming Paul, the great converter of gentiles. It's a much more satisfying ending than if everything stopped at the cross.

There are some interesting choices made throughout. Rastafarians always said that Samson wore dreads, and he does so here. Herod is a corpulent gourmand, while Jesus (played by Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado) is the long-haired beatific messiah that everyone envisions--but he's as believable a Jesus as I've seen in a film or television production. But I wasn't impressed by the addition of physical soldiers dressed in armor and cloaks who were shown every time God was speaking, or who brought God's message. It was the only hokey element in an otherwise solidly conceived production.

Younger children and people disturbed by graphic violence won't be able to watch, but the rest of the family will find The Bible an interesting combination of the expected and unexpected.

5457097,5,B00AMR5FGA,"So here's the thing... I would call myself a 'seasonal Catholic', that is, I was baptized and attended Catholic schools and now, in my adult years, I attend church every now and then for the special occasions (weddings, Christmas, Easter, etc). After seeing the promos for this series on TV and billboards around town, I thought I'd give this series a go and watched all of it over the Easter weekend.

I can honestly say that this series has rekindled my faith in a dramatic way. Watching all episodes from start to finish brought me back to my elementary school days of learning about the Bible. Each episode was moving, emotional and very informative, with first-class acting. The series starts with the story of Noah, then Abraham, then moves through the stories of the Old Testament, before moving on to the birth of Jesus, His crucifixion and resurrection. Highlights for me included the story of Moses and the exodus from Egypt, the story of Samson, Daniel in the lions' den, Mary and Joseph's journey to Bethlehem and the nativity, the Passion, Jesus' resurrection, and the apostles' later role in early Christianity (the section on Paul was particularly interesting).

My one minor criticism is that some scenes looked a little too ""computerish"", if that makes sense. For example, panning shots of the temples and buildings looked like they were obvious CGI. Fire looks a little fake too. But these criticisms are very minor and didn't at all detract from my enjoyment of this series.

Some scenes are a little too gruesome for young children and I really think the History Channel should edit together a version appropriate for young children.. I could see it in the library of many Christian elementary schools!

All in all, a great, entertaining, uplifting and inspiring series. This high quality depiction of the Bible is long overdue and I commend the History Channel for having the guts to support this series. You can tell this series will do extremely well in DVD sales (I'm guessing many churches and schools will want copies) and syndication.

Not every movie, mini-series, or documentary is going to be great for everyone, so a few low ratings should not detract from the goodness of this one. You can't please all the people all the time.

The acting was great throughout and it seems folks are harping too much on the minutiae. I mean, are you really complaining about the accents? Do you really think the producers could have found the same amount of good actors who could all speak Aramaic?

5457108,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I've read through a number of the reviews also including many that gave this series 1 star.  I'm disappointed as others have mentioned that those rating this miniseries as low, based their opinions on minor discrepancies and stories that needed to be left out.  When you think that this was done in 10 hours with commercials, it probably has 7 hours of actual taping time which is an incredibly short amount of time to cover the entire Bible.  As I noticed parts of the Old Testament that were not covered in the miniseries (mainly the golden calf, Jacob, and Joseph), my thought was that the producers wanted to give an overview of the Old Testament but also wanted to spend as much time as possible on the New Testament and the hope that Jesus brings.  My thought is that this was a good choice and my favorite episodes were really episodes 3-5 because I thought they did a great job on the story of Daniel and then covered the New Testament.  I agree that the actor that played Jesus was phenomenal and showed Jesus' compassion but was also able to show other emotions (such as anger at the Temple and at the Pharisees for their hypocrisy) without taking away from who Jesus is.  I feel that the way the New Testament is covered in the miniseries is most important to open the eyes of non-believers to what it really means to follow Christ and I do believe this has the ability to open eyes and hearts, and to change lives.
I'm also very disappointed in the reviewers that gave 1 star who attacked the producers by saying the producers don't know Scripture and that was the reason for the inaccuracies.  We may not understand why some things didn't match exactly but to assume it was due to ignorance without really knowing is unfair.  I've heard Roma Downey and Mark Burnett talk about this miniseries and it was clear from Roma that she was called by God to make this miniseries and has a deep faith and in my opinion, did a great job of pulling it all together.  I did not feel that any of the inaccuracies or missing stories took away from the overall message.  I believe that she prayed through the series and asked God for his guidance on how to make it happen, and that the final product brings glory to God and shows the hope that comes from belief in Jesus Christ.",1364947200,4,2276,4.449519230769231

For each of the stories brought to life in each series, one can get a very good grasp of real world issues that brought about the story.  Some short cuts were made, but I would gather because of timing to get as much information about the subject(s) that were shown for 2 hours each Sunday.

As with anyone that has read the book before watching the movie, the book is always better.  This miniseries, a close second.

I was already connecting with God but this series did something that lead me back to the actual bible. I loved watching the series and looked forward to it coming on each Sunday. Now that it is no longer on I will be sad. I read and learn from the bible but there is something to be said about seeing words of the bible put in to pictures and video. I think this can reconnect most of the youths  of this generation.

Then today, after reading most of the one star reviews posted here, I was shocked at how many review ""dislike"" votes there were as opposed to the ""like"" votes posted.  Obviously many of the people that voted ""dislike"" concerning the one star reviews have not read, or have forgotten, the words in The Bible.  After reading the one star reviews and reasons for the bad reviews, I am glad I did not watch the rest of this series.  I agree with those that posted one star reviews and I liked/agree with their reasons.  I am also very disappointed with Roma and her husband.

This film has so many inaccuracies that I wouldn't even recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a film for the sake of entertainment or for just passing time.  But, if you're really interested in learning Scriptures and the Word of God or if you want to make a change in your life by accepting and following God, you'd be better off not wasting your time with this mis-leading series.  In my opinion, the 1966 version of The Bible (directed by John Huston) is a much better interpretation of Scriptures.

As a bible student for 23 years and possessing All Bible films ever made from silent films until today I can clearly say what is good and what is bad. This mniseries is fantastic to spark interest in the good Book. While the miniseries takes many dramatic license, the emotion and heart of it is clearly felt. It makes no claim to authenticity yet many scenes actually feel more authentic and not forced to look holier than thou but instead makes you think how hard those times were and thus these people did not know they would be in the bible one day. Many may mention omissions of many stories which it does skip,however it spends a great deal in Christ. Acting is excellent as well as the score. For my all my Christians brothers who criticize this series I say to you then what would you produce. Those word for word Visual Bible Videos ""Matthew, Acts, John?"" That although literal word for word and nothing more and honest, nevertheless are completely dull boring and without emotion whatsoever. Even I who know the bible and enjoy it have had a hard time getting through those videos and if i knew not the material with those productions i would turn it off. Sad but true. Those videos are for Christians and Christians alone. You say you want to reach people well with those videos Christianity would have never gotten of the ground per say. In 2004 every Christian complained about ""The Passion of the Christ"" including scenes not in the gospels or out of order yet it was so power full no one could not say they weren't moved and it reached to millions. This miniseries is great if you are curious about the Bible and and recommend it as a great start up tool.

I will say the acting was phenomenal! Especially the guy, Diogo Morgado, who played Jesus. This series definitely got me interested in reading the Bible, and really understanding the word of God! It's also a great tool for witnessing to unbelievers, because it peeks your interest and makes you have to go back in your Bible and see what was accurate and what was not in the series.

I'm just glad I'm not related to anyone who made this possible.  It blows my mind that it was done by people who KNOW better~!!!",1364860800,8,492,4.258064516129032
5457134,5,B00AMR5FGA,"We just finished watching ""The Bible"" on the History Channel and I am ordering the Blu-Ray Disc set tonight. I have read some of the reviews here. Some people compare it with the 1970's mini-series ""Jesus of Nazareth"". I remember when that series came out many Christian groups had many negative things to say about it. It was not 100% accurate to the text of the Bible. They added characters and dialogue not in the scripture. They were to lax regarding the story of the resurrection etc., etc., etc. At the time until this series on the History Channel ""Jesus of Nazareth"" has been my all time favorite biblical movie because it presented Christ very much like he is in the New Testament. I must say however that the breadth, scope, and yes emotional appeal of this new series was very strong for me. I cannot think that any biblical movie could ever please all groups. Whoever would produce a film based on the Bible would have interpret the texts to film just as an artist would interpret an image from the Bible for a painting, or sculpture, or a piece of music. Is this series 100% accurate to the Biblical texts? No. Does this series strive to be true to the spirit of the texts? YES! If you even remotely liked ""Jesus of Nazareth"" or ""The Passion of the Christ"" I would encourage you to see this series. More than any other it shows that the Bible has a single message. A message God intended to share with the world. I believe it has a very good blend of action, excitement, and faith. It is not a show suited for young children. There are some shockingly realistic violent scenes (just as there are some shockingly violent stories in the Bible). This series could be the door that invites someone to read the scriptures for themselves for the first time. In my opinion the version of Jesus depicted in this series is so far the best. I never thought another biblical movie would replace ""Jesus of Nazareth"" as my all-time favorite but I have to confess that this one has. It was never boring and was emotionally and visually arresting. For Christians I think this is a very worthwhile series to own. At least if you are reading this please give it a try (maybe rent some episodes on Amazon and see for yourself). There hasn't been a biblical series quite like this in a very long time.",1364774400,4,2295,4.492822966507177
5457135,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I would like to start to say that I grew up in church but have not attended in quite a while so hearing these stories for the first time in a long time was nice. Refreshing my memory and also teaching me a lesson was quite the practice as I watched the series. Of course the series was not able to tell every story that was in the Bible but it did cover quite a bit. The story of Jesus from birth through resurrection was powerful. I understand different people will watch this for different reasons. That being said I recommend this to anyone, especially those who maybe having a going through a difficult time or questioning things in their life. To see what Jesus walked through during his time on Earth is truly amazing and will move anyone to tears. Thank you History Channel for doing this.",1364774400,3,796,4.385135135135135
5457136,5,B00AMR5FGA,I read the NToften to keep the faith and keep my strength. I read the OT as the NT refers to the OT. Given the time constraint this series does an excellent job of conveying the spirit of the really Good Book. The Passion and the last scene with John just slayed me. I highly recommend but as any Christian knows there is virtually endless treasure in the Bible. There is so much more than a miniseries can convey.,1364774400,,414,4.253164556962025

5457138,5,B00AMR5FGA,I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT COVERED A LOT OF THE BIBLE. I LOVE THE STORY ON SAMSON AND DELILAH.THAN AS IT GOES ON IT DOES GOOD TO SEE JESUS LIFE ON EARTH. HOW HE WENT ABOUT HIS WORKS AND MIRACLES. IT TOLD ME THINGS I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW. I REALLY THOUGHT JESUS DESCENDANT RIGHT TO HEAVEN. HE ACTUALLY STAYED ON EARTH FOR 40 MORE DAYS. HOW HE SHOWED HIS DISCIPLES HOW TO GO ABOUT SPREADING THE WORD ABOUT HIS RESURRECTION AND HIS LOVE. MOST MOVIES END RIGHT AFTER HE AROSE. BUT IT ACTUALLY SHOWS HIS DISCIPLES WORKING MIRACLES AND SPREADING HIS WORD. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW RUTHLESS THAT EACH ONE WAS MURDERED EXCEPT FOR ONE. HE WENT ON AND WROTE  REVELATIONS. GOOD MOVIE RATE IT A 5.,1364774400,5,675,4.2734375
5457139,5,B00AMR5FGA,"First, I want thank the producers of the miniseries on ""The Bible ""- Mark Burnett & Roma Downy.  A job well done!  I have ordered the series for my DVD collection - as - I also own ""The Passion""  produced by Mel Gibson.  They both coincide with The Bible on the most salient points that are necessary & important for our understanding of ""The Holy Bible"".  The interpretation was fair.  I am not an expert or clergy.  I felt that there were some inaccurate interpretations - although they were subtle and do not in any way detract from the events or importance of ""The Bible"" and it's story.  I highly recommend buying this miniseries.",1364774400,4,635,4.508771929824562

5457160,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The final installment of this epic brought me to tears - broken yet inspired! Though there were places that included things that have been argued over for decades, the entirety of this miniseries does as stated at the beginning of each part - it holds to the Spirit of the Bible. I've been a Christian for almost 33 years and was touched by this series. I'm ordering it and will watch it again. The crying thing will probably happen again too. This DVD review is not a proper place to argue historical dogma or logistical theology so I will focus on what I loved so much - their portrayal of Jesus. This DVD will be a way to introduce people to what the Bible is meant to be seen as so they'll want to read it to find the truth for themselves. I pray this miniseries helps as many as are willing to come to know Jesus the way I do - as He was, is, and always will be... as SAVIOR. I will end this review with my own fantasy novel farewell that has ties to Christian faith in more ways than one: ""May Tenrai Daystar shine down on you with blessings beyond sublime dreams!"" - Tonja Klein - Singer, Songwriter, and Novelist of REBIRTH OF EIRINTH 1 - BREAKING THE SHACKLES with eirinth com website.",1364774400,2,1194,4.26431718061674
5457161,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This miniseries is excellent.  I could hardly wait weekly for each episode.  It was five hours of the Old Testament and five hours of the New Testament.  I pray this series is the beginning of many, many more.  I kept my Bible handy and used it as a reference to make sure these were true accounts and to follow through with readings.  Treat yourself to this epic, you will not be disappointed.",1364774400,3,394,4.416666666666667
5457162,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I am a Christian and someone who loves the written word.  I also love imagery and so I absolutely enjoyed the mini-series.  I found myself anxious to see each week how the writers would deal with certain biblical characters and stories.  I read my bible often and am familiar with many of the books of the bible, but I learned some things that sent me directly back to my bible to search the Word for myself.  It's not perfect--some of the storylines were awkwardly told or just not accurate, but I agree with many who said if nothing else, this mini-series does start the dialogue and conversation, especially for those who don't know the Word or the story of Jesus Christ. Even my brother, who really hasn't read much of the bible during his life although he has attended church, has been calling me to ask different questions about Jesus Christ and the Old Testament.  It's a wonderful thing.

My only disappointment was that I personally did see a faint resemblance of Satan to President Obama.  Whether intentional or not, it was silly and mean-spirited.  It's hard to believe that the producers, who did a good job with the mini-series, could really have been that oblivious when they were so deliberate with casting the other actors.  They do know the features of the President of the United States and could have cast a different actor.  Some might even ask why Satan had to be portrayed by a dark-skinned actor rather than a light-skinned one. Nevertheless, I will purchase the mini-series and share it with my family and friends.",1364774400,2,1539,4.708955223880597
5457163,5,B00AMR5FGA,"I have to say that this miniseries was VERY good at getting across viable answers to this layman's take on the subjects covered. I learned a lot, as I think most who see this series do also.

At first I was just going to comment (as I have) in the ""most recent"" category, as it's what I always do in reading opinions and reviews. However, in scrolling down to the #14 entry by Godis 333 dtd March 31, I was struck by the his calm review and his opening statement and made it clear that he had not yet seen the series, but rather was commenting on the comments he's read. His review reflects an honesty I admire.

I have to admit that I deliberately waited for the end of the series to confirm what an earlier trailer I'd seen seemed to indicate, where Jesus was bidding farewell to John the Revelator, who appeared to be in a trance in which Jesus was appearing to him with a message. Jesus smiled, looking at John, held one of his hands out in such a manner as the wound left by the nail that had held his hand to the cross was displayed, and he calmly assured John that many of the sufferings that he and his fellow Christians had been subjected to would be alleviated ""when He returned"", which, in his very words would be ""soon"".

Lest you feel I'm about to criticise the concluding scene in the series, Be assured I'm not. One of the purposes of this series, according to Mark Burnett and Roma Downey was that they hoped the series would make people think a little deeper than usual about what they saw in the series.

There was no doubt in my mind that Jesus, always the truth teller, said what he meant when he told John he would return ""soon"".

I realize all kinds of questions arize when I make this statement. I will only say that as a person who considers himself a Christian Preterist of the ""Full"" persuasion, and who takes what Jesus says literally, IF there is no other acceptable reason to understand it otherwise, having said that He would come back ""soon"",he simply would have had to have done so one way or another. Unless, of course, the Greek language used in the New Testament dictates otherwise or has been misinterpreted. I,like other Preterists, believe he did come back, however, I will leave the persuasion of the reader at the behest of the hundreds of internet websites which can offer a pleathora of explainations for those of you whose minds might possibly be curious (or perhaps pricked by God?) to delve into the idea of Jesus coming back ""soon"" as in SOON-not 2000 plus years later.",1364774400,2,2515,4.4233261339092875

5457165,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I'm always a little nervous when someone takes something sacred to me, like the bible, and interprets it in their own way. But I liked the overall series of The Bible. They seemed to follow the book and main stories really well. And seeing it visually, also helped me learn a lot. I felt like it brought a good spirit, and the only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it was a little graphic for me and would be for children, and they pretty much skipped all of Adam and Eve which bothered me. But I still plan on owning this someday.",1364774400,,543,4.08411214953271
5457166,1,B00AMR5FGA,"""The Bible"" is the holy word of God. And being as such, it should never be compromised for the sake of sensationalism nor one's personal creative licensing. I make it a point of reading The Good Book everyday. And unlike many of my own colleagues who wouldn't know even a Cain from an Abel, I, on the other hand, am well versed when it comes to the source material. When I first heard a new attempt of bringing The Bible to life I was a little more than just intrigued. However, I did also hold certain reservations hearing that The History Channel would be sponsoring the project. I've seen some of their past documentaries pertaing to scripture, but never was really impressed. I've seen some of this show. I'm still not impressed. God Bless.",1364774400,11,744,4.559701492537314
5457167,3,B00AMR5FGA,"It's not as well-directed or acted or scripted as it could have been. There are some additions, conflations (e.g. compressing Eli's sons into Samuel's character), and inexplicable subtractions, especially in well-known stories. The special effects are decent.

It may be interesting to watch some of their interpretation of the characters' motivations and so on. And some of the filled-in bits are also interesting, such as Paul's recruitment of Luke. But it's the omissions (even in pieces they did include) that really hurt. Many important pieces of dialogue and events are expected but oddly missing. Thomas loses his iconic line, ""My Lord and my God!"" Stephen is stoned without any hint of his sweeping prophetic message and petition for God to forgive his killers. We do not see Paul before Felix; we just see him arrested. No tongues of fire are seen on Pentecost (although the dramatization - people actually speaking in different languages - was OK).

I understand there's a lot to pick and choose from to fit the important bits in. But surely many of these iconic lines could have been included.

Some other choices are a bit odd.

Of course, everyone was surprised that Samson was black, but I suppose it's possible, since anyone could choose to become Jewish.

There are some fight scenes added, including a swordfighting Asian angel in Sodom. Heh. And, as mentioned, some other imagined scenes. But many things are glossed over, such as Lot offering his daughters to be abused. Not to say that things are whitewashed; the failures and sinfulness of many Biblical characters is portrayed, although the many failures of Israel as a nation - frankly recorded in the Bible - are not highlighted here. (For example, their grumbling and wanderings in the desert.)

Appearances of the post-resurrection Jesus are somewhat subdued - not much in the way of pyrotechnics. This is accurate for many appearances, but I expected a bit more with John at Patmos. However, the sight of the nail prints in his hands is always moving, and the actor portraying him is compelling.

There are other little, annoying inaccuracies. But on the whole, it's a good overview of the Bible, connecting the major parts together. I guess it's expected that anyone who has their curiousity aroused would read the actual Bible to get the missing material.

5457179,1,B00AMR5FGA,"If people understand that this is a fantasy, not historic reality, then I might give it 2 stars.  It doesn't stack up to The Lord of the Rings by a long shot.  If you like fantasy, Game of Throwns on HBO would be a much better option.  If you really do want a movie with a Bible story behind it, then you still can't beat the old Charlton Heston ""Ten Commandments"" movie, even if the magical special effects weren't quite as sophisticated, the acting was at least decent.  Or if you just want to see a hunk (hot Jesus), maybe a porno flick is what you're really after.

If it wasn't already blatantly obvious that the producers and creators of this History Channel series had an agenda, the Satan character should be a hint.  The ""Virgin"" Mary played by Touched by an Angel ""star"" is not at all historically accurate and the producer, her hsuband, is also behind such nonsense as Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice program.  How can anyone take this seriously?

Obviously some people will swallow anything.  It's just sad that there are so many Americans willing to be sheep instead of thinking for themselves.  It is demoralizing that movies like this are aired on a channel calling itself ""History.""  It's just sad on so many levels.",1364774400,9,1236,4.623853211009174

I thought this series was well done and inspirational.  I have not seen the episode where satan is protrayed.  If I feel that President Obama's likeness was used to create the character, I will feel a great disappointment.  Regardless of how you feel about our president, the office must be respected.  But I will reserve judgement until I have seen the episode for myself.  What I did see was in line with what I learned in Sunday School many years ago.  The cruxification of Christ was more moving to me than the cruxification portrayed in the Mel Gibson movie.  But that is my opinion.  I enjoyed the series and am purchasing it so that I can see it from the beginning.  I hope that those who saw President Obama's likeness portrayed as satan are mistaken.

I have watched it on the History Channel and will be glad when it is out on DVD. I agree we do not know everything about some of the small things shown.  However, we do know from the way the Bible reads that angels are not docile creatures.  Also there are a few things I noticed the Paul and Saul name change was not handled well.  However, most of the other materials were great. I really enjoyed the Exodus, as well as, the way Christ was presented. I believe that this is well done and will be a helpful tool to evangelize anyone who needs Christ. That is what we are here for. Also this is a great way to get the conversation started with the Unchurched. If you feel compelled to correct something you can watch and then stop and do it. I hope that people don't miss the big points : God created the Earth and US, Christ was born,lived,ministered, and died for our sins.  These are the critical parts.  I loved it.

It brings it all to life and is purely AMAZING! I REALLY pray for a part two where Roma Downey and her husband produce more of the stories in Bible! This is a $29 WELL spent! PLEASE do not listen to the people saying things about what Satan looks like, or the producers getting rich etc.. This series is NOT about Satan it's about JESUS! The most high!

I don't care if you're a democrat or republican there is something called respect.  I, for the record, am a democrat and I think this entire country's disrespect of President Obama is disgusting.  You can chuckle about how they made him look like the devil and a lot of you (and I'm sure you will) will make a bunch of smart comments about it, etc but I'll tell you what even if this was a republican president I wouldn't like the fact that they made the devil look like Obama.  It was so blatantly obvious that you felt like smacking Roma Downey and Mark Burnett.  I hate to tell a lot of you this but our president is not to blame for every single problem that hits the earth.  I know a lot of you like to do it but many of you conveniently forget that St. Ronald Reagan started this whole mess.  I would've loved to have seen what the reaction would've been if Reagan was on the face of Satan.  My God this country would be hysterical and whine for weeks.

Do you know who I feel sorry for?  Mrs. Obama and I'll tell you why- she's supposed to have that Easter egg roll today and to many people will be snickering behind her back.

Oh why did I start watching it?  I figured why not?  I started it I figured I better finish it.  Did I mention I'm a white woman?  Not that it matters mind you, but where is the minority community here?  Why don't you defend the president Downey and this guy made a fool out of him and that was sick.

With all of this being said, here's what I didn't like about this.  Both Marys looked like they should've been on the cover of Vogue.  A lot of the cast were to clean, the scenery was to fake and what's with Mary Magdalene being everywhere????  Are you serious?  Come on, I'm watching this on Sunday school knowledge and I know she wasn't in that boat.  There were to many inaccuracies in this series, if you want a good movie about Jesus, try the one with Jeremy Sisto and as much as many of you whine about Mel Gibson's movie was much better, people looked more real.  To tell you the truth, Billy Zane's Barabus movie was better than this series.  Don't line Roma's pocket though, seriously, she and her hubby don't deserve it.  Here's the bottom line, you didn't necessarily have to quote Scripture but you could have given this a more realistic tone.

I can't for the life of me understand all those people who saw the same show that I did raving about it and especially claiming to have felt any kind of ""spirit"" moving through it. Well, perhaps the spirit of greed because that can be the only motivation for turning out such garbage.

I started watching this as a devout faithful Christian. I ended up a doubtful agnostic, bordering on complete atheism. No God that I could believe in would ever allow something this bad to be made!",1364688000,11,551,4.51

I totally felt the spirit and although I could tell some parts of the movie were inaccurate I was still touched by the spirit. I loved the scene of Noah, the scene of Abraham and the scene of Daniel. I have read those stories many times, but it was never as profound as watching it. I am a visual learner and these scenes were amazing. I really felt the emotion of Abraham accepting to sacrifice his son, the son he had been wanted to have all his life and yet he was obedient to God's words. The scene of Noah was pretty powerful as well, it made me think about the real man he was and how much he must have been trying to calm his family down during the flood. He knew what was going on and why, but obviously his family needed reassurance. I loved the scene of Daniel and the lions, the one where the 3 boys are tossed to the fire. For the first time I really got to think ""wow that must have been terrifying and yet they trusted God"". I love, love how loving Jesus (the actor) seems, I love this series. I think it is great, who cares about the little inaccuracies! After all, the point is for people to feel the spirit and I believe they totally will, once they are touched in their hearts they will on their own read the Bible if they want to know more... which they probably will.",1364688000,4,1421,4.170909090909091

Bravo to the producers!",1364688000,3,336,4.435483870967742
5457208,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I started reading the comments regarding the production as I often do before a purchase of books, movies, etc., not necessarily Biblical based.
I purchased this Movie this week and it is a great tool in Evangelism, even with the theatrical additions or subtractions of Biblical Reality.

I am a FOLLOWER OF CHRIST AND A BELIEVER in accuracy where THE BIBLE IS CONCERNED, after all, IT IS THE INSPIRED WORDS OF GOD and who can deter from that? The Bible should be consulted for all matters of life, as GOD has given us answers to everything our ""little human brains"" can take in and understand. If we cannot read it, then we should ask someone else to read it to us, and not necessarily give our input, unless we know what we have read to be true from God's point of view. A person needs to physically hear or read God's Word and God will guide them to understand what is right and what is not, if they truly are searching for answers. A lot of the answers they find might not be what they want to hear or read but GOD DOES NOT SAY THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE, OR SAY YOU CAN CHANGE THEM TO FIT WHATEVER IT IS YOU NEED, a FITTING FOR.

NOW, THIS IS A MAN-MADE MOVIE. MADE BY SINNERS AS WE ALL ARE. Man/Women are not without faults, and can be deceived in many ways. Therefore the WORD OF GOD...in perspective should be consulted by those wanting to know the true words of God. Those who already have read the Bible, should keep reading, as no one can know it all, EVER... IT IS AN ONGOING LEARNING EXPERIENCE, until we depart from this existence in human form.
So being a movie, made by man...EVEN WITH ITS INACCURACIES AS I READ IN THE COMMENTS, if it leads even a few people who are watching out of curiosity, or are SEARCHING FOR JESUS to learn and know about HIM, then that is good. Let GOD be the JUDGE as to whether it is not detailed in Biblical accuracy, to dates, color of skin, modern day ninja angels (which would grab a child's interest). No one should be the one who knows Jesus and presumably the Bible enough to judge what avenues God may use to start one on a search for more answers with His guidance. This is a modern inaccurate world in many aspects of God. To quote the Bible and condemn avenues that maybe God is using, to FIND HIS LOST SHEEP, in this last days of redemption is something true Christians, should refrain from doing!

The people with all the nit-picking, proclaim they are saved and that is permanent as Jesus stated so, but to condemn a ""MOVIE"" BASED ON INACCURACIES, that still teaches of CHRIST AND THE CRUCIFICTION, even with its flaws in other details, or who looks like what, DOES NOT REFLECT A TRUE CHRISTIAN LEADING OTHERS TO CHRIST.
If this movie gets the attention of ANY non-believers or strengthens ONE faultering Christian of today, and moves them on to a more meaning relationship with Christ, then all the minor details that are being nit-picked, and details that MANY WOULD NOT EVEN FOCUS ON YET, are really pretty unimportant.
We should be careful when we put negative thoughts into those who might be inspired by any device that has Jesus and the crucifixion in it...

So, I am just another instrument that God may use if he so desires, to lead others to think beyond their own judgmental personalities, and maybe inspire someone, even one, to listen, and maybe reconsider who they think they are in regards to the possibility to maybe turning someone away from Christ...instead of leading them towards him. We all answer in the end to God, so we should consider all aspects before putting our tongue out and possibly standing before God someday and explaining why they do these things. No one wants to be told, ""I knew you not!""

As a final comment? Prayer? on my part, I pray that those who watch this movie, may be inspired and search for more truths about God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit and not base anything on a movie, but turn to The Bible, God's Divine Word told by His Inspired Writers, for your answers.
A little inspiration for those who would like to look up my final Words of Wisdom from God himself! Ephesians 4:29 I could just quote it but then would You be ""Inspired to Pick up The Bible?""",1364688000,,4156,4.43455497382199

5457210,4,B00AMR5FGA,"The beautiful Jesus of ""The Bible"" series makes it worth watching, just as the real Jesus of the Bible makes it worth reading. What would the Bible be without Him? Yes, there are some wonderful accounts, parables, and verses in the OT, but would they still resonate as strongly as they do with us if it weren't for Christ coming and fulfilling those prophecies and leading an amazing, unimpeachable life? Of course, that's a topic for another discussion, but when we think of the importance of Jesus in history and spirituality, it's interesting to ponder what the world would be like if He had never made an appearance, or if we as a species had been allowed to develop further before He was sent to Earth. I often marvel at atheists who are so sure we should remove God and Christ from society and our belief systems, as if they know, a priori, that this would make the world a better place. How about we take them up on their offer and remove Christ from society, as a thought experiment, but at some date in the past. Should we remove Him before Handel wrote ""The Messiah"", or before DaVinci painted ""The Last Supper,"" or Michelangelo ""The Sistine Chapel""? Who knows how much their beliefs helped mold them as artists--perhaps if there were no Christ, there would be no DaVinci? It's absurd to think that all of the good things in society (art, literature, music) in the Western world would have developed without the West's single most overarching theme (Christianity), but I diverge.
.
My point is that Christ is the highlight of the Bible just as Morgado is the pinnacle of ""The Bible"" series. (Plz don't think I'm being sacrilegious, b/c that is far from my meaning. It's just that Christ had to be cast perfectly, and they have done that here.) His love and compassion shines thru in every frame, and adds a tender dimension to Christ that isn't often shown on film. The series isn't perfect, but once it gets to the NT and starts telling the life of Jesus, with Diogo at the helm, it improves considerably. In fact, if they would edit the 10-hours down to 5, and sell just ""The Christ"" portion, I would buy it and we would watch it in our home every Easter. That portion of ""The Bible"" is truly a classic.",1364601600,8,2215,4.54

On the one hand it is beautifully filmed, the best looking production on the Bible ever done, on the other hand it is full of 'seemingly small' innacuracies. The producers have taken liberties. For those with little knowledge of the Bible, it will be of no consequence, but for those who take each word as infallible and not to be tampered with, it can be almost sacrilege to see words added, or left out, or characters ignored or innacurately protrayed.

Don't get me wrong. I am recording every episode and enjoying the visual feast. But here's the catch - beneath the gloss does the substance remain? Can man tamper with God's Word and expect the same power to resonate from them? The Lord had warned that no one should take away or add to His words. I believe it has been done in this miniseries.

5457218,3,B00AMR5FGA,"Roma Downey's ""The Bible"" with husband/producer Mark Burnett made its debut in early March 2013. This highly anticipated miniseries achieved high ratings and praise from Christians and non-Christians but this could also be defined as a problem. Where was Joseph in ""The Bible?"" Was he not the link to the Hebrews entering Egypt? Did Moses plunge his staff into the Red Sea to divide it as the miniseries depicts? Did not God tell Moses to lift his staff, stretch his hand out over the sea and divide it (Exodus 14:16). Remember, a similar action later in the Wilderness disqualified Moses from Canaan (Numbers 20). When Jesus walked on the water during the storm and Peter joined him on the waves (Matthew 14) was it a dream or an actual event? The actor playing Peter awoke as if it was a dream. Before entering Jerusalem for the last time did Jesus know he would be betrayed and have to die on the cross? The scriptures say yes (Matthew 16, 17, 20. Mark 10. Luke 9. John 12:7 etc;.) ""The Bible"" depicts this differently. It is true that God can use anything for his purposes and ""The Bible"" had it high points (parts of Abraham, David, Daniel, Pentecost) but at what point should we be concerned about the current biblical literacy level of Christians who have applauded this production on various blogs, ministry websites etc.?",1364515200,19,1330,4.71244635193133

5457233,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I went to Catholic elementary school. The Romans, and in particular Pilate have been vilified throughout history for the way they treated the Jews, and in particular Jesus. In this miniseries they do it again. Here are some facts:

All of the people that were conquered by Rome paid two days worth of earnings to Rome in taxes per year. This was Generally to cover protection by the Roman Legions. How much of what we earn in the US are we forced to pay in taxes? About 6 months of every year, at last count.

Pilate had to deal with religious fanatics. He tried everything he could to free Jesus as he knew he was innocent, and no threat to him. He tried to free Jesus, but The Jewish Pharisees selected Barabbas, a murderer and thief, to be pardoned instead of Jesus, and seeded the crowd with ringers to demand his death. The priest in the mass even washes his hands during the celebration of the mass to show that Pilate washed his hands of the whole affair, and in the creed the statement ""He suffered under Pontius Pilate"" is stated. Every single time this statement is made I say to myself, ""No he didn't, he suffered because of the Pharisees"" Yet Pilate has been vilified through the ages, as being the cause of Jesus's death.

There is no doubt that Jesus suffered unspeakably, and the Romans were Brutal, but it would be nice if there were some real truth portrayed for a change.",1364428800,11,1389,4.460629921259843
5457234,2,B00AMR5FGA,"In a general sense, the series does a good job of opening one up to a broad understanding of the chronological flow and stories of the Bible.  However, for the serious who watch and listen, they will be disappointed that the literal words and phrases they are used to reading in the Bible in MOST cases are not used and are substituted with different conversations that are in the best case similar but more often than not connote totally different meanings than one would normally get from a reading of the Bible.  I personally don't understand how they go out of their way at the beginning of each part of the series to state that they try to remain true to the book when the most obvious way of doing that would be to use the words and phrases as they appear in the Bible.  One could easily work up a conversation that centers around the actual text of the Bible so the fact that they haven't put forth the effort here indicates to me that there is an agenda here and at the very least they are inept and at the most insincere in their claim to try to remain true to the book.  I've watched the series with my young daughter and it is disappointing to me that I have to CONSTANTLY pause the television to tell her that ""this didn't quite happen the way they showed it here...""  or ""what that person said [in the video] is not the Bible's account.""  I was very hopeful when I began to watch this video that I would get Bible stories that would have expanded, contrived conversations (necessary,of course) built around--and inclusive of, actual texts from the Bible.

Maybe it will even spur those unchurched Christians (which is actually the majority of Christians) to revisit a Bible based church other than at Easter and Christmas.

Only Jesus (and later Peter -  upside down) were nailed to crosses. The other big disappointment was when they show Jesus going into Lazarus' tomb...

5457255,5,B00AMR5FGA,"This is a great series!  I was pleasantly surprised about how accurate it is!  I wish they could have done all the major stories in the Old Testament rather than just a few, but when you're cramming thousands of years of history into 10 hours, you have to make some cuts.  Covered in episodes 1-4 Noah (who talks about creation and Adam and Eve), Abraham and Lot, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, Saul, David, Isaiah, Daniel, Joseph and Mary and of course, Jesus.  (I have not seen episode 5 yet)

I think the overall thread is very good and God is given the glory every time.  I do love how Jesus is portrayed . . . humble and compassionate but authoritative. I have read the whole Bible through several times, but I am getting some new insights from this series and it's much better TV than a lot of the junk that's out there!

If you are concerned about accuracy, I don't think you'll be disappointed overall. If you are a total stickler, you will see some things that aren't exactly as the Bible describes them (Moses should have had his sandals off at the burning bush and the Magi came to see Jesus at a house as a toddler, not the stable as an infant) but the overall message is accurate points to the Bible's author . . .

5457256,4,B00AMR5FGA,"Well I've seen all the 10 episodes (Each TV aired episode is divided into two 45 min. episodes on Dvd). I had very high expectations on this series as movie making is technically well developed with Computer Graphics and The Bible has the potential to make it visually stunning. It reached my expectations in some cases and not in few. Well we have to keep one thing in mind that thousands of years and generations may not be covered in a mini 7.5 hrs series & it is impossible (They should have stuck to only New Testament). So they had to skip many major portions (Not to mention, few of them are very important). But I won't complain about that because it needs a lots and lots of time, money and effort. But my complaint is that in whatever they showed, they should have tried to be accurate & skipped some unnecessary extra content as Ninja-Angels fighting in Sodom destruction, Young Moses fighting with pharaoh and many Roman violent scenes in New testament times. Bible has got a lot of destruction and wars. So it's not wrong to show these, but better to stick to the biblical wars and violence as Saul's and David's wars.
To mention few things, because of time constraint, they should have skipped few of these scenes and should have concentrated on narrating some important things in background and show few things as the pillar of fire protecting the Israel from Egyptian army while passing the Red Sea, pillar of cloud guiding them in wilderness. Also Abraham takes Issac to Mt. Moriah, which is 3 days journey from their camp (Genesis 22:4), but not just beside their camp. So without shooting the whole journey they should have skipped the scene of Sarah running after them (as it is not in Bible & also it is impossible to reach them as they are way ahead in their 3 day journey, they should have narrated it). It gives a better scope to see God as helper than not just judge.
Also while watching the Old Testament and it's violence, I was expecting that there will be no such scope in New Testament after Jesus comes (Prince of Peace) & So I thought they will show a great difference from violence to Peace. But to my surprise, they used the Roman rule to their advantage and made an action movie with New Testament as well. I'm not against to depict violence in Bible, but they should have stuck to the Bible violence as beheading John the Baptist and slaughter of children by Herod but Not Herod killing one of the two Jews with knife. I liked final two episodes on crucifixion and speaking in tongues in time of Pentecost and Paul's journey (Jesus hugging the cross and kissing it when he first sees it made me cry because that's how I imagined them as Jesus came for that very purpose). They tried to show from crucifixion to Revelation in just 40 minutes (Revelation is just under 3 minutes), which is impossible , but managed to show the important tings which stayed almost accurate to scripture. I was looking forward to see Jesus episodes but have seen more action than peace & teachings, but liked last episodes.
Well I'm not here to criticize, but want to advice one thing to all who are satisfied and not satisfied with this series, that you should use these videos only as a companion to explain and understand The Bible visually & do not expect it to be whole Bible. No one on this Earth can show complete Bible visually and can learn the things in Bible through watching movies or videos. The only way through which we can understand scriptures is by reading scriptures only and praying God to give us the revelation to understand them. Let us be happy that in this generation where everything is getting wicked, some people are still trying to show something which is not related to Sex or Drugs. Please encourage them for their effort and if you liked something in this series use them as companions to describe the scripture and ignore and skip the scenes which are not Biblical or offending. Well despite of inaccuracies (example King Darius sends Daniel into Lions' Den, but NOT King Cyrus as shown), I liked many of the aspects in this series and it sure deserves my Recommendation (Graphics worked well in scenes like Bible Intro with Noah, Sodom & Gomorrah destruction, Burning Bush, Ten Plagues, Parting Red sea, Jericho's wall destruction, The Lord in the fire with 3 men & City of Jerusalem..to name few) & I hope in future, they may keep one thing in mind that accuracy is very important !!!",1364169600,,4434,4.578616352201258

No one could ever capture the bible perfectly in a movie format, but I've really enjoyed watching the select stories come to life.

5457260,3,B00AMR5FGA,"First, the production value is really good.  The parting of the Red Sea was amazing.  They did a great job portraying Exodus.  But that's kind of where my liking of this movie ends.  They left out really important stuff - for instance, they completely left out Joseph which was the whole reason the Israelites were in Egypt to begin with.  I understand some stuff must be cut, but that was a key portion of scripture.  They had me up until about the middle of episode three.  That's where quite a few historical and scriptural inaccuracies begin.  I was thoroughly disappointed with episode four. We'll see how it finishes up.  But I'm on the fence with whether or not to actually purchase this when it's available.",1364169600,4,715,4.656

On a general basis, it is an excellent series which includes great actors, good music and fairly accurate scenarios as read in the Bible. The bad as many have mentioned is that cramming the entire Bible into several hour long episodes is far too much of an undertaking. They jump leaps and bounds between stories leaving out very important parts of the Bible. Needless to say, it's frustrating. I think since the series was meant to be so short, they should have skipped the Old Testament and only done the New Testament. Oh well, it's definitely entertaining and regardless of the faults I think the History channel did a good job.",1364083200,,702,4.669354838709677

The scene with Judas 's betrayal was incorrect making it look as though Jesus chose Judas to specifically betray him . Although I would have liked to purchase this series to add to my collection of Bible movies, I won't be buying it. Accuracy  counts and they were way off too many times . The Visual Bible also sold at Amazon is a much better series and it is accurate. I was disappointed. Why go  to all the trouble and expense of making a Bible series for Christians who know and love the story and then mess the story up.

The Burnett's (Mark Burnett and Roma Downey) from what I understand, had more than 40 advising scholars.

I am particularly impressed with the way Judas was handled. If judas had not betrayed Jesus, we would not be talking about the Resurrection. He played a necessary role, and we know that God is in control. It is clear that God is in control and faith ' moves mountains'. There is violence, but nowhere near the violence that is really in the Old Testament. It started out slow, but by the second episode, I realized the beauty of the artistic expression taken to bring this fine work to life.
The Ten Commandments has been watched for decades and no one complains about the inaccuracies. It was beautiful and captured the main idea which was us living by The Law.
The Bible brings us through to the era of Christ. Christ came to fulfill the law and free us from our sin through His blood.

I am so grateful for the Bible being portrayed so artfully, but so correctly.  I do believe the team who worked on this were serious about the nature of the Bible.

To those that have criticized..., this is a 'Movie' and Movies are scripted on the basis of writings.

There is only one mention of homosexuality in that story. The destruction was because of the peoples' sin, sexual immorality, and violent nature.

Is this the best acting I've seen? No. But its not horrible either. The acting is good. You don't become distracted from the story by poor acting.
Is it ethnically and historically correct as to the look of the people? No. This is the middle east, I don't think they were so white. I would imagine more darker skin and not as straight of hair (but hey I wasn't there so whose to say).
Is it enjoyable? Yes. It is very enjoyable and even moving. It made me look at the stories from the Bible in a new light. To not think of the people of the Bible as just cardboard cut outs, but real people with real hopes and fears.

Most of all it made me appreciate my faith and beliefs. I can look past the ""Hollywood"" aspects and enjoy seeing the Bible portrayed even it was made for entertainment. This is TV, not church. I don't understand why people want to mix the two. I don't go to church to be entertained, I don't watch TV to become a better Christian. Sure I would have liked to see more such as they skipped Solomon, left out some of the best parts of the story of Moses, and I'm sure they will leave out one or two of my favorite stories with Jesus, but I still am loving it. I've laughed, I've cried, and I've been reminded that faith in God is not always easy.

5457307,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I was really looking forward to a presentation that would accurately portray the Word of God.  What I found was a melodramatic movie that distorted the truth of the real Bible.
  There were too many contradictions to enumerate in this review. Just as an example, the section on Samson shows Delilah cutting about half of Samson's hair off. The scripture states that ""She made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head...""  Later, it shows Samson, with his still bloody eyes, pulling down the pillars of the building where celebration was occurring. The Bible indicates that Samson's eyes were gouged out immediately upon capture by the Philistines. They then put him in prison, where he had to work at grinding grain until some of his hair had grown back. This had to have been a period of weeks. The movie showed the Philistines' bringing Samson immediately, with bloody eye sockets, to the building where they celebrated his capture. Right then, Samson started to pull the building down.
  In the Bible, Samson asked a young boy who was leading him around, to take him to the pillars of the building, so that he could rest on them. At that time he prayed for God to strengthen him one last time, so that he could pull the building down. God did, and Samson pulled the building down, killing himself and more Philistines than he had killed in his entire lifetime.
  Another inaccuracy was in the story of Daniel, where Cyrus played a prominent role. The king who had David thrown into the lions' den was Darius. It would have been just as easy to use the right king, so why change it, except that whoever wrote the script had an obvious lack of knowledge, and didn't bother to verify fact with the Bible.
  I expect movie makers to use some dramatic license in filling in details, such as Moses' fight with his half-brother, although we have absolutely nothing to back it up historically. But when they take Biblical fact and change it, is where I draw the line.
  Other things were also bothersome. For example, why did all the actors have British accents? For a movie made in America by Americans, it seemed counterintuitive to use an all British cast, as if somehow their way of speaking lent more authority than our way of speaking.
  Over all, I felt the movie was overdramatized, and left out many pertinent details which would have helped to explain the transition of scenes, which often covered hundreds of years.
I stopped watching it halfway through part 3, where Mary was almost caught in a fight between the Romans and Hebrews. This is another made-up story to add drama.
  My fear is that many people who have never read the Bible, will now remember the scenes in this movie as portraying actual scripture, when the truth is that the movie amounts to ""false teaching,"" which both Jesus and the Apostle Paul warned us against.",1363564800,80,2909,4.641325536062378

5457319,2,B00AMR5FGA,"I read through most of the reviews of the most watched mini series, The Bible.  My thoughts of the movie are just that.  It is a movie.  It's purpose was to entertain.  No where in the Bible does God ""entertain"" people to know him.  When Jesus came, and he did come, he did miracles.  He healed sick people, he delivered people from their diseases, he gave sight to the blind, he had compassion and mercy on those that followed after him, he taught them what the truth was.  Every word he spoke was truth.  Every act he carried out was out of love.  The only way anyone can ever get close to God is by having a relationship with him.  You can not have a relationship with a movie.  If a movie sparks your interest to seek out the one and true God - wonderful!

But if you were to follow these stories along in the Bible while watching the series, you would see how this series has added much of their own ideas and thoughts which are not Biblical. Not only are they not Biblical, but they also cause contradictions elsewhere in the Bible.

YOU CANNOT take what is already COMPLETE AND PERFECT and try to ADD TO IT. Just doesn't work. If you want background noise- this would be nice. For teaching someone? No. For entertainment? Only if you enjoy correcting things. A lot of that to do in this series.",1363478400,23,580,4.576923076923077

Descriptions and details that are IN the Bible are not present in the series at points.  Abraham went three days journey to sacrifice Isaac, not up the hill so Sarah could run after him.  David used a sling to throw the rock.  The angels rescuing Lot and his family were not Kung-Fu fighters.  I could go on.  Point is, for those who know their Bible, this will be a disappointment.  For those who don't know their Bible, the simple details left out are large omissions because they give even greater glory to God.

5457328,5,B00AMR5FGA,"The History Channel took a giant leap of faith to begin a miniseries on the HISTORY as recorded in the Bible. The show begins with Noah and the Ark, Abraham and his tribe, followed by Moses and the Israelites and how God delivered His people from slavery. As a believer in Jesus Christ, this moving picture shows the living Word of God as active today as it was when Jesus watched us from heaven, and when He walked among us. Almost 100% accurate both believers, and non-believers will be re-ignited by this amazing reunion with our ancestry!  Mark Burnett and his wife Roma Downey succeeded in drawing us in to God's creation, and His purpose and plan for those who fail to be holy as He is holy. As a broad overview of the bible in less than 10 hours, it includes violence and the passion of God after His people.  Without sugar coating the anger of God, the sexuality of Sodom makes us put the world today in God's perspective. It was produced in a way to engage the viewer, and incite a thirst for more truth.  The script effectively connects the desire of God with our desire for more revelation. The script also includes the creative imagination of how Sarah may have responded to the sacrifice of her son.  The world today sees the wise men in the same scene with the shepherds every Christmas, while this is not accurate, the moving portrayal of the Bible will reach millions. The hope is that with top notch acting, the absolute authority of Jesus will cause people to want to question their beliefs about Who He is and the importance of what He accomplished for us all.  Today we need efficient, to the point storytelling for our fast food society! The epic visuals engage the audience that watches rather than reads.  Get to know Jesus personally, watch this and then read His living and careful, honest, all revealing word. We are encouraged to come together as believers, regularly, and remember that God came down to greet humanity as a man, fully God, fully human. This movie shows Jesus smiling, laughing, touching, engaging people by speaking in terms that would allow them to understand the Seed, the sower, the Vine, the branches, and His purpose. His generosity, His love is amazing to behold in a film that brings God all the glory.  Jesus does understands all of...us...as His, and He does not want one to perish without knowing the truth, that they are loved beyond human capacity!  Giving God the glory, the audience will praise Jesus, and the History Channel for showing the world that the TRUTH of Almighty God is a block buster! Real people, fall on real hard times. IMAGINE GOD whispering to you while you watch this! THINK whatever is True, Lovely and Noteworthy? That would be JESUS.  ""God is love"" and this movie shows the love God extends to His people.

5457339,2,B00AMR5FGA,"On the 1st 2 Episodes: This is coming from one who was reading the bible along side watching it. I felt that the first episode was better than passable as far as accuracy was concerned(certain things could have happened in a lot of different ways); while, the second seemed to become a biblical shell. Samson had no father. Both missed major parts that seemed to be unmissable in the telling of the bible: the story of Joseph, the sun standing still about Joshua, Jacob and Essau, details about Moses' and God's people in the wilderness(his and the people's faults), the Samuel and Eli relationship, and the Absalom problem. I also felt that Saul's story was moderately off and that David seemed too arrogant and prideful to be a man of God(at times, the prophet had to remind him where his place was and challenged the prophet when he gave him news that his child would not live after his great sin). Another thing is that they never showed where David was Godly sorry for what he had done! Almost as if God saw him as special even in the midst of his sin; that thought is utterly ridiculous. They should have done the screenplay off a really accurate bible story book(s) and then went from there, filling in the lose ends(other parts that they wanted to add)with the bible. Good bible story books are really inspired by the bible. The one that I read as a child was really accurate. I really felt that the creators may or may not have meant well, but--either way--it was too massive an undertaking to do without having tools at your disposal. They could have also did one or couple of major undertakings at a time(The creation through Abraham, Abraham's direct descendants, Moses to Samuel's childhood, older Samuel through young Solomon, adult Solomon through Elisha, etc.) and let a couple stand alone for awhile AND/OR Let some Christian churches and wealthy people invest in an idea, that was more accurate than most of the work out there and this would allow them to be as accurate as possible plus allowing there to be no delay with the accuracy. Instead of having no delay that was not well put together(as was the case). Also, can we ever make a biblical movie where the characters are historically accurate[with biblical movies, they make all the characters' lineage off--namely most are white people. Some could not be like traditional Jews in appearance--if they so chose--bc Jews had servants(which makes Samson somewhat believable), but most people in these movies should be traditional Jews in appearance. Note: To Prove Just How Problematic This Was and is For Practicing Christians, I'll just say that false images are created through treatment, media, video, and art! Many Muslims--whether they admit it or not--say that I'm not going to serve a white, blond, clear-eyed Jesus. M. Ali was raised a Christian, but used this as an excuse when he broke away from the faith and he--with his popularity and charisma--led many sharecroppers and Civil rights sufferers--who were only a generation or two from slavery--away from the faith. Malcolm X was known to refer to whites in evil terms before doing a 180 later in life(he lead some away from the faith and greatly influenced Ali). To me, it is not a legitimate argument, bc the BIBLE dispells the false images that racists and devils use to distort people down paths that they were not meant to go down when the truth's been in the bible the whole time; however, people do use this--and what they can see--as an excuse; I don't think that it was an accident that Jews(God's chosen people) seem to be the perfect mixture of all races--having white and black characteristics and it's the truth that is in the BIBLE besides; if it were not for this, many of these people would likely be Christians or sympathizers of it(still easily suasible to repent) and would not have an excuse for some charismatic speaker or popular idealogy to exploit and not be under the aspect of quickly passing time which breeds stronger loyalty in Islam]? Verdict: It has been seriously skimmed(important parts and people left out and it seems that it is becoming more of a biblical shell; therefore, I probably will not watch another of them)! Maybe the history channel(pagan channel--do your research) did edit out certain things or did dictate to the married couple what they would or would not air! Although them dictating to the couple is only a theory, they don't advertise it nearly as much as they do Vikings(no doubt full of paganism--do your research--the title is). Vikings is glaring across the screen announcing it on screen during its programs and the Bible show plus it is advertised on commercials, too!",1363132800,6,4663,4.800995024875622
5457340,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Unlike the other Bible thumping reviews, I could care less about whether a Bible show accurately gives us every detail in the Bible.  I just like watching Bible movies, much in the same way I like watching movies about Greek mythology (""Clash of the Titans"").  Giving the movie a bad review because it doesn't depict some particular detail exactly the way the Bible tells it is, frankly, ridiculous considering that essentially everything in the first five books of the Bible has absolutely no factual support either archaeologically, scientifically, or historically.  Harping on whether the angels in Sodom sliced people with swords or not is like debating how tall Santa's elves are.

Regardless, the stories in the Bible can make good material for movies and have done so in the past.  Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments""(1956), ""Ben Hur""(1959), John Huston's ""The Bible: In the Beginning"" (1966), Franco Zefferelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"", and Mel Gibson's ""The Passion"" are all examples of exceptional adaptations of Bible stories through quality filmmaking.  This show is not.  The production looks sloppy, with cheap looking costumes and sets.  The writing is stilted and the acting is horrible.  The way that this was hyped, I thought it was going to be this grand magnificent production with epic storytelling (a la ""Ten Commandments"" or ""Lord of the Rings), but it fails to even remotely come close to those endeavors.

5457347,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Note: I saw the first episode laat week via XFinity On Demand and about 10 minutes of the 2nd episode last night.

CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR EPISODES I AND II.

I was interested in this series when I learned that Roma Downey (star of television's Touched By An Angel) & Mark Burnett (producer of Survivor, The Voice and several other television shows) were producing this. I read in an interview with them that they used many translations because they wanted to appeal to the younger generation. That should have raised a red flag for me. I was stupid, however, and chose to see what they did with it. Now I wish I hadn't. There are simply way too many inconsistencies with the Holy Scriptures. For example, Lot and his wife are taken captive whilst they are on their journey to Sodom. Scripture clearly saith that Lot was already IN Sodom when the kings attacked Sodom and took him captive (The First Book Of Moses Called Genesis 14:12; ""They took Lot also Abram's brother's son and his substance [for he dwelt at Sodom] and departed."") Lot was alao depicted as very ungrateful when Abram pleaded with him to turn back from going unto Sodom. That simply did not occur anywhere in the Scriptures. Also, it was ABRAM and not Lot, who said, ""Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and me, neither between my herdsmen and thine herdsmen, for we be brethren Is not the whole land before thee? Depart, I pray thee from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right: or if thou go to the right hand, then I will take the left.""-The First Book Of Moses Called Genesis 13:8-9. Abram was also a man of faith, and he did not doubt when God saith unto him that He would make of him a great nation. Scripture saith, ""And Abram believed, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness."" He did not waver in his faith, and never questioned Almighty God, whining, ""Have I not shown Thee enough faith?"" Personally, I also think that Isaac did not protest unto Abraham when he was going to be sacrificed unto God, for Isaac was but a figure of the True Sacrifice, which is Jesus Christ, and His death at Calvary accomplished redemption for all the world. God did not need to tell Abraham to have faith, because he HAD faith. Also, the man in drag at Sodom-the clothes he was wearing looked way too modern. And where in Holy Writ doth it say that either the Angels whom God had sent to destroy Sodom or the spies which Joshua sent into Jericho engaged in a swordfight or other physical confrontation of such a nature? It doth not say that anywhere. And in the bit of the second episode which I viewed last night, it clearly depicted David cutting off a corner of Saul's robe when he was covering his feet, whereas Scripture saith that Saul was ASLEEP when he did that. These inconsistencies are but a few examples of many that time and space proscribe me from relating.

AVOID this miniseries, and view The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston or the silent version made in 1923, also directed by Cecil B. DeMille. I also recommend THE BIBLE...IN THE BEGINNING starring George C. Scott, Ava Gardner, Peter O'Toole and John Huston (who also directed) both the silent and sound versions of BEN-HUR (made in 1925 & 1959), The Prince Of Egypt and THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. All of these versions are closer to the Bible than this atrocious miniseries, the horrible computer-animated film The Ten Commandments and the 2006 miniseries The Ten Commandments.

EDIT-3/13/13

I have no interest in viewing the rest of this miniseries, as the scriptwriter(s) completely missed the mark with this project.

EDIT-3/16/13

Of course, no film version of a Biblical story is a substitute for reading The Holy Scriptures. I recommend the Geneva Bible, available now from Tolle Lege Press and or the King James Version. The niv, esv and the rest of the 'contemporary' or 'modern' translations are watered-down copies of The Holy Scriptures. Amazon will not allow links to be posted here, which is a shame, because there's literally a mountain of evidence that shows the errors in the niv, esv, nkjv and the rest of the post-KJV translations.",1362960000,35,4135,4.625340599455041

5457371,2,B00AMR5FGA,"When I started watching PART 1, it started with Noah and his family in the ARK resisting the opening scriptures in the bible.  I have for years been waiting for a book to book, scripture to scripture account of the bible in a movie or miniseries.  But, as I watched the first one hour, it completely went through various account so quick, that it just didn't make sense.  To do a TRUE depiction, it should've started simple from the creation, to Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel and work up to were we really start with Abraham.  But it went so quick, we hardly count build or form any emotional connect.  I feel the 1966 movie ""The Bible,"" directed by John Huston, was better in this manner, as it accounted the first 22 chapters of Gensis.  The Huston movie wasn't as generally accurate, but did do a good job in giving us a visual story to the written words of God.  I applaud for the accuracy the producers where trying to do, but this show should actually be a series and tell all significant stories, in detail and not be presented like a HISTORY channel documentary.",1362873600,9,1068,4.418367346938775

I am happy they kept it family friendly so my grandkids can watch it. The Bible stories as many know can be easily R-rated.

Nevertheless, if it can get someone excited about reading the REAL Bible and learning the true Word, it has some value. Certainly not worth paying money for.

UPDATE: I must admit that quality and continuity did improve as it came to Jesus. Worth $30? I guess that's to each individual to decide the value. My big problem with it now is the 30 seconds dedicated to Revelation. This was called THE BIBLE, not Most of The Bible, and the last time I looked the Book of Revelation was one of the most important books in the Bible. So why, with all the technical magic of Hollywood, could they not dedicate a much larger effort to present Revelation?",1362787200,8,806,4.676056338028169
5457374,4,B00AMR5FGA,"I have to admit, even though I've read the Old Testament surely more than once -- although it's been quite awhile now -- I was never a ""fan"" of the first half of The Bible as it's always come across as a bit gloom-and-doom to me.  But reading is one thing, and watching is another, although most movies about Biblical history -- ""Cleopatra"" with Elizabeth Taylor in particular -- are absolutely unwatchable.  People in film always seem to speak in ""high English"" and it just comes across as fake.  But not here.

If you've seen ""The Passion of the Christ,"" and you liked it (while I thought it was a tremendous film, it's still hard to recommend and I couldn't watch it twice due to the brutality) then I believe that you will like ""The Bible.""  Now, I've only seen ""In the Beginning"" and ""Exodus,"" but they were really good.  There is, yes, sex and violence, but hey, that's what goes on in the real world so just deal with it already.  And the dialog was believable.  So I found this to be far more realistic than most Biblical movies or shows that I've seen.

I did have a minor chuckle at one point, I have to admit.  When Moses comes down from the mountain carrying the 10 Commandments I laughed, not because the scene was intentionally funny, but due to the irony of the situation.  Just a few minutes earlier in the film, he had parted the Red Sea to ""let his people go"" through, but then released the water on the Egyptians, killing them through drowning.  Now of course, the 10 Commandments has ""Thou Shalt not Kill"" listed as one of those commandments and there would be the irony.  Well, The Bible does have some inconsistencies in it, like it or not.  How do you resolve those inconsistencies?  Well, I do believe that The Bible was written by many people with many different viewpoints.  And humans are quite flawed.

But this series, while not being flawless, is pretty God-dang excellent.  Not to take the Lord's Name in Vain, of course.",1362614400,8,1952,4.497159090909091
5457375,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Watching this movie is like watching a very long trailer instead of a movie.
Obviously you can't fit the entire Bible history in such a short time, but why use up time on fake action scenes (ninja-like fighting angels in Sodom) instead of mentioning actual biblical occurrences (Esau, Jacob, Joseph, golden calf) just to mention a few.

 What I've learned so far:  God only speaks to certain people secretly, those people are NEVER motivated or inspired enough to share His message with others (Isaac didn't seem to have any idea who G~d was) and it's much better to let your family think you're nuts instead of just explaining what God told you. Hey, sensationalism sells- right?  Women are clueless, faithless nags, and must always have dirty faces (shame on you Roma.) And for some odd reason, all middle eastern people speak with heavy British accents.

 What little subject matter you do get in this movie has been censored and repacked to come off as politically correct as possible, so as not to offend anyone, yet fictionalized enough to hopefully reel (no pun intended) the average teenager/unchurched person into  reading the Bible. However, good intention doesn't make up for lack of accuracy.

 Yes, it's totally understandable that you can't explain the entire Bible in such a small time frame.  But KNOWING this ahead of time, why did you bother trying? Very tacky.",1362614400,82,1379,4.93073593073593
5457376,1,B00AMR5FGA,"If you have absolutely no understanding of Biblical history and the events recorded throughout the Old Testament, I certainly don't recommend you watch the new Bible series on the history channel. It's like a bunch of writers with no narrative talent heard a few stories in a sunday school somewhere, decided to base a show off of it, and then grabbed a few excerpts from the most generic melo-dramatic scores they could possibly find to set as the backgroundmusic all throughout the ENTIRE thing. And then they decided to throw an asian kung-fu fighting angel dressed as a gladiator wielding two dull swords somewhere in the middle of it all. Considering this is the history channel, all we're missing is space aliens.
The Bible miniseries is a densely vague series of happenings strung together by events which seemingly have no connection to one another offering no explanations, no context, no development, and no substance, with wooden characters that are all on screen for only ten minutes at a time before being dropped entirely for new characters that also seemingly have no connection to one another all begging for our sympathy even though we've got absolutely no time to get to know any of them or how they even fit into this massively dense vague piece of shclop written by people who have absolutely no understanding about what they're even writing about. It's like the writers are ten year olds with ADHD tripping on cocaine. They have no attention span and their points are too rushed and incoherent to make any sense of.
I also felt it bordered on blasphemous while demonstrating a minute understanding of faith with an even smaller sense for how God works, it almost seemed repudiate. This series doesn't work as a drama because the characters are only on for fifteen minutes at a time before they're dropped entirely for new characters. It doesn't work as a historic chronicle because it's far too apparent the writers don't understand anything about Jewish customs or history, and they also completely fabricate lot of things while skipping over vital events entirely in some shameless and pathetic attempt at dramatization, offering no explanation for how the events are even connected. And it doesn't work as entertainment because it's so rushed and sloppily pieced together.
Needless to say, I didn't like The Bible (the series of course, not the actual book), at all, artistically, theatrically, or historically.",1362528000,111,2435,5.014814814814815
5457377,5,B00AMR5FGA,"My family and I all watched the first two hours of the 10-hour miniseries.  We have seen many, many Bible movies; but this one is truly wonderful.  It showed scenes that were different from other bible stories that we have seen; but, we looked them up in the actual Bible and there they were--presented as written in the Bible.  So, we also learned additional information. This miniseries is made in a down-to-earth super realistic setting of how life really was then.  We can't wait to view the next 8 hours.  Looking forward to owning this miniseries.  Marianne and family.  [Recommendation for a similar movie is the Passion of the Christ, by Mel Gibson.  (it is very graphic)].  We wish all of you  a Blessed Easter season.",1362528000,16,727,4.698412698412699

5457399,3,B00AMR5FGA,"I have only seen the first episode and was glued, and what I have seen so far, I enjoyed. My only complaint is that it us not as nearly comprehensive as I would have liked. It starts with Noah giving an all too brief summary of the time of Adam and Eve, Up to their timeline. They skip over completely of the Tower of Babel and skip to Abraham and then from there they skip over Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and skip right to Moses and Joshua.

5457401,2,B00AMR5FGA,"After being exposed to all of the hype about this movie over the past couple/three weeks I was really looking forward to seeing it. Sadly, I was disappointed and actually had to force myself to watch it thru to the end of the first episode and I doubt I will watch any following episodes.

The show is very choppy as it flits from one dramatic scene to the next and seems to pick and choose so it may dwell more on the sensational and dramatic events of the Bible. Being a Christian man and having read the Bible I could fill in the gaps for myself but I don't doubt that for anyone who has this as their first exposure to the Bible and its' stories wouldn't be a bit confused by it's being somewhat disjointed and leaving some holes as to what was going on in between. Although that could be good as it may entice them to pick-up and read the Bible for themselves.

I don't know if the producers were wanting to come up with an epic blockbuster such as Cecil DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" or John Huston's ""The Bible"", but whether they did or not they failed miserably in producing even a coherent, smooth flowing story.",1362355200,17,1120,4.354066985645933

5457405,1,B00AMR5FGA,"After watching the first episode, this movie has started out a big disappointment. This is all hollywood!!! It fails to tackle the important lessons of this period. It also skips through hundreds of years that are important as well. The scene in Sodom & Gomorah was sugarcoated. This was a city of fornicators, adulturers, homosexuals, murders, etc. Those group of men chasing God's angels were homosexuals that were trying to rape and murder the angels. Because there was not even ten righteous men within the city, God sent his wrath upon them. The movie also only showed the Israelites as victims of the Egyptians, but they were also worshipers of many false gods and were very disobedient to God. What happened to the Isaac the man, Jacob & Esau, Joseph? This movie is not a work of true worshippers of God because the most important truths have been omitted. In these times of this world's acceptance and glorifying of the many sins (fornication, adultery, homosexuality & now gay marriage,etc..) that God has always condemned, the truth needs to be heard even louder than ever.",1362355200,116,1083,4.891304347826087
5457406,5,B00AMR5FGA,"Watched the first episode last night and loved it. From Noah to Abraham and Sarah (including Hagar) all the way to Moses and Joshua thus far, this is such a great visual and dramatic telling of the Bible, especially for people who don't like to read -- or will only get to know Scripture through this medium.

I love it. I love it. I love it.

Can't wait till they get to Jesus.

The Sodom and Gomorrah part was quite amazing, and I loved the multiracial aspects of the angels of the Lord.

Sure, some super religious types may criticize for them playing a bit fast and loose with certain assumptions, however, like the miniseries makers warned in the beginning, they are trying to remain true to the spirit of Scripture. I've been privy to read a lot of the Bible -- and after being saved for 13 years, I still feel like I'm only scratching the surface of the infinite and deep wisdom contained therein.

But thus far the stories told have been excellently portrayed and stay true to what I've studied for years. Yes, some things may be inferred, but I haven't witnessed against anti-God displayed that I know of.",1362355200,26,1114,4.4950495049504955
5457407,3,B00AMR5FGA,"Saw the first episode and felt it was good television.  It of course very much sanitized some parts of the stories and in some cases add some creative license.  One notable sanitation was they changed the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah to violence and sexual promiscuity rather than the rampant homosexuality the bible describes.  There were ugly human failings that were omitted.  They failed to explain that Ishmael was the father of the Arab race that would spend all of human history from that day trying to kill the Jews.  This would have been a great tie in since the Muslim Brotherhood is linking all Arab nations together right now for that purpose.  (With American help I might add).  They also portrayed Moses with his hands held up in Triumph as they paraded him through the city.  According to the Bible Moses was the most humble man who ever lived and would never have allowed this,  plus he had a speech impediment, a fact that most movies skip simply because it would be hard to have a lead character who rarely speaks.

If the show interests some young people to actually pick up and read this book that has survived unchanged for thousands of years it will have served a good purpose.  A movie that depicted the bible factually would never be allowed on Television.  The controversy of what's in that book makes 50 shades of grey look like a coffee table book on Yoga.",1362355200,53,1380,4.587755102040816
5457408,1,B00AMR5FGA,"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- Galatians 1:6

The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  2 Thessalonians 2 9-12

Although the special effects of this mini-series are quite good, the content is deceitful in the retelling of the stories in the Bible itself.  True, there is a disclaimer that is displayed saying they wanted to do this in the ""True to the Spirit of the Book"" Which Book?  The Holy Bible does not contain scenes which were depicted in the first hour of this series.

For anyone to say yes it did... They have not read their Bible.  This Spirit which was talked about in the disclaimer is not in the Spirit of the Holy Bible.  To add words that were never spoken in the Bible is Apostate and heretic. It does not bring people to salvation.

The Scene in Sodom where Angels, drew weapons to save Lot and his family did not occur in the Bible.  Read Genesis 19.  The people of Sodom wanted to have sex with the angels.  Lot was going to give his virgin daughters to the people of Sodom.  This was left out of the Series.  (Intentional or Unintentional is up for debate.) The ill conceited notion that the angels drew weapons and began to kill the inhabitants of the people of Sodom never happened.  What did happen according to ""THE BIBLE"" The Angels struck the inhabitants with blindness.  To insist that maybe there is a side story where Angels did in fact draw swords is a ""Different Word altogether of the Bible.""

To say Moses was in conflict with the Pharaoh and struck him to bleed again is a different ""Word"" not depicted in ""The Bible"".  (Read Exodus for yourself.)

This series borders on deception.  To call it ""Accurate"" is a deception.

I understand people will disagree with this.  They have the right to disagree.  I encourage anyone who buys this series to READ the HOLY BIBLE.  Search the scriptures.  Pray.  If you feel deeply this series is accurate than that is between you and God.  Not me and you.

Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence, but a false witness utters deceit.  Proverbs 12:17

5457439,1,B00AMR5FGA,"Awful. We tried hard to watch the first episode last night.  Visually - costuming, effects, scenery - excellent.  But the acting and the dialogue is just atrocious. Wretched. When the angel that had Asian features turned into a double-sword wielding, spinning, kicking Ninja, that did it.  The whole thing should have been constructed as an actual mini-series, not a sort of mini-series-documentary thing.  This could have been so much better in more competent, actual movie producing, hands. Mark Burnett does ""reality"" TV and Roma Downey is not known for much other than a few TV series.  And it showed.  I was going to buy this series for my in-laws. Not now. We'll skip the rest of it as well and watch ""Vikings"" instead.",1362355200,56,725,4.853658536585366

This series is really well done. It is an overview of the whole bible in less than 10 hours, so they had to leave some stuff out, to make it interesting and develop some characters. We felt ourselves drawn into the story. it is very engaging and the producers have done a  great job keeping the thread through it all. I love how they connect all the dots and not just put all the stories next to each other. It starts w/ Noah in the ark, but he tells the story of creation and connects Adams and eves sin w/ the flood. They added their own imaginations to it,for example how Sarah would respond to the sacrifice. I also saw a nice clip of Jesus during  the interview and Jesus is portrait as a gentle man w/ authority. Roma gets to play the older mother of Jesus( What's exciting, bec I always loved her as an angel in the Touched by an angel series.)Sure it can be graphic at times, but it also could be worse.
