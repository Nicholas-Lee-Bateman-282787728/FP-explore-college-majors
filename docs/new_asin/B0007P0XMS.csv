8049876,1,B0007P0XMS,"I have been a yoga practitioner for approximately ten years and practice at home. Anyhow, someone gifted me this DVD and I just recently checked it out because I have been stuck on Shiva Rea for many years.
Jeez, where to start...yea, lets start with ego. RM appears obsessed with herself to the point it completely takes away from the sacredness of the practice; she is soooooooo busy talking, flipping her hair around and playing with it the entire video I could barely get through the mundane routine---there is no way I could watch her more than once. Who does yoga with their hair down and flips it--like a hundred times? It was as if she had OCD or something.... Put your damn hair up and get to work on cleansing with a focused mind....yea, no...Ugh...and the incessant flapping of the fake lips.....so L.A.
The routine itself is not challenging, in fact I found it down right boring....
Anyhoo, her egotistical behavior/neurosis made the whole thing seem corny and everything but spiritual and ""beautifying"". That is ALL she talks about...ugh....but cannot even remember the names of people doing the routine with her!!! Wow....gratitude much?!?! The only time she is not flapping, is when you see the intro (before and after) of her actually busting out some poses....
I don't usually write review on DVD's, but this one bugged me a little too much....",1430265600,,1361,4.84549356223176
8049877,5,B0007P0XMS,"I've been doing this same morning yoga routine for years!  When I lost the DVD, I was so happy to find it on Amazon!  Rainbeau Mars is my absolute favorite yoga instructor... First off, she's absolutely gorgeous (which gives me hope that this ""Yoga for Beauty"" thing actually works... lol), and secondly, she tells you exactly what the particular pose/movement is actually doing to your body as you do it.  I'm so happy to be able to incorporate this back into my morning routine!",1422489600,,480,4.690476190476191
8049878,5,B0007P0XMS,She is my favorite of all the yoga instructors.  This is more advanced that her beginner tape.  It is very hard to find her beginnner tape which is great for older people and those who are just beginning.  This tape is good for those who have moved past beginners but do not want anything TOO STRENOUS.  RAINBEAU MARS IS THE BEST!!,1363219200,,331,4.377049180327869
8049879,5,B0007P0XMS,I originally bought this video years ago. I lost it and have wanted it back every since. I have all her videos. She is great,1362355200,,124,4.0
8049880,5,B0007P0XMS,"I was very happy with this purchase, it arrived within a week and a half (which is fast to me) and the packaging arrived in very good condition and even though I was happy with the purchase, I returned it b/c I bought a 2 dvd set (Rainbeau Mars of her Dusk and Dawn) for the same price I had spent on one, so just make sure you look through all of the offers. Hope this was helpful to whoever reads this.",1235260800,2,404,3.9390243902439024
8049881,5,B0007P0XMS,"I am not one to typically write a review as I'm not usually moved by any book or movie as much as I am by this set of discs. I first was introduced to yoga through her Vinyasa Four Disc Set and have been hooked ever since (six years ago). I found these discs and couldn't resist. They offer both positive encouragement to go at your own flow but also the encouragement to continue towards the more challenging poses. There are individuals at every level leaving you with someone to watch and follow. These discs, while incorporating some of the previous poses found on her discs, include new material that are at times quite challenging, even for a more seasoned practitioner. The variations are easy to follow and while the set is done indoors it still provides a serene and organic setting for the practice.
I honestly cannot say enough about Rainbeau and the work that she does. If you are new to yoga or looking to expand your practice in the home she is the absolute leading authority to go with.

Namaste and brightest blessings!",1207785600,,1035,4.564516129032258
8049882,5,B0007P0XMS,"Rainbeau does this in a beautiful studio w/2 women & 2 men, 1 guy & 1 showing modifications. The music's beautiful slow & interesting with some chanting & ethnic guitar, etc. This DVD has great menu options such letterbox or full screen choice, dolby digital 2.0 or 5.1, gallery of pictures, workout w/o narration & the workout ends with a beautiful about 4 min solo performance of Rainbeau showing how advanced she is. There are also trailers for her previous DVDs: vinyasa flow, Dawn, Zen mama, as well as for yoga for wimps & Lilias series for the people who want a mature instructor.
The workout starts after a 3 min intro & ends at the 46 min mark including 4 min of relaxations/mediation.
Dr. Beth did a great job with telling you about the poses such as sun salutations (downward dog, mountain, standing fwd bend, plank, cobra), twisted crescent, modified butterfly, 2 legged stance, seated spinal twists, airplane, sphinx (easy stretch), lion, cat/cow, warrior 1, chair, etc. The pace is slow/very easy at first & then picks up speed & energy needed with some short rest periods after the harder poses such as 3 legged standing poses. I felt a lot more awake & positive when I was done & didn't want to stop. The pace was great since I felt very stiff at first from not doing yoga in too long a time.
The narration was great, she speaks during the poses as well as over the program. She is great is let you know what the poses help you do, such as twisting poses to help open your hips & simple belly cleaner with breathing to help digestion & other organs. She also reminds you that it will always be hard the first time & get easier as you practice.

On the DVD version there is a bonus 10 min workout of Rainbeau alone doing  simple sitting stretches, shoulder opener, cat/cow, down dog, belly/hip cleaners/opener. Sun salutations, crescent, twisted crescent & repeat. Sun salutations, warrior 1, repeat. Sun salutations, chair, sun salutations, twisted warrior 1, repeat. Sit, spinal twist, laying down butterfly & relax.

This dvd can be used by beginners who are careful & don't push themselves.

8049883,5,B0007P0XMS,"Yogini Rainbeau Mars, best known for her ""Sacred Yoga Practice"" series, has released a new yoga series titled ""Yoga for Beauty,"" and I recently tried the VHS version.  This series offers two practices, Dawn, or the sunrise practice, and Dusk, or the sunset practice. In both, Rainbeau instructs a class of four participants, this time in an indoor studio (although it is decorated with many plants to suggest the outdoors). Two of the assistants show modifications, one for limited flexibility and one for limited strength, although I would recommend some prior experience with yoga. While chant-like music plays in the background, Rainbeau offers both live and voiceover instruction: she speaks live while setting up poses and moving through vinyasas for the first time, but she switches to voiceover while poses are being held. Her left-right cueing is inconsistent; sometimes she mirror cues, sometimes she does not. At the beginning and end of both practices, Rainbeau is shown performing a beautiful flow of poses a la Ana Forrest in Strength and Spirit.

The first practice, Dawn, is 44 minutes long and is designed to awaken and energize in the a.m. It begins in a seated, cross-legged position for a short series of forward bend, side stretch with neck release, and side twist. Next comes a transition to hands and knees for cat/dog stretches, adding in a lion breath. From here, you move into down dog and then come into a standing forward bend position to practice what Rainbeau calls ""belly cleansing,"" which is a sort of nauli prep and which is repeated once. Then you move to the front of the mat for sun salutations: three half sun salutations, one round of sun salutation A with crescent lunge and an easy twist, then two rounds of sun salutation B, repeating crescent lunge and adding warrior one plus a crescent twist (cobras are subbed for upward dog in all versions). A final sun salutation B adds an airplane balance plus a fun transition to a simple seat twist before; you then move to lying to lie face down on the floor for some gentle backbends, including full cobra, spinx with a quad stretch, bow pose, and then child's pose to release the back. Coming seated, you perform a forward bend and cobbler's pose before double-folding your blanket under your back like a bolster for a supported final relaxation which includes a meditation on colors. The practice ends back in a seated position, with Rainbeau encouraging you to honor your work and touch your mind's eye before coming into namaste. I really enjoyed this practice and look forward to doing it often. This serene sunrise practice is well thought out, well executed, and well produced, and I would highly recommend it.",1113782400,20,2702,4.897379912663755
