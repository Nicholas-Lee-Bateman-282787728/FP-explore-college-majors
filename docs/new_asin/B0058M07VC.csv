4599740,5,B0058M07VC,"I own a lot of Billy's Dvds, so when I saw one that claimed you would sweat sizes I went all in!
This is one of his  harder workouts. I work out to Tae Bo 5 times a week for the last 5 months, and I still feel out of breath and can barely finish the last 5 minutes. This workout is fast, fun, and flows great. Everyone is sweating and tired, and Billy really pushes you. This is one of my favs and I can REALLY feel it the next day. On an other note: towards the end Billy has some crazy combos going on, so I recommend doing the instructional so you can get the hang of it.",1369699200,3,574,3.783333333333333
4599741,5,B0058M07VC,"I am buying this dvd for the second time. First one is either stolen or lost. I absolutely loved this dvd. I began working out for the first time and this was one of the dvds I could not get enough of. I literally used it every single day. He has so much energy that you don't want to give up. My purpose for the dvd was to aid in sculpting and increasing my stamina. Doing this video once a day (sometimes twice) did both. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who wants a worjout but don't actually want to be DRILLED! By the way, I lost ten pounds in weeks with just this dvd and eating better. Not even dieting.",1362873600,,614,4.040983606557377
4599742,1,B0058M07VC,"I do taebo as a fill in  with strength training and I enjoy them usually.  This one however..................... come on!!!!
The patterns ofthe steps are so complicated that Billy and his little blonde chicky screw them up.  No thanks.  This went directly into the garage sale pile.",1361836800,4,282,4.9361702127659575
4599743,5,B0058M07VC,Excellent video.  Highly motivating and tough. I don't like the stretching at the beginning which I feel is a waste of time but it only wastes a few minutes.  I would have liked the video to be longer but overall an excellent video.,1354924800,,232,4.372093023255814
4599744,2,B0058M07VC,"Usually a fan of the tae Bo workouts but this one is boring , the movements are so repetitive and basic and it doesn't feel challenging",1354320000,,135,4.230769230769231
4599745,5,B0058M07VC,I would recommend all of Billy Blanks DVDs to any and every one!!!  His method of workout has transformed by attitude and physical appearance.  LOVE THESE DVDS!!,1349740800,,161,4.925925925925926
4599746,1,B0058M07VC,"How many ways can I say I hated this dvd? First, I'm not sure about anyone else, but those people in the dvd are way too fit. More so, than the average American. When you're excersing at an intense level, you're NOT supposed to be able to count they way they were. Which by the way I found VERY off-putting and extremely annoying. I would have put it mute, only I would have missed the beat of the background ""music"". This dvd was really a waste of money as I was just too annoyed with it to continue. I genuinely did not like anyone it that dvd, they got on my nerves, epecially that blonde girl. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. This dvd is going in the sale pile.",1328140800,,671,4.129770992366412
4599747,4,B0058M07VC,"This video is very good. For people wanting to exercise at a intermediate level, it's perfect, you sweat a lot but feel energized in the end. It would not recommend it to Tae Bo beginners.",1322352000,3,188,4.4
4599748,5,B0058M07VC,"This is a great cardio workout. I love it. But I think it's more a Tae Bo cardio workout then a Bootcamp workout. Not so much military drill style exercises. Only little bit at the end. You sweat fast and you have so much fun during the workout. I realy feel the burn. Billy and the team push you during the workout. When you get's tired, listen to Billy's motivational speeches. This will help you in this workout. And me too.
Five stars for a great workout from Billy Blanks.",1317427200,4,477,4.311111111111111
4599749,3,B0058M07VC,"I'm an intermediate exerciser who likes to add Tae Bo in the mix of my other exercise routines (DVDs). Just finished doing this DVD for the first time.  The feel is similar to his Cardio Inferno DVD but a little more intense.  There are some classic exercises along with some new ones.  You have to think a little bit on some of the moves that have multiple steps. I gave it 3 stars because I wish he would have given a bit more instruction on the more complex moves.  Also, there were some moves that were a bit awkward in the video.  I will say that my favorite Tae Bo DVD is Tae Bo Amped, Full Throttle.  S.O.S. isn't as intense as that one but it's still decent.  All in all, I did like it, I did sweat a good amount and I will keep the DVD in my rotation.",1315612800,5,760,4.026666666666666

8461764,4,B0058M07VC,"To me, it's a bit too easy. Am an avid TE Boer who's always looking for challenge. This would have been it, except it has too many walk-it-outs in between takes. I barely break any sweat until the last few minutes .
In my opinion,  a beginner can do this. Still a good addition for lazy days, otherwise 6 have to supliment with anither short work out",1459382400,,350,4.223880597014926

8461767,5,B0058M07VC,This video will keep you on your toes. I'm using this video to lose over 60 pounds that I gained during and after my pregnancy. I can only get through the first 30 minutes but I'm working my way up slowly but surely after the first week I lost 6 pounds.,1427846400,2,253,3.980392156862745
