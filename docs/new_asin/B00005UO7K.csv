Someone has broken into the home of Abelardo Sachs, editor of ContraPunto, a Buenos Aires magazine, and shot him through the heart. Now it's up to the local cops to solve the mystery. Luis Luque is the cynical, out of shape, chief inspector. He is a police veteran who knows how to follow leads and interpret clues, but his job is made more difficult by witnesses who obfuscate the truth for personal reasons.

Buenos Aires is shown to good advantage in this slick thriller. There are great location shots around the city, including Recoleta, San Isidro, Puerto Madero, and downtown.

""Ojos Que No Ven"" is not on the high end of the artistic or intellectual achievements of the Argentine film industry, but not every film has to be deep. This is the kind of product a mature film industry turns out simply to entertain moviegoers; not worth making a huge effort to track down - but engaging. I'm giving it three and a half stars.

DVD features include non-optional English subtitles, scene selection, trailer and teaser.",1238889600,,1202,4.848780487804878

I spend a lot of time griping about the morass of mediocrity that passes for Hollywood these days, and when you're disillusioned with 99% of what Hollywood turns out, what can you do but assume that the average quality of what comes out of other countries is higher? This may be true, but Ojos Que no Ven goes a long way towards evening the odds. It's supposed to be a combination of mystery and psychological drama, but it fails on both counts. I'd offer up a synopsis, but in all honesty, I don't remember it well enough to do so, and it would most likely be a waste of time anyway; you've seen this same plot enough times to recognize it three or four minutes into this. Its predictability, ploddish pacing, mediocre acting, and shoddy directing never really improve from there; you might as well be watching a direct-to-video Hollywood mystery/thriller. Not worth it, for the lengths you'll likely have to go to to find a copy these days. **",1180137600,,1024,4.565217391304348

To a Latin beat? Another advertising ploy but not very accurate as the musicial track is your basic mystery , intrigue , suspense buliding music. So is the movie itself any good? Yes, but somewhere the plot becomes to mundane aand reminiscent of a half dozen other movies you've probably seen in this murder and mayhem genre. The movie starts with great promise with a stylish,  well conceived introduction. The opening murder scene and the arrival of the authorities suggests to the viewer that you are in for one good detective who-dun-it. The detective is your stereotypical, callous veteran who has seen it all and has a wise crack for nearly every situation. With the murder of the owner of a magazine entitled Contrapunto(Counterpoint) the lives of various employees become intertwined to reveal the possibilities of who exactly had the motive to do the dirty deed. A heroine emerges amidst the suspects  who has the  baggage of entanglements of a rejected and  new lover. She is easy on the eyes and has a certain youthful,  sophisticated charm to her that helps carry the movie. Actually all the acting is quite good and makes the movie better than average. Our heroine has many obstacles to overcome in her determination to find out who the killer was and assists the cops in doing their job.  By the time she is on the trail of the killer you probably have guessed who is responsible but there is enough chase through the maze to enjoy the flick anyway. The movie falls short of Hichcockian but nevertheless is a nice entry into the foreign film version of a good mystery. Recommended for fans of murder and mayhem  detective who-dun-its en Espanol.",1053043200,5,1821,4.743670886075949
