8348713,5,B0020XX5MU,"Over the decades I've used a PC I've seen a lot of training materials but this is the best.  It's on topic, focused, clear and actually works to bring a novice up to speed in an amazingly short time.

I used it in a corner of screen with Final Cut Pro open at the same time.  This allowed me to actually perform the actions rather than just watch and try to memorize.

Highly recommend it.

For more details, my next step will be the  ""Visual Quickpro Guide"" to Final Cut Pro.",1320883200,,476,4.175824175824176
8348714,4,B0020XX5MU,Overall a very good tutorial for the beginner. Would have liked more explanations of certain attributes of the processes it went over but not a big enough problem for me not to recommend this to someone beginning Final Cut Pro.,1252022400,,227,4.7
8348715,5,B0020XX5MU,"This DVD is really well done.  It actually taught me quickly, as it claims to do.  I thought it was brilliantly easy to follow and I kinda had fun learning it, too, enough so that it inspired me to quickly write a review and tell people how much I liked it.  If you want to start editing on Final Cut, this is the DVD.",1243987200,,318,3.9375
8348716,5,B0020XX5MU,"I have been editing for over eight years and I've found this video to be one of the most informative, intelligent, and well organized tutorials I have ever come across.  I would recommend this to any level editor across the board.  Final Cut Pro is the leading software for video editing and this is an essential item for anyone who is considering Final Cut Pro in their professional work-flow.",1241049600,,394,4.695652173913044
8348717,5,B0020XX5MU,"I have been wanting to use Final Cut Pro for my personal projects, but never got around to it because it just seemed way too complicated and time consuming.  The great thing about this tutorial is that it doesn't waste your time and tells you everything you need to know to get editing right away.  I also appreciate that it's thorough without being overwhelming. I had been using iMovie for the longest time, but it was really limiting.  I'm glad I picked this up because now I can take my videos to the next level.",1240012800,2,516,4.410526315789474
