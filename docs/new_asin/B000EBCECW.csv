8108006,4,B000EBCECW,"I don't know what the one-star guy is talking about when he calls this movie ""pretentiously feminist"". Why? Because it has female leads?

It's not the best film ever but it is interesting and as far as I can tell one of about two films available here that are set in Tunisia and aren't about World War II.",1406419200,,305,4.258620689655173
8108007,1,B000EBCECW,"This movie was the most pretentiously feminist, convoluted, unresolved piece of junk that I have ever laid eyes on. Save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Seriously.",1333238400,,193,5.0625

8108009,5,B000EBCECW,"I just saw this film at a screening today, and I loved it. It has a very complex narrative, wonderfully non-stereotypical characters, and a representation of Tunisian women that I've never seen before. It's refreshing to see how much can be done on such a low budget. It's the director's first feature film, and she did not get any funding from French sources. She wrote and directed the film herself, masterfully depicting a celebration of freedom in an era of flexible citizenship, shifting identities, and third-millenium technology. Awesome movie. Strongly recommended.",1143763200,8,573,5.3076923076923075
