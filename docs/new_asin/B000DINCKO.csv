8102428,3,B000DINCKO,"This movie is akin to Merchant Ivory Production.  It's beautifully made with Bologna as the setting.  The story concentrated upon a Greek & Latin teacher who was sent there by his esteemed parents to find himself a bride.  Nello, the teacher is a gentle, sensitive & gullible soul been brought up in a Roman Catholic all men's education system.  Therefore, we could see his awkwardness having to deal with the opposite sex.  His flatmate who happened to be a promiscuous individual subsequently introduced Nello to his girlfriend's sister, who happened to be a blind and tended to condescend on people and spitting on people's face whilst talking.  It's at the Asylum for the Blind that Nello found the woman of his dream, a semi-blind attractive socialite who still hadn't forgotten his previous boyfriend.  That woman happened to be a man-eater and she ""played"" Nello to win back her man.  At this point, we felt for Nello and we would ask ourselves why would someone so decent and nice deserve a woman like Maria.  Anyhow, love is blind.  Parents from both sides weren't supportive of Nello united with Maria because they felt that it's incompatible.  To cut the story short, the ending was predictable where someone bound to get hurt.  The movie soundtrack was very much along the tradition of Ernio Morricone as he did to Cinema Paradiso.  The story was self-explanatory and watch the movie for its beautiful setting.",1198281600,,1422,4.899581589958159
