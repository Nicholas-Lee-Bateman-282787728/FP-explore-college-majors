805680,5,6304199392,I thoroughly enjoyed this video.  I remember this series from back when it aired on The Family Channel.  Duncan Regehr is a masterful Zorro. Great performances by the supporting cast.  I just wish there was some way to get  the whole series on VHS.,932774400,7,248,4.568181818181818
805681,4,6304199392,"Over the years, there have been many films made about the legendary masked rider of Old California, but only two serious television series.  This tape, consisting of the four episodes from 1989 that began the four-season Family Channel series, introduces a Zorro that I rank among the top five, which include Regehr, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Guy Williams, Alain Delon, and Reed Hadley.  ""The Legend Begins"" tells the story of the origin of Zorro in a new way and with some changes to the traditional story: James Victor's ""Sergeant Mendoza"" is not the fat buffoon of previous ""Sergeant Mendoza""s but a likeable and sympathetic supporting character; the villain is not the Commandante of the garrison but now the corrupt alcalde Luis Ramon; and Zorro's love interest is no longer the traditional senorita but now Victoria Escalante, the owner of the local tavern and a modern woman with a mind of her own who's not afraid to speak out against the alcalde's injustice.  This story adds details to Zorro's origin that many must have wondered at, and there is enough action, suspense, and swordplay for everyone to enjoy, not just fans of Zorro!",900979200,6,1139,4.952879581151833
805682,5,6304199392,"Duncan Regehr plays Zorro in this Family Channel series from the early 1990s.  This entry is a 90 minute special recounting how Don Diego became Zorro in this particular retelling. Regehr brings a certain dash and intelligence to his Zorro. Coupled with the traditional black mask and swift stallion, the combination brings a new twist to the character,that of an inquisitive scientific tinkerer with the traditional superlative skill with a saber. This is a good entry to introduce kids to Zorro too. If television must be called upon to provide heroes again, then Regehr's Zorro is an excellent choice.  END",900028800,4,609,5.08
7864467,5,6304199392,"Good movie. If you're a Zorro fan, I would recommend this tape to anyone. My only regret is that they never put this movie, and Zorro Conspiracy Of Blood on dvd. That would have been Great! I hope they do one day.",1418601600,,213,4.095238095238095
7864468,4,6304199392,"I really enjoyed this look at the formation of this incarnation of Zorro. The acting is quite good, and while the cinematography is a little shoddy, overall it's delightful to watch.",1348531200,,182,4.903225806451613
7864469,5,6304199392,"I'm 57 yrs old and have been a Zorro fan/atic since age 4, and a Zorro video collector for years. In my opinion, this series is absolutely the BEST incarnation of Zorro ever made, and I have them ALL (with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions). Do NOT try to ""compare"" it to the Disney series. They're totally different styles. Both are great. The Disney series is pure WALT Disney style family fun. This series has more ""meat"" to it, much better character development, less comedy, but still quite a few comedic moments. Very family friendly but also excellent for adults.

This particular video is the ""origin"" story for this series. If you're only going to own one Duncan Regehr Zorro video, this is definitely the one to have. But once you've seen it, I guarantee you'll want MORE!",1289433600,,794,4.671428571428572
7864470,5,6304199392,I think that ducan regehr is a great actor. When I wath this movie it really impact me. There is a lat of action in this movie. In my opinion  he is a great zorro. From all the movies that I hava watch of zorro I think that this one is the best one that I have seen in my live,1130371200,2,276,3.5245901639344264

the spanish people survived before the twentieth century during the old west up until present day, the video is full of enteranment i would remmomend thiss video to any one.",1071619200,3,238,4.690476190476191
7864472,1,6304199392,"I love Zorro. The Z and all that! But this movie was not worthy of to 'wear the mask'.
What little story line it had didn't make sense. But that's not really that important for a Zorro is it?! It's the fun and the sword play. (That's important)
They didn't have any fun or sword play either.
Duncan Regehr might be able to act (I didn't see any proof of that on this movie) I'll give him the benefit of the doubt though; but he cannot fence! I am myself a fencer and sword fighter-whatever you want to call it. I've fought with Broad Swords, Rapiers, Short Swords, Knives, and even spears, and a whole bunch more medieval weaponry. I can tell you right now! Duncan Regehr can't sword fight. When I watch a Zorro I want to see somebody who might be able to beat me. The Sword fighting was pathetic. It makes me want to take on the whole Mexican army with my right hand tied behind my back!",1040860800,,888,4.1988304093567255

NOTES:
Although I've only seen 3 parts of this 4 part video,
be assured that this video will so gracefully and
brilliantly whisk you away into a time when things
were consolently and warmly simpler; a time abundant
with all the enlightening and enriching items of the
day such as pristine wide open views of the sunny
desert landscape of Spanish California, a roaring
Clipper ship gliding across the waters, a majestic
da Vinci hand glider, horses, a quiet and small
Spanish village, and a secret cave with winding
stone adornment. A treat for all of the senses!
P.S.  If anyone has seen part 4 of this series, please
fill me in on the details of what happens and any other
landscape/effects aspects, thanks!

7864474,5,6304199392,"I watched every single episode of The New Adventures of Zorro as a kid. I have them all taped except for about 20 episodes. And let me tell you, when I start watching them I cannot stop! Duncan Regehr is such a talented actor who puts so much into his roles. Yes, I was about 11 years old and I fell in love with the guy! The romance between Zorro and Victoria was so beautiful. The show had it all....and my favorite episode, ""An Affair to Remember.""  I'll always be a Zorro fan!",1020902400,8,480,4.161290322580645
