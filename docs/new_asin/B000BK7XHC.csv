8087604,1,B000BK7XHC,"I bought four different missionary bio type videos to help me prepare to teach a class on the Pioneers of Missions. This was the only one that was not helpful. It is not primarily the story of Amy Carmichael. Most of the time is taken up with showing the present-day activities of Dohnavur Mission. I felt that I paid for a promo video of this mission instead of what it was supposed to be, the story of a great missionary pioneer.",1361404800,2,431,4.333333333333333

8087606,4,B000BK7XHC,"This DVD I thought at first would be a movie drama about Amy's life. However, it is a documentary and a very inspirational one at that. I love to see how the work she started for the Lord so many years ago continues on and blesses and rescues children today. It is a real testament to the faithfulness of God in how He gives those who have come to Him through Christ the miracles that can make a difference when they choose to serve others as He has called them to. I only hope, not only hope, but strive to be like Amy because she really followed Jesus. By the power of Jesus I will make a magnificent difference in the lives of children in danger too. I know the children I save will grow up to serve the Lord and help others to truly know His love as well. Just like Amy!",1202860800,7,774,4.065359477124183
8087607,5,B000BK7XHC,"The Story of Amy Carmichael and the Dohnavur Fellowship is a true story. This is the testimony of how God used one woman to change the lives of many thousands people both while she was alive and after she died in1951.

Her ministry began in Ireland where she reached out to women working in the factories. Then she went to South India where she established a large work for girls in moral and physical danger.

Amy Carmichael wrote many books of both poetry and prose that have touched hearts all around the world.

Note that she accomplished this during an era that women did not enjoy the freedoms they have today.

The movie both tells the story of the early years as well as scenes and explanations of the current ongoing operations.

It is wonderful to behold how God answered prayers to provide a hospital long ago. And it still serves anyone in need today. It is beautiful to see how some of the girls that came there as infants are serving as teachers today. It is a blessing to note how in the large complex there are also ministries for the elderly and disabled.

This movie is recommended for anyone and especially for young girls, those that are missions minded and anyone that delights to witness the handiwork of God in the life of one totally sold out to Him.",1202601600,8,1274,4.4935064935064934
8087608,4,B000BK7XHC,"""Amy Carmichael's life is a model of selfless dedication to the Savior, a life of discipleship and abandonment. She lived for one reason, and that was to make God's love known to those trapped in utter darkness."" So begins a short biography of Amy Carmichael, provided by InTouch Ministries. Carmichael is one of those Christian personalities from days past that I have never had opportunity to study, though I have often come across her name in other writings. I was eager, then, to watch The Story of Amy Carmichael: And The Dohnavur Fellowship. This is a presentation, nearly an hour long, that provides a short glimpse at her life and examines the work she left behind--a work that continues to this day.

The distributor, Vision Video, says the following of the film:

  Early in her life, Amy Carmichael was called to the Lord's work. She never hesitated to answer Him. After extensive mission work in her native Northern Ireland, Amy set off to distant shores. She longed to be in China where many of her missionary friends had gone to spread the Gospel and help those in need, but the Lord had another plan for Amy Carmichael. She would soon find herself in the mysterious land of India where the suffering was great and where her faith would be tested to the utmost--a place called Dohnavur, where God's love truly exists.

This is a simple, bare bones film. It is well-made and contains enough information to provide an overview of Carmichael's life. We watched it as a family and benefited from doing so. And that, I believe, is as good a testimony as I can leave to a film. This makes an excellent choice for a church or public library, or perhaps a person library.",1200960000,9,1677,4.671186440677966
