8233293,4,B000YKYT5I,"The famous Japanese drummers visit Ireland and share the stage with some of Ireland's most famous musicians in this 2008 DVD release of an event originally broadcast on Irish TV in 1998.  Between performances there are interviews with Irish and Japanese participants.  Occasionally you'll see members of the audience dancing -- and you may want to dance yourself to infectious rhythms from two cultures.

Famous Irish performers who join Dnal Lunny and Coolfin on stage include multi-instrumentalist Sharon Shannon, dancer Jean Butler of Riverdance fame, and singer Maighread N Dhomhnaill.

Back story: in 1996 and 1997 the Kodo Drummers invited Dnal Lunny and his band Coolfin to visit their tiny Japanese Island for their Earth Day celebrations.  Having very much enjoyed these visits, Dnal then invited the Kodo Drummers to visit his country.",1381536000,,845,5.323308270676692
