8576066,5,B00C0TACFW,"ARBITRAGE is a very low key and fascinating film. ARBITRAGE is a darn good movie. The pace is very deliberate. As you watch the film you think you may know how it is going to end, but not really? The are actually several connected plots and events running through this film. You wonder if this is another one of those movies where it all comes together near the conclusion and it works brilliantly. Well, perhaps. Richard Gere's performance really impressed me. He seems to just get better as he goes. Gere brilliantly underplays his role like a professional poker-faced card shark and it is the vitality and energy that he brings to his role with this subtlety that keeps this film moving and very interesting.

I watched it three times now and it plays better each time. The morality of the story's outcome is something to ponder. This is a slick film that doesn't look slick.",1414022400,,878,4.628205128205129
