8269919,4,B0018L2TD6,"Great Movie. Completely different kind of normal ""action"" movies. It is about a person that almost drives crazy because he cannot believe in what he saw or what he did not see.

As mentiones by others: This movie will not bring new evidence about 9/11. But it is a well made film worth watching for sure!!",1412208000,2,305,4.446428571428571
8269920,5,B0018L2TD6,Paul Cross shows us that you can make a change even with a low budget movie. He shows the methods of the ones in power.,1375142400,3,119,3.8
8269921,1,B0018L2TD6,"Normally when I watch a movie that people have called bad I say ""It's not that bad."" This time I mean 100% ""wow that's bad"". Pretty much since the day it happened and even up to this point I have been researching 9/11 and have found that the 9/11 conspiracies are completely wrong and stupid. This film proves just how stupid the conspiracy is. There shouldn't even be a conspiracy based on the ""information"" this film discusses because it is very very misguided and untrue.

The main character is a psychologically ill 50-year-old man who writes a diary to Thomas Jefferson who ""uncovers"" that the Pentagon was actually struck by a cruise misslie rather than a Boeing 757. I won't try to debunk this because just by reading that statement you can already see how crazy it is. The main goal of the movie is to prove that the original report on 9/11 is wrong and that is was actually an inside job in which the U.S. government committed 9/11 killing nearly 3,000 of its own citizens for no real reason whatsoever.

The film was written, produced, directed and stars Paul Cross. His writing is confusing. His direction is lousy. His acting is pretty sloppy. Pretty much everybody in this film is a sloppy actor except for Dennis Kleinman as reporter Andrew Porter, who gives the information to Paul Cross' character.

During the 90 minute film I didn't get interested until the final 20 minutes when Kleinman is giving a huge speech in a forest, thanks to his acting abilities. The whole first 70 minutes of the film I was bored out of my mind and kept checking to see how much time was left in the film.

Trust me when I say that this film is borderline crazy, fictional and overall one of the most boring films I have ever seen.

Verdict: SKIP IT!",1346198400,,1747,4.533333333333333
8269922,1,B0018L2TD6,"It is hard to resist the impression that this lousy film was made to discredit the 9/11 truthers' viewpoint. It is disgustingly sloppy and doesn't make the slightest sense. I couldn't finish it and threw it in the garbage. Here is this guy working in the Pentagon, who worries because he hasn't seen any plane coming from his window, but then we, the viewers, are given to see the plane while he is looking somewhere else. What are we to make of that?",1342569600,,451,4.445783132530121
8269923,5,B0018L2TD6,"The subject is what hit the Pentagon, from someone standing in an office near where it hit. I thought it was well acted and written.",1284681600,3,132,4.32
8269924,5,B0018L2TD6,"I saw this movie at a friend's house and was blown away by it. I just had to order a copy for myself! For an independent film, it was amazingly well written, the pacing was just right to keep you on the edge of your seat, this movie is a monument to the truth.

After a while, you forget that this is an independent film, the message is so unshakable: America was attacked...and our enemy is not who we think it is.

The chemistry between characters is provocative: reporters searching for the truth, the conflicted citizen, the FBI agent busy investigating the crime that was committed at the Pentagon and their witnesses. To me, this movie is all about personal conflict of beliefs, its not bound by the confines of conventional thinking. This is not your everyday run-of-the-mill flick.

Cross is fearless in making this movie, he is a modern day Paul Revere. Bravo to him and I hope this is not the end of his contribution to the world wide awareness of such an important historic event. The way Cross has put this all together, even though we all know the events and how they supposedly happened, he leaves us with a chilling, esoteric ending.",1215648000,7,1148,4.563106796116505
8269925,4,B0018L2TD6,"I liked seeing a non-documentary movie on this subject. And the question still comes up , ""Where is the evidence of a 757 crashing into the Pentagon ? """,1214697600,4,152,4.275862068965517
8269926,1,B0018L2TD6,"People who follow the WTC-911 saga will learn nothing new from this movie. The cinematic device of a Pentagon officer maintaining a diary addressed to Thomas Jefferson should have been thought about at length, and then dismissed. The acting is stilted and dialogue B-grade. Whilst the Pentagon no-plane facts were reasonably well handled, the fact that the writer holds that the crash of Flight 93 is real was cause for concern. May be disinformation.",1214697600,2,451,5.108108108108108
