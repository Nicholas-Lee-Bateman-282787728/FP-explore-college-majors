8672881,5,B009Z1Z0C8,"I recommend buying the BD version (Vicom VB-6560) instead of this DVD version.  The BD version is rated for ""All Regions"" and therefore will play on any BD player.  The video covers the engineer's (motor man) view on the Joetsu Shinkansen line from Tokyo to Niigata for 2:12 hours.  All written and oral comments are in Japanese language but there is still value in viewing this video for foreigners.  Vicom.co.jp distributes 100+ videos (DVD and BD/25GB or 50GB)  on Japan Railroading and many brief video examples can be viewed on YouTube.  Some of these video titles are offered on Amazon.",1504396800,,592,4.87
