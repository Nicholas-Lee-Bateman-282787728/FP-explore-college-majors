2881331,2,B000S5RRQ2,"Not commercial quality as to scripting, lighting, sound, or video. Best part is that he can speaks clear, understandable English (unlike many imported Ba Qua DVD's). It felt poorly organized and an inadequate introduction to the art.",1280361600,,233,5.324324324324325
2881332,5,B000S5RRQ2,"This is an excellent learning DVD for beginning Bagua enthusiasts.  It will also be very good for those that want to review and sharpen their stepping and changing palms skills.

It is very good in covering stepping, reeling silk, threading, arm movements and especially good in covering the 8 palms stepping form.

Ted Mancuso is very good in explaining what he is doing, and very clearly demonstrates it.  The cinema-photography is excellent, the lighting is great, the perspective is great, and the DVD is very well set up for menus and stop/start points.

In the 8 palms form he first shows the change in a linear fashion while explaining it, and then demonstrates it while walking the circle.  He does a very good job of explaining while he is doing it (as opposed to other videos that just demonstrate without explanation).

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone that wants to get started or is starting out in Bagua.  And for anyone that wants to sharpen their circle walking and 8 palm change form.

I have been learning and practicing the 8 palm change described in the DVD and is really great exercise for the legs and stretching the body.  Practicing this form on a regular basis would be great exercise for all martial arts and for general health.",1213142400,17,1260,4.712328767123288
8204296,4,B000S5RRQ2,"I'm a beginner so I can't really say how good this is. I don't have anything to compare it to and don't know if it's authentic or good quality. What I can say is that it's a good supplement to my live class. It helps me to understand some of what I miss. It gives me the ability to practice with something at home and to have better recall of things. So, it's helping me to improve a lot more quickly.

The sound quality isn't the greatest. The production quality is not professional, but I don't really care too much. It doesn't need to be slick for me.",1521158400,,554,4.12962962962963
8204297,5,B000S5RRQ2,"Excellent DVD, clear instruction, super-fast shipping.  Based on this DVD, I'll be buying more of this seller's products.
Sifu Mancuso obviously loves his subject, as the care he takes in its presentation shows through.  This is probably the best introductory Baguazhang video I've seen.",1433548800,,287,5.5

8204299,5,B000S5RRQ2,"If you want to learn Ba Qua and can't get to a qualified teacher, this is the ""Must Have"" DVD for your library. I've purchased several Ba Qua DVDs trying to learn the basics but they all came up short. I'm glad I didn't give up. This lays it out in easy to follow explanations and demonstrations. I wish I lived closer to Mr. Mancuso to study from him - but this  comes next best to one-on-one instruction.",1404604800,,406,4.205128205128205
8204300,5,B000S5RRQ2,"These DVDs are very thorough and the nearest thing to a real teacher.

Any chance of a DVD dealing entirely with bagua zhang chin na?

That would be a real help.

Thank you Ted Mancuso!

8204301,5,B000S5RRQ2,"Driven by a long-held desire to study Bagua, while living in an area where there are no such instructors, I turned to Amazon one recent evening more from a place of wishful-thinking than anything else. The next thing I knew I was ordering this DVD. I can tell you that I am more than pleased with the contents. Sifu Mancuso's students are fortunate to have the opportunity to study under him in person. He is a personable man of character and I am grateful to have this vehicle from which to learn from him, even if it is electronic. In fact, given the circumstances of great distance, especially since it is electronic.

This DVD of a little background history of Bagua, then of warm-ups, hand and waist exercises, footwork, circle walking and of course the eight Palm Changes, is a life's work compressed onto a disc. I've since ordered the second DVD (vol. 2) as well as his two books and I've already found within a small sampling that the individual pieces complement one another very well if one is in pursuit of studying this beautiful and profound art. I am more than glad to have made the additional purchases for these treasures.

This is the real deal, and as was said by a previous reviewer, if you are looking to learn the art of Bagua through the form of DVD, look no further. If I were living in Santa Cruz I would approach Sifu Mancuso to see if he would accept me as his student. This is the next best thing.",1376870400,6,1425,4.435114503816794
8204302,5,B000S5RRQ2,"Let me start off by saying the production quality and the menu functionality isn't the greatest for this DVD. The lighting and focus are sometimes distracting. Mr. Mancuso has chosen to film all the segments at various locations, and this I believe contributed to the mixed results in production quality. The content however, is superb, and that's what makes this DVD a good purchase. Over the course of 4 months I was able to go through the DVD and learn the 8 palm changes of Jiang Rong style BaguaZhang to a sufficient level. You're not going to become a master by watching this DVD, or any DVD. That's not the point. You will be able to, with hard work, do what I did and become proficient enough at Bagua to say you do Bagua. Mr. Mancuso does a great job of showing multiple views both linear and on the circle for all 8 palm changes. He also includes valuable tips and information throughout. There is also alot of other good information handed out on the DVD on things like: qigong, threading, drilling, Bagua kicking techniques, applications, etc.",1361404800,2,1055,4.647058823529412
8204303,5,B000S5RRQ2,"This is probably the best martial arts DVD I've ever seen. I was pretty skeptical when I saw the 1980's production value, but before I even got all the way through the DVD I had already learned quite a lot. As has been pointed out before, the talk throughs are good, the changes are shown from more than one angle, and the chapter breakdowns are concise for easy navigation -- this is especially important because the first 20-30 minutes or so are dedicated to a brief history, stretching/chi kung type stuff, and circle walking...stuff you'll likely be skipping after a time.

I'm really pretty impressed with this one, and after I master the first DVD (the 8 changes alone are a lot of material) I'll be picking up the second DVD in this series.",1343347200,5,747,4.574626865671642
8204304,5,B000S5RRQ2,"This is a great video on Baguazhang. I immediately ordered the companion book and volume two of the DVD set. What I like about this video is that it breaks the Jiang style form down in a very easy to learn format. I have studied Yang style Tai Chi and some Hsing Yi  with a teacher but wanted to learn some Baguazhang.  I believe this DVD is geared towards the student who has to learn on their own in a self taught format. having studied internal martial arts I know full well that it is very difficult to learn from a video. I think that if you have some basic knowledge and experience with an art such as Tai Chi, you can use this video to learn basic Baguazhang. After all surgeons, pilots, law enforcement, and many other professionals now rely on video training as a part of their overall instruction in their fields. if you want to learn Bagua, you won't be disappointed with this DVD.
