7855889,5,6303910130,"Great thriller!  You won't want to leave the television!  Has mystery, romance, it's scary, can be somewhat violent, psycho thriller, keep in mind it's probably rated R or at least PG because there is some sex but not nudity, it is inferred. Lots of ""twists and turns"" in the story plot.",1389052800,,287,4.607843137254902
7855890,5,6303910130,"I loved this movie when I first saw it many, many years ago. I wrote down the name and have been searching for it since. Why doesn't the studio/company, make this available on DVD?  I am sure I am not the only person who would purchase this movie. Maybe if enough people request it, they will finally do it!!!",1275264000,4,309,4.237288135593221

7855892,5,6303910130,My husband got  this movie  on dvd for me one Christmas.  I couldn't believe Richard Dean Anderson  was  able to play a very convincing crazy killer.  Very good  movie except  at the end just after the murder attempt. I felt the  movie should have  continued  with the search for Ray and more. I liked the decor colors  used in the new kitchen. I thought Marg  was very  good too.  I still watch her on CSI.,1227312000,,407,4.24
7855893,3,6303910130,"Saw this to find out what RDA did before Stargate. It's OK, but it could have been much better. The actors are held back by a mushy story--not so much intriguing as confusing--a clumsy, generic script, and dirt-cheap production values.

RDA's character should have ben developed more. Is he an obsessed lover who went bad, or a bona-fide nut? If he's nuts, was he nuts from the start, or did the house do it to him?

Oh, and the ending? Good, lord, what was that? ""Woops, out of film...Eh, we'll just end it here, what the hell.""

A lot of interesting things could have been done here, but they weren't.

File this under ""RDA pays his dues.""",1132444800,2,641,4.452991452991453
