8047356,3,B0007GP7RI,This UK Haunted House comedy is a slow mover.  Some good moments but would have been better if the director picked up the pace a bit.  Decent picture and sound.  Connor and James are good.,1380240000,2,188,4.314285714285714
8047357,3,B0007GP7RI,"I love the ""Carry On"" series and most of the characters, but Sydney James and Kenneth Connor just aren't enough to carry this poorly scripted bxw film without the rest of the crew. Shirley Easton appears in the film, as she did in a ""Carry On"" film before she really hit it big, as does Donald Pleasance, later very big in the ""Halloween"" films. Some of the puns and jokes were fun and the actors tried to make the slow script funny, but I fell asleep twice during my viewing and had to rewind each time. I'd rate it a bit under the best of the early ""Carry On' films.",1326931200,,568,4.172727272727273
8047358,5,B0007GP7RI,"This is actually ""No Place Like Homicide"" and just as good a movie as it was when I fist saw it some 40 years ago.  Has all the elements that make a good mystery good.",1326326400,,167,3.7714285714285714
