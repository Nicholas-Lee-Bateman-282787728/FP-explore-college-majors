7084111,5,B00V9LTX1G,Our children are facing an obesity crisis that may compromise their long term health and shorten their lifespans.  This film shows the problems families face as we seek solutions.  This is a very difficult topic to face and to successfully address.  The film does a good job.,1436400000,,275,4.808510638297872
7084112,5,B00V9LTX1G,Great documentary!,1436400000,2,18,8.5
7084113,1,B00V9LTX1G,"Sadly pathetic. I love it how dad is in such 'great' shape and feeds his kids garbage food. Every time one sees a child that is overweight or malnourished, they should look at the parents since they are responsible for their child's well being. Isn't it interesting when the parents try to preach to their child as if they are not responsible what so ever.

This poor kid. The documentary looks staged.  Check out the part when he wakes ups in the morning. Every person that ever tried to wake a child up in the morning knows its a struggle. This boy was already up, and rubs his eyes as if to pretend he was sleeping. Its embarrassing that those from Food Matters pitch this movie for their own benefit.

The first day the uncle makes the young boy run and do exercise he is not used to doing. Anyone that has tried to lose weight or battled being overweight knows its never best not to go cold turkey or go too extreme on the first day.

The uncle and his wife, the guru fitness nuts, take upon themselves to preach whats best for the young boy and the rest of the world.
 Sorry to tell you two folks but the overweight pandemic is more complex that.",1436227200,8,1152,4.290322580645161

7084117,5,B00V9LTX1G,"Enjoyed it.  Shows the reality of dealing with a young person who may not yet truly understand the long term consequences of bad choices.  Also helped me see that it helps to implement these food and exercise changes in a way that the individual can relate to or enjoy more.  For example, a child (or anyone) may enjoy playing more than ""doing a boring exercise routine"".",1434758400,,371,4.590909090909091
7084118,3,B00V9LTX1G,"The movie was possibly a 3.5 but that option is not available, it was very much like the rest of the food documentary's out there... but still worth watching if you find interest in documentary's such as these, because you get to see it from a different angle, and how diet affects the kids, not much new info here in this movie but i did learn maybe 3 or 4 new topics as far as health goes. again interesting, but do not expect a mind blowing experience. what annoyed me is.. if i'm correct i don't remember hearing the child's age i could be wrong.?....and they mentioned that the child lost his mother due to illness, but never touched on the fact that the child may be going through serious emotional battles because of this..and that his  mother passing might also make it harder for the child to get on board..you may find it sad if you have young children...not very detailed as to the diet followed or the progress up's and down's... but successful in getting the public aware of the pitfalls in these modern times not just to adults but to children as well...3.5",1431907200,2,1071,4.464285714285714

7084125,2,B00V9LTX1G,"It made me uncomfortable watching these ""adults"" make a poster child out of this kid. It's not natural for someone his age to be so obsessed with body image. Jesus Christ, couldn't you have him play a sport or do something fun and let him be a kid while trying to lose weight gradually? What the hell is this? Jogging up hills, being forced awake by cameras...You can just tell he's miserable.",1503014400,2,393,4.472222222222222
7084126,5,B00V9LTX1G,"I love how this film had documented the struggle of this little boy. I felt his same struggle when the aunt and uncle tried to force their way of life (lifestyle) into him. When I started living with my boyfriend, he became a health nut and tried to force his ideals on me, before I understood why. I fought with him, I binged eat and ate junk food behind his back because I didn't know what to do and I wasn't willing to give it up yet. I missed the food I grew up with and I was forced to give up my culture (that's what I thought). Slowly I started to understand and moved into a better lifestyle. This film is a good way to demonstrate both healthy and unhealthy peoples' emotions perspective. To some, it may not be a great film, but you have to understand. Not everyone is educated what is healthy, what is the right food to eat. You can argue, TV advertisement definitely did a number on us by brainwashing us of what is wholesome food to ""NOT FOOD"".",1502236800,2,957,4.206521739130435
7084127,1,B00V9LTX1G,"I was watching ""Overfed & Undernourished"" in Primevideo and i saw that there are some inaccuracies
 in the meaning of some words coming from Latin or Greek. DON TOLMAN, wholefood expert, said that  Nutrition comes from ""nux""=""light"". In Latin, ""Lux"" is light! Instead ""Nux-Nucis"" it means ""NUT or HAZELNUT""! ""Nutrition"" comes from ""nutrio, nutris - nutrivi/nutrii - nutritum - nutrire""! Nutrix was the slave who had to breastfeed the babies.
And he continues saying that ""diet"" DEIT (totally invented!!!). It comes from ""daita"" greek and it means ""lifestyle"".
Etymology is a very interesting and serious matter and should not be treated like that, by a wholefood expert! Please be serious!
If you give the opportunity to talk to anyone without even verifying the truthfulness of things, how reliable can this documentary be?
Fed UP is much much better!",1501459200,4,852,5.166666666666667
7084128,1,B00V9LTX1G,"Nothing but fat shaming and torture.  Does this kid need to change his habits, of course.  But to put him through a boot camp situation is not going to change the way he lives.  After he goes home he will back to the same exact routine.",1499817600,3,236,4.086956521739131
7084129,2,B00V9LTX1G,"Pretty much biggest looser tv show for a kid. Extreme diet, extreme exercise, and likely short term weight loss. Because making sensible sustainable changes for a lifetime is boring as hell and nobody is going to watch that.

Very sad the film makers seemed more interested in making a more compelling movie and promoting their agenda than the ultimate health and happiness of a child.",1499731200,4,385,4.923076923076923
7084130,1,B00V9LTX1G,"I would give this video ZERO stars if I could. As someone who has been fit and active all my life and eats clean the majority of the time I was disgusted by this documentary. Is this child over weight YES he is. Did he lose weight by the end of the documentary YES. Will this be a long term solution NO and here is why. Dad doesn't even know how to live a healthy lifestyle and the way they introduced fitness to this child YES he is a CHILD was 100% the wrong way to do it. He's a friggin kid people. Seriously? Make fitness fun. Why on Gods Green Earth would you make an overweight child run hills to keep him active? He hated it as most overweight adults would and how often do fitness and diets last for adults when these changes are done this way? It doesn't last. They should have found a way to make it fun. Long hikes, out door games, bike rides, teaching him a sport. Martial Arts, swimming lessons, frizbee golf, flag football. I used to play flag football when I volunteered at my kids elementary school and it got even the over weight kids moving! Something that would make this kid stay active and not know he is. Also seriously vegans stop acting all freakin high and mighty like your way is the only way to be healthy it isn't! I hated this movie! HATED IT!!!! All the other reviewers who hated it I 100% share their views for why. Annoying and that aunt and uncle were the worst kind of people acting for the camera when in their head they were fat shaming this poor kid. Shame on them.",1498780800,19,1502,4.200692041522491
7084131,2,B00V9LTX1G,"Okay, I watched until day 50 something.  The kid looks the same as he did on day one!  No change.  With the support he had he should have been able to lose 20lbs by altering his diet let alone exercising everday.  This made no sense...",1494374400,,235,4.155555555555556
7084132,1,B00V9LTX1G,I found the Aunt and Uncle's approach completely humourless. They hardly ever smile and are unbearably holier than thou. I think they need to appreciate that there are different approaches to health and certainly different approaches to mental health (which is neglected to concentrate on diet and exercise). I guess they meant well but was their motivation to make a documentary as well as help their nephew? I ended up feeling sorry for him. His whole family (father and siblings) needed to be involved rather than shipping him off to this humourless pair!,1493078400,2,558,5.010752688172043
7084133,3,B00V9LTX1G,"I enjoyed watching Liam loose weight. I think it silly that they feel they can't eat meat to be healthy, but its what they believe so whatever. I just felt the kid could have had a tone of veggies and a grilled chicken and still been healthy and not struggled with so much rebellion. But...it was good. I wonder how he is doing now though?",1492560000,,339,4.230769230769231
7084134,1,B00V9LTX1G,"I liked the idea of the film, and thought it would be a good way to get the message out about healthy eating and exercising.  Instead, it included some of my most hated nutrition myths.
One scene shows a guy listing all the 'toxins' found in ice cream, along with their OTHER uses.  Like ""Chemical x is in ice cream.  It's also used in leather cleaner.""  What bull*****.  I could do the same thing with water.  It's fine if the guys wants to say that those chemicals are bad, but he needs to tell me WHY they're bad....don't just say that they're also in other things.
Another scene shows some fool talking about how some foods are ""closer to the sun.""  He's trying to tell the kid that more natural foods are better for you.  Sure, fruits and veggies are great for you.  But to act like the only foods you should ever eat ""come from nature"" is such stupid, over-simplified advice.

The program consisted of intense exercise (including some fun activities), eating mostly vegetables, and growing a garden, but unfortunately there was also plenty of nagging and shaming.  I would have much rather seen the father learn to provide better food choices and activities for his family, exemplifying leadership and self-discipline and benefiting his entire household.

I got to the part where the guy was preaching about some foods being ""closer to the sun"" because they grow on trees and talking as if home-made foods made from natural ingredients have no nutritional value (he references meat pies and spaghetti Bolognese specifically).

Also, I get the ""boot camp"" type setting his aunt and uncle were trying to provide, but there was no balance when it came to food choices and everyday life. It's hard enough to resist all the tempting foods around us as adults, let alone for kids when there are snacks at school that are less than healthy. I thought his aunt was a little mean to him about eating at the party at school. We slip and make bad choices when it comes to food, but we start again.

His dad seemed great too, talking about the challenges of balances budget, good food, and what the kids want. And I am sure the aunt and uncle meant well with Liam, although there was a fair bit of body shaming going on. I was disappointed, however, by the choice of experts consulted. Dr Anthony Golle is a Chiropracter who is anti-vax and believes chiropractric treatment can treat a whole lot of medical conditions that there is no evidence for. Dr Joe Dimartini is a previous chiropracter and current ""behavior expert"", but not a psychologist which would have been really helpful, especially in Liam's case given his grief abut his mum. Don Tollman is a ""wellness expert"" who again believes that a lot of medical conditions can be cured with healthy food instead of conventional medicine. I would have liked to have seen a psychologist help Liam with his grief issues, less body shaming, more practical advice about how busy parents can choose good food options and work with children to create an active and healthy household. And before Liam began his grueling exercise routine I would have like to have seen him have a consultation with a GP, rather than a chiropracter, to ensure it was a safe approach for Liam.",1475366400,,1343,4.894736842105263

1. How fortunate that this boy had someone to Help him.
2. What is wrong with the DAD,  he needs to be in this program as much as the Son?
3. Parents responsibility toward their children, includes everything!  My parents would make fun of my weight as a kid - YET< they were the ones buying the food I was eating.  I was just a frigging Kid - what did I know???  It wasn't until I left home, I was able to make the good changes I needed - and that was in my early 20's.  Father Died of diabetes, complications, lost his legs, at 62.  Mom, may have been skinny - had Chrons disease, dementia, and died from complications of Hip Surgery. 84 years old
4. Liam - though he was not happy about his weight - he resisted the changes needed.  To Him, it felt like a punishment.  Goes back to the parent - why weren't they involved with this as well.  After all - this kid did not get into this position without the neglect of the Parent.  HAD the parent shown a good Role Model...I would doubt this would have been hard on Liam.

I would have loved to see this boy years later - could he go back to his Old Habits.  What Changes DID his FATHER make during this time.

7084183,1,B00V9LTX1G,"Where's the beef? Seriously, this is a documentary where an obese boy is essentially blamed for the sins of his father, who raised him on a host of terrible food choices. Listening to the father speak, it is hard to tell if he was purposefully trying to fatten his children up.

The premise of the program is that you take the kid out of the house and exercise the life out of him, so that three months later he can return home to the frozen dinners, eggs, meat, and cheese. This approach misses the problem entirely, which is revealed within the first few minutes of the documentary. The child is raised on meat, dairy, and processed foods. In the entire program, meat and dairy aren't even mentioned, yet dietary nutrition has implicated their consumption as the culprits causing the epidemics of childhood obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, etc. The child could have been cured by simply putting him on a whole foods/plant-based diet, without any intervention by babbling pseudo-science chiropractors or movtivational speakers, and certainly not by exercising him before his body had recovered from the dietary damage at home.

I would highly recommend Forks Over Knives or Cowspiracy to anyone wanting the truth on how to cure themselves. Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes are lifestyle diseases with truly easy cures. Just stop eating animal products.

Rather than featuring this fat kid on long bike rides - on a decent bike -  he is shown on a motorized four wheel contraption. BAD idea.

7084250,4,B00V9LTX1G,I enjoyed this documentary. I would be interested to know if and how he maintained his weight loss after returning home because it is easier to change in an environment that is conducive to the changes you are trying to make. It is much harder to change in an environment that is set up for you to fail. I think an even better method is trying to change your environment so that it supports an overall healthy lifestyle. I hope he has maintained. It was an encouraging story. Also the aunt was so patient with him when he was rebelling I thought that was a good parenting example.

7084257,3,B00V9LTX1G,"The idea behind this film is awesome. Liam is awesome. But, I'm not sure that it's okay to push a strictly vegetarian diet on a child. At least it seemed that way in the documentary. I have a son who is almost Liam's age and is battling obesity, too. I myself am battling obesity. I definitely am walking away with new knowledge and more hope that I can help the both of us get better, feel better. But, there were some techniques used that I didn't really agree with- chastising a kid for not running enough and eating junk food that surrounded him at a school picnic, etc.. that's real world stuff that isn't about the aunt and uncle- it's about a broader problem of literally being surrounded by bad influences 24/7 unless you can live in that bubble of the vegetarian, whole food, no computers, running around on a farm all day type of life. What about the kids living in urban areas who don't have a playground or parents who are supportive? What about those kids who survive off of visiting the corner store for chips and soda each morning, afternoon, and evening? The ways they helped Liam are amazing but it's not all realistic for a large portion of the world.",1450569600,3,1169,4.4672897196261685
7084258,2,B00V9LTX1G,"In the beginning of the movie, the uncle says the problem is 80 percent psychological. Then the boy says he started eating a lot after his mother died. Does anyone talk to him about this? No! They just make him exercise and garden. When his aunt learns that he has been throwing away his healthy school lunches, she scolds him for not following HER plan. That would have been the perfect point to ask the boy exploratory questions - why does he think he's doing that - is he throwing away the food to avoid confronting the pain of the loss of his mother who probably also made him lunches? What might work better for him?  - instead of making it all about them. Both the aunt and uncle are a bit narcissistic.

I had a very similar struggle with weight as a child, and have been on and off of the torturous wheel of calorie-counting/macronutrient counting/dieting/extreme exercising/binges/remorse/shame/guilt and back to the beginning.  During the scene where the child is writing down all of the junk food he ate at the school party only to have the aunt calculate the hours it would take to burn those calories away, brought back so many memories of me doing the same thing.  I am not sure I have a solution; however, I can assure most viewers that that method will most likely cause future binges followed by future exercise binges, which in eating disorder jargon is called ""exercise bulimia.""

8709668,1,B00V9LTX1G,"I wanted to like this. I'm all for a food-scare to keep me from pigging out too much, but this video has too many distracting errors. I tried to use it as background sound while I work on other things, but I kept getting distracted by the ridiculous mistakes that the filmmakers should have caught easily.

The documentary part about the little boy is fine. If you ignore the ignorant (or intentionally misleading?) ""experts"" when they pop up throughout the movie, the rest is pretty good.

Now let's take a look at a few of the cringey claims from some of the ""experts"" this film consulted.

5:55
Dr. Anthony Golle, Wellness Doctor, Chiropractor, & Exercise Physiologist, lists ice cream ingredients by their chemical names to attempt a shock effect from his audience. What ARE those ingredients, anyway? Amyl Acetate comes from apples. Ethyl Acetate comes from radishes, cereal crops, or alcohol (the drinking kind). Aldehyde C7 comes from allspice, clary sage, California orange, bitter orange, the castor oil plant, and other sources. Would Mr. Golle have us not eat apples, oranges, or radishes because they are the sources of the ingredients on his scare-list?

6:40
Don Tolman, described as a Wholefood Expert, says, ""In the world today a lot of people have not looked up the etymologies and the root phonemes of words."" Apparently, Tolman hasn't looked them up, either. The word diet doesn't come from the word deity. Diet comes from diaita, the Greek word for a way of life. Deity comes from deus, the Latin word for god. The word nutrition doesn't come from the Latin nux. Nutrition comes from the Latin sna, which means to swim or flow. Also, nux doesn't mean light. The Latin for light is lux, not nux. In Latin nux means a nut or a worthless thing. Putting this all together, nutrition doesn't mean ""process of light,"" as Tolman claims. Nutrition means to suckle.

8:20
The old ""pink slime"" legend. This out-of-context exaggeration of a story has been debunked hundreds of times already. Try again, Mr. Golle.

51:30
Don Tolman again, this time talking about beets, ""If you have any kind of a problem with the heart, with the arteries, with the blood, if you want to get to the root of the beat of the heart, eat beetroot, because they have found that's exactly what it targets. It'll help to get rid of arrhythmias, palpitations, all kinds of things. That's why it's called the beetroot to this day, and most people don't know that."" The reason most people ""don't know that"" is that it isn't true. The word beet comes from the Latin word beta; the scientific name of the beet is Beta Vulgaris. The name of the beet couldn't come from discoveries related to heart disease since that research would've been done centuries after the naming of the veggie.

Ignoring the obvious ""they have found"" problem, let's look at Tolman's claim about beets curing all heart problems. Anything containing folate and betaine can help lower homocysteine levels, but beets certainly aren't the miraculous cure-all Tolman dangerously claims them to be. ""Any kind of a problem with the heart"": Heart disease can be fatal, some requiring immediate surgery. Don't try to cure your heart conditions with beets. Artery disease: arteries can be damaged by tobacco, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or lack of exercise; beets won't help you if you're smoking, for example. Arrhythmias: they can be caused by caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, or various medicines; most arrhythmias are harmless and don't need treatment. Palpitations: can be caused by caffeine, tobcco, alcohol, stress, or pregnancy; most palpitations are harmless and don't need treatment.

Now lets look at the dangers of eating too many beets (for those who fall for Tolman's claim and start stuffing themselves with beets at every meal in an attempt to prevent heart disease). Beets can cause kidney stones and gout; painful stuff, and you'll want to avoid beets if you have problems with these conditions.

And so on and so on.

I'd like this documentary if they cut out Golle and Tolman. I can't trust people like Golle and Tolman who present so many lies to make money for their food-related or health-related profession.",1531785600,2,4211,4.935028248587571

Running a marathon is impressive!  I didn't expect to see the dad there since he'd been absent for most of Liam's weight loss journey.

The dad needs to quit making excuses for buying crappy food for his family.  Liam won't be able to sustain his weight loss if his father isn't educated about healthy eating and the importance of helping his kids stay physically active.  It's Liam's father's responsibility to make sure the children get the counseling and emotional support they need to deal with the loss of their mother.  It's what's eating Liam on the inside that led him down the path to obesity.
