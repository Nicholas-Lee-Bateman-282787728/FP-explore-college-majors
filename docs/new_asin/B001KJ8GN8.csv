3665708,1,B001KJ8GN8,"This is a VHS quality video, and the presenter is more of an enthusiastic saleswoman for highly questionable 'muscle testing' techniques as the foundation of everything she does.  Her energy is not balanced, it's manic, and so hardly the kind of ""Energy Medicine"" I'm interested in.  As a practitioner and teacher of energy work (Qigong and Tai Chi) myself, I was unable to watch more than about 20 minutes of this over-hyped lady trying to sell me ('convert' captures more the religious zeal) on her peculiar approach.  I also failed to see how her techniques are integrated in any way, but rather piecemeal at best.  Buyer beware.",1392249600,13,632,4.878504672897196

3665710,4,B001KJ8GN8,"The exercises in this book lift the spirits, mind and body  if practiced daily.  The chi fair races around the body afterwards.",1386720000,,127,4.7272727272727275
3665711,5,B001KJ8GN8,"This is an easy read, and full of life changing practices, I have put into my own life.  I bought this for my daughter, too",1357948800,,123,3.92
3665712,4,B001KJ8GN8,"I love Donna Eden's work.  She really is the best, and the content of these videos is wonderful.  The reason I give it 4 stars, is because it is a VHS transfer.  I actually own all of this material on VHS already, so I felt a little mislead. I really wish it would have been shot in digital format for a better quality video.  Again, the content is still great.  The quality is not.  Honestly, start with the book, and many of the exercises are on the internet for reference.",1356652800,19,475,4.222222222222222
3665713,5,B001KJ8GN8,"Become empowered over your body with the wonderful information and tools in this book.  Donna Eden's info has changed the health and well-being of my whole family.  This book is invaluable for women who are wondering what the heck is going on with all these hormonal changes, life changes, etc.  This is the kind of data we need to learn in school.  You have this body - now learn how it functions and how best to operate it.",1331856000,5,425,4.410256410256411
3665714,5,B001KJ8GN8,"There is a lot of information, so I would recommend getting the book as well. Take the time to review it frequently.",1323734400,2,116,4.318181818181818
3665715,5,B001KJ8GN8,"My initial experience of Donna's work was from the book ""The Promise Of Energy Psychology where I read then practiced the 5 minute energy workout.

I then bought the book to learn more about Energy Medicine. After reading it, I thought to buy this DVD set to see it in action.

Donna's presentation is awesome. You can just get a sense of her energy and passion as she teaches this.

I use this daily before my standard practice of qigong or other meditation. The benefits are truly to be felt as you progress in your practice.

Particularly I do like that while the 'standard' form may be good in doing the exercises, she gives other ways of doing them to suit the person(s) should it come up.

While this product can stand alone, I recommend getting her book as well.",1299542400,30,769,4.464285714285714
3665716,5,B001KJ8GN8,"I'm a fan of Donna Eden and her work.  I've viewed her DVD: Introduction to Energy Medicine and found both her and her work to be fascinating.  That prompted me to purchase ""Energy Medicine:The Essential Techniques"".  I have found this book to be an interesting and informative introduction to the field of energy medicine.  So much so, I've begun the study of her work in depth.  If you are interested in self-healing techiniques and/or are tired of not getting the answers and help you need from traiditional medical sources, check out this book.  I think you'll be very glad you did.",1278979200,28,586,4.752475247524752
3665717,5,B001KJ8GN8,"It is one thing to see/read about an exercise in a book, and another to actually see it being done.  It is well worth the cost to be able to see it in action.  This DVD is very thorough and by an amazingly gifted healer.",1230422400,58,220,3.8666666666666667
8315019,5,B001KJ8GN8,"I've been diagnosed with breast cancer.  The techniques in this book have helped me feel less anxiety.  I also notice that they correspond well to practices in Qi Gong.  So, I think it isn't hocus pocus because a lot of what she says has support elsewhere.  I don't think it will cure me, but it does help me feel better and more balanced, and if you've been down the same road I have, that is a saving grace.  I would recommend it to anyone, as well as the Medicine Kit or the DVDs that instruct a lot of the practices as it does help to watch them.",1506556800,2,550,4.102803738317757

8315023,4,B001KJ8GN8,"The educational information is vast and thorough and well presented, Donna really knows her stuff! Each section is easily accessible from the DVD chapter menu. My main gripe however is the recorded videos perhaps look to be ported from VHS, which has been pretty much obsolete for the past 15 years so for the 70 price tag for 3 Discs it's a shame the video quality is so poor. Obviously this doesn't effect the quality of the content provided while learning  but none the less it's very noticeable when said quality is hardly seen these days. Overall, very pleased so far and will no doubt rewatch repeatedly to refresh and take everything in.",1436140800,3,644,4.699115044247788
8315024,4,B001KJ8GN8,"The video mentions that our ileocecal valve gets stuck. I never heard of that. I found out that its extremely common, see ""Stress and its energetic effect in teens"". The ileocecal valve is the only place used for Vitamin B12 and bile acid absorption per wiki. Later I rediscovered that it sits on one end of the stomach with the diaphragm at the other end. That gas can build up pressure within the cavity between the esophageal sphincter and ileocecal valves and possibly causing a Hiatal Hernia with a ileocecal valve or vagus nerve problem, see ""Hiatal Hernia: Hidden Cause of Chronic Illness"". I ran into someone that had already knew how to self-massage her Hiatal Hernia and asked her if she knew about the ileocecal valve massage. She didn't, but she is wearing a colectomy bag due to Crohn's Ileocolitis with ileocecal valve problems. The video hosted by ""San Rafael Functional Medicine"" or ""Energy Balancing for Natural Health"" adds to this understanding. She starts her test by thumping (1) each K-27 over brachial plexus' (2) ""Theragem Hrv assemblage point"" over thymus gland-cardiac plexus, 3) each Master Luo Connecting point. The vagus nerve feeds brachial and cardiac nerve plexus, the thumping may effect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nucleus ambiguous balance which effects respiratory rhythm, heart rate and heart variability rate (HRV) ISBN 0393707008. Often the body is neurologically disorganized or confused, which results in incorrect muscle test readings. The spleen can be equated with the parasympathetic and the Triple warmer (near radial nerve) with the Sympathetic Nervous System: Compare ""Triple Warmer vs Spleen"" with ""Autonomic Nervous System Health by Lawrence Wilson"". The parasympathetic effect may be due to ""Alpha cells"" secretions within bonghan ducts from the pancreas to the spleen - I am the first to realized that. Chromaffin cell secretions within the bonghan ducts may occur near the sympathetic radial nerve (a)(b). The sympathectomy surgeries proved that allergies can arise from the sympathetic system ""nonreaginic allergy in theory and practice"".  Parasympathetic dominance increases  IgA  due to greater vascular permeability:  ""Music enhances the effect of positive emotional states on salivary IgA"" People with allergies and autoimmune diseases may also be IgA deficient: ""Food Allergy and IgA deficiency"". These energy toxins effects can be measured: ""Raising and Lowering of Heart Rate Variability"". A breakthrough technique is needed to retrain the bodies response to food allergies. The DVD's Triple Warmer sedating and spleen strengthening procedure with allergic foods is unproven without salvia IgA and HRV readings (ie Stresseraser, Emwave, etc) . Here are some tests available for your doctor: ""Acupuncture and Heart Rate Variability"", salvia IgA US 20030087320, US8571653 ""Tracking Food Sensitivity"". The HRV LF of <0.15 Hz arise from increased sympathetic and decreased vagus nerve activity. Previous research uses different test points: ""Effects of Acupuncture on Heart Rate Variability in Beagle;"" (a) ""Bonghan Channels in Acupuncture By David Milbradt"", (b) ""Neural aspects of immunomodulation: Focus on the vagus nerve"" All information is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. This DVD is not tailored for acceptance of a wide audience, please see her youtube clips.",1411948800,5,3400,5.507662835249042

8315027,5,B001KJ8GN8,"It's good to learn how to muscle test you body to see what works and what is not good for you.  There is alot to learn about this, but if that is what you want to learn  this is a good way to learn.  You can take a section at a time and practice.  You can practice on friends and family, and it's fun.",1400284800,5,301,3.65625
8315028,5,B001KJ8GN8,"These DVDs are a wonderful resource for anyone looking to take more control over their own wellness and practice healing arts at home.  This set does not require that you subscribe to any ideology or belief system; rather it shows you a variety of ways to work with your body's own energy systems to provide healing and wholeness.

This is not meant to take the place of any medical practices you already take part in, but even Western medicine is coming around to the idea of holistic treatments, and these energy practices, once mastered, can supplement your ability to respond to and treat a variety of conditions and illnesses.

If you are open to ""alternative"" healing practices and want to take charge of your own wellness, this DVD series is a worthwhile investment (you should also pick up the book that goes with!).",1399766400,6,824,4.748251748251748
