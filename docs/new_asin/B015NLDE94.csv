7445165,5,B015NLDE94,"Just finished watching this and, while at first it doesnt seem to have a strong narrative, it gathers momentum as it goes and I was very caught up by the end. Its no small feat to make a film about climate change that inspires hope rather than apathy, but that has been Kleins message for a while now. I read, and teach, her book, but as a writer she tends to go for scope rather than depth, bringing together examples from across the world and skipping from one to the other to make her points. The film, wisely, slows down. Avi Lewis, the director (who also directed the wonderful film The Take, based on Kleins work), does a great job of moving her argument into a more human key, focusing on individuals and communities, giving you enough time to get to know some of the people fighting dirty energy extraction and struggling for a better world. After focusing on North Americans for the first half, including both Native/First Nations peoples and Anglos, the film moves out to Greece, India, China and Germany, before drawing the connections together to bring the movie to a very satisfying conclusion.

The movie also moves in a different order than the book. While the book opens with Kleins argument that unregulated/deregulated capitalism is the greatest risk to the climate, the movie focuses on one of her other main points, that we have been telling a story in which we can dominate nature, take what we want, and never pay the consequences. Making this the core of her narration in the movie lets her shift to the argument that we could tell a different and better story, one in which we acknowledge that we are part of nature; while she still makes her point about capitalism, its not articulated until almost halfway through the film, and is never front and center. This may make the movie easier to accept for some viewers and overall I think it was a smart bet to focus on the human impact of extraction and climate change, rather than trying to encompass her written arguments about the history of free trade agreements etc. It definitely makes the film a complement to the book rather than a replacement, but the larger message remains the same and what the film lacks in terms of complex intellectual argument, it makes up for in accessibility and emotional power. And I agree with Naomi: its nice to watch a film on climate change that is about people, not polar bears.

Regarding the negative review here, I had no trouble rewinding this (I have Roku) and didn't notice any abstract ideas or jargon at the beginning. I would think most people who are interested in climate change, or social justice issues, or like documentaries would enjoy watching this, whether or not they read the book.",1446854400,49,2712,4.671548117154812

We start out as an example with a very strange confusing observation of hers - something about how if we don't look at human nature and instead look at climate change as a story that can be changed, then it is easier to watch the polar bears flailing about.

7445277,5,B015NLDE94,"A very good overview of climate change from a slightly different point of view.  The Western model of Nature is that we can control and exploit Nature rather than live with it.  To some extent we can and have exploited Nature and successfully so.  But there are limits and this documentary is dedicated to showing them.  It shows Native Americans in Alberta Canada protesting a very large mining operation to mine oil tars for energy.  The locals are getting short-changed in the process as the operation progresses.  The plan is to fix the damage afterward.  The question is, will that happen?

There is also a protest in Greece where another company is mining for gold and the locals, once again, are not happy about it.  Locals in India protest large, new power plants that take their land and in China there have been a lot of protests over the coal burning that helps make for really bad smog in Beijing and elsewhere.

 China is in the process of dismantling its coal-fired plants and making more solar panels.  That's a step.
Then there's the conservative Heartland Institute, which thinks that coal is wonderful, we should burn more of it and that the whole climate change and conservation movement is a Marxist plot.

For the near term we will be on fossil fuels, but fortunately, people are moving over to renewable energy sources.  That is where we need to go and this documentary notes that it may come from the grassroots, from the little people, those whose land is being taken and used and they get shortchanged.  That's how they look at it and it's hard to disagree with them completely. And renewable energy has a lot of potential:  we just have to learn how best to use it.",1457654400,8,1691,4.643097643097643

7445292,2,B015NLDE94,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There is a sad state of affairs when it comes to climate change. That is the fact that there is no middle of the road being taken or discussed when it comes to climate change. Youre either all against it or all for it, period. At least thats what those on either extreme end would have you believe. My personal belief is that the majority of the people believe there is a problem, that we should find solutions to it and that we should have a rational discussion on the topic. The only problem is that if you say this out loud you are shouted down as being a denier for not completely agreeing with those who believe man has caused it all and a sell out by those who don't think it exists. So instead of a rational discussion with a search for answers the result is an attempt to silence all by one side and activists extremism on the other.

Both of these ideologies are destructive and, again, neither actually finds a solution that is a compromise where both parties can walk away gaining something. Instead greedy corporations will continue ignoring protestors and protestors will attack anyone who disagrees with them. Want proof? Note how many unhelpful clicks are found on any review of something like this film on sites like amazon, done so by people who are motivated only by ideology.

THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING actually has no clear cut solutions to the problem of climate change. While a very well made film it doesnt show a distinct way to save the world from pollution. What it does is rail against capitalism giving us a new boogeyman to blame for climate change. Perhaps new boogeyman isn't true, instead repackaging the old one might be a better way of describing it. Pictures of overweight tycoons puffing on huge cigars while watching poor people suffer while they make money are not seen in this film but they would fit right in with the depiction of capitalism.

The movie begins with the premise by author Naomi Klein, on whose book the film is based, talking about a discussion years ago by scientists who felt that they could become masters of nature. One line while discussing this states The earth is not, as most thought back then, a mother, to be feared and revered. This line reveals a lot of where this movie goes. More often than not references to the earth as mother run through the film. As someone who is open to discussion this is where the film lost me.

Through vignette after vignette the movie takes us to various locations around the world where pollution is a problem that is part and parcel with the problem of climate change. It starts with a location in Canada where oil is being drilled for but leaving its mark on the land. Indian tribes there are confronting the government of Canada including them in lawsuits rather than just going after the companies responsible for the pollution. There are several attacks on governments throughout the film.

Of these the one that made me scratch my head took place in Greece. Its common knowledge that Greece has suffered terrible economic catastrophes over the past few years. In an attempt to save their economy a mining company was started in one location. Protesters concerned about the problem brought that to a standstill and eventually got the mayor of that town ousted from office in the next election. That might be good for the environment but the economic problems continue. Most importantly the problems had nothing to do with the environment but a solution was shot down by activists who blamed capitalism. Forget about the fact that most of Greeces economic problems came from a government that couldn't come up with enough income to pay for the huge number of social programs the country has. If your sole source of information was this film you would learn none of that but hear about damaging the environment doing harm.

In the end what this movie becomes is a recruitment tool. Through subtle manipulations of content and choices of visuals being used it makes you think at first that the movie is all about how to combat climate change, a way to alter the direction the world is going and get us back on track to a clean planet. That would have been refreshing and a welcome film to watch. Instead by the last 15 minutes or so of the film were greeted with chanting crowds, sign carrying protesters and told how wonderful those who would lay down to blockade a road are. It brought to mind protesters in the occupy movement who screamed about Wall Street but when asked what they were protesting for couldn't find a cohesive concept that they could all agree on.

Im all for an open discussion on the topic of climate change and actually welcome it. One of the best film on the subject was COOL IT which featured Copenhagen Consensus Center director Bjorn Lomborg and his coming up with ways to combat climate change rather than to find demons in every corner. That film dealt with climate change and finding solution. This one just says theres a problem, that capitalism is at the root of that problem and that the solution is to protest. RACING EXTINCTION is another recent documentary that calls to attention the problems of man on the environment. But instead of activism it creates awareness and asks for action.

In the end there will be many who will love this film because it agrees with all they do. There will be others who will hate this movie saying it is nothing more than a love letter to the hippie generation of peace, love and understanding. For me it was little more than a propaganda film that took one side, slammed another and used that to try and get people on board with a movement. It has a slick look to it and takes its time to get to that recruitment point, but it is indeed there.

One thing that the age of the internet has done is make information available to everyone. After watching this film I wondered about the people behind it. Was there a deeper motivation for them coming up with their conclusions? Were they just everyday people who began this project in search of answers and found these to be the best solutions? Darn you internet. What I discovered was nothing of the sort.

Instead I found that the producer of the film Avi Lewis was a Canadian documentary film maker with ties to the New Democratic Party in that country, a democratic-socialist organization with goals of higher taxes on corporations and ideas to contain greenhouse gas emissions, who also had a show on Al Jazeera. The author of the book on which the film is based and narrator for it, Naomi Klein, is a social activist and author known for her political analyses and criticism of corporate globalization and of corporate capitalism. The odds of an objective look at their topic are highly unlikely given their beliefs.

But thats what documentaries have become in the last decade or so. They no longer take and open ended look at a topic, going in with no preconceived notions of what to expect. Instead they become propaganda pieces for film makers on either side of the political spectrum. They pick and choose whatever supports those preconceived notions and toss out the rest, especially when it proves those notions wrong. What would be a joyous day for those who love documentary films would be the day that objective film makers would return to the fold with an unbiased look at the topic they have chosen. This film does not lead us to that day.

I gave the film two stars rather than one because first the production values of the film are very well done and secondly because while I found the film to be little more than propaganda with no solutions, the people behind it at least believe in what they are saying.",1456876800,,7698,4.626647144948755

7445334,2,B015NLDE94,"Global warming is a fact..I live in Alaska and the glaciers have been melting for decades
BUT
I am hugely suspicious about ""man made"" global warming.  I am not above being wrong which is why I wanted to educate myself more on the subject.

Enter ""This Changes Everything"" Documentary

What a terrible documentary!  It is very much emotion based without specific facts.  A ton of broad facts: Oil is bad, Trees are good!  Corporations are bad, small farmers are good!  Oil workers are bad, Native Americans are good.  Okay tell me something new please!  This movie is definitely for weak minded, emotional people who are lead by their feelings and not with their head.
  Great job Naomi Klein on educating no one and getting ignorant people fired up about something they don't know any thing about.  Also, what does hardcore drug use among oil workers have to do with global warming?

I had high hopes to get some true facts about ""man made"" global warming but once again I came up short.  I really can't find any solid information but I can find ALOT of fear mongering and emotional hype.  Someone please point me to something substantial.",1451692800,8,1139,4.710659898477157

7445337,1,B015NLDE94,"This movie is practically pointless. Naomi wants the world to disregard capitalism but she offers no solution on how to solve the problems of feeding people, distributing energy to people, keeping people sheltered etc. The film itself paints alpha white males (read between the lines as you watch this) as evil corporate men who only care about money and the film paints beta males (hipster men), women and minorities as 'victims'. This is nothing more than a politically correct charged film albeit slyly done. Outside of that observation that will most likely glide over most peoples heads I come back to my first point. What is the point in making a climate change movie about the evil corporate white men, if you can't offer any solutions to solve the worlds problems? Stopping oil production is not going to provide energy farmers need to mass produce food. Stopping oil production is not going to let all the cars in the world magically keep on moving. Stopping oil production is not going to reformat old cities with new public transit facilities or rails. A lot has to be done in this world, including research into alternate fuels before we can stop our reliance on big oil.

I would like to see the earth clean as well. I would like to see everyone live with abundance and happiness but its not going to happen over night and crying about capitalism isn't going to change it and in the end that is all this film is, her crying about capitalism.",1451520000,10,1454,4.6796875

7445363,5,B015NLDE94,"This is an important film. It shows the fossil fuel industry's flagrant disregard for Earth and its inhabitability by humans. It suggests that we can change the way the world works, in order to save it. But it takes the participation of people globally, within their community, to stand up and, and through peaceful means (Blockadia), resist the radical overthrow of our planet by a handful of oligarchs bent on distorting the scientific consensus of climate change to line their pockets, (seemingly) oblivious to their own self-destruction and the denial of the humanity of all others. The great hope is that we can build a better system by overcoming this tremendous challenge. But what you see is the far-reaching scarring of the Earth, the people it harms (and their stories), the profiteers (including one within the tar sands industry who wants change to renewables), and those fighting the illegitimate power grab that's been escalating over decades. It shows that we must leave the fossil fuels in the ground and switch to wind-water-solar energy, because the fossil fuel we have already in reserve, if burned, will push us several times past the conservative 2 degrees Celsius mark beyond which we cannot sustain our planet. Earth is not our machine; it is an entity of which we are a part, and if we do not respect it, its own physics, altered by CO2 and methane, regardless of our subsequent actions past the tipping point, will reach its own equilibrium, without us.",1448064000,18,1478,4.9397590361445785

She's tired of climate movies, yet they spent four year going to all kind of countries to dwell on that same conundrums. I like her. She seems nice enough, smart enough, but this is all fluff. I love the planet, but this is a puff peace, for the powder puff girls. It's like every other climate change movies. I don't even ever want to read any of her books anymore and I love climate and science books. I've been to a few big protest and it's a drag. People are dumb, slow and greedy. The people only care when it happens next to them. All these stories were trite and boring. I think it got so many stars from others, because only people who like climate change dramas would watch this. This will not help much, seems just the same kind of lame as usual, but I doubt anyone but fanatics will watch it. It gave me less hope in people and documentaries and I make hippie documentaries and want the earth to be a better place. I guess it's all kinds of paradoxical, we want to save the earth, but really don't know how. We manufacture hope, then go hide in our comfort bubbles, to pop out occasionally when we run out of money and want to pop others comfort bubbles, but are just preaching to the choir. It's not easy and it's confusing, but what can we do? I don't know. I'm chill about it the more I want to rage against the machine, the more I have to take a step back and look at human nature and how apathetic and pathetic it is. It's sad, but what do you expect? People got here by exploiting each other and the environment, and that's hard to change. It was all said well long ago by truly talented people, but we are all too distracted and dim witted as a whole to really grasp what's happening or what we can do. Don't worry, just be. It could be worse and it will be, so make the best of it. Artist and intellectual activist will keep making hope propaganda, that's so lost and misleading, but that's how they make money, so let it be. Things change.

8734098,5,B015NLDE94,"After a distracting sidetrack into Hurricane Sandy and a slow but vital beginning, this film dives deep into GLOBAL climate and pollution issues.  It is great to see a global overview of the state of what is being done for and against climate change, so to speak.  The footage of the Heartland Institute's meeting is golden, and very disturbing!  They run a climate change conference, but it is not about dealing with climate change, it is a big business/conservative platform working to change the public's perception of climate change (that it is a liberal/Marxist hoax).  Very creepy.  The whole premise of this film is to view climate change, and also the fallout from its causes (smog, oil spills, further raping and pillaging of the Earth and its last remaining resources that allow us to live here, such as tress) differently than we usually do.  The last part focuses on how grassroots movements, in many many countries, even China, have been forces for change, so the message, in the end, is hopeful for a change.  It is inspiring to see poor or oppressed people in many countries stand up to power and make a change for the better. Makes us look fat and lazy!  It highlights how Germany's people came together and forced a change in energy policy, manufacturing, and living.  WE can do that.  Which is the ultimate message of the film.",1488844800,,1345,4.758620689655173

So, heres the big question[s]:

What if [climate change which includes] global warming isn't only a crisis?

What if its the best chance were ever going to get to build a better world?

The above is said by the narrator at the very end of this mesmerizing and sobering documentary, a Toronto International Film Festival Official Selection 2015.  It was inspired by the book also entitled This Changes Everything (2014) by Naomi Klein.  Klein narrates this documentary.

The way this film works is that it presents seven portraits of struggling communities on the front lines of climate change from Montanas Powder River Basin to the Alberta Tar Sands in Canada, from Beijing, China to Halkidiki, Greece.  Interspersed with these stories is Kleins narration, connecting the excess carbon that pollutes our air with the failed, capitalistic, economic system that unwittingly put it there.

The archival footage presented throughout this film will stun you, possibly enrage you.  It did this to me.

The last chapter of this documentary deals with the Heartland Institute located in Washington, D.C.  It is the leading group in the world casting doubt on the overwhelming scientific evidence for climate change.  Not surprisingly, it is bankrolled by some of the richest people on our beautiful planet.

Finally, the disc itself has three extras: deleted scenes (50 min), an interview with the narrator and director (35 min), and a trailer.  All of these are quite good.

In conclusion, this documentary is both factual as well as emotional and makes you realize that if climate change is taken seriously by all the citizens of planet Earth, then THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!!!
