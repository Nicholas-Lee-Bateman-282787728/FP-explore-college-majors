The series teaches the major elements of a preschool curriculum in a clever and engaging way, and some parts are so funny they had even the older ones crack up laughing. While each movie has a specific focus - the number, letters, fruits, animals - they also cross-reference nicely so that colors, shapes, language and counting are reinforced in each movie. The shows are very interactive, talking to kids with simple questions like you and I would. I particularly like the fact that these movies use still photos and images as I'm sometimes concerned about what too many flashy, fast-paced movies do to young kids' attention span. I also like that this series reinforces positive behaviors like politeness, hygiene (hand washing/tooth brushing), nutrition, creativity (painting) and respect for differences (boys and girls from different ethnic groups all in one train) in a subtle, unobtrusive way. Every DVD is different, with a different story line, different characters and a different voice, so getting the whole set is well worthwhile.",1329696000,,1139,5.162162162162162
8499929,5,B006K13T9M,"I would recommend this for anyone's who has got young children in their house. This pack of four DVDs covers a lot of the concepts that you would be trying to teach your child at this age, whether it colors, shapes, animals or food. What I also really like about owning all four of them is that all these concepts are re-enforced in one way or another in all the DVDs. For instance, even though Abby Apple is talking about fruit in one DVD, it will ask you questions about the colors and shapes of fruit, re-enforcing the concepts learnt in the other DVDs. Also, the train children are present in all the DVDs, linking them together.
All through the DVDs, there is brilliant use of animation, repetition, rhymes and catchy tunes that has made them extremely fun to watch and have held the attention of my three year old without a problem.
I think these DVDs compliment the learning that the parents are trying to achieve at home on a daily basis. Its pattern is very similar to what I would do at home with my kids--ask question to re-enforce the idea and that is exactly what is happening here as well. The interactive nature of the program definitely gets full marks from me!",1329609600,,1177,4.47906976744186
8499930,5,B006K13T9M,"As one of the few series out there designed for toddlers instead of preschoolers, this Snapatoonies series is a must have for every parent.  Offering variety with consistency, the DVDs are all interactive, focused on vital basic concepts, and simply animated to allow the toddler brain to focus and process.  Numbers, colors, animals, fruit, and shapes are the basic ideas presented, but are just the beginning.  Just as with life, learning opportunities are waiting around every corner.  Teachable moments are seized to provide depth, but accessibility to the content.  The varying character hosts and plot lines make this series one that bucks the repetitive pattern of so many children's series.  The journey through the episodes doesn't feel like a broken record.  My child interacts, learns, remembers, and makes life connections.  This is a great supplement to the early learning activities we are doing with our children each day.  Highly recommended by this parent and teacher.",1329523200,,985,5.303225806451613
