8723117,4,B000F42H5C,"With a name like ""Dry Wood, Fierce Fire"", it doesn't exactly pull you in, but this is a romantic comedy worth seeing. It is formulaic but well-executed, with some funny scenes and good performances. The basic plot concerns Alice, a rather eccentric person, who meets and instantly likes Ryan. The two become good friends, but Ryan likes another girl, Michelle, and asks Alice to help him win her heart. Alice agrees, and their friendship grows until it can't possibly be JUST a friendship anymore.  You already know how it ends.

Miriam Yeung is good as Alice, effectively conveying her eccentricities. Sometimes she comes across as annoying, but most of the time, we can relate with her. Alice is a girl who isn't particularly attractive, but has a wonderful heart, and is willing to suppress her own feelings for a guy just to be around him. It's sweet. Louis Koo is WONDERFUL as Ryan. I love how we first meet him: he's walking up the stairs in slo-mo, looking all handsome and macho. He reaches the top of the stairs, takes two steps, and faints. A co-worker looks at him and says (something to the effect of), ""Oh, he's fainted again. He was coming up the stairs so slowly, I knew something was wrong."" These little effects work wonderfully. Koo really parodies his lady-killer image here and has great comic timing.

The scenes that show Ryan and Alice's friendship growing are so sweet. They shop for furniture and a necklace together, they paint Ryan's apartment together, etc. I had a huge smile on my face throughout the movie.

Bottom line: 4/5.  Formulaic, but well-done.  Good performances from charismatic actors.  Worth a watch!",1173312000,,1643,4.825622775800712
