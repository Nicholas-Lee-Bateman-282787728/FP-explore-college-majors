I don't mind finding that a movie doesn't meet my expectations.  I do mind investing my time and money in a movie based upon the glowing Amazon blurb accompanying it, and then finding that I've been duped by Amazon.  If Amazon's film reviewers can be this far off the mark about non-Prime movies like this one, it would surely be preferable to simply summarize film plot lines, rather than attempt any objective evaluattion of films' quality.",1445904000,,617,4.80188679245283

Not many movies would focus on how difficult it is for a Christian family to fit into today's world. But this movie did it. It did it in a natural almost realistic way without the Hollywood hype and cliches, I think. You see a good looking young man wanting a car, wanting to impress his girlfriend, somewhat embarrassed by the churchgoer types he is surrounded by . . . actually wanting to escape to what is hyped as the hip . . . perfect world. But some Americans (I found this fitting myself) happen along and introduce him to that world. He willing goes along only to see that it isn't what it appears and definitely isn't something to aspire to. He stumbles. He fails. He falls. And that is the point of the movie I think. He found for himself that his life is the best it could be and he embraces it himself without having someone tell him he must embrace it. This movie is not full of nudity or rich people laying around looking rich or the good family wins $1 trillion dollars in Hollywood magic to save the family farm and buy the family matriach a new hip . . . it is just a realistic movie with realistic people limited by life. American movies used to have some of these characters. I guess we have all charged ourselves to a more important life than this to see it/appreciate it/capture it anymore.",1391299200,2,1369,4.3062015503875966
