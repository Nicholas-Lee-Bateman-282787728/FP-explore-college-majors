8754835,5,B01D41CEN2,"This was one of the best editions of the ESC ever - although I did not agree with the winning song. In my book, Austria should have gone home with the prize, but still... all three night were a pleasure to watch, the songs are (mostly) of a good quality, and so were the artists. Also, the interval acts were amazing. Do note that Justin Timberlake's performance is NOT on the DVD!",1469577600,,381,4.305555555555555

8754838,3,B01D41CEN2,"I am an American Eurovision fan, and I was hesitant to buy this DVD at first, because the description said that the format was NTSC, but the picture said PAL! I asked another American Eurovision fan if the DVD worked for him, and it did (he has a portable DVD/Blu-ray player), so I decided to buy it. I was excited to finally receive it in the mail, but I nearly returned it for a refund after it did not play on two DVD players! Later on, I found out that it works on the DVD player in our living room that can hold 5 DVDs and my mom's laptop. I was very disappointed overall, but I am glad it works on some players!",1467072000,,617,4.024390243902439
