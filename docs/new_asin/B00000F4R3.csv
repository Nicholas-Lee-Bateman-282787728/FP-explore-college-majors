8465993,3,B00000F4R3,This movie was not as bad as most people made it out to be.  This again falls into the area where it was a little known film with some really big acting but the plot line wasn't that bad and the acting wasn't either.  Was it the best?  Not by a long shot but I've seen considerably worst acting in major motion pictures.  I would love to see Anchor Bay re-release this film on DVD.,1193961600,4,381,4.04
