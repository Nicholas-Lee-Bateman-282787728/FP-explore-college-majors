4906704,5,B005Z4D2EC,"This was by far the favorite documentary I saw at SXSW 2011. I have been into punk music since I was a little kid and I always had a 'cool mom', so I could definitely sympathize with the kiddos in this documentary. Scenes of mohawked, studded, pierced and inked guys taking their kids to the playground, changing diapers... Fat Mike picking out an outfit with his decidedly diva little girl... these are some of the cutest, most heartwarming things you're likely to see out of these controversial and anti-authoritarian musicians. But more than the parenthood is being filmed here; Art from Everclear discusses his own distance and abuse due to his father's absence, and Duane Peters recounts the agonizing death of his teenage son, among other incredibly poignant and honest moments. These are more than just punk idols... they are real men with real problems, facing the trials and tribulations of raising children outside the box. A must-see for anyone who is a fan of any of the bands depicted within. The soundtrack is PHENOMENAL too... they use so much epic music throughout that a soundtrack would be like 3 CDs' worth of material!",1328054400,17,1138,4.871134020618556
4906705,5,B005Z4D2EC,I have to admit that I was not expecting much with this film but I was won over by its charm. It's great to see these musicians interacting with their kids (especially Flea from the Chili peppers). The movie is entertaining and watching these guys trying to balance their careers with their family life reveals a human side to these larger than life personalities. If you're a punk rock fan check out this movie. It's a nice insight into the softer side of the heroes you had on your wall and inside your binders in high school.,1328054400,,528,4.453608247422681
4906706,5,B005Z4D2EC,"Many people never take the time to think of rock stars on their life off the stage. The Other F Word explores this obscure topic, and specifically, fatherhood. In this touching, surprisingly heartfelt affair, we see some of our punk rock idols make the transition from tour life to home life. Overall, this is a very entertaining doc.",1327968000,2,334,4.775862068965517
4906707,5,B005Z4D2EC,"The viewer finally gets to see a lighter, softer side of these punk rock legends, as they enter parenthood. Combining a solid mix of humor and heart, this winning documentary really gives you a cool, alternate look at these normally aggressive rock stars. It's nice to see these gentlemen find out who they really are in life.",1327968000,2,326,4.7368421052631575
4906708,5,B005Z4D2EC,"Pre-ordered this and received it yesterday.  If you are a die hard Pennywise fan I STRONGLY recommend this along with Jim Lindberg's book Punk Rock Dad.  I got a little teary eyed and managed to laugh my face off.  You don't have to be a die hard punk rock fan to enjoy it.  Other band members are from Rise Against, Rancid, NOFX, Black Flag, Adolescents, Vandals, Blink 182 & even Tony Hawk.  Really enjoyed seeing this point of view of their lives.  Great soundtrack of course too ;).",1327968000,3,486,4.465909090909091
4906709,5,B005Z4D2EC,"Very real, very touching, very funny. It's punk rock, all grown up.... well, mostly :) This film is a great vehicle of sentiment for our youth and hope for our future. Loved every minute of it. Bravo to all the punk rockers who have figured out how to embrace their families without losing what they stand for.",1327968000,7,310,4.456140350877193

4906722,5,B005Z4D2EC,Honestly I watched this for the musicians... I watched it on father's day and was really moved to be a better father the back story of these musicians struggle to provide and be a good parent was inspiring and touching,1435449600,,218,4.475

4906726,5,B005Z4D2EC,"The Other F Word was a great movie featuring venerable punk rock fathers. Jim Lindberg of Pennywise fame, is the central figure in the film. However, many notable musicians appear with their children in the documentary-style-flick. Worth watching to see Fat Mike in his bathrobe making his toddler daughter toast.",1431648000,,313,5.28
4906727,5,B005Z4D2EC,Extremely powerful documentary.  Not enough of these focusing on fathers and divorce.  Really helped me get thru my divorce.,1431129600,,124,5.473684210526316

4906730,5,B005Z4D2EC,"If you're over 30 and grew up at punk shows you can't miss this movie. Lots of insight into riding the line between family man and music icon.

The soundtrack and editing alone make it worthwhile.",1424390400,,196,4.444444444444445

At least not the punk I grew up with.  When I think punk I think Sex Pistols, Government Issue and Black Flag to name a few.  Maybe the bands portrayed in this film are considered 'punk' to a younger generation, to each there own, but not to me.",1415577600,,398,4.642857142857143
4906735,5,B005Z4D2EC,I'm so glad i bought this. It made me see the cozy and vulnerable side of bands i like,1414454400,,86,3.5789473684210527
4906736,5,B005Z4D2EC,Love this movie! Interesting to hear their stories. Anyone who knows about these guys and their music should see this movie.,1411603200,,124,4.9523809523809526

4906738,3,B005Z4D2EC,"nice documentary about becoming an adult, accepting responsibility and wanting to be better parents, but the punk rocker performance style left me disgusted with that music (??) genre.  Yuk!",1410393600,,190,5.551724137931035
4906739,5,B005Z4D2EC,Its very cool to see my punk rock idols all grown up and putting their families first.,1409875200,,86,4.117647058823529
4906740,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I love pennywise but jim does not portray a very punk rock lifestyle at all.  This video should be about punk rock dads.  I think he's a great dad but I don't see his journey that much different from a basketball referee, gone half the year.  Duane peters, fat mike, Lars, they portray punk rock dads... And I'm not saying you have to be a loser.  But Jim's cookie cutter house, perfect wife, and 3 normal cheerleader type kids is just typical South Bay life style.",1408060800,,465,4.372093023255814
4906741,5,B005Z4D2EC,My husband was in a punk band when we met. Though I knew he loved us I also knew he struggled a bit off and on with the transition from how things were when we met to being a family man. This movie helped him realize that even some of the guys he looked up to at one point in time struggled with it but ultimately agreed that family and being there for their kids was most important. Great movie!,1405814400,,396,3.9625
4906742,4,B005Z4D2EC,"Great film that covers punk bands that I grew up with. You can relate to the artist especially if you have children. And if you do have children you may want to monitor them with this film. There's probably 70 ""F"" bombs in the 90 min or so of the movie. Over all I enjoyed this film!",1395446400,,283,3.982456140350877
4906743,2,B005Z4D2EC,"Everclear, Pennywise, & Blink 182 are punk bands now? Give me a break. Jocks in punk costumes talking about what it's like to be a dad now in a post-Nirvana world is sad. I'm sorry, but these dudes were all part of the problem. They are part of what made punk rock a commodity. And they created a new generation of kids that listened to formulaic watered down pop (albeit set to faster tempos) sold as ""revolution"". You can toss jokey-punk NOFX into that mix too. This isn't a bad concept for a documentary (thus the 2 stars), but Rancid was on the cover of Rolling Stone almost 2 decades ago at this point. You could've made a movie about rebellion growing up and fathering, but this wasn't it. Dig deeper.",1394409600,,707,4.404580152671755
4906744,5,B005Z4D2EC,"So many movies are all ""mom"" based. it's great to see things from a dad point of view. a must watch!",1382572800,,100,3.8095238095238093
4906745,3,B005Z4D2EC,"Fat Mike makes the movie. Stayed punk, even though he's a dad now. Duane too...couple of weird things, douch-y jock saying there's bands out there like Black Flag but Pennywise will always be the top punk band. Ahhh, without Black Flag there wouldn't even be a Pennywise, idiot. Next weird thing is why is the guy from Everclear even on this documentary? I don't mind Everclear, but they certainly don't fit in with the rest of the bands. Overall, o.k. movie, not the best in the world but cool concept.",1380672000,,503,4.6
4906746,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I happened to stumbled into a few punk rock shows in my teens but was never really into the music or the style. I was, however, angry and rebellious, so this film resonated deeply with my own experience of having to reconcile my teenage ideals (anti materialistic, anti authority, non conformity) with the realities of parenthood and family life. The documentary is sad at times and also uplifting as the featured artists transform their bad childhoods into a deep desire to give their children the family experience they wish they had had. I identified with this. The footage made me a little nostalgic for the days when consequences didn't matter, when I said F&@!$ YOU! to yuppies, wasn't afraid to fight with cops, or ride my skateboard drunk at night or do whatever the hell else I pleased. Fun times. If making pleasant and appropriate conversation with vapid parents at playgroups goes against every natural instinct you have, but you force yourself to be socially acceptable so that your kid can have friends, this film is for you. It will let you know you're not alone and will remind you why you do it.",1380153600,,1112,4.737113402061856
4906747,4,B005Z4D2EC,"great documentary.  enjoyed this.  funny to see these punk rockers grow into not only adults, but fathers!  glad i rented this.",1378080000,,127,4.9523809523809526
4906748,4,B005Z4D2EC,"Very well done documentary on dad's that are forces to be reckoned with in the punk scene. It showed how they are real people too and made them ""real"" human beings too. Would highly recommend and would love to see more documentaries like this one. Only thing I would say that would've made it better, was if it had just a few more of the major game players.",1375315200,,357,4.264705882352941
4906749,4,B005Z4D2EC,"It was interesting to be able to identify with these punk rock fathers.  A different look into what it's like to be a touring punk musician trying to also maintain a family balance.  For the most part these aren't the uber-rich superstars you might think of when you think of touring musician, just regular guys trying to make some dough doing the best they can to balance making money and providing for their families with staying true to their rebelious ideals all the while balancing the need to stay close with family while spending lots of time on the road.

I enjoyed it, although I'm not particularly fond of punk music, and some of the sections went a little too in depth for me into the mythos of the punk scene, I wanted more 'family time'.  There was almost too much punk hero worship/legend, but they kept a little more than enough real-life in there to avoid creating a hero-worshiping history lesson for punk enthusiasts.",1373587200,,935,4.648484848484848
4906750,5,B005Z4D2EC,"This film is a fun and touching look at the way a young man's life is absolutely turned on it's head by becoming a father.  The guys from a subculture defined by defiance of authority, becoming the authority, and realizing how much more to life there is makes a good story.",1371340800,,273,4.352941176470588
4906751,5,B005Z4D2EC,"This is a great gift for that 40 plus punk rocker dad. This shows a few major punk rock luminaries, musicians, singers, who are fathers. How they deal with life, a mortgage, gigs, and most of all thier CHILDREN!!!  Really good dvd.",1371340800,,231,4.5
4906752,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I was recommended by a friend to watch.  I felt it was a very well done story aboiut us middle aged punk guys.  I remeber at 15 thinking i would never live to 30.  Now a year off 40 and with 2 sons my outlook has really changed.  I still don't trust the estsablishent, i still want revolution, but i also nee to pay a mortgage, car payment and keep food on the table.  it is sooo weird to me still.. Being an outcast and having to intergrate into society is hard and this movie shows how har dit realy is.  It also shows haw we as parents need to be good parents.  I made my 15 year old watch this with me and he now has a greater appreication for what i went through growing up and why i am the way i am with him. One of the best lines of the film (its in the trailer too) is Jim Lindberg sayin (to paraphrae)- i thought i was going to change the world, now maybe i am by raising better kids!  I choked up at a few parts in the film, and i highly recommend this film to any parent, not just old punk rockers.",1370822400,5,1009,3.8405797101449277
4906753,5,B005Z4D2EC,"This documentary was great! I have been waiting for some time to watch it & as soon as I got the chance, I jumped. I loved it because you got to see the different sides of being a Punk and also being a dad & how to merge the two. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the Punk culture.",1370044800,,303,3.903225806451613
4906754,5,B005Z4D2EC,I found this movie extremely interesting because it reveals a side of the music that we don't usually stop to think about. How much a musician has to give up to keep up playing and entertaining their fans while their family has to wait for them to come back.,1369699200,,258,4.285714285714286
4906755,5,B005Z4D2EC,"This movie is great, it shows how we all have to grow up at some point.  There are just times when this movie really hits the point that  priorities change as you get older and have children. It's something that really changes your life, even for the hardest of the hard.",1367625600,,271,4.294117647058823
4906756,5,B005Z4D2EC,This movie was awesome... I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the music or not... Inspiring and heartwarming! With a little but of edge ;),1365638400,,144,4.576923076923077
4906757,5,B005Z4D2EC,The power of love transcends all.  It's really interesting to hear these guys look for it in Punk and then see it truly in kids.  They begin to see sacrificing their own life and time is where true love and hope is.,1365465600,,215,4.095238095238095
4906758,3,B005Z4D2EC,"Was excited at the prospect of seeing a movie that would dig deep into the conflict of punker vs. parent.  But this is more about how to balance being on the road and having a family. Could have been so much better.  Don't get me wrong, there's some good stuff, but would never buy.",1364083200,,282,4.203703703703703
4906759,4,B005Z4D2EC,This was a touching movie with a punk rock flare.  It was the perfect movie for the end of the week.,1363564800,,100,3.761904761904762
4906760,5,B005Z4D2EC,I was so taken by this doc. Touched on all my senses. It's actually pretty amusing. I was also surprised to some very emotional punk rock dads pour their hearts out about being brought up in broken homes..losing a child...it was very honest.,1363478400,,241,4.627906976744186
4906761,5,B005Z4D2EC,"As a teenage rebel turned father, and as a guy whose job is not entirely family friendly, this documentary really spoke to me.  All men who ever were once boys can relate to the dichotomy of our young and grown up selves.  I think there are so many great scenes in this, from Flea's breaking down admitting his kids gave him life, to the punk rock guy carrying his daughter down for breakfast and TV...he made breakfast.  We all wonder how we went from self-destructive children to responsible adults.  The answer is love for the family and children we create, and this documentary explains it in a perfect blend of frank yet poignant images.

If you are a woman trying in vain to understand your husband, or if you are a man trying to understand yourself, this is the first and probably best place to look.",1362182400,,807,4.5
4906762,5,B005Z4D2EC,This was a great movie. Nice to see the other sides to 'stars' and I recommend it to everyone interested in the lives of punk dads.,1359936000,,131,4.076923076923077
4906763,4,B005Z4D2EC,"I love all things documentary so I can usually find something to like about all of them.  This isn't a super deep crazy thought invoking documentary but it's still a good one.  An interesting look at an aging subculture.  I wasn't even a big punk fan in my day, but it's still interesting to see how different men have aged and how they view fatherhood.  The right amount of funny, touching sweet moments, a little bit of outrage and some sadness, just how I like it.",1358985600,,467,4.395348837209302
4906764,5,B005Z4D2EC,"As a former punker and current Dad, this was great. I was playing shows in San Diego when Blink was in High School. I was a few years younger than them. Long time ago. Anyway. Watched this with my wife who is not a fan of punk and she loved it. Solid movie all around. Funny, sad, moving, and very real.",1358812800,,303,3.9836065573770494
4906765,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I bought this without any expectations whatsoever, so I was thrilled when it turned out to be great.  The bulk of the video revolves aroung the X lead singer of Pennywise, who I generally think is a DB but as it turns out is a pretty good guy.  Down side, they throw just enough of Lars in there to get the Rancid fans.  I wish there was a lot more of him.",1357257600,,356,3.9166666666666665

4906769,5,B005Z4D2EC,"This movie not only showed our punk rock hero's doing what we know they do best on stage, It showed us a more human side to themselves.  The push and pull of having to raise a family and be away on tour can make it hard to find balance.  This movie shows all sides and how to find that balance and still be punk rock!  Well done!",1356307200,,329,3.8805970149253732
4906770,4,B005Z4D2EC,"I thought this was a great idea for a documentary and was sold on the trailer.

4906771,5,B005Z4D2EC,Great to see the other side of the scene I grew up in. Great movie! I would absolutely recommend it.,1354492800,,100,4.05
4906772,4,B005Z4D2EC,"This was actually a lot more touching than I thought it would be...it has the fun little moments you would expect and a good bit of musical substance, but there are some pretty personal moments in here, too. Definitely worth a look for anyone with a good taste in music and in interest in the behind the scenes ;).",1353542400,,314,4.338983050847458
4906773,4,B005Z4D2EC,I've seen these bands in concert but never thought about how touring may effet their loved ones. This is an interesting/entertaining look at how being an parent can be the best thing that can ever happen to you.,1348358400,,211,4.578947368421052
4906774,5,B005Z4D2EC,Totally recommend this to everyone.  My tattooed punk rocker husband especially liked it since we just had our son and this movie was really relatable to him.  Good movie,1347494400,,170,4.827586206896552
4906775,4,B005Z4D2EC,"Great movie for anyone, father yet or not, who grew up in the 90's listening to punk. This movies gets a good amount of modern punk icons talking about family and how it's changed them. Once again, I recommend it to anyone but especially to you Fathers out there.",1346889600,,263,4.387755102040816

4906777,5,B005Z4D2EC,Gifted this a couple of time to young dads I know who are doing their utmost to succeed where their dads may have not.  Cool grammas would like this too.,1346112000,,153,4.1
4906778,5,B005Z4D2EC,This DVD came in a timely manner. It is a really good documentary type movie. If you like most of these bands and have a family it is a list watch.,1345075200,,147,3.774193548387097
4906779,5,B005Z4D2EC,This movie is every bit as good as we thought it would be from the trailer. My husband and I were wild in our youth and now that we have a baby we have settled into our roles as parents yet we still see a lot of our friends with children up to the same nonsence that they were before they had kids. Its really nice to see all of these punk rock legends embracing their roles as fathers.,1344556800,,386,3.8987341772151898
4906780,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I laughed. I cried. I want to have a kid.  I now have respect for punk rockers.  Seriously, though, this was a really entertaining and informative documentary.",1341446400,,159,4.851851851851852
4906781,5,B005Z4D2EC,"Whether you like punk music or are a parent or just love really good documentaries, this movie made me laugh and cry and absolutely made me look at punk rockers in another light",1341446400,,177,4.393939393939394
4906782,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I'm going to (badly) paraphrase Jim Lindberg's words at the end of the film to give you a sense of it. ""Raising kids better than we got raised and being there for them is the punkest thing of all"". I agree with that statement completely! There are moments of laughter in this film- Jim wondering what his neighbors must think when they see him putting tobasco sauce on his dog's poop. Moments of charm- watching Flea and his daughter interact and hearing Art Alexakis talking about 'the switch' that kids can sense that happens in adults once you become a parent. There are heart breaking moments hearing Tony Be (Adolescent) and Duane Peters talk  about the loss of a child. There are some weird moments- watching Fat Mike put spray-able butter on toast for his daughter and Rob Chaos talking about... well, I'm not going to give that one up- you'll just have to see for yourself. I can't wait to see the bonus features which look pretty great. Even if you aren't into the music so much, I think there are some profound truths here and also enough funny moments to keep it from getting too bogged down that everybody can find something here that speaks to them. Kudos to the guys who participated and offered such insight and heartfelt feelings, kudos to the filmmakers, and kudos to Jim Lindberg, who's book sparked the idea to make this film! You all get big applause from this punk rock mom. (Now how about a punk rock mom documentary? Just kidding!)  ;)",1341446400,2,1458,4.582375478927203
4906783,4,B005Z4D2EC,"i just watched this.. i doubt ill ever buy it.. but i was emotionally touched by this. has a lot of guys who i have seen live and gotten drunk and gone to their shows all while i was younger. im 34 now.. and Pennywise was the 1st punk rock band i saw that i had the cd of.. this was 20 years ago.. before Unknown road came out.. while my tastes in punk rock have changed since i was 14.. my love for the music has not. and to see these guys, weather it was Flea, or Fat Mike.. be different from their own fathers.. which is what i strive to do for my own son, and not be what my father was. i guess this showed me on some level.. im doing right by my own child.",1340323200,,661,3.762589928057554
4906784,4,B005Z4D2EC,"It's so odd to see these fellows whom I've grown up listening to and admiring to really grow up. Granted, I am completely and utterly a fan of punk bands HOWEVER I can even see some who HATE the genre really enjoying this flick! It basically takes you on to a trip in a day of the life of a good handful of (mostly) california punk veterans. Also for those of you fossils out there who might not be into NOFX and Pennywise, you ll be pleased to know this features Ron Reyes and Tony Adolescent! Great success!",1334966400,2,509,4.204081632653061
4906785,5,B005Z4D2EC,"If you are a music fan or a father this movie is for you.  This movie is all about the family unit, fatherhood and responsibilities.  Some language issues but nothing your kid hasn't heard before.
I highly recommend this movie if you are between the ages of 30 and 50.",1332806400,2,268,4.34
4906786,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I went through my teenage years in 90's, as a punk, listening to most of the artists involved in this. The ""ANTI"" attitude comes with the territory. Eventually we grow up, and try to cling to that attitude, but it becomes less and less practical. I read, ""Punk Rock Dad: No Rules, Just Life"" shortly after my first son was born, and loved it. I've never ""LOL""ed so much to book. I wasn't sure what to expect when I heard this documentary was being produced, but I gave it a shot. It was funny and heart-felt, through and through. It was comforting to know I'm not the only person with conflicting convictions.

If you are (or were) a punker, and a parent... this is a GREAT buy.",1330905600,,678,4.338582677165355
4906787,5,B005Z4D2EC,This film was great!  I can honestly say I was smiling the entire time I was watching it.  It was a feel good documentary that gave incredible understanding what these musicians lives are like. I feel like I have learned some insight on parenthood.  The featured artists were so lovable.  I cannot say enough about this film. It is definitely worth the price.  I wish I could give more stars.,1330128000,,392,4.542857142857143
4906788,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I got this for my birthday. My wife went to see it in the theaters, but I could not attend. She told me I would love it and she was right! You get a sense, even if you were never a full-on punk yourself, of the reality of what these guys are dealing with. I think most guys my age (30-40) had a little bit of a punk attitude (F.U. I will do it because you told me not to) and this shows how hard it can be to reconcile that tendency with the realities of fatherhood.
Caution: this is a movie about punks... there are some 4 letter words... they play the entirety of Family Reunion by blink 182 (look it up if you don't know). So it's not for little kids and maybe not for the elderly. But all in all there is so much that hit home that I have to give it full marks. This will be a movie that is discovered by music fans and fathers for years and years to come! Great job!",1329350400,9,871,3.8715083798882683
4906789,5,B005Z4D2EC,"I've never been a fan of punk and probably never will be, but I loved this film.  It has so much to recommend it.  Seeing these guys trying to balance two very different, almost opposite, worlds was fascinating.  Also, as I said I've never been a fan of punk, but through this movie I have much better understanding of the music, the people who make it, and the people who are drawn to it.  Aside from being very entertaining it was very educational.",1328140800,4,450,4.385542168674699
8489427,4,B005Z4D2EC,"Funny and warm stories from mostly old school punkers. Unfortunately I wasn't into a lot of these major groundbreaking punk bands featured but loved seeing a few members (Art from Everclear!!---""Father of Mine"" was and still is my sad anthem). I really recommend it for anyone who suddenly got old (I'm only 31, but still, what happened!?) and had babies after being a rebellious teen who lived for not much more than music, shows and like-minded friends.",1505692800,,455,4.922077922077922
