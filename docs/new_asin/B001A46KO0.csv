3445534,3,B001A46KO0,"this film could have had more blob action, especially in 1st blob scene, in the cave, b/4 killin off this 1st person so easily; could a been a longer film, not so dark & nonsharp lookin. goog orig. film.

forget the 2nd film-non sharp vid. quality & they edit the 1 extra min. which is the best part of the film-when knife monster really finishes spacegoas off-only thin left was a body w/ 1 leg-hilarious.",1221523200,2,406,4.413333333333333

3445537,5,B001A46KO0,Caltiki is a cult movie a B film but fun filmed in Mexico a Blob type creature on the prowl it's a neat little film if your into cheap B films its for you ,1437264000,,155,3.5588235294117645

3445539,5,B001A46KO0,Great movie.,1431820800,,12,5.5
3445540,5,B001A46KO0,"I bought this for CALTIKI, which is hard to find anywhere else -- and Caltiki is a hoot.  Almost like a Mexican version of The Blob with some Aztec trappings thrown in.  The SFX are more than passable for a B-monster flick.  This is _not_ high art, but if you like low-budget monster movies, it's a very fun way to spend some time.  I haven't watched the Gamera movie on this disc, because there are excellent prints available of that film on both DVD and very inexpensive blu ray.  (That's the way to go for Gamera fans.)",1429920000,,522,4.34020618556701
3445541,4,B001A46KO0,"I bought this DVD only for 'Caltiki, The immortal Monster'. I'd seen 'Attack of the Monsters' a long time ago and never cared too much for it. When I watched Caltiki as a kid, it was a very different kind of blob movie than 'The Blob' with Steve McQueen. Darker atmosphere and much more graphic scenes of 'her highness' squeezing and dissolving the life out of her victims. She was a female of course. A Mayan deity who would destroy the world in conjunction with the arrival of a comet. Great stuff. Scared the stuffing out of me as a youngster.
And now that I'm an oldster, I try to look past the fact that the Mayan goddess sometimes looks like a bath towel soaked in oil and mud. Who cares?
So what if the English dubbing is a little out of sinc from time to time. It's about reliving a little of your childhood through these great old films, and I was fortunate enough to have had a great childhood, staying up late to watch these movies until my eyes were so bleary I could barely stay awake.
(no such thing as VCR's and recording things and all that back then) But as soon as the movie started to roll at about two in the morning I was wide awake, glued to the screen, with a little voice somewhere deep down inside, saying...""Alright, I'm ready. Scare me!""
And that big dark, pulsating blob on my television set did just that. No one touches 'her highness' and lives!",1427155200,3,1375,4.333333333333333
3445542,5,B001A46KO0,"great service, great value and hadn't seen movie since i was a kid on creature feature late show! came with a bonus feature which was ok, but loved seeing this again and was happy to add this to my collection!",1424822400,,209,4.25
3445543,4,B001A46KO0,"the quality of this dvd is fair , the picture is a little fuzzy ,but its ok . the sound is good ,and overall its good . i originally saw this movie at the drive in . and loved it . the monster was frightening , the men were brave,and the women were pretty ,(the woman that plays linda has heavily groomed eyebrows that make her look angry all the time ,,, so funny ) this movie is pretty rare ,and difficult to find . the other movie on the disc is a gamara movie witch i also like . this dvd is fun . 4 stars .",1423180800,,511,3.740740740740741
3445544,4,B001A46KO0,It has better picture quality than looking at it on you tube. I liked the creepy gruesomeness of it. Scared me for weeks when I saw it in the 60s on Chillers from science fiction show.,1422921600,,184,4.138888888888889

3445546,4,B001A46KO0,"Gave this to my brother, when he passed away I found it in the boxes he left me. Caltiki is our favorite monster blob movie. Took me forever to find it, glad I did my brother loved it.",1417478400,,184,3.8684210526315788

3445548,5,B001A46KO0,"WOW.....I have wanted to see CALTIKI again for the last 40 years.  I was 8 years old when I first saw it.  It is in black and white and just what you would expect, IF you are NOT looking for the new movies with computer graphics.  It has a great story line and a lot of substance.  Only watch this if you like high quality old horror black and white movies.  This definitely filled a void I have had, longing to watch this movie again......also, it is easy on the eyes and a quality copy!!!",1405123200,,490,4.11578947368421
3445549,5,B001A46KO0,"OK, I love old ""B"" grade b/w monster movies, and this is an old one. No real special effects here, but I still remember the first time I saw this film and it's fun to see it again just for the nostalgia and a little reprieve from ""Elysium"" (which is also a favorite.) Don't buy it unless you're a collector or an old movie buff (or just looking for a little bring-back-the-memories down time) If that's you, GO FOR IT!",1381449600,,418,4.2375
3445550,1,B001A46KO0,Purchased this from Amazon.  Disc WILL NOT PLAY on any DVD player that I own or that my friends own!!  DO NOT BUY!!!!,1375056000,,117,4.043478260869565
3445551,4,B001A46KO0,"I saw this movie as a young child many, many years ago, but never could find a copy as an adult.  I recalled it being very scary.  Well, on review, it's very cheaply done, but the story seems to carry the movie.  It's basically another 'blob' movie, but more graphically horrifying.",1367452800,,282,4.490196078431373
3445552,5,B001A46KO0,"This is a review of the Italian version from a distributor named DaaVeeDee, which more than once, has stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the park. I don't know if I should be angry that this took so long to find, or elated at the picture quality which can bring tears to your eyes. I was surprized to find that the disc runs on at least one of my NTSC players. It will fill your screen except for a moderate thickness band on the right side and a sliver on the bottom; if it is not the exact ratio it should be, it is very close. Contrast and sharpness are very good indeed and I can't imagine this material looking much better. As good a ""blob"" movie as there is with a better storyline then most, if you didn't know who Mario Bava was before, you will now. Look for the European cover with the close-up on the left and the woman on the right. Bravo DaaVeeDee! CLARIFICATION: I have since discovered, and purchased another version of this film. Reddish cover, green lettering, hand at top with reclining woman at bottom. Distributor names are Prestivo and Seven. Both reviews will remain in these pages for reasons which I hope will become evident.",1364774400,,1160,4.375
3445553,4,B001A46KO0,"I got this movie from Amazon a while ago, but I never got around to reviewing it. I remember seeing it at a drive in 1963. My Dad took me to see Gorgo, and Caltiki was the opening movie. Man, was I surprised! That scene with the diver just blew my 12 year old mind! I just about FLEW out of the car! LOL! It still holds up today, kudos to the make up artist.
This is obviously a VHS transfer, but it's good enough until they make a legit. It's a good story and decently acted. I believe it's a Latin American movie that never got the attention it deserved. If you like Horror movies, and never have seen Caltiki, you're in for a treat.",1351296000,3,635,4.0476190476190474
3445554,4,B001A46KO0,"I ordered this dvd as a gift, and the person receiving it was surprised that I was able to locate it for purchase. This movie is old, but it pleased the person I gave it to very much. I said ""Amazon has pretty much everything!"" Needless to say, I get requested from time to time to order other hard to find items. I have always been pleased by the quality of the items I have ordered from Amazon.",1320105600,,396,4.089743589743589
3445555,3,B001A46KO0,"DVD-R format is first strike against this DVD, second strike is the horrible cover. It is vastly underrated and hard to find, and has been claimed to be Mario Bava's first directorial effort. This is the greatest of all blob type movies with scenes of flesh dissolved from skelton. If only some DVD publisher would give it a proper release.",1301184000,4,340,4.683333333333334
3445556,5,B001A46KO0,"I first saw CALTIKI THE IMMORTAL MONSTER as a wide-eyed toddler. I watched in horror as the globular monster went on it's rampage! Today, about a million years later, I re-watched CALTIKI as an adult. I must say, that despite the hokey dialogue and hilarious dubbing, the monster itself is still quite impressive. Of course, it is cheeez-tastic, but that only adds to the overall fun. If you love monster movies, especially single-celled blob movies, then you can't go wrong w/ CAL'! Watch for the de-faced scuba diver, de-fleshed arm, and house-demolishing finale sequences! Great 50s stuff! Plus, there's the added feature, ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS- Titanic, friendly turtle, Gamera must battle a knife-headed beast, in order to save a pair of annoying children from cannibalistic alien gals. Great stuff indeed!...",1277942400,4,815,5.229007633587786
3445557,1,B001A46KO0,This release of Attack of the Monsters (Gamera vs. Guiron) is unauthorized and illegal. Buy the much higher quality version when it's out this September from Shout! Factory. Don't support movie pirates.,1275609600,3,202,5.34375
3445558,5,B001A46KO0,Great for the classic sci fi nut. B rated but a must have for the die hard vintage sci fi goer.,1263686400,,95,3.5714285714285716
3445559,1,B001A46KO0,"AS SOON AS I OPENED THE PACKAGE, I KNEW THIS DVD WAS A BOOTLEG COPY. EVEN THE RE-PRINTED COVER WAS AWFUL! AMAZON, YOU SHOULD BE MORE DISCRIMINATING....",1257465600,5,151,4.62962962962963
3445560,4,B001A46KO0,Caltiki is an old campy horror flick that my younger brother told me about about 45 years ago and actually scared me so much that I was afraid to see it - until now. I had a big laugh when I saw it. The movie's a lot of fun and the quality of the DVD is great considering the age of the movie and the fact that it is so hard to find. It brought back great memories of a simpler time and my dear brother.,1256860800,9,403,3.697674418604651
3445561,4,B001A46KO0,"I saw this on TV in the 1960s, when I was about 5 years old.  It gave me horrendous nightmares.  I rented a copy of it not long ago, expecting to laugh at the cheesiness of the special fx and my childhood gullibility.  Instead, I found myself understanding why it stayed with me all these years -- the special effects are eerie and still frightening, and the premise was at least as plausible as any monster movie premise gets.  It was a fun trip down memory lane.",1252800000,19,464,4.2988505747126435
3445562,4,B001A46KO0,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a child around 11 years old and I tell you this movie scared me to death.
It has been in the back of my mind for years and I have always wondered about seeing it again because of course it won't be played anywhere now.
I am so thankful for the internet, Amazon, etc... to allow people like me to be able to obtain obscure movies like this- to relive it. Even if now I see it, I would cringe!  But I have to get it now!",1246924800,10,458,3.8210526315789473
3445563,4,B001A46KO0,"Pretty decent print of CALTIKI, especially since my vhs copy is so dark as to render viewing almost impossible. Now the voice sync is off a fraction of a second during the last third of the movie, but loving this kind of schlock it's no big deal, at least not to me.
Fans of Euro-Trash cinema may identify Caltiki-crazed explorer Gerard Herter ( he's the guy who loses both his hand and his mind to Caltiki ) as a vetern of Spaghetti Westerns playing arrogant Prussian/German types in THE BIG GUNDOWN and ADIOS SABATA. He was also ( cast the same ) in the Steve Reeves adventure THE WHITE WARRIOR.
This is great Blob-style stuff in b&w from an era that produced so many enjoyable cheap thrills. The ending with Caltiki consuming the house, threatening the wife and child of the hero only to be destroyed by the Mexican army's flame-throwers is a very satisfactory example of classic B-movie Monster mayhem...it excited me when I saw it on tv in the early 60's and it brought back fond memories.
You can buy this...it is very watchable, other than the slight sync problem. The disc does not skip or freeze. The image is a vast improvement over the vhs dupe I bought some 15 years ago.
Also, as a bonus is a version of ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS, the Gamera fan favorite also known as GAMERA VS. GUIRON (1969) in which two boys are taken captive by alien space babes. It's a kid's film and is in color, and though the color isn't sharp and pristine, it's very acceptable and the little tykes in your household will love it...All in all, a very good double-bill buy!
Both films are in full screen.
I'm happy with this purchase.

p.s.....just a reminder that the soundtrack to CALTIKI is available on cd through a company called SCREEN ARCHIVES. Check out their website if interested.",1243209600,32,1776,4.55
3445564,1,B001A46KO0,"This is not a studio released copy it is a DVD-R with a sticker type label.
I have no clue how this got on Amazon since I have always known them to be a reputable company that do not sell questionable material.
The quality is bad and the dialog sound to actual mouth movements sync is way off.
I am going to return it.",1226016000,17,318,3.984375
8275931,1,B001A46KO0,"It quit playing on multiple format. My DVD player says ""nothing recorded"".",1497398400,,74,5.25
8275932,1,B001A46KO0,"For some reason I missed this piece of garbage when it played the holiday weekend midnight movie marathons at the local drive-in all those years ago. I'm glad I did. A rampaging foreskin devours some woeful actors, shoves its way through a poorly constructed balsa wood set, and is about to ""roll up"" a ladder to get the 'hero', his love interest and a snotty nosed little brat (all star graduates from the Tor Johnson School of Wooden Acting).
The miniatures were abominable - no-one connected to this flick back in the late 50s took any pride in what they were doing.
It must have been bad as the original director ran off leaving a young Mario Bava to tie the leftovers together and make something out of it.
He failed, too.
The second feature - Attack of the Monsters - ran for a paltry 16 minutes before the disc refused to play any more.
Cannot understand why I spent $20 buying this rubbish. It wasn't even funny...",1492041600,,922,4.494047619047619

8275934,4,B001A46KO0,"I bought this DVD only for the film Caltiki, the Immortal Monster, an Italian-made English-dubbed black and white late 50's/early 60's flick.  A scientific expedition, exploring Mayan ruins discovers a blobish monster that infects one of the scientists and goes on a rampage, destroying all in its path.  The other feature is a Japanese-made English-dubbed color Gamera film from the mid-60's.  It features two of the silliest movie monsters to come out of Japan.  This film was also given the MST3K treatment.  Catch that if you can.  The quality of the DVD is only OK.  Caltiki is rather dark, but then it was filmed that way.  The second film's color is a little faded and is not sharp or very clear but it is watchable.  Both films need  re-mastering.  Otherwise not bad.  Recommended for the first film.",1468022400,,808,4.817518248175182
8275935,4,B001A46KO0,"It's rare for me to come across an old monster movie I'd never seen before, and even more rare for that movie to be worthwhile.  I saw brief clips of Caltiki online and it looked interesting.  The movie did not disappoint, with fairly good acting, a reasonable plot and special effects far better than I was expecting.  The model work was excellent, as was the monster.  Caltiki was a bit more gruesome than other monster movies of the time, and the only extra is the film trailer, but it's still a good addition to my film library.

The second movie, Attack of the Monsters, was intended for small children despite the copious amounts of monster blood spilled.  There was poor acting, bad writing and a weak monster design.  The first movie was my reason for buying, so I'm not going to drop the rating.",1463961600,,804,4.541666666666667
8275936,4,B001A46KO0,"Certainly a B movie or even maybe a C.  But, I remember seeing this as a kid and it rattled my beejeevers.  The sound and visuals are out of sync as the movie goes on but still quite watchable.  I liked it a lot.  Takes me back many years.  Worth getting especially if you are a collector or old sci fi movies.",1462147200,,310,3.935483870967742
