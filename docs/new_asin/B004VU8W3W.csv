The story begins in the early 19th century. A Caribbean island has sugar plantations. The native Indians were exterminated, slaves were brought from Africa to raise this lucrative product. Sir William Walker arrives from England. He passes a code word to another man. A rebel is executed, his head will be on display as a warning. Walker talks to the dead mans wife and asks about his friends. We learn about their class system. [Some brutality here!] Religion provides solace for some and a meeting place for others. Walker plans to rob a bank while the colonialists are otherwise occupied. Then they will sail away. A fire breaks out, the bank is robbed, a nosy soldier is neutralized. Can the villagers help them? Now is the time to act. They do. The villagers now own flintlock muskets, and are free (for now). What will happen when a larger force comes? Jose Delores plans to stay in the village.

Walker discusses economics with a group of planters. Do they want freedom of trade with their independence? What if their workers want to become masters? Walker offers a deal, acting for the British government. The people begin a celebration in the town square. Is there a secret plan to revolt? The governor is assassinated, the people attack the soldiers. The planters announce a revolution. Armed people walk along the beach. Walker explains the reason for British help: Portugal is an enemy. General Delores meets the new President who abolished slavery. They need a new constitution now. A commercial agreement is needed to sell the stored sugar now. Walker explains the need for British support. Go away. What next? Walker will be sent to Indo-China. Ten years later the sugar companies prosper. Two men look for Walker in London to offer him money to return to Camargey.

Back in Camargey he meets President Sanchez as a military advisor. The rebel army was disarmed. The Royal Sugar Company runs the country. An uprising by the sugar cane workers is put down. Jose Delores is the leader again. The rulers offer equal rights and better wages to put down the revolt. Walker rescues one man from a firing squad and sends him as a messenger to Jose Delores. This offer is refused emphatically. Walker plans to defeat Jose Delores and his band by attacking the small villages in the Sierra Madre mountains. The woods are set afire to remove any shelter. The troops find bodies in the hills, but the rebels escaped. More villages will be attacked and destroyed, men are shot.

Bread is given to the survivors. British soldiers land to support the new Provisional Government with their cannons. Burning sugar cane fields drives out the rebels, who are promptly shot down. This also destroys the sugar cane. Where will it end? This destruction is only temporary. Jose Delores is captured alive and speaks to the soldiers. Walker says this problem is not his fault. What to do with Jose Delores? Walker meets Jose and tries to free him. Why? The next day Walker rides away to return to England. But a porter meets him and delivers a message. And so this story ends.

This European movie has unusual brutality and does not meet the expectations of many; its ending is realistic rather than pleasant. Its appeal is educational as a fictionalized case study of colonialism in the 19th century. You could probably find similar examples in South American history. The British were the major investors in Argentina and other countries. They bought beef, wheat, wool, and other agricultural products. They sold manufactured goods and wool clothing.",1400803200,,3576,4.865353037766831
