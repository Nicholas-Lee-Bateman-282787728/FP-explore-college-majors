The only thing I would have liked was a more in depth 'Making Of' but maybe that's just me. As the DVD stands it's well worth the money. Excellent.",1285545600,,406,4.8
8148017,4,B000IZJSUA,"Don't get me wrong; I enjoy adult-themed cartoons like Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Freak Show as much as the next childish man-geek out there, but sometimes I just need a fix of a fun-lovin', kid-friendly toon that embraces wacky hijinks and ape-based antics instead of the usual heaping serving of sexual innuendos and hackneyed hipster 80s allusions. Family Pants, the popular webtoon now on DVD, is just the change of pace I was looking for. Animator and director Dave Redl does a bang-up job of presenting your standard animated family dynamic -- oblivious dad disrupts the day with harebrained schemes, insane inattention to detail and in this particular feature, a bad attempt at a simple task (fixing a hole in the roof) -- and adds in a memorable cast of characters that includes a scene-stealing animal.

Father Frank is joined by his voice-of-reason wife, peace-loving hippie son and a very large, shot-putting champion daughter who would make Brook Hogan look petite (no, I swear!). Frank's partner in crime is a taciturn silverback gorilla named Gruno, who never understands what his human pal is saying but attempts to do his bidding nevertheless.

Redl embraces his fondness for early Looney Tunes and other classics by presenting his modern family of Germanic origin (nice touch) in an angular yet comfy throwback environment -- with Honeymooners-esque voices and dialogue, extremely dated decor (replete with a sweet cable box) and a jazz-infused rhythm reminiscent of sublime 60s-era toonage. This movie is packed with just the right amount of miscommunication, nuttiness and non sequiturs (chick-filled dune buggies, repairmen clowns, guys in chicken outfits) and innocence that would make fans of the old guard like Fred and Bugs and new kids like Homestar Runner and Strong Bad very happy. Also check out the commentary by the creators, they give a nice insight into creating cartoons and its colorful history.",1165708800,,1929,5.159744408945687
