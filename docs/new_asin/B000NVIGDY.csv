--------------------------------------------------

After getting burned on so many budget DVD releases of The Beverly Hillbillies, The Andy Griffith Show, and Petticoat Junction due to the replacement music, I really lucked out when I picked this up yesterday at Walmart for 5.00.

The quality could be better - I noticed some compression artifacts on the side of the mansion when I quickly checked out the first few episodes - but for the price, number of episodes, and MOST IMPORTANTLY the original theme music, it's WELL worth it!  Of course, a die-hard fan should buy the two ""Ultimate Collection"" volumes and ""The Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Ultimate Christmas Collection"" disc, in order to get all of the public domain episodes and a TON of extras - albeit for about fifty bucks in total; but for the casual fan, this set is the best single item you can purchase.

This set includes 40 black & white episodes on 4 discs, and they're all in chronological airdate order (for the full list, see AlphaControl's review of this item).  As I stated in my review title, the original theme music is used in ALMOST all episodes.  Only two episodes don't use the original music:

* ""No Place Like Home"" uses replacement music and the titles are in progress, starting at ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" title screen and leaving out the ""shooting at food"" scenes beforehand.  Since replacement music is used, I have no problem with cutting the full opening sequence.

* ""Elly Needs a Maw"" doesn't have any beginning titles at all.  However, it's missing on another disc I have, so maybe all copies of this episode leave out the beginning title sequence - though they could have tacked one on from another episode.

I should also note that the theme song starts a few seconds late in the episode ""Christmas at the Clampetts"", though at least it's the original music!

I don't know if I got a bum copy, but the ""Pygmalion and Elly"" episode on Disc 1 won't play.  When I try to view it, my player stops.  If this defect exists in all copies, then technically there are only 39 episodes on the disc, and this episode should be added to the list of missing episodes below.

I tried the DVD in four different players, and the episode didn't play in any of them.  Mill Creek was kind enough to send me a replacement set and that one also had the same problem.  This is the only Mill Creek DVD I have that I've had a problem with - and I have about a dozen of their sets.

From what I've read, all 36 season one episodes and the first 19 season two episodes are in the public domain, which means that only 15 public domain episodes are missing from this set.  Although it would be better if this were a six disc set and included those remaining episodes, all things considered, that's a fairly small number of episodes to be missing.  For the record, these are the missing 15 episodes (excluding the two that need original music and/or beginning titles, and the one that wouldn't play on any of my DVD players):

2784745,5,B000NVIGDY,"Mill Creek puts out an excellent product.  I own numerous ones.  Their prices are always low, but the quality never is.  This particular set is no exception.  40 episodes on four DVD's!  Each episode is going to set you back a whopping 20 cents or so!  I have great confidence in the Mill Creek name.  Give them a try and I'm quite certain you'll be singing their praises as well.",1216080000,,380,4.3428571428571425
2784746,5,B000NVIGDY,My nephew got a kick out of these old episodes.  They're loads of fun to watch!,1214265600,,79,3.9375
2784747,5,B000NVIGDY,"We picked this set up at a bargain price because we thought it would be harmless video entertainment for our kids (ages 5 and 9). What a treat! The 9-year-old thinks they're hilarious, and we parents are finding them more entertaining than we remembered. Wholesome and funny. The video/audio quality is perfectly acceptable, with lots of episodes (40!). Recommended for anyone who enjoys old comedies, but especially for families looking for DVDs they won't have to worry about their kids seeing alone.",1205107200,,502,5.134146341463414
2784748,5,B000NVIGDY,"4 disks. 40 episodes and original theme song. when i saw this for 5.00 at walmart i thought i was ""shooting at some food"" and had hit GOLD! (if not oil!) make some popcorn and enjoy.",1204329600,,182,4.083333333333333
2784749,4,B000NVIGDY,its always wonderful to see the frist episode or pilot of a tv series if you missed it first came out!! over all quality was good and also having the lead in theme song and ending credits was great,1200528000,2,197,4.076923076923077
2784750,5,B000NVIGDY,"I liked this collection because it strikes a balance between content, quality and price when compared to all the other Beverly Hillbillies DVD collections out there.

The video/audio quality if fair to good.  Some eps are better than others but all are quite watchable. The opening/closing theme music, missing on most bootlegs, are present here. There are 40 black and white episodes from the first two seasons on four discs, all contained in one compact case.

There are no extras but you get nearly all the episodes in the Ultimate Collections (Vols 1 and 2), plus the seasons one and two Christmas episodes.  Diehard fans will no doubt buy the Ultimate Collections and the separate Christmas DVDs (for several times the price of this one set) in order to get the extras, a couple more episodes, and only slightly better video/audio quality.

As a more casual fan of this show, I was more than happy with this budget collection.  Here are the episodes included:

2784793,4,B000NVIGDY,"But overall, I enjoy it very much. Some of the shows contained herein, have very poor video quality (too light and diminished sound). But considering the price I paid for total number of episodes I got, I would buy it again.",1402963200,,224,4.487804878048781

2784795,2,B000NVIGDY,The quality of the picture is very poor.  Best stick to getting one from Paramount studios.  This one was only worth the $5 I paid for it.,1358812800,,138,4.074074074074074

2784797,5,B000NVIGDY,"I remember when I was a kid how funny this show was. As you get older, some things you thought were GREAT are no longer. This series is timeless. I laugh every bit as hard as I did in the past and every show begins with the theme song. This is one of the all time funniest shows ever and you won't be disappointed.",1354147200,,314,3.921875
2784798,5,B000NVIGDY,Good family fun that leaves you wanting more! The only negative was not in the dvd but the fact the case arrived damaged. Other than that no complaints..,1351641600,,153,4.5
2784799,5,B000NVIGDY,"This dvd is well worth the money. But be warned that the episode Pygmalion and Elly is not on the dvd. Must be a defect when dvd was pressed that that episode did not transfer onto disk. Other than that, this dvd will deliver hours of laughter!!",1327276800,,245,4.23404255319149
2784800,1,B000NVIGDY,"this dvd is too hard too watch.  save your money and watch your VHS tapes, the picture and sound will be better.  i do Not think you should buy this.  I'm a fan of the show but this dvd version is a digrace. cheaply done.",1304035200,2,221,3.8666666666666667
2784831,5,B000NVIGDY,I also got this for my husband he likes it alot.  I also like it I like Granny.  I could and would love to live in the hills.,1303084800,,125,3.4285714285714284
2784832,5,B000NVIGDY,After all this time I finally watched this part of the first season I fell asleep while watching It must have played for hours. I thought It was just various episodes but I think It all 4 seasons starting from the first season. This also has the original theme Song starting from I think the 3rd episode.,1297123200,,304,4.350877192982456
2784833,5,B000NVIGDY,This was exactly what I expected. Brand new and excellent quality. It also arrived much faster than expected. I would definitely buy from this seller again.,1295049600,,156,5.038461538461538

2784835,4,B000NVIGDY,"I bought this set because of the dollar value to episodes. There are quite a few episodes I had never seen before.  The quality of the transfer to dvd isn't as good as desired.  But then maybe the quality of the filming wasn't so great back then, either.  Anyway, there were two episodes on disc one that wouldn't play.  Not too bad for forty episodes.",1289779200,,352,4.369230769230769
2784836,4,B000NVIGDY,"This is Carol Butler's son writing this review.  I bought this set at Wal*Mart for $5.00 in the bargain bin.  When I saw the price, I immediately picked it up.  Then once I got home, I thought ""did I waste more money on a terrible set?"", but I was wrong.  I hadn't.  When I put the first DVD in, much to my surprise was the original theme song, which made me happy.  Then I thought, ""well, that's just the one episode so far, let's try the others.""  All but one episode in the whole set had the original theme song.  I was very happy with the purchase.

Some of the episodes are a bit blurry, but for only $5.00, you can't get much better.  There are no special features, unless you consider having the original theme music a special feature on public domain episodes, which I do.

Overall, a very good collection of 40 public domain episodes for a very good price.  I will definitely be buying more from the company who produced this set (Mill Creek Entertainment).  They do classic TV right!",1276560000,,993,4.360655737704918
2784837,3,B000NVIGDY,"Given the level of humor, I wonder why I loved ths show and why I still can watch it with some amusement.  Perhaps it's because the plots, so incredibly obvious, were based upon the simple premise that the hillbilly's did not know modern civilization.  So, we thought ourselves better than them(at least).  Of course, the show had a subtle message...ok, they have a lot to learn, but they also had a heart and a sincerety to them that was endearing and rock solid.  So, in the end, could we depend upon them to show character or the modern day(for the time) Angelenos that they met?
This collection was so inexpensive for me to get, less than $8 for over 1,000 minutes of shows, that I couldn't refuse.",1274486400,,702,4.503937007874016
2784838,5,B000NVIGDY,I loved this DVD.  Most of the episodes were not remastered but the quality was not bad and it was a bargain.,1270857600,,109,3.9545454545454546
2784839,2,B000NVIGDY,"I bought this DVD, thinking that I probably made a mistake, and I was right. It has 9 classic episodes, plus the pilot episode as an added bonus. There is one problem: The bonus episode does not play in any DVD player I have, not even on my computer. I knew it looked like a cheap DVD, bought I wanted to see if I was right, because I know that looks can be deceiving. Not this time. It could be that I got a bad DVD, but it would probably be the best idea not for you to not buy this DVD.",1246752000,4,489,3.803921568627451
2784840,3,B000NVIGDY,"SO, for 7.99, it is a pretty good collection of shows.  The gripes I have range from the poor pixelation ( and I am by no means an expert or even picky to this usually) I own a bunch of old tv show series and none of them have the poor pixelation that this series does.  Also, the sound and dubbing is pretty messed up on various episodes.  I also wish that a few of these episodes had been the color versions.  In the end, however, this is a good collection of great classic television for 7.99!",1234742400,,496,4.082474226804123

8181841,5,B000NVIGDY,Another good old comedy,1495497600,,23,5.0
8181842,4,B000NVIGDY,"This set is billed as the ""Best of the Beverly Hillbillies"" and I have to agree on the episode choices. However, as much as I am really enjoying this set, I need to give it only four stars due to the picture quality of a number of episodes. Some epsodes were so blurred the cast lists at the end were barely readable. This being an early dvd release, I would recommend getting one of the recently released sets that has been restored. While this set has the 40 best episodes, it would be well worth paying more for the new releases. Also be sure you are ordering a new set...I didn't notice I bought a used set, which I have only knowingly done once...for a set that was out of print.",1481241600,,684,4.229007633587786
