7959460,5,B000063K0Q,"A rare gem from 1992 about Police and crack-dealers from Brooklyn projects.  The film reminded me very much of Brooklyn's Finest (2009), which also takes place in Brooklyn projects and concerns a group of NYPD cops.  In the Line of Duty: Street Wars is a brutal film, that I think perfectly captures the late 1980's and early 1990's New York (or the borough of Brooklyn).  Most actors and actresses here are of African-American heritage, with exception to two supporting actors playing detectives, who happen to be white.  If you are a fan of African-American/black cinema and like action/drama flicks this one is a must see.

Also, if you like this film I highly recommend watching Juice (1992) with Tupac Shakur.",1437955200,,714,4.916666666666667

7959463,5,B000063K0Q,"Most police flicks are told from the prospective of white police officers. This one is told from a different view. The prologue is very true and not often spoken about. Overall, a good movie.",1326153600,,191,4.647058823529412
7959464,5,B000063K0Q,"""In The Line of Duty: Street War"" or ""Urban Crossfire"" is a well-made TV movie.

The plot is: Officers Raymond and Robert (Mario Van Peebles and Michael Boatman) are going after Justice Butler (Courtney B. Vance) an evil drug dealer. Unfortunately, Raymond gets killed by him. Now Robert wants revenge. Butler escapes and now Robert and Detective Reilly (Peter Boyle) have to catch him before he commits more crimes.

The acting is good with Peter Boyle and Courtney B. Vance standing out. The writing and directing is standard. No surprises in this story. Overall, it's worth seeing for the acting. One of the director's other movies ""The FBI Murders"" is also recommended.",1224028800,4,673,5.0
