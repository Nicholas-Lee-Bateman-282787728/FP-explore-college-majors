461487,3,6302428149,"... this British horror film shot in March/April of 1933 and released in October of that same year isn't quite up to snuff.  Karloff plays Egyptologist Professor Morlant, who believes that, if at the first full moon following his death, his soul brings a jewel called The Eternal Light to the god Anubis, he will be rewarded with eternal life.  When Morlant dies, the jewel is bandaged to his left hand and his body is entombed with the statute of Anubis.
But his servant (played by Ernest Thesiger, later of ""Bride of Frankenstein"") steals the jewel and, when Morlant awakes (the shot of his arm reaching straight up into the air from the sarcophagus is most striking) and finds the jewel missing, he breaks out of his grave, murdering a few people (I think - the way the strangulation scenes are shot, Karloff's efforts seem weak, and after awhile the victims get back up again) until he finds his jewel.
Karloff isn't allowed many lines or chances to redeem this minor picture.  His character dies quickly in the beginning (though his death scene is impressive, with the actor's pantomime skills and broken speech well suggestive of a dying man, not to mention a great-looking make-up job), so you never get to know him.  Once he comes back to life, he utters not a word, just staggers around chasing after his jewel.
There is a running attempt at humor in the form of a female friend of the heroine, who is fascinated by an Arab who also wants to lay his hands on The Eternal Light.  He orders her around and she loves it, but the scenes and the humor stick out like a sore thumb and lack the amusing touch of director James Whale (""The Ghoul"" was directed by T. Hayes Hunter, whom several in the cast apparently disliked).
As Paul Jensen notes in his book, ""Boris Karloff and His Films"", ""The Ghoul"" merely becomes ""a variation on the familiar reading-of-the-will eccentric household, non-supernatural melodrama"" and not a very memorable one at that.  One does, however, get to see a VERY young Sir Ralph Richardson - he plays the local vicar, Nigel Hartley, who has his own interest in the jewel.

Very few Karloff fans own this forgotten gem, and almost no one has ever seen it.  History reported the print had turned to dust, when one final nitrate was found in a janitor's closet in 1968. Only two rare video releases of ""The Ghoul"" have ever been available, and this is the better print.  The picture quality is uneven, and sometimes the sound drops out, but anyone who loves the Karloff canon will want to own this ""Lost Film"".  Karloff plays a demented Egyptologist who defends his sacred Scarab gem with a curse to return from the dead.  The story builds to a eerie, fiery climax that you will want to watch again and again.  Lovers of film lore get a peek at Ernest Theisiger, the famous Sir Ralph Richardson{as a vicar}, and perhaps the earliest film entrance of Sir Cedric Hardwicke(very nasty}.

Karloff, of course, does a fine job as the eponymous monster, but his excellent performance is wasted in the overall malaise of the film.  The plot unfolds at a snail's pace and practically nothing of any interest happens all the way through.  The cinematography is quite good and the movie looks fine, but even so what could have been a very eerie atmosphere is dissipated by the tepid plot and a great deal of attempted humor.  The fact that the ""hero"" is a rude, well-heeled brat doesn't help matters either.  Lacking chills, suspense, or a consistent atmosphere, THE GHOUL is a sub-par entry in the Karloff repertoire.",1445817600,,741,4.7578125

461599,3,6302428149,"B- movie

This movie hails from the early 1930's, when mummies were...king.  As bad as that pun might be, I would say it was quite fitting for THE GHOUL.  It's not that the movie was bad, exactly, but there are a number that were much better from this time and the next decades.

Others have given good plot summaries, so I'll take a different approach.

PROs
- A different mix of horror and ""crime drama"", especially for its time
- Some intentional British humor, dry but still worth a smile occasionally
- Did they really intend to imply an impending incestuous relationship between the lead cousins? :-)

CONs
- Really weak ending.  (No spoilers)
- Poor video and audio reproduction (instant video format)
- Villains weren't really villainous for horror, really just crooks or frightened of death
- Did they really intend to imply an impending incestuous relationship between the lead cousins? :-)

Personally, I think the acting was at best adequate.  Others have commented on how good it was.  Mostly, I thought it was a mix of wooden and excessive, depending on the scene.  The best performance, to me, was the manservant, Lang, played with a mix of realism and excessiveness by Ernst Thesiger.  Karloff and Hardwicke both gave weak performances, imho.",1425081600,,1258,4.854460093896714
461600,2,6302428149,"I am a big Karloff fan, and had never seen The Ghoul, so I expected this Amazon video to be a treat.  I was quite disappointed, however. Karloff and a fine cast (Ernest Thesiger, Ralph Richardson, Cedric Hardwicke, and Kathleen Harrison) are given little to work with. The film is slow paced, grim, and talky, and not very scary.  It starts out as something along the lines of 'the Mummy,' which would have been fine, but it turns out that it has no real supernatural content at all.
Also, the video quality is extremely poor, and the fact that we see end credits for Vincent Price's 'House on Haunted Hill' (a much more suspenseful film, by the way) at the beginning of the video leads me to believe it may have been videotaped directly from a tv screen.

461626,5,6302428149,"This movie owes a lot to The Old Dark House (1932), also starring Karloff and the inimitable Ernest Thesiger.  In this case, a sad old geezer (Karloff) hopes to cheat death by handing over a jewel called The Eternal Light to a statue of Anubis that he keeps in his bedroom.  No one is awfully keen on him doing this, especially his servant (Thesiger) who fails to bury the bauble with his master.  Karloff's character (a professor of Egyptology) is interred without being embalmed (or checked to see if he was actually dead).  After that, it's a matter of bauble, bauble, who's got the bauble as several interested parties try to lay claim to it, including a slightly miffed Karloff who storms out of his tomb to find it.  There's also a shady barrister (Cedric Hardwicke) willing to kill to get his hands on the jewel, along with a suspicious `vicar' (Ralph Richardson) who keeps popping up with surprising regularity, not to mention several other intense jewel hunters.  For good measure, a couple of cousins show up at the spooky old house expecting their inheritance.  They drag with them a dithering ninny (Kathleen Harrison) who supplies most of the comic relief.

Karloff gets one great faux dying scene then spends the rest of the movie mute, stumbling around in a rage, trying to strangle anyone he can get his hands on.  This movie manages to be an exciting and fun frolic, instead of being scary.  It's lovely in black and white, everything gloomy and stark.  At one point there's people following people following people in an effort to find the elusive jewel.  My only complaint is that it tended to be a tad too funny at times, which was not in keeping with its title or the claim of horror.",1414281600,,1705,4.6466666666666665

As for plot...Karloff strives for eternal life through his belief in ancient Egyptian mysticism. He dies, is buried...and returns to mete out mystical justice to those who have betrayed him. So much for the plot.

What's really outstanding here is the spot-on understanding of the horror genre at this period of time (1933), taking the best from DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, THE OLD DARK HOUSE and especially THE MUMMY and melding it all together into a successful formula for fright fans.

Unfortunately this film somehow disappeared through the years and was considered lost. It's never gotten it's fair due as a horror classic, being a film more read about than seen. And, hopefully it's not too late to make things right, as it's a real corker.

All of the cast give exceptional performances, right down to the sixth & seventh billed, bit parts included.
The overall ""look"" of the film is classic 1930s, in the then UNIVERSAL style, with outstanding set design.
The photography is striking, capturing foggy London and the marshy estate at their gothic best.

All in all, a valuable and much appreciated horror release from the early 1930s, presented in a pristine restored print for mere peanuts (usually for under 10 bucks).

I urge you to buy THE GHOUL now before this item eventually becomes deleted and the cost soars to +$$$$$$ for anyone to be able to enjoy this classic.

461666,3,6302428149,"Actually I'd give this one about 2.5/5 stars, I'm just rounding up rather than down.

The atmosphere is perfect, and the idea behind the film is one that seems tailor-made for Karloff. A dying professor of Egyptology spends his entire fortune to obtain a jewel that has the power to give him eternal life. The jewel must be in his left hand at the time the first full moon passes over his coffin resting in its crypt. When this happens, according to legend, the dead man will rise from the grave. He then places the jewel in the open hand of an idol. If the idol's hand closes over it, the holder is accepted into eternal life.

The dying man is, of course, played by Karloff. Better yet, the servant, Liang, who agrees to bandage the dying professor's hand with the jewel inside, is played by Ernest Thesiger whose bony visage was made for these old 30's horror films. Unfortunately, the professor's servant is not too terribly honest, and removes the jewel from the dead man's hand before burial. Complicating matters is an Egyptian believer in the ancient religion who is trying to retake the jewel for spiritual reasons, and a nephew of the late professor who wants to know why his uncle spent his entire fortune on one ring. Other assorted characters also stir the pot.

The problem with this entire film is that the wonderful Karloff and Thesiger disappear from it after about the first 20 minutes and the middle part is stuffed with a casserole of characters none of which I could bring myself to care about. Their association with the central theme of the plot as well as with each other is a muddle, and essentially nothing happens for the next 45 minutes. An hour after the movie is over you'll have forgotten all of these people except Karloff and Thesiger. The last 15 minutes picks up a bit as far as action and interest, but the resolution is ridiculous.

If you want to see a film of a similar stripe watch 1932's ""The Old Dark House"".

There are some old movies we watch because they are brilliant examples of the filmmaker's art, movies that broke new ground in technique or showcase brilliant performances; movies from which we derive pleasure at least in part because these movies are in some way important. And then there are old movies we watch for the sheer pleasure of seeing something so cheesy that you really can't believe, through your fog of nostalgia, that movies could be such crap back in the golden age of filmmaking. At best, there are a handful of movies that embody both of these conceits. More so, if you put forth the proposition that one of them does, you are likely to get shouted down by one of the respective peanut galleries. (If you don't believe me, try doing it with Wings, the first Best Picture Oscar winner ever, whose plot is just plain ludicrous.) One of those films is T. Hayes Hunter's hysterical The Ghoul, a movie that falls quite solidly on the cheesy side of that line... but there's a case to be made that it stands right next to The Broadway Melody or The Maltese Falcon as one of the early strongly gay-themed films.

Plot: Henry Morlant (Boris Karloff) is a dying egyptologist who insists on being buried with a jewel that he believes will bring him eternal life...so long as it's not removed from his corpse before he can complete the ritual he needs it for, for if it is, he tells us in Karloff's stentorian voice, he will come back from the grave with murder on his mind. Needless to say, he's not even cold in the ground when various jewel thieves, accomplices, and innocent bystanders congregate for a combination memorial service and race to break into the mausoleum. And of course, Morlant comes back looking for the jewel...

While this is ostensibly a horror movie or a crime film, or some combination of the two, it plays best as a comedy of manners. The plot is often carried forward during exchanges between the characters that can only be described as bitchy snipe-fests, and they're wonderful. (The comedy angle was played up a bit more in the Sidney James/Shirley Eaton adaptation What a Carve-Up! some thirty years later.) It's like what would have happened had Truman Capote and Gore Vidal run for office and gotten a series of televised debates, with a background plot of jewel thievery and zombism.

But wouldn't you know it, it was sold for $75,000 to Professor Morland (who is conveniently dying in his deathbed, leaving instructions to his greedy servant with the Scottish accent, Lang).

The story eventually leads us to our hero, the snotty arrogant nephew of Morland, Raef and his cousin Ms. Holland, who for some reason hate each other because of family tradition.  Yeah, I know.

The story is a bit more complex than what I expected.  Karloff warns that if he does not have the jewel in his hand then he will rise on the full moon.  Well since he didn't have it buried with him (Lang stole it -- subplot of the various places he hides it) he rises!  Or does he?

Or was he buried alive, a victim of catalepsy?

And who is this pastor who's hanging around?

Several people are after this $75,000 (in 1933 money!) jewel and are willing to kill to get it.

The humorous parts fall flat.  The unintentional humor is hilarious.  As Karloff tramps around the countryside looking for revenge, one is reminded of his Frankenstein's monster days and with a bit of the Egyptian mummy thrown in, it makes for a schlocky and yes, even scary at times, film.

When Karloff bends bars with his bare hands -- what a ghoul will do to have a little fun?

The make-up is quite frightful, especially with the closed-eye stuff on Karloff.  And Ernest Thesiger who plays the Scottish creep Lang, would later go on as Dr. Praetorius in Bride of Frankenstein.

The film is dark, very dark.  So dark that they have all the lighting done up in candles!  Makes it hard to see on a streaming video on a flat screen!

The other reviewers have covered everything pretty well, so I'll just add my two cents.
This is the most beautiful print of a B&W movie I have ever seen. At this ridiculously
low price, no one should pass up adding this to their collection if only to see what
an old movie originally looked like. There are way too many garbage transfers out there.
Maybe this one will inspire them.",1285891200,2,517,5.906666666666666

461706,5,6302428149,"The late 30s,early 40s, were a time of experimentation. Out from under the Universal umbrella,where formulas were already being set,this movie was reaching outside of the lines. The Ghoul is one of the most frightening films Karloff ever did. Personally, I would place it as one of his top five performances. In the title role he is not actually a true corpse eating fiend. He is a hateful reanimated mad man. Plot wise I will say no more. No spoilers here.
  The film does use some of the same themes as The Mummy. But the story and the pacing is completely different and Karloff creates his character's supernatural aspects entirely with his body language. Another unique aspect of this film was the rare use of out door locations, lending an extra realism to the nightmarish goings on. There is greater scope to what usually was done as a set bound production.
  This movie lacks for nothing. It does not need color,or nudity,or gallons of blood,or CGI to pump it up. It is a neglected classic and will stand on it's own for generations to come.
  See it in the dark on the biggest screen you can and,,,,well,,pleasant dreams.",1249948800,2,1129,4.6767676767676765
461707,3,6302428149,"Thought to be lost for many years, 1933's THE GHOUL is widely considered England's first genuine horror film of the sound era--and so eager were executives to insure its success they brought Boris Karloff, fresh from his success in FRANKENSTEIN, from Hollywood to play the title role.

The film was based on a popular novel and play of the era.  Professor Morlant (Karloff) is an Egyptologist on his death bed.  He has, however, a jewel stolen from an Egyptian tomb: The Eternal Light, which is said to cause the Egyptian gods to smile upon those buried with it with the gift of eternal life.  But Morlant is not the only one who knows of the jewel, and shortly after his death and burial a host of criminals and innocents descend upon his estate, the former determined to obtain the jewel, the latter determined to find out what is going on with the estate.  Needless to say, candles flicker, shadows move, doors creak, and Morlant rises from the dead in search of the missing jewel.

In one sense, THE GHOUL is an astonishing film, for it has a remarkable atmosphere due largely to the work of cinematographer Gunther Krampf, whose earlier work included the famous German PANDORA'S BOX, as well as uncredited work on the legendary NOSFERATU.  The music score by Louis Levy and Leighton Lucas (the latter uncredited) is also more effective than that found in most films of the period.  But while the direction and performances are at worst at least plausible, the overall film simply doesn't hang together in any consistent way.

The result is a beautifully made vision wrapped around a slow-moving, awkward, and often hard to follow story that finds the characters running around in search of a jewel that looks very much like an ornate shoe buckle.  The performers are entertaining--Karloff is always worth a look, and the supporting cast includes Cedric Hardwick, Ralph Richardson, and the memorably eccentric Ernest Thesinger--but even so THE GHOUL is very thin stuff, not a patch on the earlier horror films from Germany or the horror films being created by Universal Studios in America at the same time.

The DVD presents the film in near-pristine condition, making it easy to appreciate the art design and cinematography, but there are no bonus materials of any kind.  In the end, this is really a film for hardcore fans of 1930s horror, who will be interested to see how England approached the genre.

461708,3,6302428149,"A decidedly uneven mixture of ""The Old Dark House"" and ""The Mummy,"" this 1933 Gaumont production was Britain's first attempt to cash in on the Hollywood horror boom. ""The Ghoul"" benefits from Boris Karloff's terrifying presence as a resurrected Egyptologist, the atmospheric cinematography of Gnther Krampf and an effective score by Louis Levy. When Karloff is off-screen for long stretches, the film drags terribly - despite a solid cast that features Ernest Thesiger, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson in his screen debut. However, the final 30 minutes are truly memorable as Boris emerges from his tomb to reclaim a stolen jewel that will grant eternal life. For many years, ""The Ghoul"" was considered a ""lost"" film until an incomplete and substandard Czech print emerged in the late 1960s.

461709,4,6302428149,"""The Ghoul"" is delightful, old-fashioned gothic horror.  Film legend Boris Karloff stars as Professor Morlant, the eccentric, oddball millionaire who wishes to live forever by means of an Egyptian jewel that is required to be entombed with him.  Unfortunately, on the night of his death, a group of associates and distant relatives descend on his London chateau for their inheritance.  Someone steals the jewel and Morlant rises from his grave in order to get it back so that he may live forever.  Great performances are given by all, especially Kathleen Harrison as the comical, gregarious Kaney.  In fact, the film is laced with quite a bit of humor.  There are some moments of tension as the jewel passes from one thief's hand to another while Morlant attempts to retrieve it.

  ""The Ghoul"" is fun to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  Once considered a ""lost"" film, it will be cherished by all who love gothic horror and/or are fans of Boris Karloff.  Released in 1933, it was filmed in black and white and has an aspect ratio of 1.37:1, which is nearly full frame; modern viewers may not appreciate it.  A higher body count would have helped tremendously; alas, the censors would probably not have allowed it even though the original ""King Kong"" was released in the same year.",1214697600,,1283,4.808219178082192

461713,5,6302428149,"The Ghoul quite has the sense of a lost treasure, it is brilliantly filmed with dark, moody sets and strong, sparse, directional focused lighting, giving an all over creepy feel to a movie where the title role of 'the ghoul' is only actually seen in about three scenes and is never a real threat to anybody.  It boasts stellar performances from Boris Karloff and his fellow cast members, particually Kathleen Harrison as Kaney, a simple, quirky, overly cheerful girl besotted with a phony Sheik who seems destined never to amount to anything other than the leading lady Dorothy Hyson's supporting role, but out of sheer chance ultimatly saves the day.

 The sound is dreadful and it is quite difficult to hear the words beyond the muffled spits and scratches of the deteriated film, but don't let this put you off.  Generally if you love films of this period as I do you are used to, even enjoy their historic aging.  Considering this film was lost until the late 1960s when it was discovered in someones basement, you really have to expect a certain amount of spits and scratches and honestly this very poor quality adds much of the atmosphere and sense that the viewer is watching something unseen for generations.",1147392000,6,1216,4.771428571428571

461716,5,6302428149,"I chanced upon a mention of this film on the internet recently and then read DVD Savant's authoritative review [...] of two years ago. I bought the DVD last week and watched it twice since. I just want to say that, if anything, Savant's review was not enthusiastic enough!

This is a transfer of a miraculously preserved print from the British Film Institute of a horror classic that was thought lost forever. Besides the thrill of watching a 1933 film that looks like a shiny new penny (not to mention the wonderfully sweetened sound by Sonic Solutions), many things about this production make it a ""thorougly modern Mummy"", if you'll pardon the expression.

The attractiveness of the young principals: The girl (Dorothy Hyson) is absolutely pretty and shapely as it should be, if a little stagey in her delivery, and the boy (Anthony Bushell) is a convincing stalwart, if a little stiff. But when it comes to taking stage directions and giving their all to an action scene, they're perfect. (Compare to David Manners and Fay Wray.) The assault  scene in the bedroom and the final fist fight in the tomb are absolutely exemplary while remaining graceful, convincing and extremely well choreographed.

The perfection of Karloff: He speaks his lines like the consummate actor that he is then veers into silent film pantomime mode - with great conviction - in the rest of the film. What a graceful man! [His character's name, Morlant, means ""mort lente"" - slow death - in French, by the way.]

The direction: British director T. Hayes Hunter may be almost unknown nowadays but his long experience of the silents has certainly served him well. This is one film where the return to a perpetually moving camera is evident after the initial staginess of the first talkies. Not a single frame is static or wasted. Everything is economical, effective and to the point. Some inserts (like the two puzzling close-ups of Anubis during Karloff's death scene) are absolutely witty in retrospect. Scene for scene, I daresay this film compares favourably to James Whale's ""Old Dark House"" (1932), even if Whale's film was an influence and they both followed ""The Cat and the Canary"" (1927) and all of them were adapting a hoary stage tradition of supernatural mysteries with a ""perfectly rational"" explanation.

The photography, lighting and art direction by two megastars of the German expressionist era (Gnther Krampf and Alfred Junge): I've never seen ""London in the fog"" scenes quite so effective and neither have you. And the interior decor will positively astound you!

The script: Almost every line is an Oscar opening montage moment and quotable for days. (My favourite line: Kathleen Harrison's speech at the well that starts with the very modern ""I don't think so!"" and ends with ""And after that to Australia!"".) The adaptation (from a stage play) is stupendous. I can't imagine a stage play having all those different actions going on at the same time or a tomb set on fire and then exploding on the stage for that matter. Compare to the sagging middle of ""Dracula"" (1931), if you will. The farcical interplay between the wonderful comedienne Kathleen Harrison (Kaney) and the unflappable straight man Harold Huth (Aga Ben Dragore) is much more than window-dessing. It goes through every phase of  infatuation, coyness, seduction, duplicity, raunchy double-entendre, sexual exploitation, rejection and revenge, all the while serving a story that actually makes sense. Some of Harrison's double takes are outrageously funny. This film was meant to compete with the Universal horrors and American films in general. I think it succeeds admirably and actually shows the Yanks how it should be done. It even gives Hitchcock a run for his money. The main reason for this being the film's secret weapon, namely...

The music score: By Louis Levy and Leighton Lucas, who both eventually wrote film music for Hitchcock. Leighton Lucas has the added distinction of having weaved many of Jules Massenet's melodies and orchestral pieces into the popular British ballet ""Manon"" (1974). Massenet being my favourite composer and since I've always maintained in polite society - after a few drinks, anyway - that all fim music is derived from his operas' incidental music, this is a big deal for my ego. More to the point, the use of music in this film shows other composers how it should be done. This was the same year as Max Steiner's courageous and original ""King Kong"" score and two years before Franz Waxman's epochal score for ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" and many years before Hans J. Salter came to work for Universal in the forties.

I also have to mention Cedric Hardwicke doing a perfectly self-possessed impression of Mr. Rat from ""The Wind and the Willows"", Ralph Richardson going above and beyond the call of duty, Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorius from ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" and of ""Have a po-tah-to"" fame in ""The Old Dark House"") outdoing himself in sheer eccentricity and the two ""Arabs"" giving performances that would be imitated for decades to come (by Akim Tamiroff, among others). Did I forget anyone? The doctor (George Relph) would eventually turn up as Tiberius Caesar in ""Ben-Hur"" (1958) [as Thesiger, come to think of it, would turn up as the very same character in ""The Robe"" (1953)] and even the uncredited delivery boy speaks his two lines (""Carrier!"" and ""I'll oblige you, Guv'nor, I was going straight back as it was."") with great aplomb! And the landlady who welcomes the visiting Arab with: ""We don't want no lino nor nothing!"" Priceless!

Long story short: This is a DVD with great repeat value and, as far as I'm concerned, an immortal instant - if reborn - classic!",1126396800,34,5684,4.95383001049318

While Universal dominated the horror/monster genre in the 30's, this remarkable UK gem is just as good as many of Universal's, and much better than several of them.  I suppose part of the similarities could be due to british director James Whale at Universal and the distinct British/European flavor of the Ghoul.  It also helps that stars movie-monster legen Boris Karloff.  without wanting to spoil it, one of the shortcomings of this film is the revelation of the monster, but it still retains and embodies the spirit of 30's horror through dark, expressionist cinematography and that odd combination of horror and humor that the British have become famous for.

Probably the most underrated aspect of this DVD is the history of the movie.  with no historical background given on the production and the apparent ""loss"" of this movie for some decades, the casual viewer may not even realize how truly fortunate we are to still be able to view this film--and in such clarity for a film once presumed lost!  unfortunately, the packaging of the DVD does not even note this fact, and there are no extra features on the disc to comment about it either.  a commentary would probably be overkill in this case, but i wouldn't mind a small featurette or essay.  while not wanting to judge it by its cover, the packaging can be slightly annoying for the purist, as it appears to want to immitate a modern horror movie rather than a classic, and the tagline, ""An ancient curse is about to be unleashed"" would be more appropriate on a contemporary teenage slasher flick than a Boris Karloff film, which is surprisingly not mentioned on the cover.  while it should be judged on the actual content, the cover hardly seems effective in today's market, where it would be the only thing interested buyers could see on amazon.  it doesn't add to it, but it doesn't really detract from it as far as i'm concerned, since it's a good movie and an immaculate transfer.  while comparisons to James Whale, the Mummy, and Karloff's other films are inevitable, the Ghoul can stand alone as great entertainment.  previous experience with any of the aforementioned is not required, but is definitely recommended to further appreciate it.",1117584000,5,2394,4.821515892420538

MGM's gorgeous DVD release of this Gaumont-British film is truly a treasure that belongs in every Boris Karloff fan's home video library.  Filmed in England in 1933, ""The Ghoul"" gives the actor a plum role, that of an Egyptologist who is convinced that an ancient jewel is his ticket to the afterlife.  Swearing to return from the dead  to kill anyone who dares to steal the gem from his body, the dying professor soon expires ... and is promptly robbed.  Can murder and mayhem be far behind?!  The plot concerning the undead scholar's rampage of revenge is complicated by a twist of mystery as the sacred jewel continues to exchange hands, sought after by a series of suspects who may not be exactly who they claim to be.  It's all great shivery fun, played to near perfection by a distinguished cast.  Karloff, of course, is very effective as the mouldering Professor Morlant, and he's ably supported by Cedric Hardwicke as a mercenary lawyer; Anthony Bushell as the romantic lead; and Ralph Richardson as a priest who frowns upon Karloff's worship of ancient Egyptian gods.  Worthy of special note is frequent Karloff co-star Ernest Thesiger, who played the effete Horace Femm in ""The Old Dark House"" and the quirky Dr. Praetorious in ""Bride of Frankenstein""; here, as Karloff's club-footed Scottish valet, Thesiger plays with uncommon vocal and physical restraint, allowing his marvelously gaunt face and piercing eyes to create his character.  It's a wonderfully effective portrayal.

As mentioned earlier, MGM's DVD presentation is of phenomenally high quality.  ""The Ghoul"" was once considered a lost film, until a deteriorated, subtitled print was finally discovered in the late 1960's.  Fans and film scholars who had long waited to see the movie were understandably disappointed upon finally viewing the only copy available to them, and the film's reputation suffered accordingly.  If only they had seen this pristine transfer, which is for all intents and purposes ""flawless""!  Featuring crisp, clear sound, and outstanding video, the DVD showcases the beautifully composed deep-focus photography of cameraman Gunther Krampf, and the top notch skill of makeup artist Heinrich Heitfeld - whose transformation of Karloff into a withered and disfigured old man is nothing short of astonishing.  This one's definitely a keeper, one you'll be proud to own and enjoy over repeated viewings.",1116720000,4,2445,5.209718670076726
461729,4,6302428149,"I had seen the great lost Boris Karloff film, ""The Ghoul,"" here on Amazon for quite a long time and have had it in my cart for a long time too. Whenever I went to make a DVD purchase I would put ""The Ghoul"" aside waiting to buy it at a later date. I don't know what my hesitation sprang from except for the fact that I was a little unsure of how the film would look and was concerned about spending money on something that might be a major disappointment. I had purchased the Kino version of Karloff's other lost 1930s film, ""The Old Dark House,"" and was very unhappy with the horrible quality of the film print used to make the DVD (of course, that is the only print known to exist).

Well, I should have never worried about ""The Ghoul."" The picture and sound quality of this DVD is outstanding. The film looks like it could have been transferred from an original pristine master negative. I can't imagine that it looked better even when it was new.

So, what about the film itself? Well, I think you have to be a fan of Karloff and early 1930s horror films in order to enjoy ""The Ghoul."" If you don't fall in to either of these categories than this movie isn't for you. But if you are a fan of the Universal horror movies of Hollywood's golden age than you really should enjoy this gem. Although made in Britain, ""The Ghoul"" looks like it could have been produced on Universal's backlot. The atmosphere, the quality sets and photography, the cast (including actors who had or would work at Universal) are all reminiscent of that studio's vintage horror product.

""The Ghoul"" isn't in a league with other early 1930s horror classics like ""Frankenstein"" or ""The Invisible Man"" but it is a reasonably entertaining production. Admittedly the film is a bit slow and creaky in spots but, hey, how many films from this era aren't? Personally, I found ""The Ghoul"" more lively and fast-moving than some of Universal's films of this period (""Dracula"" and ""The Mummy"" come to mind).

On of the films he did, his first in England was this 1933 horror, The Ghoul.  The film was lost for decades an only recently was found in the past 25 years.

Derivative of The Mummy, Karloff plays Egyptoligist Professor Morlant who is on his deathbed at the beginning of the film.  He instructs his servant Laing, to bury him with an Egyptian artifact called ""the Eternal Light"" bandaged in his hand.  At the light of the first full moon, the artifact is supposed to restore Morlant to life and make him immortal.

Laing however steals the gem from his hand...not to keep, but to give to Morlants heirs.  However others have designs on the gem including Broughton, Morlants business manager and a couple of mysterious Egyptians.

At the full moon, Morlant returns to life, but as an undead ghoul, bent on revenge.  Karloff, looks not too much unlike the Ardeth Bey character from the Mummy with wizened, somewhat decomposing features as he moves about killing those who seek to steal from him.

If there is one negative of the movie it's that karloff isn't in it all that much.  He dies in the first 10 minutes or so and then doesn't appear again until some 30 -35 minutes later.  Not exactly what you would expect from a ""starring"" role.

The stellar cast features Ernest Thesiger as Laing.  Thesiger would go on to star with karloff in the Bride of Frankenstein as the evil Dr. Pretorious.  Broughton is played by the cooly evil Sir Cedrick Hardwicke.  And a Young Sir Ralph Richardson plays a local vicar.

The person put in charge of making the DVD was told to see what he could do with it.  He made a few cursory calls just to cover the bases, including a call to the British Film Institute.  Turns out that they were sitting on a copy that had not been screened in decades.  It is overuse of a copy of a film that gives it the ""beat"" look; it we could take a first generation copy print of Frankenstein today, it could in theory look this good without a total overall.  The print was so good that a typical transfer looked like it was made yesterday.
The Ghoul dates from a time when the studios had not yet wholeheartedly committed to making supernatural horror.  They felt that audiences needed a final logical explanation to buy into it.  The Universal films of the 30's turned that tide around, but this movie was still not fully into that realm.  So if you go in expecting a super shock, you will be disappointed.  However, if you like atmosphere and good acting, and want to see an amazing transfer of a 30's movie that looks like it was filmed yesterday, look no further.  The plusses outweigh the minuses in this case.",1078444800,3,1262,4.354700854700854
461734,2,6302428149,"I've tried watching this movie over the years and found it boring,cold and so confusing that I could never understand what was happening. With this new DVD, I decided to give it another chance. Verdict: it's just as boring, cold and confusing as before. Technically, it looks great. Wonderful shadows and lighting. But this film moves soooooo slow. And poor Boris Karloff. He does what he can in the role of the glaring, stumbling old ghoul but he acts embarassed by the whole stunt. Great Britian simply didn't have the know-how in the early thirties to make a great horror flick like those being turned out by Universal. Don't waste your time on this one. Watch the l932 ""The Mummy"" instead to see how a real classic looks.",1075680000,4,725,4.671875
461735,4,6302428149,"In this 1933 British film--made between Boris Karloff's stints as the monster in 1931's FRANKENSTEIN and THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN in 1935--Karloff plays a dying Egyptologist who possesses an occult gem, known as The Eternal Light, that he believes will bring him immortality if he is buried with it and is thereby able to present it to Anubis in the afterlife.  Of course, his bickering, covetous heirs and avaricious associates would rather keep the gem for themselves.  With this in mind, Karloff vows to rise from his grave and seek revenge should anybody meddle in his plans, and he keeps this promise when, just after his death, one of his colleagues steals The Eternal Light.
THE GHOUL is an atmospheric gothic flick that generates a lot of gooseflesh, but modern audiences may find the plot development a bit slow, and gore-hounds weaned on the likes of THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE and similar fare will certainly not think the film is very scary.  But film aficionados who love the old Universal monster movies of the 1930s and 1940s will find a lot to enjoy here.
The acting is very good--especially from Ernest Thesiger, who would later go on to play Dr. Pretorious in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN--though the excellent Karloff has only a few dramatic scenes early on and, as a risen corpse, is later reduced to staggering around in creepy make-up (reminiscent of his make-up in THE MUMMY the year before).  Supporting performances from Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson help round out the good job delivered by a wonderful cast.
Based on both the novel and the play by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J. Hines, this early British horror film--the first to receive an ""H"" (""Horrific"") rating from the British Board of Film Censors--was once thought to have been forever lost to history.  A complete print of THE GHOUL was discovered in Czechoslovakia in the late 1960s, however, and was later restored under the supervision of the Museum of Modern art and Janus Films.  The MGM DVD transfer was made from this beautifully restored print, and the VERY reasonable price of said disc definitely makes this a must-have for serious film collectors and students of classic cinema.",1071964800,72,2182,4.899728997289973
461736,5,6302428149,"Crystal clear and astounding film restoration enhance the splendid manner in which Boris Karloff stares, walks and stalks, making this a truly delightful treasure.  Karloff, professor of Egyptology, knows he is dying, but his fears are greatly diminished after realizing that he has discovered an ancient gem which provides the key to immortality (thanks of course to the powers of the Egyptian gods).  The scholarly one ceases to breath, the gem is stolen, and the now ""living corpse"" is simply dying to retrieve it!  The incomparable Ernest Thesiger is also wonderful (the British actor had previously given the ""performance of his life"" in another nearly lost film, ""Old Dark House"", 1932).  ""The Ghoul"" features non stop creepy atmosphere with an occassional smattering of comic relief.  The script is fresh (especially for a mummy), and the characters and dialogue are actually quite interesting!",1071187200,2,901,5.316901408450704

""If it's stolen, I'll return from the dead and seek revenge."" Naturally, the servant steals the stone. You get the idea.  The 1933 UK film features a young Ralph Richardson.

461760,3,6302428149,"For decades the film ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (1933) was considered one of the great, lost Hollywood films.  Those who remembered it claimed it was far superior to the 1951 remake ""House of Wax"" and for many years horror aficionados mourned its loss.  When a clean print surfaced in the early 1970's everyone was crestfallen to discover this ""lost masterpiece"" was really a creaky, old thriller far inferior to it's 50's, 3D offspring.  Well, here we go again.  The long lost Karloff film finally comes to the faithful intact! As already noted this MGM release is DVD is a technical stunner.  What a shame that the movie itself is dull as dishwater and an ideal choice for those with insomnia.  Karloff actually has very little to do here and the acting of the rest of the cast is strictly of the summer stock variety.  As for the script, it's a castrated rehashing of both ""The Old Dark House"" and ""The Mummy"".  Yep, it LOOKS just like an entry from Universal's 1930's horror parade, but lacks any kind of punch.  Don't misunderstand,  as a horror buff I'm overjoyed to have ""The Ghoul"" in such fantastic shape - but boy, what a let down!",1066003200,2,1142,4.58128078817734
461761,5,6302428149,"I don't really have much to add to the glowing reviews above.  This is simply the finest quality film restoration for a film from this era that I have seen.  If you're a fan of Universal horror and/or Karloff you will treasure this film.
I think all us classic horror fans should send MGM a nice ""thank you"" note for the attention they have given this fairly obscure 70 year old film.  And perhaps they will be encouraged to put out more of the same.  I suggest ""The Vampire Bat"", made around the same time.
Look at all those 5 star reviews....go get this DVD!!",1063152000,3,561,4.314285714285714
461762,5,6302428149,"Looking at the artwork on the case, you might think this was a newer film, say, one made in the last 20 years, but that is not so.  This movie was actually made in the early 30's, and is an excellent companion to the Universal horror movies of the time.
Boris Karloff stars as a professor/Egyptologist who is soon to pass into the great beyond.  Through his studies, he believes he's found the key to immortality, in a ancient gem called The Eternal Light.  Now, there is a little confusion on my part as to what possesion of this gem is supposed to do, if it makes one immortal or opens a passage to a wonderous paradise in the afterlife, but the gem in question is highly sought after due to its' monetary and supernatural value.
Karloff's character passes on, and guess what?  The gem is stolen!  This prompts Karloff's corpse to come back to life and seek out the gem.  Things get a tad confusing, as Karloff's heirs get involved, along with a butler, an unscrupulous accountant, a couple of Egyptians, a priest, and so on.  If you follow closely, you should be able to keep things straight, but if your attention wanders, you will miss something.  Karloff's make up was kept minimal, which I thought worked really well, and the quality of the production seemed fairly high, even though I am sure the actual production budget was pretty modest.  A great example of making the most of what you have.  The atmosphere was thoroughly creepy, and even the comic relief, who I found annoying at first, sort of grew on me.  But, in the end, see this movie for Karloff, as he's in his prime.  He may not have a lot of dialogue, but his actions and facial expressions speak louder than words.  I would say this movie is a combonation of The Mummy and The Old Dark House.
There are no extras, but the print and sound are both excellent, and, from reading other reviews on the rarity of this movie, sounds like this excellent print has been on many peoples wishlist for a long time.  I give a lot of credit to MGM, not only for releasing movies from their catalog in a timely manner, but also keeping an eye towards the quailty of the prints of the films they put on DVD.",1062460800,14,2164,4.418136020151134

After Morlant death, he arises from the dead and discovers the jewel has been stolen and then goes looking for it.
The makeup is effective and Boris does appear to resemble something more dead than alive.

  Hats off to MGM!  This film was considered lost for many years.  When it finally showed up on video it was a scratchy, spliced-up VHS without the original credits or theme music.  I was astounded when I saw the quality of this DVD.  It's scratch-free and complete!  Plus it's a smooth looking picture with very little grain -- I only wish that Universal's DVD of Bride of Frankenstein looked this good.  The sound is very clear too.
  In short, you won't confuse it with a modern release (it's 70 years old), and there are no extras of any kind, but for a film this old and obscure it's FAR more than I expected.  Go get it!",1061942400,5,746,4.25
461765,5,6302428149,"I have yet to see the 'Citizen Kane' disc (which I have heard a lot of good things about), but I will tell you what;  this is far and away the best treatment of an older black and white film I have seen as yet on DVD.  It almost looks as if it could have been filmed yesterday!  The astounding quality leaves any recent VHS releases in the dust - especially the decrepit, well worn old Czech copy which, not all that long ago, was thought to be the only surviving print.
The film itself is very British and quirky and odd, and carries itself off as a spooky mystery most of the way through.  Mr. Karloff is mostly in the first ten minutes and last twenty minutes of the film, and it is not a role that gives him too much to do except sport a creepy Ardath Bey-esque makeup job and run around being.....well, ghoulish.  Some good vintage black & white horror style graveyard goings on throughout.
But the real highlight here is the DVD itself.  For a relatively minor production from what I believe was a low budget film company which was probably filmed on lower grade stock and lacking in the technological advances that the larger studios  boasted back in 1933, this is really something.  Someone put a lot of care into this restoration and it shows.
No extras to speak of - which may account in part for this disc's remarkable affordability as well.  After watching this - especially if you are a vintage horror die hard who has already sat through a few creaky, muffled VHS viewings of this once almost forgotten gem and you have something to compare this fantastic DVD to - any future DVD releases of ANY vintage black and white film will be held to a higher standard.

For years the only available way to see the Ghoul was on an awful looking transfer made from what looked like a third generation dupe on VHS without main titles and severely edited. I saw the un-impressive cover art online and thought ""What the heck, it can't be worse then that vhs video"". What a pleasantly AMAZING surprise. A crisp, clean unblemised picture awaited me! I would think that someone at M.G.M. home video would have mentioned that this new, pristine source transfer was being made available for the first time on their new DVD version!.

""The Ghoul"" was really the first major horror film produced in England and obviously tries to follow-up on his previous success in Universal's ""The Mummy.""  A rather simple tale that moves too slow for the most part, the film does show that even when his makeup is relatively simple, there is something about the way Karloff stares and the way he walks that is more suggestive of the dead than the living.  Directed in 1933 by T. Hayes Hunter, the film features future Knights of the Empire Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson.  Based on the novel and play by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J.
