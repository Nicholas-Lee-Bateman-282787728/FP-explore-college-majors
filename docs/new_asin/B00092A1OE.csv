2260745,4,B00092A1OE,"You have to like heavy scifi shows and the concept of mutants with super powers.  If you do, then this is an enjoyable series.  I was left wishing that they had gone beyond 3 seasons.",1203120000,,183,4.2
2260746,5,B00092A1OE,"Season 2 is a million times better than season 1. Not only in the special effects department, but in the storyline department as well.  Season 1 was too plot driven and Season 2 shows the characters more in depth with much better character development. The best episodes of season 2 are Whose Woods These Are, Crossroads of the Soul, Lest He Become, and the two ALL TIME BEST EPISODES of season 2, are definately Hard Time and One Step Closer!  Season 2 is so much better than season 1! So happy they finally released the complete season together.  MUTANT X RULES!!!!",1139961600,8,567,4.594059405940594
2260747,5,B00092A1OE,"The storyline is just so creative and fresh , it will blow you away. You can clearly see that the writers and producers weren't afraid to take risks and try and find a new magic formula for addictive science fiction. Well they damn well found it. If you loved he old Star Trek style and want something to watch -other thn the millions of new copies of it thats eem to dominate television today, look no more.

This show has engaging, non stereotypical characters and combines fantasy with sci-fi ; magic with technology; superpowers with human weaknesses and more. The martial arts sequesnces are stunning , especially for a rookie company with not a lot of money to spend. Its a shame that it was cancelled, which just goes to show that nowadays networks aren't willing to spend on shows that may be different.

Perhaps we can save that by supporting great shows. Buy this disk set and watch the magic unfold.",1126915200,11,910,4.611111111111111
2260748,5,B00092A1OE,This is the explosive second season of a very well studied sci-fi tv serie: a perfect cast and a very balanced use of special effect without forgetting to explore the personality of each component of this wonderful group! we want a fourth season please!!!,1126569600,5,255,4.818181818181818
2260749,5,B00092A1OE,"This season was way better than the 1st season. You see more devolpment in the characters and much better plots. With Eckhart (the previous villain) out of the way the Mutant X team got so much more done and got to do so much cooler things. You see more of Adam's (the leader) secrets, more of Shalimar and Brennen's relationship, and Jesse and Emma really grow. Loved this season, can't wait for the third!",1126051200,7,407,4.513513513513513
2260750,1,B00092A1OE,"S1 wasn't great tv, but it was enjoyable and had a distinct style and atmosphere.  The sets were wonderful.  And it had Mason Eckhart, played with intelligence and humor.  So...for S2, most of those sets were abandoned, the style thrown out the door, Eckhart largely forgotten, and the series premise buried.

What were they thinking?  Were they thinking?

S2 is good chiefly for unintended humor:  Shalimar wandering through the (mosquito and black fly infested Ontario) woods with her gut exposed;  Shalimar crawling under razor wire with her gut exposed; Brennan strung up between 4 horses (go horsies!); the Guy in the Rubber Fish suit; the spinal fluid drinking aliens; Adam's old anorexic hysterical girlfriend; the Guy in the Ape Suit; Shalimar's preposterous account of her childhood being beaten in a mental institution; Gabriel Ashlocke croaking because no one could think of anything else to do with him; the phoney sounds-like-Eckhart but can't-be-Eckhart because Eckhart was so much smarter and wittier;  the ""abandoned missile silos"" shown as agricultural silos (!!! missile silos are below ground!!!); but the best came in the first and last episodes, with Adam, smartest man in the world and Scientist practicing ceremonial magic (!!!) and the model tipping and burning in the finale (how does steam burn, anyway???).

Some of this must be seen to be believed, and for that reason alone, buy the set, pop some popcorn, and prepare to howl as Adam dabbles in Egyptian magic.",1123718400,2,1489,5.141078838174274
2260751,5,B00092A1OE,I enjoyed the dvds and was impressed with service I received from amazon. The order was processed and delivered with accuracy and speed.  Many thanks,1123027200,6,149,4.96
2260752,4,B00092A1OE,"I happen to really like the show, so I am biased. But, I bought the singles dvds for over $100 so this is a great deal. This season the production values were so much better than season 1 and it shows, a lot more action, most of it, took place away from sanctuary. They all start to grow in their powers which reveals a dark side to Emma, and Brennan acts like a petulant teenager and questions and confronts Adam on everything. Fans, be sure to check out episodes 201, 205, 206,218, 220. The ""Inferno"" episode is truly the best.

Buy it you won't be disappointed.",1116460800,11,564,4.320754716981132
2260753,5,B00092A1OE,"mutant x is one of the best shows around i cant believe they ended it on a cliff hanger and never made any more. i think season 2 is a really good season as it shows when ashlock gets into shalimars head, which is really interesting to see.",1116288000,4,240,4.020833333333333

2260760,5,B00092A1OE,This set is highly recommended as a collector's item if you love the genre! The extras are captivating and the set was perfect in providing the family a full month of entertainment!,1410220800,,181,4.6875

2260763,4,B00092A1OE,"At base a series about super-human action heroes from a comic book background. For a TV Series the special FXs were decent given the budget at hand. On the other hand the launch of the airship the double helix uses the same footage every time. The same footage is used every time we approach Genomax and many other sequences give one a feeling of deja vu. The settings in Toronto are not readily identifiable but then most people have never been to the former Downview Airforce Base though they may have walked there for a papal visit. Scarborough Bluffs provide the setting for Sanctuary, the actual space inside is miles to the North-West. Aside from their mutant abilities all but Emma are remarkable martial artists. Their abilities mean that they don't pack a lot of weapons.

The show ended abruptly because one of its production companies fell apart ending it after 3 seasons. Tom McCamus was temporarily written out of the show to perform at Stratford. Shalimar and Brennan are the flashy characters, Jesse is the more quiet studious computer geek type who also does mechanical repairs and Emma is downright reticent. The three seasons fall in and out of availability. Aside from providing a sound track dubbed in French there are no other supplements, not even subtitles.

Proving that clothes really do help make the man clad in hand me down loose-fitting dungarees held up by braces and a plaid shirt Victor Webster looks very much the country bumpkin. Even so-clad he seems to retain his sex appeal for women. And to prove it he takes off his clothes in several episodes to show off the muscles underneath and a well-honed six-pack.

Watching this second season on DVD with episodes back to back one develops a sense of the tension developing between members of the team and their leader Adam. Leaders maintain their position by controlling the flow of information and the reasons for the decisions they make. Increasingly the members of the team demand a more collaborative approach; they come to resent the paternalistic, patronizing methods used on them when they were children.

In the final episode we get to see them blow up the pods at Ontario Place.",1401667200,,2169,4.8382749326145555
2260764,5,B00092A1OE,I watched the first 2 seasons when they where on tv. But was unable to watch the 3rd and last one. Till I found them on here. Now I am hooked all over again on them,1399334400,4,164,3.5833333333333335
2260765,5,B00092A1OE,"I love this series. It also has sexy actresses, and I love the action and fast-paced plots in it. I love Victoria Pratt.",1398729600,,120,4.260869565217392
2260766,5,B00092A1OE,I loved this series and was so disappointing when Marvel sued the show because of similar names the show the show was left uncompleted after a major cliff hanger. So you were never really sure what happen. Easy to get into and dramatic enough that you care about the charterers lives.,1396396800,,284,4.588235294117647
2260767,3,B00092A1OE,"I've been looking for this series for a long time. I once ended up with a crazy bootleg copy which I thought was legit when I bought it. Nevertheless, every time I buy, I seem to be disappointed in some way. This was a fantastic series, and the episodes are all here so I'm satisfied by that. However, the packaging is the cheapest, flimsiest piece of junk I've ever seen. I dropped season two and the part that holds the discs inside broke. I am also disappointed that they were not programmed with close captioning (I'm a little hard of hearing). Luckily I remember enough to fill in the parts I can't hear, but if you are deaf or hard of hearing, this is probably not for you. I am satisfied that I finally have all three seasons of episodes, but hopefully, someday, a better copy with closed captioning and special features will be released. I've got my fingers crossed anyway.",1392940800,13,881,4.478260869565218
2260768,5,B00092A1OE,I was finally able to get the complete series at an affordable price. The only real complaint that a person could have about this series is that it didn't last longer than three seasons.,1392163200,5,186,4.5
2260769,5,B00092A1OE,This will be given as a gift so don't know yet. But I think she will like them very much,1380758400,,88,3.45

2260771,1,B00092A1OE,The product arrived fast. The problem was that is was sold as new and there was no plastic wrap on the box and the box was damaged. I was refunded my money so now I am waiting on a new one. One problem is I had to pay to ship back the damaged product and I did not think that was fair.,1365120000,,285,3.6129032258064515
2260772,3,B00092A1OE,i loved this show when it was on the air .  i wounld watch this on the weekends a lot like  x man  but it about the jounary to the place,1363996800,,136,3.3225806451612905
2260773,5,B00092A1OE,Loved the series and was never able to watch all the different episodes now I can watch when I want to,1357171200,,102,3.9047619047619047
2260774,5,B00092A1OE,Love the show.  Also great to have this season in one set instead of 5 2-disk volumes.  Takes up a lot less space.,1353024000,,114,3.9130434782608696
2260775,5,B00092A1OE,"I watched this series when it first aired on TV and, although the FX are a bit clunky the stories are just as fun as ever. I am enjoying reliving the show in DVD format, it's nice not to have commercials interrupting the action!",1341792000,,228,4.204545454545454
2260776,5,B00092A1OE,"A real guilty pleasure. I loved watching this show. I watch the DVDS so much now I think  they will burn up. I bought an extra set, this new set.",1340582400,,145,3.8333333333333335
2260777,5,B00092A1OE,Of course this comes out after I get the one made in China. If there are special features of this then I would get it.,1329955200,,118,3.76
2260778,3,B00092A1OE,"This season, gone is the hammy arch nemesis. But the acting is still mediocre. There is still no character or plot development. The writing is bad, the acting is bad (though they can only act what they're given so I blame the writers for not giving them more to do). Action is cartoonish. So, basically, more of the same... A pretty average / mediocre teen / 20-something drama. A pity they didn't develop it more. Probably better off with something else like Buffy, Angel, Charmed or Roswell...? I'd hoped for more.

If you like the show, the transfer's fine. Sound is fine. If you're looking for something academy-award worthy, look elsewhere... This ain't it. Vaguely competent, but in no way exceptional.",1329177600,,708,4.851239669421488
2260779,4,B00092A1OE,"This was one of my favorite shows (I didn't care for season 3)
Great content, but my biggest gripe is the the DVDs fall out of the package!  Be careful!",1324080000,,152,4.066666666666666

it came a week later. custmer service was ok.",1322438400,,105,4.0476190476190474
2260781,5,B00092A1OE,"The Second Season is one of the best of them, as it shows a little more of the New Mutants and also explores the past of the main characters. You also get to see how Adam Kane was and how he is now. Also the story arch of the most powerful mutant on Earth comes to a close. I loved it all. It had all the things worthy of a great show. Season Two is also where the characters develop more and I like that. One of the reason I am glad I have it!",1320278400,,444,3.6842105263157894
2260782,5,B00092A1OE,A very well written and produced show.  The use of belivable special effects and the character developement was very well done.,1315785600,,127,5.0476190476190474
2260783,5,B00092A1OE,"Mutant X Season two is great. The characters of the story are wonderful to watch. If you are into X-Men or any other superheroes, get Mutant-X. You will enjoy it. It is a must have. The DVDs are hard to find in stores, so get it while you can through Amazon.",1289952000,,258,4.078431372549019

8056728,4,B00092A1OE,"I've been watching Mutant X since I first laid eyes on it on TV when I was very little, so young that I was still in the phase of doing make believe role-playing with my cousin and friends of our favorite TV shows and movies like Pokemon, Digimon, X-Men, and then came along Mutant X. Of course me and my cousin got addicted and started doing our little make believe world of Mutant X too!! So somewhere along the lines a few years later when some Christmas came around, I got the first season of Mutant X. The good version in the HUGE case (ones where nowadays they sell separately in volumes like S1 V4). THAT was truly the good version of a complete season set coming with all your special features, HAS A HYSTERICAL COMMENTARY WITH FORBES AND VICKY ON ONE OF THE EPISODES THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST WATCH, scene selections, episode guides and names listed, closed captioning etc. Unfortunately seeing as how that was probably at least 15 plus years ago, I have since lost that one. My love and passion for Mutant X has never diminished though!! So when I saw this set I just had to get it seeing as how it was cheaper than some of the others and it's region code was #1 made viewable for the USA as some of the other MX sets are much more pricy and a lot of their codes are not R1. Well I should've read the reviews and gone with the more pricy one.
Mind you, this collection is great in the sense that I finally have all 3 seasons of Mutant X and get to watch them.
Pros:
Decent Price
Get the entire season collection
If you want just the basics and nothing else, don't mind not having closed captioning, episode names or selection, and your special features then this set is perfect for you. This set is seriously just the stripped down basic model.
Cons:
NO SPECIAL FEATURES WHATSOEVER: I'm talking nothing!!! There's not even a special features listed.
NO closed captioning.
NO Scene Selection
NO Episode Selection/list/names on the box or disc main menu
NO Episode Commentaries
FLIMSY Packaging and casing!! Be careful!!! The slip the DVDs are kept is utter crap any bending or brush against anything and it's ruined!
The DVD fold out case is absolute crap!!! The pieces of plastic that hold the DVDs in place will fall out with the slightest bump, giggle or movement!!!

Basically: if you're okay with having just the standard stripped down version of mutant x with nothing but the play button basically then this is the set for you!! If you're wanting the special features etc then keep on looking! Be warned if you buy this set: HANDLE THE CASING WITH CARE!
Overall though: I'm just happy to be able to watch my mutant x finally season 1-3. Personal note: I will be buying a second series collection with the special features.",1420761600,3,2736,4.505030181086519
