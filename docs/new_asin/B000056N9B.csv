7932282,3,B000056N9B,"I'm talking about Sam Phillips, Penthouse Pet. Tall, blonde and busty, she has no equal amongst the '90s era pin-ups.

Now, this DVD appears to hold two episodes of the odd late-night series Hot Springs Hotel, a sometimes funny, many times sexy, show about two babes (Sam Phillips and Glori Gold) who run a hotel where people have a lot of sex. As this was a Showtime series the sex consists of that lame '90s softcore crap where people would move slightly, but they still had most of their clothes on. The nudity is pretty much topless only; and the real problem with HSH was the lack of Sam and Glori nudity. There were times were they would go several episodes without even wearing something less revealing than their hotel uniforms. And seeing as how this DVD contains only two episodes, well, don't be expecting to see the lovely Sam naked anytime soon.",1094169600,4,858,4.607843137254902
