8202004,3,B0002L68LC,"Recording is made in the theater of Chigago. It is the first part hour of a two hour concert. This DVD is titled Volume One and the content is Latin-Pop. I don't know if a Volume Two with a Mariachi part exists. Most songs are from the CD ""Piel De Angel"" (1997), which i recommend strongly. One song that we know as ""Ya no"" is titled here as ""Demasiado Tarde"". The music is great, but the audio quality of the recording is not good. The Band consists of 3 background singer, percussion, drums, bass, e-guitar, trumpet, trombone, sax and keyboard. The video quality is ok for a disk from that time. The performance of Lucero is great, but not as secure and good like in the newer concert DVD from Mexico. The Band is quiet good, but for me not enough entusiastic. A fan of Lucero will still have fun with this DVD.
