6567102,5,B00MAS01TA,"Generally I'll only review movies when they have very low number of people rating them. If you are into still photography this is a great movie since it shows you some of the iconic (war) images from call it Spanish Civil War through 9/11.  You hear the photographers talk about their work, about the work of others, and can SEE why they can say 'If it's not a good photo you weren't close enough.""  And why that is so very true -- it's basically all combat related photos, but they are the iconic ones, and was, for me, VERY worth the watching.  Mostly ALL still photos very few in color.  I rate it according to the following scale:
5) A-, A -- worth a watch every few years or longer, but defiantly worth a second watch
4) B-, B+ -- Worth watching once at least, a very good film
3) C-, C+ -- maybe worth watching if you are into the genre, or is NEVER worth another watch
2) fail -- So bad it's barely worth mentioning, think about what it takes to get a D in school.
1) fail -- SO VERY bad, it may not deserve even one star, nothing worth seeing, poor everything.",1412121600,5,1068,4.169902912621359
6567103,5,B00MAS01TA,"Get the Picture is the most powerful and moving film I have ever seen on the world of photojournalism. For any individual who is aspiring to be a photojournalist, this DVD is a must. I am also reading John G. Morris's book Get the Picture. I first saw the DVD in a Peter Turnley Street Photography Workshop in New York City. Peter is one of the photojournalists featured in this DVD,",1410220800,4,383,4.408450704225352

6567105,5,B00MAS01TA,"More than just a biopic about photo editor John G. Morris, this is an amazing documentary about the hard job of photo journalists, particularly in war zones. Through John's eyes we see the work and impact of famous photographers, including Robert Capa, Henri Cartier Bresson, W. Eugene Smith, Elliott Erwitt, Eddie Adams, Nick Ut, and many others.  The underlying message is the calamity of war and a great desire to stop it.",1407974400,5,425,4.902777777777778

6567111,4,B00MAS01TA,"Well produced documentary about someone I was totally unaware of. Mr. Morris had an interesting and long career, and this film highlighted the most interesting parts of it (his early days and WWII). It wandered off the main subject (Mr. Morris' career and life) a few times, especially toward the last third of the film, by devoting quite a bit of time to other war photographers' personal anti-war views. I thought this was very distracting from the main theme, and they didn't even tie it to Morris' own views. The effort could have better been used on more of Morris' experiences and work.",1445644800,,592,4.757281553398058
