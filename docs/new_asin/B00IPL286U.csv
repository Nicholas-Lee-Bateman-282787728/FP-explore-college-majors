6284842,5,B00IPL286U,"If you are a fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Stax Records, Ron Wood, Dr. John, Chicago Blues, Willie Dixon, Billy Preston, Carla Thomas, you'll love this show. It's a concert recorded in 1989 that was only recently rediscovered, with completely remixed audio and video. The concert aired on PBS in March 2014, but this version has even more music. Previously unseen performances by Stevie Ray Vaughan and his band, with his brother, Jimmie. Fantastic!",1395705600,38,446,5.04054054054054

6284847,4,B00IPL286U,"This historical concert is a testament of not only the performers but also of Lee Atwater who was Reagan and Bush 41's main advisor as well as the chairman of the Republican National Committee.  In the beginning of the film, Atwater (who passed away in 1991 of a brain tumor) states that this inaugural gala event wasn't about politics. He was right. It was about blues,old school R&B and soul music. Some of the many things that made this country so great. Besides a blistering performance by SRV, you'll witness KoKo Taylor, Willie Dixon, the Iceman Albert Collins, Bo Diddley among others. Even Ron Wood from the Rolling Stones can be seen playing with the band as well as Donald Dunn and Steve Cropper. This is a well put together package, no matter what your political persuasion. Just enjoy the music and wished you were there like I did.",1441929600,6,844,4.6644295302013425

6284883,5,B00IPL286U,"This is a great mix of Blues/Soul/R&B artists.  Now, 35 years after the concert, you can be there with these legendary composers and performers, even though a number of them are no longer with us.  For me, the stand-out performance is the opportunity to see Willie Dixon on stage singing his own classic Chicago blues songs. Other artists performing multiple songs include Bo Diddley, Delbert McClinton, Jimmie Vaughn and Stevie Ray Vaughn.  Anyone who is a fan of classic R&B, Texas, Memphis, or Chicago Blues should consider this a must-have DVD, and it gets my highest recommendation. .",1403913600,6,589,4.989795918367347

6284885,4,B00IPL286U,"The title of the DVD is interesting and probably incomplete.  With that said, the music contained within is great.  There are great performances by many soul and blues musicians that are no longer with us.  Although some may not have been in their prime, the performances were top notch.  Delbert McClinton's set and Stevie Ray Vaughan's set are not to be missed!  Jimmie Vaughan and Albert Collins jam with Stevie on Collin's Frosty.  Certainly enough great music to make Texas proud! Well worth the money!",1403136000,13,507,4.905882352941177

6284889,5,B00IPL286U,"I've been looking forward to this ever since I saw Carla Thomas on the front page of The Sunday New York Times the morning after this show 25 years ago. She was standing between Lee Atwater and President Bush who both had on electric guitars and all three were beaming.
This is an astounding show. Every single artist brought their best stuff and they all blew the roof off the place. This is flat out fun and the performances are mind blowing. If you've ever liked any of these artists, you will love this concert. This is high on my list of the great shows of all time. Play it loud.",1399507200,12,585,4.2792792792792795
6284890,1,B00IPL286U,There is one song repeated over and over - its a badly done copy of the original concert.  I can't believe I'm the only customer who feels this way - it is not a concert and certainly not worth what I paid for it/  I actually want my money back however I'm afraid Amazon will charge me for the postage and not reimburse me.  crazy.,1399420800,3,331,4.061538461538461

Koko, Dr. John, The Vaughan Brothers, Joe Lewis Walker and so many more, guest players like Ronnie Wood, man too many to list here, and everyone was at the top of their game !
