2679235,3,B000JU8HKG,"Not sure if the book is much better in terms of a workout...this DVD is definitely for the beginner exerciser.  The segments are very short, I barely got out of breath.  The cardio segment is very quick and you don't do much besides marching and grapevines.  The weight segment for your arms and back are in a very quick sequence, which doesn't give you time to switch up the weights (since you work your arms and back which differ in size it would be nice to have time to change from 5 lb to 8 lb).  The last segment for your hips and abs is probably the best but that is not saying much.  I can see doing this workout just to do SOMETHING if you are a little out of shape or don't like sweaty workouts.  However, for a real butt kicking definitely get you in shape workout for your wedding, I highly recommend The Firm workouts.  After those you WILL feel the burn.",1167523200,10,867,4.218181818181818
2679286,2,B000JU8HKG,"but the dvd is a disappointment. I thought it would be the workout in the book... so that rather than just a picture, I could listen or watch... But its not... Its totally different.  Focuses on cardio, work with a band, etc.  I'm sure its not a bad work out, but I really like the format of the book, I've only been working on it for 3 or 4 weeks now and can already see a difference.  I returned the DVD.",1187136000,7,406,3.9876543209876543
2679287,5,B000JU8HKG,"This was an excellent exercise video, you feel the burn the very first time you use it.",1185926400,,87,4.176470588235294
2679288,2,B000JU8HKG,"I'm sorry girls but I didn't like this one, the instructer is just a little to peppy, and the ladies following her just look like manicanes. Not just that but it wasn't as hard as I like it, I perfer to sweat up a storm, also some of the moves I have never seen before and didn't feel like they were working anything. Definitly, the cardio part was way to low impact for me I perfer a heart pumping working this one is more just movement. The band was different but I also didn't feel like it worked too much. Also, the lightening, and backgrounds, and the way it was shot was a little cheesy. I also own the Women's Health Wedding Workout and it is awesome it really makes you sweat and incorpartes alot athletic moves. So far it's my fave!",1184716800,2,741,4.225352112676056
2679289,5,B000JU8HKG,"I am definitely not sedentary nor a beginner. I think this workout is GREAT!! No, it's not hard, but that's part of the point - you'll stick with it. And wedding or no, who wants a grump leading your workout? Yeah, it's peppy and fun and isn't that what keeps one coming back! An exercise program does not have to be difficult to be effective and if you're not sweating, maybe that says more about the effort you're putting in than the workout you're doing. As an active woman and an experienced fitness buff, I recommend this workout because it's easy to stick with. In my opinion, consistency is more effective than sweat.",1173139200,6,624,4.530973451327434
2679290,3,B000JU8HKG,"The work out wasn't all that great. It gave a few new moves I hadn't seen before, but not all that beneficial. The band was a pain to use and keep on you. I think you should save your money and get a better workout somewhere else.",1170892800,2,230,3.9148936170212765
2679291,5,B000JU8HKG,"I can't believe these other reviews.  One of them sounds like someone was stood up at the alter..haha.  This workout is to get you ready for your wedding day, which is why the instructor, Mia, is so peppy.  It's that time in your life when it's time to get excited, be cheesy, and just feel great.  This workout keeps you moving to fun music and keeps you smiling because you're getting ready for the biggest day of your life.  I love this workout because it's so much fun and you definitely will sweat...I highly recommend it.",1170720000,3,527,4.447916666666667
2679292,2,B000JU8HKG,"Having not worked out for over a year, I did this workout for the first time and didn't even break a sweat. I can only see it being useful for beginning exercisers who are extremely sedentary. Also, the instructor is irritatingly peppy (""Throw those bouquets, girls!"") Ugh. I recommend the Women's Health Wedding Workout instead; it's much more challenging, especially for upper-body toning.",1169856000,2,391,5.222222222222222
2679293,2,B000JU8HKG,"This workout disappointed me.  The cadence of the workout was varying speeds (many times not matching the music), the counts of repetitions were off more than once, and the energy level was quite low.  I definitely had better workouts - Crunch pilates series.  If you are interested, rent through Netflix, do not buy.",1169510400,5,317,4.943396226415095
2679294,4,B000JU8HKG,"This is the best workout on DVD I have ever purchased.  I have been using this DVD for 2 weeks & have found it to be an intense workout.  I have already lost 6lbs & can actually see a difference in how firm I am becoming. I am getting married June 1, 2007 & I am going to look dynamite in my wedding dress.",1169424000,,306,3.765625
2679295,2,B000JU8HKG,"I was unfortunately very disappointed with this workout, if you can even call it that. It was very elementary and the product description should warn buyers of that. All three segments are very short and not very concentrated. I definitely don't see myself shedding many pounds or toning up much with this one. I think the book is much better!",1168819200,3,343,4.733333333333333

8153060,3,B000JU8HKG,"This is good if you don't want to actually spend money on hiring a trainer.  If you have enough motivation on your own and are a self starter I would recommend this DVD.  However, to really get in the shape you want to be for your wedding, you will need to do more than just Buff Brides....",1243036800,,290,4.0701754385964914
8153061,4,B000JU8HKG,"I'm amazed that the reviews for this DVD are so bad.  I was using 5 pounds weights and I worked up a sweat.  I'm not a beginner to exercise either so it's definitely not because I'm out of shape.  I liked that the moves involved both upper and lower body at once and combined cardio and strength training.

I didn't find the trainer to be too peppy but maybe it's because I've used many exercise videos in the past.  I wouldn't say this workout is super difficult but it definitely works your body and I think if you do it for the recommended 3 days a week, you'll get results.  I'll update as I continue to use it to let you know my results since this was only my first time using it.  I just wanted to write a positive review since I feel like this DVD is much better than the reviews are showing.",1240012800,,799,4.116129032258065
8153062,2,B000JU8HKG,You would have to be a serious couch potatoe to get any kind of challenge from this video. Not to mention it's C-H-E-E-S-Y!! I could do it more than once and feel good about myself. I was better off doing 20 girl push ups.,1231113600,,222,4.068181818181818
8153063,2,B000JU8HKG,"This DVD offers only a so-so workout, it's nothing special. I didn't feel like I'd worked my body much by the time I was done.  Also, unless you're into having to learn choreography to get a workout this is not the DVD for you.  There's not as much as there is on some DVD's I've seen, but there's enough to throw off your workout and keep you from getting full benefit.  The only other comment I have is that the band that came with my DVD was nothing like that used in the workouts.  Mine was much thinner, plus it was a lot bigger around, which meant that I had to keep finding ways to try to fold it or wrap it around my ankles to try to achieve even minimum resistance.  All in all, if you're only going to get one DVD to get in shape for your wedding, my best advice would be to keep looking.  Believe it or not, I tried a beginning yoga DVD after this (I've never tried yoga before) - boy, did I get a workout!",1199923200,2,917,4.010989010989011
8153064,1,B000JU8HKG,"I was very disappointed in this workout.  Mia does not cue well at all.  She cues on the move, not before and several times says she's going to ""put it all together"", but she introduces new moves instead.  Also, when she couts down to a change in moves, she will count with the left leg leading, but then begin the move on the right leg and vice versa.  The cardio is not intense at all and way too short.  The toning segments are better, but still not great.  The toning band that is included is of  poor quality.  It's too long to use as is, but if I double it up (as recommended on a card included with the workout), then it's too short.  I'm sorry I purchased this one.",1199145600,,673,4.115384615384615
8153065,1,B000JU8HKG,I watched the video and thought that it was a little entertaining but not a great workout.  It's a little cheesy.  It might be good for someone that has never worked out as it is an easy workout.,1196553600,,195,4.105263157894737
8153066,2,B000JU8HKG,"I purchased this DVD hoping it would help me lose the 20 lbs I needed to get off before my wedding - what a mistake.  I'm not an ""exercise queen"" but this workout didn't really even get my heart rate up.  I tried it several times just to be sure, but, no, it's true, this workout will not turn you into a ""buff"" bride - don't waste your money.  I joined Curves instead and kicked off those pounds in 6 short months and have kept it off!  Forget ridiculous workouts where you have to swish the gown and toss the bouquet to get a cardio workout.  Give me a break!",1187222400,3,561,4.0636363636363635
