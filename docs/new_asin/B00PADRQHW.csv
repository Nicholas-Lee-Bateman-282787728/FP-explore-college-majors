6791516,5,B00PADRQHW,Cool slasher flick with an actual  story line to it!  Nice looking girls too as an added bonus!,1420502400,2,95,4.222222222222222
6791517,1,B00PADRQHW,Not a good movie at all. There is no steady plot or even some kind of logic to it. It looks like they just threw together some gore and hoped it would take. The film makers really missed the bar on this one. I highly advise staying away from this one.,1424217600,,251,3.9411764705882355
6791518,1,B00PADRQHW,too fake....,1423612800,,12,5.5
6791519,1,B00PADRQHW,"Long story short: This movie was not entertaining. The $4 I spent to watch it could've gone towards something more productive; like waxing my turtle or learning to square dance. While I understand the time and effort along with personal finance it takes to make an independent film, the poor editing, lackadaisical writing, and inexperienced acting left me feeling robbed of my time. It seems amazon video is willing to accept any and all material regardless of it's quality or worth. I was left curious as to why Realm of Souls AKA Lucifer's Crop Circle has a current 6.9 on imdb.com, did the entire cast & crew upvote their project instead of taking the time to create a quasi-watchable film?",1422835200,,694,4.791666666666667
6791520,1,B00PADRQHW,"I would give it a 0 if I could.... The first part is just a cheap porn.... Then you have had acting on top of horrible writing... Terrible movie and I love cheesy horror film but this one wasn't entertaining.
Basically everyone runs around in the woods and dies..... There isn't even a decent plot.",1422662400,,298,4.4363636363636365
6791521,1,B00PADRQHW,"Well, I should have stopped when the gore required that the girl lose her pants and bra before meeting her ultimate end. I like horror, and I don't mind gore, but this was just bad. I have to admit, I stopped 75% of the way through because I was just so bored. Maybe if I had stuck it out some sort of plot would have developed? If you want to see lots female semi-nudity covered in blood, this is for you. If you want a horror movie with a semblance of a plot, look elsewhere.",1421107200,6,477,4.031578947368421
6791522,4,B00PADRQHW,Well made FF film - appreciated the creative scene transitions along with the steady hand which made this film a pleasure to watch.  Lately I find myself annoyed by all the shaky camera work in the ff films hitting Amazon.  It's such a relief to see the folks involved with this film realize that it can still be a ff film and without the jittery camera.  Big Thanks.  The story held my attention as did the dedicated group of fine actors who committed to this project.  All were professional and talented.  Can't wait to see what else comes out from these folks.  Well done.,1421020800,,575,4.471153846153846
6791523,2,B00PADRQHW,Couldn't hold my attention. No idea what it is about.  Someone different on the screen every time I looked up. Waste of money.,1420934400,,126,4.478260869565218
6791524,1,B00PADRQHW,Absolutely stupid. No plot - no scare. Just bore and gore.,1420934400,3,58,4.363636363636363
6791525,1,B00PADRQHW,"This was such a waste of money and time.  We didn't finish it because couldn't manage to watch any more.  Don't spend your money on this movie,  If there was a negative star I would give it that.",1420848000,2,195,4.078947368421052
6791526,5,B00PADRQHW,A horror movie with a story that thinks outside the box - has non-linear flow kind of like Trick r Treat - you actually have to put the pieces together as you go along for the ride (while good looking people get killed)  a fun ride and a fun movie!,1420675200,2,248,3.96
8687181,1,B00PADRQHW,"Realm of Souls is a wholesome... nah!  Realm of Souls is a movie about four filmmakers who visit several haunted locations in Georgia.  It's a found footage type of horror so that automatically means it's less interesting than a normal horror film.  I'll never understand why these movies have become so popular.  It's baffling!  They're almost always bad.  We see a sexual act take place in the first scene.  Four teens do each other around and inside tents.  And they all get stabbed!  I like when the first couple get stabbed.  We see the blood dripping out of the woman's mouth and all over the man she's doing but it's not exactly clear how she got stabbed or even *if* she got stabbed, amazingly enough!  It comes across like maybe the man actually got stabbed instead.

After this we're introduced to the filmmakers.  They drive to their location talking about... total nonsense.  They try to talk about ghosts but no, not really.  At least not for the first 5 minutes of the ride.  Then these ""investigators"" talk about demons taking possession of human form.  When they arrive to their destination in Georgia, the group stands around drinking alcohol and talking about paranormal experiences.  They treat their arrival as a party scene.

Later the group walks around town discussing how they're going to communicate with the spirits.  A man discusses if we believe in the physical representation of our soul, and if so it must go somewhere.  Okay, it's getting a little better.  I want to mention something before I go on.  This movie likes to rely on strange camera flashing/brief snippets of footage as we see the group of investigators travel from one area of the city to another, and it's fairly annoying.  We also hear a generic horror sound whenever this occurs.  While visiting a graveyard the group says they see something standing by a grave, but we don't see anything.  We see a brief image of something white standing when the investigators rewind the footage though.

Boy this movie is really horrible.  This group has nothing constructive to say AT ALL during their investigations.  They even compare landmarks to sexual objects and joke about it.  It gets worse- they actually explain a certain sexual references to a woman because she doesn't get it.  They take time to explain it in detail.  This is a 1-star movie so far.  The group often turns into the camera to discuss the areas they're investigating, and doing so lacks the horror factor in a big way.

They want to investigate a big circle where nothing grows and the devil comes out called the devil's tramping ground.  Basically when you go inside the circle you let the devil out.  They later mention that nothing stays in the circle, and that things get thrown out of it.  The investigators/filmmakers (whichever one you want to refer to them as) also bring up a technicality that allowed a rapist to be released and a bus load of kids hiking to camp, but... this is a found footage movie, and a messy one at that, so this is just nonsense talk with no conclusion to these stories.  Just a party scene for the group to have fun.

Some of these filmmakers are reluctant to go through with the investigation and this causes mild anger amongst the others.  For a second it looks like this movie is trying to be serious!  A couple investigators venture out alone, and one thinks he hear chanting.  I get the feeling the females in this group could care less about ghosts with one even saying she doesn't believe in any of it.  The females also come across as dimwitted and sleazy.

For a while the group talks about nonsense while setting up their cameras and making camping grounds in the woods.  Finally something scary!  They show camera footage of a demonic voice pushing chairs over, and when the female investigators talk about the devil and circle she asks questions and they feel a strange jolt!  When the group goes out and investigates the chairs... they're missing.  Now the footage suddenly shows two females of the group about to make out with each other but backing out at the last second.  In a cheesy moment the footage shows the tent disappearing.  Their reactions are so fake!  One girl says ""What happened?"" in a casual way, lol.

At least when the group is lost in the woods they hear odd chanting, and then the camera dies.  They ask the demon questions such as ""Were you trapped against your will?""  One girl keeps saying ""This is not right!"" ""We have to get out of here!"" referring to the way it feels at the given moment.  A demon makes a weird whistling/sucking sound and the camera goes down again.  You see, Realm of Souls idea of horror so far is mainly about showing the investigators looking at camera footage as they stand around watching these cameras in the woods.  By the second half of the movie it gets harder to tell the camera footage from what's really happening in the present!

On camera one man says a girl of the group was with him one minute but gone the next.  Other investigators had similar experiences when they returned alone without the rest of the group.  This implies something in the woods it taking people away.  We see footage of one woman being stabbed on the ground.  Her screams sound fake and the camera bouncing around is really lame.  More investigators get stabbed viciously on the ground.  We see one of the investigators doing the stabbing- the black-haired girl.  At least I think so!  I *think* she was part of the investigator/filmmaker crew earlier.  Too many characters makes the story a big sloppy mess!  Anyway she likes licking the blood off her knife.  Meanwhile a pretty song plays while this is happening... pretty bad that is.

Meanwhile other investigators look around the woods lost and confused with the blonde female questioning what to do.  Turns out the black-haired girl didn't kill that guy like it appeared and spared his life.  I don't get that part at all though.  Poor blondie gets her pants ripped down as she tries to crawl away from the killer, but of course, she's destined to be pulled in.  She runs through the woods with her you-knows hanging out and in her panties before being stabbed.  The investigators come up with an idea- they decide to roam through the woods in search of the other investigator and return in an hour, but the crazy woman is right behind them.

One of the female investigators is told to stay behind to keep an eye on the footage, but her lack of caring about this whole investigation means she can't stick around very long and has to go for a walk.  And during this walk she's done for by the black haired stab-happy woman.  We don't see the killing though- we just get the silly jump scare showing the blood-soaked crazy lady appearing with loud effects to boot before the camera jumps to the investigators roaming around in the woods.

These investigators hear more chanting which can only mean something bad is about to happen.  LOL!  The scene with the one investigator wanting to hurry up and leave but the female encouraging him to stay, and actually telling the guy she'll show him her breasts if he stays.  He agrees, lol.  But when she does blood squirts all over her chest as the guy is cut from behind.  The acting is beyond bad by both the man and woman, and it doesn't stop there!  The guy who says ""I told you, the girls are mine!"" is weak in his role.  I don't even know who he is.  He's just a bad guy who appeared out of nowhere.  At least the breast-exposing girl gets what's coming to her.

You know what's also annoying about this movie?  That terrible screamer metal music we hear.  I can't stand hearing that crap.  It takes away from the horror in a big way.  There was a time when metal singers would actually sing instead of imitating the cookie monster.  One of the female investigators stumbles across kids and they too are horrible in their acting.  These are the kids from the camp from the story that was never explained earlier.  They say ""Everyone who comes here has to be punished"".  They can't be more punished than the viewers!  We're the ones feeling the worst of this.

The way characters are killed is a big mess.  Things just happen whenever.  The poor acting, poor story, not knowing who the killers are or why they're doing it and lack of anything noteworthy just destroys this movie.  By the end the chanting we hear, an indication of something bad looming, is more of a mockery since you know it'll only lead to more hilarious character killings.  Late into the story, the remaining characters just roam around the woods not really concerned or frightened about the killings their fellow investigators had to go through.

That horrible cookie monster song plays *again* with the deceiving ""Walk This Way""-like (Aerosmith) guitar riff to start it after another investigator gets stabbed from behind.  WHY WON'T THIS MOVIE END!  We're over 90 minutes in.  If the movie's trying to capture what it's really like to be lost in the woods and the time it takes to finally get out, well done!  LOL!  The woman who shakes her head and moves rapidly around the woods.  You think this is frightening but trust me, it's nowhere near frightening.  It's hilarious!  And suddenly after this we see a woman stumble into the road, a car pulls over, realizes the girl has been through a traumatic ordeal and they get her some help.  Or so they think!  She kills them and throws their bodies alongside the road.  Wow, just really awful.  That's it.

I find it funny these actors and actresses are better in their role in the beginning when they're just having silly conversations and acting like party animals, and then during the scarier portions later on when the story gets serious their weak acting abilities are *truly* revealed.  It's hard figuring out who the bad people actually are.  Are they people who've been living in the woods?  Or are they investigators who turned against their group?  It's hard to make out who's who given the abundance of terrible characters and the darkness of the woods.  But the most confusing part is trying to figure out what's reviewed camera footage and what's actually happening.  The story and horror is mostly found in the investigators reviewing their camera footage.  That's how the movie tells more than half of the story.  Weird and awful movie.",1497052800,,10320,4.658157602663707

8687187,3,B00PADRQHW,"The story is a multi-layered amalgamation of traditional third person point-of-view, found footage and supernatural-with the classic killer-in-the-woods amping things up. It sounds complicated, and a bit too much, and in most cases these attempts are just that. There is often incoherent story arcs, schizophrenic scene changes, etc., something that Smith managed-for the most part-to avoid with Realm Of Souls. The story manages to stay together and move forward as intended. There are some sticky points that sort of irked me, the constant switching between the genre film styles at this rate of transition does distract some from the intense chilling atmosphere at times.

The special effects and creature make-up both are nicely accomplished through practical and standard CGI-only what is necessary to tell the supernatural aspect of the story. There is plenty of gore, blood splatter, and screams in Realm Of Souls to entertain most horror fans, provided you get past the cinematic choices that Smith takes to bring this nightmare to life. I hung in there and I am glad. Although the points I mentioned that bothered me-really bothered me, every time the dark, creepy horror took over in the film I felt satisfied. The kills are delightful in this one. Blunt, visceral, and gruesome.

Overall Realm Of Souls is a worthy effort to create a more interesting found footage ghost story. Chase Smith takes a chance and on many levels it works to his good. The story is fluid, layered, and dark. The blood and guts get a B from me, although I think he could have upped the ante with more graphic, splatter flick kill sequences. The soundtrack is hit or miss with some good instrumental and music choices pushing against a few really bad ones that just didn't fit the scene or enhance the moment, other than that Realm Of Souls is one that I will watch again.",1431216000,,1858,4.932907348242812

8687190,1,B00PADRQHW,"OK - well, I've reviewed hundred of movies and I have to say this is the most confusing mess of a film I've yet come across. The film opens with some admittedly eye-catching T&A (in fact, I'd call it borderline soft core porn), and a very lame killing... of those things I am sure.

After that point, the film becomes an utterly chaotic mess of camera angles, lenses, jumps between past and present, and a mix of bad acting, and some decently improvised dialogue. I described it this morning to a friend of mine like this: it's like the director and the director of photography took their plan, strapped it to a hand grenade, and tossed it in the editing bay, then used that as their shooting schedule.

Bottom line: From what I could gather, there are zero scares or thrills, but plenty of bad acting, really bad camera work, and no identifiable plot. In reading a lot of the reviews, it seems most folks had the same experience I did. I'm going to watch it again, as I unfortunately paid for it, and if I am able to make sense of it, I'll edit this review.

It's been a few hours since I watched it, and I still have no idea what happened.",1425772800,3,1141,4.322429906542056
