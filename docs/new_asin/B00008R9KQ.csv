1858563,5,B00008R9KQ,"Think of a redneck Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor, and you have Red Green. This is one of those shows thats stupid and pointless, but really funny if thats what your into. If your into like Mel Brooks, Farrely Bros. and others like that, youll enjoy this show. He fixes everything with duct tape, and suggests you change the oil in your car every year or two. To use a quote from the show, ""Remember, if the ladies don't find ya handsome, atleast have them find ya handy!""",1056067200,3,467,4.318181818181818
1858564,5,B00008R9KQ,"If you've missed these episodes or, like me, your taped copies have gotten so worn they no longer work, buy this DVD! (and the other 4 that have been released so far).
At first, I was sorta disappointed because the episodes are not in any order, you might get a first season ep followed by a tenth season epidode, then a 3rd, etc... but, no one says you have to watch them in the order they are on the DVD's... the thing is, this is the handiest way to get episodes.
The 8 episodes on this dvd are: The Wind-Powered Boat, The Salt And Pepper Shakers, Maple Syrup, Fire Brigade (my favorite on the dvd), The Beef Project, The Network Deal (my least favorite of all time), and The Science Fair.
I've been a fan since the first season, and have seen every episode at least 200 times over the years, Red Green got me through a lot of troubles in life, because no matter what, you can count on the guys at possom lodge to give you a laugh or two, and it's good to have these eps on DVD format.  I just wish they had been released by season, instead of just, apparently, Steve Smith's favorite episodes.",1052956800,20,1097,4.248803827751196
1858565,5,B00008R9KQ,"Most reviews about Red Green are by men. Not very many are made by 24 year old women from the USA's Deep South. At least, that's where I was living when I discovered Red Green on my local PBS station. I can count on one  hand the number of television shows that will make me laugh until i have to  wipe my eyes, every episode. This is DEFINATELY one of them. Unfortunately  I live in a place with no Red Green now. I haven't met a single person who  knows who he is, or about the show. But, I'm building my own collection  now. So should you! There's something truly wonderful about getting your  friends together and showing them something new, that makes them laugh  their tushes off.

1858639,5,B00008R9KQ,"I agree with the other posting - please keep putting the full seasons out. I had a lot of these episodes on VHS tapes. But, as VHS is basically no longer and I don't use my tape machine much anymore - and the tapes are old - well the DVD's are so much better!!!

I own all of the Red Green DVD's they have out. I love this show. I reminds me of my childhood days when we would head up to Canada during the summer. Our family owned a lodge on a small island. And, a lot of this reminds me of the men (mostly my dad) in my life(past and present). I love the humor. It is classic funny humor. Hard to find these days! No need for cuss words or bleeping in these episodes.

I will be buying the 2000 season when it comes out! And I will keep buying the seasons until they are all out! I just wish they would put the seasons before they went to the CBC out on DVD's. I know some of the episodes are in the SixPack box set, but only a few. I loved the older episodes as well.

1858641,5,B00008R9KQ,"The only drawback to this season is that Harold (in my opinion the funniest one of the lot) is no longer a central character and appears only in occasional segments. But these segments, where Red goes to visit Harold at his job in the city, are some of the funniest exchanges ever, as roles reverse and a newly confident Harold frequently gives Red his comeuppance. You also have the benefit of the Ranger Gord educational cartoons. I really can't describe these--you have to see them. The episode ""Too Much Information"", in which Red takes on the Internet age, is worth the price of the collection on its own; every single segment is side-splittingly funny.",1209600000,,658,4.780701754385965
1858642,5,B00008R9KQ,This is great fun thank you. Red Green is a lot of fun and we have all had Duct Tape moments. Long live Red Green & Possum Lodge. Thank You.,1207440000,,140,3.7
1858643,5,B00008R9KQ,"This is the famous, ""Man's Prayer"" from the start of each Possum Lodge meeting on ""The Red Green Show"". And this is a review of this great DVD set.

This is the 1999 or the 9th season of the show; For those of you who have the wonderful ""Stuffed and Mounted Series"", this set contains 5 episodes (all on disk number three of this set) that you will already have. They are; in order:

""The Battle Call""- Possum Lodge and Caribou Lodge lock horns in mock combat.  (Stuffed & Mounted #6)

""Hurricane Doug"" - A powerful hurricane bears down on the lodge.  (Stuffed & Mounted #5)

""Guinness World Records""- The men scramble to find a way into the record book. (Stuffed & Mounted #4)

""The Auto Club"" - The guy's form an auto club to earn cash.  (Stuffed & Mounted #3)

""Too Much Information"" - Everyone gets sucked into the computer craze- except Red. (Stuffed & Mounted #2)

Also worth mentioning; this is the year that Patrick McKenna (Harold) left for Hollywood and movie fame; so his roll on the show was limited accordingly. He was able to record smaller segments, usually with himself and Steve Smith (Red); where Red goes to his place of business, (an office building) where they talk about various subjects; such as lodge business or how Harold is adjusting to city life, etc. On one episode ""The Bachelor Auction"" Harold actually shows up at the end of the episode at the lodge; as a contestant.

Rick Green (Adventures with Bill) also left the program for a short while starting with this season. Rick started the Canadian comedy series ""History Bites"" in 1999. There is a similar segment in each episode during this season of The Red Green Show. It's filmed in black & white and Red still does the narration just like in the previous ""Adventures with Bill"" segments; but it's filmed with other lodge members, Dalton Humphrey, Mike Hamar and Ed Frid to name a few.

Anyway; to make up for Harold's limited appearances on the show, we get to see more of Dalton, Mike, Edgar Montrose, Winston Rothchild III (from ""Rothchild's Sewage and Septic Sucking Services""). Hap Shaughnessy and Ranger Gord have bigger roles now too.

Sadly this is Hap Shaughnessy's (Gordon Pinsent) last year on the show; Gordon left after this season.

This is also the season that started the famous ""Ranger Gord Cartoons"".

Here what's on each disk....

Disk One

""Harold's Job""- Harold moves to the city and takes a corporate job.

""The Fishing Derby""- The men have the lake tested when the fish stop biting.

""Lady In Red""- A beautiful young chiropractor sets up shop in town.

""The Bachelor Auction""- The men auction themselves to raise money- and get dates.

""Angel""- The guys bet about whether Mike can show them an angel.

""School Bus Blimp""-Red and the gang turn an old school bus into a hot air balloon.

Disk Two

""Coupe De Gras""- Red invents grass that grows only two inches high.

""Rent A Wreck""- Mike Borrows Red's van to take part in a demolition derby.

""Curse Of The Mummy""- Red and Mike fool around with museum artifacts.

""Roll Out The Barrels""- Red decides to go over the falls in a beer barrel.

""No Retreat""- Harold's company wants to buy the lodge for retreats.

Disk Three

""The Battle Call""
""Hurricane Doug""
""Guinness World Records""
""The Auto Club""
""Too Much Information""

Even though there are five out of the sixteen episodes already on the ""Stuffed and Mounted"" series; in this release, I think this is still worth owning. Remember; after the 10th season (2000 set); there won't be anymore repeat shows; since the Stuffed & Mounted series only includes episodes from 1991 to 2000. So show your support and buy this. Hopefully we will see many more of these seasons released (including the early ones) as years go by and ""Remember I'm pulling for ya' were all in this together"".",1206144000,17,3783,4.694992412746585

Although it's humor is aimed towards middle-aged men, I think anyone (including myself-a female in her 20's) can appreciate it. It's kind of like Tool Time (from Home Improvement) meets Bob Villa but crossed with goofiness and humor. This DVD pack is great because it really does have a ton of episodes on it.

The one big complaint I have with this release is the DVD cases - I'd rather see the thin-pack cases used for a ""pack"" of DVDs such as this.  This saves space on bookshelves, store shelves, and allows the production company to ship more units per case.

All that aside, I'd also like to see the entire series come to DVD.  While there certainly were some poor episodes, I'd like to see all of the episodes make their way to DVD, as season releases, or one big mega-pack, like the sort of thing A&E does with some of their shows.",1136073600,6,598,4.219298245614035
1858678,5,B00008R9KQ,"The Red Green Show is the most consistently funny program I have ever had the pleasure to watch.  The show's format, which changed slightly over the series 15 year run, is as predictable and comfortable as your favorite slippers.  Yes, I know before the episode begins that whatever crazy scheme Red has concocted this week will inevitably fail -- but that is part of the fun.  And I know that whoever is playing the ""Possum Lodge Word Game"" this week will certainly and inadvertently guess the answer.
(...)
Finally any middle aged man with a smidgen of a funny bone will love Red's weekly homily on being a guy, and getting older.  His comments are wickedly insightful, always laugh inducing, and often startlingly thought-provoking.

This series is the ultimate guy show, but never demeans women or slips into macho posturing.  Instead it takes an hilarious and insightful look at maleness, exposing the quirks of our gender with loving satire.  My face breaks out in a wide smile as soon as Red walks into the lodge in the opening sequence.  Yes its silly, yes its predictable, and yes it is beloved by those who have taken the time to savor its gentle humor.  So bow your head for the man's prayer, and join the fun.",1135641600,12,1221,4.668224299065421

Or how to remove two badgers from old man Sedwick's overalls? How about brewing your own beer from an old water tower. And Uncle Red's handyman quotes such as...If it ain't broke, your not trying.

1858682,5,B00008R9KQ,"Red Green is living proof that comedy can be clean and safe for the whole family. If you're like my family and prefer to keep the trash and smut away from your TV but love a good comedy, check this out. Blows SNL out of the water in the humor department.",1114819200,8,254,4.0
1858683,5,B00008R9KQ,Please don't be fooled by the fact that they show this on public television. This show is my favorite next to Seinfeld and Inavder Zim. Its humor ranks up with those tv shows too! It is no doubt a very differant kind of humor but hilarious. A more family friendly version of bluc collar comedy. Invest in laughs!,1106352000,,312,4.396551724137931
1858684,4,B00008R9KQ,"The is a must have for die-hard Red Green fans.  48 of the best episodes from various seasons.  It's great to watch the show evolve over the years.  Interestingly though, they did not order the episodes in chronological order.

The only disapointment was that there are no episodes from the second season (eps 25 - 48) with the big ensemble cast (Noel, Eddie, Helmut, Doc, etc).",1084924800,16,378,4.681818181818182
1858685,5,B00008R9KQ,"The 6 dvds are well worth the money. I was really disappointed with the Red Green movie ""Duct tape forever"". With one half of the comedy troupe THE FRANTICS writing/staring on the Red Green show,it really was very funny.[Rick Green,Peter Wildman]I think it was funnier back then than it is on the CBC  right now.",1082160000,5,312,4.672727272727273
1858686,5,B00008R9KQ,"We've been in love with the Red Green Show since the 1st episode we happened across on our local PBS station. The comedy series is genuine and very original. I can't recommend these enough. Red Green is FANTASTIC and great comedy for the whole family. Even my 4 and 7 year old love to watch the Red Green Show and that's saying something because they hardly ever watch anything that isn't animated.
A must have if you love to laugh.",1067385600,25,432,4.4125
1858687,4,B00008R9KQ,"What can one say about Red Green, et al, that hasn't been said?  Some of the best comedy ever, IMHO.
However, the sound quality on these DVDs is rather frustrating.
It cycles from very loud to rather soft over a 20-30 second time frame on almost every episode.  Whoever did the mastering should have their toy box taken away and fed gruel for the rest of their lives.  Up and down, up and down... sheesh!",1061337600,26,404,4.36
