8601394,3,B00E5G0370,"Okay, number one - the box cover was misleading.  At no time does the vampire ever look like that (eyes/claws).  It is pretty much a family-friendly after school vampire in high school movie.  Vampire (!spoiler - actually 1/2 vampire - spoiler!) goes out in daytime with lots of sunscreen on.  Guy is a girl magnet, of course.  Silly sub-plot with occult store owner selling vampire killing stuff to his step-sister and her friends.  Another silly sub-plot with the supposed great-great-great grandson of a Van Helsing/Renfield hook-up who is already under mental care.  Not a bad movie for pre-teens and just-teens, just not Twilight-worthy in a no-bodies kinda fashion.",1418688000,,671,5.157407407407407
8601395,1,B00E5G0370,it's my fault----------- I tought it would be a good movie it was a bad one,1418515200,,75,3.75
8601396,3,B00E5G0370,"I've SEEN better, and I'll----sure as hell---SEE worse, but,----from the TITLE alone----
you'll probably figure out that there are NO Academy Award-winning performances in
this piece of entertainment.

I bought this title, recently, along with another five sci-fi ""B""-movies. I spent---on average---
$5, apiece. Of course, some were MORE, and some were LESS. This was enjoyable---to
me---in a ""TV-monster-movie of the week"" kinda way. It wasn't ""TWILIGHT"", but I think
that T-H-A-T is a G=O=O=D thing!

Fangs a lot, and Happy Hallowe'en, eh?!",1410998400,,542,5.518072289156627
8601397,2,B00E5G0370,"What can I say? Cute idea badly done. Let me say a few positive things first. The best lines come from the cat, truly. Judson Birza as Victor the main character has some promise, I think but don't judge him by this movie same goes for Nick Galarza as Jimmy.  Lauren Greg as Lucy...very cute and does a pretty good job. Seth Austin as the loopy crazy kid, Renny Van Helsing is way over the top but oddly fun and sometimes funny. William McNamara not too bad as the Dad, Tracy Nelson is pretty bad as the Mom, Lynn Lowry as the Gestapo Principal of the school...truly awful. Joseph Rich as Mitch is pathetic he comes off as an idiot. finally, the lead female, Shae Landers, never let her perform EVER again. Bad, bad actress with disturbingly skinny legs (sorry it was distracting). the dialog is so bad and the conversations so forced it was making me uncomfortable. You have been warned.",1398124800,2,887,4.4753086419753085
8601398,4,B00E5G0370,"This film was cheesy, but not terrible.  The storyline was fresh and added a new dimension to vampire lore.  The acting was amateurish, but enjoyable.  A fun family movie.",1388102400,4,171,4.827586206896552
