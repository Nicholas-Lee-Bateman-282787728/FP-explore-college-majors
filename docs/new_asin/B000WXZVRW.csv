2993037,5,B000WXZVRW,"Every dog pound and Humane Society should have this available to save dog/owner relationships. So many dogs get the shaft because their humans really don't know how to work with their dogs successfully.

I thought I was a clutz with our old dogs and the new dog;  in literally 5 minutes, we had the three pooches lined up and doing the sit.  Then, come, stay and the rest in a week.  We got instant results.  Even a shy dog will catch on.  The trainer knows both how dogs think and how people goof up, so seeing the mistake and successes helped us.",1214092800,9,548,4.323529411764706

8226033,2,B000WXZVRW,"DVD was damaged and huge chunk was not watchable. It looked like it was okay from what I saw, but too much was missing.",1446249600,,119,4.0
8226034,5,B000WXZVRW,"I buy a lot of helpful tips books for my dogs.  No, they don't read!  I do!  ;-))  This book gave me some really helpful tips but I don't think I will accomplish everything in five days!  If you want some information about training a dog this is helpful.  I also liked the tone and attitude of the trainer.  Thank you.",1304812800,2,318,4.114754098360656
8226035,3,B000WXZVRW,"Jean Donaldson takes her teachings very seriously, almost too seriously.  I learned a few things but not any more that I could learn for free on the internet.",1301875200,2,158,4.642857142857143
8226036,5,B000WXZVRW,"I've been a professional dog trainer since 2002 and this is the best training video I've ever seen. Jean Donaldson is world renowned and I've attended workshops that she's given. If you can't afford to pay for a pro to give you lessons, this is the next best thing.",1268352000,4,265,4.428571428571429
8226037,3,B000WXZVRW,"DVD was nicely done, easy to follow. Jean teaches dog owners how to connect with their dog and teach simple commands (sit, stay, come, down, heel, etc). Using her techniques, within two weeks, we got our 16 week old puppy to sit, stay, and come. He is now six months old and we are still working on come, down, heel, still using her techniques. We have followed them as directed. I guess some dogs learn quicker than others, and the same methods do not work for every dog. Overall, good basic DVD for a starter. Would recommend real live trainer for those with obstinate puppies/dogs.",1243123200,,584,4.571428571428571
8226038,4,B000WXZVRW,This was a good program for people who are new to having a dog and teaching them the basics at home.  If you are already going to go to an obedience class you can skip this one.,1238803200,,177,3.7837837837837838
