8014282,3,B0001LYG9O,"If you're a Metal Blade fan, you'll want this.

The quality of sound here is not that bad.  The video tends to be whole-stage shots from a mounted camera, so there are seldom any close-ups.  The interviews are interesting (When asked which band at the show he found the most interesting, Cannibal Corpse's Corpsegrinder Fisher replies ""Cattle Decapitation"").

The performances are good on here, especially Cattle Decap, Cannibal Corpse, and Armored Saint.",1197331200,2,455,5.277777777777778
8014283,5,B0001LYG9O,"this dvd/cd combo is a must for metal fans, the raw, gritty footage  is the basis for it's extreme nature, you will not believe that pure energy given of by the bands on here.

an absolute hidden gem in the world of metal dvds, not to be turned down, you don't get much better than this.",1117238400,,287,4.107142857142857
8014284,1,B0001LYG9O,"This DVD is completely amateur and very disappointing. Although I'm sure these bands delivered great performances at the actual show, all of the concert footage is filmed from only ONE camera angle. And the only camera is so far away from the stage, you can barely make out anyone who's playing. Not to mention the audio is also lousy. It's like Metal Blade hired someone's cousin to videotape this thing. . .
Oh, and the bonus CD of live songs is horribly mastered, too.",1080000000,18,471,4.619047619047619
