6023268,5,B00FR23O4U,so far I have all 10 seasons  I have always like the Grey's Anatomy shows,1435968000,,73,3.8666666666666667
6023269,4,B00FR23O4U,"I have watched a lot of shows from the beginning to the end and have to say I have NEVER seen a show focus a whole season on one leaving cast member.  I am glad the show did it though; it was done very well and, thus, when Cristina left we were NOT sad for her, but glad she had achieved her dreams.

Essentially, the show had been informed that Sandra Oh was leaving the show, so we get to learn the ins and outs of Cristina.

In this season, Cristina and Owen often have sex and try to make it work, but it simply cannot work because Cristina does NOT want children EVER.  Owen meets a woman who wants to marry him and have children, but he doesn't want a wife that will quit her job voluntarily for him.  It would seem to me that Owen wants a surgeon who ends up quitting her job once the children overwhelm her.

In this season Cristina and Meredith often fight and make up; they realize their lives have gone in separate directions.  Meredith has become the person that neither of them thought they would be: wife, mother, surgeon.  Cristina has become the person they both wanted to be: a Harper Avery nominee.  Though their lives are going in separate directions, they both agree they are each other's person.

Meredith and Derrick are juggling parenthood and surgery careers.  In this season, Derrick is often missing from the show.  The writers don't seem to have a lot of storylines left for Derrick.  Derrick decides to move to Washington DC to work with the NIH and his sister, Amy, comes to the hospital and ""takes over his service.""  Before Cristina left, she told Meredith: ""Derrick is Dreamy, but you are the sun;"" don't let him put you in his shadow.

Leigha Murphy is an intern who has a lot of incidents this season: a saw went through a person's leg, she laughs inappropriately at patients, and belches at inopportune times.  Weber finally tells Leigha that she is not surgeon material and she is let go.

Shane Ross is the intern that mainly works with Yang.  He is asked to go check on Weber in the boiler room, instead, he sends another intern.  The intern dies and, as a result of guilt, Shane has a breakdown in a surgery and almost kills a person.  From then on, he is known as the intern with mental issues.  He ends up going with Yang to Zurich.

Alex Karev has a lot of student loan debt and his father is the patient killed by Shane in surgery.  An anal surgeon offers him (Alex) the opportunity to buy into a partnership.  Alex decides to do it, but it doesn't work out because private practice is sink or swim.  Essentially, Alex had to solicit patients or he wouldn't have a paycheck.  I am not sure, but I think Alex ended up back at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.  In my opinion, Alex's character really has no place on the show anymore.

Joe Wilson and Alex become engaged.  Both had troubled childhoods and find they are compatible and would be good together.

Stephanie Edwards and Jackson Avery are together and there is no chemistry.  April is getting married to Matt, the EMT.  At the wedding, Avery proposes to April and they run off and get married.  April gets pregnant shortly thereafter.

Callie and Robbins want another baby.  In my opinion, the storylines with these two have run their course.  Anyway, by the end of the season, they decide to use a surrogate because Torres has adhesions and cannot carry a child.  Robbins, who previously had an affair and has lost a leg, does not think she could take losing another baby (she had a miscarriage during the season).

Bailey is still on the show, presented as a main character, but treated as a side character.  Bailey's husband, Warren, is now doing his residency at Grey Sloan Memorial.  Bailey almost gets in trouble for injecting HIV in a child, but the child heals and the situation resolves itself.  Bailey seems flighty to me.  She started a clinic for the poor and then would NOT run it.  She now wants to be a geneticist and Weber wants her to be a surgeon so the two are disagreeing on that point.

Now, for the star of the show:

The writers show us how Cristina's life would have ended up:
1. With Owen and with children, she would have ended up with two kids and focused on the kids instead of the career; the goal would have been to sacrifice for Owen.

2. Without Owen, she focuses on her career and later she wins the Harper Avery award and as she ages marries Shane.

3. With Owen and without kids, Owen is miserable and she ruins both lives.

Cristina ultimately decides that she and Owen can NOT be together.  Preston Burke appears on the show and owns a hospital in Zurich.  He has Cristina come to the hospital, not dependent on governmental funding, and she takes the job.  Cristina moves to Zurich and Shane goes with her, so it would seem that Shane and Cristina probably will end up together.  Cristina decided to leave Grey Sloan because no one at the hospital will ever win the Harper Avery because the Avery foundation is the majority owner of the hospital and, thus, there is an inherent conflict in anyone from the hospital winning the award.

What we the viewers ultimately learned about Cristina is ALL she careers about is her surgical career; nothing WILL or WILL EVER be as important to her. She needs friends that accept that about her and anyone she marries will have to accept that about her.

What messed up this season is the failure to include Cristina's biological family.  The writers made it seem like she dropped out of the air and did not have a mother, stepfather, and siblings and so forth and, as a result, the only people she said goodbye to worked at the hospital.  This was not a realistic ending.

New character: Cristina chooses the new director of Cardio and it ends up being Weber's daughter by Ellis Gray.",1435708800,2,5759,4.478386167146974

As usual Cristina continues to be selfish and egoistic, while Meredith gets the wisdom on and on. The big surprise is, when Dr. Burke appeared and offered Cristina his hospital, something that she doesn't deserve because of the way she broke her marriage to him. But, maybe this is solely to demonstrate the medicine values and morals Dr Burke has and Cristina hasn't.",1429833600,,643,4.640350877192983
