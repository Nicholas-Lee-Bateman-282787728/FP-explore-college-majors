8289477,5,B001CU7KDC,"I love the Haunted History Series.  They are both informative, gives historical perspectives to the legends of the ghost stories for the locale, and entertaining to boot.  What I like is that they use direct interviews with the alleged witnesses so you can judge for yourself if the story is true or embellished.  The haunted history series are great.",1385596800,,351,4.915254237288136
8289478,3,B001CU7KDC,"Since they are all so expensive, was thrilled to get two episodes of this great series on 1 dvd. . .However, much to my dismay, the narrator for these two episodes is not the delightfully spooky John Glover but is instead Michael Dorn of Star Trek fame. . .I'm sorry, but Mr. Dorn's narration just does not do it for me. . .history channel, please release these films they way the were intended and the way you constantly show them in reruns on History International and Biography. . .with John Glover narrating the episodes.  I swear every time I watch these, I'm expecting Mr. Dorn to suddenly explain to me that the shields have come down or that his klingon honor has somehow been besmirched. . .Not cool History Channel. . .not cool. . .",1299974400,2,742,4.496296296296296
