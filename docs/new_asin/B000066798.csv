1711638,2,B000066798,"This one was made after Disney died, Billy Mummy is too old for the role he plays, and it's often too dark, and it sometimes really drags.  Mummy's scenes--where he's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy--are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard.  Better to buy Charlie the Lonesome Couger, or the one about the Yellowstone Bears or the earlier version of ""The Incredible Journey,"" the one they only have on videotape.",1039046400,5,433,4.917808219178082

1711677,4,B000066798,"I can't believe I just saw this for the first time in 2015. It was made 3 years before I was born. I am actually looking forward to seeing some Disney movies for the first time 2015 onwards, they really take me back to the good old days. For me, they were the good old days. It was interesting to see Bill Mumy in his young teen years, fills in a missing gap in this period of his acting career after his TV work as a younger child. He did a pretty good job too. A lot of great scenery in this movie, outdoors in the autumn. I liked the story and all the characters in it. Even the nagging oldest daughter. A number of good themes were expressed in this movie in ways that weren't melodramatic or sappy, about growing up and facing facts of life. Kind of a Yearling movie in that regard but not as rough and drastic. I, like other reviewers, was expecting more of a plot, though. The movie ended all too abruptly. I thought the main parts of the movie were being led up to and going to start but then suddenly it was over. Still a great entry in this genre and era of movie making which we will never see again. That's OK, most of the best movies ever made have already been made and it will still take a lifetime to see them all.",1435968000,2,1230,4.065843621399177

The scenery is fantastic, and there are many humorous moments that made my sons giggle.  My sons are 4 and 13 and it's not that easy to find a movie that will make them both laugh and will be appropriate for both of them.
I especially love that despite there being some exciting moments, this movie feels lot more mellow than most of modern day movies.  It makes it perfect for my excitable 4-year old.  This one is definitely approved by our whole family.",1400544000,7,651,4.52991452991453

1711715,4,B000066798,"Having read, & never forgotten the touching story of growing up-sprinkled w/adventure , an encapsulated version (from Readers Digest) when young, I wanted to share this book w/my sons. They loved it! Providing the screen adaptation & the book @ home was a nice way to connect over the years-I feel the story will be passed to my grandchildren. The story takes place in a much simpler, yet more fulfilling, time. Neighbors were neighbors, pretty much the whole town was serene. Then along comes Rascal...a raccoon kit abandoned by its mother who is, of course, adopted & cared for by the author/central figure (Sterling North).  Like many Disney characters, one parent (or both-in this case the mother has passed) are missing from the home & Sterlings father is a travelling salesman, so there is little parental influence in the boy's life. Rascal manages to fill some of the void, but is a mischievious  tutor, creating many uproarious situations which teach young Sterling some 'propers'. Eventually Rascal, being guided by natture, must go off on his own. So the tale conveys a message about growing up & humility. While a touching story in many aspects, one must remember that 2 parents are a blessing from above & should have a bit of conversation with the younger viewer/reader regarding this. Worth the time of us older 'kits', too!",1357776000,6,1339,4.920353982300885
1711716,4,B000066798,"Based on Sterling North's classic book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rascal-A-memoir-of-a-better-era/dp/B0006AYNMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rascal,: A memoir of a better era</a>, this is the story of how a lonely boy's pet raccoon unintentionally brings changes to his life and his father's.  Sterling (Bill Mumy) lives in a small town in Wisconsin circa 1914; his mother died suddenly a few months ago, and his father Willard (Steve Forrest), who sells rural real estate all over the Upper Midwest, tends to be away from home more often than not.  Willard has a deep love of nature and has taught his son to share it; one afternoon as they're enjoying the countryside, Sterling's dog Wowser discovers a baby raccoon left behind by its mother, and the boy, aware that there's a lynx in the neighborhood, can't bear to abandon the little thing to its fate, so ""Rascal"" becomes his.  At first the neighbors--Cy Jenkins (John Fiedler), who has a backyard corn patch and a coonhound, and Garth Chadwick (Henry Jones), who raises chickens--are dubious, but Sterling promises to ""de-varmintize"" the raccoon, and at first it seems he may be successful.  Meanwhile, summer vacation is just beginning, and Sterling's older sister Theo (Pamela Toll), who's been keeping house for her father and brother, worries about what will become of Sterling when she has to go back to her job in Chicago, and suggests a regular housekeeper.  But neither of the North men can bear any of the applicants, especially the animal-hating Mrs. Satterfield (Elsa Lanchester), so when Theo does leave, they just soldier on without her, Sterling looking after himself and his pets as best he can.  When Rascal's innocent quest for marshmallows (his favorite treat) leads to the near wreck of the general store, Sterling decides he'll have to turn the animal loose.  But then Garth challenges Walt Dabbett (Richard Erdman) to race his Stanley Steamer against Garth's trotter Donnybrook, and with Rascal--Donnybrook's unofficial mascot--tucked into his shirt he even wins.  Suddenly all mischief is forgiven and Sterling and Rascal are the town's heroes.  But Mother Nature, as Sterling's teacher (Bettye Ackerman) warned him she would, is just waiting for her moment to ""tap [Rascal's] ear.""

Apart from the delightful small-town ambience (probably not too unlike that of Walt Disney's own boyhood), one of the high points of the movie is Forrest's winning performance as a warm-hearted, happy-go-lucky father who hasn't a clue what his long absences are doing to his son.  And of course Rascal and his antics are unmatched.  Be sure to read the book too!",1350691200,,2670,5.3460620525059666

1711723,4,B000066798,"A warm story of a young boy who's father is a single parent, but is gone on travel as a salesman most of the time. The boy is well behaved though, and his love for animals is what gets him in trouble at times. He collects them in a way, but when he brings home a baby raccoon, things really get wild. Naturally when the raccoon grows up, it changes, and that is hard on the boy. I love old Disney films, and this is very nostalgic. But let me warn you, it is a litle slow paced. It is a neat time period, with the cars, clothes and homes. But I agree that people expect to see more fun and action with the raccoon, my son was bored too.
I wish Disney had released this in widescreen or taken the time to add any extras such as theatrical trailers, or footage from their many shows that included animals. Disney made the best animal movies of all time, and they made the most. If you want great animal stories for your kids try other Disney fare such as ""Nikki the Wild Dog of the North"", ""Lobo"", ""Sammy the Way Out Seal"", ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar"", ""The Ugly Dachsund"", ""That Darn Cat"", and many more. Some of these are released as videos under the name Anchor Bay instead of Disney, but they are originally Disney in the theatre.",1295827200,,1234,4.210970464135021

This DVD title is not available in Australia, so it was great to be able to buy it from Amazon in America. This is the first time I've bought a DVD from overseas.(Luckily my DVD player is multi-regional). It only took 16 days from when I ordered on-line for the DVD to arrive in my mailbox here in Australia - for the grand cost of (incl. postage ) AU$16.47! - a fantastic bargain.

1711732,1,B000066798,"As usual, another story about a wild animal taken in and the left in the wild to fend for itself when it grows older.  Same old story.  Boy takes in cute cuddly raccoon.  Racccon starts to make trouble.  Boy is forced to get rid of raccoon instead of finding alternate ways to care for it.  The movie was slow.  Bad acting.  A time waster.

Some people lack committment and responsibility.  Once you give an animal a home, especially a wild one, you should be prepared to make adjustments during its lifetime. I had a raccoon for 13 years, and she lived INSIDE my house.  When she became older, she slept more and did not like going out to play as much. But she was happy and even played with my cat and dogs.  At times she was feisty - but only when she became older.  I took the reponsibility when I rescued her (broken leg, bite marks everywhere) and I owed her the same happiness and treatment she had as when I first found her.  I never threw her back in the wild as she was already used to humans and having food given to her.  She even used a littler box.  It would be dangerous for her and shorten her life span even more.  I hated this movie, the motives, I am sorry I bought it or even had the desire to see it.",1217635200,4,1221,4.131914893617021
1711733,4,B000066798,"""Rascal"" is the true story of a baby raccoon which author Sterling North found when he was 11 years old, and raised until it was time to set the raccoon back in the wild.

This is a sweet story, and the bits which may cause some parents concern in the book itself are not even present in the movie, making it sweeter still.

There are spoken threats to the raccoon (neighbors warn that if the raccoon starts to raid gardens, he will be shot), but it never goes beyond that.

That said, there are scenes where Sterling's father has a dead turkey slung over his shoulder, and another where the plucked turkey is ready to become dinner.

Also, in one scene Sterling's father invites the town's new minister and Sterling's teacher in to dinner, and proceeds to get them drunk on hard cider.

One other matter which may cause concern for some - although it is based on reality - is that Sterling's mother has passed away, and, to compound matters, his father is a travelling entrepreneur, and he often leaves young Sterling at home alone for days on end (it is made clear in the movie that this is not ok, although Sterling's father doesn't seem to see it that way at first).

Finally, there is a scene in the beginning - and one in the end - where the raccoons tangle with a bobcat. Nobody gets particularly hurt, but it might be a bit scary for a few moments for younger children.

If the above are ok for your family, then ""Rascal"" is a very sweet film, and we will be watching it again.

And, oh yes, the fellow who plays Sterling is none other than Bill Mumy - yes, that Bill Mumy, who played Will Robinson in ""Lost in Space"".

1711734,4,B000066798,"I actually have the book on which this film is based, and given the constraints of time, the film script follows the book pretty well.
Billy Mumy was a well-chosen cast member for the principal role.
The film must have been pretty difficult to execute given that an animal
is involved with most of the scenes.
The film is typical of many of the Disney films which can generate empathy
and emotion in the viewer, but do not have any unpleasant scenes disturbing enough to make young viewers cry. It is a very pleasant and
sometimes humorous story of youth growing up in a time gone by.",1200355200,3,584,4.4672897196261685
1711735,4,B000066798,"When a cuddly baby raccoon snuggles his way into the life of a lonely boy named Sterling North (Billy Mumy), things go riotously awry as the ringtail's mischievous nature gets more and more out of control. Everyone in the small town gets to know Rascal, whether they want to or not - the bandit-masked mammal is especially fond of the eggs in the neighbor's chicken coops. Eventually, it's decided that Rascal will have to be returned to the wild. But Rascal doesn't want to go!

Based upon the memoir by Sterling North, the movie suffers from sluggish editing... but that little raccoon is just too cute!

1711736,4,B000066798,"If you are a Procyon Lotor lover, this film is for you. If you're looking for a classic, lively Walt Disney animal film--this one isn't it. The film follows Sterling North's book, and does it well.  Yes, it seems to drag at times, and therefore does not ""meet"" the high action/drama expectations of today's viewers.  But this film was made before the days of high-tech computer animations, and the coons used in it--are real--and therefore a true representation of this wonderful, mischievious critter.  This whole film deals with a raccoon. It is not just a brief ""tease"" scene in a film for us raccoon lovers.",1083283200,12,611,4.8
1711737,3,B000066798,"A warm story of a young boy who's father is a single parent, but is gone on travel as a salesman most of the time. The boy is well behaved though, and his love for animals is what gets him in trouble at times. He collects them in a way, but when he brings home a baby raccoon, things really get wild. Naturally when the raccoon grows up, it changes, and that is hard on the boy. I love old Disney films, and this is very nostalgic. But let me warn you, it is a litle slow paced. It is a neat time period, with the cars, clothes and homes. But I agree that people expect to see more fun and action with the raccoon, my son was bored too.
I wish Disney had released this in widescreen or taken the time to add any extras such as theatrical trailers, or footage from their many shows that included animals. Disney made the best animal movies of all time, and they made the most.  If you want great animal stories for your kids try other Disney fare such as ""Nikki the Wild Dog of the North"", ""Lobo"", ""Sammy the Way Out Seal"", ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar"", ""The Ugly Dachsund"", ""That Darn Cat"", and many more. Some of these are released as videos under the name Anchor Bay instead of Disney, but they are originally Disney in the theatre.",1043712000,25,1235,4.210970464135021
