8324873,5,B0007NZS4S,"This movie is one of my all time favorites and NOT because Brad Pitt is in the movie.  I love the whole message about not settling for second best, waiting to find the right person to share your life with, lightning might strike.  Call me a hopeless romantic, but this movie is about relationships, forgiveness and a family's unconditional love and devotion for each other.  I am glad I did not listen to the critics opinions on this movie, in my opinion they missed the whole point of the message.  To tell the truth I saw this at least six times in the theater and then bought it on VHS, but now DVD is the way to go since our VCR broke.",1209513600,5,639,4.213114754098361
