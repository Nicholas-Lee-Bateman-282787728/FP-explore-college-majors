1636893,5,B00005NSY6,"It is sometimes easier to bury ourselves in fiction and enjoy the glitz of Hollywood rather than face the real issues in our world today.  Marc Singer has made one of the most powerful statements about the joy, suffering and irony of life.  He has used homeless people as a medium, but could have just as well done it using a group of wealthy ""Ladie's who lunch""
Never has a film made me cry, smile and laugh as much.  To follow the lives of individuals who have so little, but are still able to give so much to each other and make the most of the little thay do have.
This is a must see film, that will send you on a roller coaster ride of emotion.  Watch enjoy, and I challenge you not to pick the phone up the minute this has finished to tell all of your friends.",1003449600,,766,4.086666666666667
1636894,5,B00005NSY6,"this has to be the greatest documentary i have ever seen. i saw it for the first time back in january of 2001 at the red vic theater in san francisco ca. this film moved me in many ways. i first decided to watch the film because the soundtrack was completly done by dj shadow, a favorite of mine. the soundtrack added so much to the film, but im sure that it would have still be great even if the soundtrack were done by some loser band like linkin park or limp bizkit. great film, you have to buy it.",1000512000,4,501,4.02
1636895,5,B00005NSY6,This documentary is barebones. And I loved it. It offers no fluff as it literally sheds light into darkness. I was not only entertained but more importantly this doc helped me expand my knowledge of the often overlooked world that the homeless in big cities live in.,1469577600,,266,4.680851063829787
1636896,5,B00005NSY6,"Unsettling, eye-opening. Makes me so extremely grateful for fresh clean water, a clean place to sleep, fresh air, clean food.  Those poor dogs, still breaks my heart.  People should see how people in extreme poverty live.",1467590400,,221,5.111111111111111

1636901,5,B00005NSY6,"I first saw this documentary on Netflix. It takes place in the tunnels of Penn Station in New York City(which is not far from where I live) and delivers a raw look into the homeless community which exists within the tunnels. Its a powerful documentary in my opinion. After the first time I saw it I remembered it and wanted to see it again. Films that effect me that way are far and few in between. I finally purchased this dvd for my movie collection and I couldn't be happier. Its loaded with excellent extras. The extras literally bring a whole new experience to the film which makes the purchase of the dvd that much better. If you are a fan of documentaries I definitely recommend giving Dark Days a watch. Its unique, interesting, powerful and raw. If you have seen it and enjoyed it get the dvd for sure cause you'll love the extras.",1447718400,,840,4.425806451612903
1636902,5,B00005NSY6,"Wow, just wow. I'm so thankful for everything in my life right now. This documentary has given me so much perspective. I love how even in their circumstances, many of them had it in them to smile, help each other out, quit using drugs, and look forward to going out hustling. Such strong characters, no doubt. It also brings perspective to what people on the street asking for help may be going through on a daily basis, mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. At the end of the day, understanding that that the mind and heart have serious depth that can either swallow us whole, or take us to a whole new world for the better.",1440720000,,639,4.565217391304348

I've watched it about six or seven times since--about five times after finishing that paper--and I love EVERYTHING about it, and have been begging all of my friends to give it a watch as well.",1420502400,,495,4.166666666666667

1636937,5,B00005NSY6,I learned so much from this video.  It's incredible how people try to find and make a home no matter the circumstances they are in.  Making a cozy home in a dark train tunnel  complete with pets in some of the cases just blows my mind.  Survivors.  Every one of them.,1415577600,,267,4.1568627450980395
1636938,5,B00005NSY6,"I probably shouldn't rate this, because I didn't watch it.  After five minutes I had to shut it off.  I can't express how heartbreaking it was to see this human being go into an area filled with trash and slip into a tunnel.  Perhaps I'll be able to watch it someday.  To think that one of God's creatures would be in an emotional place to subject himself to that environment is unthinkable.  God bless the camera person, the main character, and everyone else involved with making this film.",1415491200,,491,4.534090909090909
1636939,4,B00005NSY6,"I think the story of poor folks living in ramshackle housing in train tunnels was informing, eloquent and sad.  I watched about half of it and skipped forward but the latter material seemed to be more examples of the first half of the movie.  I think this is fine overview of poor folks marginalized by a lack of job skills, mental illness, ambition and family support.  Ultimately it's a sad reflection that our society leaves behind many.",1415059200,,440,4.688311688311688

1636943,3,B00005NSY6,I can relate- that kind of poverty is horrible. Been there done that in Fla. And I was working casual tree labor  and had my own  P/u truck. Food stamps too. I paid $75 a month for a flea market shack. 5 months of that crap woke me up. I was on the work list for 4 companies. If two conflicted  one  was a sure FIRE!  I went back in the military. I'd say this movie is  pretty accurate. I  still scrap the streets  for building materials  and unique items while others  hunt  metal. There is $$ on the streets  at the curb. Many still  will survive  on it to pay  bills. Almost everything I saw as a prop in this movie is in fact  available if one is lucky. Even the light fixtures  with bulbs working. I never  looked for food. Never will. Movie might be a wake up call to some out here. All is not over when things  go to HADIES. Life can go on.,1414108800,,847,3.9345238095238093

1636960,5,B00005NSY6,"True, it doesn't show much of the bad side of addicts' personalities. There's a lot of that that can't be ignored either, but this ain't about that.
We need to see junk like this to remind us most people have some (or a lot) of good in them. Most clean up well enough with enough soap, you know?
You get a real clue how much mental illness is involved (in their resistance to moving) by see how refreshed they are to be in an apartment however humble. Watching them sweep dirt and mop mud was bizarre down there. Good thing rats don't pack gats yet too.
Kudos to the film and the advocates that helped them out of the hole.",1412553600,,623,4.2

1636972,5,B00005NSY6,"Never judge a person by the clothes or the items they possess. For even the poor have good amongst them and we should try to live in harmony rather than materialism. Society is a group ogf human beings. Modern society is getting sick, and sicker by the day. We must make efforts to scale back our personal wants and try to work for the best of all things living. I hope those who are out on the streets, alone, made bad choices in their lives, or just plain have had bad luck; i hope they find peace and happiness in their lives, along with comfort. Ive been rich and ive been poor in my life. Ive road the bus for 5 years and seen all types of people and the one thing ive come to realize is we are all one. And by not helping each other out, or providing the facilities to help out everyone we are missing out on a lot of what makes society what it is. I also think if having children was something you had to earn rather than just let everyone have as many as they can needs to start. We need to see that the planet will not sustain the continued pro-creation existence that we are. If we as a society, a group of humans decided to lessen the population overall over many generations through voluntary commitments we could truly turn things around. Or else we are doomed for a long prolonged class war that will take many millions of lives. I digressed a bit there, but i think this movie is a parable to life and what it is to be human and live in a society.",1412294400,,1462,4.133333333333334
1636973,5,B00005NSY6,"Truly epic documentary story telling. I watched this in 2003 when it was new and it stuck with me in a way that few movies can. It both bothered and intrigued me folding me up into a world, a harsh world, that I never fully reconciled.

1636979,1,B00005NSY6,"Basic. Disappointing in that the only parts where there was some interest piqued, no explanation.  For instance, the residents talk about having power.  How?  Where does that come from?  They talked about once having running water as well.  Again.  How?  The only thing really documented here are the inane ramblings of the unfortunate and sad stories. I could have listened to ""Rabbit In Your Headlights"" (U.N.K.L.E.) and ""Midnight in a Perfect World"" (DJ Shadow) whilst bumming a cigarette from homeless person and gotten as much out of that experience as I did from this documentary.

Highlights:  Tommy holding onto his pride like a life-preserver and the black/mulatto ""Slater"" (Dazed and Confused) talking about which cats and gerbils were the bessst MAAAAAAN.

Lowlights:  Learning what dumping out a bucket of s*** looks like (thanks Marc) and the several repeated quick shots of Dee the crackhead tokin' up.  I got it the first time around.  She's a crackhead.  No need to beat a dead horse.",1412121600,,1000,5.0552147239263805

1636988,5,B00005NSY6,"This is about as real as you get.  Honest, biting look at our fellow citizens, the homeless and suffering, being ignored by the mayor of NYC.  Marc Singer spent an important period of his life to give us an insight that would otherwise not be possible.
He is a modern hero, and we all  owe him for this project, bringing some light to darkness.
I am reminded of Louis CK, the extremely talented comedian, and his stand-up in which at one point, he told the story of picking up a lady friend who had come for her first visit to our largest, and most proud city, at a bus terminal (Port Authority) in NYC, and as they came up to the surface street, she spotted an obviously homeless man in bad condition lying on the stairs.
She asked Louis what they could do, how could they help this man, with the most beautiful human sympathy we all should have when we see this.
He responded - ""We don't help those people.  Let's keep going.""
It is part of the genius of Louis CK.  Such a disturbing, visceral, touching situation made into a joke.
We as a society ignore our fellow human beings who suffer so greatly.
I only hope that the kind advocates of the homeless that were in this movie are continuing their noble efforts.
And, finally, I hope that the next billionaire mayor of NYC will not be so callous and cold to the homeless, both as individuals and homeless families.
We are all responsible for this shameful state of affairs.  Perhaps this movie will move you to do something.",1404864000,,1477,4.411764705882353

1637000,5,B00005NSY6,"One of my favorite documentaries. I still think of these characters to this day, and thus bought a copy of it. A surprisingly respectful and unexpectedly humane underworld, in which people at times are more honest and respectful than the 'upper' world--the mainstream. I find these people to be touching, heroic, and unforgettable.",1398643200,,331,5.264150943396227

1637002,5,B00005NSY6,"Here is a little documentary i came across by mistake and took a chance on without knowing a lot about it.
The film is about a community of homeless underground dwellers who take refuge in the dank dark underground of the New York subways and through there ingenuity, and streetwise savvy they survive, and flourish, (to a certain extent) with dignity and grace and humour, and the truest of grit..
The people and the world they inhabit in this documentary reveal a deeply layered, complex  manifestation of the human spirit and the circumstances that lead them to seek refuge in these conditions, and it doesn't always make for easy viewing but its utterly compelling, and deeply  touching, and thoughtful. When this fascinating documentary concludes it left me with  whole new understanding/compassion of the homeless plight, and the people it effects and touches. Highly recommended viewing.",1393718400,,894,5.151724137931034

We know they are in a dark tunnel somewhere, but all we really see is a trash-strewn, graffitied area. It could be anywhere. The use of black and white to showcase the film was not a good idea, it makes the film seem outdated and in the past...without contrast between light and dark, we have no idea what the place is really like.

I watched 30 minutes of this film and didn't want to sit through anymore of the homeless people ranting. Some of their speech is difficult to understand. I started to tune it out. There is no narration in the film.

There are many ways to make a film about the homeless and this one really fell through. I have no idea where the good reviews came from.

It really is a film for those who want to watch homeless people ramble. What I  learned from the film is that alot of the people in the tunnel are addicted to crack, and one of them sells cds and dirty movies on the street to make money.

1637015,5,B00005NSY6,"Dark Days is unique in how it's filmed. To start, it's all done in black and white. At first I wondered why, since it can sometimes make sections of the film more difficult to see. But after watching it twice, I realize that it really helps the viewer focus on the films characters and their stories and how they had created a small village like community, rather than how dirty everything is and unappealing the environment was. This was most apparent when they showed a clip of the bucket the homeless all use as a bathroom. In color this would turn someones stomach, but in black and white you were able to get past the grossness and see how it fits into their ingenuity in creating their homes.

Dark Days focuses on how the homeless who live underground in the city have worked to create new lives and homes in these tunnels. Interviews with them tell about how they collect their items to build them, how they make money, find food and even set up electricity in their shacks. There is some background with the different people, some being homeless from drug use, others for different reasons. You see how they make friends, have pets, talk about their hopes and dreams and are just like any one else.

There  is some swearing and brief moments of drug use for anyone concerned, but nothing too extreme. The worst scene was the bucket public toilet.

The end of the film was a complete surprise to me and I have to say I loved it. It was totally unexpected and really brought it up a level, from good to great.",1327449600,2,1516,4.462093862815885

1637018,5,B00005NSY6,"Marc Singer's documentary ""Dark Days"" (2000) takes us into the lives of a group of homeless people who live in the underground railroad tunnels beneath New York City.  The murky, black-and-white photography captures well the dim and grim world within which these people live; trains hurtle forward into the frame, seemingly out of nowhere, and one gets a strong sense of how precariously the men and women of this subterranean world are living.  As the film progresses, we learn about how each of these people came to be a tunnel dweller, and we see how they scratch out a living in the topside world before returning to their underground homes.  The film takes a startling turn when Amtrak, the owner of the tunnel, announces its intention of evicting the tunnel dwellers, creating a crisis situation for the tunnel community.  The pervasive harsh language, and the film's footage of drug use, may be upsetting to some viewers, but I for one find it more upsetting to reflect that there are people living this way in the wealthiest country in human history.  The soundtrack music by DJ Shadow accompanies perfectly what we see on screen -- the pessimistic quality of much of the film, as well as its surprisingly hopeful conclusion.  A disturbing, powerful film, and one that worked particularly well for me as a companion piece to Jennifer Toth's book ""The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City.""",1305158400,2,1415,4.875

1637042,3,B00005NSY6,"Dark Days (Marc Singer, 2000)

Dark Days would have been a much, much better movie if Marc Singer, the director and star of this film (if it has one), didn't want so very, very badly to be a rap star. Everything about the film, from its graffiti-esque box font to its DJ Shadow soundtrack to Singer's horrendous diction, for which subtitles should have been used a good portion of the time, leads me to this conclusion.

Singer's documentary, anecdotally made with the help of fellow mole people, details thirty days of Singer's life in the abandoned train tunnels that honeycomb subterranean New York (the same subject to be found in Viktor David's vastly superior documentary In Search of the Mole People). For the most part, it's exactly what you'd expect from such a thing, just chronicling the day-to-day life of Singer and his peers, though Amtrak throws in some drama towards the end when they send out a general eviction notice.

This isn't a bad movie, and it's an inherently fascinating subject; as long as you can understand what's being said, you'll find yourself glued to the screen. Just be aware that it's already been done, and much better than this. ***",1246060800,,1170,4.782178217821782

The homeless ""city"" under the streets of New York is truly an eye opener, and after the film is over, I found my sense of empathy and understanding for our fellow human beings, driven to this situation, expanded tenfold. The music of DJ Shadow, an artist who has, in his own right, produced some of the most ground-breaking and beautiful music in recent years, was an excellent choice for the scenes throughout. You'll learn to love the characters - real characters in this movie, as they invite us to take a peek into their world, and you'll learn these people are just like you and me but made some bad choices and fell on some bad luck. What you might take away most of all is that even in the bleakest of situations, there is a light, if only one chooses to seek it out.",1241481600,,903,4.317647058823529

1637045,5,B00005NSY6,Marc Sanger can be applauded for his outstanding heartopening documentary on a group of people living under a tunnel in New York City.  Watching the DVD we get to know each of the characters and see ourselves as one of the same. They bleed and have a beating heart like all of us yet many of us close our eyes when we pass them by on the street corner. After being turned off by the educational system and the contradictions of our present society I left college and traveled across the country.  I found my home on the streets of Berkeley California. Living out of my backpack I slept next to junkies and broke bread with abandon war vets.  I know from my experience that many of those on the street have dreams and wisdom that rises above the average well to do human being.  Marc Sanger gives the viewer the opportunity to become aware of one of the United States Of America most neglected epidemics.  It would profit many in our own country if we left our homes and ate at a soup kitchen.

Early in the film, a homeless man uncovers a passage and lowers himself into an Amtrak tunnel--home to residents of a long-standing shanty town.

The neighborhood is broken up--you decide if it is an act of compassion or an act of cruelty--when Amtrak officials evict the squatters. After the residents are filmed destroying their shacks--you decide if the destruction of these shelters is in celebration or in anger--the film updates the lives of some of the residents. You decide if this lifestyle--scavenging for discarding food, hunting dumpsters for gay porn to sell; improvising alarms to protect themselves-- has been hurtful or helpful to the former residents.

1637048,5,B00005NSY6,"As even the negative reviewers have been picking up on, this film was beautifully captured, and reminded me very much of Jem Cohen's documentary work which is breathtaking (albeit in a very raw form).

Singer (the director) spent about 2.5 year living with and being with people living in the Amtrak tunnel in small 'houses' that they had built, showing the very real community that thrived there.  IMPORTANT: watch the 'making of' documentary that's in the extra features, which in a much clearer way shows just how involved Singer became in these people's lives.  He didn't shoot a documentary about ""those people,"" he shot a documentary about his friends who happened to have lived in a tunnel (some upwards of 25 years).

This is not the flick to watch if you're bored and want something to liven up your life: it won't.  This is very much a mood piece, and you need to be in the right mood (i.e., sort of dark and moody).  This documentary leaves a lot of loose ends.  If you don't like living with that kind of tension, you may not like the film: don't watch it.  If you can handle the tension, and are willing to enter a film that mimicks the world it's portraying, then watch this film: it's a beautiful work.",1195430400,,1217,4.5504587155963305

I put quotes around ""homeless"" because in fact these people had built themselves homes out of scrap material, so they were really homeless people with homes they made themselves.  Also, the music score is totally appropriate and helps too.

However, the bottom line it that it's another ""cut above raw footage edited together"" type of documentary that attempts to let the subjects tell their own story with no narration and no start or ending point, except for the fact I saw the subjects living in clean apartments at the end, which made me feel happy for them.

And, I saw them happy in their new apartments on fast forward because after an hour of watching the subjects blabber on and on and seeing the rats and garbage I'd just about had enough.  The documentary didn't seem to be going anywhere and I think I got the message.

I'm not surprised this documentary is successful and that many like it.  It is rather unique, and it gives us a view into another world.  But for me, it looked like there was no light at the end of the tunnel, so I hit fast forward to get out.",1195171200,2,1313,4.5574468085106385

While it may have been true in 1492 for people to come here and make the most of the vulnerability of the natives, the same is not true today. This is a specific story about a specific group of homeless people who managed to make their way living under the railroad for a long period of time. There appears to be a ""happy ending"" because eventually the government steps in and they get apartments and find jobs - but none of them get rich. And life in America is very, very complicated today. So think about that before buying the bill of goods that America is the ""land of milk and honey.""

This is not an easy video to watch. It is difficult and painful to see how some people in this country have to live just to get by. It is, however, educational, and it will raise your awareness.

This film examines the lives of people who are infinitely more interesting and far more resourceful than Paris Hilton or Oprah Winfrey could ever be.  I must admit to not having the highest opinion of homeless people prior to seeing DARK DAYS, because I often felt like a magnet to which panhandlers were always attracted.  It got to be a bit much at times.  However, I now feel somewhat petty about getting angry with people who out of desperation (sometimes fueled by drug or alcohol problems) approached me for money.  DARK DAYS opened my eyes to the plight of the homeless more than any other film I've seen.  It did such a wonderful job of humanizing its subjects.  When I watched the ""making of"" featurette on the DVD I understood how it accomplished that feat - the filmmaker lived among his homeless subjects in rat infested tunnels for an extended period of time and, in effect, became one of them.  It's very obvious that he earned their respect and trust - something that really comes through in the film.  In fact, I consider Marc Singer, the film's director, to be a remarkable human being.  I sincerely believe he did this great work of art to help his homeless friends get out of the dark, dank tunnels in which so many of them lived for over a decade.  My hat is off to Mr. Singer.

1637065,4,B00005NSY6,"DARK DAYS goes underground to show how the mole people in the tunnels of New York city live.  By showing the homes that they've built and their attempts to yield power over their lives DARK DAYS emphasizes the universal need we all share for a sense of home.

As we shift through the dark space of their world that is at once claustrophobic and cavernous, we see the mundane rituals of ordinary life play out: cooking, raising pets, cleaning, and showering. The men (and one woman) of this film speak of a life lived autonomous from societal intervention. One senses that the filmmaker, and more adamantly the homeless themselves, are trying to convince us that here in the subterranean garbage disposal of life, their needs are being provided for by the trash of the world that is chewed up and spit out. In the film, these leftovers become a metaphor for the people themselves - as they revel in finding a treasure of discarded donuts, or show their opportunist nature by collecting cans for cash to buy heroin. As our waste becomes their livelihood, we start to see them more and more as individuals.  ""We're not homeless,"" one man tells us, ""homeless is when you don't have a home."" But then his friend corrects him. ""Nah, you're still homeless. You just ain't helpless."" But as the film progresses, we start to perceive something in the darkness, something invisible around the edges that keeps them buried underground; it's their addiction to drugs, and the memories of past lives that are fraught with anguish and suffering. They are lost souls - shadow people moving through an ethereal, timeless landscape.

Cinematically it doesn't even matter because the story is enough, but Singer does a great job given the circumstances. He even won the cinematography award at Sundance in 2000.

One thing leads to another, and eventually Marc and his homeless companions become film-maker and crew to ""Dark Days"".

What makes this documentary five stars instead of four is the making of documentary.  Only there do you learn that the movie crew WERE the tunnel folks.

Unfortunately, it was not the financial success its producers hoped for.  But it resonates unbelievably.

This is an excellent film.  It demonstrates that, to a large extent, our existence is based purely on circumstance.  Most of us have been extremely fortunate with the cards we were dealt.

I've gained a new respect for the homeless in watching this, and a new appreciation for all of the many blessings in this life.  Dark Days is a very moving picture of what goes on in the forgotten places in our society.  The people in this film have hit bottom. They now just desparately want to be able to move beyond their mistakes, and make a better start in life.  Not only has the director captured a commonality not normally associated between ourselves and the homeless, but in the end, he actually gives them that new start!  The film can be depressing at times, but in the end, it is very heartwarming!  Don't miss it!",1133395200,3,967,4.418079096045198
1637073,4,B00005NSY6,"...and finding the mundane.

I would suggest to the people that are slamming this movie that this type of flick is not your cup of tea. Go pop a Matt Damon movie in.

This is a great movie on two fronts. First of all, the camera work and editing is perfect, and secondly, it seems to me that Singer's approach to this film is to simply show the viewer that homeless people are not the paper-thin cliche's that our mind conjures up when we hear the word, but three-dimensional human beings that have the same concerns, and live the same life that any of us do.

What is so incredible about this movie is that you expect to see something truly bizarre occurring in those tunnels, and what you actually see is a group of people, doing their thing, just like anyone else. They are a diverse group, which in itself is unexpected. As the film progresses, their plywood huts really begin to seem like any other community, except in a tunnel. It's surreal.

I don't think for a second that Singer wants us to pity these people, honestly a lot of them aren't doing too bad (considering the circumstances). I think the point here is just to observe, and to see that these ""freaks"" are pretty much just standard-issue human beings.",1133308800,13,1220,4.481981981981982

Although I was expecting a more sociological look at the plight of the homeless, I cannot fault this movie for being what it is, because I was really awestruck by it.",1127001600,5,381,4.414285714285715
1637075,5,B00005NSY6,"Imagine for a moment that you're a regular bloke and you want to do something to help the New York City homeless. You've got very little money, no resources, but a big heart. What could you possibly do to make a dent in their population?

If you're Marc Singer, the man behind this Sundance Award winning documentary, you found a way to do quite a lot.

For a person who'd never touched a movie camera before starting in on this ""project"", one can see why this film impacts its viewers on multiple levels. Shot in grainy black-and-white 16mm film, this documentary gives us a startlingly real-life look at several homeless people living in self-built shanties in the Amtrak tunnels under the city. No light makes it down there, except whenever a train skirts by or via the makeshift lighting this weird community has produced by tapping into Amtrak's electrical system.

Marc Singer delves into this society. And I mean he DELVES. Mr. Singer gave up living on the surface and slunk into this netherworld for two years in order to shoot his film. And who did he use as grips, sound assistants, and lighting experts? The homeless themselves.

More interesting than the film itself is how it got made. After watching the documentary, I went ahead and looked over the special features on the DVD and found a ""Making Of"" track which focused on Mr. Singer and how he accomplished his film making. This showed the incredible lack of understanding of anything related to filming and those who helped him out, both in teaching him and by giving him financial help so that the documentary made it out to the public. We also get to see the amazing multiple awards that the documentary won at Sundance; an incredible set of scenes that contrasts starkly with what Mr. Singer had gone through in order to make this film a reality.

Never giving up on his newfound tunnel companions, never letting financial devastation overtake him, never giving up creative control, all added to the success of the film and my enjoyment of all aspects of it. Bravo, Mr. Singer.

(You might be asking what happens to the tunnel-bound homeless. It's a perfect ending to the film, so you'll have to watch it. I ain't giving it away!)",1126310400,26,2201,4.703896103896104
1637076,5,B00005NSY6,"Marc Singer has guts to crawl down a hole into abandonned subway tunnels in Manhattan and attempt to film the homeless in the dark. It is unbelievable what goes on in our own country in this day and age.

At first glance the characters are a little shady (especially Dee when she's smokin' crack like there's no tomorrow!) ...but by the end of the movie you totally love the characters. All of the homeless people have a story behind them - death of a loved one, abuse, etc. If you lost everything, who's to say you wouldn't end up in a tunnel somewhere homeless. I was amazed at how extensive their squats were. Shacks with electricity, TV's, makeshift toilets. It's hilarious to see how some things they do are completely acceptable and others they do are horrific.(In the special features, Ralph admits his cousin skinned and ate a fat cat once to survive.) The soundtrack enhances the experience as well.

All of the characters are memorable. The best part is seeing all of them move into real apartments and get jobs, etc. It is incredible to see the difference that one person can make. According to the movie, at least eight have gotten off the streets directly because of the filming of the movie. Marc Singer is an inspiration. This movie will definitely affect you one way or another.",1122336000,6,1294,4.646288209606987

1637078,5,B00005NSY6,"This documentary won three separate awards in the Sundance Film Festival in 2000.  I can well understand why.  At that time there was a whole colony of homeless people who lived underground in the subway tunnels in New York City.  It was dark and damp and full of rats, but yet they preferred it to a homeless shelter.  There, they erected their personal shacks and struggled for survival, venturing out to forage in garbage cans for food as well as for stuff to sell.  British Producer Marc Singer was so fascinated by these people that he ventured into these tunnels and spent two years getting to know them.  Eventually he wound up living with them and made this film, using the homeless people themselves as crew.

The film is unique in that it shows these homeless people as human beings and the viewer gets to know them as individuals.  Yes, many of them have drug problems, but they still have lives, hopes and dreams, a tough will to survive and often a sense of humor.  They manage to cook meals on makeshift stoves and there is a feeling of camaraderie among them.  We also see their ingenuity with the very little they have.  And realize that their days are full of hard work just to survive.  The conditions they live in are absolutely squalid.  But this is their home.

During the course of the film, Amtrak decided to rid the tunnels of the people and homeless advocates negotiated for them to be placed in real housing.  By the end of the film we see them in real apartments.  There is an upbeat quality to this ending of the film.

However, the DVD is much more than the actual film.  There's a 40-minute interview with the filmmaker, Marc Singer, which is equally as fascinating as the film.  I hadn't realized that he was a non-professional person who had never made a film before.  He spent all his money on a camera and had to learn how to load the film.  He became obsessed with making the film, and became homeless himself after starting to edit the more than 50 hours of film he had shot.  There were many delays and setbacks but eventually the film was made and received many accolades.

On the DVD we also get to find out what happened to the many individual homeless people who we got to know through the film.  A few had died but most of them had moved on and were leading more productive lives.  It felt good to know this and to realize that Marc Jacobs had really done a tremendous good deed by merely making this film.  I applaud him in every way.  And I also applaud the film.  Highly recommended.  Especially on DVD with the added features.",1094860800,59,2572,4.447537473233405
1637089,5,B00005NSY6,"Who's this guy, Mark Singer? Why was he crawling around in the tunnels beneath New York City? Where did he go after making this film?
None of these questions are answered by the DVD's intriguing short film on how ""Dark Days"" was made.
What we do get is a quick picture of a man obsessed by a group of homeless living in an abandoned train tunnel underneath New York. The other reviewers have pointed out how unsentimental, yet full the depiction of these people is. I agree. I'd go further. It's like an angel was dropped out of the sky to make this movie, and then vanished.
Okay, so that's hyperbole.
But that's the kind of whacky thought that occurs to you when you watch the hand-twisting, blushing director describe the movie he made - perhaps the best frickin' movie ever made about homeless people...EVER - the fact that making the flick drove him temporarily into homelessness, the fact that this guy out of NOWHERE wins all the dang Sundance awards a few years back not only for the message, but for the astoundingly beautiful cinematography, yet the kid never made films before... yadda yadda yadda.
This is a landmark film. More hyperbole, perhaps. But the plight of the homeless is one of the biggest problems facing the industrial West. And yet...and yet...zero discussion. Zero concern. Instead, we get a lot of lip about how the homeless are lazy and shiftless and live off the government, etc. ""Dark Days"" shows that the homeless are people. Humans. Complete and beautiful, flawed and ugly. The whole deal. How can you walk away from this movie and see a panhandler without a feeling of, not pity or compassion, but empathy?",1085356800,8,1640,4.7177700348432055
1637090,5,B00005NSY6,"One evening I was flipping through channels on the TV and came across ""Dark Days"" on Sundance Channel.  I have not seen the DVD so I can only comment on the version that ran on Sundance.  It was the most riveting documentary I have ever seen.  Although it has been six months since I caught it on TV, and I haven't been able to catch a rerun since, I have not been able to forget it.  I came to care about the people living in the tunnel, and when the film was over, I felt as if I had just lost touch with some friends.
What struck me about this film is that it was made on such a limited budget by people who lived in the tunnel.  There were no prima-donna actors, directors and producers.  As a result, the film is an honest portrayal of life under the tunnels.
There is excellent information on how the film was made at [web page], and you can also catch some samples of the haunting music from the film.
The film inspired me to learn more about the people living in the tunnels under New York.  Two books I would recommend on the subject are ""The Mole People"" by Jennifer Toth, and ""The Tunnel"" by Margaret Morton.",1035763200,17,1119,4.176744186046512

1637092,5,B00005NSY6,"Marc Singer's self-produced documentary on the tortured lives of homeless people living in the dark and dreary tunnels of an abandoned New York subway is, quite simply, a work of art. It provides an unflinching look at a problem far too many of us choose to ignore, but does so in a way that is neither preachy nor sensationalistic. It also shows that, when it comes to intelligent filmmaking, Hollywood's glossy, sanitized, big-budget style of doings things is not only unnecessary, but in most cases distracting and counterproductive.",1033084800,2,536,5.1022727272727275
1637093,5,B00005NSY6,"This is one of the best films I've seen on homelessness. The individuals in the film speak for themselves and it is their words that reveal the truth of the matter.
The film is interesting in its segmentation into various 'topics' (e.g. rats) and the various levels of how these individuals deal with the living situation is quite moving. There are enough diverse opinions given that one gets a good understanding of the 'glories' of such a life yet it also reveals that it is not always as it appears.
My only critique would be that this is but a small segment of the population and there are many who are less well spoken and who are far worse off in terms of problems (mental health, substance abuse or other) whose lives are considerably worse, whose stories are not seen.
But as a whole this is by far the least judgmental and sensationalized film on the subject I have yet seen.
Definitley get the DVD.  It contains updates of the people in the film and an excellent interview with the director himself.  The way the film came together is almost as fascinating as the stories of the individuals in the film.  More importantly, I believe, you'll see where his heart was in making the film and it really adds insight to the film revealing that it is much more than 'just' a documentary.
There are also clips of footage that didn't make it into the original film. The music is by DJ Shadow whose music is worth checking out also.",1025913600,2,1432,4.5

A couple of months after befriending a bunch of homeless people who had constructed ""homes"" in a train tunnel, Marc Singer got the idea of making a film about them, using the tunnel's residents as the crew, with the aim of using any money the film made to get these people proper housing. He had no idea how to make a movie though, and the 45-minute ""Making of Dark Days"" documentary included on the DVD tells the story of how they managed to pull it off successfully. Singer himself actually ended up living in the tunnels. It sounds depressing as all hell, but the subjects of the film DID end up getting proper housing and rebuilding their lives (updates on what happened to them are also included on the DVD). I would probably give a VHS tape that only included the film itself 3 stars, but the DVD with all the extra material is worth 5 stars.",1025395200,6,953,4.359550561797753
1637095,5,B00005NSY6,"""Dark Days"" is a wonderful documentary and is mandatory viewing for anyone interested in those who make their homes beneath the streets of NYC.  ""Dark Days"" offers up a visual tour of this subterranean landscape.  As someone who lives in NYC, and has been interested in this phenomenon for sometime, ""Dark Days"" is a fascinating work.  Although I must admit that I have a definite attraction to the perverse and mysterious nature of the underground, Singer reminds us that there is much humanity to be found within the sooty vermin-infested underbelly that lies just beyond the subway tracks.
Singer is enamored with the people who live underground and portrays them as complete human beings.  He conducts a sort of Anthropological approach in dealing with them.  He is their friend, he's lived among them and has established their trust, he speaks their language, and he understands their needs and concerns.  The most important element of those who live underground that Singer brings to the forefront are that they are part of a large subculture that thrives on relationships and human compassion.  Yes, a lot of these people are living underground because of choices that they made, many are hiding from addiction, family, the law, and life ON the streets.  Living underground in the vast tunnel network of the NYC subway system, many of these individuals have found their home.  Many of them have even built their homes underground.  There is electricity to be found down there, as well as water.  It is not uncommon for those living underground to have TVs, cooking stoves, makeshift toilets, and multi-room dwellings.  ""Dark Days"" shows all of this, as well as showcasing the relationships cultivated between those living underground.  Through Singer, we become attached to these individuals.  After watching this, I found myself wanting to know where these people are now.
The DVD offers a selection as part of its special features that contains small write-ups of everyone featured in the film and where they were shortly after the film was completed.  If also offers a great glimpse into how the film was made and the immense efforts on both the part of Singer and of those living underground to complete this effort.  The soundtrack by DJ Shadow is great and well worth noting.
Living in NYC, one of the most informative segments of this documentary were those that addressed how the city attempts to deal with this ""problem of homelessness.""  One has to wonder why, if someone is content living underground and simply cannot make it ""upstairs,"" it is such a problem to let them stay.  Offering help is wonderful, forcefully extracting people from their homes is a horrible act of cruelty.  Much along the same lines as forcing someone into a shelter where they will be robbed, raped, and beaten.  The only way to ""help"" those who live underground is to respect them.  ""Dark Days"" is an excellent example of giving this respect and of extending care and friendship to a group of people most of us refuse to acknowledge.  It is because of people like Marc Singer that in the days since Times Square has been sanitized, and while the Bowery is shrinking more and more every day, those who live in NYC without a ""proper"" home will not be overlooked completely.",1010275200,11,3268,4.903636363636363

But that's the troublesome aspect.  It's mostly aesthetics, with a great backup score.
Very little information, almost no social consciousness -- one would think it had been made decades ago.  Singer objectifies the people in front of the lens shamelessly. Or perhaps he is just woefully behind the times and didn't know what he was doing. I would hope that was the case.

I am usually opposed to these types of documentaries.  It is about homeless people living in New York and their hardships.  Most times, this would have repelled me completely.  But I am glad that I didn't know about it, or what it was about, before I went in.  It tells the story of about 5 people and how the city changed their lives.  At one time all of them were house-owning and had jobs.  Some type of situation occured and now they are homeless.  It's a sad story, to see how they live in poverty.  Their personalities are very likeable and many times the film is humorous because of their attitudes.  This  film is about survival and acceptance.  These people have gone through a lot.  The ending is a happier one than I expected.  Also, the soundtrack is fantastic.  I was already a fan of DJ Shadow before I saw this, and so it was good to recognize his works during the movie.  I do recommend the soundtrack as well as this movie.  You're in for some reason life, but the film is very smooth, emotional, easy to follow, and heart touching.

Some lost families due to drugs, others feel that this is the best way to beat the system.  You manage to get yourself involved in each person, and hope for their best as the film goes along.

Their area was surprisingly quiet, given the somewhat proximity to subways, etc. Also depressingly filled with litter, and more than a few rats. A few had dogs (poor dogs), they should have had some cats. Unstated but obvious was the fact that their greatest threat was from other homeless people, though apparently not the ones depicted living in the 'camp.' No statistics provided, but some of the residents believed that most of the inhabitants smoked crack - sucking away what little money they made. No police presence, limited fire department involvement. Residents did have electricity, watched TV on small portables they'd found, didn't have running water. Those depicted probably weren't employable in any occupation - had lost motivation, generally satisfied with their current status.

Clearly a sad commentary on society in general, and some people specifically. Unfortunately, no solutions that I'm aware of. However, when I also read of a former classmate of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts at Harvard (graduated, thought then to be one of the top students), now being homeless because of schizophrenia, it seems very clear that our current approach needs to be radically changed.",1475539200,,1294,5.3431372549019605
