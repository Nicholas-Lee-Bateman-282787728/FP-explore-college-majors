Not my favorite. Where I've watched all my other videos countless times, I've only watched this one twice.",1366588800,,273,4.591836734693878
8539821,3,B009D04CEI,"Snowboard movies are like pizza. There never bad, some are just better then others. We own ""The B"" and absolutely freakin' loved it!!! So we bought this with high hopes. It's good, not great... certainly not as good as the B, but if you love to have shred movies playing on your tv 24/7 like we do then might be worth having in your collection.

I would say that if you haven't seen ""the B"" get that one, instead. If you are new to shred flicks then this one would be a good choice, lots of big mountain pow eye candy.",1359158400,,518,4.128712871287129
