2003505,5,B0001HAGTW,"I Love to watch old movies and I was surprised at how many of these I had never seen before. The movies are of very good quality, especially if your used to watching some of those really old black and white movies. If you're into older mystery and suspense movies these are worth getting.",1128038400,13,288,4.351851851851852

2003507,5,B0001HAGTW,"This is mainly a contents listing of 5 box sets of film-noir collections. Quality is excellent for the Warner box--the films are not public domain and were remastered. The four other collections are of public-domain films, some of which were fixed up somewhat. Film quality is variable (dropouts, scratches, cropped images, fuzziness, low contrast). Most films are quite watchable, and there are some very good versions, especially if low price is considered (e.g., Hitch-hiker--only on CLA9). However, there are some marginal issues (e.g., Red house--only on FN10) and some extremely bad issues (e.g., Man who cheated himself--only on CLA9).

Ratings based on video-audio quality and emphasizing value for money: 5* = CLA1; 4* = CLA9, KIL5, MY10; 3* = FN10

2003508,4,B0001HAGTW,"Fifty good movies for less than a buck each? It's great! I've watched fully half of these films already, and I'm very happy with them. They're mostly around 6 stars out of 10, with some better but few real stinkers. I like the Bulldog Drummond movies (6 of them!) especially, but gems like Suddenly (Frank Sinatra), Algiers (Charles Boyer), and the Kennel Murder Case (William Powell) are here too. See Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff both play Asians named Wong. See Orson Welles, Ray Milland, Edward G Robinson, and the Dead End Kids (AKA Bowery Boys). If you know who Charles Laughton is or just like mystery and suspense from the 30s to the 50s, you'll probably like this collection.

I've watched them ALL now, and I feel just the same. What a great collection! Some are rather flat (I'm lookin' at you, Dick Tracy), but others are real corkers. I liked Too Late for Tears, Kansas City Confidential, and the Man in the Eiffel Tower especially.",1114214400,25,946,4.664670658682635
2003509,2,B0001HAGTW,"To be fair I've only seen a fraction of the movies on this set. I found out about it a day after I bought a ""film noir collection"" and an Edward G. Robinson collection which yielded 5 of the films included here. I netflixed a collection that included three more to see wheather I should chalk up not buying this set as a mistake and try to get what ever I could for the set I had and buy this instead. Now I'm glad I kept the nine dollar difference. ""Impact"" ""Second Woman"" ""Scarlet Street"" and ""They made me a Criminal"" are awful. ""Too Late for Tears"",  ""Kansas City Confidential"", and ""The Stranger"" are OK. ""He walked by Night"" is barely passable. I sort of wish I could see ""Suddenly"" because it sounds interesting, as do ""Quicksand"" and ""Jigsaw"" and I definately admire ""Detour"" if only for its strict adherence to noir conventions and its creative manuvering around the Hayes Office's provision that the bad guy must be punished.",1111104000,7,935,4.5325443786982245
2003510,4,B0001HAGTW,"I have seen only a few of the films in the set, and they have been uniformly excellent. The picture and sound quality have been good so far. Highly recommended!",1096329600,4,160,4.366666666666666
2003511,5,B0001HAGTW,"This set is simply incredible! I read all the favorable reviews before purchasing it but I could not imagine how much fun watching these movies would be. I have been sitting glued to my TV set for three days already (I have watched about 9 DVDs so far). It becomes an obsession. What a fantastic collection, what fun! I am also pleasantly surprised by the overall good quality of the recordings.  Fantastic value and entertainment! At a little over $20 (I bought it second hand but brand new) it's a steal. Cannot go wrong with this wonderful set. Highly recommended for all mystery lovers!",1094947200,29,590,4.673076923076923
2003512,3,B0001HAGTW,"These ""50 Movie Packs"" are a ""Deal"". 50 movies on 12 double sided DVDs for a lot less than $1
each. Some of these same movies are being sold in retail stores for between $5 to $15 each.
As to the movie quality, ""your mileage will vary"". Some are good, most are watchable and there
are a few stinkers {""The Sign Of Four""}.  These are NOT classics, like the ""Maltese Falcon"" is
a classic. They are classics, just because they are old (and marketing by TreeLine).
These are black & white ""B Movies"" from the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s.
TreeLine Films does a good job of transferring them to DVD.  They appear to have found films in
the best condition to do the transfers from.  However it appears TreeLine did NOT do any
post-processing to the DVDs; to clean up past imperfections.  The Historical Purists, will be
glad to know all the scratches in the films, lighting problems and audio aberrations have been
faithfully preserved, intact.  There is only one option, ""Scene Selection"".  The movies are
only broken into four separate scenes.  It barely beats ""Fast Forward"".  But, adding options
and doing post-processing clean up would have added to the overhead of production and resulted
in a lessening of ""The Deal"".
""A Picture"" movie stars are sprinkled throughout all these movies.  Remember, from the 30s to
early 50s, the Movie Studios ruled.  For this period (before TV) outside of the movies, your
evening entertainment options were; going out to a nightclub/bar or staying home to listen to
the radio, read a book or watch the grass grow from your porch.  The studios cranked out a lot
of pictures during this period.  They liked to keep all their stars working and at times any
picture would do.  This was movie making, assembly line style to fill the demand.  In this
""50 Movie Pack"" are some of the results of those times.
I bought this, because of the Basil Rathbone, Sherlock Holmes movies. Basil Rathbone was the best
Holmes, until Jeremy Brett came along to do Holmes. People will buy these DVDs; because they are
deals, because of their nostalgic value, and because they are movie buffs.  {BTW, there is a
lot of real history buried in these films with regards to their context and perspective,
ex., Japan & Great Britain were buddy-buddy, prior to WWII.}
My caveats, I've only viewed 8 of the 50 movies so far.  I suspect it will take me the rest of
the year to view them all.  They are good filler for when there isn't something better to
watch or do.  Not likely, I'll ever get around to the ""Nancy Drew"" movie.  I'm also going to
buy some of the other ""50 Movie Packs"", but for varying reasons.",1088035200,351,2615,4.609071274298056
2003513,5,B0001HAGTW,"I stumbled upon this DVD collection in the local Borders Bookstore and immediatley bought it.  I am an afficionado of old movies, having grown up with many of them and I especially like the old war, mystery and sci-fi films.  So, great was my excitement when I saw this fabulous collection.  I couldn't believe the price and I wondered about the quality of the prints used and the DVD production. However, for the price I decided to take a chance and I have NOT been disappointed!  This is one fabulous set with great films.  The quality is excellent. I do not see how Treeline Films, the manufacturer, can do it.  I realize most, if not all, of the films are in the public domain, but the process of recording 50 movies on 12 DVDs of this quality at this price is unbelievable.  Many of these films have been on other DVDs and sets for much more!
These are not some obscure cheapies with unknown actors.  They range from second features or 'B' films from the old double feature days in theaters, some of which were better than the first feature, to classic 'A' movies, such as ""Suddenly"" with Frank Sinatra, ""Scarlet Street"" with Edward G. Robinson (I watch anything he is in) and ""He Walked By Night"" with Richard Basehart, not to mention Glenn Ford, Mickey Rooney, Brian Donlevy,  William Powell, and, well, the list goes on.
Then there are the great Bulldog Drummond films and the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes features.  Rathbone was always THE Sherlock Holmes to me until the advent of Jeremy Brett but he still holds a place near the top.
My only complaint about this set is it has only one of the Topper films, but, how can I really complain?  Thank you Treeline Films!  Please bring on more of the same!  On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this set a 20!",1083888000,385,1758,4.45625
2003514,5,B0001HAGTW,"Already an owner of the 50 - Horror set, and the 50 - Sci-Fi set, I jumped for joy when I got this collection.  I love those hokey old B&W mysteries. Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, John Barrymore, Basil Rathbone, Brian Donlevy, Bela Lugosi, James Cagney - even Frank Sinatra!
These are gems, some not so nifty, but still fun films, you have long forgotten or never thought you would see again.
A great addition to any B&W mystery fan.  Well worth the price.",1083542400,94,454,4.457831325301205

2003571,1,B0001HAGTW,"This turned out to be an absolutely Worthless Collection ... the Audio on all the movies we have tried is negligible at best... BAD!!!
Anyone who can hear and understand what is being said in the movies has some type of Audio attachment making it so.
They did nothing on these all very OLD films to enhance the audio from decades ago.
They are unwatchable for us and now Amazon does not want to take it back because we did not sit down and watch all 50 at once to ascertain the negative condition the were in.  We purchased the end of September and then went into the Holidays busy busy could not tie ourselves to the TV to watch all 50 of these.  I should not be forced to fight for the return of this item but I will if I have to...

2003585,2,B0001HAGTW,"I love old black & white movies.  I watch them more than I should.  But I just threw this set out.

Almost all of these old movies fall into one or more of the following categories:

-  B or B-- movie grade
-  terrible picture and/or audio quality

True, some of the movies like ""Suddenly,"" ""Eyes in the Night,"" ""The Man on the Eiffel Tower,""  and ""The Stranger"" are wonderful.  (""Scarlet Street"" is also quite good, although it's not one of my favorite Edward G. Robinson vehicles.)

But why bother with this irksome set of DVD's? Do you really have that much time to be aggravated because of the a tiny purchase price?

Why not just type in a few names of good movies and then click on the other movies that YouTube pops up?  You'll get to see a lot of quality old movies, along with better picture and audio quality.",1449187200,,819,4.315789473684211
2003586,5,B0001HAGTW,"I'm a huge fan of classic B&W films. The selection here is immense! So many great, entertaining films. Out of 50 movies, I only disliked 3. Not too shabby!

Each disc is individually packaged in a protective sleeve. None of my discs were scratched, which impresses me because the discs are all double-sided.

I liked this collection so much that I also bought the musicals collection and their ""dark crimes"" collection too. Obviously I highly recommend and will purchase more collections in the future.",1447459200,3,502,4.964285714285714

2003588,4,B0001HAGTW,"This is a very good collection of mysteries with some of filmdom's most celebrated actors and that made it a joy to watch over the course of a three-week period.
I mean, Boris Karloff as a Chinese detective named Mr. Wong? Does it get campier than that?
Or Peter Lorre as a Japanese detective named Mr. Moto? Long before Bruce Lee showed us his martial arts mastery. Moto used his fighting skills to subdue much larger opponents.
And then, of course, there's Basil Rathbone - who set the standard by which all other actors who played Sherlock Holmes are judged: These and many more actors bring their characters to life in this collection that provided me with hours and hours of enjoyment.
My only real criticism of this package rests in the fact that there are a few - not many - movies in this collection that just didn't measure up and could have been left out or replaced with better ones. ""Murder, My Sweet"" starring former song-and-dance man Dick Powell would have fit in perfectly in this collection, for example, but it isn't included.
An excellent collection at a great price.",1441843200,,1086,4.661458333333333

Some of my favorites in this collection include ""Quicksand""(1950/Mickey Rooney), ""Suddenly""(1954/Frank Sinatra), ""He Walked By Night""(1948/Jack Webb), and ""Kansas City Confidential""(1952/John Payne).

I am watching them on a 37"" widescreen tv and the picure on all of the movies still looks good at that size. So far I have been watching episodes of 'Bulldog Drummond' and 'Dick Tracy'.

2003731,3,B0001HAGTW,"As a film noir historian and mystery classics enthusiast, I thought this was an ok collection but just average.

The good:

1.  50 films for an inexpensive price.
2.  A nice array of titles from 1930s-1960s
3.  Liner booklet, list all movies and brief synopsis.

The bad:

1. TERRIBLE packaging.  The dvds come in black unmarked sleeves. Titles are so small on dvds it makes it nearly impossible to find what you want quickly.  They could have at least numbered the sleeves. (Totally cheap and not thought out)
2.  Mediocre sound/visual.  Not the best transfer. However what do you expect when you are getting 50 films for 10 bucks?  You can't expect Criterion quality.

As you can tell from my number ratings, a rather mediocre collection of mysteries. Though I was delighted to watch and have in my collection a couple of nice noir gems, mainly Quicksand with Mickey Rooney and Peter Lorre, and Suddenly with Frank Sinatra.

2003779,5,B0001HAGTW,"I personally enjoy a movie named Topper Returns starring Roland Young.  A bit of background.  Topper Returns starring Roland Young is available on Amazon often times at a price far greater than this 50 title set.  Generally the transfer and sound quality of most of the Topper Returns starring Roland Young DVD's is far beyond horrible.  The sound is awful the picture quality is fuzzy making Topper Returns pretty much unwatchable.

I saw the Topper Returns starring Roland Young on the list of movies offered in this set and figured I'd give it a look to see how bad the print was.  I was shocked clean outta my skin by how awesome and clear the sound was.  I was likewise shocked senseless at the near perfect picture quality of this print.  I would be telling a bare faced lie to say all the offerings on this 50 mystery movie set were best quality.  The audio and or video quality of some movies on this set of 50 are perfectly horrible transfers in every way.

Some of the transfers are not even movies they are old kenticscope transfers of really old first generation made for primitive TV movies.  Old Keneticscope movies were often blurred with terrible sound quality because; the old first generation TV cameras were just straight up awful at rendering a blurr free image with quality sound.  You have to enjoy some of the movies on this disk with the mindset of a historian.  You are watching movies that but for luck and the passion of movie buffs would not have survived.

I also found the Dick Tracy movies a hoot, the ugly stereotypes about people abound. The interesting thing about Dick Tracy is the stereotyping is not all focused on the black racial step-n-fetch-it type characters you would expect in film of this profoundly ignorant racist era. No Dick Tracy stereotypes focused more on class and socioeconomic stereotypes.  Dick Tracy focued on stereotypical criminal sub-types and disgraceful low slob like trashy qualities found among those considered low company.  Dick Tracy focused more on so called good and bad people and its moral judgments were often harsh and overbearing in an ugly if funny way.

However there are some real gems in this set.  Most of the set is a slight film noir type feel.  Some titles included are mysteries only in the fact that one wonders how they got included in this set.  Buying this set is a no brainer for those like me who love a good old fashioned black and white mystery that engages your imagination.  There is far more content in this 50 DVD set of mystery titles to recommend it as a valued addition to your collection than those few unwatchable titles that detract from its worth.  Just remember these movies are often profoundly ignorant statements of the times in which they were made so racial and other stereotypes abound and should be expected.  That said laugh at the fools and enjoy the movies.  If you must rejoice in the fact that most if not all of the racists in these movies are DEAD.

The duration of some of them[about an hour]is great too especially if you have elderly relatives prone to falling asleep at the drop of a popcorn cone. They also make great starting features for double-bill film nights. All are from simpler/more naive movie-making days,although some stand up surprisingly well to our collective cynical/hard-headed modern view.

For my grandparents who rarely ever watch movies, once they started watching them they didn't stop until they watched them all. Now they have borrowed my 50 horror classics.

I watched the musicals first so was not expecting much from the mysteries, therefore I was surprised to find some cult classics and a few halfway decent films with noted actors at the start of their careers or in atypical roles.  Not too bad if you take them for what they were meant to be: class B productions churned out in a few months time.  Don't spend a lot on this, however: most of the films are just a small step above the current tv sitcoms.  And don't bother with the 50 musicals collection unless you just have to see famous singers, mostly black, at the start of their careers.

2003863,4,B0001HAGTW,"I have a few of these collections and this one is my personal favorite. There are a couple of outright duds on here, but even these are good atmosphere to write to or to wind down before getting to sleep. The Dick Tracy films are a favorite, much more strange and gritty than one would think from reading the comic strip or watching the Warren Beatty Dick Tracy movie. Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street is a standout performance for Edward G. Robinson and a must see for any fan of film noir. The same could be said of Orson Welles' The Stranger. The whimsy and disjointed tone of Topper Returns makes it a good, goofy comedy mystery. Too Late for Tears is a deep, dark morass of noir that hits you where it counts. The only serious disappointments for me were the Shadow films. I do not recommend these. The Shadow is a much more dynamic, mystical character who for some reason was dumbed down and rendered downright banal in the movies. To those of you who would gripe about some of these more obscure mysteries being called classics, remember the stranglehold studios have over the copyrights of things like Double Indemnity and The Big Sleep. Of course you're not going to see these films on a collection like this. The point is to discover classics that you might not have had the depth of field to encounter.",1308355200,4,1308,4.523206751054852

2003867,4,B0001HAGTW,"Like another reviewer, I found this a few months ago in an endcap display at Borders.  There were several sets available at the time; ""Drive-In"" ""Sci-Fi"" ""Horror"" and ""Western"" but I picked ""Mystery"" because it seemed like the detective genre is the hardest to mess up.  I've seen atrociously bad movies in all those other categories, but I've never seen a classic mystery movie which I didn't like on some level.  I made the right choice.  Some of these movies are silly, some are stupid, the writing & situations are occasionally painful (the inexplicable casting of Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi as Asian characters for example, or the excruciating no-deduction-required ""It was Moriarty!"" conclusion of all the Sherlock Holmes movies.) But some of these are actually (amazingly) good ... and all of them are at least WATCHABLE.  It took me months to get through the whole collection, and after each movie I congratulated myself on scoring this incredible entertainment deal which amounted to something like 40 cents per movie (plus tax.)

All of these movies are black & white except for one.  ""The Man on the Eiffel Tower"" is in a Technicolor so washed-out it's more of a duochrome orange & navy blue.  It is also one of the worst movies in the entire collection, with an insufferable villain and a pathetic misuse of the great Charles Laughton in a role that required no acting.  Black & white holds up rather well through the various stages of optical & video transfer these movies suffered before being digitized, so picture quality (with a few exceptions) is actually Pretty Good.  Sound quality is uneven; none of the soundtracks could be considered ""clean"" but some were definitely more murky than others.  In a few I noticed that the optical soundtrack's surface noise combined with digital audio artifacts to create the illusion of somebody frying bacon or twisting a giant sheet of bubble wrap somewhere just offscreen...

For entertainment value you just cannot beat this collection.  There's something endearingly wholesome in the naive moral outlook of some of these movies.  The films are arranged by category and in loose chronological order, so if you watch the disks in order you can see a slow progress from the optimism of ""good guys vs bad guys"" detective stories of the 1930s to the depressing grittiness of later Film Noir.  The newest movie in this set is ""Suddenly,"" a tight, tense drama starring Frank Sinatra in an unforgettable role from 1954.  The oldest is 1931's ""Murder at Midnight"" with a meandering plot, bumbling police, and the poorest sound & picture quality in the batch.  Quality ranges all between these extremes.  Nevertheless this set is worth getting if you like old-fashioned crime & detective stories.  Most of these movies you have probably never seen.",1293840000,6,2815,4.976495726495727

2003872,2,B0001HAGTW,"The sound track is nearly completely ruined by an an attempt to improve the sound on every Mill Creek collection that I have bought.

Music: To suppress hiss sounds in the high frequencies the music that accompanies the program has been so lowered in volume that you do NOT feel the musical emotion of the film. This makes every single show unnecessarily boring. It took me a while to realize what was going on. I found that on movies that I have duplicate copies by other DVD makers that the sound is much better and the overall effect is dramatically better even though they have more hiss. Hiss is soothing to some people and it is obviously not worth ruining the sound track to suppress it when you compare.

Dialog: It is hard to tell what the actors are saying. Apparently the sound hiss processing makes the sound suddenly go up and down in volume when an actor talks but the high part of the voice is suppressed to eliminate the hiss. This makes every actors voice sound dull and boring and women do NOT sound as feminine as they normally do (you miss the sexy voice of fem fatals). Suddenly you will hear a little more music when the voice is boosted louder reminding you that you are missing the musical sound track thus you are not feeling the emotion of the program.

Story: Some of these are great old B and B+ movies that are worth watching though they are not the highest budget programs so not the best. Sadly they are ruined by the sound processing. As I have said, I have found a copy of some of the movies on other DVD's and they are dramatically better. Sadly rated a 2.",1273536000,22,1590,4.3830508474576275

Several serialised detectives feature, with multiple entries for the suave Bulldog Drummond, the inscrutable Sherlock Holmes, king of quirk Dick Tracy and the ever-elusive Shadow. A notable single entry is Peter Lorre's delightful Mr Moto character. Genuine film noir classics include Detour (1945), He Walked By Night (1948), the explosive Kansas City Confidential (1952) and two gems starring Edward G Robinson - Scarlet Street (1945) and The Stranger (1946).

The original prints of some of the earlier movies here were in pretty bad shape, but Mill Creek gets the most out of what they had to work with. With the overall quality here being absolutely topnotch, it is hard to complain at this price.",1201564800,2,957,5.012578616352202

2003893,4,B0001HAGTW,"This is probably the best in regards to content of the public domain 50 Movie Packs I have bought so far. You have some of the better mystery serials of the 30's and 40's including Mr. Moto and Sherlock Holmes, as well as some individual entries that are very good including ""He Walked by Night"", which is more of a film noir that is incredibly still in the public domain.

Unfortunately, the video and in particular the audio quality is very uneven in this set. The Bulldog Drummond series, for example, has some of the worst video and audio quality I've encountered in these packs. The films become bright and then dark, then bright again, and then there is an awful hum in several of the films that makes it difficult if not impossible to hear quiet dialogue. This is a big handicap in mystery films where you need to see details of what is going on, as well as hear everything that is being said, in order to keep up with the plot. Imagine trying to keep up with The Thin Man if you couldn't clearly hear what the players were saying!

I'd still recommend this pack, but be prepared to be annoyed at the video and audio quality in some of the older films. As for the individual movies, here's my take:

The first two discs contain 6 Bulldog Drummond movies from the late 30's. The very earliest, ""Bulldog Drummond Escapes"", has just awful audio and video quality. Ray Milland stars in this one, but John Howard stars in the other five. The whole point of this incarnation of the series is that Drummond is always trying to marry his fiance when some crime drama interrupts the proceedings and Drummond has to solve the crime or mystery. The quality of the audio/video is good on all but the earliest two. The quality of the mysteries is excellent.

Next we have three Dick Tracy movies. The best one is ""Tracy Meets Gruesome"" starring Boris Karloff, but all of the films are very good as is the audio and video quality. There is good continuity between the three films too, with Tracy's girlfriend and adopted son providing a home life for the detective.

Next we have two films from ""The Shadow"" series. There's not much continuity here. In the first one, ""The Shadow Strikes"", The Shadow is still acting without the knowledge of the police and outside of the law as he impersonates a fellow attorney in order to solve a crime. In ""International Crime"" The Shadow is known by the police, but now has his own radio show and seems to delight in making them look bad. In the second film The Shadow has picked up a female sidekick that detracts from the plot. Both are above average. Audio/video quality is good.

Next we have three films trying to trade on the success of Warner Oland's Charlie Chan series at Fox. Peter Lorre stars in ""Mr Moto's Last Warning"". Lorre is pretty effective as Moto and did a long series of these films. The two Mr. Wong films are night and day. The Mysterious Mr. Wong has Lugosi in the title role acting almost like a mad scientist. The audio/video quality is poor on this one, and the story is not very interesting either - Lugosi's campy performance is just too much. ""Mr. Wong: Detective"" has Boris Karloff in the title role, this time as good guy. The mystery is interesting and the audio/video quality is quite good.

Next we have eight Sherlock Holmes films. This group is a mixed bag as far as actors in the starring roles and audio/video quality. However, all have interesting stories. Only four have Basil Rathbone as Holmes, and these are the best of the films. The earlier ones have other actors taking a try at the role, and sometimes the result is ineffective. Dr. Watson undergoes the most changes. In ""The Sign of Four"" Watson is a young man who winds up in love with and engaged to the heroine, and in all the others he is played by a much older man even though Holmes is essentially the same age in all of the films. The non-Rathbone Holmes pictures have pretty spotty audio quality, but once Universal takes control of the series the video and audio quality is quite good.

""The Kennel Murder Case"" starring William Powell, ""He Walked by Night"", ""Quicksand"" with Mickey Rooney, and ""They Made Me a Criminal"" with Paul Muni are all well done crime dramas and noirs. Also, the video and audio quality are good on all of these. ""The Death Kiss"" was made in the early 30's but it is one of the best films in the pack, starring the forgotten David Manners as a scriptwriter turned amateur sleuth. Finally there is ""Great Guy"" with James Cagney. This is more of Cagney being his typical wise-guy self on the right side of the law for a change. It is always fun to see him at work, and this film is no exception.

This isn't all of the films, but it gives you a good idea of what is good and bad about the package.",1200268800,16,4759,4.4672036823935555

2003907,5,B0001HAGTW,"Mystery Classics 50 Movie Pack is a collection of 50 mystery movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $21.98 for my set and that comes down to about 40 cents per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

This deal is even better when you consider that many of the movies in this collection are available as individual movie DVD's at prices of $5 and higher. Many of the movies in this collection are presented in better condition than they are from other DVD companies.

This collection includes entries from such popular movie series such as Bulldog Drummond, The Shadow, Dick Tracy & Sherlock Holmes.  The latter is most interesting since they include a trio of movies starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes as well as another flick with Reginald Owen in the role.  Of course there are a quartet of Holmes features with Basil Rathbone in the lead.  Add in such classic mystery flicks as ""Nancy Drew, Reporter,"" ""The Kennel Murder Case,"" ""Kansas City Confidential"" & you have yourself a great mystery collection.

All in all, a great deal for the money.",1194739200,4,1229,4.746478873239437

Also my first acquaintance with Bulldog Drummond, who I liked immensely.  Some new Sherlock Holmes also, although I already have some of the more common Basil Rathbone versions on VHS. The picture is better on the DVD, so even that was worth it.

The sound is a little rough on some of them - well, they're old, you know - but not bad enough to interfere with my enjoyment.  How can you go wrong for less than 35 cents a movie if you're a fan of the black & white mysteries of the 30's & 40's?",1192492800,3,715,4.122302158273381

Oh, the memories!! These are the movies that cling like dreams.

excellent movies.  I guess a lot depends on what you are looking for.

I watched the Drummond entries and I've got that curiosity out of my system (I wasn't missing much but I was very curious). There are some good entries here that I'll be watching soon like The Stranger, Suddenly, Detour, and also some good B entries for those curious to see Bulldog Drummond, Mr. Moto, Sherlock Holmes, and one I was really pleased with, Dick Tracy!

There were SO many movies that I had never seen before so this isn't just your rehash of TNT or AMC showings. Some of my favorites were: The Shadow (2 movies); Dick Tracey (3 movies) and Mr. Moto.

The fact that these are SO inexpensive just makes them that much better!  Definitely a set worth buying if you enjoy these old films as I do!

Likewise, if you wish to ""research"" detective costumes of the 1940's - this would be a great set.  The costume should be something along the lines of classic Bogart in ""The Big Sleep"" (not included in this set) because you would want to present almost the ""stereotype"" of a 1940's detective rather than piece for piece historic props.",1142899200,36,935,4.470588235294118
