8076021,3,B000A7Y1B2,"Before I watched this video on Augustine, I had watched another Prime video entitled Augustine:  A Voice for All Generations.  From a historical perspective I preferred A Voice for All Generations.  It was longer (57 mins) and more informative while still inspiring.  This Pioneers of the Spirit video was more focused on the spiritual journey and insights gleaned from Augustine's Confessions.  I appreciated the analysis and insights of the presenters, but I was really looking for the content of the first video.  Additionally, I was able to watch the first video free using my Prime account, but I had to rent the second for a small fee (also on my Prime account).",1421280000,,668,4.919642857142857
8076022,1,B000A7Y1B2,Holy Moly! What a waste! This is a 25 minute production that has a handful of non-experts making generic statements about St. Augustine. Not well sourced or cited the only redeeming feature being the quotes used.,1370822400,2,212,4.916666666666667
