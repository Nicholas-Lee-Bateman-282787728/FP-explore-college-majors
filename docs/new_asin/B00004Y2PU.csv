1369554,1,B00004Y2PU,"This movie was far more about young teen romance than soccer.  A matter of fact there is very little soccer in this movie.  It is disgusting that Hollywood promotes romance on innocent children, and even encourages it with this type of trash they put out for kids.  There is a party scene as well, with vivacious young ladies and dancing, while others are holding drinks (suggesting a more grown up type alcohol atmosphere).  Guard your kids. Protect your kids for all the evils of this culture.

""If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."" Jesus, Matthew 18:6",1284595200,3,704,4.46875
1369555,3,B00004Y2PU,"With the original ""Air Bud"" film doing well in the box office (the $3 million film made $24 million), ""Air Bud"" has produced a total of five films from 1997-2003 with each film focusing on a different sport that Josh Framm and his talented dog Dub would participate in.

The current ""Air Bud"" films now exist with his five children known as ""The Buddies"" in which a total of four films have been made since 2006.

With the popularity of ""The Buddies"" video releases and the current 2010 FIFA World Cup now just starting, the third ""Air Bud"" film titled ""Air Bud: World Pup"" features Josh and Budd now taking on soccer and also is the first appearance of ""The Buddies"".

Thee years after ""Air Bud"" has surprised people in the town with his ability to play basketball and football, Josh Framm is now a 15-year-old, his mother Jackie (played by Chilton Crane) has married the local vet Patrick (played by Dale Midkiff) and his younger sister Andrea (played by Caitlin Wachs) is growing older and now playing soccer.

But if there is one major difference with Josh this year, it's the fact that he is 15-years-old and he finds himself attracted to girls.  But one girl captures his attention and it happens to his sister's soccer coach and new, fellow high school student Emma Putter who just moved to the US along with her father from England.

And it's not just Josh who is smitten...  Even his dog Bud has found a female golden retriever that he has fallen for.

Immediately smitten by Emma, Josh finds out that his best friend Tom also likes Emma and somehow, both end up watching Emma join the boy's soccer team.  With the soccer team in need of three more players, Tom and Josh ended up joining the team and the third, who best than Josh's talented dog, Bud.

But the Timberwolves soccer team is not exactly the best and Coach Montoya (played by Miguel Sandoval) knows he has his work cut out for him and that this team needs some major practice.

Meanwhile, two thieves have their eyes sent on stealing a golden retriever owned by a wealthy owner and each night, while riding in a ""Dog Catcher"" vehicle, the two wait for their opportunity to steal the female retriever.

But every night, Bud has left his home and has found a way to get closer to this female retriever.  Suspicious of Bud's nightly gallivanting, young Andrea and her friend have a plan, to follow Bud and find out what he is doing each night.

It is revealed that the female golden retriever that Bud has fallen for is owned by Emma, the girl that Josh is head over heels for.

Will Josh ever find a way to get Emma to notice him?  And what about Budd and his new female friend?

""Air Bud: World Pup Special Edition"" features Josh and Bud as they learn how to play soccer and also features members of the 1999US Olympics Women's Soccer team.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Air Bud: World Pup - Special Edition"" is featured in widescreen (1:85:1) - enhanced for 169 televisions. For a 2000 film, the picture quality is good and doesn't looked aged in anyway.  Since the film is shot outdoors for most of the film, there is a good amount of detail and lighting during those scenes.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound with a Spanish language track. For the most part, ""Air Bud: World Pup - Special Edition"" is a center and front channel driven film. Dialogue is clear and understandable as well as the film's music soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Air Bud: World Pup - Special Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  * All-New: The Buddies Sports Channel: Soccer Edition - (5:15) Join Rosebud in the broadcasting booth as she and the rest of the Buddies, B-Dawg, Mudbud, Buddha and Budderball, review the instant replay on the amazing soccer career of their dad, Air Bud.

EXTRAS:

""Air Bud: World Pup - Special Edition"" comes with a cardboard case and also comes with Exclusive In-Pack ""Air Bud"" Sport Cinch Bag - a cool collectible sports bag, branded with the AIR BUD logo, to carry the fun from the family room to the playing field.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With the popularity of the buddies films and the 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP now happening, it's great to see a special edition ""Air Bud: World Pup"" come out. Where the first film focuses on a child who lost his father and bonds with his new dog, this second film focuses on Josh getting used to his mother dating a new man.  This time around, it's about Josh having an interest in a girl and Bud mixing it up with a female lab.  Less focus on the parents and moreso on Josh and his younger sister Andrea.

If you watched the previous ""Air Bud"" films, you know what to expect from ""Air Bud: Wolrd Pup"" but this time the sport is soccer.  If anything, one of the problems that the film has faced is the inconsistency of the talent playing the mother, the step-father, the sister.  But fortunately, the main character Kevin Zegers (for those of you are familiar with his latest role as Damian Daalgard on the CW's ""Gossip Girl"") still plays the character of Josh Fram and that his buddy Tom (played by Shayn Solberg) also is back.

Because the character of Josh Framm was growing older, the writers would need a way to keep the film fresh for the younger viewers and for ""Air Bud: World Pup"", the writers chose to utilize Josh's younger sister Andrea much more.  In this film, there is a focus on Andrea's friendship with Tammy as the two spy on what Bud is doing during the night and by the introduction of Andrea, this easily sets up her character for the next two ""Air Bud"" films.

""AIR BUD"" is a fun film for the whole family. Parents do not have to worry about their children being scared. The bad guys are just a bunch of goof balls and unlike the two previous films, these thieves are nothing like ""Home Alone"", nor do they seem threatening.

Although, some parents may have a problem when they see Andrea Framm and her friend leaving home during the night to follow Bud's whereabouts and of course, parents may want to explain to their children that it's something they shouldn't do. Also, parents may want to teach their kids to call ""911' and that children should never chase after thieves. Granted, it works for the storyline but of course, these are two scenes in which parents may have a problem with.

The DVD comes with the buddies special feature which is nothing much but just an added feature for your children who love the buddies. There is also a production featurette with interviews with the cast and crew and also, for those who watch and think ""yeah, right... no way a dog can play soccer"" (which is what I was thinking while watching the film), this featurette shows Bud the Dog actually playing soccer, hitting the balls off his head and so forth.  So, that surprised me.  And also, you get this nifty blue and yellow Air Bud sports cinch bag that comes with the special edition DVD release.

But the film is safe for children and of course, there are unrealistic moments that parents may roll their eyes to but for the most part, this film is for the children, and as I watched this along with my seven-year-old, he enjoyed the film a lot.

Overall, ""Air Bud: World Pup - Special Edition"" is another fun, family film.  If your child/children has enjoyed the last ""Air Bud"" films, enjoys any of the ""Buddies"" films or has an interest in soccer, it's definitely worth picking up ""Air Bud: World Pup - Special Edition"".",1276560000,,7776,4.568443804034582

1369564,4,B00004Y2PU,"Air Bud 3 is Orwellian brilliance: in the style of the George Orwell classic Animal Farm, human actors are put into an animal form to create an allegory that within this film is nothing if not overtly transparent.

Air Bud 3, starring a talented dog actor, is a nuanced look at Euro-American relations, especially important in the politics of the Bush administration. The blonde-haired (and thus a caucasion surrogate) golden lab dominated basketball in the first two installments. This is highly symbolic: like white america has appropriated black art forms, we find a blonde-haired animal infiltrating and deflecting attention towards itself (think of Eminem and the adoption in suburban white America of black fashion). If those were not wildly subversive films, nothing is.

Here, Bud dominates soccer, Europe's game. The symbolism is obvious: the United States has taken possession of Europe and European policy. Orwell would be delighted! Playfully employing language nuances to instruct and astonish the viewer, this is an intensely imagined narrative and call to arms standing among Air Bud's best works.",1100649600,4,1112,5.385057471264368
1369565,3,B00004Y2PU,"Josh develops a crush on the new girl in town, who happens to be an expert soccer player. She attends his high school, and is part of the first soccer team at that high school. The soccer team ends up being two players short. So, of course, Josh joins up. That makes them one player short. Guess who signs up next?
As far as wholesome, simplistic, light as cotton candy family entertainment goes, this is top notch. My only real complaint is that dog catchers were involved in the film, and hasn't someone in Hollywood realized yet that the evil dog catcher is a thing of the past? It's completely unnecessary in today's scripts.
Anyway, Buddy himself falls in love, with none other than the dog that belongs to Josh's new love interest. They have puppies, and for some inexplicable reason the dog catchers want to steal the puppies. Well, that's OK, because the puppies are adorable (even if they're of different sizes throughout the film - larger when they should be smaller, smaller when they should be larger). We see them as puppies just out of the womb, and is there much in life cuter than a newborn puppy?",1089763200,,1113,4.57
1369566,3,B00004Y2PU,"The original Air Bud dealt with a lot of serious issues.  Josh had lost his dad, he moved to a new town and had no friends, he had to confront Buddy's original owner, and he had to chose losing Buddy to protect Buddy.  World Pup is so devoid of serious moments that one wonders at some of the characters.
Both Buddy and Josh find love interests in this movie.  Things start with Josh's mother remarrying.  Josh joins the soccer team in order to be closer to, and possibly make points with, a girl he is attracted to.
Two shady characters are out to get Buddy and Buddy's love interest (and later, their puppies of which there are six and not four like pictured on the cover).
There are plenty of good dog moments and the lack of seriousness means parents will not be tempted to skip over any scenes.  But there are two things that don't make sense.
Who are the bad guys, what are they really up to, and how can they make any money at it if it takes them many months just to get at Buddy and family?
As in Seventh Inning Stretch, Josh's parents go to the big game and find out Josh is missing (as is his girlfriend and Buddy).  What do they do?  They watch the game!  Can you believe it!  They show no concern for a missing child (at least in SIS they have a few lines about wondering where they could be).  The way the mother was portrayed in the first movie, she should have been turning the town upside-down looking for Josh.  Not a good portrayal of a loving family.
But, all in all, the movie is fun and appropriate for younger children (my four-year-old loved it).",1075075200,3,1569,4.266891891891892
