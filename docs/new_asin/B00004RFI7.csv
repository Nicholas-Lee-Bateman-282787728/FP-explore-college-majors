1343831,5,B00004RFI7,"Take ""have gun, will travel.""  Make him travel around in a world of intersteller travel in a recessive galactic economy.  Have him go after high stakes bountys.  Now, have him fail to succeed in accomplishing his  goals, while simultaneously having a positive synergistic effect on the  dynamic, three dimensional characters he meets throughout the universe.  And don't forget the bitchin' jazz, neat technology, realistic (as these  things go) vision of the future, and the delightful animation from Sunshine  (they did Escaflowne, Gundam, Outlaw Star, &tc).  Watch: this is the  anime that non-Otaku (it means ""dork) can watch!",954460800,4,629,5.391752577319588
1343832,5,B00004RFI7,"Cowboy Bebop is cool. Very very cool. I could leave it there, but could also go on to say that it has some of the best music ever in anime, and the occasional mind blowingly good visual. This DVD contains what have to be  two of my favourite episodes, Fallen Angel's Ballad (definitely inspired by  The Crow) and Sympathy For the Devil (which is exceptionally bluesy.) Some  people call this Lupin for the 90s (and I suppose 00s) but I'd say it's a  lot better then that.  For anyone who doesn't know the plot its basically  revolves around Spike, a bounty hunter, and Jet, his partner, with extra  characters being added as the show progresses. Although the stories do  often follow the exact same formula (ie - I'm going to go get a bounty on  this guy) there's enough neat plot twists and variations to keep you more  than interested. The setting is sci-fi-ish - the main settings being  colonies on Mars and the asteroid belts - but this isn't something that  thrust into your face. The futuristic backdrop is just that, a backdrop and  (or so I think) just an excuse for some cool ships.  Anyway, that's enough  from me. Buy it. Now. Or regret it.",953942400,5,1152,4.497584541062802
1343833,5,B00004RFI7,"This is perhaps one of my favorite Asian exports. The second session has such strong episodes, outlining things to come and bringing depth to some of the side characters. I think that the best part of a story is giving you things to relate to and these storys are full of that.

With plot twists, foreshadowing, and a new character, you can't go wrong. Pick up the fist session and continue with this one. You won't be sorry you did.",1142380800,,433,4.4125
1343834,5,B00004RFI7,"Cowboy Bebop has a reputation as one of the best animes out there. Thankfully for everyone, it lives up to that reputation. In Session 2 more of the permanent cast is added and there's plenty of action.

In Sympathy for the Devil, Spike has a run in with a creepy kid who seems to have some serious things wrong with him. This episode is a mystery and what would be considered a typical episode of Bebop at its finest.

Heavy Metal Queen is a sweet and adventurous piece with Spike and Faye trying to capture a bounty all while Spike has a hangover. There are some funny moments in this one and some memorable minor characters.

Waltz For Venus is a beautiful story of family and the sacrifices a person will make for that. It also has a thing or two to say about what we consider ""bad"" and ""good"" and the reasoning behind both.

Jamming With Edward adds the irrepressible Ed to the crew of the Bebop. While trying to find out why a satellite has gone rogue, the galaxy's greatest computer hacker has a run in with Spike and crew.

Ganymede Elegy is a Jet centric episode where he deals with a woman from his past. It ties up some loose ends with Jet and gives him a background.

Cowboy Bebop is at heart about dealing with one's past and the mistakes that have been made. That theme resonates soundly through all these episodes.",1097798400,2,1329,4.382113821138211
1343835,5,B00004RFI7,"The second session of the CB series has many merits, and only one slight stinker of an episode.  I'm fair and honest in my reviews, meaning that if something sucks, I'll say so (and have quite a few times).
6: Sympathy for the Devil: The best non-Spike oriented episode of Bebop, great plot and reflections of human nature.
7: Heavy Metal Queen: Yoko Kanno shows exactly how much talent she has with this episode, making a perfect parady of an 80's heavy metal tune (very cool).  Otherwise, a normal (of course good) episode.
8: Waltz for Venus: I don't really know what to say about this episode.  It's awesome, but I can't really say why.  Take a look and you tell me.
9: Jamming with Edward: Ed-isode, where the little girl hacker is introed.  Since I hate Ed (but realize that she's sometimes needed for comic relief), I'm not a real good judge of this episode.
10: Ganymede Elegy: Jet-isode, the first of few, where the crew goes to Ganymede to turn in a bounty, and Jet must deal with his past (has and interesting foreshadowing of when Spike must deal with his past, at the end of the series)
The extras on this DVD are good, because you get to see the creator's and Yoko Kanno's (songwriter/composer) interviews.  It's a little wierd, though.  In Japan, they like to have just the interviewee's face filling the entire screen (my friend and I were once making fun like one of said interviewees would get the up-the-nose cam).",1066608000,6,1433,4.57421875
1343836,5,B00004RFI7,"This seconds CD presents more of what made the first collection a hit.  Fast-paced plots full of space battles, fights, and dirty dealing.  Faye has moved into the Bebop and with three people and a Corgi to feed, the can du jour is usually dog food.  With Faye's exotic tastes the crew again get deep in situations that a sane bounty hunter would never touch.  Ninety-year-old pre-adolescents who play a mean harp, mysterious lady truck drivers, and hackers from hell set the pace.  As usual, the Bebop may get the guy, but more often than not, they don't get the reward.
Jet Black, in an introduction to episode #8 describes this story of a bad guy who almost makes it back to good as a 'change of pace.'  The truth is that one can say the same thing for all the episodes.  The overall themes are still light, although several times stronger, more emotional contexts come into play.  The apparent villains are often not the real villains, and the little character insights probe deeper than before.  Especially in Jet Black's case.
Episode #9 introduces Radical Edward - 'Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky the fourth' who is a change of pace all by herself.  Ed is a 13-year-old super hacker who decides that the Bebop is her key to exciting adventure.  When Spike, Jet, and Faye come into Earth on what they think is a vacation, the get hooked into tracking down the hacker who used a battery of space lasers to indulge in a bit of terrestrial finger-painting.  This gets them all tangles up with Ed, and, to quote the crazy woman with the remote control, 'Ooh La La!!'
In an on-disk interview, Director Shonichiro Watanabe states that the overall theme of the series will be Spike's past or karma.  Other than the final episode of the previous session, we have seen very little about his history.  Typically macho, neither Spike nor Jet display much emotion or talk about themselves, and all Faye seems to talk about is what she wants.  This will begin to change in later episodes, but for now the watcher can relax and enjoy the hopped up, jazzy scripts.",1043625600,6,2056,4.62534435261708
1343837,5,B00004RFI7,"With Session 1 of ""Cowboy Bebop"", we were introduced to three of the main characters and managed to catch a glimpse of Spike's past. The end result was a satisfying beginning to a wonderful anime series. With Session 2, the series presses on with its noir-style flair that sets it apart from everything else. While episodes 6-10 aren't as enigmatic as the first five, they still have their appeal and make a wonderful addition to the series.
Like the first five episodes, the next five episodes follow an episodic format, meaning the storylines don't overlap and they can each be viewed separately. While Session 1 introduced us to the characters of Spike, Jet, and Faye, Session 2 mainly follows their adventures as they try to catch their bounties (more often unsuccessfully than not). Of course, Session 2 does take the time to introduce us to the fourth (fifth if you count the data-dog Ein) and final member of the Bebop, the Earth hacker Ed. As before, these next five episodes contain doses of action, humor, and pizzazz that only ""Cowboy Bebop"" can create. The pacing is just right, and every movement fits perfectly. We never lose interest in the characters, and the stories are rarely boring if ever. It's amazing that the show's creators could maintain the show's trademark finesse with each and every episode, making them all unforgettable.
Just as good as the episodes is the stellar animation. Using a blend of CGI and traditional animation, ""Cowboy Bebop"" manages to become a standout in today's market of anime. Everything looks clean and polished, from the beautiful environments to the character models. Speaking of the characters, they also manage to stand out in the anime community thanks to their realistic yet wacky builds. And the CGI blends in so well with the hand drawn animation that's difficult to tell where the two come together.
Complimenting the great animation is the wonderful music. Yoko Kanno of ""Vision of Escaflowne"" and ""Macross Plus"" works her magic yet again in ""Cowboy Bebop"", creating some of the most eclectic and memorable music ever head in anime. The music is so varied that it's almost impossible to guess what she'll use for the next episode. While the music in Session 2 doesn't have any defining moments like Episode 5, ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"", it's still powerful enough to be considered a highlight of the series. And as for the dub...if you don't like the English track, there is something wrong with you. Bandai, knowing full well how good this series is, took the time to put together one of the most memorable dubbing casts ever assembled, creating a near-perfect dub that many (myself included) consider far better than the original Japanese track.
All in all, ""Cowboy Bebop"" Session 2 continues the tradition set by Session 1 and does it in the same no-holds-bar style. Without a doubt, ""Cowboy Bebop"" is one of the slickest anime series to have ever been made, and it's so good that it is a crime to limit it to the anime-loving community. If you haven't been exposed to ""Cowboy Bebop"", you need to discover what you've been missing.",1027296000,11,3096,4.865530303030303
1343838,5,B00004RFI7,"This DVD is just as awesome as the first one.  With 5 episodes and new extras, this DVD is definitely worth getting.  There are 2 new trailers, an interview with the creator of Cowboy Bebop and an interview with the Sunrise staff.  In the 5 episodes, the Bebop crew are now getting bounty rewards and get into some interesting situations.  Ed, the hacker joins the Bebop crew, which adds some humor to the series.  I can't wait to see more Cowboy Bebop!",1019088000,,453,4.475609756097561
1343839,5,B00004RFI7,"Cowboy Bebop is the most amazing anime series I've seen to date.  Both complex and self-contained, each 20 minute episode is a trip through space on its own.  Together with the other episodes, there is much to learn about this world, the main characters themselves, and of jazz.
Pick it up today - you don't have to be a hardcore anime fan to love this series!",1009843200,,360,4.4393939393939394
1343840,5,B00004RFI7,"as I stated in the 1st session dvd review I'm knew to cowboy beebop and think this is my favoirte Anime (DBZ would probaly be my favoirte but Cowboy Beebop sure has more charm, story and better music to it.  But DBZ is just my favoirte)
To compare Session 1 to 2 isn't something I wanna do.  I don't want to say niether is better.
But I guess I hold Session 2 closer because for one.  episdoe 1 and 2 are good in the first one but the show really didn't completly open up till I believe about 3.
and REALLY REALLY opened up in 5.
5 has been pretty much my favoirte episdoe cause I can't stop watching it.
Session 2 however is great all over! EVERY episode in part 2 is a complete masterpiece (5 is the master piece of the first one)
But I love Edward, and finally she makes her introduction which she is the coolest.
Get this after getting Sessions 1",1006473600,,850,4.108433734939759
1343841,5,B00004RFI7,"I'll talk a few things about the universe of Cowboy Bebop. Most of the technology is the same one that in our time (like guns, cars, airplanes) but there are also some new important stuff. The Space Gates made possible the conquer of the space because they can transport the solar rays through the space allowing the formation of atmospheres and the growth of vegetation in distant planets.
The universe of Cowboy Bebop is of a futurist ""old west"" but you can't detach it from our time. The characters are not the prototype of heroes, they are not even famous and they always have to fight to survive (always lack money). The referents of this story are greats animes : Lupin III and Cobra
(spoiler)
The music of this second DVD is equal or even most wonderful that the first one. Yoko Kanno Demostrates her versatility creating diverse types of musical goods. You can hear a Heavy Metal (in Heavy Metal Queen),  jazz ( the harmonica solo in Sympathy for the Devil), rock (jamming with Edward). Her music is the most complete that I ever hear.",1005696000,,1043,4.60752688172043
1343842,5,B00004RFI7,"These five episodes are some of my favorite in the story. The first episode on the disc, Sympathy for the Devil, was very dark and bizzare. It's almost like something out fo Blue Seed or the X-Files. I've been hearing a lot of people say that they disliked ""Heavy Metal Queen"" so I had to see it. To my surprise, it wasn't as bad as people say it was. Maybe it was the fact they only watched the dubbed version which portrays VT as a girl instead of a guy. It's not a bad episode, but rather a solid one to say the least. ""Waltz For Venus"" was just perfect! It starts out with Faye and Spike stopping a hostage situation on a ship and it only gets better from there. The episode ends in tragey much like the first episode of the series, but still remains as good as that episode in contrast. ""Jammin With Edward"" will definetly be a favorite with many who enjoy acting like a child. That's right, the comic relief character has arrived and it makes a grand enterance. Ed has the power to hack into any network and can even manipulate ships! One of the best moments in that episode is when Spike and Faye make their way through the sattelites firing laser at both of them. ""Ganymede Elegy"" was another great episode. After catching another bounty, the Bebop is on it's way to Ganymede where Jet visits his old girlfriend. And her new boyfriend has a bounty on him. Once again, this plot follows a similar story to episode 1. It ends pretty well too. One of the best parts on this disc is the first half of the interviews shown on Cowboy Bebop Session 0! They were very entertaining to say the least. These 5 episodes are what I like to consider the Golden years of Cowboy Bebop. They catch many bounties in these episodes rather than lose them in other episodes to come. Overall, great disc. A must have for the episodes and the extras.",992131200,,1835,4.337209302325581
1343843,5,B00004RFI7,"Cowboy Bebop is, in this reviewer's opinion, the finest series that anime currently has to offer. The animation is top-notch, the writing is consistently excellent, the English voice work is amazingly good, and the soundtrack (provided by Yoko Kanno) is absolutely brilliant throughout the entire series. It's a pity that the series had such a short run-- what's available in these six DVD volumes constitutes the entire twenty-six episode series. Nevertheless, this is one series every anime fan must have, and a series I would also recommend to fans of TV shows such as Miami Vice.
  Cowboy Bebop's basic structure allows each episode to be a full-fledged story all its own, with the main characters-- Spike, Jett, Faye, and Edward-- serving to connect them all. While there is a consistency to the entire series outside of the characters-- mainly concerning each character's exploration of his/her identity-- this is a more episodic anime series than something such as Evangelion, and yet far less formulaic than Dragon Ball Z and its brethren. I cannot stress how incredibly good the writing is here-- each episode is a self-contained story full of integrity: sometimes dramatic, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but always effective each time without sacrificing any of the show's core values.
  Each DVD disc in this series is a bargain-- five episodes per disc for Volumes One and Two, and four episodes per disc thereafter. Extras are limited, but the video quality is outstanding, and both Japanese/English tracks are provided, with English subtitles. The English voice acting is very impressive--  dialogue is still intelligent following the translation, lip synching is dead-on, and the voice actors are almost as endearing as the characters they portray.
  In Volume Two, we meet the final member of the Bebop's crew and learn more about Jett's past. There are some humorous moments here as well as some poignant stories reminiscent of the first episode from Volume One. If you enjoyed the first volume, don't hesitate to pick this up; the series is only getting better from here.",990403200,,2091,5.150442477876106
1343844,5,B00004RFI7,"The brilliant series continues! Althought later sessions (cough, session four, cough cough) are not as creative session 2 will not dissapoint. The higlights of this session include the introduction of the whimsical hacker Edward, (the final member of the Bebop) an interesting fairy tale episode (in Bebop style mind you) and the sad yet beatiful ""Ganymede Elegy"" which is a must see. As before the animation is topnotch, the jazz frantic, the stories are wonderous, and the acting oh so good.....",990230400,,497,5.148148148148148
1343845,4,B00004RFI7,"Ultimately, Cowboy Bebop is the pinnacle of Anime as I know it.  This DVD expands upon the crews relationships past and present, more specifically Jet's.  There is not a definitive episode on this DVD that touches me the way Ballad of Fallen Angels did on the first Session, but lightning doesn't strike twice in a row.  They save more thunder for the Session 3: Jupiter Jazz episodes.  Needless, this is a must own as Jet's past is defined as well as the addition of Ed.  Buy it.",987984000,,480,4.471264367816092

Spike and Vicious conclude their reunion with  a deadly duel. And after that,  more mayhem and hilarity await as the crew  of the Bebop continues to try  and make a living as bounty hunters. As  they travel, they will meet up with  a feisty space trucker, make a stop  on Venus, and meet up with the great  hacker Ed.",966643200,,543,4.494845360824742
1343851,5,B00004RFI7,"In the first volume they didn't get a single bounty, but cheer up, they catch a couple bounties in this volume.  The first episode of the volume, ""Sympathy for the Devil"" is a little strange but still exciting,  along with bringing another small flash into spikes past.  The second  episode i didn't see as too significant, but i could be proven wrong when i  see the third volume. The third episode is where they catch actually a few  bounties, a couple at the begining and at the end of the episode. This  episode is also kind of moving as we see a softer side to Spike, showing  the sensitivity burried deep down.  The fourth episode is when we meet  Ed... advice to all, if possible watch all episodes with Ed present in  japanese, Ed has the most annoying dubbed voice, and the sad part is Ed is  a girl, and will be in many future episodes, but i won't ruin that for  you... The fifth episode is were we go into Jet's past a little as we meet  his old girlfriend, who's boyfriend happens to be Jet's bounty.  Over all  i think that this volume is very good, some episodes better than others,  but it is still great. We get to see a little more into the personalities  and backgrounds of the characters and ponder over all that symbolism.  Cowboy Bebop is as good as ever in this volume and I have very high  expectations for the third volume.",961804800,2,1348,4.337349397590361

7921347,5,B00004RFI7,"In 2071, man has colonized many of the planets in our solar system. People from all walks of life roam free. Violence, freedom, love, hate, and every other aspect of human nature is rampant across the galaxy. Those that capture wanted criminals are called cowboys(bounty hunters). Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and their dog, Ein are the top bounty hunters in the solar system. They all have different pasts, different reasons for being partners, and different fates awaiting them. As their pasts come back to haunt them, can they survive and keep their friendship strong, while at the same time making a living catching bad guys?

Cowboy Bebop is an anime legend. It's probably one of the best ever. I don't know if it makes my top 10 list or anything, but it's darn close, and a must see for any anime fan, or fan of super cool action shows. This series has great animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot. The story has a very methodical nature. Most of the episodes are about them chasing different bad guys. There are a few that link together as a continuous story, especially toward the end, but it's a show that can keep your attention by changing the mood frequently.
