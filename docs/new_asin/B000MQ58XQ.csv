2739201,5,B000MQ58XQ,"I have always liked larry King but to sitback & to watch this D V D is to realize a couple of things one that I am not as young as used to be  but more importantly I realize how much I have experianced in my Life.

I would truly invite & encourage people to pick this up as it is a great way to relive History with the younger members of there family.",1179187200,5,351,3.72972972972973
2739202,5,B000MQ58XQ,"people have always dogged larry for being a softball interviewer.  I think he allows subjects to make or break themselves via their own words and actions.  It beats watching the shoutfests masking themselves as 'tough' interviews these days.

You either like Larry or you don't.  If you like the show, or have watched it through the years, you'll love this DVD set.  It really is outstanding.  If you don't like larry, which is apparent from some of the previous posts, then why on earth buy the DVD?

I highly recommend this DVD as a gift for the news conscience television/dvd viewer.",1177632000,12,586,4.742574257425742
2739203,4,B000MQ58XQ,"I ve been impressed with the first two discs so far. Its what Larry King is all about..nothing really too in-depth and a its a nice walk down memory lane. The second disc really brought back some of the big news stories over the years. I ve always enjoyed Larry Kings interviews and this collection does not dissapoint.

Last week XM radio devoted an entire channel to Larrys interviews over the years, and I taped as much as I could. These are a little more in depth. As much as I would have enjoyed full hour long interviews on some of his topics on these DVDs, I am enjoying the set, nonetheless",1177286400,15,598,4.339285714285714
2739204,1,B000MQ58XQ,"Well, I'm disappointed with the ""Larry King Interviews"" dvds.  I've only watched part of the first disc, which is the one with entertainers, but disappointed with the presentation.

The quality is great, but there is no scene selection or scene guide to any of the interviews, mainly because there are no complete full interviews with any of the people he talks to.  Just a hodgepodge of clips with the celebrities talking about whatever the subject is that he introduces (relationships, success, etc).

I'm sorry I bought this, I should have stayed with my original plan to rent it.

Oh well, that's the way it goes.",1177200000,27,617,4.838095238095238
2739205,3,B000MQ58XQ,"Dear Readers,

Larry King is a fixture on CNN, and I watch his show fairly regularly.  I watch his show mostly for the entertainment value of his program, not to see a series of stellar interviews.  Another reviewer on this page notes that King does not do any research into his show guests in order to keep the interviews ""fresh.""  What this strategy guarantees, however, is that the guests will be able to run with the show and talk only about what they see fit, totally sidelining King.  The ""interviews"" thus turn out to be more of a PR stunt to the benefit of the guests than anything else.  It is a rare case in which King does in fact do a great interview, but I have seen it happen!

If you want to see interviews with substance, do not watch ""Larry King Live.""  Watch Charlie Rose, or 60 Minutes.  Larry King's program is entertaining at times, but it is not worth watching for the interviews.

Happy Watching!

2739206,1,B000MQ58XQ,"....1 star for the great interview subjects..I'd give this 3 stars if they had an  option to watch without LARRY's idiotic interruptions.  This ""journalist"" claims he doesn't do any research on his subjects to keep his interviews ""fresh""...oye vey!  He is a moron!  The only thing worse than his on air interviews are his equally idiotic movie reviews...""The greatest movie  of all time!""...is standard for him.  How this guy has made the living he has for all these decades is proof that this country is going  to hell.",1176508800,11,520,4.840909090909091
2739207,3,B000MQ58XQ,"This looks and sounds like a good collecton of interviews from all areas of celebrity fields but where are the great sport stars inteviews, like michael jordan,ali,magic johnson,tiger woods and the interview larry did with mike tyson in jail,etc. I would have given this 6 stars if included a segment of sport stars,hopefully he can bring out another dvd just for the greatest interviews of sport stars past and present.",1175817600,14,420,5.014285714285714

 Larry King is a class act and this collection proves it. Great Value.",1354579200,,144,4.72
2739220,1,B000MQ58XQ,"I started seeing Larry King Hour on CNN in last 3 years or so until he retired. His interviews were fascinating especially the Lady Gaga one. This DVD set does not do justice to his career. Should have taken cue from Oprah Winfrey her DVD set is fabulous.

Here we have small clips of interviews rolled into one that leave you high and dry,irritated and tugging hair on your head on your folly in purchasing this set even after reading negative reviews. In certain case their is no introduction to whose interview we are seeing its extremely dismal. Avoid it like poison.",1323907200,,571,4.598039215686274
2739221,4,B000MQ58XQ,"As many people suspected this set does Not include full footage interviews, which sort of make sense, it would take 20 sets to present most of the full interviews thru the many years, but they present the best moments and footage of fun and important moments in the topic of the interview, my very favorite is the disc about the presidents, footage of the Reagan scare as well of Gerald Ford,.interview to John Kennedy Jr. I find it very nice to watch and is a good and entertaining trip to memory lane.",1300406400,2,503,4.478260869565218

2739224,2,B000MQ58XQ,"Interview for each person should be presented in its entirety for continuity of thought.

2739226,3,B000MQ58XQ,"Although I like Larry King and his style of interviewing guests I was disappointed that this set of DVDs jumps from one person to another and then back again instead of showing the whole interview in its entirety.  What I saw on TV as an advertisement is exactly how the DVD is so I guess I got what they portrayed, except that I thought that the TV ad was snippets of the DVD and not the actual DVD.",1181606400,30,400,4.128205128205129
2739227,2,B000MQ58XQ,"I gave this two stars because it was released at all.  I think atleast ONE full episode maybe of the first episode in 1985 should have been included.  Let alone, i should have been able to choose what interviews i wanted to see, you cant even skip chapters to various interviews without missing tons!  I was very disappointed with this DVD and returned it.",1181260800,19,356,4.53125
