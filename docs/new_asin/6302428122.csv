465918,5,6302428122,"Almost two decades later, Bill Cosby's masterful stand-up routine ""Himself"" is just as hilarious as it was back in 1982.  Why?  The topics he discusses are universal and have quite literally set the groundwork for lots of modern-day observational comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld.  From drinking on the weekends to the minutia of family life, Cosby takes in the details of daily life to filter out only the good stuff.
Cosby's dentist routine is one of the most fall-out-of-your-seat hilarious routines of all time, and even the most jaded of people will surely find humor in this.
Overall, it's impossible not to recommend this film to anyone who wants a riotous laugh, and I look forward to the day that they port this over to DVD so that it will become truly collectible.",972691200,10,774,4.804511278195489
465919,5,6302428122,"This movie just gets funnier and funnier everytime I watch it. His sketches include ""Getting Wasted On A Friday Night"", having a bad  day at the dentist, and the rest of the film is about family life, It's  just to funny when he talks about your face hanging on the floor, and your  bottom lip in your lap. So whenever I hear those two words: ""Bottom  Lip"" I just laugh histerically for some odd reason...Anyway, if you  like comedy, then you HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!",966902400,2,464,4.348837209302325
465920,5,6302428122,"Bill Cosby delivers perhaps his funniest standup routine ever in this 1981 concert film.
After a surprisingly tacky take on drugs - saved by his  sensational satire of an addict who goes to a fastfood restaurant - Bill  does dead-on takes on getting drunk and going to see the dentist.  He then  launches into the film's running gag - family life.  From a natural  childbirth sketch that outdoes every such episode of any comedy series,  Bill goes to the art of actually rasing children, and details the  innocently vicious antics involved - such as scolding the son when he  shaves his hair, dealing with a bratty four-year-old on a transcontinental  flight, and how every night the wife turns into Xena The Warrior Princess  when the kids turn bathtime into war.
But perhaps the funniest part  comes when Bill reveals the ""real"" names of himself and his  brother Russell (best known from the Fat Albert cartoon show based on  Cosby's sketches) when they were kids.  There is also the surprising  concern of mothers when their sons are in automobile accidents.
Chances  are you'll be unable to stop laughing at this stellar concert tape.",966297600,10,1138,4.84375
465921,5,6302428122,the material was fantastic&timeless.i really enjoyed the Pacing of the Routine. Bill Cosby is a Genius pure&simple.a must see&have.,950659200,,131,5.947368421052632
465922,4,6302428122,"This video had me cracking up numerous times. This complete andunabridged version of his 1982 concert from Toronto, Canada is a truelaugh riot as opposed to the purely laughable CD album version, with only 7 cut and edited routines. I had it, and now I've sold it, I have chosen to keep this video for good. The first few times I viewed this hilarious classic, I couldn't believe ""The Cos"" would actually use ""Carlin and Diceman""-style terminology like ""Jesus Christ"", ""Dammit"" (not really that bad by today's comedy standards), and even ""A**hole"". Whoah Mama! Anyway, his take at the beginning on people using drugs and alcohol freely are knee-slapping humorous, as well as the section on his own parents becoming grandparents to he and his wife's five children. And speaking of his wife, oh wow, I really hope that she's not the vicious harpy that Bill jokingly protrays her to be. This video is great, I treasure it's presence, I like to watch it every week or so. A true comedy legend has been showcased tremendously well, and I certainly hope Mr. Cosby eventually re-releases his catalog of rare and obscure comedy recordings from the late '60's, '70's, and mid '80's. I look forward to that, I hope it's done. See this video, you'll enjoy it immensely!",948931200,21,1258,4.8018433179723505

466860,5,6302428122,"08-08-2014  Taking a break from reviewing Classical Music, my passion, I hit on this copy of Bill Cosby's live, in Toronto, I think, performance taped a long time back.  Funniest damn guy in the world, he has a lot of serious ideas for better racial relations for all of us.  We're just FOLKS, that's all, just people and his stories are so natural and true, and  funny, that he is my neighbor in my ""dream Neighborhood,"" along with my Grandpa Dub Taylor, my uncle Sir Lawrence Olivier and Orson Welles, plus Jimmy Stewart and a few other great guys.  Why? Because they are so real, real men with real ideas and stories, some poignant, some just crazy.  Each can brighten my day so much, but ""Cos"" is my favorite comic, all-time, NO competition.
  A dentist, who had been a patient of mine one year, told me that he plays the dentist story for his patients before they sit in his chair, to put them at ease.  WOW!  Bery funny!  If you have kids, with ""brain-damage,"" these tales will hit home, as you hold your side from laughter.  So true!  I didn't like the section on drugs, because as one who has struggled with pain killers for my Crohn's, this is not a funny subject, so I always skip past it, but, still, this is Cosby's best DVD and a treasure for everyone.  If he doesn't help you to laugh at yourself, you are beyond hope--and, I hope not.  But=y Bill Cosby, Himself sit back and laugh your head off, or I'll get my shotgun and blow your face off!!!!  L.O.L.  a thousand times, at least.  The 5 most hysterical stars in the sky and an over the top recommendation for this great

467252,5,6302428122,"Some of his stories/ routines may be slightly outdated at this point, but it's still hilarious. I'd heard some of the lines before but there's no amount of sound effect that can replicate the humor involved in just watching his facial expressions.

I think the second half of the show was better than the first.

I probably don't remember all the segments, but the section on drunks (""having a good time""), dentists, sons and daughters, and others kept my whole family entertained. There are a few slow points, but some of the segments take a little setup. Of course some sections were funnier than others, but as a whole, this is a wonderful sampling of some classic comedy routines.

Parental note: There are a few curse words contained w/in, but mostly the show's just funny and practically timeless. If you've ever been to the dentist, you can relate to at least half the things he's talking about. I don't know if a teenager would find the same level of good humor in this work, but it would be interesting to hear their thoughts.

I haven't laughed out loud that many times in a long time. Drink soda with caution while watching.

Conclusion: Well worth the $. It's probably not something you watch then turn around and watch again and again on loop, but it makes a great gift for somebody else or for yourself.",1389830400,4,1317,4.611111111111111

467515,5,6302428122,"Unlike numerous comedians who rely on many controversial topics, Bill Cosby goes against the grain. His humor is mostly straightforward. He rarely swears and he doesn't count on lowbrow jokes for most of the time. His stories involve his marriage, his children, his adulthood, and dentists. This standup act may not be as groundbreaking as those from Richard Pryor, George Carlin, or Eddie Murphy, but Cosby's act is more realistic and maybe hits closer to home. What you get from this DVD is 100 minutes of genuine hilarity from one of the most famous standup comedians of all time. You won't hear many toilet or sex jokes, because that's just not his shtick. You will, however, find yourself laughing at Cosby's facial expressions, dialogue, and body movements as he reenacts scenes from life that we are all familiar with.

Mentions of probblems with his children, wife and parents were great to watch, for humor and possibly a humorized version of our own points of view. Part's that weren't as fun, were the pregnency (although I was still laughing), having a ""good"" time (Can't decide if I should laugh or roll my eyes, thinking of the situation) and the ever changing background behind Cosby, really? You go to Orange, Yellow, Tercoze, blue, violet, black and back again.

Call me a fuddy-duddy (at the ripe old age of 33), but I like my comedy like I like my underwear - clean.

Cosby delivers.  The opening few minutes are entertaining enough (i.e. the foils of drinking too much), but Cosby really hits a home run when he gets to the material about his kids.  Growing up in a large family myself, I could relate to his stories, and got a newfound sympathy for what my parents had to go through raising four kids.

468051,3,6302428122,"1) Humor
Humor is subjective, but I will tell you my opinion of this performance.  The classic dentist routine appears early on and is comedy gold, but aside from that I personally didn't find the first half as funny as I would like.  This had me concerned, wondering if I was about to waste a hour and half of my life.  However, to my relief, I found the second half to be very funny as he talked about his kids and parenting.

2) Offensive Content?
Different people are offended by different things, but I want to point out two things that some people might find offensive/problematic:
a) Very early in the performance Cosby has a routine talking about how people act when using alcohol, such as the different ways different types of drunks walk.  Cosby also talks about people snorting cocaine.
b) Very late in the performance Cosby jokingly talks about how when he was young he thought his name was ""Jesus Christ"" due to his father's exclamations.

3) Production
The DVD includes a Full Screen and a Wide Screen version on a double-sided disc.  I watched the Wide Screen version on a 46"" TV and thought the video quality was very decent considering this is a 1983 performance.  The only bonus feature I noticed was the trailer for the performance.",1318723200,8,1251,4.6289592760181

I recently ordered this DVD version for a friend to replace a VHS cassette that had literally been worn out from repeat viewing and averted a rebellion in her home.

I want all my grandkids to see it. Bill Crosby has the talent to take normal life, and make it so real and funny and applicable to what everyone goes through every day. We recognize ourselves in it. As others have said before, The Dentist's Skit is absolutely hilarious, and the bit about the drinker's ode to the toilet is even better. I always wondered what people who drank found so great about ending up hugging a toilet? Pregnant women end up doing that if you get morning sickness...I certainly didn't want to do that by drinking!

There has never been anyone like Cosby, and there hasn't been anyone like him since then. Everyone else since he has gotten older and retired, hasn't been as good at noticing the normal things in life, in family life and bringing it to our notice as how funny it is...without making it dirty or offensive. He never had the need to do that. He never had to put in four letter words, or make his comedy so bad you couldn't let your kids hear it. And his smile? You knew what was coming...just in the way he smiled. I miss that. Sometimes, he gets a little preachy now, but most of the time he is right about what he is preachy about. And he has been through so much with the loss of his beloved son. I will always love this comedy and always love him for what he has given us.",1309824000,3,1457,4.222222222222222

468088,5,6302428122,"The first time I saw Bill Cosby was on Jack Paar's program in the early 1960s, when Cosby was just out of college.  He did his routine on Noah reluctantly building the ark at God's bidding.  In a subsequent program he did the Revolutionary War routine, in which the two sides tactics were decided like the flip of a coin at the start of a football game.  It was immediately obvious that he was headed for great things.  He broke barriers as a comic, then as an actor in a primetime crime series.

This disk is of a more mature comic, after he was married with children, and most of the comedy is about that.  He never resorted to offensive language to get nervous laughter from an audience pretending to be so very hip.  This is the vintage stuff, a seamless stream of telling us what was funny n his own life and acting it out.  If you've never seen the Cos as a solo comic, this is a good place to start--or a good place to remember him if you're an old fan--like me.",1306368000,,969,4.2

(I deal with plenty of incompetent people who act like bad children in real life.) No use of the f-bomb needed, not that I care about that, but for anyone worried about ""bad language"", there's very little of that here. The show is approx. an hour-and-a-half long. Along with his infamous & riotous dissertation of being a father to five children, he makes true-to-life (and thus, funny) comments about co-workers, people who go out partying every weekend only to come to work on Monday worn out from their two days of ""fun"" & thoughts on his own parents becoming grandparents (and changing drastically in personality over the years). He's an intellectual through and through, and it shows it every bit of the routine. I find more to appreciate here the older that I get, and I've always enjoyed it. I am so glad that a comedian of this caliber had such a humorous special done on film. The only thing I dislike is that Mr. Cosby didn't do more of these specials!",1285804800,,1252,4.568888888888889

Cosby touches an array of normal life situations that are as current today as they were all those years ago. Tha sketches about the dentist, the weekend and most of all the parents/kids situation are for the ages.

My favorite part is about the grandparents so sweet and giving to the grand children as they never were with us: ""my father come to my house giving money to my children and I thing that is not my father, that's just and old man trying to get into heaven!!! Thats the same man who, when I asked for 50 cents, told me the story of his life, and he never told a happy story..."" Who cannot relate to that?

468276,5,6302428122,"Himself (Bill Cosby, 1983)

Back when it originally came out, I saw Himself so many times it's one of the few movies where I've actually lost count of the number of times I've seen it. I also own the album, and wore out two or three copies of it on cassette in the eighties. (Thank heaven for the CD!) I DVRed it from one of the commercial-free channels a few months ago and saved it to watch with my daughter recently; she's about the same age now I was when I first saw it, so it seemed a natural. My daughter's one of those kids who laughs at comedies, but is horrified of being seen to like things that won't be seen as cool (for example, she goes into fits of giggling when I sit her down in front of an episode of Are You Being Served? or The Golden Girls, but still professes to hate them), so I figured I'd get the same reaction here. It seems, though, that Bill Cosby is still cool. We've been going around the house intermittently singing the Chocolate Cake for Breakfast song ever since.

Cosby, of course, went mainstream (and kind of boring) in the mid-eighties with The Cosby Show and Bill Cosby Mysteries, but as a standup comedian, the man has been a king among kings since the sixties. I've always thought Himself has actually been his best set; pieces of it (including the Chocolate Cake for Breakfast song and the immortal first line of the album: ""Dentists tell you not to pick your teeth with any sharp metal object. Then you sit in their chair..."") have become cultural icons, quoted even by those who have no idea where they came from. Unlike the album, though, the film of Himself is not the entirely-wholesome image that Cosby kind of grew into after The Cosby Show started airing; his first monologue here, about drugs, is not off-color, but it's definitely a mature theme, and Cosby proves himself as hysterical when walking the same ground as folks like Richard Pryor and George Carlin as he is when doing the family-oriented stuff. (During my drunk years, I always used to do the ""oh, toilet bowl, you're my only friend"" routine when I found myself in, erm, that position.)

This is straight-out four-on-the-floor funny stuff, and it remains the finest standup video I've ever seen. Great stuff. And I now have evidence, though it's the smallest of sample sizes, that new generations are also finding Cosby as funny as us old folks. This is a must-see. **** ",1243814400,,2387,4.531322505800464
468277,5,6302428122,"I knew Bill Cosby had done stand up, but I had never seen it until I watched this recording of one of his shows from 1983.  The man is absolutely hilarious.

As a warm up of sorts, he starts out by talking about people who use alcohol and drugs to have ""fun"" on the weekends.  Then he discusses going to the dentist.  Finally, he gets to the main event where family life is skewered.  Everything from ""natural childbirth"" to trying to wrangle 5 kids to the change from parents to grandparents (watching his parents make the change that is) is fair game here.

Those looking for something visually stimulating will be disappointed.  This is just Bill, a microphone, and a chair (which he sits in more often than not) for the entire time.  But please don't let that stop you.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  And his observations are absolutely true, too.  At times he has a point to make, but he makes it with dead accurate humor.

And this movie is mostly clean, too.  There was one word early on and a bit at the end I didn't appreciate, but we're talking about a minute out of an hour and forty-five minutes of comedy.  I'm not complaining.  His wife comes across a bit harshly at times, but he also comes across as lazy.  These bits probably wouldn't fly today, but they work when you remember one element of comedy is exaggeration.

Cosby is able to make us laugh and make us think at the same time, which is a rarity these days. For those with children you will definitely see yourself here. He takes everyday things like going to the dentist (normally not very funny) and makes them hilarious. Puking your guts up when drunk isn't something I would put on my list of all time funny things to do, but Bill puts you there and makes it real, and it becomes funny. The best thing about Cosby is he doesn't have to use needless profanity just to fill time like others who aren't talented enough to do so. If you don't believe me, buy this and see for yourself.

468430,5,6302428122,"I was three years old when Dr. Cosby gave this performance for HBO.  The following year came the first season of The Cosby Show.  It took me over twenty years to learn how closely connected Bill Cosby Himself was to the creation (and duration) of The Cosby Show (especially the pilot episode).  For me during the 80's, it only mattered that this special didn't include Phylicia, Sabrina, Lisa, Malcolm, Tempestt or Keshia.  (And of course, there wasn't Geoffrey, Deon or Raven.)

Then, we entered the 90's, and I fully awoke to the differences between situation comedy, film comedy and - ta da - stand-up comedy.  Once I finally got the gist of stand-up routines, this show made all the sense in the world.  And, I fully grew to love it.  One of my favorite moments in the show is the segment, ""Natural Childbirth.""  (It wasn't until right before I purchased my copy that I learned the origin of the cheer, ""Push him out, shove him out, way out,"" which would appear in the Cosby Show pilot.)  But, the reason I loved that segment best is that one of my siblings and I used to imitate Dr. Cosby's vigorous Lamaze breathing (""Push, push!).  Between that chapter and the Dentistry topic, I almost started calling Bill ""Bottom-Lip Cosby.""

When this show was first recorded, I was so curious what it was like to fly on an airplane.  After watching the ""Little Jeffrey' chapter, I'm glad I didn't.  I may not have behaved any better as a four-year-old than that kid, if I'd flown.  Now, in my adulthood, that experience would just imbrue my joyous childhood recollections - even though I may have behaved no better than Dr. Cosby's actual children behaved.  Now, how did some of you other Pepsi Generation kids behave with your parents or each other?

[And, it's not too often that you see envelope-controlled floodlights whose amplitude rises and falls based on what comes out of Bill's microphone.]

Well, it's time to head for the dentist.  As the good doctor says, ""Thank God for gravity!""

It has the ability to take the viewer back to childhood and remember the family environment and all those growing pains.  It has the unique ability to place the viewer in the present and just how things are in their own family after growing up.  His stories are heartwarming and filled with the human element of life in general with everyday struggles to just make it.  The concepts will never grow old and the lessons continue as life teaches us that it is a fun place to be regardless what stage we are going through at the present.  Every family should have this.  If you are single, you need it too.  Somewhere in the past you probably had a family happening too.  Bill Cosby is so human and so humorous.

He did this skit a year before The Cosby Show and you can tell where he gets his humor from:  his own family.

468634,5,6302428122,"This has got to be one of the funniest dvds I own.  It's a bit dated, and I do get sad when he speaks of his son, Ennis, who ended up being murdered in real life (but not by his sisters, so there), but as a whole it packs a lot of laughter into one stand-up routine.

Dr. Cosby pokes gentle but perfectly-timed fun at drunks, dentists, parents, children ... the list goes on.  If you've ever been drunk (I haven't), seen a drunk, given birth (I haven't), heard stories of friends who gave birth, been to the dentist, tried to raise children, manipulated your siblings against parents and each other, wondered about newborns and grandparents, heard how haaaaaard it was for your parents when they were your age, felt frustration around somebody else's manic preschooler ... or experienced any of a myriad of common siutations upon which he comments and illustrates, then The Cos will certainly tickle your funny-bone with his descriptions.

The copy I have is close-captioned, and while many of his guffaws come from sound effects, a Deaf or hard of hearing person could still enjoy this routine.  Blind or visually impaired folks will also find a lot to laugh at despite occasional reliance on funny walks, facial expressions, etc.

Buy this dvd and grab the whole family to watch it.  Invite your friends, Democrat-Rebuplican-Libertarian-Green-Whomever -- this brilliant entertainer will give everybody at least a couple of smiles.

I still laugh out loud like I did when I was ten years old, but NOW I laugh for completely different reasons. After several years spent working with other people's kids and having kids of my OWN, I have a whole NEW appreciation for his routines on parenting (brain damage, ""I don't know"", and forth).

When my wife and I were on the way to the hospital for the birth of our first child, I was preparing myself for all-out war  because all I could think of was his ""Natural Childbirth"" routine from this concert.

468692,5,6302428122,"This is probably Cosby's finest moment in stand-up (or sit-down, as it may be) comedy. He has really honed in on his famous persona as an intellectual who insightfully discusses family and life issues. As much as I like more edgy and biting comedians like Carlin, Pryor and Hicks, Cosby proves here that you can be laugh-out-loud hilarious without cursing. And, though his perspective appeals to a wide audience, he always remains very sincere. The DVD version of this performance adds to the experience you'd get with an audio CD, too; although Cosby doesn't run around the stage, his subtle use of facial  expression and gesture is well worth seeing.

Sadly, in recent times live comedy audiences have changed- they have very little attention span and expect a punchline every two sentences. If he was starting now, Cosby- with his leisurely pace- might not get the attention that he deserves. But he remains the all-time master of comedic anecdotes. And if you get worn out by constantly watching modern joke tellers, employing formulaic and fast-paced humor, it's a breath of fresh air to watch a man sit down, discuss life, take his time, and just plain be a funny guy.",1137974400,4,1174,4.865

This is unbelieveably funny; I think the most amount of time you don't laugh is maybe five minutes. The setup is simple just a color-changing background, and a chair on a stage in an auditorium as the man himself struts out onto the stage as we see at the beginning. He covers so many topics like drugs and alcohol, dentists, his personal stories from his childhood and with his own family like the chocolate cake for breakfast, ""the same thing happens every night"", grandparents, little Jeffrey on the plane trip who says ""I was three but now I'm four years old."" He makes absurd things about families sound funny but they are so true and you can actually relate to the whole thing. You can just picture every story as he tells it and it feels like you're actually experiencing it. The one about the chocolate cake for breakfast, where his wife supposedly screeched out loud: ""Where did they get chocolate cake from?!!"", the dentist, and brain-damaged children are the best. Bottom line: if you want to laugh real hard, and I mean that you almost bust your gut, you must see this film. It's Bill Cosby...himself.",1137888000,,1311,4.630901287553648

The Coz is actually a storyteller; he examines everyday life, adds a few twists and turns and makes you look at things in a different way.  Posers like Chris Rock are neither funny nor entertaining; they're tiresome at best.  They lazily pick the low hanging fruit and spew out 1 liners like a politician to get the crowd cheering.

I have introduced this DVD to my kids and they have proven that Cosby's comedy is timeless; both my daughters were rolling on the floor throughout this show.  What a nice thing, huh?  You can actually sit down with your family and enjoy a comic together.",1136764800,4,775,4.572463768115942

Anyways, I stopped viewing this after 30min as I had not laughed a single time. The jokes about the weekend and alcoholics, as well as the much vaunted dentist skit, were all terribly weak.

This is primarily a collection of routines about his immediate family, mixed with opening routines on the effects of drugs and alcohol (which were not included on the LP), some cute stuff on dentists, and a few gags about his father and brother Russell.  The record album is edited, by the way, so this dvd is better off for your library in that respect.  This interestingly enough marks the 3rd version of this show I've seen.  The first time I saw it (and currently have on tape) features a song during the credits written by Cosby and his long time tv associate Stu Billett called ""It was a good idea at the time"" (hence my title).  The first time I taped it, it had NO BACKGROUND MUSIC whatsoever.  This copy (on both sides: Full Screen on one or Widescreen on the other) features a song called ""Just the slew of us"" and features some of the gags from this show in it.

I'm glad to say this is a faithful reproduction, by far mostly unaltered.  Only maybe the very beginning moments or very end moments are slightly different from what I recall.

In any case, great material.  Maybe not as funny as I remember it when I first saw it, but that's only because today's standard for what is considered funny shares little company with Bill Cosby's classic style.  Hopefully things come back around soon.",1092528000,5,709,4.669354838709677

Bill did it and did it without profanity and did it very funny.  This is a classic old HBO special from some years ago but I saw it several times and highly recommend it.

468822,5,6302428122,"Silly Bill Cosby comes alive on stage in Ontario,Canada and on movie screens almost everywhere. The opening theme song is entitled IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME. First,Cosby talks about drugs. Normally,he's no trashmouth but he does mention once and only once the vulgar slang word for ""anus"",""rectum"",""idiot"" and ""jerk"". Then he talks about dentistry,the subject that opens the soundtrack album which is entitled THE DENTIST. ""Dentists tell you not to pick your teeth with any sharp metal object."",he tells his audience. Then,there's what's entitled on the album,NATURAL CHILDBIRTH. Cosby tells about pregnancy,the joyous aftermath and what his wife Camille went through when she was pregnant with the Cosbys' first child. ""You just had a lizard!"",Bill tells Camille after the birth. The audience breaks into uproarious laughter. Then there's Cosby's definition of BRAIN DAMAGE,which is disobedience and immediate forgetfulness. A child is told by an adult not to do something then when the adult turns his/her back and turns it around again,the child is caught violating. The adult asks the child,""If you were told not to do it,then why did you do it?"" The child answers,""I don't know!"" That subject is carried over into what's entitled KILL THE BOY. The boy is Cosby's now-deceased son Ennis. Bill comes home from a tennis game and Camille tells him,""I want you to go upstairs and kill that boy!"". Bill tells Ennis,""Your mother sent me here to kill you!"" What motivated this? Ennis gave himself a haircut. Bill asked Ennis,""What happened to your hair?"". Ennis said ""I don't know!"". Then Bill asks,""Was your head with you all day today?"". Ennis said ""Ah-hah!"". Then Bill asks,""Did you cut your hair off?"". Ennis replies,""Ah-hah!"". ""Why didn't you tell me that then?"". Ennis replied,""I don't know!"". Another funny moment in the Cosby household was when Camille wanted Bill to cook breakfast for the couple's five children. Bill reluctantly complied with Camille's order after being threatened with a shotgun and a bucket of ice water. So he proceeds with a frying pan and,as he tells in an angry tone,the damn bacon,sausage and the(""you have to be careful with"")eggs. The Cosbys' youngest child,then-age 4,spotted chocolate cake. She asked her father if she could have some of the cake. The other four children decide to have the same thing after seeing the 4-year-old eating it. That relieved Bill from the duty of cooking. They were all happy eating the cake and listening to music until an angry Camille came along and shouted,""WHERE DID YOU GET CHOCOLATE CAKE FROM?"". Bill replied,""THEY ASKED FOR IT!"". One of the children then said,""We asked for eggs and milk and Dad made us eat this!"". Bill then tells about the nightly routine in the Cosby household entitled SAME THING HAPPENS EVERY NIGHT. After dinner Camille tells the children,""Go upstairs,take off all your clothes,get into the shower,use the soap and shampoo,rinse yourselves off,dry yourselves off,get into your pajamas and go to sleep. Now if you do as I say,there will be no beatings!"" However,there's a scuffle between Ennis and his two younger siblings. The youngest one feared she'd be blinded for life because shampoo has run from her hair into her eyes. This scenario has been re-enacted in the premiere episode of NBC's ""The Cosby Show"" in 1984. Angry Camille then grabs a yardstick and according to Bill,""holds it like a Samaurai warrior"". Camille announces,""THE BEATINGS WILL NOW BEGIN!"". Then Bill talks about grandparenthood,entitled THE GRANDPARENTS. Bill of course is referring to his mom and dad and Camille's mom and dad. Bill's mother was an authority on pigsties. All she had to do was find a shoe lying upside down in a room and to her that room was the filthiest she had ever seen,according to Bill. Bill's dad would fart and shift the blame to ""invisible animals"". The soundtrack album is on the Motown label. A must for all Bill Cosby fans.",1077580800,4,3929,5.046153846153846
468823,5,6302428122,"I still have vivid memories of being a kid and hearing Bill Cosby do his The Dentist sketch on a show called Solid Gold.  It was easily the funniest thing I had ever heard in my life, and I went around telling everyone just how hilarious Bill Cosby was.  At the time, I only knew Cosby from his Picture Pages segments on Captain Kangaroo and the Fat Albert cartoons, and I actually felt like some type of visionary when a little television vehicle called The Cosby Show debuted soon thereafter based to a large degree on the comedy you will find on both the album and video of Bill Cosby, Himself.  A few of the skits in this performance were translated almost directly to the screen in the show's first few episodes.
The Bill Cosby, Himself video is hilarious; I still laugh every time I watch it, no matter how many times I've heard the routines.  There was a time when I practically had The Dentist memorized, but I still love to hear it (and I felt privileged indeed to hear that story told again on the occasion I had to see Cosby perform live some years after this video came out).  Cosby's humor resonates so well with audiences because he is describing and joking about things we all know and understand to some degree.  He doesn't need to use foul language or tell dirty jokes in order to reach his audience.  He comes in, sits in a plain old chair in front of the live audience at Toronto's Hamilton Place Performing Arts Center, and just starts talking about the humorous things in life.  The audience feels as if Cosby is one of them, and the connection between audience and comic is immediate and powerful.
The comic material on Bill Cosby, Himself, deals primarily with family life - marriage, children, etc.  He makes the birth of his first child a hilarious journey into the delivery room, explains that parents age and lose a lot of their intellect because of the brain damage that characterizes all of their children, explains how differently his parents treat his own children compared to the way they treated him, offers a wonderful illustration of the talent fathers have of getting out of doing things, and describes quite vividly some of the antics of his own five children over the years.  He also describes the typical weekend activities of people who go out drinking and questions just how hangovers and nausea can be considered essential parts of ""having a good time.""
Bill Cosby knows people, and he knows what will make them laugh; he is also one of the greatest storytellers in the world.  He is at his funniest on this video, and I really can't imagine there is anyone out there who would not enjoy watching Bill Cosby, Himself.  This is comedy at its very best.",1075507200,125,2693,4.575883575883576

He has the ability to make humor out of every day circumstances, that to some wouldn't be so funny and he does it in a good clean manner.

As Cosby has gotten older, his comedy has changed.  I can't say it's gotten worse or better - just that it's different.  I suppose it's because he's looking at the world with more experienced eyes.  It's therefore a pleasure to see what he was doing twenty years ago when this was recorded.
There is, sadly, one routine Cosby does that just isn't funny - but that's only because of circumstances.  I'm referring to his comments about his son, Ennis - who, as we all know, was tragically killed by a man who thought he was robbing a drug dealer.  At the time Cosby did this routine, it was probably very funny.  Of course, he (and we) had no way of knowing that approximately fifteen years later, his son would be taken from him way before his time.
Listening to this particular part of Cosby's monologue, I just couldn't help remembering Ennis' murder - and because I remembered that day, I just couldn't laugh with him.  I doubt that Cosby would be able to do this routine today, even five years after Ennis' death.

Clean, yet frank, Cosby found a niche of family-humor that not only resonates across races and ages, but is able to be watched with your youngest ones without having to explain (or trying not to explain!) awkward sexual humor.
The insight Cosby brings to the mike is profound and subtle. He'll force you to consider your own childhood and laugh, realizing his dad and your dad are similar, and that he has turned into his dad.
The curse, as he would say, to have childhood, will get you eventually. Then you'll pull your hair out too.

Almost every one them tells tasteless jokes, filled with comments about (bad) intimacy with the girlfriend or specific bodily functions.  The tasteful comedian is a dying breed it seems.  Humor has descended to its lowest common denominator.

Bill Cosby, Himself is great proof that you don't have to be tasteless and obscene to be funny.  His comedy is clean, and has always been, which makes him a breed of performer I find to be very rare in today's market.  It is this fact, and the fact that he somehow is able to capture life in its truthfulness and bring out the humor in it that makes him among the best comedians of the past 50 years.

For me, a guy who's had extensive dental work done, every time I see the dentistry bit, I can't stop laughing.  He had it, right down to the sound of the pick on the teeth and the drill slipping.  It wasn't funny when I was having it done, but Cosby somehow can bring it out.  This is where his comic genius shines.

Almost every level of family life is included in this video, including childbirth to sibling rivalry.  This is a wonderful video for when you are down and need a good lift too.  There are very few comedians these days that can be this funny without being vulgar.

I still remember the very first time our family sat down (as a whole which was somewhat of a miracle back then!), snacks and drinks at the ready and paper towels to wipe hands.  Well, needless to say, the paper towels were used to wipe the tears from crying so much from hearty laughter and no drinks or snacks were ever really consumed.  We were just too busy having a really great family night.
