5112318,5,B007W54M4G,"If you wish to practice any style of Japanese Karate this series will help with the exceptions of Goju and Uechi ryu.  This is traditional Japanese style Karate...  not disco hip-hop American tournament kuroddy.  No padded Jhoon Rhee foam coozie gloves here folks.

6 hrs of Japanese Karate instruction on 6 DVDs.  However, only the last DVD has nearly 2 hrs of instruction on it.  They could have put all 6hrs of Instruction on THREE DVDs IMO...

Now for the actual review:

Good Points:  While the Instructors are Wado champions their instruction is generic enough for ALL of you Shito, Shoto, Kyokushin, Shudo and Shorin Ryu/Kan stylists to learn from this series.  I suppose a COUPLE of complete beginners could too.  The voice over info and technical corrections ARE good enough for beginners to actually learn from IMO.

If you want to learn ""Traditional"" Japanese Karate this is the series for you.  One of the instructors must have studied some Kyokushin or Muay Thai too.  His leg kicks certainly aren't your standard G. Funakoshi round kicks;-)  BTW this IS NOT knock down/teeth spitting instruction either.

Instructional actors are both Men and WOMEN.  It is about time.  Way to go producer.

Bad Points:  1.  Already mentioned 6 DVDs for 6hrs instruction.  If your going to put out 6 DVDs you should have 2hrs of instruction on EACH of them IMO.

2.  Why aren't Naihanchi and Seishan katas taught???  How can you claim to teach to BB level and not teach these fundamental Karate Katas???  Every style of Karate teaches some form of Seishan and Naihanchi is a Kata that should be learned by EVERYONE- even you Goju guys and gals.  Those two kata are fundamental katas.

I also believe that everyone should also be taught Sanchin and Tensho katas before earning their BB too.  And if your ""style"" doesn't have them- STEAL THEM from your friendly local Shito Ryu Sensei!  A few Guinness Stouts after class should seal the deal IME;-)

3.  Lighting could have been better.  The instructor/producer should have borrowed/rented/purchased some Photography lighting.

4.  Different fighters should have different color dogi.  Bruce Tegner had that figured out back in 1959.  Perhaps I should become a Producer/Director...

5.  They could have used more karateka in the filming of this series.

Normally I would only give this series 4-stars but because of the dismal quality of Japanese Karate video instruction available here in the US I am going to give this program 5-stars because the Producer/Instructor actually tries to teach the pupil/viewer some skills instead of just making your normal Shihan ego over-inflation DVD like nearly ALL of the USA produced martial art instructional videos do.

France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the U.K. have Karate instructional DVDS (and much higher quality JAPANESE style instruction but the USA does have better OKINAWAN Instruction IMO) that are SO much better instruction wise than US DVDs-  with the exception of my old instructor Yang Jwing-Ming.  YJ-M ACTUALLY gets it.  His kung fu DVDs all have 2+hours of actual INSTRUCTION on them...

Hey American Martial Arts DVD Producers and Directors: how about less Instructor EGO and MORE actual Instruction!!!",1378684800,23,3208,5.038167938931298
5112319,5,B007W54M4G,Worth owning for any martial artist.... even you are not a Wado stylist. Great for help with kihon and kata.,1375056000,4,108,4.45
5112320,5,B007W54M4G,"The Black Belt In You home study course on Wado Ryu Karate is one of the most complete and enjoyable presentation of this system ever recorded.  It belongs in the library of every Wado Ryu practioner from beginner to Black Belt instructor. This series most certainly would have pleased, Hironori Otsuka, the founder of Wado Ryu karate.",1368576000,6,335,4.87719298245614

I could find on the Subject.
I am now in the Process of Ranking
with the Solo Martial Arts Council,
Wado Ryu has a lot of great moves and I
work with the Katas with my son. They offer
no distance learning so I whent with

5112322,5,B007W54M4G,"This 6x DVD set goes into incredible detail about everything you need to know to get to black belt standard in Wado Ryu karate. It includes basics, kata (forms or patterns), bunkai (the explanation and application of kata), blocks and counters and the theory and application of sparring - both free sparring and competition techniques. What I particularly like is the onscreen highlighting of what the narrator is explaining - a very useful visual aid. There are also demonstrations of how NOT to perform the various basics and techniques which is also a useful teaching aid.",1351036800,7,575,5.0
5112323,5,B007W54M4G,This is very professionally produced and impressive. They break everything down for you so you can learn what to do step-by-step. Unlike other DVDs it points out common mistakes that I didn't even realise I was making. I would definitely recommend it for anyone else who is working towards their Wado Ryu Black Belt!,1348963200,8,316,4.87037037037037
5112324,5,B007W54M4G,My kids do karate so I got them this DVD box set. It is very well thought out and put together and my kids love the way they can jump to whatever section they want.

8522413,4,B007W54M4G,"great overall, felt that using a low ranking student and placing her in a dark light. Good basic technique, but for black belt, there should have been more on fighting and pressure points, and more detail. Thanks for for doing a great job on filming.",1415836800,4,250,4.5777777777777775
8522414,5,B007W54M4G,"For a 5 month beginner all I can say is WOW! The concepts are easily explained with great clear videos, with sound overlays of a clearly spoken lightly accented easily understood pleasant English voice & no echo. The people placement in the videos are where every necessary maneuver & foot placement is highly visible to the viewer & explained, sometimes slowed for clarity, small yellow circles to enhance attention to detail, and words on the screen to identify concepts. What a terrific training program. The snapping of the punches & kicks of the Black Belts' uniforms are reminiscent of the early Chinese TV movies and provide motivation to achieve the same effect/results during practice for when needed.

The order was originally delivered on time as expected. Now I'm going to have to clean up my computer room so I can practice in front of the screen. Thanks for the terrific program & training aid.",1390262400,5,908,4.896103896103896

Furthermore, you will get authentic Wado Ryu Karate instruction from some of the best in their field.
With the professional production, instruction style, and material offered the series could easily be priced at ten times more of what it cost.
Martial Artists and anyone interested in a quality DVD program should avail themselves of this particular Wado Ryu series.
Highly recommend.",1382140800,6,443,5.253521126760563
