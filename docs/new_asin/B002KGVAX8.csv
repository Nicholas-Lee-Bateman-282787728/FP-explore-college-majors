3940210,5,B002KGVAX8,If you have watched Mavericks Live in Texas then this live performance at the Royal Albert Hall is a must. I had not realised that this show was done in late 90s and was earlier than Rod Stewarts live performance in about 2008 and his first. The mavericks put a lot of energy into their shows and I would love to see them live here in New Zealand should they ever venture this way albeit Raul Marlow and what ever line up he has. A top DVD and another to our collection.,1282348800,12,470,4.119565217391305

3940220,5,B002KGVAX8,If you're a Mavericks fan you're going to love this DVD! Every song is sung with so much energy& the ballads just show the fantastic voice of Raul Malo! The crowd at Royal Albert Hall are usually reserved & laid back but these Brits were standing & jamming in the aisles! What a great addition to my Mavericks collection! Received this DVD really fast & would buy from this seller again.,1407024000,,387,4.464788732394366

3940223,5,B002KGVAX8,"The English people are very sedate in other concerts I've seen from Royal Albert Hall. During the Mavericks show you see them dancing in the isles.  The energy from the band is so good. Every song is a winner could have gone on for 30 more minutes without problem a real winner!!! Production quality is also top notch, for the price a really great buy...",1398643200,,354,4.446153846153846
3940224,5,B002KGVAX8,I would classify this as early Mavericks and of course with different personnel than they came back with a few years ago.  Regardless it is excellent as a performance goes and I've come to expect nothing less from these guys.  From a standpoint of producing this DVD it must be noted that there are no audio options and the sound was just fair to good.  This would have been awesome if they remastered this in 5.1 surround sound.  As a performance it is 5 star worthy.,1394409600,,468,4.406976744186046
3940225,5,B002KGVAX8,"I love Raul Malo!!!  It is interesting to see how the group has evolved since this was recorded.  They have grown immensely!

3940228,5,B002KGVAX8,"I purchased this album along with ""Live In Austin, Texas"" and the CD ""In Time"".  I love all 3 of them.  ""Live At Royal Albert Hall"" is the best in my opinion.  Raul Malo got into this concert early which added to it and the British audience was really ""gettin down"".  The stodgy old British made the Texans look like nursing home residents.  This concert was really rockin.  The music was a great blend of country, latin, and TexMex.  Highly recommended.",1388707200,,454,4.530864197530864

3940240,5,B002KGVAX8,"The Dvd is a copy of the original VHS recording. But whatever... the feeling they bring to England is great. As they do La Mucara, which they announce as the Melbourne Mambo, those british stiffs hit the roof. Great concert. Sound and vision are acceptable. Next to the Live in Austin concert as must have for any Maverick Fan!! I Love Raoul Maro!!",1302566400,2,348,4.5396825396825395
