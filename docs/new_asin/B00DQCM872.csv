8596273,2,B00DQCM872,"I had never heard of this term ""school to prison pipeline,"" but this program covers that trend.  This work may be great for letting ppl know about juvenile justice issues.  The MSNBC channel has a program called ""Lockup Raw"" that shows life in prison.  Sometimes the show films in juvenile detention centers.  This Tavis show may try to be unique in speaking on how these young ppl get an education when they are on lockdown.  Really, the program should have perhaps focused on that more than it does, but this may be a great start.
The program covers both boys and girls, but still says the problem is disproportionately male.  The program starts by suggesting this could affect all ethnicities, but then goes on to say it is especially harming Black and low-income communities.  The program is diverse in terms of region, covering centers in Washington State, Louisiana, and elsewhere.
The most important statement to me was when one expert opined, ""Kids need help, not punishment.""  A big issue about corrections in general is that it doesn't correct, it just punishes.  Many here said what others have said about adult prisons:  people learn how to break more laws, rather than learn how to avoid breaking laws while they are locked up.
Lately, Smiley and Dr. C. West have been maligning President Obama in ways that many of us African Americans dislike.  I am glad that this program makes no swipes at our President.  The first eight minutes of the program that sets up the issues in the concern were more informative to me than the following dull interviews that take place.  I didn't enjoy this program as much as Smiley's ""Too Important to Fail.""  Still, I thank him and all those involved for introducing a problem to the masses which many may not have known existed.",1402444800,,1776,4.761437908496732
