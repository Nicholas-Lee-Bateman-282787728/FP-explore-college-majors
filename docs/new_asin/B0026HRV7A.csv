8352595,5,B0026HRV7A,"This performer Mark Merchant has one hour and thirty minutes of clever clean and current comedy with a cast of almost  a thousand characters. His ventriloquist skill is amazing.
I loved this DVD almost as much as the live show I saw of his in Reno, Nevada.

Buy it and you will also realize that Naked in a Full Length Mirror is worth twice the price!",1245196800,,351,4.303030303030303
8352596,5,B0026HRV7A,"While taking a cruise with my wife for our tenth anniversary, one night I found myself reluctantly being dragged to a show featuring this guy.  It was near the end of the cruise and I had had enough of the pretty boy singers in their purple sequenced tuxedos and the puffed up, heavily made-up leggy dancers your mother always told you to avoid, so I wasn't really expecting too much from this fellow.  But I had an hour to kill till the midnight buffet so I thought, what the heck.  And although I'm not big into ventriloquists, (I often thought guys like this got beat up a lot in high school) I did enjoy Mark's show with his irreverent sense of humour and take on life.  Nobody escaped he and his three little friend's barbs.  Even the captain of the boat was fuel for his falter. It was a very enjoyable evening by a very talented entertainer.  Buy the DVD, you'll laugh you head off.  And sex will be better with your wife.  Mine was that night.",1245024000,,951,4.333333333333333
