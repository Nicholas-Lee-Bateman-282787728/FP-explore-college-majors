8687044,5,B00P9FC2TS,Bordertown is all on single sided discs with Season 1&2 in one box and Season 3 along with 2 double-sided Gold discs in the other.  Appears to be the same packaging for Bordertown as other offers.  Currently this set is offered at a price below the Bordertown alone series - so this is a great deal.,1458950400,,299,4.321428571428571

8687046,5,B00P9FC2TS,This is an interesting series that I had never seen before. The Canadian scenery and variety of plots in the episodes kept my interest. Reminds the viewer of american  TV in an earlier time.  It's something the whole family can watch together and enjoy.,1440115200,,253,4.7272727272727275
