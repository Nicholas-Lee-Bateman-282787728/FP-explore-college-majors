7998126,5,B0000C23EV,Both movies are by far two of my favorite comedies that I have and that i've watched....super troopers is the topic of discussion all the time between my friends and I as is office space....both movies are quoted religously all the time and they are well deserving of that because of the hilarity of both movies...great lines great plots great stories and the actors were hilarious...recommend to buy both movies if anyone is looking.,1150502400,,434,4.878378378378378
7998127,5,B0000C23EV,"Oh my god!  You couldn't possibly put two better comedies together!  Well, maybe you could, but it all depends on taste.  We have office Space with Super troopers, the last being my favorite of the two, for the price of $25 (give or take).  You save a bit of cash, and it's absolutely perfect if you don't have either of the movies.  Perfect is really the only thing that comes to mind.  Well, actually there is one thing that did bug me, and that was the lack of extras on Office Space, while there are plenty on Super troopers, but this package is perfect nether the less.  It makes an excellent gift so go ahead and click the buy button!",1110585600,,640,4.283333333333333
