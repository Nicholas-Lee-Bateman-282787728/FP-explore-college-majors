2765049,1,B000NDFLWG,The least informative documentary I have ever seen and I am a career student.  This documentary provided no proof for its claims.

2765051,5,B000NDFLWG,This is clearly a great flick that lets the viewer 'see' how the banks view you the credit consumer.  It really goes into accurate detail on how the finance industry is trying to snare consumers from and young age and create a generation of debt slaves.  They also have a chilling prediction on where all this 'debt' is heading.  I highly recommend this flick.,1203638400,,360,4.59375

2765054,5,B000NDFLWG,"Every senior in high school and freshmen in college should watch this film! It lays out the important issue of personal finance very clear. At some point, young adults will see how important maintaining good credit, mastering a budget and committing to saving will pay off--for good or for bad.",1190764800,3,294,4.9
2765055,3,B000NDFLWG,"This is a very good documentary on the subject of credit card debt and predatory lending, but doesn't pack the emotional punch of a similar documentary titled Maxed Out that came out roughly at the same time.  The documentary shows as a society that the middle and lower classes are drowning in a sea of debt from payday loan places and credit card debt.  It offers some good advice and gives a lot of cause for concern, but leaves you with a feeling of unanswered questions and wanting more information.  It does however show you that debt is often not caused by stupidity or foolishness but by circumstances that could affect any one of us.",1187308800,9,642,4.565217391304348
2765056,5,B000NDFLWG,"Keep up the good work Danny!
I hope you do another documentary on this ever expanding problem.
Reward cards are something that need looking at more closely.
Who is actually paying these ""rewards"". It's the merchant fees that we all pay for whether we use credit cards or not! Fact is, many people can't use a reward card or simply don't want to deal with greedy credit card co's and their long list of dirty tricks and yet they don't get a discount when they pay cash because everywhere you go, they take credit cards. And that means merchant fees that we all pay in the form of higher prices!  And these card co's have it set up so the merchants can't give a lower price for cash customers! It's outrageous!
And I hope you do more about debt buyers. It's insane these co's can buy debt for pennies on the dollar and then pile on more interest.  Interest is supposed to be charged for money borrowed!  Nobody borrowed money from a debt buyer and yet they can charge interest! It doesn't make any sense to put someone in debt further.
And last but not least, these predators who flood the mailboxes of the newly bankrupt should not be allowed to send them any mail for at least ten years. That is the amount of time bankruptcy remains on someones credit report. If the newly bankrupt want to get back in the credit card game, then let them find these cos. There should be a law that these co's with their dreadful offers not be allowed to send offers to those who have just gotten out of bankruptcy. Unfortunatly, some will not understand these offers or will be desperate. They are nothing but a trap wrapped in envelopes with seductive message like ""we want to help you re establish your credit"" or ""you deserve a second chance"". Those who have filed bankruptcy have gotten a second chance and these predators only want a second chance at ripping them off and putting them in debtors prison again! These co's will even extend credit to people living below the poverty line!!",1184803200,5,1975,4.495821727019498
2765057,5,B000NDFLWG,I went on a debt reduction program on my own at 42 years old and now at 45 I am debt free. I recommend that you buy this DVD at any price. I also recommend that you don't watch it alone. Let some others benefit from the knowledge of what debt has and is doing to our society. Even if they don't do anything about it at least they will have the education of how the debt system works.,1183248000,,383,3.8607594936708862
2765058,5,B000NDFLWG,"Americans spend more money than they make and that's the modern trend in today's society.  This stems from the fact that it is so convenient to live this way but it is also a progressive danger to consumers and the economy.
The public faces a daily barrage of advertisements for credit cards and lending options and it filters down to everyone in all walks of life.  In 2005 alone, the top 10 credit card companies spent over 2 billion dollars in advertising.

Commercials have been shown to use subtle and creative messages to tap into your subconscious desire to spend money but no attempts are made to educate individuals about any fiscal responsibilities.  The situation is even worse when you realize that many companies have inflated interest rates, they overcharge on late fees, and some often misappropriate confidential consumer information such as you personal credit history.

Looking at the dilemma of this debt crisis begs the question of what is going wrong.  A big element is the fact that rising costs of healthcare, housing, education, and consumer goods hurts so many and credit and lending play a significant part here.  The federal government is another factor that does not favor the consumer and hurts you more than it helps.  Recent bankruptcy reform initiated by President Bush now makes it more difficult for persons to file bankruptcy and recover from financial hardship.  Powerful lobbyists in Washington are very influential in helping to manipulate fiscal policies and financial institutions are the number one contributors to political campaigns.

There really isn't any happy ending in sight to this widespread problem but there is a growing light at the end of the tunnel.  Consumer advocate groups are becoming more prominent nowadays and their attempts at debt education and awareness are steadily working their way into mainstream society.  Any type of help whatsoever is productive and necessary for everyone affected and this keeps the hope alive that we can eventually make significant progress in overcoming our huge dependency on borrowed money and credit.

`In Debt We Trust' really appealed to me because it was quite comprehensive in how much material it covered and because it was presented in an easy to understand and straightforward manner.  For informational and educational purposes, I would seriously recommend this documentary to everyone.",1181606400,19,2390,5.206266318537859

8176973,1,B000NDFLWG,"just checked out this video from my library.  biased liberal crap.  the movie spends most of its time bashing conservatives & the republican party, blaming them for foolish americans living beyond their means, and then wanting someone else to bail them out of it.  no way.  i thought it was way past-due when the gov't adjusted the bankruptcy laws.  americans love to spend, but when their debt catches up with them...oh no, someone else to blame.  you get yourself into debt, you get yourself out of it.  hard-core conservative tea-partiers like me have always lived frugally and within our means.  those simpletons out there who lived on credit-cards get nothing from me but my middle-finger in their face.  they have to learn their lesson the hard way, i guess.  the entire video has that colored obama-loving beatch, rep. sheila lee, flapping her jaws about how its all the bank's fault.  no one's buying though.",1395792000,,916,4.883116883116883

8176975,1,B000NDFLWG,"One thing I want to point out about this documentary is it starts out talking about personal credit card debt and approximately 30 mins into the documentary starts to talk about national debt and how much national debt the U.S. owes. In economics, personal credit card debt and the national debt are two very different issues. I find it dishonest that the filmmakers would mislead consumers by lumping both types of debt together - they are separate issues and need to be addressed as such.

I would agree with the part of the film where it states ""debt is a much larger symptom of economic and structural issues facing households"" and that ""households are facing declining and stagnating incomes while costs are skyrocketing"". I certainly agree that public policy must be changed to address such issues, however, the film barely touched upon this topic.

I kept waiting to hear solutions the film would propose to address personal credit card debt in this nation - whether those solutions be on a personal or national level. In the end, the film gave about a 5-minute soundbite on the how this issue needs to be addressed at the community level.

Overall, poorly organized documentary that goes off on tangents. The mention of faith-based solutions at the end without elaborating on what such solutions are rounded off an already weak movie.",1333670400,5,1342,4.903083700440528
8176976,5,B000NDFLWG,"This powerful program exposed the credit card industry and how with the political power of Congress trap the consumer into what the program produced called ""21st century serfdom"".

This program was made before the 2008 economic melt-down and it was so true that the country is still on the rocky road despite the government declared recession was over two years ago, as the unemployed max out the 99 weeks of benefits.

As recent as last week, the political leaders of both parties argued in Congress to raise the debt ceiling to borrow more while still accusing others of currency manipulation.

Spend, spend, and spend out of a recession?  Will our kids, grand-kids, great grand-kids inherit this debt which may endanger our status, credit and national security?",1307232000,,764,5.0396825396825395
8176977,4,B000NDFLWG,Sharply critical of our national and personal use of debt to finance lifestyles beyond our means and an indictment of the credit/banking/mortgage industry engaged in predatory lending and usurious interest rates. This film came out in 2006; it's eerily prophetic of what happened to our economic house of cards in 2008.,1270339200,,319,5.2745098039215685
8176978,4,B000NDFLWG,"In Debt We Trust warns that the U.S. economy is heading for collapse due to our massive borrowing. Given the current state of the economy (and the role that mortgage debt played in the crisis), the filmmakers appear to have been prescient. I don't think that this is a perfect film, but it held my attention.

The filmmakers score points when they discuss the marketing of credit cards to young people, especially college students. The film includes stories from many people about the problems their debts have created for them. In one good scene, the filmmakers pawn a car title; the scene is both entertaining and educational.

This film travels much of the same ground as another documentary, Maxed Out. Both films include clips from the same film. I like both films, but I prefer Maxed Out because the material seems a bit fresher. I also think that the filmmakers should have included more material about the need for Americans to take some responsibility for managing their debts and becoming financially literate.

In Debt We Trust does a great job of starting a conversation - about debt - that is long overdue in the U.S. Given that about 2/3 of our economy is based on consumer spending, I am pessimistic that the government will do anything to discourage debt. Individuals, however, are free to choose a different path for themselves.",1266537600,2,1345,4.839130434782609
8176979,5,B000NDFLWG,"While on vacation several years ago my wife and I got roped into a timeshare presentation.  At the end, I told the salesman, ""We don't have the money for it.""

He smiled, saying, ""Finance!""

Finance vacation?  A house and a car are the only purchases for which one should borrow money.  And I'm not even sure about borrowing for a car as I pay cash for mine, but then, I buy only used models.

The documentary IN DEBT WE TRUST shows just how legal loan-sharking has become in the United States.  Credit card companies and subprime mortgage lenders break Americans who have not already lost their shirts to unemployment and medical bills.  Perhaps no one forces people into the traps of A.P.R.s and A.R.M.s, but this film demonstrates how the creditors hoodwink their victims.  Holding a gun on them would be honest, at least.  IN DEBT WE TRUST includes testimonials from people who should have put off that vacation rather than take a loan for it or kept renting rather than buy a home.  That smiling timeshare salesman may as well have told me, ""A place to go on vacation every year?  Priceless.""

And what do America's leaders have to say as this consumption culture destroys people's finances? As George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani said shortly after the 9/11 terror attack, ""Go shopping.""  Later, Bush would sign a bill limiting Americans' bankruptcy options.
