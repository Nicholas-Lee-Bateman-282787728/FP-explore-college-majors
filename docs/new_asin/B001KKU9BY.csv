8315136,5,B001KKU9BY,"I was perplexed by one reviewers complaint.  Obviously two teams participated in this and every other bowl game that has been released on DVD.
  Would anymore fans from the defeated team buy the DVD merely because it included the schools logo on the front cover?  Ahhh  No.  If so, here's a simple solution; remove the DVD jacket.
  Would it be worth it for more than a handful of fans to have a special feature ""Road to the ????? Bowl"" for the team that lost?  It would be an extra expense to the 90+ percent of the purchasers that probably wanted to see more special features of their school instead of the other.

As for as the ABC/ESPN is concerned they are marketing it to the audience that will be the overwhelming purchasers; the victorious.  They know that the losing team's fanbase purchase of the DVD will be microscopic.  I'm not going to whine about the 2006 Rose Bowl having nothing but Texas on it because THEY WON.  They deserved the attention.",1246406400,3,959,4.538011695906433
8315137,1,B001KKU9BY,"Keeping it simple - the last I checked it takes two to tango and two teams to play a football game. From the DVD it appears that Southern Califronia played the game alone. As I recall, Penn State was also on the field.",1241222400,,218,4.093023255813954
