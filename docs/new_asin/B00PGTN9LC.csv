8687797,5,B00PGTN9LC,"This is a very very funny movie while Steve and Tina were perfect as the married couple. I had no idea that there was going to be pretty decent paction scenes in it and so that served as an extra bonus in my opinion.

As a side note Mark Wahlberg is also in this movie and he was fantastic too! The interactions between Mark, Steve and Tina was just hilarious and I didn't want it to end.

This is one of those movies that you can come back to after the first viewing and probably laugh even more than you did the first time! Highly Recommended!! A++++",1527724800,,552,4.149532710280374
