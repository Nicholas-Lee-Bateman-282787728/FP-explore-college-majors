Obviously, if you've read this far, you know it's from circa 1989 so it's VERY dated and at 20 minutes, way too short. There's no real stretch at the beginning as there should be, so I do that before popping in the tape and I play the aerobics part twice to get about 30 minutes or so of getting my heart rate up. That said, I was breathing hard and worked up a little sweat by the end so it served that purpose. Most of all, for those of us who have been working out since the eighties and don't care for the newer so-called ""aerobics workouts"" and just want to get the heart rate up without thinking about needlessly complicated choreography, (or jumping around on that darn step!!!) this is not a bad place to start.",1109030400,,848,4.273291925465839
