8227137,1,B000X7S91M,"I made the mistake of buying the more expensive of two dvd versions of this film--a mistake.  This more expensive version is in fake ""wide screen,"" accomplished by compressing the image so that the actors look like people in a ""fun house"" mirror.  The  movie was made in the early 40s--the correct aspect ratio is 1:33 to 1--just about fitting a standard tv screen.  I don't know whom they thought they were fooling.  Get the cheaper version; I did(and returned the other to Amazon) The image is clear and undistorted/uncompressed and is in ""full"" screen.
PS the film is delightful and risque if one reads between the lines, see comments on IMDB site.  My purpose here is to warn off people from one version and steer them to the other....",1202688000,3,739,4.6461538461538465
