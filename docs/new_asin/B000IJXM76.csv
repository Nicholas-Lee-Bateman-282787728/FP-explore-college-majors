8145951,5,B000IJXM76,"This is our family's favorite ""Best of the Muppet Show"" DVD.  All three episodes contain vintage Muppet humor, music and mayhem!  We have ""worn out"" one DVD and we're purchasing a new one.  The Harry Belafonte ""Turn the World Around"" segment has wonderful puppets and a great message. The Linda Ronstadt and John Denver segments are tributes to these stars and the wonder of the Muppets.",1337558400,,387,4.833333333333333
8145952,5,B000IJXM76,"I love this particular video. I had been looking for this Muppet video for a very long time.  It was great to watch Harry Belafonte sing and teach the Muppets how to sing the Banana Boat Song. It's hilarious. It was also nice to see Linda Ronstadt sing Blue Bayou, with some little creatures singing in the background. It was so cute and funny. I also enjoyed the songs from the late John Denver.  He looked like he was having so much fun on the show, as the rest of them.  Finally, it was a wonderful added touch, of the son of the late Jim Henson, sharing some background information about the producing of the shows.  This is a wonderful video the for the whole entire family-if you like the Muppets.",1214179200,5,703,4.343511450381679
