Unlike some reviewers here, I feel if you haven't seen Jubei-Chan, The Ninja Girl - Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch this second series won't make any sense and will only cause confusion due to its highly unusual mix of serious action and slapstick buffoonery.  The set of four episodes included on this disc picks up almost exactly where the first series left off with little attempt at explaination of the setup or introduction for any but the characters new to this particular tale.  Though several years passed between the first series and this, most character design and backgrounds remain faithful to the original, with improvements in the fluidity of the action scenes.  Only the design of Jubei-Chan herself bothers me a bit; for some reason, her original Japanese voice actress has also been replaced by Yui Horie, probably best known here as the voice of Naru Narusegawa in Love Hina.  ( As usual, I ignore the dub cast. )

In case you're really unfamilliar with Jubei-Chan, let me say right off that there are NO ninjas among the main characters who are best described as ""swordsmen/swordswomen"" or samuari.  Any ninjas, such as there are, serve mainly as a sort of background comic relief.  ( The original subtitle ""The Ninja Girl"" seems to exist only in the English version and to have been used for its ""catchy-ness"". )  Schoolgirl Jiyu Nanohana is the VERY reluctant reincarnation of legendary swordsman Yagyu Jubei.  Unfortunately for her, Jubei created veritable legions of enemies and rival swordsmen while he lived, and now some 300 years later they're still looking to get even.  Though in the first series Jiyu managed to exorcise one group of them from a rival ""school"" of swordsmanship, another clan has learned of Jubei's reincarnation and has journeyed from Russia to kill her: these are the Siberia Yagyu of the title.  Complicating matters considerably is the appearance of another, deadlier rival, Freesia Yagyu, the recently revived 300 year-old daughter of the original Jubei, who is seeking to assert her own claim as her father's successor.

Merely stating the cast of characters, situation, and plotline of J2 fails to convey the essential wackiness of the way the story is told.  This is so well-established over the expanse of the first series that to jump into this one would probably be a turn-off and leave anyone trying to make sense of the events very cold indeed.  The entire story is littered with in-jokes and references to the first one that will be frustratingly meaningless to anyone who missed it.  Though there are subtle ( and some not-so-subtle ) changes from the original, this is mainly a fun romp very much in the spirit of the original.  There are obviously heart-tugs ahead for Jiyu and her ""Fake Family"", but if you liked Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch, the Counterattack of the Siberia Yagyu should please as well.",1314403200,,3021,4.938735177865612
8057895,5,B00097E6UE,"This review wants to compare vs first series

A lot of reviewers for this set said that this series was more serious than first one & comedic moments felt out of place. This may be if one rushed through the series as I did. However, at the second viewing, I found the comedic moments wonderful especially if your cup of tea is japanese anime comedy style.

But the most wonderful thing about this series is the level of detail & work in the animation. Certainly the extra detail was the result of more money to spend vs the 1999 introduction & it was helped by the improvements in action sequences after MATRIX in 1999 as the action is more HK style cool. A lot of reviewers said the action in first series was very good.

That may be in 1999 but it looks very generic & very short to be considered good. This they improved on.

In terms of story, there is more improvement & more dramatic impact. I felt the first one was very redundant in Jubei-chan refusing the Yagyu Jubei persona & mantle but here it was more subtle.

I would say this is the series you want to get if you have to choose ONE. If you enjoyed it, it would not ruin your enjoyment of the first one.",1122681600,5,1167,4.238738738738738
8057896,3,B00097E6UE,"Like it's first series, Jubei-Chan 2 has the same feel.  Short, fast fight sequences with a little too much stupid, kiddy comedy.  Those looking for more sword play should look else where, but those who like more comedy with a little sword play here and their, this is a good one.",1120435200,,280,4.470588235294118
8057897,2,B00097E6UE,"Given that it's a sequel, I had my suspicions about Jubei-chan 2--the first series is one of my all-time favorites.  This is not.  Even if it did not have to measure up to the original, it would struggle to be mediocre.  As it is, with its awful changes to much of the returning cast, Jubei-chan 2 borders on unwatchable.

The story is not the problem: Jiyu is confronted by yet another group clinging to a 300 year old grudge (this group is a side branch of the Yagyu who were exiled) and by a girl with her own eyepatch (a spade to match Jiyu's heart-shaped eyepatch) who claims to be the real Yagyu Jubei II.  In other words, no great literary feat, but not unexpected for a sequel.

The problem lies in the butchering of the returning cast.  Shiro, the heart of the original series, with his sword skill and his earnest feelings for Jiyu, becomes nothing but a useless buffoon.  Bantaro suffers a similar fate, being reduced to merely stupid, without any real humor.  It feels like this series was written by a group of people who didn't like or didn't care about the characters in the original.  Oddly, the writers seem to acknowledge this--several times, characters point out that things seem to have really changed since the original series.  They're right, and none have changed for the better.

If you liked the original series, I can't recommend this at all.  It will only disappoint.  If you didn't, this show is worse in every conceivable way, so it's hard to imagine you would like it better.  The original Jubei-chan, while enormously silly, had both heart and a spark of magic; this is just a grind of stupidity highlighted by one or two laughs an episode.",1119571200,4,1671,4.597972972972973
