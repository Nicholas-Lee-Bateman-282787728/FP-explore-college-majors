It kept my interest from start to finish.  Sets and costumes are wonderful, and capture the romantic glamour of a bygone era  - and its stars.  Worth watching!",1297468800,11,306,5.183673469387755
3872935,4,B0028RABYI,"""One Way Passage"", a Warner Brothers production of 1932, tells the story of a doomed shipboard romance between a convicted murderer and a girl with only weeks to live. The plot is absurd but that doesn't detract from the stunning treatment by gifted director Tay Garnett. Edited to an economic 69 minutes, this film defies the normal cheap Warner Brother's house style. The camera is on the move the whole time, giving the film a vitality so sorely lacking in many early talkies. William Powell and Kay Francis play the leads with simplicity and sincerity and as a result, the film avoids histrionics. Supported by Aline McMahon, Warren Hymer and Frank McHugh for comic relief, the story is touching and convincing. There are many excellent individual scenes - the leads on a moonlit beach with the subtle use of cigarette butts to tell us what we need to know but don't need to see, the amusing byplay between Roscoe Karns as a bartender and Frank McHugh, the bit of business with the broken glasses etc. There is also a lovely melody which can be heard when the leads are together, adding a romantic aura to their presence.

The film has been released in the Warner Brother's Archive Collection which means it is very expensive, unrestored and contains no extras, not even a scene selection or theatrical trailer in this case. The good news though is that, in contrast to the many lousy prints which this collection have released, the print of ""One Way Passage"" is almost pristine with bright clear lighting. There are a few pops and one obvious tear but that is all.",1295049600,20,1569,4.726277372262774
3872936,4,B0028RABYI,"A dying Society lady, a dashing, doomed outlaw on the run, an ocean voyage. This classic, tear jerker shows how Hollywood did it in the classic, romantic style.
Kay Francis and William Powell have that Style we hardly see anymore.  Suave, elegant, each with their own secret that can't be revealed until...

3872937,5,B0028RABYI,"My wife tells me that Til Schweiger is the most enchanting and handsome man that ever existed and his accent and acting ability is top notch. I kind of agree with her.  However, there are lots of good looking leading men and woman who can act. That being said, he was made for this role. His demeanor and calm but explosiveness fit the part to a ""T"". This is a low keyed, but action packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, even after watching it several times. I bought this movie and very seldom do I re-watch a suspense movies several times, however even knowing the ending, I am always  afraid it will end differently.

3872938,5,B0028RABYI,"I ran across this movie on demand and seeing that I am a huge Til Schweiger fan thought I'll watch some eye candy for 2 hours or so and maybe the film will be good too.
I loved it. The Birk family ,rich a good reputation, a daughter in love and engaged to their new star advertising genius employee.""Schweiger"" who had a taste for lot's of other women. Their sociopath of a son ""Anthony"" brutally rapes and sodomizes an employee and then blackmails Schweiger's character""Eddie"" using Eddies infidelities as leverage so Eddie rather than have his fiancee ""Anthony's sister"" find out gives Anthony an alibi. The rape scene is quite brutal,plus the poor woman was also raped as a young girl by four men as well. What happens after that is a roller coaster ride of a movie where you never know where it's going to lead, and it sure is fun watching and finding out. The Victim of the rape becomes the hunter and that's all I'll say.
The characters were played to perfection and you felt all the emotions the film makers set out for you to feel. Hatred,pity,disgust,and helplessness. I'm glad I took a chance on it and will now buy a copy so I can watch it again.",1267228800,2,1157,4.462264150943396
3872939,5,B0028RABYI,"Great fast-paced action, strong plot, excellent acting.  This movie is full of good surprises.  Til Schweiger and Lauren Lee Smith are outstanding.",1261699200,,147,5.636363636363637
3872940,2,B0028RABYI,"I feel the best way to review this film is to immediately address the well known (and valid) criticisms so that those offended by said content can stop reading and move on to a better film. The rape scenes, three total, against a man, a woman and a young girl were not necessary in either their length or graphic style. If you are offended by seeing rape(s) in film, skip this movie. The courtroom scenes were poorly done in so many ways, even from a novice standpoint, that the legal guffaws extraordinaire might shun some viewers. But if you made it through Til's perpetual annunciation problems up to that point, then maybe these two hours will not seem so painfully long.

We have a story of an ad corporation family hierarchy filled with liars, cheats and dysfunctional douche bags. Til plays the unbelievable front man who is marrying into the firm, but manages to bed whatever comes his way on the side. Before this story develops though we are treated to an opening scene gang rape of a teen girl who is then mysteriously saved by Michael Clarke Duncan's ""General"" character. MCD has four minutes of screen time throughout the entire film so skip this if you saw his name and wanted to watch for his parts. Then the story spirals further into blackmail, ""intrigue"", ""suspense"" and a variety of other buzzwords. Eric Roberts enters the film much later as a defense lawyer and unwittingly he became the comic relief, loved his part.

Quality wise, the film stock looked excellent and Til obviously sunk some serious money into the sets, design, cars and overall production. There are no special features on the DVD so there cannot be any extra stars, but usually Til's films do, so I was disappointed. The universal agreement seems to be that audiences outside the US loved this film and most cared little for it domestically. The story became unbelievable in so many areas that I have to fall into the latter group. You might get some entertainment out of this, even if you are not a Til fan, but all of the negatives make this a skipper.",1247184000,4,2045,4.6464088397790055

3872943,3,B0028RABYI,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

OK, I was cruising along with this cast of characters nicely and figured, oh well we all gotta go sometime, no biggie. Then, the last scene really hit me hard. I was so surprised, given that not much else happens unexpectedly and was even rather annoyed they made such a mess with those glasses.

Great credit is due to that pickpocket's laugh, thee best on celluloid to date and even better than that ""Simpson's"" Nelson punk. It did not annoy and found his antics most humorous, for that era quite an accomplishment.

I never got the Kay Francis craze, her girlfriends were much prettier but guess she is an acquired taste. She did look her best in the flowing white/light gowns and several angles enhanced her countenance.

Always interesting to see stock footage from the long gone era of Hong Kong, Queen Mary (?), San Quentin, etc. even though the frame inserts were cumbersome cuts. I would have liked to see more from a history POV.

High recommend for those pre-code romances (I think I saw a black garter on the dance floor!!), how to make a Paradise Martini (delish) and the advantages of having underworld pals.",1449964800,,1164,4.686274509803922

3872951,5,B0028RABYI,"One Way Passage (1932) is one of my favorite films from Warner Brothers in the Pre-Code movie days.  The story of the film is well described by other reviewers, so I won't add any spoilers.  William Powell is always a joy to see n screen and he is well paired with Kay Francis.  Frank McHugh is wonderful as Skippy who is perpetually drunk and light fingered thief. His partner in crime, Aline MacMahon, posing as the Countess Barihaus strings along wealthy Englishmen until she  falls for detective Steve Burke.

Director Tay Garnett's keeps the story on the move and keeps the audience guessing about the outcome. The movie was nicely transferred to DVD with good sound but there are no extras.

This guys fit and muscular body of course gets your attention  there is another scene  in the movie when he is wearing a t-shirt and tight briefs. Aside from the obvious eye candy I ended up liking this movie. He is forced to ride a bicycle to work after his 70 Plymouth Barracuda is impounded. On the way home from work he is involved in an accident on the bike and suffers a head injury. It is from that point on that our main character begins to develop a mental status change and you begin to have more empathy for this guy. I agree with the one reviewer that there is chemistry with the characters but was a bit agonizing that the changes he was going through were not taken too seriously at first. I felt a bit uncomfortable for him as I would have hoped family and friends could have been more supportive and more motivated to get him help but that was not the case.

3872967,5,B0028RABYI,"I can't believe how good this movie is. In a mere 80 minutes it will draw you in and share with you a side of humanity rarely seen in film. the two leads are excellent. Kay Francis exhibits a fragile vulnerability that will amke you want to wrap your arms around her and hold her. William Powell's nuanced performance play off of Kay's 'heart on sleeve' performance. The scenes on the beach in Hawaii and the final farewell are as well done as anything I've seen on film. It astounds me that this film is not more well known. The following are another person's words describing the experience of this film. I have included them because they express the impact of this film better than I ever could.
""There are times when popular culture produces work that transcends the ""pop"" and becomes deeply significant within that culture.  At its best it tells us -- convinces us -- that this is something important that we all share, deeply but often unknowingly until the product, the ""object"" that fulfills the function of art, gives us an example of that shared human existence.  It is the very definition of art.  It does not have to be epic in scope, obsessive in detail or in strict adherence to nature.  It can be very small, but true.  Truth in miniature, inside a locket that we rarely open, but when we do, it is as if we've never stopped looking or thinking - its impact is once again immediate, visceral and stays with us at least as long as our mortal senses allow.  Specific to a time, yet timeless.""

Directed by Tay Garnett

Dan (William Powell) is a condemned murderer who is being transported from Hong Kong to San Quentin by way of a luxury liner. Also on board is the lovely Joan (Kay Francis), who is suffering from a fatal heart condition. Steve (Warren Hymer) is the sympathetic detective escorting Dan and he allows his prisoner to roam the decks without handcuffs - opportunity Dan exploits by arranging an escape with two of his old cronies Skippy & Betty (Frank McHugh & Aline MacMahon). But when he meets Joan, Dan falls in love - and she is equally smitten, with the two conducting an exquisite shipboard affair, neither telling the other of their impending doom. Dan makes his escape, but is halted in mid-flight when Joan takes a turn for the worse.

Oscar Winner for Best Screenplay

3872970,5,B0028RABYI,"William Powell is best remembered today for his movies with Myrna Loy, but prior to those he was most successfully teamed up with several other actresses, including Silents opposite Bebe Daniels, and sound films with Carole Lombard. Powell also made several popular films with Kay Francis; 1930's ""Street of Chance"" and ""For the Defense"", 1931's ""Ladies Man"" - this also includes Lombard - and a delightful ""1932 feature, ""Jewel Robbery"". Immediately following this last film came the final pairing of Powell and Francis, ""One Way Passage"", a sentimental story of ill-fated love, and by far the best film the two made together.

Director Garnett used to make fun of Kay Francis's speech issues - she suffered from a bad lisp - but this cannot diminish Francis's poignant performance as a dying woman who falls in love with another doomed soul, Powell's convicted murderer, played with all his inimitable grace. Both lovers end up vainly trying to save the other in a manner not unlike the couple in the famous O'Hara story, ""The Gift of the Magi"". In the end we the audience are treated to one of the most touching scenes in American movies as the camera takes us instead of the now dead lovers to fulfill their promised New Year's Eve rendezvous at the Aqua Caliente Bar.

Caveat: A large number of Kay Francis films have recently been issued, but only in these expensive single film ""Archive"" formats. I find this disturbing since many of the films run for barely an hour, few if any show signs of 'archival' restoration, and there are no commentaries, extras.",1305763200,27,1562,4.846441947565543
