5878755,5,B00DYC6SWA,"For countless centuries the horse has been the indispensable helpmate of humankind.  Whether in peacetime or war equines have literally carried the burden of human activity.  ""Unsung Hero"" is a small, but moving tribute to the role horses, donkeys and mules played in the great human struggle we call the American Civil War.

Steadfast and loyal, the millions of equines that served both sides in the great conflict should always be honored for the shared sacrifice they made in life and death with their human brethren.",1392163200,2,520,5.023255813953488

8599126,1,B00DYC6SWA,This was terrible.  Information you can get with just 10 minutes of googling.  Who cares about the officers horses I want to hear about your average enlisted man's horse. They could have referenced so many journal entries of soldiers speaking fondly of their horse but nope.  Just crap poems.  And 9.99 to rent for a 48 minute video. Mostly PowerPoint quality only like 5 minutes of any real pictures the rest just some guy in front of a green screen talking.  It's what you'd expect from the video your teacher shows in 6th grade history because she is hungover and doesn't want to teach.,1459987200,,589,4.625

8599130,5,B00DYC6SWA,"I really enjoyed this video and am very grateful that it was available on Amazon. The streaming was excellent. As a horse lover and American Civil War  enthusiast, it was a wonderful combination of the remarkable role played by the horses, without whom, the war could not have been carried out. Their accomplishments were vast and their sacrifice very great. So many facts and details were brought to light. I especially appreciated the narrator's tribute to the horses who. So nobely carried their famous generals and how beloved they were. I have to say that it brought tears to my eyes. I have often thought that an entire book should be devoted to these great Heros.",1455753600,,670,4.775862068965517
