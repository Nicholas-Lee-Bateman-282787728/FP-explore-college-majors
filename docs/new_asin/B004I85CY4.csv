4384072,2,B004I85CY4,"My husband and I were very disappointed in this set of DVDs. We have always loved Jacques Cousteau's work, but these documentaries were repetitive and extremely boring. The same shots were shown over and over, and in some cases you watched the same footage for like 5 minutes while the narrator gave common facts about behaviors that they never showed. We love 3D but BOTH of us fell asleep a couple of times while trying to watch the series. We watched 2 out of 3 of these DVDs and haven't been able to bring ourselves to watch the 3rd. It's a waste of our time; if I could return them, I would.",1357603200,43,596,4.330357142857143
4384073,4,B004I85CY4,jacques cousteau son does very good... i miss jacque... i must say his son shows the same love of the sea that he did and all the wild life in it.. im so glad too see him filling with his fathers footsteps..

4384076,5,B004I85CY4,This is a great video to show the full power of 3D HDTV. Things will flow right out of the TV with this video. Also Cousteau does a very good job educating viewers on the magnificent under water goings on.,1347753600,28,205,4.15
4384077,4,B004I85CY4,The whole set is great some of the DVDs have over lapping info.  but overall the dvds are very informative and the 3d effects are great I actually felt like I was right there in the water with the sea creatures.,1331424000,22,211,4.146341463414634

The 3D effects are just that good.  The fish, whales, sharks, turtles....all swim in your living room.  Add to that the educational value and you've got a winning set of films.  I cannot tell you how much I love these!  If you want to awe your guest with amazing 3D this is the one to show them.",1446076800,4,468,3.967741935483871

Oh and if you expect to actually learn something , forget it, they hardly say anything of interest about the species. This was the most boring and short documentary ive ever seen.

4384138,1,B004I85CY4,"I have watched only 2/3 discs but this collection is not worth it. Lot of repetitive sequences and some scenes have been copy-pasted in a way where you can tell it is a repeat sequence. If you love looking at one lone sea turtle all the time, then you will enjoy this- in fact disc 3 should be retitled as ""Sea Turtle and a little bit of Ocean Wonderland"".
Very boring, and the narration is not great. The colors also seemed weird in some shots- may have something to do with the lighting used. Would definitely not recommend it.",1433635200,3,529,4.353535353535354
4384139,4,B004I85CY4,A story told from the fish's prospective different but informative worth the price 3D is very well done. Only drawback was the disc menu to choose closed captioning and chapter selection was not intuitive but discernible after a few tries.,1432857600,,239,5.0

interesting to watch.  One was of Sharks, one of Dolphins and Whales and one of general underwater footage.  The miscelaneous Disk was
like viewing a saltwater aquarium.  In one scene, an eel comes and just about touches the tip of your nose.  Good footage at a good price.",1427328000,3,404,4.47945205479452

4384160,5,B004I85CY4,"Just viewed these 3 disks Friday in 3D. The 3D is excellent. I haven't seen anything this good before other than in an IMAX theater. I really thought that the sea snake was going to bite me. The tiny little fish were practically swimming by my face. All this is dependent on what type of TV you purchased and what type of 3D glasses you have. The 3D glasses came with my LG 3D Cinama TV, so my review is based on my TV. When I purchased this collection there was no mention that I would also get the option to view the movies in 2D, so that was an added bonus. My grandchildren lose interest in the 3D rather quickly, so this features allows me to switch to 2D for the grandchildren. The color is amazing, the dolphins and whales commentator is female and her voice is soothing, and if you are tired you may fall asleep. The one on sharks and the corel reef is presented by the sea turtle showing you around the ocean, he also has a calming voice. Overall the 3D will not disappoint.",1422748800,6,983,4.2063492063492065

4384176,3,B004I85CY4,"Bought this series mainly to add 3D discs to my collection and thinking that the COUSTEAU name would guarantee something interesting . This clearly is not the case here, Jean-Michel is clearly not in the same league as Jacques Cousteau. This presentation is very bland, not very informative and the story telling is done as it was intended for kids. It is nice that it is a region free presentation with many languages to choose from but the other languages are so it seems, just a translation of the same dumb and boring. uninteresting English narrations.  It is presented in the form of a story as seen through the eyes of a turtle with here and there some supposedly funny remarks intended for more grown up ears.  The 3D-ness of these discs are O.K. but nothing really spectacular, and the colors are mostly blue-ish  grey in most of the scenes as if the whole movie was shot in the  same location. Only the disc ""Ocean Wonderland"" has a little bit more color to it because it shows some scenes shot around a reef area, but it has the same bland not very informative story telling as seen through the eyes of a turtle. I personally wish that the BBC would produce more of THEIR nature films in the 3D format because they are in general much more interesting and are usually of higher quality also than most others.",1412035200,25,1318,4.525210084033613

Jean-Michel's work is no less impressive. And the 3D show is a natural evolutionary step in the documentary-making, and I liked these titles a lot!

Honestly, the documentary, the genre where the stage is not being set, but shot captured, where there are not takes, not decorations, no bloopers, which are natural for movies, this genre is so naturally exist as a 3D show. I even think that *any* documentary must be shot and shown in 3D - it does make it feel 100% real, the exact goal of any documentary production.

PS. I have to admit that I could not watch the Sharks 3D... I was so scared, I just turned it off. Does it say how good this movie is?",1409356800,4,832,4.3896103896103895

4384184,4,B004I85CY4,Any that loves the ocean will love these DVDS. The photography is amazing. The only downside and not much of a big one is that the Sharks DVD was the only one in the set that is truly 3D (Based on showing on my Sony 3D Bravia and my Epson 2030 3D projector). The other 2 discs play in simulated 3D which is just not the same. A small but disappointing problem. The Sharks DVD will wow you in true 3D whereas the others do not.

I have to say I am pretty disappointed overall.  The quality of the 3D effects is just ok and the films themselves are sub-par.  There is no real storyline so you end up with a stitched together set of underwater shots with virtually no narration.  In fact, the lack of narration seems almost like the production company was paying the guy by the word and ran out of money to have him do the film any justice.  I tried all three films and honestly wandered away from the TV a number of times without pausing to get snacks or do some other trivial task.

While some of the footage is better than others, I was STUNNED to feel like a manatee was physically present in our living room and could be examined from every angle.  I actually found myself reaching out with the kids to try to touch it!  I can't imagine ever getting to have this experience in any other way.  We're only about halfway into the 1st disk on whales, but that one image alone was worth the price of the set and I'm sure we'll be finding other treasures, especially the coral reef.
