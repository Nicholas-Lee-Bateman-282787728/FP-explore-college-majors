8268572,5,B00187165C,"I have been working out for a long time and I can truly say this is the best of the best, of workout material.  I have only been using these DVDs for a few weeks but really see the difference from all others I have tried.  My arms are really pumped up without my elbows hurting; thanks to Tim's concern for proper form. I have all the DVDs and  work a different section of the body every day with abs done daily. I have learned the moves so I don't have to listen to all the explanation every workout; although Tim does have a lot of knowledge to share.

This is not a quick 20min workout; so if that is what you are looking for, keep looking. When you find you are not getting the results you seek, try Tim's program.",1243036800,,718,4.070921985815603
