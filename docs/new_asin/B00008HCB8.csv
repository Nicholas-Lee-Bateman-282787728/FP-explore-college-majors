1847898,5,B00008HCB8,"After purchasing the CD, I have since purchased the DVD.  I am glad that I did.  For any Beach Boys fan this DVD is a must have for your collection. All six members are present including Brian and Dennis Wilson. For those of us who missed the ""early"" concerts especially those of the mid-late 70's this concert will help fill the gap. The music is fine and the group is in excellant form, in fact they look like they are having fun  right along with the audience.  The images are very good.  Since we no longer have Dennis and Carl Wilson, and the Beach Boys are no more this DVD is a precious keepsake of Americas favorite band.",1049846400,17,629,4.296610169491525
1847899,4,B00008HCB8,"What makes this concert special and memorable is that all the Beach Boy's were together.  Three years later, there would be one less.
This was a 1980's concert filmed at Knebworth Park, Hertfordshire, England.  As to be expected, concerts from 20 years ago aren't as elaborate and sophisticated as they are today, however it's still the Beach Boys, and they were great.
Being at the end of the baby boomer cycle and definitely a lover of the Beach Boys in the Seventies, watching this concert was a thrill.  I found myself participating in the enthusiasm their songs generate.
If you liked the Beach Boys, buy this DVD.  It's a great keepsake.",1049241600,,643,4.7657657657657655

1847906,5,B00008HCB8,"This is a very good concert film.  It features all of the original members.  The Beach Boys perform good versions of several of their big hits.  Also, the band performs some good lesser known songs such as School Days, Cotton Fields/Heroes And Villains, Keeping The Summer Alive, and Lady Lynda.  I highly recommend this DVD to every Beach Boys fan.",1494028800,3,349,4.766666666666667
1847907,3,B00008HCB8,"There is no way on earth this is a 5 star DVD. My comments do not pertain to the song set or performance, but to the video and sound quality. The description says 5:1 audio, but that is simply not true as the center channel is non-existent. To fill the center sound vacuum I left my TV speakers on, and believe it or not, that did help. Also, the rear speaker surround is weak, but you can alleviate that problem by turning up their volume--not so with the center channel.

As for the video quality, it says 1080p. However, the video quality is equal to or worse than your old 480p tube TV and it does not sync 100% with the audio at times.

You might think I'm just a whiner. So I played my Moody Blues, Live from the Royal Albert Hall DVD and Led Zeppelin, Celebration DVD for a comparison. The video and sound quality of both just blew the Beach Boy DVD away. BLEW IT AWAY! But that is what you'd expect from recordings that occurred 20 and 27 years later.

For about $8 the DVD will not break you, and you do get to see the Beach Boys live. But don't expect a high-end production, becasue it ain't here.",1478995200,2,1107,4.187793427230047

1847909,5,B00008HCB8,"Forget about the sometimes poor quality of the performance and vocals. It was England and it was cold, but the Beach Boys warmed things with their catalog of timeless hits. What makes this DVD special is that it is a time capsule of the of the original Beach Boys performing for one of the last times prior to the tragic death of Dennis Wilson. The original band is here - Mike Love, Al Jardine, Dennis Wilson, Carl Wilson, and somewhat sadly, Brian Wilson. It's obvious that Brian was not up for this performance, but it is who he was at the time. Again, taken as a historical time capsule, this performance is significant. By this time, the Beach Boys were more of a jukebox act. They ripped through the hits.... and there are plenty. Surfin' USA, Good Vibrations, Surfer Girl, and more. Carl Wilson is in especially great voice on Darlin' and God Only Knows. The disk concludes with an especially rousing version of Fun. Fun. Fun.",1477353600,,933,4.592814371257485
1847910,5,B00008HCB8,"Well worth the money and a true Beach Boys classic concert. They all show themselves to be the true professionals, entertainers, and musicians they are acclaimed for, although it appeared to me that Dennis had a few awkward moments.

1847923,5,B00008HCB8,"Yes, this concert is way too short.  As the  Beach Boys were the penultimate act at the Knebworth festival with Elton John coming on afterward, they probably did not have much discretion in how long they could play.  It was great that the songs had punch they did not have on record.  The rocked-up beginnings to Help Me, Rhonda, Barbara Ann, and Fun, Fun, Fun really get you up and moving.  Even Brian was in good voice.  It is odd that the CD and DVD are entitled ""Good Timin'"" as the song was either not played at the concert or edited out for time on the CD.  While they played no songs from ""Beach Boys Love You"" (1977) or ""The M. I. U. Album"" (1978),  They did play ""Rock and Roll Music"" (15 Big Ones, 1976), ""Lady Lynda"" (""L. A. (Light Album))"" (1979), ""School Days,"" and ""Keeping the Summer Alive"" (""Keeping the Summer Alive"" (1980)).  The last, a Carl Wilson-Randy Bachman composition, really thumped.  The lack of rehearsal was evident when Al asks the band if ""Cotton Fields"" was going to be a medley with ""Heroes and Villains.""  (It was.)  ""Cotton Fields"" (1969) was a big hit in England which is probably why they performed it here.  The ravages to Dennis' own voice are evident in his ""You are so Beautiful"" solo.  True, they were already becoming dependent on hoary oldies like ""Be True to Your School,"" and I was disappointed that there was not more newer stuff.  Still, this is a great performance, and people who pass by my office when I have it on my iPod stop and listen.

I saw them about a year later.  This same line-up.  As Dennis died about six months after that, I felt fortunate.  They played mostly the same songs, so this CD & DVD is sort of a relic of the show I saw.",1440547200,3,1697,4.364217252396166

1847931,3,B00008HCB8,The Beach Boys were lucky to be together for this last go round. Dennis was wild on the drums. Brian was playing but was non existent as a performer.

You can feel so much emotion from each group member, their stage presence is the absolute best of any group I have ever seen perform., and any Beach Boys fan should have this in their private collections.

1847937,5,B00008HCB8,"To have a piece of musical history, a moment in time that can never be repeated to me is priceless !
This concert the BEACH BOYS performed in Knebworth,England was the last time, they performed together and it was amazing. Soon after, Dennis Wilson died, Carl Wilson passed, and Brian Wilson had a falling out with his cousin, Mike Love, the end result,it was thought, never to play together again.
Let me say the music content of this CD/DVD combination is well worth every cent you pay for this ""piece of vocal and musical history"" well worth it. You can watch the DVD and take the CD in your car and enjoy it wherever you go 'Surfin'USA.
Furthermore, everything Amazon.com did was perfect from ordering to delivering  this CD/DVD was excellent.",1369353600,,747,4.702290076335878

1847942,5,B00008HCB8,"To see all of the Beach Boys: Brian, Mike, Carl, Alan, Dennis, and Bruce (no David-the long lost BB) together again is amazing. England loved the Beach Boys at a time when the U-S was turning into Beatlemania and the new Hippie sound was beginning. England loved the Beach Boys..and in 1980..and Beach Boys returned it back.

1847945,4,B00008HCB8,"I saw part of this concert on Palladia, and figured I'd take a chance and order the entire show on DVD for myself, and a copy for a good friend of mine. With the exception of a couple 'slow' points, it was a stellar performance that included all their hits. Unfortunately, this was at the time that Brian Wilson was in the middle of his 'issues', and seemed to be someplace else during the concert.

This DVD should remind Beach Boys fans how good they were in concert ... this performance holds up along side the one they did at "" The TAMI Show "" back in the sixties ... these two shows are how the band should be remembered, not like what they turned into when they splintered into different factions.",1346457600,,703,4.325757575757576
1847946,5,B00008HCB8,"First of all, don't listen to the one star review posted by Amazon reviewer/loser named j-richard fugazi or some crap like that. The guy is a clown who wouldn't know good music if it hit em right in his ugly mug. This is a great show. I have owned the DVD for years and still watch it regularly. It is the best show that has been officially released (quality-wise) that features the three Wilson brothers. Brian's voice sounds pretty good here and the band is in top form. Highlight for me is Dennis Wilson's rendition of You Are So Beautiful. Get this if you love the Beach Boys",1336348800,2,579,4.37037037037037
1847947,4,B00008HCB8,They were a pretty good group in there prime & i feel everone liked the Beach Boys..Well I guess that must tell you my age....Tom,1326412800,,129,4.2
1847948,4,B00008HCB8,"My greatest appreciation about this concert DVD is that it offers one the chance to see the Wilson brothers: Brian, Dennis, and Carl, along with their cousin Mike Love, and their long time friend Al Jardine, (and others as well).  They were all there and they all sang so for that I gave the concert five stars.  To me, if anyone of them were missing, then the Beach Boys would be incomplete.  This may be one of the last  recorded performances which included all five of those Beach Boys.

It really saddens me that Dennis and Carl are no longer here.  It is fairly rare to see Dennis sing, despite some comments from other reviewers regarding his singing.  Too bad, that there aren't more vocal performances from him.  In general, I have to agree with other reviewers that this concert wasn't their best performance, and that they didn't look too good.  You have to bear in mind, that these are not their prime glory years.

In my opinion, at their finest, all five had great vocal ability, fine enough for each of them to sing lead.  I'm sure that many may recall the many excellent CD recordings of times past, from Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Al Jardine,  Dennis Wilson, and others.

On 1080 high def TV, the DVD quality is fuzzy or grainy, like other older DVDs.
For an ""older"" concert (1980), I thought the audio sounded fine through the TV speakers.

""God Only Knows"" where Carl and Dennis are now.",1313625600,5,1416,4.545454545454546
1847949,2,B00008HCB8,I was very excited to find a DVD of the Beach Boys but found the sound quality to be very bad. The picture was also on the grainy side. I hope someone puts together another Beach Boys DVD of the early years and improves the sound quility.,1303776000,,238,4.085106382978723
1847950,3,B00008HCB8,"The Knebworth show is the final performance of the original Beach Boys in ENGLAND.
Although, with a little research I could find the FINAL performance of the ORIGINAL Beach Boys, I know they performed LIVE and IN COLOR on July 4, 1983, the summer before Dennis died. As VERY precisely noted by Carl in ""The Beach Boys: An American Band,"" the July 4th 1983, Atlantic City show was the last Fourth of July concert featuring the original Beach Boys.  I hate this Amazon salesman crap.  I've been a fan too long to let THIS egregious appellation go by. Caveat Emptor. Read THE  book about the Beach boys--David Leaf's ""The Beach Boys,"" (aka ""The Beach Boys and the California Myth"").  Listen to the music.

Instead of hearing their fine harmony, all I heard was noise as each one tried to ""jam"" with their brash input. Don't waste your money unless you were a fan in the 60's, drug out both then and now, and are trying to relive your experience.

I might suggest the BEEGEES' One Night Only video that shows them BETTER than they were in the 70's!",1283472000,2,457,4.252873563218391

1847954,5,B00008HCB8,"I was being a little over generous giving this 5 stars.  It is not the best collection of Beach Boy hits, or the best performance by far.  However, it is the last DVD made that had all of the original Beach Boys in it and as such is worth having.  If you watch closely, you can see the dynamics of the group and the fissure fault lines that later developed.  Al Jardine had only 1 or 2 songs that were his, yet Mike Love(who I loved also) would inevitably take them over or dominate the performace, being the ""lead singer"" for the group.  Seeing the musical genius that was Brian Wilson was nice, as it was seeing the other guys.  The performance was actually a cold bleak night in Great Britain and not a breezy Hollywood night as one would expect.  Nonetheless, the guys did their best and the sound quality and video production were quite up to standard.  So, given the limited number of DVD's showing the entire Beach Boy entourage, this dvd is a must buy for the Boys' fans.",1279843200,3,979,4.34065934065934
1847955,3,B00008HCB8,"I am offering a more current view of this DVD than most other reviewers. While I watching, I actually felt embarrassed for them, because they struggled so mightily to stay in tune and keep up with one another. The vocals were awful and the guys must have been aware they had seen better days. Brian made it all happen and Mike was the glue later. I thought Brian looked really old and haggard and dazed even though he had just turned 38 the day before the concert. Dennis was in some sort of stupor and sang the worst rendition of You Are So Beautiful"" that is humanly possible. But as the end of the DVD approached, it was like seeing some older friends for the last time, warts and all....and they didn't really care even though they wanted the crowd to be happy. And that's all they can do. It's good music and  a good time. It doesn't feel quite the same watching a DVD of some over the hill guys who should probably have realized their waning talent years before. Their harmonies used to be heaven sent, and now it's a train wreck. But I'm glad I got to share their last time together in the UK. We don't discard old friends. We appreciate them for what they are and were. The play list is impressive:

Intro (Good Timin')
California Girls
Sloop John B
Darlin'
School Days
God Only Knows
Be True To Your School
Do It Again (a high point)
Little Deuce Coupe (another decent track)
Cotton Fields (slaughtered)
Heroes and Villains
Keepin The Summer Alive
Lady Lynda
Surfer Girl
Help Me Rhonda
Rock & Roll Music
I Get Around
Surfin USA (another good one)
You Are So Beautiful  (I actually thought this was a joke at first as Dennis grinded to a painful halt)
Good Vibrations
Barbara Ann
Fun, Fun, Fun

Even with all that the running time is only about 70 minutes.",1279152000,2,1764,4.401840490797546
1847956,4,B00008HCB8,"I grew up on a steady diet of Beach Boys music as a young lad. I law them live in the summer of 77 or 78. This show is vastly tighter and more representative of their talents than the night I saw them live. I realize that the band put some additional production into the audio of this DVD after the fact, but that's OK by me. Despite all of the pain and trauma going on in their various lives, they seemed to focus on putting forth a good show on this cold night in Knebworth. I am pleased to have this show to watch to remind me of just how talented these guys were before the excess of drugs, alcohol, and everything else corrupted their youthful genius. Nice to see Brian participate, even if it's only part time....
It would be great to see if any of you from the British Isles in attendance could comment on whether the show was as fun as it looked...",1278288000,,856,4.131736526946108
1847957,5,B00008HCB8,"I saw the slightly edited version of this concert on cable twice recently, with the first time having been Christmas night. It was close to midnight, so the day was almost over. What a way to bring it to an end. We were clapping, singing, and dancing along. I had the CD, but to actually see it was a completely different experience.

By 1980, these guys had been through quite a few turbulent times- squabbles inside the group, Brian's mental illness and drug abuse, Denny's drug and alcohol abuse, the departure and return of Bruce Johnston... However, you tend to not focus on any of that so much when you are listening to the music at this concert, which was the last time all six of them would perform together on stage in the UK. I was amazed by how different their sound was. Although the sunny feeling of their music was still present, there was a rough edge to it, which sounded good. For instance, ""Little Deuce Coupe"" sounded like a hard rock song. They also performed their latest song ""Keepin' The Summer Alive"". Carl Wilson, who wrote it and sang lead, was so into it, he broke one of the strings on his guitar.

You could sense some underlying tension on stage at times. During ""Surfer Girl"", you could see Mike get apprehensive when Dennis left the drums to stand next to him. The two were known for having a very volatile relationship. Carl's mind seemed to wander at times. He would take an absence from the group for about a year, starting in 1981. He wanted to go out on his own, and pursue other kinds of music. Al and Bruce seemed just happy to be there, while Mike seemed to get his biggest kick out of conversing with the audience. As for Brian, he sang a few lines of ""Surfer Girl"" and ""Sloop John B"", but he was mostly concentrating on playing piano. Denny was wild on the drums, giving it all he had. He was highly animated the entire time.

Although it was a cold and rainy night, the crowd was not fazed by it. They were having a great time. I had a great time too, watching it. The music of the Beach Boys has a way of making you get on your feet, and this concert is no exception. It is a must-have, if you are a fan like I am.",1265673600,4,2158,4.284313725490196
1847958,5,B00008HCB8,"... that tells all the inside scooby about The Beach Boys -- about their maniacal abusive father, about the squabbles between the Wilson brothers and cousin, about drugs and diagnosable mental states, about their tragedies as human beings that were so beatifically excluded from their music. I haven't read such a book, but the other reviews here on amazoon tell a lot. I skimmed over the wikipedia article on their history and felt saddened enough, not just because they've had beastly lives -- many artists have had beastly lives -- but because they've brought me so much joyous energy over decades and I can't pay any of it back to them.

Much of the dynamics of their stress can be observed during this concert in foul weather in England in 1980. By that time, the group and most of the members were in shaky shape, particularly the core composer/performer Brian Wilson, who sits slumped at his piano, a dismal detached hulk. The program of songs include some that didn't suit the group's style very aptly, and some that were obviously waaaay under-rehearsed. And yet.... there they were, rousing the crowd as always, The Beach Boys, the truest bluest musical avatars of the California Dream, Endless Summer, all the gallant loving life forces of America in the Sixties and early Seventies, before drugs and disillusionment and the anguish of the Conservative backlash. It's poignant and painful to watch this concert, but I'm grateful it's been preserved. Since I've long since lost 'that loving feeling', I might as well make do with the sullied reality.

So here's my tribute, for what it's worth, from a guy who listens to Bach and Boccherini far more than to rock 'n roll of any decade: The Beach Boys were real musicians through and through.",1263600000,2,1751,4.852842809364549

1847960,5,B00008HCB8,"There is probably no good reason for me to chime in here other than to correct a previous reviewer:  Al Jardine doesn't ask Brian Wilson if he's okay, he asks if he is in A - as in the key of A, at the beginning of a song.  Well, that's my interpretation anyway.  I'll agree Brian really doesn't seem to recognize there is even an audience, and one can see the ""Don't Panic"" signs hung in the dim background light, but Brian is pounding away at the piano and sings his parts with conviction.

In spite of the cold and wet weather, the Beach Boys warm the audience with songs of California Girls, the sun, surfing.  It's interesting to see the interaction between the band members.  I was surprised to see Dennis' compelling drumming since he looks to be in a washed-out state.  At one point he comes up front to sing harmonies alongside Mike Love.  Dennis points to his ear as if to say he can't hear, he moves up next to Mike, who rolls his eyes and rather than put his arm around him, gives him the cold shoulder.  Dennis doesn't seem bothered, and just continues doing his homeless-guy act. On another viewing, it may just be Dennis coyly playing the Surfer Girl, about whom they are singing.  But at the end of the song, very briefly you see Carl going at Mike about something, with Dennis being the peacemaker. There are many of these nuances that you might miss on first viewing, it's a good reason to watch it a few times with your remote control close at hand. Al Jardine, Carl Wilson, and Bruce Johnston seem to be the glue holding the show together, and in spite of the cold weather and family hostilities, all made the effort to come to England for this show. I rate it 5 stars not because it's the most wonderful performance I've ever seen, but because it's reasonably good and captures an important American band at a good time.  Good Timin' indeed.",1222387200,5,1862,4.415204678362573
1847961,5,B00008HCB8,"Despite how I feel about the artistic direction they took after Holland in 1973. Despite how I feel about Mike Love. This is a great show. Many other reviews have allready commented on the onstage interaction between certain members of the group and that in itself is quite entertaining to watch. But when push comes to shove if you want to sit back and watch a great concert this certainly get's the job done. Every member of the group has something to offer and it's amazing to me with how much tension there was between the band how good they could be. However after watching this one can't believe there is still a group of people out there billing itself as ""The Beach Boys"" without a single Wilson brother. This DVD shows THE REAL BEACH BOYS.Hell,I could probably put this on mute and be entertained just watching Dennis Wilson. But then again I would miss out on some beautiful music. R.I.P. Dennis and Carl.",1220054400,3,915,4.585365853658536
1847962,5,B00008HCB8,"The Beach Boys have been unfairly trivialized for their superficial, fun-in-the-sun approach to their art, but the criticism is both unfair and ironic. Behind the wave catching and gettin' around, the Wilson brothers, their cousin, Mike Love and their friends Al Jardine and, later, Bruce Johnston, could match any obviously dark band for its share of turmoil, volatility and pain. Furthermore, their music, thanks in part, but by no means completely, to brother Brian, is actually some of the most profoundly moving, innovative and relentlessly melodic material America has produced.

Okay, so there's the legend.

And here at Knebworth, we get a chance to witness the final embers of that creative fire. I was expecting less from Brian, who actually turns in an okay bridge to Surfer Girl and seems fairly in command of his keyboard. Dennis, just as I remember him, is liquid on feet and iron behind his drums. When he's up front, he's barely holding on, the apparently huge amount of alcohol and/or drugs threatening to wash him away. There's an unsettling instability to him that made me anxious, as it did when I saw him and the Beach Boys live in 1980 (without Brian). But when he's playing, he anchors the entire band, let alone himself. It's an amazing contrast. Mike's self-indulgence and dumb stage humor are less annoying, more benign than in many shows I've seen. He's also in good voice, unlike Dennis, whose vocal cords were so ravaged by abuse by then that even doing his Joe Cocker bit was beyond him. (To hear incredible Dennis singing - and writing - go back three years to his magnificent Pacific Ocean Blue.) Al and Bruce are as ever, solid and capable, while not really standing out. Bruce has no solo singing and Al just manages to hold on while the band rushes through Heroes & Villains. (The stellar, more recent performances of Heroes by Brian and his own band do the song much more justice.) And then there's Carl, who was always most moving to me in concert back in those days. God Only Knows alone would justify the purchase of this DVD. But for my all time favorite moment, let's go back to Dennis and Surfer Girl: In the front line, singing between Mike and Carl (I think) he announces the entrance of Brian's solo voice, ""And now ladies and gentlemen, Brian Wilson!"" Brian comes in with the bridge, ""We could ride the surf together..."" (Nice metaphor for the Beach Boys' journey.) As Brian takes off into these lines, the camera comes back to Dennis, thankfully, catching an indescribably precious smile that reflects a depth of pride, love and gratitude toward his older brother that cuts through everything else. It's a sublime moment.

If you're a lover of the Beach Boys, you have to have this show. If not, it's a good start, although, as I said - along with everyone else commenting on it - it's really more of an ending.",1218499200,11,2858,4.734939759036145

1847964,5,B00008HCB8,"(DVD) -  The Knebworth Show is a reminder of what a great band The Beach Boys were.  First, the classic line-up is intact bringing their energy level to a live concert that will never happen again.  Second, Dennis Wilson pounding hard on the drums drives the boys thru the surf favorites like they're new.  Third, Mike Love not over performing, sings in a most professional manner.  Fourth, the set list is perfect balencing their biggest songs with forgotten gems like ""Lady Lynda"".  Fourth, even though Brian Wilson is more of a token at this concert, it's great to see him back on stage with his band.  Fifth, finally a 70 minute action packed concert from start to finish with no interruptions.  (More Beach Boys live 1970's shows on DVD, please!)  In recent years too much has been written and discussed about regarding this group instead of focusing on what these guys created.  The documentaries - i.e.  ""Endless Harmony"", ""An American Band"", and ""The Lost Concert"" are more for historical value.  This one is different.  At Knebworth The Beach Boys are mature, could still harmonize and were a group that mattered.  I followed the band as a kid since ""Surfin' Safari"".  On this night, they matter.  This is The Beach Boys as far as I'm concerned in DVD/Video format for repeated watching.  (CD) - This release is comparable to the 1973 double concert album.  The latter had an earthy feel featuring Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar.  Knebworth is more souped up as in Rock & Roll.  Listen to the revamped ""Help Rhonda"" which goes into early jam overdrive.  This is where the beach, cars, girls and crowd hit a groove that can only be found at a Beach Boys concert.  A magical moment which some of you will understand if you ever attended one of their big shows during the ""Endless Summer"" era.  From that point on this concert simply takes off.  So what if they really did vocal studio overdubs after the fact?  The Allman Brothers, The Stones and The Who did some touch up work on their great live albums.  So did Peter Frampton.  It's the finished product that counts.  Knebworth is a feel good CD, perfect for one those dreary kind on days.",1200614400,7,2151,4.664
1847965,5,B00008HCB8,"The audio and video production qualities of this DVD are fantastic. If you are a fan of the Beach Boys and want to see Brian, Carl, Dennis, Mike and Al together for their last concert this is a definite purchase.  You will really enjoy it.",1197849600,4,239,4.311111111111111
1847966,5,B00008HCB8,"I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but I actually prefer the present-day Mike Love and Bruce Johnston combo to the 1970s Beach Boys.  True, they have no new music and true, only one original member is intact, but to be honest, I think ""Pet Sounds"" was the last good Beach Boys album.

That's why I love this DVD.  They tend to stick to their early classics during this concert, such as ""California Girls,"" ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" ""Surfin' USA,"" etc.  They don't rely heavily on their 1970s material.  I think by this time, the golden oldies tour formula was beginning to take effect, and in my view, that only makes this a better concert.  Most Beach Boys fans say that the 1972 ""In Concert"" CD is the definitive concert from the band, but very few of their early hits were presented on that one.  That's why I prefer this one.

If you want a more mature Beach Boys concert, look elsewhere.  However, if you're okay with a heavy dose of oldies, this is for you.",1185580800,4,959,4.434285714285714
1847967,3,B00008HCB8,"I was kind of disappointed with this DVD; it has some good songs, but just a few. Most of them are not good.",1176249600,3,108,3.739130434782609
1847968,4,B00008HCB8,"First off, nobody loves the Beach Boys more than I do.  I grew up with thier music.  As a musician, I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Brian Wilson for what he taught me about harmony.  I've seen dozens of their shows, some awful, some incredible.  And in 1983, a famous band I was in was their opening act for 3 weeks, so I got to hang with them and hear them every night.  Live performances are generally never quite up to par with studio performances, and as a performing musician, producer, and engineer, I understand that.  It's nearly impossible to achieve on stage amongst the roar of amplifiers and monitors what can be done in the studio where there is a totally controlled environment - and the ability to repair any mistakes.  ""Good Timin'"" is indeed a live performance, but it has been enhanced or 'sweetened' back in the recording studio before being released.  The backround harmonies have been supplemented by overdubs, if not all replaced completely.  A trained ear will hear the double-tracking of parts - commonplace in any studio recording.  It just makes everything sound ""fatter"".  This is nothing new.  The Eagles have done this on all their live recordings, as have Fleetwood Mac and plenty of other vocal groups.  Some groups, like the Bee Gees, will even run pre-recorded tracks at their live shows to recreate the lush wall of voices that characterize their studio recordings.  Personally, I like hearing the rough edges and rawness of a true live recording.  The Beach Boys made the best harmony records of anybody, so we know they can sing.  I don't mind hearing a missed part or flat note here & there.  I wish they'd just mixed ""Good Timin'"" the way it was.  The real beauty here is seeing The Boys all playing together for the very last time.",1163376000,31,1772,4.643086816720257
1847969,4,B00008HCB8,"This dvd works on two levels- If you are a casual Beach Boys fan who wants to see some aging sellouts (Mike, Carl, Bruce and Al) jigging about to the hits of their youth, buy away- that is here. On the other hand Brian is here- in body and with a couple of brief vocal cameos, and some inaudible piano. And then, there's Dennis...he ties a sweaty towel round Mikes leg, sings a BEAUTIFUL, ragged version of you are so beautiful, makes help me rhonda rock with excellent piano and backing vocals, and generally has a total blast throughout...the only spontaneous thing about the whole affair. Brian was absent from the live Beach Boys from 64 onwards, even when he was onstage...Dennis was the only reason to see them live...it's a shame he doesn't streak here!",1143590400,6,760,4.595588235294118

Get this disc and see what REAL music should sound like.  These ""aging hippies"" could play and sing rings around almost anything out there today!",1142812800,7,403,4.47945205479452

1847972,4,B00008HCB8,"After watching this DVD, I was kind of wondering which DVD many of the reviewers were watching.  First off, Dennis looked fine. He was having a blast playing drums and joking with Mike Meros through most of the concert.  Yeah, Brian looked bad, but he did back then.  Anyone who saw these guys in concert from 76 on would know Brian wasn't much of a presence on stage.  His vocals were pretty bad as well.  That was normal.  Every now and then he would surprise people, but you couldn't see a Beach Boys concert at that time and expect a lot from Brian. The rest of the guys and supporting cast did what they did, . . . they put on a good show.  Unlike concerts from a few years earlier, they had already begun shortening the show, and doing more top 40 music.  I miss the days when they would do Marcella, Long Promised Road, Funky Pretty and others in their live shows and play for 90 to 120 minutes.  Not to mention, while the vocals are great, I miss the more rock oriented shows. The stage is fairly small compared to a lot of the shows they put on in the states, so the guys tended to stand around. So Mike isn't allowed to prance like he used to do.  They all appeared in good spirits, although now and then looking like they were going through the motions.  There was not a 'fight' between Carl and Mike.  In those days, it was not unusual for these guys to bow together, and Mike missed his spot.  This is also consistent with Carl's problems with the boys lack of rehearsal time before shows. And during Surfer Girl, it's Dennis moving closer to Mike, and Mike seems a little hesitant.  First off, the rift between the two is legendary, but it also appears as though the music pushes all that aside during the shows.  Of course, Dennis was also known to play pranks on  Mike 'on stage' so Mike could be hesitant because of that. But it hardly takes away from the song, although the song is far too rushed, which again is something they began doing around 1980.

Favorite songs from this set had to be ""I Get Around,"" and ""Keepin' the Summer Alive.""

Overall, I enjoyed this, but also realized why shortly after Dennis died I stopped attending Beach Boy concerts. They were transforming into a Las Vegas act. It is interesting to see some of the little things going on, on stage, such as Carl keeping an eye on Brian; Dennis kissing Brian on the back of the head; Al asking Brian if he's okay right before, I think ""Barbara Ann."" I also wonder about the sign that Brian could read from his piano which reads: ""Don't Panic.""

Mainly I am amazed at how easy these guys made it look, but saddened that they did not take advantage of the arsenal of songs they could have played to make the show longer. These guys are legends, and we get to see elements of that, but for me, the writing was on the wall. Accept this DVD for what it is, a glimpse of what was truly an endless summer, where you can go to that nearest faraway place, and let your heart be filled with spring.",1120262400,76,2977,4.302867383512544
1847973,5,B00008HCB8,"This concert is impressing in many ways. In the first place of the music. These guys show us how popmusic has to sound with their beautifull harmonics and inventive chordchanges. Lot of their most beautifull songs are on this DvD though there is so much more.

Sad however is the tension between them. You'll see an angry Carl that wants to attack Mike Love after the last one demolishes Surfergirl by singing and winking extremely corny. Dennis just prevents him from doing so. Otherwise this concert would surely have ended in a fight between them. Brian seems far from the world so does Dennis. It's obvious that Mike Love is on stage to impress the girls and not for making music. It's a pitty that it all had to end like this, nevertheless it's not hurting the quality of the music.

I'm glad I saw Brian in The Hague (Holland) with his Band/Orchestra The Wondermints performing Beach Boys Classics but also the very impressive Smile album. It was a great event!",1093478400,7,967,4.649122807017544
1847974,5,B00008HCB8,"As a big Beach Boys fan, I found this dvd highly enjoyable. The boys from Hawthorne sound alive and well here (with the exception of Brian and Dennis Wilson, though they can be forgiven since they were battling personal demons at this point), and the overall song selection will not let you down.
""Good Timin' (Live At Knebworth England, 1980)"" is from the band's last appearance in the U. K. with the original lineup, though they obviously did know it at time. The band does plauy with a fiery edge as though it was the last time they're performing them. They sound youthful and ibrant on the rockers especially ""Help Me Rhonda"", ""I Get Around"", ""Surfin' USA"", ""Good Vibrations"", ""Barbara Ann"" and ""Fun Fun Fun"". The slow songs are a mixed bag. The best is Carl Wilson's beautiful rendition of ""God Only Knows"". Al Jardine also turns in a great reading of ""Lady Lynda"", but Brian sounds whiny on ""Surfer Girl"" and Dennis' once sparkling voice is unheard on ""You Are So Beautiful"".
Despite its flaws, this is a really great dvd. It also comes with a nice Al Jardine introduction and song commentary. Here's hoping that the four remaining Beach Boys (Al Jardine, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston and Brian Wilson) get back together soon, since the world needs them in this time of horrible music, courtesy of Britney, Christina and Eminem",1088812800,16,1330,4.737068965517241
1847975,4,B00008HCB8,"There are two words that describe this dvd: bittersweet. While it's a joyous occasion to see the band onstage again, it's sad knowing this would be one of the last times the group would be performing onstage in the UK.
There's an extremely high level of emotion on this dvd, as well as some tension. Mike Love takes over most of the show, making the rest of the group seem like a backing band. Dennis Wilson is good here but his use of drugs becomes increasingly evident with each performance. Al and Carl give the best performances. Al dlievers strong renditions of ""Cottonfields"", ""Heroes And Villains"" and ""Help Me Rhonda, and Carl's heavenly voice shines above the rest on ""God Only Knows"". Bruce Johnston remains hidden for the most of the show, but this would change later in the tour when he got his own solo spot. Brian Wilson, overweight to the nines at this point, sits perched behind a piano for most of the show, contributing a few lines on ""Sloop John B"" and ""Surfer Girl"". The main complaint I have is the sound. The band's backing vocals on ""God Only Knows"" seem to be buried in the mix. These differences aside, this makes for a very good dvd.",1075161600,17,1159,4.523809523809524
1847976,5,B00008HCB8,"Great show, not much more to say.. you'll hear almost every commercial hit of the band, including ""God only knows"", probably one of the best music compositions of the history of music. Great sound guaranteed !!",1074211200,6,210,4.861111111111111
1847977,5,B00008HCB8,"Who ever filmed this concert must have known that this was a very special show. This is one of the best concert dvds that I've seen. This concert features all 5 original members ( plus late bloomer Bruce Johnston ) performing onstage together for the last time in the U. K.
The boys were in fine form that memorable evening. The song selection is a mostly a hits - heavy set of oldies including ""California Girls"", ""I Get Around"", ""Be True To Your School"", ""Fun Fun Fun"", and particularly hot versions of ""Help Me Rhonda"" and ""Barbara Ann"". They also perform a few satisfying but not as well - received newer numbers, including the pretty ""Lady Lynda"" and a smokin' ""Keepin' The Summer Alive"". The band members themselves are top notch musically. Brian Wilson remains secluded behind the piano for the whole show, but contributes some lead vocal work on ""Sloop John B"", as well as on the heartbreaking performance of ""Surfer Girl"". The late Carl Wilson is just amazing on ""God Only Knows"", and Dennis Wilson's drumming is among his best. Unfortuneately, years of drug, cigarette and alcohol abuse seem to have caught up with him. But his voice still sounds beautiful on his lone solo number, a cover of Joe Cocker's ""You Are So Beautiful"".
This is a perfect show. Sad and joyful all at once. All the songs you enjoy plus some other, less familliar numbers. However, I did notice some lyrical differences between this dvd and the cd, particularly on ""Lady Lynda"". On the cd, the a capella part is performed as, ""Won't You Lye Lady, Sing Your Song Of Love"", while on the dvd it's ""Won't Lye Lady, Won't You Marry Me"".

1847978,5,B00008HCB8,"Thank God they got this one on film. Although my ultimate fantasy would be an entire concert from the great 1970-71 tour when the boys were traveling with a small horn section and were performing hunks of their repertoire from ""Pet Sounds"" to ""Sunflower"", this concert will more than hold me over until that dream is realized one day, hopefully. Having seen The Beach Boys more times than I can count, I had forgotten what a hard working band they were until I saw ""Live at Knebworth"". Their ability to perform ""Live"" and with fidelity the gorgeous complex songs that were the soundtrack of our lives growing up in the 60's and 70's is a joy to behold on this DVD. It was the last time all 6 original members of the band (including an obviously nervous Brian) performed together on stage and you can tell the boys are working hard this night to give their British audience a memorable concert. Some of the highlights for me were their performances of Al Jardine's ""Lady Lynda"" from the L.A. Light album and a faithfully rendered version of Brian's groundbreaking ""Good Vibrations"" (in spite of grandstanding from the allways creepy Mike Love). It's also apparent in this concert that Dennis is already starting on a downward slide that would ultimately  end in his untimely death in 1982. His ragged solo performance of ""You are so Beautiful"" is a poignant reminder that the end is not far off. Carl Wilson, one of the greatest vocalists in rock history, proves throughout this concert that he was the linchpin that held this band together until his tragic death in 1998 ended once and for all the band as a viable performing entity.

1847979,4,B00008HCB8,"Mike Love is his usual dork-on-speed self, talking over song endings, making light of certain songs, and just generally being and idiot on stage. Dennis Wilson looks completely wasted and manages to stumble through half of the bands material. (even making a mistake with a false ending on a song) Brian looks, and acts like a zombie pounding chords on the piano. (You even get to read Al's lips as he walks over to Brian to  and ask if he's okay). The DVD is really a glimps in the dysfunctional family that was the Beach Boys, and a bit surprising that it was not edited heavily to remove all this stuff. But it was not, and that's why I respect the Beach Boys a lot, they didn't try and hide their dysfunction, they wore it loud and proud because they really had no choice, but they carried on. Kudos to them. At one point duirng the show Mike Love speaks to a dazed Dennis who seems to ignore him, so Love starts to move in closer very quickly to Dennis, just then Carl grabs Love by the arm and stops him. It's all very low key, I don't want to seem to sound like they're coming close to fisticuffs on stage, but everyone knows Love is an agressive, dominating personality, as well as the shortcomings of Dennis Wilson as a professional performer being well documented, as is Mike Love's short temper and lack of tact. Al Jardine gives a terrific performance handling the vocals and rythm guitar. Carl Wilson gives a stellar performance singing and playing guitar. What does this mean?
