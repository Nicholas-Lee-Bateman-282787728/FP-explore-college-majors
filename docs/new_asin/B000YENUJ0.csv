3028198,5,B000YENUJ0,"For someone who hates working out, this is perfect.  When I get tired and can't follow his movements, I just make mine up and keep dancing.  Just moving feels so great!",1399420800,,168,4.387096774193548
3028199,5,B000YENUJ0,"This is definitely a blast from the past. I used this way back when I first starting working out as a young adult and now that I have MS I am now needing a basic easier to follow workout guide. I had loaned out my other one and never got it back so I purchased this again and even though I can't do all of the exercises, I am not intimidated my Richard Simmons because he is so nice and encouraging. This has been a tough journey for me to go from healthy to basically living in my bedroom and needing a wheelchair to go any distances larger than my own yard. I lost my career as an RN of which broke my heart. One of the bright spots in my day is listening to Richard Simmons encouraging me to do what I can and that is better than doing nothing at all. Love this video.",1399161600,2,771,3.948717948717949

3028205,5,B000YENUJ0,"It was very easy to follow along with RIchard.  Love the songs.  It made it fun, so it did not feel like working out more like dancing.",1373760000,,135,3.962962962962963
3028206,4,B000YENUJ0,Something for us older folks to try to keep up with. Some of it is still beyond a just starting out 68 year old,1372982400,,111,3.6666666666666665
3028207,5,B000YENUJ0,"Had this one way back in the days on VHS, and had to get the DVD. I have always loved Richards Sweatin to the oldies. He makes it so fun, and he always makes you laugh, and encourages you so much.",1372550400,,196,3.8048780487804876
3028208,5,B000YENUJ0,"I love to exercise and workout, but if you would like a change and still keep your shape without having time to run to the gym. This is a great video, it keeps you motivated and on track with the awesome music and up beat attitude that anyone can do it.",1370563200,,253,3.980392156862745

3028212,5,B000YENUJ0,I have had this CD for years and I use it all the time.  There are real people really working out and having fun doing it.,1361404800,,122,3.6923076923076925
3028213,3,B000YENUJ0,"In my choice and the packaging. This is not the DVD I thought I was ordering. I have a VCR version with the same title and songs, but set in a diner, using props such as a chair and soda bottles. I did the 'Diner' workout back in the 90's with my kids when they were young and we had a blast doing it. While it is still a good workout, it isn't what I expected. Does anyone know the DVD I am talking about? Do I have the name wrong?

  The packaging is pitiful. For the amount of money it cost, it would have been nice to have a real case for storage. The pressed paper case offers little to no protection for the DVD.",1356652800,2,618,3.888888888888889
3028214,5,B000YENUJ0,I needed to exercise at home after surgery and this was perfect for me.  Music from my teens and a really decent workout during my recovery and for evenings when I didn't get to the gym that day.,1354320000,,195,4.131578947368421
3028215,4,B000YENUJ0,It's not working for me right now. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new.,1353542400,,156,4.064516129032258

3028217,5,B000YENUJ0,"I'm two weeks away from turning 60, and this is the first ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" I've ever had. I have 30lbs to lose and have been pretty much inactive since a knee injury almost two years ago. To say the least, I am very out of shape. After reading many reviews of Simmons' videos, I decided on this first one of his, and I was smiling right from the start! Even though I was not able to give it the gusto like everyone in the video due to my knee, I just kept moving. It will take a couple of times to get the hang of it all, but it definitely gets your heart rate up, and it's just plain fun! Loved that there was a live band playing the songs! It was SO MUCH BETTER than what I expected, and I enjoyed the bonus interviews on this 20th anniversary dvd, too. I have gained a new respect for this man, and he has earned a new fan!",1346371200,2,834,3.940828402366864
3028218,5,B000YENUJ0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Richard. I am not very motivated when it comes to exercise but I love to dance. I've had other exercise/dance videos but they are never as entertaining as Richard and I get bored with them rather quickly. But, with Richard, I find myself sweating and smiling at the same time through the whole video! I am also not very coordinated and most videos I find are a little complicated with their dance steps, so by the time I figure out what they are doing they are on to something else already. I also have an old car accident injury to my ankle and find that a lot of videos are too high impact and leave me limping for a few days afterward. I have none of these issues with any of Richard Simmons' videos and, best of all, I am actually motivated to do them because they are so much fun and he is so entirely engaging with his bubbly personality! Who can't love Richard??",1345507200,,886,4.279761904761905
3028219,5,B000YENUJ0,"After reading conflicting reviews about the  ""Richard Simmons Sweatin to the Oldies"" videos, I wasn't sure if they would be what I needed.
Some reviewers said these routines were too easy and others said they were great. I decided to order them and give them a try.
The reviewers that thought they were too easy, must have been in pretty good shape before they tried these videos.
I couldn't get all the way through the first exercise video of the set when I did it the first time.  It took several sessions for me to be able to complete it.
The music is great, the routines are good,  and include warmup and cool down exercises and a few extra touches make the ""Richard Simmons Sweatin
to the Oldies"" a lot of fun.
I would definitely recommend them for fun exercising at home.
This 7 DVD set arrived promptly and in very good shape.",1331596800,3,833,4.431372549019608
3028220,5,B000YENUJ0,Love this video!  It makes me feel so good.... both doing the exercise AND the great music of my dancing past!!!  Doesn't seem like exercise at all!,1318118400,,148,4.444444444444445
3028221,5,B000YENUJ0,"I'm getting ready to buy a new copy of this. My first two copies were on VHS and are totally obsolete now.

I did this workout 5 days a week for 5 months and did not change my eating significantly. At the end of those 5 months I had lost 60# and lots of inches.

There is a little bit of a learning curve involved, and there are pauses between songs. Neither of those things turned out to be an issue for me. If you watch and follow as well as you can you'll soon find that you could do the routines in your sleep. As for the pauses, just keep moving. March in place, swing your arms... whatever.

This dvd won't suit everyone. I like it a lot.",1312329600,6,644,3.9767441860465116
3028222,5,B000YENUJ0,"Sweatin' to the Oldies are easy, low impact aerobics videos.  They're too easy for me and I don't work up a sweat with them.  I decided to walk on my treadmill and watch the videos.  Now I work up a sweat.  I adjust the mph to the beat of the song on the video. If it's not hard enough, I adjust the slope on the treadmill.  The songs are old 1950's songs like It's My Party, Dancing in the Street, and Great Balls of Fire.  There are eleven songs in all and it lasts about 50 minutes.  It keeps me entertained while I do an otherwise boring walk.",1303257600,4,547,4.0092592592592595
3028223,2,B000YENUJ0,This package of tapes seem to go over and over the same excersises just put to different music...very repetitious...,1284249600,2,116,5.157894736842105
3028224,5,B000YENUJ0,"I've made a lot of starts and stops in my pursuit of physical fitness. I've tried getting on a regular schedule of walking my dog, I climb the steps at work whenever I feel inspired, I occasionally park my car moderately far from my office building, and I've even considered joining a gym. I have an exercise bike in one bedroom of my house which is currently (the bike) inaccessible, and even rescued one of those little bicycle pedal leg/thigh exercisers from my deceased aunt's estate. But the one thing that has remained constant over at least 10 years is my love for Mr Simmons' ""Sweatin to the Oldies"", and this remake on DVD updates for current technology.
My loyalty is about the people on the video, who represent me in the various manifestations of my pursuit - my occasional overweight, my occasional clumsiness, my joy over moving my body - and about my groovin with the oldies but goodies. It is also about the feeling of accomplishment after only about 45 minutes of movement, and being in a lively group, just as I am, in my own living room, and about being able to run into the kitchen and stir the food in between exercises (or pausing them for just a minute). Good down-to-earth fun!",1261958400,,1201,4.564814814814815
3028225,5,B000YENUJ0,I love this workout. I know Richard is not well spoken of...but this is easy for even the ones who never exercise.,1245974400,,114,4.2272727272727275
3028226,1,B000YENUJ0,"After waiting a month for the video to arrive, I received the message that it would not be shipped.  I was very disappointed as I needed this video to practice for a talent show - our group at school had been using an old VCR tape.  We now have a very short amount of time to make other arrangements.  This was not a good Amazon experience! I also cannot a rate a product that I never received and I hope that this does not prevent my review from reaching you. Seems that I cannot submit this without a rating - so I'll choose 1 star but know that you may want to allow for this option when reviewing.",1240099200,,601,4.076271186440678

3028228,2,B000YENUJ0,"If I feel like taking it easy I'll put in this DVD, otherwise, the routines are pretty lame-o.  But great if you're more than 50 lbs. overweight since it's low impact.  Simmons is self-indulgent and seems to be doing the steps as they come to him.  We're not given any warning or heads up when he suddenly goes into the next bit.  The live band is a distraction (as good as they are) because Simmons bounces and squeals like a school girl after every song.  I just want a challenging, no-nonsense workout, please.  If you're a Richard Simmons uber fan, then this one's for you!  If not, I would try Hip Hop Abs by Beachbody.  Now THAT's a fun energetic workout with a host who's engaging, fun, instructive and...of course, great to look at.",1238716800,3,740,4.470149253731344
3028229,5,B000YENUJ0,A very pleasant transaction and everything was as described.  shipping was quick and all went very smoothly.  I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.,1238371200,,166,5.111111111111111
3028230,4,B000YENUJ0,Thanks for the speedy service.  The DVD is as promised but now I have to use it.  Thanks again.,1236729600,,95,3.9473684210526314
3028231,3,B000YENUJ0,"Got the DVD based on the running time of 90 minutes.  It actually is the first volume of the series and is only about 30  minutes long and just 10 songs.  I like the sweatin' series as an alternative to a 'real' exercise since its a lot of fun but I thought I was getting a longer workout.  (Ironically, I gave away the first volume of the series because it was too short!  Ah, well.....)",1236556800,,388,4.12
3028232,5,B000YENUJ0,"ITs everything I thought it would be, I need something to jump start me. When I was younger I kept my weight off by dancing and thought maybe this would help me jump start again. Ive don't it every day since its arrived and love it, I love that fact that not all the dancers are thin, and its shows how much they had lost at the end of the dvd.",1236211200,,344,3.859154929577465

3028234,5,B000YENUJ0,"Exercising has always seemed like work to me. With these DVD's I want to ""dance""! It really makes exercising like a party. A few of my friends are trying to shed some pounds too and one or two will come over and we can laugh, sing, sweat. and laugh together!
I really like the fact that there are all different sized people woking out. When you see how many pounds they have shed, it really makes the weight lose journey seem doable.",1235865600,,433,4.2926829268292686
3028235,5,B000YENUJ0,"Love the video, I caught on verily easy. Richard does a great job of encouraging people! Its a great addition to my work out",1235088000,,124,4.208333333333333
3028236,5,B000YENUJ0,"I would recommend Richard Simmons' dvd ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" 100% to absolutely everyone who's looking to get healthy and lose some weight.  Richard is such a character, very motivational, and he really keeps you going throughout the video.  It's extremely easy to learn and really fun!  And totally not intimidating because the people on the video are just your everyday ""average Joe"" and not supermodel-types. This is by far my favorite exercise video I've ever done and the one that keeps me coming back again and again.",1234742400,2,526,4.954545454545454
3028237,5,B000YENUJ0,"Wasn't sure I was going to like this, but I found myself enjoying the music & exercise is now FUN again!  You should buy this video if you want to exercise & it seems too much of a chore...it won't be after the first couple of songs!",1234051200,2,233,3.9574468085106385
3028238,5,B000YENUJ0,"The original ""Sweatin' to the oldies"" is still the best!! You get a great workout, by the original weight loss pioneer, Richard Simmons. Nothing works you out and gives you great motivation like this workout video. I work out to this video 5 days a week, I feel great and I get to stay in shape. Thanks as usual to Richard Simmons for helping normal, average everyday people lose weight and get in shape!!!",1233446400,,406,4.5
3028239,5,B000YENUJ0,"This is an incredible exercise video.  I love it.  I began the weight loss program and bought the DVD and 6 six weeks later, I had lost 14 pounds.  The workout is fun and I am absolutely addicted. I also bought the other Sweatin' to the Oldies and now learning #2.  Love them both and looking forward to learning #3 and 4.  The entire program is fun, easy and inexpensive.  Never has it been so easy for me to lose weight.  My deepest appreciation to Richard Simmons for these videos and the weight loss program.",1232409600,2,512,4.326315789473684
3028240,5,B000YENUJ0,"I first used this video on VHS after the birth of my first child, 8 years ago.  Yes, the hairstyles and clothing are dated, but to me, that's part of the fun!  I especially love the chick with the acid-washed, denim jumpsuit, which is actually BELTED!

Richard's enthusiasm is contagious.  He's having fun, and so are all the other people in the video.  I love the fact that they are not all buff (some extremely far from it), but are still able to do the routine and enjoy themselves.

I got the DVD for xmas, and use it on days I can't get to the gym.",1232323200,2,553,4.169811320754717
3028241,5,B000YENUJ0,"this was the best, thing i have ever brought, richard still works for me. i do this video everyday i cant afford the gym fees, so i took matters into my own hand. in the futer i plan to post  a video of how much weight i have lost... buy it,",1232064000,2,241,3.7254901960784315
3028242,5,B000YENUJ0,"My hubby bought this for me and I LOVE IT!! I own several work out videos and have tried them all BUT this one is the most fun I have ever had working out. Now, I want the rest of the set!",1231718400,,188,3.5
3028243,5,B000YENUJ0,"Hasn't lost a thing.  In the world of confusing exercise programs on TV/Cable, go back to the original.  Easy to follow, you don't feel foolish and the songs-you can remember the words to them.",1231632000,2,193,4.647058823529412
3028244,5,B000YENUJ0,The dvd arrived in first rate condition and with astonishing promptness. I have been using it and it is very enjoyable.,1231632000,,119,4.714285714285714
3028245,5,B000YENUJ0,THIS IS JUST PLAN FUN.  LISTENING TO 'IN MY DAY' MUSIC ITSELF MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.,1231459200,,83,4.1875
3028246,5,B000YENUJ0,As in many of the previous review Richard Simmons is a little hard to follow at first but in my opinion it is no harder than any other routine that you have to learn and get comfortable with.  The workout if fun and motivating because there are real people in the video.  I am already starting to see a difference in the way my cloths fit.  I suggest this to anyone who is tired of workout videos that boring and lack motivation.,1231200000,2,429,4.2073170731707314

I can see where you want the other CD'S he does as the few songs get old real fast. I will be buying the other ones soon to have variety. Great fun work out.

Though I enjoy the older music I would like to see people in newer aged clothing, newer aged backgrounds, and newer aged hair styles. This is just my personal opinion. I do sweat when using this DVD.

A lot of the moves are common aerobic moves.  I like that its mostly music with him shouting just occasionally about different moves etc.

I consider myself at the immediate level for aerobics and am using this as an add-on to other DVDs or using my eliptical machine.  Its also just fun to do on a day when you just want a light work out.  And definately good for those who are just starting to get back into shape.

Its fun and after you do it a few times, you got it down and it becomes more of an aerobic dance time that a workout.",1208217600,,697,4.036496350364963

It's not too long, keeps you moving and has a great cool down session. If you want a hard workout with lots of talking that takes at least an hour, then this isn't for you. If you need to warm up, do a low impact workout, cool down and not spend a huge amount of time on the workout, then this is perfect.  There isn't a lot of bending, which I can't do.

I also like that I can fast forward past the intro and get right to the dance. I read that some of you don't like that Richard does not give many clues.

3028281,5,B000YENUJ0,"As a busy medical student who spends most of her time in the hospital it is very easy to avoid exercise... By the end of the day I am too tired, or it is too cold outside or (insert many other excuses here).  When I decided earlier this year to try harder to exercise I asked myself what would help me stick to it.  I knew I did not want to commit to a gym (lack of time and money), I couldn't exercise outside in the winter because frankly it really is too cold.  But I could follow videos.  So I started looking at some videos.  And they were boring.  Very, very boring.

Until (while browsing),I saw a small segment on youtube of someone who recorded himself while exercising to 'Sweating to the Oldies'.  It just looked like so much fun, and the music was great.  So I decided to take a chance and to buy the video.
I am very glad I did.  I love the music!  Richard Simmons is funny and exciting and I enjoy dancing with the whole group.  The video has the following songs:
1. Dancing in the Street
2. Beyond the Sea
3. On Broadway
4. It's My Party
5. Peggy Sue
6. Great Balls of Fire,
7. Wipe Out
8. He's a Rebel
9. Personality
10. Ain't No Mountain High Enough

So, overall this was the perfect video to begin exercising with.  It is short, easy, and just pure fun!  Richard does not breakdown the movements, but I picked it up pretty fast and didn't feel it was a problem.  I loved this video so much that I am planning to buy the whole series and give this video to a friend.",1202688000,147,1483,4.097222222222222
3028282,1,B000YENUJ0,"I hoped for the best but this is my least favorite dance-exercise video and wish I had not bought it. The music is redone by a band, no songs are by the original artists and even if the music was the original, the tunes chosen do not inspire exercising. As well, after each dance, the workout stops while all the dancers clap & give thanks to the band. This doesn't help.
I realize the choice of tunes for the beginning must be meant as a warm-up, but who can get inspired to dance listening to 'On Broadway' and 'Beyond the Sea'?  Granted, there is 'Great Balls of Fire' but the choices of 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and 'Peggy Sue' just don't cut it. There are far better tunes that could have been chosen & the original artists paid for the use of those tunes. Save your money, this one is a loser.",1202688000,13,806,4.26797385620915

I bought this DVD mostly for nostalgic reasons... I am 23 years old and I remember working out with my mom and her VHS tape when I was little. I didn't realize at the time how incredibly corny the video is, but strangely that is one of my favorite things about it. Everytime I work out, I notice a funny outfit or hairdo or cheesy smile on one of the cast members that just makes me laugh... that's not something that normally happens at the gym. You will even see the cast members (and Richard) laughing throughout the video... you can tell they are having fun and that makes it more fun for you.

Though I haven't tried the sequels, Sweatin' 1 is a fairly easy (but not too easy) workout. There are a lot of arm movements... one thing that I suggest if you want to step it up is to wear wrist weights, it makes a big difference in the difficulty level.

Overall I highly recommended this both for weight loss and a good laugh. =)",1201305600,5,1038,4.206030150753769

He uses a spectrum of people as cast members, from those who are aerobics teachers to those just 'getting started.'  The routines are easy to follow, and not too strenuous for those who are trying to lose weight and get into shape.

I used this way back when I first starting working out as a young adult and now that I have MS I am now needing a basic easier to follow workout guide. I had loaned out my other one and never got it back so I purchased this again and even though I can't do all of the exercises, I am not intimidated my Richard Simmons because he is so nice and encouraging. This has been a tough journey for me to go from healthy to basically living in my bedroom and needing a wheelchair to go any distances larger than my own yard. I lost my career as an RN of which broke my heart. One of the bright spots in my day is listening to Richard Simmons encouraging me to do what I can and that is better than doing nothing at all.

I have a VCR version with the same title and songs, but set in a diner, using props such as a chair and soda bottles. I did the 'Diner' workout back in the 90's with my kids when they were young and we had a blast doing it. While it is still a good workout, it isn't what I expected. Does anyone know the DVD I am talking about? Do I have the name wrong?

  The packaging is pitiful. For the amount of money it cost, it would have been nice to have a real case for storage. The pressed paper case offers little to no protection for the DVD.",1356652800,2,618,3.888888888888889

I have 30lbs to lose and have been pretty much inactive since a knee injury almost two years ago. To say the least, I am very out of shape. After reading many reviews of Simmons' videos, I decided on this first one of his, and I was smiling right from the start! Even though I was not able to give it the gusto like everyone in the video due to my knee, I just kept moving. It will take a couple of times to get the hang of it all, but it definitely gets your heart rate up, and it's just plain fun! Loved that there was a live band playing the songs! It was SO MUCH BETTER than what I expected, and I enjoyed the bonus interviews on this 20th anniversary dvd, too.

I've had other exercise/dance videos but they are never as entertaining as Richard and I get bored with them rather quickly. But, with Richard, I find myself sweating and smiling at the same time through the whole video! I am also not very coordinated and most videos I find are a little complicated with their dance steps, so by the time I figure out what they are doing they are on to something else already. I also have an old car accident injury to my ankle and find that a lot of videos are too high impact and leave me limping for a few days afterward. I have none of these issues with any of Richard Simmons' videos and, best of all, I am actually motivated to do them because they are so much fun and he is so entirely engaging with his bubbly personality!

Some reviewers said these routines were too easy and others said they were great. I decided to order them and give them a try.
The reviewers that thought they were too easy, must have been in pretty good shape before they tried these videos.
I couldn't get all the way through the first exercise video of the set when I did it the first time.  It took several sessions for me to be able to complete it.
The music is great, the routines are good,  and include warmup and cool down exercises and a few extra touches make the ""Richard Simmons Sweatin
to the Oldies"" a lot of fun.
I would definitely recommend them for fun exercising at home.

I did this workout 5 days a week for 5 months and did not change my eating significantly. At the end of those 5 months I had lost 60# and lots of inches.

There is a little bit of a learning curve involved, and there are pauses between songs. Neither of those things turned out to be an issue for me. If you watch and follow as well as you can you'll soon find that you could do the routines in your sleep. As for the pauses, just keep moving. March in place, swing your arms... whatever.

This dvd won't suit everyone. I like it a lot.",1312329600,6,644,3.9767441860465116

I decided to walk on my treadmill and watch the videos.  Now I work up a sweat.  I adjust the mph to the beat of the song on the video. If it's not hard enough, I adjust the slope on the treadmill.  The songs are old 1950's songs like It's My Party, Dancing in the Street, and Great Balls of Fire.  There are eleven songs in all and it lasts about 50 minutes.

I've tried getting on a regular schedule of walking my dog, I climb the steps at work whenever I feel inspired, I occasionally park my car moderately far from my office building, and I've even considered joining a gym. I have an exercise bike in one bedroom of my house which is currently (the bike) inaccessible, and even rescued one of those little bicycle pedal leg/thigh exercisers from my deceased aunt's estate. But the one thing that has remained constant over at least 10 years is my love for Mr Simmons' ""Sweatin to the Oldies"", and this remake on DVD updates for current technology.
My loyalty is about the people on the video, who represent me in the various manifestations of my pursuit - my occasional overweight, my occasional clumsiness, my joy over moving my body - and about my groovin with the oldies but goodies. It is also about the feeling of accomplishment after only about 45 minutes of movement, and being in a lively group, just as I am, in my own living room, and about being able to run into the kitchen and stir the food in between exercises (or pausing them for just a minute).

We now have a very short amount of time to make other arrangements.  This was not a good Amazon experience!

Simmons is self-indulgent and seems to be doing the steps as they come to him.  We're not given any warning or heads up when he suddenly goes into the next bit.  The live band is a distraction (as good as they are) because Simmons bounces and squeals like a school girl after every song.  I just want a challenging, no-nonsense workout, please.  If you're a Richard Simmons uber fan, then this one's for you!  If not, I would try Hip Hop Abs by Beachbody.

Richard is such a character, very motivational, and he really keeps you going throughout the video.  It's extremely easy to learn and really fun!

Richard's enthusiasm is contagious.  He's having fun, and so are all the other people in the video.  I love the fact that they are not all buff (some extremely far from it), but are still able to do the routine and enjoy themselves.

If you do it all the first time your doing about 90 minutes and I was just beat and light headed the first couple times of doing this. I can see where you want the other CD'S he does as the few songs get old real fast. I will be buying the other ones soon to have variety. Great fun work out.

Though I enjoy the older music I would like to see people in newer aged clothing, newer aged backgrounds, and newer aged hair styles. This is just my personal opinion. I do sweat when using this DVD. However, I add in some extra moving around to make sure that I am sweating enough. Overall the songs are great and so is Richard, but the clothing, background, and hair styles could use some updating.",1214438400,,659,4.076923076923077

A lot of the moves are common aerobic moves.  I like that its mostly music with him shouting just occasionally about different moves etc.

I consider myself at the immediate level for aerobics and am using this as an add-on to other DVDs or using my eliptical machine.  Its also just fun to do on a day when you just want a light work out.  And definately good for those who are just starting to get back into shape.

Its fun and after you do it a few times, you got it down and it becomes more of an aerobic dance time that a workout.",1208217600,,697,4.036496350364963

I get very little exercise so I really needed something that was low impact, yet would get my heart rate up a little. I was very impressed with it. It's not too hard (I couldn't do his older ones now) yet it works up a sweat and gets the heart rate going. With my condition, I'm not able to do it everyday but it's still something I can do. It's not too long, keeps you moving and has a great cool down session. If you want a hard workout with lots of talking that takes at least an hour, then this isn't for you. If you need to warm up, do a low impact workout, cool down and not spend a huge amount of time on the workout, then this is perfect.  There isn't a lot of bending, which I can't do.  Even though I can't do it everyday, it is the only work out that I have found that I can do at all. It's also fun!",1206576000,13,875,3.8555555555555556

I do like that there are 'real' people dancing - they also make the occasional misstep, they are huffing right along with you, and so you feel right at home.  I also like that I can fast forward past the intro and get right to the dance. I read that some of you don't like that Richard does not give many clues. The steps are easy to get into and follow, and if you mess up, no big deal, you will get right back in.

3262778,5,B000YENUJ0,"As a busy medical student who spends most of her time in the hospital it is very easy to avoid exercise... By the end of the day I am too tired, or it is too cold outside or (insert many other excuses here).  When I decided earlier this year to try harder to exercise I asked myself what would help me stick to it.  I knew I did not want to commit to a gym (lack of time and money), I couldn't exercise outside in the winter because frankly it really is too cold.  But I could follow videos.  So I started looking at some videos.  And they were boring.  Very, very boring.

Until (while browsing),I saw a small segment on youtube of someone who recorded himself while exercising to 'Sweating to the Oldies'.  It just looked like so much fun, and the music was great.  So I decided to take a chance and to buy the video.
I am very glad I did.  I love the music!  Richard Simmons is funny and exciting and I enjoy dancing with the whole group.  The video has the following songs:
1. Dancing in the Street
2. Beyond the Sea
3. On Broadway
4. It's My Party
5. Peggy Sue
6. Great Balls of Fire,
7. Wipe Out
8. He's a Rebel
9. Personality
10. Ain't No Mountain High Enough

So, overall this was the perfect video to begin exercising with.  It is short, easy, and just pure fun!  Richard does not breakdown the movements, but I picked it up pretty fast and didn't feel it was a problem.  I loved this video so much that I am planning to buy the whole series and give this video to a friend.",1202688000,147,1483,4.097222222222222
3262779,1,B000YENUJ0,"I hoped for the best but this is my least favorite dance-exercise video and wish I had not bought it. The music is redone by a band, no songs are by the original artists and even if the music was the original, the tunes chosen do not inspire exercising. As well, after each dance, the workout stops while all the dancers clap & give thanks to the band. This doesn't help.
I realize the choice of tunes for the beginning must be meant as a warm-up, but who can get inspired to dance listening to 'On Broadway' and 'Beyond the Sea'?  Granted, there is 'Great Balls of Fire' but the choices of 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and 'Peggy Sue' just don't cut it. There are far better tunes that could have been chosen & the original artists paid for the use of those tunes. Save your money, this one is a loser.",1202688000,13,806,4.26797385620915

3262785,5,B000YENUJ0,"I can't explain what it is, but it takes a certain type of person to be motivational through a TV screen.

I bought this DVD mostly for nostalgic reasons... I am 23 years old and I remember working out with my mom and her VHS tape when I was little. I didn't realize at the time how incredibly corny the video is, but strangely that is one of my favorite things about it. Everytime I work out, I notice a funny outfit or hairdo or cheesy smile on one of the cast members that just makes me laugh... that's not something that normally happens at the gym. You will even see the cast members (and Richard) laughing throughout the video... you can tell they are having fun and that makes it more fun for you.

Though I haven't tried the sequels, Sweatin' 1 is a fairly easy (but not too easy) workout. There are a lot of arm movements... one thing that I suggest if you want to step it up is to wear wrist weights, it makes a big difference in the difficulty level.

Overall I highly recommended this both for weight loss and a good laugh. =)",1201305600,5,1038,4.206030150753769

The live band is great, and such a refreshing change from the recorded 'sound-alike' tracks that are so commonplace today.  He uses a spectrum of people as cast members, from those who are aerobics teachers to those just 'getting started.'  The routines are easy to follow, and not too strenuous for those who are trying to lose weight and get into shape.

The routines get progressively difficult through the series (Sweatin' 1, 2, 3, 4), so buy the whole set.  It's a great price, and will provide with you with that jump start to fitness!",1200700800,138,671,4.635593220338983
