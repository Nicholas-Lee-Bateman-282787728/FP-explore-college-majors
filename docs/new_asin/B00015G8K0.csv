8006772,5,B00015G8K0,"I owned the VHS tape for years.  But, of course, I got rid of my VHS player and my tapes.  So, I have to replace my arsenal of instructional videos.  This series is among those.

Dave explains great techniques and concepts with clarity and technical ability.  Inspiring me to go back to basics.  Excellent addition to drummers series with studying and learning the art of drumming.  I like the additional footage.  The ""interviews"" are okay.  But, these you can find on YouTube, heck this whole thing you can find on YouTube now, but having them to watch in your studio or practice room while you study is better.

Good menu system.  The only thing I think was a little cheesy is the words and fonts during the presentation.  And how they ""fly away"" across the screen.  For a modern video, definitely a dated technique in media presentation.  But, the information presented is great.  I highly recommend this video for your students, or you as an artist.",1497052800,,954,4.662650602409639
8006773,4,B00015G8K0,For my drummer son-in-law who requested it.,1483315200,,43,5.285714285714286
8006774,5,B00015G8K0,I love Dave Weckl. Dave is one of my favorite drummers. I was looking for Dave's DVD's for a long time. I was drawn to this DVD because this DVD was later on in his career. I love this  material because Dave is a lot more developed as a drummer which makes his approach more musical. This material is very enlightening and entertaining. I just recommend for Dave Weckl fans.,1427587200,2,374,4.3428571428571425
8006775,5,B00015G8K0,"To start out straight up I was at first skeptical about yet another DVD on drum technique plus in spite of Dave Weckls' immense ability and prowess as a drummer I was never a ""real"" fan. However to put me in my place and finally show some humility Dave Weckl recently toured Australia again ( I had not forced myself to attend previously) and he totally knocked me right out. Dave Weckl has become quite the virtuoso and with the passing of such greats as Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson Dave has assumed the mantel  of the current day great players, in fact he made more sense in what he played in sixteen bars compared to the others he appeared with as part of a tour of great drummers.

I recommend this DVD if your are serious about developing your technique and keeping it for a lifetime. Any drummer who understands the importance of technique to get the job done properly with an unending reserve of ability and endurance will appreciate this DVD lesson from a virtuoso drummer who will become mentioned in the same sentence as Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson and time passes. The live performances of his band as part of this production only add to the awe and excitement as you learn something from a person who can really play the drums.",1350777600,2,1241,4.486725663716814
8006776,1,B00015G8K0,"In this instructional DVD, Weckl tells the drummer/viewer to NOT play what is known as French Grip (thumbs on top). He claims that the wrist does not move that way, and that he's known people that have ended up in the hospital from this grip. He states that the German grip (palm down) is the only matched grip. This is utter nonsense, and constitutes misinformation. First off, the wrist does naturally move in a up/down motion if you hold your hand so your palm is facing to the left. If you wrist doesn't move in that direction, you need to see a doctor right away because you have an abnormality. Second, the French Grip is not based on the wrist moving up and down, it's based on the fingers and the same motion you use to open a door (see JoJo Mayer's hand DVD). Moreover, Weckl states you should only switch to this grip when using your fingers. When exactly would that be Dave? Should I constantly switch grips on the fly as the music is happening? Sounds like a recipe for failure to me. Finally, it should be noted that there are drummers that use French Grip exclusively, Bill Stewart being the most notable. Stewart has phenomenal technique and (as far as I know) hasn't ended up in the hospital. If your hands/wrists/arms hurt, it's not likely that it's your choice of grip. It's more likely that you're holding the sticks too tight, or hitting way too hard.

Weckl should release an addendum to this DVD that corrects this blatant misinformation about a very commonly used grip.",1272758400,3,1492,4.567164179104478
8006777,2,B00015G8K0,"Dave is a truly gifted drummer, but he never shows how he pulls off the complex rolls and grooves he plays, but only demonstrates how to hold and manipulate the sticks. He states that the traditional grip is better for soft delicate playing, which may be true for him, but the great Bill Stewart has no trouble playing soft delicate passages with the matched grip he always uses.

The music on this dvd and on his cd's is written and arranged to demonstrate his speed and chops with non stop cymbal accents. It lacks the feeling and emotional playing of drummers like Bill Stewart or Jack Dejohnette.  Dave needs to strip his drum kit down to the essentials and get in touch with the music again. Adding more cymbals, hi hats, and drums does nothing to enhance the music or improve the writing.
The kit he plays now must be a nightmare for his drumtech/roadie.

One can learn to develop technique much better by watching the JoJo Mayer instructional dvd.",1221955200,5,954,4.6
8006778,5,B00015G8K0,"Dave's approach to music is great, the way he managed to change his wrist/grip technique has helped me answer many of my questions. This DVD is a must have in terms of learning to play drums with less effort. He talks about seating position, drum set positioning, wrist and grip, match and traditional grips in detail, shows basic snare exercises, Moeller Technique, foot position and it has also a Freddie Gruber special appearance. Besides that, you can check out Dave's great performance with the song Tiempo de Festival which I really liked and other stage footages",1171065600,9,569,4.9375
8006779,5,B00015G8K0,"If you would like to improve your drumming technique you will love this DVD. In it Dave explains in detail wrist and finger contol, double stroke rolls and moeller techniques. He also talks about drum positioning and bass drum control. Dave's system will allow you to play with less effort taking advantage of the natural

rebound of the sticks. Highly recomended.",1108684800,31,364,4.967213114754099
