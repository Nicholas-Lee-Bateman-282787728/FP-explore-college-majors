3949250,3,B002LVVEG0,"I was a nice overview of the the history of Bigfoot in the southern states. One thing I wished to correct is that the TBRC (Texas Bigfoot Research Conservancy), despite the fact that I believe the video indicates differently, now has a, ""pro-kill"" stance regarding Bigfoot. Any discrepancy may be related to the fact that the documentary was produced several years ago, while it is my understanding that the TBRC has just altered there position recently. If true, I will no longer associate with the TBRC, or support their endeavors.",1340755200,2,533,4.933333333333334
3949251,4,B002LVVEG0,"This documentary was a treat. It featured some creatures that I had heard of (Honey Island Swamp Monster, Fouke Monster) and one I had not (Lake Worth Monster). There are interviews with experts, members of organizations that track the elusive creatures and this documentary does a good job of presenting differing points of view, such as kill vs no kill, hoaxers and why hasn't more evidence been found. It is a well rounded documentary with great narration, but short on what I most love, stories of encounters. The main documentary is about an hour long, but there is a great collection of extras, one of which is one of the scariest encounter stories I have ever heard. The southern Bigfoots are more confrontational than their northern counterparts (especially the Fouke Monster) Here is a listing of chapters:

The Main Documentary:
Bigfoot in the South (Often called variances of Wild Man, the term Bigfoot was not used until recently)
The Fouke Monster
The Lake Worth Monster
The Honey Island Swamp Monster
The Skunk Ape
Beating the Bushes for Bigfoot
The Big Question
The Big Picture

Extras:
Fouke Monster Tale
Legends of the Big Thicket Wildman
The Wallace Controversy (a famous Hoaxer)
Sounds of Bigfoot
Summer of the Lake Monster
North vs South
Texas Bigfoot Hoax
Bigfoot and Conservation
Something Lurks in Honey Island Swamp
Something's Outside the Tent - Very scary encounter tale, should have been in the main documentary-highlight of this disc for me
Pacific Northwest Investigations
Bloopers and Outtakes

While this documentary covers a broader array of topics some are mentioned, (Honey Island Swamp Monster and the Skunk Ape) I have seen more in-depth coverage in other DVDs. The Honey Island Swamp Monster has a DVD of its own and I have seen episodes of Unsolved Mysteries with more coverage of the Skunk Ape. If you really want to learn more about the sounds and habits of Bigfoot, watch the excellent Finding Bigfoot show on Animal Planet. I give this documentary four stars for a wide variety of topics and the extras. It misses one star for me because of scarcity of encounter tales. It is still an entertaining DVD for Bigfoot fans.",1330214400,8,2161,4.931318681318682
3949252,5,B002LVVEG0,"I have been intereested in the paranormal and specifically Sasquatch for a number of years. I have purchased most of the available material from Amazon, and found this to be one of the better documentaries that is available.",1328140800,4,224,4.921052631578948
3949253,4,B002LVVEG0,"I love anything regarding Sasquatch so this was a no brainer.
Someone who is new to the subject will find this show most informative, myself, it didn't teach me anything i didn't already know.",1325635200,2,192,4.676470588235294
3949254,5,B002LVVEG0,"I Laughed, I Cried, It was Better than ""Cats""....Seriously, I saw this film at the Texas Bigfoot Conference a few years ago and was blown away.  Great production, Great Flow, a truly entertaining and thoughtful film about the ""Southern Culture"" of Bigfoot. Kudos to the Director for his perspective on bringing these stories to film.",1280707200,9,333,5.054545454545455
3949255,5,B002LVVEG0,"Very informative. Living in the Florida Keys, I was most intriqued with the Florida Everglades creature, the Skunk Ape. SFB is a well done documentary on the various bigfoots of the South. Enjoyable and interesting due to the level of research behind the scenes and the film crew's ability at taking the viewer along on the excursions. I would recommend this DVD to anyone that enjoys the South with all its facts, fiction and lore about the possibility of bigfoots living among us in the wild areas of the South.",1280620800,5,513,4.711111111111111
3949256,5,B002LVVEG0,I was surprised and delighted at all the expert testimony.  This movie doesn't sensationalize the facts; Bigfoot exists.  This is the definitive movie to get to expand your understanding of this creature.  Well worth the price.,1280620800,3,227,5.25
3949257,5,B002LVVEG0,"Finally somebody has down a behing the scenes story to the cult classic ""the Legend of Boggy Creek"". The Bigfoot in the western US is over rated. This DVD will make you want to grab your camera and go out on a Bigfoot Hunt. The southern states are rich in Bigfoot history and the this DVD show just that. The DVD is well down and well researched. This is a must or any Bigfoot researcher or hunter.",1280620800,10,398,4.181818181818182
3949258,1,B002LVVEG0,I really wanted to like this doco..buts its just so tedious and boring..real shame actually..,1279324800,,93,5.266666666666667
3949259,5,B002LVVEG0,"This is really a terrific documentary, about the South's own hairy hominids, featuring such notables in the Bigfoot community as Loren Coleman, John Bindernagel, Chester Moore, Craig Woolheater, Rob Riggs, Patrick Trumble, Lee Murphy, Dr. Vaughn Bryant and author Sallie Ann Clarke. It takes a look at the different varieties of hairy hominid in the South, such as the Fouke Monster, the Lake Worth Monster, the Skunk Ape and the Honey Island Swamp Monster. It also offers theories from the different researchers and authors as to what these creatures could be. There is also a section for Extras, 45 minutes of unused footage and outtakes and bloopers. I would say get this one. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1263427200,19,701,4.899159663865547

3949271,4,B002LVVEG0,"Pretty good documentary about bigfoot. Some interesting cases and history of southern bigfoot sightings and stories. Don't let the name put you off, it is not a comedy version of a bigfoot documentary. The film contains many noted speakers and guest.",1481155200,,250,5.121951219512195
3949272,1,B002LVVEG0,A total waste of money unless you enjoy listening to people who have nothing to say.,1481068800,,84,4.3125

3949274,4,B002LVVEG0,This is a surprisingly high quality and informative documentary.  It goes into detail for four different stories concerning local monsters/sasquatch.  The Lake Worth Monster and Honey Island Swamp Monster were new to me.  The eyewitness accounts were interesting as well as the historical information.  This documentary didn't have the typical home movie feel to it.  A pretty good film.,1457395200,,387,5.491525423728813
3949275,5,B002LVVEG0,Professionally done with enough good interviews and clips to hold our interest till the very end. Enjoyed this video very much.  Educational as well as entertaining.,1444348800,,165,5.346153846153846
3949276,4,B002LVVEG0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I'd heard a lot about it and, ultimately, I enjoyed it. I wouldn't call it the best Bigfoot movie ever made (as some have) but it is an enjoyable look at the Bigfoot activity in the south that showcases the investigators on it's trail in that part of the world.",1438128000,,306,4.203389830508475
3949277,5,B002LVVEG0,"A well-produced, balanced and fascinating overview of the lore about man-like ""monsters"" in Southern states and the people who search for them. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of -- or wants an introduction to -- legendary American monsters. Great interviews with amateur field researchers, scientists, skeptics and cryptozoology experts like Loren Coleman. 5 stars.",1432944000,,377,5.631578947368421

3949279,1,B002LVVEG0,Not sure about this one I don't remember it at all so it couldn't of been too good. By the title I'm doubting it was much good.,1402272000,,127,3.740740740740741

3949281,5,B002LVVEG0,"This is a great documentary.  No-nonsense, just various interviews about the sasquatch/bigfoot reports of the southern states.  If you're into Bigfoot, you should own this.  This DVD also has some fun interviews that are not in the main documentary.  Definitely worth having.",1385683200,2,275,5.476190476190476
3949282,4,B002LVVEG0,I live in the NW so hearing about other encounters outside my area interests me.  I've seen or read about most talked about in this film but if you haven't it's worth checking out.,1368489600,,180,4.294117647058823

3949285,5,B002LVVEG0,"This is a good, comprehensive look at the bigfoot legends of the US south east. Lots of intelligent comments and interesting looks into the various legends. The skeptics and believers alike are well-spoken and come across as normal people, and not nut cases who believe every sound in the woods is a ""squatch"" (anyone who follows bigfoot shows knowns who THAT is). Much better than the one hour edited version shown on tv. I've already watched it a number of times and find something new each time. Highly recommended for bigfoot enthusiasts.",1365206400,3,542,4.9021739130434785

8373280,3,B002LVVEG0,has some of the old footage but has interviews with some new people (made in 2007) that I found interesting and especially since some of the sightings have been relatively close to where I live.  I am a chicken so I think I will continue to live in a more populated area - lol!,1485734400,,277,4.12962962962963
