8644450,4,B00IPAORL0,"SEVEN YEARS OF BAD LUCK is wonderful but the print here shows no major improvement compared with Kino's previous release of the title.

THE THREE MUST-GET-THERES is a great print fully restored.

MAX WANTS A DIVORCE is the wekeast print here, but probably no better one exists. It's a pity non other of Max's American shorts was included here, MAX IN A CAB, for example.

BE MY WIFE consists of the complete feature (against the 20 opening minutes which had been seen so far). However, it must be said that the excerpt usually shown includes footage absent from this print, and the print used on the French BLU-RAY/DVD edition of the boxed set ""Le cinma de Max Linder"" is extremely better, far superior. So, why wasn't it used as the base print for this set if it was known for years and it was used by Maude Linder in her own homage to Max decades ago?",1409011200,11,853,4.455128205128205

These films are genuine classics now that they have these great scores and have been put back to full or near full length.
BE MY WIFE and SEVEN YEARS BAD LUCK have been released previously, but they are in drastically truncated versions.
You just have to see the new footage restored to BE MY WIFE!  The dance scene had me laughing out loud!  I think I like Max's drunk more than anyone else's.  Not included here, but check out the first half of MAX IN A TAXI if you don't believe me.  There are copies to be found on the internet.

Also, do YOURSELF a favor.  Before you watch THE THREE MUST GET THERES, which is included here for the first time ever on a legitimate DVD I believe,  it is imperative that you watch the original Fairbanks 1921 version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS. It really makes this film come to life seeing the scene for scene parodies Max pulls off.  I would say that this is the BEST parody ever made but I don't think it can be appreciated without seeing the original Doug version right before watching this take off.  The Kino version has a good score and is probably the best edition at present, but this film too is easy to find on the internet since it is in the public domain.

Now we have to get a collection of Max's earlier (and later) French films.  They really deserve the same kind of restoration that the wonderful people at Flicker Alley did for Mlis and the Chaplin Keystones.
The film archives need to once again get together and start this project.
The world must to realize how important his body of work is to the history of comedy.  I'm afraid I'm making it sound like this stuff should be in a classroom or museum.
Max's films are genuine hilarious comedy masterpieces.  You will laugh!!",1402012800,10,1758,4.422360248447205
8644452,5,B00IPAORL0,"The Max Linder Collection showcases an entertainer not widely known in this country. Linder pre-dated both Chaplin and Keaton as a pioneer of screen comedy. Chaplin referred to Linder, one of the first international comedy stars, as his Professor. With his character of the elegant boulevardier, Linder stood in contrast to other comedians of this time, combining slapstick with sophisticated situational humor centered around his misadventures. Linders movie career began in France, where he starred in more than 100 comedies. Following World War I, he came to Hollywood where he continued creating his special brand of comedy.

The collection contains three of Linders American feature-length comedies, The Three Must-Get-Theres (1922), the complete version of Be My Wife (1921), and Seven Years Bad Luck 1921). Also included is the 1917 short Max Wants a Divorce. For those used to the wild, masterfully choreographed antics of Chaplin, Linder will seem more restrained  an acquired taste. Though his films are now regarded as classics, American audiences never completely warmed to them and, depressed when his career declined, he committed suicide in 1925.",1401494400,9,1161,5.4804469273743015
