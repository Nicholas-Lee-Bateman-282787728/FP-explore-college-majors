(Non spoilerific review)

Taking place in the promised land, this volume is the climax of the series and sets the stage of battle between Tera Guardians and Masagami.

Throughout the series Kuros brother has been shown to be a bad guy, an anti hero of sorts but by now you should be realising he isn't as bad as what you may think.

I would best describe this volume as a major battle, then the last few episodes are like a long sweet goodbye to the show, with everyones stories resolved, and just a few lose ends left to tie up, Kurokami waves goodbye to the viewers in such a bittersweet way.

I really enjoyed this series, the battles, the fun, adventure and the drama.

Release method aside(Bandai should of added the Japanese audio, seriously, but they didn't)

Well worth watching, and investing in this series.",1309392000,3,1014,4.594444444444444
