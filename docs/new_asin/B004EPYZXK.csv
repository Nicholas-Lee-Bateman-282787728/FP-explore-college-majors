4340933,4,B004EPYZXK,"Suppose, following the official final lunar mission of Apollo 17 in December 1972, that the once-aborted Apollo 18 mission had been taken over by the Pentagon and sent to the Moon on a highly secret mission?  That's the premise behind the 2011 film APOLLO 18, a film that is not only a conspiracy tract, but also something of an outer-space shocker a la the 1979 blockbuster ALIEN.

The premise of this pseudo-documentary sci-fi enterprise is that, under a cloak of secrecy so great that apparently not even the same American media that uncovered the truth of Watergate knows about, the Department of Defense sent a three-man crew to the Moon on Apollo 18 in December 1974 on an errand that the crew clearly knew nothing about beforehand.  Everything seems to go well at first; the two men (Warren Christie; Lloyd Owen) who land on the Moon in the lunar module ""Liberty"" make their landing as routine as anything we saw during the real Apollo program (with the exception, of course, of the Apollo 13 mission of 1970, which almost took a fatal turn).  But once they get there, they discover what would appear to be an actual Russian lunar module a mere three miles from their landing site; and when they enter the module, they see the interior is in a shambles, with blood over the control panels, and a couple of very dead Russian cosmonauts.  Even more, Own and Christie discover tracks made on the Moon's surface that are neither theirs nor those of the cosmonauts--indicating, of course, extra-terrestrial life (a premise that defies a lot of scientific credibility since, at least during the actual Apollo missions, no evidence of such a thing was ever found on the Moon's airless surface).  But then the extra-terrestrial creatures, which look like mini-crabs, appear out of the lunar rocks, and then....

Basically a combination of various conspiracy-type sci-fi films (e.g. HANGAR 18, CAPRICORN ONE) , legitimate sci-fi (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY; ALIEN), docudrama (APOLLO 13), and ""found horror footage"" (THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT), APOLLO 18  was largely financed by the very independent brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein for what was an extremely paltry amount, $5 million.  Given its attempts at BLAIR WITCH-style tactics (shaky cameras; grainy video; strobe lights) and working with technology that existed back in the mid-1970s, the makers of APOLLO 18 have sought to exploit that market of so-called ""found film"" footage that popped up after BLAIR WITCH's sudden and huge success in 1999.  The finished product has many of the same flaws and high points of BLAIR WITCH; the acting by the three principal actors cannot be expected to be on the level of Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, or Bill Paxton in APOLLO 13.  And it certainly has too many credibility gaps to either be as enlightening as ""2001"" or as scary as ALIEN, though, strangely, the brief moments when the lethal crab-like creatures do appear in person (mostly, they are implied) give off a shock factor not far removed from THE BIRDS or JAWS, which is far better than most horror films of recent vintage have managed to do.

Not surprisingly, both NASA and the Pentagon disavowed giving the makers of APOLLO 18 any help in its making, and it's just as well.  This movie is no masterpiece by any reasonable definition of the term, even given a budget that, by today's sci-fi standards, is very low indeed.  As an experiment in combining conspiracy theories, pseudo-documentary techniques, legitimate sci-fi, and horror, however, it does succeed in certain ways that very few others of its type ever dreamed of.",1315440000,64,3573,4.923460898502496
4340934,3,B004EPYZXK,"Okay, just got back from the movies after watching this film.
Its the usual found footage film so if you like this genre I am sure you will enjoy the film.
Yes it could have been a lot better in many places, but if you like the trailer there is a good chance you will like the film.",1315267200,,282,3.8793103448275863
4340935,3,B004EPYZXK,"The plot for this tedious film is simple enough: Apollo 17 is the last reported mission to the moon, but Apollo 18 actually happened clandestinely, under a Department of Defense emblazoned conspiracy umbrella.  The movie displays the ""found footage.""

First and foremost, I hated the filming techniques.  I get what they were attempting, but I wanted to hurt someone when it was finished.  Far too much choppy, shaky, grainy footage that jumped around like the camera was in a 10-foot blender.  The discontinuity between cuts reminded me of a security camera at the mall.  While it added an authentic feel to everything, it also distracted significantly.  The action is never seen.  The movement is cursory.  Then there's the great reveal that barely happened.  Implausible or not, the antagonist of a film needs to eventually be revealed and placed on display.  Otherwise the buildup is all for naught.  Imagine Jaws where all you see is the fin the entire movie.  At a certain point we need to see more than subliminal evil.

The positives of this film are minimal.  The actors played the All-American, big man on campus role pretty well.  For NASA cream of the crop they were believable.  Sets were cramped, claustrophobic, and space-age, exactly what a space neophyte expects.  It's clear that the hall pass given by NASA was liberally used to cull source material for realistic set pieces and ideas.  A few jump scares are thrown in, but the timing may as well have been on a zoetrope they were so predictable.  Beyond that, there isn't much to like.

The morose ending not only fills conspiracy theorists tin foil caps, but leaves a massive plot-hole that needs a backhoe to cover up.  Once you watch the film - if you want to waste money - you'll be asking why Apollo 18 ever occurred.  I'm not only talking about the mission in the film, but the film itself.",1315180800,10,1866,4.7625
4340936,1,B004EPYZXK,"SPOILER ALERT - SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (you have been warned)

I really wanted to like this movie.  I like sci-fi and I like the occasional scary movie so even seeing that it was not getting good press I decided to chance it.

First off, this is one of those shaky-cam films and that just isn't a good gimmick.  The premise is that this is recovered footage, blah blah blah, but it is just a film style that is unpleasant for me, even when it is done well (and this is not well done).  There is a lot of blurred video that cuts abruptly and makes it hard to watch.  In addition, the audio doesn't match what you are seeing.  Sure, when someone talks the audio syncs up perfectly, but other times the audio track carries on and on all the time with radio messages while the videos are cutting and jumping all over the place.  If the video is cutting then the audio should as well.  And it does cut (complete with ear-numbing pops, squeals and blasts of static) but it doesn't do it at the same time the video does.  So not only is it shaky cam but the audio doesn't help matters any.  It is not a long movie but it is tiring to watch.

The movie starts out well enough and builds up the tension steadily but then near the end it just jumps into fast forward and ten minutes later you are done.  Watching it feels like a lot of work for very little payoff.  Almost as if they spent all their energy just setting up the introduction and then just slammed out an ending as soon as they could.

The ending (and really the whole plot) is just not that good.  This is one of those movies that gives you only a brief glimpse of menace and then never really has it materialize into something you can understand or appreciate.  It felt almost like they understood how implausible it all was and so they didn't offer you anything substantial as a way to avoid having you tear holes into it - and boy, you can really tear holes in this movie.

The whole premise (SPOILERS!!!) is that certain rocks on the moon ""feel odd"" and then sprout legs and attack you when you are about to escape.  The Department of Defense, with an unspecified level of help from the Russians, know something is up there killing cosmonauts and so someone at NASA or DOD or something figures they should send some more fresh meat up there without giving them any warning and only the most basic of instructions (""hey you, set up these motion cameras in case some Russians happen to walk in front of them"").  Not sure what the goal there would be because if they knew there was something up there it would seem like they would want to have a well-informed and well-trained crew to get the most info possible but then you wouldn't have an Apollo 18 movie so...",1315180800,16,2716,4.309055118110236
4340937,1,B004EPYZXK,"Terribly boring movie with bad, black and white, choppy footage.  The story is a bit ridiculous, blood thirsty creatures on the moon.  It seemed like another zombie movie, basically.  They could easily just call this movie Quarantine 3 and get away with it.

It might have been better if they didn't try to make this a ""found footage"" movie.  Watching bad quality, black and white, choppy scenes wasn't pleasant and it takes down my rating quite a bit.",1315094400,11,452,4.743589743589744
4340938,5,B004EPYZXK,"""Apollo 18"" is great! This is how the story goes: Officially, Apollo 17, launched December 17th, 1972 was the last manned mission to the moon. But a year later, in December of 1973, two American astronauts were sent on a secret mission to the moon funded by the US Department of Defense. What you are about to see is the actual footage which the astronauts captured on that mission. While NASA denies its authenticity, others say it's the real reason we''ve never gone back to the moon.

The cast is good. The directing by Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego is great. The story & screenplay by Brian Miller is great. The cinematography by Jose David Montero is great. The film editing by Patrick Lussier is great. The casting by Johanna Ray is great. The production design by Andrew Neskoromny is great. The art direction by Tyler Bishop Harron is great. The set decoration by Ugo Serrano is great. The costume design by Cynthia Ann Summers is great. The make-up effects design by Gary J. Tunnicliffe is great.

This is a great suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat while your heart is racing and your mind thinking. This is another great found footage movie that keeps you entertained and at times, interested. This, like, ""The Blair Witch Project"" and all the others, are well-made stories that make you, again, think.",1315094400,12,1327,4.740259740259741
4340939,3,B004EPYZXK,"Here we have another ""found footage"" movie which does nothing to expand or explore the genre. This is a shame as there are some aspects of this that are genuinely good, but, at the end of the day, it fails.

Here's the scoop. An Apollo mission is sent to the moon at the behest of the D.O.D. Getting there is fine but upon their arrival they find the Russians had already been there and something obviously went wrong. Before long things start going wrong for them as well.

This is actually directed quite well. The mixture of film and video footage does give the viewer the feeling of being there with the crew. The sets are good. I felt as though I were on the moon and in the landing module. The acting was real tasty as well. All three of the primary players gave very natural, compelling performances. The scares, however, were cheap. They were almost all of the ""jump"" variety. There were a few things that were scary/creepy but not enough. That is a shame because, given the premise, this could have driven the creepy dial to 11.

The problem comes in at the script level. The writers tried to be subtle in the way the various plot points were introduced but, at the end, I was confused. What was the point of the mission? This is difficult to write about so as not to introduce spoilers, but, were these guys merely bait? How much did the D.O.D. know before they introduced the mission? Some of the script pointed in the direction of us checking out if the Russians had, in fact, gone there. Other plot points pointed indicated that the D.O.D. knew what these guys would find when they got there. If that's the case, then what was the point?

This didn't hurt to watch by any means but I felt as though my time would have been better spent elsewhere.",1315008000,4,1759,4.419753086419753
4340940,1,B004EPYZXK,"There are enjoyable bad movies that make you laugh and then there are bad movies that make you curse for wasting your hard earned money. Apollo 18 is the latter. The premise is that moon rocks are deadly aliens waiting to turn you into blood dripping guys with blood shot eyes! I guess whoever wrote the screenplay of this godforsaken movies couldn't quite make up their minds: zombies or hemorrhagic plague victims who miraculously no longer need air. Next off there is zero atmosphere on the moon. Sorry there is no life. If there was any life at one time it was sterilized by the sun's radiation billions of years ago. If there is any life, it would be microbial and it would have a hard time knocking over flags and tipping over land rovers! Next the government has sent four previous Apollo missions to the moon. By that time if something kinky is going on do you think they would send three of the most highly (and expensively) trained men on earth to certain death just to set up a bunch of monitoring cameras? Please! A simple quarantine would do! The aliens don't have factories building rocket ships! And if the moon rocks are so dangerous, what are the astronauts doing bring MORE back to earth? Duh? Sorry, tea-party fantasies aside, even the U.S. government is not that moronic.

This is a depressing and boring film that leaves you feeling empty when you leave the theater. The only reason I sat through it was because I was hoping with all my heart that something unpredictable would happen. It's never a good sign that about half through the movie you know exactly how it's going to end. I'm a sucker for science fiction but this is the last straw! I've learned my lesson and I'm going to read the reviews carefully next time!",1314921600,12,1742,4.565495207667731
4340941,3,B004EPYZXK,"""Found footage"" horror films are a dime a dozen these days, having started to wear out their welcome, from ""The Blair Witch Project"" to ""Cloverfield"" to ""Paranormal Activity"", one can't help but feel that ""Apollo 18"" falls into the trap of trying to ride on the coattails of those who came before, and at a time where the genre seems to be wearing itself thin.  Thankfully however, ""Apollo 18"" manages to distinguish itself enough to stand on it's own legs, and deliver a satisfying experience.

""Apollo 18"" follows the tale of the final, top-secret mission to the moon.  Assembled from top-secret footage taken during the mission itself, we follow the three astronauts as they head to the moon to put up several audio recorders, so the good old US of A can get an edge on those pesky commies in Russia.  However, shortly after landing, they make a shocking discovery and realize that their mission has become incredibly dangerous.

There's a lot that can't be said about ""Apollo 18"" without giving away some nice surprises, but I can say this:  ""Apollo 18"" has the advantage of multiple camera angles and intimacy going for it.  Unlike similar films, the action here is filmed from multiple angles (mounted cameras in the spaceship, hand held, cameras on suits, etc.), so that we constantly have new things to look at, rather then shaky footage shot from a single camera.  I also really enjoyed the sense of loneliness that the movie creates:  We never leave the three astronauts, and as the film goes on, the tension and dread really build, and culminates in a very memorable climax.

For all that it gets right, there are a few areas where ""Apollo 18"" stumbles:  For one thing, it's not all that scary.  Creepy yes, and with a great atmosphere of dread, but there are few outright scares (though the scenes with a strobe light are REALLY well done).  The main characters also are fairly generic (the all around nice guy, the chipper pilot, the determined commander), but because there are only three of them, we're still interested in what happens to them, so that can be forgiven.

All in all, ""Apollo 18"" manages to carve it's own unique identity in the found footage genre.  Despite the lack of genuine terror, it's sense of isolation and dread goes a long way to creating a very effective atmosphere.  While it probably won't win any awards or revolutionize the genre, ""Apollo 18"" is still a memorable, enjoyable film, and is easily recommended.",1314921600,179,2452,4.774881516587678
4340942,3,B004EPYZXK,"Was Apollo 17 the last manned lunar project?  Not if you believe the underlying premise of Apollo 18.  I just returned from the theater and talk about a split personality of a movie.

Why haven't we been back to the moon?  Because there is life there....and not necessarily friendly live either.  That much is given away in the trailers.  The problem comes in the Blair Witch Project way the film was shot.  Over done at this point for a method of filming a movie.  But that's not even the main problem.  There is also an X-Files element to Apollo 18.  Government ""conspiracy"" raises its ugly head in this movie.  I found that to be a bit insulting as a movie goer.  Leave that element out and you have a winner story.

Don't get me wrong.  There are quite a few moments that will make you jump in your seat.  The movie also does a good job at delivering a sense of despair and isolation that the main characters must feel in their situation.  Their excitement at landing on the moon gradually turns to fright as the realization of their true situation becomes apparent.  Good job on this front.

This could have been an above average flic had the producers/writers avoided the DOD conspiracy aspect.  If you haven't seen Apollo 18 yet see if you don't agree with me after you do.

Three stars is all I can give on Apollo 18.",1314921600,3,1325,4.419087136929461

4341164,3,B004EPYZXK,"I watched the movie, and while it's premise is interesting, it's not really believable after you take some things into consideration.

1. The orbiting module and landing craft collide in the end, killing the astronauts. So how did the footage get back to earth? True you can stream digital video but this movie was set in 1974, before digital streaming. And video back then was shot on 8mm or 16mm tape, which cannot be streamed, only digitized. True, audio recordings could have been sent back by radio transmissions, but we are seeing clear video tape in the movie.

2. The gravity. The astronauts, when not buckled in, are sitting or standing in the lunar module or the rover and not floating around, nor or any of the loose equipment or moon rocks brought on board. This is the most obvious problem in believability. The moon's gravity is about 13% of earth's. The astronauts would have had to weigh more than 2000 earth lbs( or about the weights of the spacecraft used) to not float around on the moon.

3. The aliens. They are disguised as moon rocks. This is not unconvincing; many earth insects camoflauge themselves to act as predators or hide from them. But the aliens supposedly exist in a vacuum, since the Moon has no real atmosphere. True, some rare microbes can exist in hard vacuum. Manned space missions have shown this. They're called extremophiles. But even these show no movement or biological function in the vacuum; they basically go into stasis. And even if an vacuum-surviving extra terrestrial alien does exist, it's morphology would be so different from earth species' that it would pose no biological threat at all.

So the movie is cool from a sci-fi perspective, a little under done, but still worth watching if you like sci-fi or horror movies.",1487116800,,1774,4.787581699346405

4341319,4,B004EPYZXK,"First off, please note that I'm writing from my personal experience as an Apollo program historian and a planetary science major, so my view of the film might be different than the average viewer.

The sets and props in this film are top notch reproductions, and are truly some of the best recreations ever done for an Apollo based film (They were done by the company that did Tom Hank's ""From the Earth to the Moon"").  [SPOILER:  ************>>>>  The same goes for scenes involving Russian lunar hardware ]  They are the high point of the film and fun to see if you are a space buff.

As an alleged ""found footage"" film (trust me, it's not real as some think, particularly because the copyright disclaimer calls the characters fictitious), the filming style brilliantly mimicked the actual TV transmissions from the lunar rover and inside the lunar module.  That style, coupled with the great costumes and sets, really made it seem like 1970s ""lost"" Apollo footage, and pulled off a believable found-footage look.

The story starts out strong but gets progressively weaker however, and the ending is definitely a disappointment.  I don't want to give too much away, but the alien life the astronauts encounter and the way it attacks them is silly and implausible.  So why do I give it 4 stars?

As an Apollo fanatic it teases us with a taste of what a truly great fictional moon landing movie could be if it has great production values AND a good story.  This only had half of that (good production values), but the story was good enough to keep me entertained as I enjoyed the visuals.  As a space buff that made it a treat to watch.

Additionally, the DVD extras were nice for what some consider a B-movie.  Alternate scenes and endings were included, and a nice director's commentary.  The alternate scenes with the Russian lander were especially cool.

So long story short, it's a decent popcorn film and a nice way to pass the evening, but it's not the great Sci-Fi horror film that ""Aliens"" was.  But I do think it's worth watching at least once.",1472601600,,2054,4.674094707520891

I don't mind low-budget films if intelligently made, but the filmmakers evidently didn't bother to even do basic research on the era in which the story is set.
For one thing, the slang in the dialogue is completely wrong for the times.  Grown men did not call each other dude in the 1970s.  There are so many similar verbal anachronisms throughout the film, I could barely stand to listen to it.
Even the haircuts are all wrong.  Forty years ago, men who chose to wear very short hair wore real crew-cuts, which is a very specific style (think H.R. Haldeman).  The actors in this film are  wearing variations of the modern shaved-head look, which didn't start to become popular until the 90s.

4341693,2,B004EPYZXK,"Apollo 18 is another of the Blair Witch style films that purports to use actual uncovered footage but that hook only serves to undermine the plot.  The premise is that the officially canceled Apollo 18 mission was actually launched in December 1974 but never returned, and as a result the United States has never launched another expedition to the Moon.  The mission is headed by the Department of Defense who keeps it a secret.  Even the Astronauts families believe they are simply in training missions.  The Astronauts, Captain Ben Anderson, Commander Nate Walker, and Lieutenant Colonel John Grey are told they are going to install cameras and other security items to detect possible Soviet ICBMs.

Anderson and Walker land on the surface but soon begin to hear strange sounds from outside their lander and experience interference in communicating with NASA.  While exploring they come upon a Soviet lunar lander and a dead Cosmonaut.  They are told by Mission Command to continue their work but as they try to depart the Moon, but something damages the craft and leaves behind inhuman trackssigns of possible extraterrestrial life!  Unable to contact Houston Control or Grey in the orbiter, the pair begin to suspect they were used by the DOD to confirm the existence of alien life and that their own lives are considered expendable.

This is a film that would have worked much better as a straight Sci-Fi horror rather than being done in the overused mockumentary style.  I mean we really cant buy the original premise anyway so whats the point of doing it as an actual footage film?  Secondly, this ties them into having everything be murky and grainy and whats more, why would they be filming themselves sleeping in the lander anyway?  The idea that their might be primitive life on the moon is interesting even if it is impossible since theres no atmosphere but that possibility is tossed aside in preference to the conspiracy angle.

Theres some good scenes in Apollo 18, and actual Apollo footage mixed in helps give the film an authentic look, but its a case of a good premise and a missed opportunity.",1438387200,,2113,4.868715083798882

I also enjoyed the plot as long as you overlook the conspiracy theory. I found it highly believable and the actions of the cast don't suffer from classic horror stupid move problems. Such as going into the killers graveyard instead of running towards town.

Unfortunately this is where the praise ends, while there was done tense moments i found most of them to be flat. The shaky cam was a little too authentic as some tape appears to be damaged. This made me try and squint to see the scares and took me out of the experience. There was a part where the scare is literally highlighted because it was so hard to see against the background.

Also the movie ends 10 minutes early, they stretched the normal wrap so they could make it to 90 minutes.

4341901,1,B004EPYZXK,"I am so glad that I didn't pay money to see this, but rather borrowed it from the library at no cost, save wasted time.
It has been promoted as a ""found footage"" film that does not use actors.  So why does it have a cast list of every actor and actress in the thing?  Partial listing:  ""Warren Christie as Lunar Module Pilot Captain Benjamin ""Ben"" Anderson, Lloyd Owen as Commander Nathan ""Nate"" Walker, Ryan Robbins as Command Module Pilot Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, Andrew Airlie as Mission Control, Michael Kopsa as Deputy Secretary of Defense.
The cinematography is garbage; with jerky filming, digitally faked film distortion and choppy editing throughout.  The intention is to make it appear like the whole thing was pieced together from top secret footage.  It succeeded in making the viewing annoying, as opposed to realistic.
Get this:  Dimension Films head Bob Weinstein balked at the idea that the film was a work of fiction, stating that We didn't shoot anything; we found it. Found, baby!  Found in the rubbish can of a Jr. High film class, morelike.
The following is a quote from imdb, which I really wish I'd read before checking this thing out:  ""The only 'real' aspect is that some archival footage from NASA of previous Apollo missions is used in a few sequences. Also, at the end of the credits it has a disclaimer.""

Spoiler Alert:
Some of the stupider moments:

Early on, astronaut picks up what is supposed to be a moon rock with thick space gloves on, and says it feels ""strange.""
We have the painfully old cliche' of when the astronaut is breached by the moonrock/crabthing, it starts to control his mind.  ""You said there was something in your helmet!""  ""No, I don't remember that at all.""
Obviously, the fellow in charge of story continuity was out partying when it was time to reconcile the crab-like creatures leaving footprints like shoes with no sole.
I suppose it was supposed to seem scary, rather than dumb when all the rocks which were in the astronaut's NASA bag were suddenly floating free in the russian lunar module and changed into crab creatures.
When moving around on the moon, the astronauts do not appear to be affected by the lighter gravity. They walk normally, even shuffling their feet at times, except in the stock footage from actual astronauts.
When the two astronauts are driving the Rover, trying to find back the Russian capsule, the skyline of a city can be seen in the background for a few seconds, revealing that the scene was shot on Earth, rather than the Moon.  This movie stands as a haunting expose of NASA's last (and secret) trip to Vancouver, British Colombia.",1415232000,,2627,4.747252747252747

I hate the Blair Witch Project, and I assume that Paranormal Activity has made money only because the current generation of young Americans has no appreciation for movies that actually bother to have character and story.  That being said I did not expect much from Apollo 18, but I am pleased to report that the film is taught, filled with mystery and suspense, and has an actually really creative premise.

Three astronauts go to the moon, they find ""something"", hijinks ensue.  That more or less sums up the entire plot of a film that comes in at just about an hour and twenty minutes long.  However the events in the lunar lander, on the lunar surface, and in the capsule really pulls the viewer in and makes them feel the claustrophobia and sense of helplessness that our heroes must be feeling.  While this film has been compared to other found footage films of the last 10+ years I think I disagree with those who argue that it is a knock off of other films.  In all of those other films our main characters could have gone ANYWHERE.  They could have left the house, run away from the danger, get out of the city, leave the forest.  But these guys are on the moon.  Where can they really go?

The film does have some cliches: ""You knew something was up here and you sent us anyway!""  ""There is something inside of you.  I can't let you in because you could infect us all.""  ""We can't let you come home because you might be infected...""  But the film makes up for all of this with the fact that it does not overly rely on the generic jump scares and character stereotypes so common today.

I would say more but that would give things away.  I highly recommend this title to anyone in the mood for a good scifi horror film.  If you have seen ""Alien"" then you know the drill here, but they do a good job keeping the formula fresh.",1387756800,,1851,4.378299120234604

The three astronauts could tell no one about the mission  not even their families.  Unfortunately, shortly after making a successful lunar landfall, the astronauts discover that they aren't alone up there  and that the government already knew about it.  The best of Americas best reached the pinnacle of their dreams, only to find out they were nothing more than expendable guinea pigs for a circle of lying government officials.  For me, Apollo 18 represents the ultimate found footage concept.  Were talking about a secret lunar mission here, and that pretty much trumps any concept involving teenagers falling victim to some unknown force out in the middle of the woods.  It just doesnt get any more isolated than sitting on the moon without any comm signal to Earth or even to the lunar orbiter.  I cant say that this movie met all of my lofty expectations  but it does represent a pretty darn good and certainly entertaining attempt.

As the story goes, everything about this mission was indeed secret  until recently, when someone uploaded dozens of hours of footage to a website called lunartruth.com.  This movie, we are told, comes out of that extraordinary footage.  The filmmakers do a good job in terms of special effects, making the various pieces of footage look as if they came from different quality cameras.  You don't see these guys bounding across the barren tundra because of the reduced gravity, but that would have been difficult to recreate  especially in those bulky vintage spacesuits  anywhere but the surface of the moon itself.  The astronauts are fairly stoic, as well  certainly much less so than some of the real Apollo astronauts were.  Theyre committed to the mission, though, installing the DOD scanners and cameras and searching around the area.  That all changes when they find someone elses footprints in the sand.  Those tracks lead them to some rather extraordinary discoveries.  They demand answers from the guys back on Earth, but few are forthcoming  and then they lose all communications whatsoever.  The only thing they do know is that people from the DOD  and presumably at least some of their NASA bosses  knew what they would encounter but didn't share any of that information with them.

The movie isn't all that scary or creepy, but theres plenty of mystery and suspense on hand once things begin to fall apart.  The acting is superb, which contributes to the sense of realism the film holds throughout its running time.  In the end, while the story may be pure science fiction, its all too easy to believe that the government would actually do something like this.",1387411200,4,2966,4.8562874251497

4342211,2,B004EPYZXK,"Apollo 18 (Gonzalo Lpez-Gallego, 2011)

I had somehow missed, or forgotten, that Apollo 18 is yet another shakycam-found-footage mockumentary, but even after realizing that, I kept watching anyway. I don't hate those movies perhaps as much as I should, especially given that I am prone to motion sickness. And for most of its length, Apollo 18 is a run-of-the-mill found-footage horror film, nothing special, nothing great. Then you get to the end of the movie, and if you have any shred of suspended disbelief left, you will start throwing things at the screen and demanding your money back. Even if it's your TV screen and you pay eight bucks a month for Netflix and you watch enough movies that you actually paid all of about three cents to watch this.

Plot: There were officially seventeen Apollo missions. Supposedly, Apollo 18 posits, there was in fact an eighteenth Apollo mission in 1974. (Never mind that shakycams in 1974 would have been a bit larger than shakycams today.) Ben Anderson (This Means War's Warren Christie), Nate Walker (Miss Potter's Lloyd Owen), and John Grey (Passengers' Ryan Robbins) were the personnel; Grey staying in orbit around the moon, while Anderson and Walker touched down ostensibly to deliver some sort of listening equipment. When they get to the surface, however, they discover that it's possible what they were told they were sent to do and what they were actually sent to do are two very different things...

All well and good, and it is certainly the case that any number of found-footage movies, including The Blair Witch Project, have devised mind-stretching how this footage got out to the public backstories for the footage finally making it to the public, Brian Miller, the guy behind Apollo 18, didn't even try; if you don't get to the end of this movie and ask yourself where that particular piece of the puzzle disappeared to, you're way better at suspending disbelief than I am. For that matter, things get silly about half an hour before that, but this is a horror movie, you have to expect that sort of thing. And until then, if you can shunt aside the fact that this is for the most part the plot of an old X-Files episode (telling you which would give the game away, and to be fair to the movie I didn't realize this until a couple of days after I'd finished the movie), it's decently-acted if not great, it draws on the time period it's set in as part of constructing the mystery at the heart of the film, and the creepies are effective and not overuseda rarity in this sort of film. I wish I could tell you it's Frost/Nixon meets The Blair Witch Project! and, had this gone through another rewrite or two with an eye towards believability and continuity, it might have been. Unfortunately, it's not, so you're stuck with the skeleton of what might have been and a not-too-terrible first act. **",1385769600,,2856,4.730923694779117

It does a good job projecting onto the audience the isolation and fear of the cast.

Best of all, it does not suffer from the shakey camcorder footage and can litterally be nausea inducing.

I thought it would be a fun watch, and it was okay, but got a little boring there just about halfway through. It couldn't keep my attention. Though there were a few good scare moments and interesting developments, as the action picked up the suspense and impact dwindled.

Early on the film seemed cool, but the magic was lost. I suspect the home movie footage is supposed to build our concern for the characters, help us connect emotionally so there may be greater impact when the horrors unfold later. I didn't feel it.

Good premise but I think the potential fell short due to poor direction, okay acting, and excessive focus on faux camera effects, which were over-done and unconvincing. Home movie cameras did not have zoom lenses, by the way.

I gave it three stars because I thought the actors were a good fit for their rolls, and the space footage was pretty cool. I've seen worse films, but I've seen a lot better too.

4342321,2,B004EPYZXK,"Apollo 18 surprised me in theaters. It uses a found footage format to make this into a pseudo space documentary/horror film. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dimension Films head Bob Weinstein ""balked at the idea"" that the film was a work of fiction, stating that ""We didn't shoot anything; we found it. Found, baby!"" The production comes across as very amateur as a result which is hard to swallow because most of us don't bring handheld cameras to the moon. The Blair Witch Project is more convincing because the low-budget props and acting worked in the forest but doesn't work in space. When I saw Blair Witch I could deal with the premise because that movie doesn't ask the audience for too much but it is so obvious that this is not the ""lost footage"" from the Apollo 18 mission in 1974 that the whole idea comes across as cheesy. Even Paranormal Activity seems more ""real"" and offers some decent jump scares. This film is suspense-free and not scary at all. The props look like Radio Shack quality. It is apparent the actors are pushing buttons on a children's toy when it is supposed to be a computer worthy of a space flight (however antiquated the technology might seem to us now). The filmmakers tried to capitalize on the theme, popularity and dialogue from the excellent Apollo 13. If I hear, ""the LEM, the LEM, we have to get back to the LEM"" one more time I will scream in a place no one can hear me. Admittedly, the Blu-ray picture and audio quality are fairly good. There is 25 minutes of total bonus content. You also get a DVD and digital copy in this release. Skip this and buy Apollo 13, Alien or Event Horizon instead, which are all excellent space films (though Apollo 13 is obviously not horror). Amazon reviewers rate this a lowly 2.5 stars.

Two of three astronauts from the Apollo mission go to the moon and find an unexpected cosmonaut (Russian) landing and something else as they explore the area.  Finding one of the cosmonaut pilots dead, they become consumed with trying to find answers.  When they do, things start to go wrong fast and they race against time to leave the moon.

Out of the gate, the production design is amazing.  The costumes, the props, the lighting - everything is perfect.  The way they matched the new footage to the stock footage is so perfect you can't tell which is which.  ""Apollo 18"" was clearly a labor of love for a lot of people, and not a slapdash film.

The ""found footage"" aspect works well, and I was even able to suspend a lot of disbelief.  I did find myself wondering, not how moon creatures could live in a vacuum, but what they would eat, and how our biochemistry could be even remotely compatible with theirs.  However, the story was interesting, the actors were excellent, and the movie kept me within the movie at most times.  It even delivered a few scary moments.

I'm so done with horror movies about the group of teens stranded at the log cabin in the woods. Here we get a small group of guys stranded in space. At least with the teens in the woods there was always the hope that they could get back to civilization. Here, a more bleak setting is in play which for me heightened the hopelessness of the situation.

This is not a gore fest or a pop-out and make you jump in your seat movie. This is a spooky, creepy flick. Which I really liked.

The movie early on has just the right amount of liking the main characters and connecting with their friendship together. So much more than most movies that are plot driven.

Yes, there were a couple of times something could have popped out of the dark and scared the viewer, but it didn't happen and I think that was part of the suspense because I was expecting it.

The special effects were good, making the setting and ""things happening"" believable.

The acting was well done. Better than most SciFy Channel movies.

4342470,3,B004EPYZXK,"I had very mixt feelings when I finished watching this film. I rate it three stars (which means ""It is OK""), because it was not bad enough for me to hate it - but also certainly not good enough to be liked. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

As we learn at the very beginning of the film, this is the story of the ""Apollo 18"" lunar mission - which officially never took place. It seems however, that some conspiracy theory passionates found ""lost footage"" filmed during this mission - the film is supposed to be a kind of ""you tube"" viewing of those miraculously recovered tapes...

Three astronauts were send to the Moon in ""Apollo 18"", which officially was an unmanned probe - it was necessary to invent this cover story to deceive the public, as it is a little bit hard to conceal the take-off of a Saturn V giant rocket from Cape Canaveral... Commander Nathan Walker and Captain Ben Walker were supposed to land on the Moon and deploy some special electronic captors for the Department of Defense (the official reason why this mission is so secret) - Lieutenant-Colonel John Grey was supposed to stay in the orbiter and wait for the return (the same procedure as in real lunar manned mission).

Well, as you can see on the cover, at least one of them will land on Moon and he will have a great number of reasons to regret it... No more spoilers here.

Now, visually this film is a very good thing - the ""lost footage"" seems really like something that could really have been taken during a genuine lunar mission. Spaceships interiors and lunar landscape were well done, no argument there. Actors were unknown to me, but they did a good job. Sound editing was particularly well done and acoustics play an important role in this film - freaky interferences which plague radio communications during most of the film were really well thought and conceived.

However, I must say that I didn't care for most of the scenario. Some limited SPOILERS here. Really, people, would it really hurt that in at least one SF film people who are send on a mission are actually briefed about the REAL reasons for their mission? Virtually everything that happens past the first 30 minutes is such a ""clich"", that we can anticipate EVERY single development until the final credits... It is amazing, how one can combine a rather original initial idea (a secret lunar mission) with every and each one of the un-original, stereotyped, saw-it-all-one-thousand-times-before, yawn+fastforward tricks.

Some reviewers didn't like the general scientific idea behind the scenario, but I for one rather appreciated it. Possible HUGE SPOILER ahead: if you are concerned about the scientific realism of this film, please go on the internet and look up the very real living creatures called ""tardigrades"", most complex of all currently known polyextremophiles... But if you didn't see this film yet, you may want to postpone this research for after the viewing. However, once again, the excellent initial idea of hasards lurking on the Moon was wasted by the following accumulation of all possible and imaginable ""clichs"".

So bottom line, I personally found this film OK, but somehow disappointing. But one can not deny it some originality in the general ideas and the visual and acoustic aspects are pretty well done indeed. Therefore, if you are into SF and/or horrors, you are encouraged to see it and make up your own mind. Otherwise do not bother. In any case I will not keep this DVD for any future viewings.",1365638400,5,3514,4.798347107438016

This film is yet,(*sigh*)ANOTHER prodigy in the long and ever growing line of Blair Witch Project imitators. Yep the old bait and switcheroo,with fuzzy and fast camera cuts,dark and spooky lighting,strange noises coming from....?,etc.,etc. It is all SO predictable. This latest incarnation takes us to the moon on a mission that never officially existed. The opening tells us that the movie is made up of footage(inference that it is ""real"") that was uploaded to a certain web site a couple of years ago.
The film is shot using aging techniques quite common in use today,to make it look like 70s film stock. We follow three astronauts from pre flight with their families,to lift off,their journey and orbital path around the moon to two of the astronauts final descent and landing. This classified mission was put together so they could install  early warning instruments to detect Soviet missiles. Everything up until the moment they install the devices goes smoothly. Of course we know it won't last forever and on cue the creepy noise interference over their intercoms starts coming through. Then they find strange tracks in the lunar surface. They also find a Russian space module that has landed before their flight and the pilot is dead in a nearby crater. The officials back home give them so much info,but it is obvious they knew about the Russians and their mission.
They start to find things moved around in the LEM and their communications totally fail. They wake up one morning to find the U.S.flag is gone and their ROVER has been tipped over. One of them goes out to investigate and suddenly reports something in his helmet and falls. The other comes out and brings him in. He has limited memory recall on what just happened and they find a laceration on his rib cage. In fact there is something underneath the skin. They manage to pull it out and after a brief screeching noise,they look down and it is just a lunar rock. The astronaut's infection continues and as their LEM has now been disabled by something unknown,they head out to the Russian capsule. Along the way their ROVER gets turned over and the infected astronaut wanders off. The other looks and finds him but watches as he is pulled into a crater by unseen forces. He follows but watches as all the rocks start coming to life around him. He flees to the Russian module and is securely inside. He makes contact with the third astronaut who has been circling above the moon and they agree to rendezvous. Transmission from Earth has now recommenced and NASA is warning the third astronaut not to rendezvous with his compatriot. He ignores his superiors and awaits his buddy's return. However on the way up we see rocks aboard the Russian capsule start to rise and come to life and attack the astronaut. In distress he cannot control the  Russian capsule and the craft crashes into the other,most likely killing both. The film ends in a typed post script as we are told the official reasons for the death of the astronauts;all earth born accidents with no bodies recovered. It also mentions that some of the lunar material actually brought back from the moon,has been given away to foreign countries and alot of it has simply disappeared.
I must say for us who grew up and watched these lunar landings way back in the day,this re-creation looks pretty good in so far as the equipment used,both personal and vehicular. But the story is just way too predictable and quite pedestrian,at best. It is yet another case of taking half truths and inferences and making grand leaps of logic to convey a ""truthful"" message. This is the conspiracy theorists playground and right up their alley. Nice try guys,but no cigars for any of you.
Technically speaking,the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1,with some parts being full frame to simulate the camera technology of the 70s. Extras include multiple endings,several deleted and alternate scenes and commentary.

Someone uncovers the tapes of this secret, classified, NASA mission, that was buried and turns it into this film. Apollo 18 shows how the astronauts came into contact with extra terrestrial life. I was expecting this to be a trippy Sci-Fi movie, it wasn't. I also thought maybe the aliens would be hostile and it would be an action packed horror flick, not really. The truth is, it's hard to say what this was besides bad! First of all, the look they use for effect, hampered the viewers, the constant interruption and flashes were just annoying! The actors really have no dialogue outside of their work, meaning we know basically nothing about them, so there is no connection with the audience.

4342519,3,B004EPYZXK,"In 1972, the Department of Defense launches Apollo 18 on a secret mission to the moon. Objective: Unknown. Its crew would never return. Nearly 30 years later, their footage has been found. If you aren't already a fan of the ""found-footage"" genre, APOLLO 18 is unlikely to change that fact, but for anyone who enjoys watching in horror through the shaky first-person perspective of the camera will find this to be another fresh new take on the format. Director Gonzalo Lpez-Gallego has taken great care in making every scene feel authentic by properly aging the footage and dressing down the technology to fit the early 1970's. The cramped space station and craterous moon setting add the the believability, and allow for a suspension of disbelief as we travel alongside the cosmonauts in zero-gravity. While this particular style does lend credibility to the plot, it is also cause for a lot of expected slow-downs in the pace, with the action being spread thin throughout the entire run-time. Fear and paranoia do set in much like in THE THING once the men discover that there is life on other worlds. An interesting use of the format to be sure, APOLLO 18 nevertheless reaches the limit of its own high concept quickly as the audience eagerly awaits any signs of life from the film.

4342527,4,B004EPYZXK,"Why has man never returned to the moon? Apparently we have. In Apollo 18 we learn that NASA and the Department of Defense sent a secret manned mission to the moon in 1974 in order to install a device to spy on Russian communications. The men were outfitted with Kodachrome hand-held cameras in order to document the mission. They never made it back to Earth. A space conspiracy website called The Lunar Truth somehow obtained 84 hours of footage from this mission and edited it down to 90 minutes before uploading it onto their website. Apollo 18 is a found footage movie detailing the fate of the astronauts.

I love stories that take place in isolated settings and the surface of the moon is about as isolated as you can get. Apollo 18 is yet another found footage tale and a fairly effective one at that. The isolation of the moon combined with the claustrophobic interior of the space capsule heightens the tension once otherworldly dangers are encountered. Apollo 18 takes a while to get going and in the interim we watch the 3 astronauts go through the machinations of their job while exchanging stilted conversation about their lives back on Earth. The scares are mostly of the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night variety but they work well here. The final 10 minutes are especially tense/gripping. The found footage looks terrific and matches the look of real moon landing footage that we have seen all of our lives.

4342600,2,B004EPYZXK,"The movie is technically very well done, but its premise is lacking.  Aliens that mimic Moon rocks?  Which live in space but can function just fine in an atmosphere, and which happen to be able to eat humans?  What do they normally live on and how is it they can digest us, when they aren't native to our planet?  Also the military sent astronauts there but then refused to let them return with the organisms they were presumably sent to bring back in the first place?  The f*ck?  (Maybe they were trying to avoid getting too close to the premise in ""Aliens"".)  Also, the idea of these space beasties attacking astronauts on the Moon was reminiscent of the movie Red Planet, almost like that was a(nother?) borrowed idea.

That said, the producers obviously did their homework.  The moonwalks etc. look very realistic (though the guys do seem to be walking in Earth gravity from time to time).  The Soviet lander was right, which is very impressive--that's pretty obscure, and the Soviet lander was indeed a one-man craft called the LK.  The fact that the astronauts identified it as an ""LK-Proton"" is curious (since the Proton is a rocket, not a spacecraft), but a 1970s astronaut probably wouldn't have all the terminology right since the Soviet lunar program was top secret, and he did well to get it right at all.  A Soviet lunar landing, had one actually happened, would likely have been lifted on Proton rockets since the N1 Moon rocket was a failure and the Soviets' unmanned lunar flyby tests were lifted on Protons.

I would really like to give this 2.5 stars, because it's so well-done technically; too bad half stars aren't available.  But given a choice of a 2 or a 3, I come down on a 2 because the plot is so far-fetched.",1351468800,,1735,4.609120521172638

The concept? Apollo 18 is cancelled circa 1974...or is it? Perhaps it actually launched as a secret Department of Defense mission, so secret that the crew may not even be aware of why they are really heading to the moon. Once at the moon they embark on their supposed mission, but find that there is more to the task than what they signed up for.

It's unfortunate that there's currently not a running format like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Crypt/dp/B001CT05SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Crypt</a>&nbsp;that writers and directors can go to in order to present cool concepts like the one in Apollo 18, because this movie would have made a pretty good 26 minute short versus the hour and 26 minute long feature film. All of the story content and action could easily have been condensed into less than a half hour, which--done the right way--could have made for a creepy, edge of your seat thrill of a ride. But after 90 minutes of jumpy, static-filled, hand-held camera work with only moments of action at a time...the only time I found myself on the edge of my seat was as I was slipping off my couch in a doze.

Sio if there's absolutely nothing else on TV and you see that Apollo 18 is starting on one of the premium cable channels, well...you can see for yourself whether I am right or wrong. But do not wait for regular TV to watch Apollo 18; add commercials to this film, and you will be hard pressed to make all the way through.",1351296000,,1761,4.767213114754099

Apollo 18. 3 Astronauts where sent to the moon to plant some sort of spy device... only they discover that may not have been the reason they where sent there after all, especially when they discover something else might be on the moon with them?

That may sound interesting, but let me tell you, for most of the movie, you are just bored to death waiting for something to happen as you are treated to annoying sound effects of heavy breathing and what sounds like someone dropping a coin into the porcelain rim of a toilet bowl. What this movie needed was for Jason Voorhees to pop up and say ""...."" and then slaughter these guys 5 mins into the movie and end it right there, but instead you have to sit through the done to death boring scenes where a small shadow or a blurry image show up now and then before you see what is actually happening... which is not worth the wait, it's a stupid idea, and I wish I could just say what it is so you too can hear how lame it sounds, but that would be spoiling the movie for anyone who wants to go against me and check out the film anyway.

It must be a pretty boring time for movies if this was the one that sounded the most interesting amongst what is currently a new release. I may not always review every movie I see, I just review the ones I have something to say about them, but by all means, don't check this one out over ""Thats my boy"", ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" or ""Avengers""... man, this one makes the last 3 look like all time greats already compared to this snore fest.

Response: ""We will say it's a true story, actual footage 'n stuff"" ""Neat!, that might work then, lets allow you to release it""... Amazing how the footage of this movie floated back to Earth from the moon and managed to make it's way into the atmosphere without burning up and landed in one piece where someone could watch it. Or maybe that's the storyline behind ""Apollo 19: The search for footage floating around in space under a pile of spider rocks in the corner of a space witches old home""... probably will star Lance Henrikson... but like it's predecessor, I won't be holding my breath to see it, and if I do, well there is another and a half of my life wasted I could have been doing something better with... like watching cars rust.",1351296000,,2844,4.413333333333333

4342689,5,B004EPYZXK,"One of the more unusual entries in the found-footage field, Apoloo 18 pieces together footage of a secret final mission to the moon in the 1970s, launched at night under cover of a routine satellite launch.  Using tapes and film reels from before the mission launch on Earth as well as material recorded onboard the moon lander, the orbiting ship and even cameras and microphones on and in the astronauts's space suits, the movie follows the events on that fateful mission and reveals the meaning behind the film's tagline, ""There's a reason we've never been back to the moon.""

The small crew believes they're being sent to the moon to set up equipment that will serve as part of a space-based early warning system against a potential Russian missile attack.  After setting down, the astronauts make the surprise discovery of a Russian craft already in the vicinity, apparantly a recent landing, hastily abandoned and with no sign of the cosmonauts themselves.  From there, they go from simply making surprise discoveries to suspecting that there's A Lot about this mission that the higher-ups never told them, as findings and unexplained happenings on the moon's surface go from the merely unexpected to the baffling and eerie.

Sometimes a movie rises and falls on how well it can make the really 'out there' seem real and credible.  If one was to just write down some of what happens in the movie's final stages it might sound preposterous to someone who hasn't seen the movie, but here the filmmakers make it work.  Well, to me they certainly did.  Judging by the unexpectedly low ratings the film often receives, obviously not everyone feels that way, but I thought the end stages and resolutions came off far more engaging and authentic than a number of other higher-profile, more widely seen space-based movies.

The small cast does a great job, great suspense, the search for the fate of the missing cosmonauts, the conflict between the astronauts stuck in the unknown and the mission controllers back on Earth guiding them, and the final answers about what was really found on the moon that caused both the US and the Soviet Union to abruptly abandon the largest part of their fiercely competitive, multi-billion dollar space race, successfully round out this imaginative and surprisingly effective horror/science fiction hybrid.",1348963200,5,2339,5.007731958762887

According to this film though there was a secret mission in 1974 where a couple of astronauts went up to the moon thanks to the U.S. Dept. of Defense's money and they go to the south side of the moon.

Of course according to the makers this is actual NASA footage uncovered in 2011 and shows the reason we've never gone back to the crater filled moon over our planet. After landing they goof around a bit on the surface then weird things start to happen, like scary noises, odd shadows and shapes appearing out of the corner of their eye and the typical horror cliches as both guys freak out as they are by themselves against an unknown terror.

This movie is not what I would call an artistic success, due to the PG-13 rating there's a lot of cuts from anything reasonably scary, most of the time the camera goes all static or blank when something terrifying is supposed to be occuring.

It's a clever premise and whereas normally these films can be done on the cheap ('Blair Witch' is effectively a bunch of kids running around a forest with a video camera), this surely had quite a substantial budget with all the sets and effects.

The most impressive thing about 'Apollo 18' is the quality of the footage. It all looks authentically 1970s, even down to the colour saturation and the lines on the TV screens. Genius! Less impressive is its desire to capture the verisimilitude of a moon landing. To do this, it's necessary for minutes and minutes of unnecessary, eventless, one could even saying boring footage. That creates a degree of realism but costs the narrative dear. The result is a horror movie that is more clever than frightening. You experience it in the brain, not gut. That said there are some wonderfully creepy moments, especially when they first discover the Soviet lunar module.

One final point (with an obvious spoiler). If this is supposed to be a found footage movie and a lot of that footage was done on hand cameras (so not broadcast back) and it all ends terribly for the crew... how could the recordings have ever got back to earth to be uploaded?",1337990400,,1486,4.66412213740458

For one, it contains the classic alien spider that is in some other science fiction movies. For another, they never tell how the so-called found footage made it from the moon back to earth. And telling of all, why would so-called authentic footage contain four different alternate endings? if something happens in real life, one can not say, ""I don't like the way this went. I think I'll make a different ending. I may have given it more than two stars if they had come up with some sort of original alien. The movie is okay if you like those type.

The astronauts are sent to the moon. They land within walking distance of a failed Russian craft with its innards ripped apart. There's blood all over the place. The astronauts discover a mummified Russian cosmonaut in the bottom of a crater. A moon rock is embedded in his suit.

I can't even explain why this movie is so bad without giving away all its secrets. It's absolute rubbish from the first frame to the last.

4342906,2,B004EPYZXK,"Yet another ""found footage"" genre movie, ""Apollo 18"" with its intriguing premise about the cancelled Apollo 18 mission has potential for a better sci-fi thriller. Co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov (""Night Watch"" ""Wanted""), the mocumentary tells the story of three astronauts and their ""top secret"" mission on the moon in the ""Paranormal Activity"" fashion, but the end result is a dull and thrill-less 86-minute ride.

Those who are expecting something intelligent like ""Forbidden Planet"" or, more recently, ""Moon"" will be disappointed with how the film, of which opening is surely promising, quickly turns into a series of set-pieces that are unimaginative and predictable, heavily dependent on cheap fright techniques. Directed by Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego, ""Apollo 18"" is visually impressive, with footage that looks authentic, but its storytelling is just boring.

The film needs someone like Duncan Jones, who knows how to grab our attention by effectively developing the film's original concept, or perhaps a more conventional narrative style that does not rely on frequent POV shots.",1334275200,,1084,5.603658536585366

Please complete college before posting a review. THAT WAS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THIS MOVIE, it was SUPPOSED TO BE ""SHAKEY FILMING"" as it was supposed to be ""LOST FOOTAGE"". It wasn't intended to be a Hollywood movie. It was supposed to look like it was just a collection of lost footage that was stolen from NASA. The bad filming was part of the story...

The movie itself wasn't all that bad. It was a nice change for me. Although the aliens made of rocks was a little lame, I guess it was better than the normal grey aliens. Although, that may have made the move a little more creepy. It's a little expensive for this type of movie, I would rather get something like this from the $5 bin at Walmart.

4342908,1,B004EPYZXK,"I kinda hated this movie.

I remember going to the movies with a friend of mine a year or so ago. We saw a preview for what at first looked like an amazing movie: astronauts went to the moon, but they had a secret mission. When the cameras were off, they ran across the lunar surface to the...ruins! My jaw was open in amazement until I realized it was just a Transformer movie. I was so disappointed to see the concept wasted. So, then when I heard about Apollo 18, I thought someone had resuscitated the idea. Finally I'd get to see a movie maybe close to that first half of a preview which had blown me away...

But this is not a good movie. First of all, I hesitate to call it a feature length film. The credits start rolling at 1 hour and 19 minutes. The plot is boring and slow and boring and also boring. It's also boring and it will bore you. Then it will make you bored. There are no surprises. You won't care about any of the characters. There are no interesting visuals or designs. Be careful what posture you watch the film in. You ARE likely to actually fall asleep.

I really kind of want my money back. I feel conned after paying for this boring and short waste of a concept. Maybe I'll have to write a variation on this idea that has been wasted twice now if I ever want to enjoy the story I keep getting teased.

4342914,5,B004EPYZXK,"i think most reviewers kind of missed the real selling point of this movie. the selling point is not some 'Blair Witch' contrivance, but space exploration and NASA itself. i was suprised at how many people didn't even note how accurate and realistic it's portrayl of NASA in the 1970's is. oh but i forgot. it seems that viewers these days are more enamored with the catoonish, comic book portrayls of space technology in overgrandized kiddie fare like 'Avatar' or 'Star Trek'. personally i prefer realism in my science fiction.
  realistic science fiction is often overlooked in favor of fantasy. i prefer movies like '2001' or the original 'Andromeda Strain'. at least those films are plausible and don't make you giddy with a over active imagination.
  'Apollo 18' was somewhat predictable in it's soryline, but not in it's art direction and concept. instead of being about the future like the 'Alien' film, this film is about the past and therefore a period piece. it even has photography that sucessfully duplicates a lot of NASA footage. George Lucas acheived a very similar effect with his award winning film 'American Graffiti when he purposely used cheap film stock to duplicate the effect of low budget, drive-in movies of the early sixties. photography in 'Apollo 18' is used to similar effect, and with stunning result.
  this was a very impressive work of current cinema. unfortunately people these days don't want realism in Sci Fi. Sci Fi author Ray Bradbury once took serious note of that sad fact. i was actaully kind of alarmed at how many people failed to understand the realism and the attempt to educate in this compelling and interesting homage to America's space program. even if this does incite goverment paranoia somewhat.",1332806400,7,1748,4.969178082191781

4342937,2,B004EPYZXK,"Ever since THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT ""lost footage"" movies have become a genre unto themselves. Some have done well at the box office, some have received no notice and others just exist. Then there are films like APOLLO 18 that use the device well but just sit there.

APOLLO 18 is supposed to be comprised of footage that was secreted away after the failed expedition to the moon. So secret was the mission that the blast off was hidden as a mission to launch a satellite rather than a trip to the moon. Even the astronaut's families weren't told they were going to the moon.

All goes well at first. The team gets into space without a problem. The two man team landing on the moon's surface have a bit of difficulty but manage to land without a hitch. The moon rover works fine and they collect samples without error. But something goes wrong eventually.

The two men on the surface come across another space ship on the moon. This one is Russian and something happened. To begin with, no one knew that this ship was here or even that the Russian's launched a moon expedition. Secondly, the interior of the ship has been trashed. After a bit of searching, the pair follows footsteps that lead them to the dead cosmonaut, his suit ripped and his helmet smashed.

Other odd things happen as well. A moon rock supposedly locked away in storage is found in the landing module. The flag they planted disappears. And eventually one of the astronauts comes down with some space disease where he sees things and is wounded.

What could have been a film that makes you wonder are they really seeing things or are they hallucinating becomes instead a movie that lets you have glimpses that yes indeed, there are creatures on the moon. These start with things we viewers see in the periphery of the cameras lens, items that are just at the rims of our visibility. Something moves or something falls and while the main characters aren't aware we most certainly are.

Eventually the question is posed will NASA try to bring these men back or leave them stranded in space? Will they allow them to die fearing what they might bring back to Earth or will they rescue them?

As with another lost footage film, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, this one plays off the spooks of being stranded in a world where you have no control over what's happening around you. Unlike that film it doesn't really scare you or make you jump with the exception of one loud noise that surprises you. Whoopee.

Confined to a small cabin and a few feet of the moon's surface, the movie feels cramped and stagnant like the air in the capsule. It doesn't offer enough scares to frighten and doesn't develop the characters enough to make you feel concern for their plight. Sure we see scenes of them with their families at the beginning but since it was more like home movies we don't get enough chance to form a bond with them. In so doing we end up just not caring.

At the end of the day APOLLO 18 just doesn't hold up. It never holds your interest enough. The scares just aren't scary. The ""real life footage"" feels repetitive and the items at the edges make you feel more like you're playing Where's Waldo rather than seeing some creature in a space capsule.

If you feel the need to see all movies that qualify as horror or all movies that are the ""lost footage"" genre, then you'll want to rent this one. If not there are plenty of other good movies worth renting. Long before the end of this one I could tell that it was one I'd never watch again.",1332201600,,3501,4.481946624803768
4342938,4,B004EPYZXK,"When I saw this on opening day in a theater with about a dozen other people present, I found it to be both not as bad as I had feared, and not as good as I had hoped.  Credit must be given for the cleverness of combining the seemingly exhausted found-footage horror genre, with the realistic historic space exploration genre, while using a significant amount of real archival footage and using mostly period-accurate equipment to capture the new footage.  The result is something that costs very little to make, yet is fairly convincingly real more often than expected.  This is also clever in that it appeals in different ways to the established audiences for found-footage horror, science fiction, docudrama, and conspiracy theory drama audiences.  With just a modest initial weekend draw on each of those special-interest audiences, the film easily made back it's estimated 5 million dollar budget. Two big caveats which may be very specific to a very small population other than myself: I am a sucker for anything Apollo-related, and I don't care that the film was never for even a moment even slightly scary.  I don't go to movies to squeal like a schoolgirl at cheap scare tactics, so I was not disappointed when my pulse remained steady. And after all of that rather jaded criticism, I must say it really was an honest and mostly successful attempt to make an interesting and involving film.  No offense to the director, but this is very much a film created through a combination of many hours of largely improvised performances from good, understated actors, and a very fast-working and creative editing and audio post production team.  The only significant failure of this film was in not conveying any real sense of just how terrifying it must have been for the real Apollo astronauts, even on missions that went mostly by the book.  It is hard to imagine just how absolutely hostile to human life the environment outside of those tiny spacecraft and EVA suits really is.  The unusually lengthy selection of cut, extended, and alternate scenes on this DVD/Blu-Ray release are an enjoyable diversion, giving much insight into the process of making the film.",1332115200,4,2166,4.912328767123288

4343028,2,B004EPYZXK,"Technically there's really nothing all that wrong with this film. It uses the ""found footage"" format (crudely shot amateur video from a single limited point of view as if someone captured it on a home movie camera), which is fine and in this case fits the overall intent of the story.

Nothing much wrong with the acting either. In fact the performances are quite passable.

The visuals and effects work okay as well. Nothing too spectacular was required but what there is works just fine.

The problem isn't even with the story itself, though there's nothing really new here. An Apollo crew goes on a secret mission to the moon and encounters alien creatures.

What sinks the entire enterprise is the overall of the project. It is unrelentingly grim, certainly not the sort of thing you want to watch for entertainment.

You get the feeling it is something rather dark and unpleasant just by looking at the poster. A previously unknown Apollo moon mission that you've never heard about before which, logic tells you, must have been lost with all hands. That's kind of depressing to consider and it's what you realize just from the poster.

Not that it couldn't have been a tragedy, like one of the Shakespeare plays were everyone dies in the end, like Romeo & Juliet or Hamlet. Both of those are great works, full of engaging thoughts and idea.

But what's missing in Apollo 18 is any sense of heroism or transcendant sacrifice. Basically it's a trio of ordinary guys who got lied to by those they work for (NASA, the US government) and callously sent to their deaths in the interests of... well, we never find out why (another problem). Mostly what we get is three guys in a tight spot struggling to stay alive, even though we already know they are all going to die in the end.

And they do exactly what real people in such circumstances would do... panic, rage, totally freak out, try anything they can think of to survive. None of them have any kind of epiphany about the need to sacrifice themselves, none of them do anything particularly noble. They're just a trio of already doomed guys wasting their time and effort trying to stay alive. That's not what I would call entertainment. You get about the same feeling you would if you stabbed an animal in the gut and then just watched it suffer and slowly bleed to death.

I could consider it an unsuccessful attempt to do what others managed to pull off in the original Director's cut of ""Butterfly Effect"". For the theatrical release of that one the studio required the filmmakers to tack on a silly ""happy ending"" which totally negated the entire rest of the story. In the original cut, the lead character dies. But he does so willingly because he understands he must to help or save others, which elevates it to a kind of heroic, nobel self-sacrifice. True, it's also pretty grim to watch but there is a feeling of something transcendant going on (despite how unpleasant the outcome is.) In the case of Apollo 18 there's no such ""moral"" or ""point"" to things.

If you really want to get the major feeling raised by this movie, watch the TV news for the next story about a bunch of miners trapped alive in a collapsed tunnel, where they make it plain there's no way they're going to ever be rescued. It feels a lot like that. And the miners would be a lot easier on your wallet, being TV news and thus free.",1330387200,,3363,4.571428571428571

You thought Apollo 17 was our last lunar mission? You think the Russians never landed on the moon? Got news for you conspiracy minded types out there; neither of these is true. Sent up under the guise of a National Security/Department of Defense kind of Top Secret mission, our three astronauts board the Liberty and Freedom vehicles for one more investigation of what's really up there. It ain't the Sea of Tranquility, that's for sure.

Before you know it, something is making creepy noises outside the Lunar Module. Samples are suddenly not where the explorers originally left them. And them dastardly things ripped up the USA flag! Not only are these critters scary, they're downright UnAmerican! Then again, they weren't too nice to the Ruskie that landed there before Apollo 18, and the unlucky astronauts realize that their government may not have told them everything about their journey or its intended mission. The handheld cameras soon begin jerking and spinning, the automatic cameras are going static, and the humans just might be losing their minds.

""Apollo 18"" mixes just enough ""now-you-see-it"" spookiness to add some real scare jolts, but mostly, it's dopey space B-Movie fun. The Metal Munching Moon Mice from the old Bullwinkle cartoons were about as believable as the space bug monsters wreaking havoc on our helpless heroes, and some of the effects are laughably bad.

appreciate this attempt. If you your a Hollywood action kind of guy, this will bore you to tears. I was surprised how

good the script and acting was for this grade of film, being you had to approach this as major fantasy right from the

get go. The plot suffered from the typical Hollywood thrown together screen play lack of depth or logic because of no

research into similar highly rated written works. The sound effects really bothered me because it was way over the top

and unbelievable. The part that really ruined the movie was the missed opportunity to incorporate any story

elements from written works and resorting to the same old moon rock giant pubic lice type monster stuff so typical of

poorly thought out movies financed by God knows who.

Here was a perfect chance to use the moving black pools of helium from Larry Niven's short story ""The coldest Place"".

Also, a perfect opportunity to use the interesting concept/fate of the astronaut from another Larry Niven short called

""wait it Out"" that could have been used as a cliff hanger for a sequel if the the movie made any attempt at creativity or

greatness. These are examples of ideas that would have turned this movie into a 4 or 5 star movie if any effort was made

by the writer/director to research other written works in hard sci-fi literature.

While I'm on my soap box, the sci-fi movie genre seems to have stumbled into this situation of recycling the same old,

seen it before stuff that has been done to death. Well, except for ""Moon"", but that was more of a political ""Silent

Running"" type of effort and not really adventurous hard sci-fi. PLEASE, somebody invest in an effort to bring some

When the director of the film is a non-American you can then double the one star reviews. With the recent cancellation of America's Apollo missions you can then double again the one star reviews. I'm not sure if there is any other topic that most Americans are so hyper sensitive about than the Apollo moon landings. It's so extreme to be bordering on maniacal. The mere mention to someone that the moon landings might have been staged sends most Americans into a hyper frenzy to the point that the topic can't be discussed or debated without Apollo supporters throwing barbs and punches. So you know a movie such as this is going to get most people writing a negative review whether the movie deserves one or not. Sure the reviewer will claim the film is implausible or boring or what have you, but the heart of it is that they don't like America's most storied historical achievement (assuming of course that it actually happened) being tarnished in any way, shape or form - especially by a non-American.

As for the movie itself I found it very entertaining and very suspenseful. I liked the hand held cam and the ""file footage"" style to the ""documentary."" I thought it worked well in this film.

4343277,2,B004EPYZXK,"Review: Apollo 18

For tonight's movie night we watched Apollo 18. I went in with relatively low expectations since there are very few found footage movies that actually entertain me. Going all the way back to The Blair Witch I have found the technique more annoying than anything else.

In this case it was used quite effectively as they cut from camera to camera to show footage of the crew as they encountered... strange happenings on the moon. But the fundamental problem remains which is that it's distracting from the story.

I spent a lot of time thinking about the cleverness of how they mimicked the 70s film reel look and the graininess of this sort of footage. It also distanced me from the characters because I was always conscious I was looking at them through a camera.

The idea was clever, the acting and script more than serviceable and at times there was a fair amount of tension. But it felt overlong. Like a 45 minute Twilight Zone episode expanded to movie length.

I'd stream it on Netflix or rent it from RedBox but I think that's about all it's worth.",1327708800,,1075,4.578125
4343278,5,B004EPYZXK,"The movie came quick in perfect condition. The movie started off slow to me, that was expected but not as long as I found it, that was irritating.

I gave it a five star for being a ""surprise"" which I enjoyed. I hope this helps someone. I don't like spolier's so I will not say further other than u will enjoy this movie. Long start and all. And leave it at that. Enjoy. Amazon Rocks!",1327708800,2,556,4.0636363636363635
4343279,4,B004EPYZXK,"The film was actually better than I feared it was going to be (after reading all of the negative reviews and such) but I found it pretty authentic in it's portrayal of a moon mission gone wrong (granted, I've never done any serious studying of any actual moon mission films, so enthusiasts of moon mission imagery will probably be able to pick this thing apart till the cows come home, but for the average viewer, I found it pretty real, I mean, at least the space suits didn't look like someone's mom had sewn them together with some bed sheets, which is always a plus in my book).

But  that being said, this is not a film for people looking for a non-stop action rush, this is a slower burn type of film, in the same vain as the recent, Paranormal Activity movies, but in space.

So if you like stuff to do with the moon landings and have a thing for revisionist history/conspiracy theories, then this film is your cup of tea (or, Tang, as it were, and if you didn't get that reference, then you're not as big a moon mission aficionado as you may have thought you were before you started to read this review '

***SPOILER ALERT*** (go and watch the film, then come back and read this as I think you'll find it quite interestingly compelling)

Okay, so here's my BIG overall problem with this film (and correct me if I'm wrong here) but what we're watching is supposedly, ""Found Footage"" taken during this ill fated mission, film footage, not video sent back to mission control on earth, cameras with actual film cartridges in them that have to be developed before they can be run through a projector to be watched (keeping in mind that this was way before digital camera technology came into existence).

So here's my problem; how, if the film from the moon cameras (you know, the ones showing Ben meandering about the moon's surface trying to avoid his demented colleague and the rock spider/crab creatures, in his mad attempt to reach the Russian space ship and escape the lunar horror of it all) is still actually in the cameras (as we never see Ben getting the film from them, during his frantic flight for survival) and then what film Ben did manage to bring with him in the Russian space craft was blown up when the Russian craft and the moon obiter crashed, then how are we watching any of this footage???

Let's see, we have some footage stranded on the moon, and the rest has been atomized in the collision between the two ships in lunar orbit, and even if, let's say for the sake of argument, that another mission went back to the moon, better prepared to fight off the, ""Moon Mites"", then all that they would have is the stuff taken on the moon's surface and nothing taken from inside the space ships because that has been lost in the collision of the two ships in orbit.

So there you have the BIGGEST deterrent to the possible believability of this movie, the one thing that they shot themselves in the foot with, the lack of any explanation as to how any surviving footage could have, well, made it's way back to earth to be, ""Leaked"" to the internet in the first place (had they been using video cameras everywhere that sent video images and sound, back to mission control then sure, this would have been plausible, but the fact that at one point Ben is gathering up film cartages to be taken back to earth (before everything went, ""Loopy"") and we never see him bring said film cartridges to the Russian ship at the end (and like I mentioned, even if he had, the ship collides with the lunar orbiter in orbit around the moon) so anyway you slice it, the film could never have made it back to Earth.

Also, really, rock creatures, hasn't that been done to death, but I guess that is the only way they could try and add a, ""Chill"" factor to the films end by indicating that lots of moon rocks have made their way to earth during the previous 17 Apollo missions and could in fact be rock creatures as well (but the stupid flaw in this theory is that it is indicated that the rocks that are these creatures, are from a recent impact site, which would indicate that the rock creatures were not indigenous to the moon but travelled there on this meteor or asteroid piece of space junk, which would also mean that they weren't present during the other 17 Apollo missions if this impact site was recent).",1327363200,,4314,4.450632911392405
4343280,3,B004EPYZXK,"I didn't see ""Apollo 18"" when it hit the theatres in September 2011 because it garnered almost uniformly horrible reviews on RottenTomatoes. I decided not to pay to see a movie that was panned so badly. But after it came out on DVD, I finally succumbed to curiosity and checked it out of the library. I must say it's not as bad as I expected.

Appealing to my space geekiness, ""Apollo 18"" features very realistic spaceflight hardware. The Apollo Service and Lunar Modules, the Lunar Roving Vehicle and the astronauts' spacesuits are very accurate, detailed and well-done. We rarely see the spacecraft exteriors, but the interior sets are great. While many viewers may not know it, the Soviet LK lander that plays a major role in ""Apollo 18"" represented real hardware. Despite denying it was in a race with the U.S., the Soviet Union tried feverishly to develop its huge, ill-fated N1 rocket specifically to launch manned spacecraft to the moon. The LK was the equivalent of the Apollo LM, and would have taken a cosmonaut down to the surface and back. ""Apollo 18"" depicts the LK very accurately. The scenes of it on the lunar surface convey a chilling sense of ""what might have been.""

The physical and digital lunar surface sets in ""Apollo 18"" are also striking. It's a far more rugged and rocky area than the actual Apollo landing sites, but the rationalization is that the Apollo 18 LM landed near the moon's heavily cratered South Pole. The combination of starkly beautiful gray-and-black landscapes and dramatic low-angle sunlight provides fantastic-looking, evocative images of the lunar surface. In short, the photography, lighting and visual effects in ""Apollo 18"" are superb, and they integrate perfectly with the occasional genuine NASA footage.

But there are many problems with the film. As one who never saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" (although I will cop to seeing ""Cloverfield""), I think the ""found footage"" moviemaking concept is a gimmick that has outlived its novelty. There's no reason to use it in ""Apollo 18."" The jerky hand-held camera shots, lens flares, over- and under-exposures, light leaks, color shifts and scratched film get tiresome pretty quickly. I believe the movie would have been MUCH better as a straightforward, conventionally filmed narrative. It's also way too short. Its scant 86 minutes of run time includes--I'm not making this up--more than 10 minutes of closing credits, so it's basically 76 minutes long! The plot unfolds so quickly that the viewer never really gets to know the characters, and everything seems rushed. The film should be about 30 to 45 minutes longer. The ""monsters"" are almost laughably lame. The filmmakers have an interesting idea for life forms that exist in the perpetual darkness of a lunar polar crater, but they never do much to develop it in detail. Also, the audio sucks, with wild variations of levels, indistinct and mumbled dialogue, interminable screaming and constant weird noises. The only way I could watch ""Apollo 18"" was to crank the volume down low and turn on the subtitles.

I'm glad I didn't waste time or money seeing ""Apollo 18"" at the theatre, but I'm equally glad I caught it on DVD. It's not a bad movie, but in my opinion it could have been much better. The story is intriguing, but the telling of it suffers from extreme brevity, distracting cinematic techniques, a dreadful soundtrack and slipshod editing in a few places (as the filmmakers admit in the audio commentary). Excellent production values and superb special effects are not enough to save it, just as the incalculable benefits of exploring another world were not enough to save the REAL Apollo 18 from the budgetary axes of shortsighted politicians.",1327276800,3,3729,4.990353697749196

I'll admit that the movie sounded like it might be interesting when I read the back of it at the video store.

Other reviewers here have gotten more into the technical aspects of the movie, so I don't feel the need to re-hash what has already been said. See, for instance, Ian's ""Houston, we have a REALLY big problem"" review of 9-2-2011. While I agree with his assessment of the mechanics of the movie, I disagree with his overall recommendation of it. Here's why:

First, the movie is only 1-1/4 hours long, so it draws to a close before you even know it.  The shortness is only intensified by the fact that the first 20 minutes of the movie are spent showing you what is made to look like archival footage from NASA.  So yeah, you get to see some astronauts, Mission Control, etc.  In my estimation, those 20 minutes effectively did little more than serve as filler--which tells you how anemic the movie actually is.  So when you factor out those essentially pointless 20 minutes, you're left with a film that is really less than an hour long.  This is not much time to develop anything of substance.

Second, the movie just isn't scary. It's moderately suspenseful at times, but that's as hair-raising as it gets.  If the whole point of a horror movie is to generate...well, horror and fear...then what's the use of producing a horror movie that fails to deliver on its primary purpose?

Third, I found the movie predictable at certain crucial moments.  I don't want to spoil it by offering specifics, but if the viewer can see some of the important plot twists or developments coming down the pike, it certainly lessens the experience and mimimizes the scare or suspense value.

So despite the reviewers who give this movie three or more stars, I would HIGHLY recommend to the potential buyer that you RENT IT first.  You may be very glad you did.",1326499200,2,1950,4.5501432664756445
4343359,1,B004EPYZXK,"I'm a big fan of the Space Program, followed all the launches in the early 60's as a child, the Gemini Launches, The Apollo Launches, I cried when the Apollo 1 Astronauts died in the fire, was devastated when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff and was heartbroken when Columbia broke up on re-entry.
I enjoyed Apollo 13 Immensely as a movie, although, I thought what happened to the astronauts in real life was nothing short of heart stopping but I thought it was very well done, the acting was superb and it brought to the screen one of the most riveting moments in NASA History at that point.

All that being said, we come to Apollo 18, the biggest problem with this movie is it doesn't offer ANYTHING fresh in the way of an idea for a great plot.....I'm going to paraphrase here.....""the government sent Apollo 18 to the moon on a top secret military funded project and shot film of the mission, this movie is the result of the film"" or words to that effect.
GEE, this sounds like deja Vu all over again, didn't we hear this in The Blair Witch Project and other films that followed it many years ago?.

I'm not going to get in depth about how directors should or shouldn't have done their jobs better or this and that differently, I just know this was a bad movie and I'm leaving it pretty much at that.  I actually think this is my first movie review on amazon.  What I can say is there was no ""personal"" factor in this movie at all.  They did a poor job making the characters likable, and through the entire movie it was hard to feel sorry for anyone because of that.  I still can't figure out who the lead role was, it seemed for the most part to be equally spread out between the two ""main"" characters.  I am a huge sci fi fan when it comes to extra terrestrials, I am also a big universe and the cosmos lover as well.  I put 2 and 2 together thinking I'd like this and boy was I ever wrong.

A prime example why I wait until movies are affordable enough from a rental standpoint and don't waste the 30.00 driving to the movies.

4343464,2,B004EPYZXK,"I originally saw this film displayed at the checkout counter at Rite Aid, so my expectation of the film was low. I bought it realizing that sometimes these unknown films are hidden treasures. Apollo 18 was not one of those films. The one thing I have to commend the filmmakers for was creating a realistic depiction of the 70's space program. The grainy simulated stock footage certainly gave the impression the footage was actually from the 70s. I should mention the production design and the simulated lunar surface have never been more realistically created as they are in this film. The filmmakers obviously studied meticulously the Apollo flights, which are now approaching forty years old.  Obviously, the filmmaker's eye for realism was done in order to make this a realistic horror film in the tradition of the Blair witch project, and several paranormal activity movies.

However, Apollo 18 falls short in the area of drama. There are only a few shocks in the film, while the rest of the story malingers on. Apparently, the astronauts along with a Soviet counterpart craft are sent to the moon to expose a contaminated life form. The astronaut's nemesis turns out to be spider-like creatures that hatch out of lunar rocks. To say this is ludicrous is an understatement. For the rest of the film basic science is thrown out the window and replaced with cheap thrills. The spider creatures themselves are generic looking CGI effects. The rest of the film resembles Alien, where the space spiders chase the hapless astronauts through the ship. None of the astronauts are allowed home.

How could the filmmakers in this day and age even contemplate any living organism on the moon? Maybe if the film was set on Mars it would at least be a bit more believable. This plot scenario would have worked better in the 50s, but today it is just silly. Then again there are those who still believe we did not land on the moon.

4343470,1,B004EPYZXK,"There are few movies that I finish and then fervently wish for the past few hours back. This was one of them. To list a few of the issues:

The ""found footage"" aspect did not add anything to the movie. I think it's just a popular style now, and the makers of this movie tried to get onboard. And that may work in some stories; in this, it made it very difficult to follow. You'd have a fairly good view of a character, then the camera would shake, the screen would be fuzzy, and you'd lose a few seconds. It seems like a small issue at first, but when it continues to happen it's just irritating. The dialogue was often fuzzy and too soft because of this as well. When you're shooting in something as small as a lander, you want all the camera view you can get. I will say that they at least had a few different camera angles, which was slightly redeeming.

For some unfathomable reason, NASA did not provide these guys with flashlights. Spacesuits, food, medical supplies, yes. But when they ventured out in the dark, they had a strobe light that intermittently caught you up on events. It's a testament to the pathetic storyline that even this failed to the make the movie remotely frightening.

The plot failed to advance. Nothing scary happened, and any foreshadowing was rendered meaningless because you couldn't see anything, due to the aforementioned issues. The most I can give it is slightly creepy, but you have to sit through way more than half the movie before anything happens. Even then, you don't really care. The characters were shallow and undeveloped, so their fright or confusion didn't really affect the audience. The threats in the movie were very cliche.

I could not recommend against seeing this movie more. It's thoroughly boring and uneventful. There are no redeeming qualities.",1325894400,7,1804,4.681388012618297

4343573,3,B004EPYZXK,"""Found footage"" horror films are a dime a dozen these days are words well spoken. Seems everywhere you look that some director is going that route. Sometimes, it makes me wish there was never a Blair Witch Project ever made for everyone to follow. Course, there was and, like remakes, it's something everyone is doing to make a buck filmwise these days. Despite that, there have actually been some original ones that were worth the effort to be made. So, where does Apollo 18 fit in, in all this?

Apollo 18 tells the story of a covert moon landing. The crew is tasked with setting up security cameras around the moon for national security reasons that are kept secret. While one is left in orbit, two of the astronauts land on the moon and begin their mission. Yet, during their mission, strange events begin to happen that suggest they are not alone there. When they come across a soviet ship, they assume that it is the soviets causing these strange events but they, all too soon, find out that it is something else.

I'll admit, I was taken in by the story. For the most part, the movie provided an ominous, spooky atmosphere. The way the movie was made actually made it seems like it was the 'real' thing..with all its' camera angles and different perspectives. It really drove home til....<SPOILER ALERT> we find out that that 'something else' was actually killer alien rocks(huh?)? Wha..? Mmmkay. I could buy killer aliens...or them coming across some other alien conspiracy...but killer alien rocks(and that's why they took samples from the moon)? Come on. I was expecting this really big payoff and this is what it amounts to? I was disappointed. That reason alone is why I gave the film only three stars.

Apollo 18 is a decent movie, mind you, and I do recommend it. Just don't expect it to be something it ain't. It could've been something much more if the director put forth the effort. As it stands, as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the better made 'Found Footage' movies in a long line of movies like that.",1325894400,2,2025,4.6194444444444445

Basically, the film is ""found footage"" of a mission to the moon gone hilariously (I mean, ""horribly"") wrong. Two young men are shot up to the moon on a secret mission (not so secret when you make a mainstream film out of it) to place detectors on the moon during the cold war.

I write a movie review blog and that weekend this was literally the only film that appealed to me. And quite literally, I was hoping this would have something truly creepy.

However, once we're aware of what the film's main threat is, it turns from being a somewhat creepy sci-fi horror film into the year's most unintentional comedy. I recall many people including myself actually LAUGHING during the screening. The MST3K crew would have a blast with this film, and here's to hoping someone at RiffTrax sees this and gives me a real reason to watch it again.

Other reviewers have raised the question of how this footage of the space mission could have been found if none of the three astronauts returned to earth.  The answer, if I understood one of the alternate endings, is that the astronaut in the command module did manage to return, although the theatrical ending makes this anything but clear.

Finally I must commend the makers of the DVD for including a full complement of bonus features, including deleted scenes, alternate endings, and director's commentary.

I get that. Heck, I'll even admit that I'm a sucker for them. So, when I heard about a found footage movie based on space, well, I was excited. Space is scary. We don't know what's going on out there. And, for a little bit, Apollo 18 did an amazing job at bringing that scariness to us. That is, until we see what's going on.

I'll be frank, Apollo 18 is bad. They do nothing to make us care about any of the characters, you won't even remember any of their names. The only thing they did right was the moral dillemmas they created. While watching the movie I kept thinking how stupid they were, how if it was me I would just kill him at the first sign of infection. Yet, when I really thought about it, I would've done the exact same thing as the character. It all goes back to my initial thought, space is scary. There's no one out there to save you if something goes wrong. That's the only thing they did right though. The ending was nothing short of aggrivating and I was so irritated at how dumb they were about everything.

It may just be me, but if I'm on the moon and weird stuff starts happening the last thing I would do is leave my lander and start investigating. Nevermind the fact that...

SPOILER ALERT

They found a Russian lander with blood in it and a dead astronaut. No way. I'd cash out and sit in my lander till I was radioed to leave. I would not keep having stuff happen to my equipment and think everything was okay.

4343766,1,B004EPYZXK,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did.

It's good for the first 30 minutes and then it's all down hill from there.  Seriously, the most entertaining parts of this movie are when they are in the ship and landing it and doing research and gathering the rocks.

And the villains of this movie?  Rocks with legs.  Seriously that's it, rocks with legs.  Plus they're about the size of a potato.  Really?  Something that I could just step on?  Good lord and if that wasn't bad enough, the camera work is just horrible!  I can't even see what's happening!  Stuff like that works for Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity because there is tension that is building and something is actually HAPPENING.  In this move there's nothing going on!

It's just these two guys saying: ""Did you hear that?""  ""What was that?""  ""Is there something outside?""

Plus what's even lamer is that toward the end when the one astronaut is running around looking for the other one he's doing it in the dark with a flash every 10 seconds or so and we briefly see rocks moving.  You mean to tell me that NOBODY at NASA thought to give their astronauts flashlights or lights on the outside of their space suits?

Another big complaint is that at one point the landing craft is rocked by something HUGE and we never see any creatures bigger than the potato sized ones.  So what was knocking the ship around?  Never explained.  Also, NOT ONCE does the movie show that there is less gravity on the moon than on Earth.  If you didn't look outside you'd swear they were just on Earth, they're walking around like normal, nothing is falling down slowly, it's just normal.

And the movie doesn't even TRY to tell the audience why they were up there to begin with.  Here, I can re-write the ending so it makes sense and the writer has an opportunity to give an explanation:

Astronaut: ""Okay Houston, look, I know I'm screwed I've come to terms with that.  But just level with me, what were we doing up here?""
Houston: ""Well since you're going to die and never speak to another human being again, here's why we sent you guys up there.."" *Insert explanation*

There, I wrote that in 30 seconds!  If I can do that, I would suspect that a Hollywood writer could do it!

How could astronauts have forgotten to bring a flashlight with them to the moon? The only thing they can do to see in the dark is use flashes. How lucky for the director - another good excuse to create a bad film. If this was made by a high school student for their graduation project I'd give it an A, but since it isn't I say shame on the director for not taking more care and pride in their work and settling for cheap gimmicks and tricks.

4343878,1,B004EPYZXK,"The Apollo 13 mission was a piece of cake compared to ""Apollo 18"". Taking the ""found footage"" and conspiracy theor to absurd extremes, the makers of ""Apollo 18"" propose that the space program continued AFTER Apollo 17 and a secret DOD mission was sent up to set up ICBM monitoring devices on the moon. There was one problem. The astronauts found out we aren't alone.

The film itself has plot holes big enough to fly the now retired space shuttle through and the film is all set up with very little in the way of plot development. The main flaw that dogs ALL found footage type of films also exists here--we really can't have much in the way of dramatic developments because we can't SEE everything that has happened outside the scope of the camera shooting the ""real"" drama. The film feels padded at a paltry 90 minutes and seems twice as long. The premise and execution might have worked well as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits"" but without any major plot developments over the course of 90 minutes (look their doing another EVA)the film feels 89 minutes too long.

There's the kernal of a good idea in ""Apollo 18"" but because of the execution and decision to shoot it as a ""found footage"" type of film, the plot isn't allowed to pop to life and fulfill its potential. ""Apollo 18"" would have worked much better as a science fiction or horror thriller shot like ""Alien"".

If you bought the Blu-ray for this you've wasted your money as the image quality is comparable to a standard DVD. The director does a nice job of mixing real NASA footage with the soundstage footage of the Apollo 18 crew exploring the surface of the moon but, honestly, the BD doesn't provide an improvement in image quality making it worth the extra expense.

Most of the special features aren't anything to radio home about either as they include an audio commentary with director Gonzalo L&oacute;pez-Gallego and editor Patrick Lussier, deleted and alternate scenes and alternate endings. I don't know that any special features would have improved the movie.

In the beginning, you are chewing your nails wondering what is happening. Honestly, in all of these outer space sci fi horror/suspense movies, I am usually disappointed with the outcome. This was no different. This movie could have been much better. When you find out the source of the suspense, it's kind of a let down. Then it goes from that to predictable. You can just see what's coming next & it does. Since most of this movie is grainy old film, Blu-Ray won't be much of an investment. What made this story sound good was that we all know & believe that the Dept of Defense would conduct secret missions, could send men to the moon or anywhere else without even their family knowing. This gave the basis of the movie, and the fact that it was going to be a space mission, a lot of potential. Eventually it just turns out to be another cheesy scifi movie.

I will give the movie credit with the fact that the creatures were scary, when you actually got to see them. I really hate to knock on this movie so hard, but I was totally disappointed with it. The Paranormal Activity movies are some of my favorite ""found footage"" movies, so I guess I was looking for more scenes that I could actually tell what was going on.

The premise is that a covert Apollo mission was launched in 1974 and that 3 astronauts were sent to the moon on the pretext of placing equipment on the lunar surface for monitoring purposes.  Upon landing, however, they discover the horrifying truth.
What makes APOLLO 18 work for me is its disturbing eeriness and impending sense of doom.  Also the vast immensity of being alone--the moon has never appeared more desolate and foreboding.  The videography is quite well done---it's claustrophobic but visually creative.  The crab-like creatures aren't shown very much but their sheer presence is ominous and unnerving.  Warren Christie and Lloyd Owen are excellent as the moon-bound heroes, and the inevitable conclusion quite chilling.

The guys on this mission have known each other for an extended period of time (training and such) so why would they take time out during a mission to ""get to know each other""?  Also you have to keep in mind that these supposed astronauts are just trying to survive, they are not stars in some blockbuster action flick, or reality show..

That kind of integrity shouldn't be overlooked, and it made for a few chilling scenes that would not have been possible if they had succumbed to the temptation to, say, introduce some new, ultra-secret technology we've never heard of, or given the actors more room to breathe, pun intended.  For examples that either aren't spoilers or were in the official trailer:  The sense of menace accomplished through context and posture of a space-suited American astronaut standing there and all you're hearing is his radio-carried voice; a climactic scare that comes to us directly from the laws of physics; a constant sense of claustrophobia when inside the spacecraft (particularly the orbiting Command Module); the hair-standing-on-end statement ""the flag is gone.""

If you're an Apollo nut, like I am, there are as I mentioned several things that are simply inconsistent with history or science, and you can easily choose to be aggravated by them, but honestly, they're easy to ignore in the story and setting and atmosphere (pun not intended).  There are a few just as troubling things about the alien monsters.  Again, to the extent you give the film demerits for these, please do grade it on a curve considering just about any other horror or science fiction movie, and I think you'll find it does ok.

I don't get the sense you're meant to leave this film convinced of the possibility of a worldwide government coverup of a nearby alien menace, and if you don't consider it a failure that it doesn't so convince you, you're apt to be entertained in the way quick little 1:20 scary stories are supposed to entertain.  It makes you chuckle, jump, try and will the characters to do and not do things, smile and wince, and darned if it doesn't feel more authentically like the moon than almost any other picture set there.",1324857600,,2408,4.8679706601467
4344310,4,B004EPYZXK,"You have to be able to deal with the very shaky hand-cam in this film; otherwise, it will bug you.

spoilers................

What will bug you even more though, and maybe give you nightmares, is the plethora of multi-legged creatures inhabiting the moon and infecting or killing people who land there.  And get this: the critters look like moon rocks most of the time, so there is no warning.

I should not have watched this right before I went to bed.",1324339200,,453,4.625
4344311,3,B004EPYZXK,"This film is OK for what it is:  a quickly made, cheap thriller that is supposed to be scientifically realistic.  It is made as if reconstructed from raw film footage into a story that at its best is compelling and believable.  Visually, it is successful in giving a you-are-there feel to the story, as the astronauts discover why they were sent there and what it all might mean.

Without playing the spoiler, the scientists are sent to the dark side of the moon in secret for the military, ostensively to set up a satellite observation system.  Not only do they discover that the USSR has been there first, but they find a number of mysterious observations of seemingly natural phenomena.  The astronauts on the ground begin to suspect that they are not being told the full story of why they are there, with tragic results.

In spite of the fact that none of the actors are well knowns, they do a very good job.  Indeed, they really look like straight-arrow, all-American types who believe in their country with a naive sincerity.  The team has real chemistry, from comraderie to coping with a deteriorating situation and crisis.  It is convincing and interesting, perhaps even moving to some.

I would recommend this to fans of hard scifi.  While the mystery - the limits of which are never fully explained - is a bit over the top, it is good enough.",1323129600,2,1352,4.6344537815126055

4344313,5,B004EPYZXK,"I loved the hell out of this movie when I saw it in the theatre. The audience seemed to enjoy it as well. I get it if some people aren't into it, if they are looking for more gore or are tired of the ""homemade movie genre"", but I found it to be intense, scary, and entertaining. I was talking about it for days afterwards, and really felt like that was a movie that was totally worthwhile. I'll be buying this for my permanent collection. It really is like ""Paranormal Activity in space"", but it's also great for all the conspiracy theory lovers out there as well - in terms of the truth about Apollo missions, extra terrestrial/gov knowledge, and what the gov would do to a team in space if they had encountered something. So...you're getting your sci-fi groove on as well as your horror groove. More like paranormal activity meets X-files meets Alien.  :)",1322265600,12,857,4.493589743589744
4344314,4,B004EPYZXK,"Okay, I just have to say from the start before I saw this movie I knew it'd be a ""B"" movie. We all knew that. But I am a huge fan of the ultra-creative horror picture of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and I think since this movie is very like that but almost a little better I think that this was a very creative and well done movie. People don't come into theaters anymore with an open mind and just not think about the movie and just enjoy the roller coaster ride for these kinds of movies.

The effects were amazing, the cinematography and the different camera shots were very well done, and the acting was much better than I thought, and the suspense and story was was great! I am amazed to how many people hated this movie...I found the movie pretty convincing as well...Even though it is fake it almost convinced me...",1321315200,,819,4.318181818181818
4344415,3,B004EPYZXK,"Saw this movie last weekend. This type of movie I really do not care for however, it was better than both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"".

4344416,4,B004EPYZXK,"This review contains the spoiler of telling you why they went to the moon, but not the ending.

The reason why no one knew about this mission was because it was top secret. 2 astronauts land on the moon near its south pole. The movie cleverly combines actual film footage of NASA with their own track over and their own film. They were careful enough to use side lighting to create the long shadows seen in the NASA films. I appreciate it when they do their homework. The cameras have been put in place. This avoids much of that sea sick motion you get from the other reality (translate:cheap) type movies.

Now the reason why they really went there was to check on the Russians who have landed a LEM (looks like a diving bell) on the moon. The crew was not informed about this so they really panicked when they found another set of footprints. What we know:

1)The Russian is dead, apparently killed.
2) There is a strange rock that seems to move on its own, but we don't see it move.
3) There is a strange crater/shaft made from different rock which is at the heart of the problem.
4) There are communication issues and there appears to be strange going-ons outside the LEM that suggests visitors.

Now I hate hand held reality movies. My finger is on the fast forward button more than a lab rat pressing for cheese. But this one held my interest. I wanted to see what was causing all the grief, even if it was just for a fleeting moment and later they did resort to the herky-jerky camera. I was too far along at the time. I wonder how this lines up with ""The Dark Side of the Moon?""",1320451200,3,1586,4.3120805369127515
4344417,3,B004EPYZXK,"""Houston, this is Liberty. Did you see anything unusual in Westinghouse last night?"" After the last ""official"" moon landing, Apollo 18 went up, but never came back. This is the story of that mission. Based on the preview for this movie I was not looking forward to this at all. A fake trip to the moon where they meet aliens...not my type of thing. After watching this I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I'm not saying this is an Oscar type movie, or that it can compare to Apollo 13 (because it is in no way close), but this in very enjoyable and entertaining. The whole thing is shot as a documentary the same way ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"" was where you only see and hear what the main characters do. That adds a little something to the movie and in this case actually helps the movie. This is one of the better Horror/Sci-Fi movies I have seen and am still in shock at how much I was entertained by this. It also may have helped that I went in expecting garbage. Overall, a surprisingly good movie that is entertaining and tense at times. I give it a B.

4344420,1,B004EPYZXK,"I went to see this movie the weekend it opened.  I had high hopes for it as the trailers and TV spots were pretty intense.  I love a good consipiracy theory and when it comes to space, I am in for almost any good flick.  This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The so called ""previously classified footage"" was so horribly done and so boring I found myself looking away from the screen out of boredom.  The story line was so thin the climax was laughable when you finally get what is going on up there.  By the time we got to about minute 50 of the movie two-thirds of the audience had gotten up and left the theater.  NASA backed out of any assistance in the making of this trainwreck and they actually need the publicity.

I know it is one man's opinion and I do encourage anyone to see it just so they can weigh in on how much they too wish they had kept their money.",1316736000,14,888,4.034285714285715
4344421,3,B004EPYZXK,"I can accept the ""found footage"" style cinematography.  The plot is is also new and contrary to most current Lunar Landing conspiracy theories out there so at least it's not the same old.  ""Capricorn One"" did that already in 1978.  My problem with the movie comes as the very end.  Spoiler alert:  Stop reading this if you plan on watching the movie.

The orbiter and the lander both did not make it back.  Everyone were killed.  So how did NASA get the video tapes back on Earth?  Apollo 19?  OMG!  Are they going to make a sequel?",1316476800,4,532,4.381443298969073

It looks as if you were watching an authentic recording of a moon mission gone very wrong. As everyone at this point knows, these movie endings are never good for the characters involved, and anyone expecting otherwise should not even bother to watch them.
I give this movie five stars because I really inmersed myself in the plot. The dark, isiolated, barren moonscape is incredibly well made, as well as the spaceships visual details and sounds. The acting was excellent, and the moon creatures convincing.",1316044800,110,683,4.896551724137931

I usually LOVE this kind of movies. Anything about astronauts stuck on other planets or the moon.
I saw ""Moon"" and thought was OK and after watching the previews for this one, I thought they were going to come up with something more exciting. They tried, but the ""actual footage"" is actually soooo boring. The plot could've been written by a 12yo. And the ""the bad things"" are just bad special effects.
I left the theater almost angry for spending my time watching this movie.
