3493857,5,B001BL6QGE,"They've done it!  They've created a DVD that's lively, fun, interactive with beautiful backgrounds (computer generated) and props!  My DD watches this one every day and dances just like a little princess ballerina lol!  I'm tempted to buy a spare in case something happens to ours!

If you wonder what the songs look like just watch the brand new season of TV episodes on TV because they are using the SAME songs as this.",1226016000,2,421,4.648648648648648
3493858,5,B001BL6QGE,"This is the best dvd with Sam thus far,in my opinion. The songs are catchy and get in your head(Sing a Song of Sixpence"", ""Over In The Meadow"").""Turkey in the Straw"" is fun with the turkey costume on Jeff,and comical dance moves. Sam's vocals are amazing,most notably in ""Black Velvet Band"",,""Rock a Bye Baby""(that's his wife Lyn he's dancing with),and ""Over in the Meadow"".The costumes are elaborate and beautiful,and Captain Feathersword makes an amusing Humpty Dumpty. This video is very entertaining,from my perspective. My children have pretty much outgrown the Wiggles,but I still buy their dvd's for myself,because they're THAT good!",1223942400,16,640,5.346534653465347
3493859,5,B001BL6QGE,"The DVD is only about 48min of play time, which is short.  But when finished it only cycles through one intro song before replaying.  That is perfect.  So it can run over a couple of times during our meal time with out a press of button.

This DVD is slower on energy, but really draws the attention of my 10 month son. He will watch and eat a full meal with no fuss.

Truely a great one!!  Thank you Wiggles, we need more DVD's like this one with Sam!",1223856000,12,452,4.022471910112359
3493860,5,B001BL6QGE,"The movie was a little slow in the middle with all of the nursery rhymes, but my daughter still loved it!  At the end is a short clip from a live show.  We saw the Wiggles live recently.  Seeing the show again just thrilled my daughter!",1223769600,4,236,4.086956521739131
3493861,5,B001BL6QGE,My son is speech delayed and rarely says anything unprompted. He loves this DVD. He sat and watched it quietly a few times and then began to try and move his mouth. Now he's approximating the language in the songs. The pace and variety on the DVD gives him a lot to work with. We watch it every day and everyday he improves.,1408579200,,324,4.158730158730159
3493862,5,B001BL6QGE,These are movies for my son . He Loves them all and watches them all the time . Very Nice,1395532800,,89,3.5
3493863,5,B001BL6QGE,"The Wiggles bring our favorite nursery rhymes to life like no-one else can. A cheerful, fun, musical interlude for kids. Highly recommended....",1390262400,,143,5.545454545454546
3493864,5,B001BL6QGE,We love this DVD. It has such great toddler Wiggles dancing music that the parents love so much. We don't mind our 3 yr old don wanting to play it over and over.,1389484800,,161,3.909090909090909
3493865,5,B001BL6QGE,I bought this to entertain my 9 month old son on a long plane ride.  He loved it!  It bought me a lot of peace and quiet on the plane.  He is 11 months old now and a huge Wiggles fan.  He likes this video so much that every time he sees my Kindle Fire he fusses until I put this video on for him.,1350259200,,296,3.5076923076923077
3493866,5,B001BL6QGE,"I was looking for a good nursery rhymes DVD for my 5 month old daughter so she could get used to music. I had not heard of The Wiggles before but they were the only nursery rhymes DVD I could find in all the places that I searched.  I must say, that was my best buy ever!!!!!! She loved it! and so did I! My whole family has the songs memorized. She is 1+ now and does not sit still but The Wiggles are the only thing that can keep her in one place! It makes feeding her really easy too. This DVD and Pop Go The Wiggles are her favs. She does not enjoy the old school Wiggles (w the diff yellow wiggle) so much. She asks me to change it!",1350172800,,637,3.8257575757575757
3493867,3,B001BL6QGE,Yawwwwn..if this dvd was made to put kids to sleep then it serves its purpose.. the songs r so slow! The only reason i gave it some stars is because it keeps my daughter entertained for a good fifteen min.,1343433600,,205,4.15
3493868,5,B001BL6QGE,"Love this DVD, this was our first Wiggles DVD purchase and we are so happy we got it. It says that it's for 1+ and we got it for my son's first birthday- now there's not much that can keep a 12 month old sitting for more than about 2 minutes but as soon as this DVD starts, he freezes and will sit and watch it for 20 minutes. We have the songs in our head all the time and he seems to really enjoy it, so I would highly recommend it!",1308268800,,434,3.7282608695652173
3493869,5,B001BL6QGE,What can you say about the Wiggles?  They are so fun and get both Grandkids and Grandparents up moving!,1289952000,,103,4.421052631578948
3493870,1,B001BL6QGE,The DVD worked fine for about 1 week and now skips.  Waste of money!,1255305600,,68,3.857142857142857
3493871,5,B001BL6QGE,"My 11 month old daughter really enjoys this DVD, and so do I! I have to say that I am very impressed with the updated musical arrangements of the songs, and I love the fact that if I get a song stuck in my head it's actually not embarrassing! I highly recommend this for toddler/preschoolers as well, since they will recognize almost all of the songs.",1249257600,,351,4.333333333333333
3493872,5,B001BL6QGE,"After looking at the other great feedback online I decided to buy this one from the wiggles for my 18 month old (she was 15 mos at the time). I had already bought Pop Goes the Wiggles and she absolutely loved it. I must say I was definitely NOT dissappointed in this one either. If your child is a big fan of the Wiggles and just dancing and singing, then he/she will love this one. The nursery rhymes were well sung and acted out with costumes and lots of dancing(quite a lot of ballet moves which I'm sure your little princesses will love)and my daughter sits through both of these Wiggles nursery rhymes DVD all the way to the end. Sam Moran's voice is very soothing, Jeff and the Captain are as silly as ever, Anthony and Murray are just fantastic and the Wiggles dancers/singers and Dorothy all deliver in this one as well!!! Parents you will also enjoy seeing all the Wiggles cast as babies in the end credits, very cute!!!
I definitely don't regret this purchase!! If you are a fan of the Wiggles, this is a must have for your child's collection.
Here are a few of the songs my daughter enjoys:

""Over in the Meadow"" (sung beautifully by Sam and acted out by the dancers)
""What are little boys/girls made of"" (Two separate versions for boys and girls)
""Old McDonald"" (with Old McDonald beautifully played Jeff)
""Sing a song of sixpense""
""Rock A Bye Baby"" (nicely sung by Sam and his wife with an adoring little baby)
""Hot Cross Buns""
""I'm a Little Teapot""
""Black velvet band""
and many more....",1244419200,8,1500,4.474452554744525
3493873,5,B001BL6QGE,My 18 month old baby loves this DVD.... The wiggles are a jolly bunch and very entertaining. My baby loves this DVD as it has many of the rhymes that she is familiar with.. I am very happy with this purchase.,1244073600,,208,4.097560975609756
3493874,3,B001BL6QGE,"My daughter love the Wiggles. I mean LOVES them, but the newer DVDs don't interest her. She rather watch the cheezy old school Wiggles with the children dancing with the t-shirt clad Wiggles in a poorly designed studio than the newer DVDs with the all the computer generated backgrounds, professional dancers and glitzy costumes.",1243555200,3,329,5.111111111111111
3493875,3,B001BL6QGE,This one'll put your kid to sleep for sure. It did me. LOL Too much Anthony and those new big white teeth he got a few years ago. Need more Jeff or even Murray and his guitar. Greg left a huge void and it's obvious they are struggling to come up with a concept that will work. Sam is a nice guy with a fabulous voice but he lacks Greg's stage presence. The new Wiggles have forgotten how to wiggle. All that ballet is a trifle boring.,1238976000,,434,4.0
3493876,5,B001BL6QGE,This DVD is awesome. My 2 yr. old daughter loves to watch it again and again. She is the type who normally gets bored soon but this is one DVD she has made an exception for. The music is very very good and has been picturised very well. We parents love it too.,1237680000,7,260,3.9245283018867925
3493877,5,B001BL6QGE,"My 5 and almost 3 year old love boys love this DVD, the songs are catchy and the music is great.  This is our first Wiggles DVD, but we have a couple CDs, some old some new.  We haven't been Wiggles fans long enough to think nothing can compare to Greg, we enjoy both singers equally.  I think Sam and crew did a fantastic job on this, his voice is perfect for the songs!  I enjoy listening to this DVD, several upbeat songs (""sing a song of sixpense"" and ""over in the meadow"" are my two favorites, catchy and upbeat versions).  There's a slower song (""black velvet band"") in the middle which the kids didn't care for at the beginning but now they actually pay to the story it's telling.  They both cackle when humpty dumpty falls down too (typical boys!). Great DVD worth adding to your Wiggles or children's collection!",1235520000,2,821,4.403973509933775
3493878,4,B001BL6QGE,"This is a mellow sweet dvd with the wiggles singing classic lullabies.  Most of the scenes are castles and old times' houses.  Colors are soft watercolor like, instead of the traditional primary colors of the wiggles.  Some of the actresses and dancers are their wives which I think it's sweet but the princesses are not, well, not young.  My little girl likes to watch it, but she won't get up and dance like she does with her other wiggles videos.  We use it to calm her down.  The wiggles wear lots of costumes so she doesn't think it's ""the wiggles"", she still requests her wiggles video to dance and jump.",1233273600,,610,4.5
3493879,4,B001BL6QGE,"It is a little slower than most Wiggles songs we were used to so my 3 year old wasn't a fan, but my 1 1/2 year old didn't seem to mind.",1232668800,,135,3.3870967741935485
3493880,3,B001BL6QGE,"I feel my son is a little disappointed with this DVD. He is a big fan and has all Wiggles toys and almost all DVDs. The previous DVD was a big success and he loved so I assumed this one was going to be as good. Unfortunately, it is not. The music is just not exciting, the dances are not very entertaining. Let's face it, the Wiggles are getting old...",1230249600,,352,4.042857142857143
