7848917,2,630351152X,"...because this one is a real howler.  Our boy Frank Zagarino is an ex-military man who is presumed dead and now working as a boat repairman in some swampy little backwater town.  He is inadvertently roped into action again when his old whack-job commander (played by the guy who was John Bly in ""Brisco County Jr.""), who now heads a truly stupid looking cult of Heaven's Gate imitators, takes a state official's daughter hostage and terrorizes the town.  Will Frank be able to save the day?  Will he ever change facial expressions?  Who invented liquid soap and why?  (Yes, no, and dunno.)

As an action movie, this fails on all accounts.  It is painfully obvious when the punches and kicks are being faked (which is pretty much all the time), and the plot is just plain silly.  In addition, there are numerous goofs:  Frank gets soaked to the skin and then is miraculously dry in the very next scene; motorboats perform feats that no regular motorboats would ever be capable of (particularly not when loaded down with people and weapons!); and Frank once again defies all logic by running from one end of the town to the other faster than the cops can drive!  Not to mention the fact that he seems to be wearing a scoopneck while performing all of these death-defying stunts...

As stated above, if you love making fun of bad movies 'MST3K'-style, then crack open a few beers, invite some friends over, and stick this puppy in.  You'll be snortin' suds out your nose sometime before the end credits roll, I promise you.  Everyone else, steer clear and just rent ""Die Hard"" again.",1140048000,,1581,4.6606498194945845
