1714835,4,B000067G10,"Back in 1969, Rock music still belonged to the Rock generation. It was rarely seen in movies or on television. The place for Rock - especially ""live"" Rock - was in a Concert Hall, a Club, on radio. True, there were national TV series like ""American Bandstand"", ""Shindig"", ""Hullabaloo"", etc., where you could see artists perform live or lip-sync, but the big difference was that an interview with the artist was fairly short - no more than a minute or so following or prefacing a song. With the Late Night Talk Show Explosion of the late '60s, early '70s, more and more Rock acts were seen in extended talking segments sitting alongside the stand-by show-biz personalities.
Ofcourse, Mike Douglas always had Rock and Soul, Jazz, and Country artists on his afternoon show since the early '60s, but the late evening scene was still uncharted by most of the big names in Rock.
Jimi Hendrix made his national TV debut on the Dick Cavett Show in July of 1969 (he had made local appearances earlier in the decade, notably with Little Richard's group, The Upsetters).
Cavett, from Johnny Carson's home state of Nebraska and now a member of the New York intelligensia, struggled to mix sardonic social commentary into the confab, and managed to get in a few interesting questions which Hendrix responded to with style and insight. The result is fascinating in that although Hendrix never lets the host use him as a second banana he shows respect and understanding. But as interesting as parts of the discussion are, the real significant feature is the music, and we get ""Isabella"" with Jimi and the *studio band*! Bob Rosengarden plays decent Hard Rock drums and the result is actually quite good. Hendrix seems to be enjoying the whole scene.
The second appearance was scheduled immediately following the Woodstock Festival and Hendrix's schedule had been adjusted to where the Cavett Show couldn't fit in. The third shot finally came about two months later and included the Experience. By this time, the road, the money problems, the creative process had taken it's toll. He was exhausted and he said so on the show.
In an interview prepared for this videocassette Dick Cavett reflects on his own ""Experience"" with the Experience. The most interesting comment is about the ""Star Spangled Banner"" performance at Woodstock and his feeling that, in consideration of the tense times, he should add a kind of disclaimer for the more (pause) ""conservative"" audience members - don't forget, folks, this guy was a Paratrooper!
Cavett seems to believe he never acted in a condescending way to this *unusual* musician, but the actual tape has him commenting about Jimi's far-out shirt.
Overall, however, Dick Cavett handled the proceedings well, but the best interviewer of flambouyant Rockers remains Mr. Mike Douglas.
Drummer Mitch Mitchell and Bassist Bobby Cox are among the present day commentators.",1021680000,4,2887,5.004158004158004
1714836,5,B000067G10,"The Dick Cavett Show (W/ Jimi Hendrix) is a DVD that celebrates Hendrix's appearance on the famed talk show.
The first part of the DVD compliles Hendrix's 2 appearances on the Dick Cavett show (7/69 and 9/69) in their entirety (including Cavett's opening Monologue on both shows).  This does not count though the other guests' interviews, just the one's featuring Hendrix (along with musical performances).
The second part of the DVD contains a 60 minute documentary covering these legendary appearances as well as mention of the Woodstock performance, and Dick Cavett's show that appeared on August 18, 1969 with some performers from the festival.  Interviews with Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Cavett, Juma Sulton, and Cavett's band member, are provided to compliment the footage from the Cavett show (much of it shown like in the above mentioned area).
Not much revelation as far as the interviews in the documentary go - apart from Dick Cavett's views of Hendrix as a guest.  But the archival footage is priceless!  Great quality also!
Definately recommended for the diehard Hendrix fan!",1021680000,10,1088,5.1647727272727275
1714837,5,B000067G10,"I saw the original 8/69 show and seeing this DVD took me right back to that summer night. The video transfer is really crisp, and the sound is too. Both shows were out on bootleg video, most were of high generation, so the image was fuzzy to say the least.
The DVD features comments from Dick Cavett and members of Jimi's band, Billy Cox, Mitch Mitchell and Juma. But, the star of the show is Jimi Hendrix. Cavett's show was Jimi's first network appearance, and you could tell Jimi was having fun. A lot of us really miss him.",1021420800,7,526,4.3232323232323235
1714858,4,B000067G10,"Essential rock-video history as Jimi Hendrix makes his American television debut on ""The Dick Cavett Show."" Though the DVD does not include the complete Cavett broadcasts, it showcases both Hendrix appearances in 1969 - sparked by live renditions of ""Izabella,"" ""Hear My Train A-Comin"" and ""Machine Gun."" Along with the legendary guitarist's handwritten notes, the disc includes a somewhat repetitive 53-minute documentary featuring present-day interviews with Cavett, drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Billy Cox. Ideal viewing for classic-rock aficionados.",1271203200,2,558,6.075949367088608
1714859,5,B000067G10,"I think it's a great dvd but the really reason Im writing is
How come I never get Dick Cavett. He can't interview or talk worth poop.
He seems like a nervous arrogant prick who like stuck in college",1233532800,,198,4.102564102564102
1714860,2,B000067G10,I thought this DVD was a little drawn out with interviews from people that new Jimi other then himself and very little performance.,1232755200,2,131,4.739130434782608
1714861,1,B000067G10,"Theres hardly any Jimi Hendrix in this. I think except for the three songs theres maybe 2 full minutes of Hendrix on this. How sad, they should of teamed up with 'someone' else and tried to make a real special DVD. One thing I learned about Hendrix was how photogenic he could be on a set.",1190678400,,289,4.178571428571429
1714862,4,B000067G10,"Being a rock icon in the 60s or 70s was very different from what it is today.  Here is Jimi, smart, funny, humble and articulate.  More inspiration in his little finger than a truckload of angry rappers.

Even his playing came from a different place than today's super guitarists.  Nowadays, to play in Jimi's league means spectacular technique--as if someone is giving a test.  But Jimi's ability was intrinsic; all he had to do was play what he heard and felt.  And what he heard and felt was as cool as it gets.",1142812800,11,514,4.473118279569892
1714863,1,B000067G10,I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.,1138147200,8,455,4.62962962962963
1714864,1,B000067G10,"If you add up all of the interview footage of Hendrix, there's not much here. Dick Cavett did not interview Hendrix, he just made comments about how he liked his shirt and and threw in a few funny remarks. The Cavett people had to release this for it's historic value to Rock music, but Mr. Cavett and crew must regret not having more in depth content to offer us 35 years later.

Cavet did not convey to the viewers the importance of the times. There were no in depth questions at all about Woodstock which is hindsight is almost criminal, given that the story lead the evening news with Walter Cronkite. When Hendrix mentions that he he has had three nervous breakdowns, Cavett fails to make a folow up question. The most amazing part of the DVD is when Cavett breaks for a commercial, and Hendrix has left the studio. Cavett explains to his audience that Jimmi is too tired to complete the interview.

The conclusion of the DVD offers a series of present day interviews from Cavvet, to Jimmi's original drummer and Bass guitar player. All of these interviews are interupted every 30 seconds by replays of the interview we just watched.

Borrow this from a friend, or rent it. Don't buy it. This DVD has thirty minutes of content in it, including the music performed by Jimmi on the show.",1136592000,24,1290,4.551724137931035
1714865,5,B000067G10,"Think all rock stars are full of themselves, media slick and savvy, arrogant, self-promoting, know-it-alls? Think again. Jimi Hendrix comes across in these interviews as a humble and gentle man, a surprisingly sweet person in the rough and tumble, hedonistic world of rock music. I was expecting the stereotypical, obnoxious rock star. Hendrix has the softspoken, peaceful demeanor of an earnest divinity student or shy artist. He is non-materialistic and quietly laments that there is way too much money in the music world. When Cavett tells Hendrix that he is one of the greatest guitarists in the world, Hendrix appears embarassed and sincerely qualifies that statement and seems to mean it. The great Jimi Hendrix exemplifying the virtues of modesty and humility? It is so unexpected. Would that today's rap thugs, pop tart bimbos, and spoilt rock acts learned a few things from him. He admits to making mistakes when he plays guitar. He is visibly exhausted in one interview and does his gentlemanly best to be gracious while anyone else would have cancelled the interview or been impatient. Where did all of that guitar genius come from? How could such a gentle and sensitive man be such a powerhouse of rock music? To listen to his music, one would expect someone very different. When Hendrix picks up his guitar and plays unaccompanied with a small amp on Cavett's show, he becomes a man transfixed. Clearly, playing guitar and singing was this man's spiritual and emotional outlet. Very interesting dvd.",1125792000,59,1512,5.052
1714866,3,B000067G10,I collected alot of Hendrix material I had seen bits and pieces of The Dick Cavett Show on earlier releases but never thought they would actually release it on DVD. Experience Hendrix did release this on DVD and I bought it the day they came out with it. I was kind of disapointed I mean come on...... this DVD is really all interviews with Dick Cavett and the hendrix performence is O.K........still worth a buy for a Hendrix collector. I think this DVD is is worth 3 stars and I know any true hendrix fan would love this DVD but if your looking for a real good hendrix DVD try looking at The Isle Of Wight Festival. I do still watch the Dick Cavett Show with Jimi Hendrix and I really do enjoy the material they included on this DVD. Enjoy!,1094688000,10,742,4.2695035460992905
1714867,4,B000067G10,"That's Billy, not Bobby, Cox, Jimi's bass player from the Band of Gypsys phase.
Great stuff, seeing 'freaky' Hendrix outwitting 'straight' Cavett. Tho I sometimes wonder if they worked that out together in advance. If not, then this shows Hendrix was just as quick verbally as with a Stratocaster ...",1077235200,,300,5.02
1714878,3,B000067G10,"The Jimi Hendrix Dick Cavett Show is of course very short. But still the DVD gives you the full performence of Jimi Hendrix at the Dick Caveet show which is also very short I think Hendrix only plays like 2 songs Izabella, and Hear My Train A Comin. Experience Hendrix provides as much as they can Experience Hendrix does just want to cash in for the money. I don't wacth this DVD that much because its very short and to me Hendrix isn't really trying to play on this cause he was very tired from other shows and concerts. I rated this a 3 if your a Hendrix fan then you prob. would like to see this short film. If your not then don't even think about buying this!!!!!",1068163200,6,668,4.186046511627907
1714879,5,B000067G10,"....everything he says. Very introspective and gifted man. As photographer Jim Marshall said: ""He had more talent, more energy, and more sex appeal than any one man has a right to."" We are even treated to a performance of him playing his three pickup White SG Les Paul Custom from the September 9th show. Well worth it for any Hendrix fan.
One thing: The photo on the front cover is from the Newport Pop Festival (Devonshire Downs 22ndJune1969) and NOT from the Cavett shows! (Anyone notice the Telecaster neck on his Stratocaster?) And why doesn't anyone ever give Juma Sultan any credit?

1714880,3,B000067G10,"For decades I've read and heard about Hendrix' appearance on the long cancelled Dick Cavett Show. I vaguely remember the show when I was a child, and used to watch it in the early '70s. Later in life, when I rabidly embraced Jimi's guitar wizardry and began obsessively collecting anything and everything I could, I longed for this footage. I bumped into this DVD release in an FYE about a year ago and immediately snapped it up.
What impressed me first was the nostalgic value of the shows.  They don't just give you Hendrix' appearances, they give you the entire show, minus the presence of other guests. I mean, the opening, Cavett's monolog, the interview and/or performance, and the show's close. It gives you a real feel for the times. For those that lived through that era and remember the show, it's a real flashback!
Also, the quality of the footage is spectacular! It's almost as though you're watching it aired live for the first time.
For any Hendrix fanatic, this is a must have. For the person who's curious about the man, you will catch a glimpse of the real Jimi, but only under the context of lights and cameras. Jimi was a shy man when interviewed for live broadcast. Get him on stage and it's a whole different story.
I would not suggest this disk for his performance, if you're new to Jimi or just a casual fan. Jimi appears with the show's big band, but only with a small amp and guitar, no pedals. He satisfies his spot on the show but doesn't perform anything that outstanding.
It's well put-together and an interesting watch.  I would have loved to see bundled with this release his appearance on the Tonight Show, where he also played with the big band.  Perhaps that'll be released separately at a later date.",1062633600,73,1735,4.590322580645161

Way, way past his prime, Cavett looks and sounds feeble; the short Hendrix performances and interviews are the only real draws here. Although this may be just one additional opportunity for the Hendrix family to finally ""cash-in,"" we can, nonetheless enjoy it too.

1714886,4,B000067G10,"This is a fascinating glimpse of the real Jimi Hendrix in his traumatic last days. It's sad that James Marshall Hendrix's drug use is so obvious to everyone here for example.
Cavett-What do you do when you get up in the morning?
Hendrix-I try to get up every morning (audience laughs).
Hendrix also gets into some spacey raps about the message of his music. Mightly weird stuff, but it's a fascinating glimpse of the man. But the music is the thing here. What's really nice is the way Hendrix and co. blend ""Izabella"" into ""Machine Gun.""
Tragically, we all know what happened to Jimi one year after this  episode.
While it's very interesting to watch as a whole, parents might wanna show this to their kids as a warning about the dangers of drug abuse.",1023753600,3,752,4.57037037037037
1714887,2,B000067G10,"First let me say I love Hendrix and I really did enjoy what's here....
BUT...
There's really not much content to this disc....it's basically his two cavett appearances, which aren't his two best live performances by a long shot and a ""documentary"" of which 80% is those two same appearances....
Let's be honest this disc might really be for hardcore Hendrix junkies only....I am one so I liked it, and I always love listening to him talk....but I think most folks would feel there's far too little actual content...
Why not put ALL of Hendrix's television appearances on a DVD ? I'm sure they'd all fit on one....let's hope Experience Hendrix does better then this in the future...Hendrix at Monterey, Hendrix at Berkley, Royal Albert Hall, the remastered Isle of Wight, the rest of Hendrix on TV...where is it?

Once you watch it, it doesn't bare repeated viewing like other concert DVDs and footage.  Still, to catch a glimpse of Jimi in an informal setting is pretty darn cool.  Worth the price of admission, but should have a bit more 'meat' to it.  I'll bet there is a box of outtakes that someone will repackage and sell this with somewhere in the future.

 Dick is the best talk show host. It seems that Dick was one of many  great hosts over time, that were not square enough to be allowed to stay on the air. Henasked reasonable questions. He brought on the hard-to-book guests, a testament to the trust others had in him. He would own Leno in a heartbeat, yes now! (YES..this IS another tragic subject, I know. But Dick is still ariund, still vibrant..we need him to come back..funny, clever, smart).
OK, ok, back to Jimi.  I -so love hearing him laugh (without a care).
Being able to see his personality  in a more relaxed setting, -is really cool.
In these few nites with Cavett, priceless.  There are very few video interviews, or really any interviews at all. Other than these rare 'tapes.'  He pkSo for a fan, its a nice addition.

The DVD is : The Authorized Hendrix Family Edition. (...and?)

The sticker on this states: Bonus Features include the original programs in their full length with Cavett's opening monologues and original commercials.

The programs are NOT in their full length. There are NO original commercials. There was on end tag when the credits rolled on episode one stating what product sponsored the show. NO OTHER COMMERCIALS!

I do not see one thing different from this and the first release but the plastic case size (this is the size of a Blue-Ray case) and the picture on the DVD is different. The writing on the back of the DVD is the same except the one photo missing from the original release is now inside the new DVD release.

Also the NEW DVD release has added 5 minutes to the Behind The Scenes Documentary.

I only bought this for $10.99 but feel ripped off. If they just had the original commercials included like it says on the outside sticker. I see nothing different from the shows on either disc. The Old Release even has a subtitle feature the New disc doesn't.

Save Your money THIS is the same program as the Older release. If I am wrong please tell me what I missed just now watching them back to back?",1316390400,11,1290,4.510729613733906
