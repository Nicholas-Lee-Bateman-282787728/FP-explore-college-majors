1370786,4,B00004Y6BF,"The main reason I purchased the movie Cockfighter (1974) aka Born to Kill aka Gamblin' Man aka Wild Drifter was because I'm a big fan of the crazy-eyed Warren Oates (Dillinger, Dixie Dynamite).  As far as director Monte Hellman goes, the only other film of his I've seen, up until this one, has been the 1974 Hammer film Shatter, which wasn't really all that good, but in his defense, he was uncredited for his work there, so it's difficult to say how much involvement he had in that film.  I am interested in seeing the film he's primarily known for, Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), but I am unwilling to pay the outrageously overblown prices being asked by gougers for the now out of print DVDs.  Hopefully Anchor Bay Entertainment will see fit to re-release this film sometime in the future.  Also appearing with Oates is Richard B. Shull (The Big Bus, Splash), Harry Dean Stanton (Kelly's Heroes, Repo Man), Ed Begley Jr. (She-Devil), Laurie Bird (Two-Lane Blacktop), Troy `You may remember me from such films as' Donahue (Monster on the Campus, A Summer Place), Warren Finnerty (The Panic in Needle Park), Robert Earl Jones, father of the man who did the voice of Darth Vader (James Earl Jones), Patricia Pearcy (Squirm), Millie Perkins (The Diary of Anne Frank), and the slightly enigmatic (and highly kooky) Steve Railsback, who scared the hell out of many a viewer with his disturbingly realistic portrayal of serial killer Charles Manson in the 1977 made-for-TV film Helter Skelter.

As the film begins we meet Frank Mansfield (Oates), a game fowl trainer, who is trying to rebuild his career on the cockfight circuit after a devastating loss in a previous finals tournament where he, in effect, shot off his mouth and ended up losing big...actually, he never even got to make a showing in the tournament as he lost his prize bird during a unscheduled fight.  Subsequently he made a vow to himself that he would not speak until he won the prestigious cockfighter of the year medal (no foolin').  Anyway, after a loss that forces him to give up his car, mobile home, and his girlfriend, Frank returns to his home to regroup.  Turns out Frank has a fiance of sorts, and she's putting the pressure on him to tie the knot, but he's got to go forward with his career (no time for love, Dr. Jones...) and does so appropriating the needed funds through some creative home financing, along with taking on a partner.  With gamecock in hand, Frank begins to rise to the top, eventually making it to the southern conference finals, which are being held at the governors' mansion (?!)  Will Frank take the big tamale?  I'm not going to say, but I will say that many chickens were hurt during the making of this movie, so if you are unable to stomach chicken on chicken violence, steer clear...

This wasn't a particularly pleasant film (in terms of the graphic, authentic nature of some of the scenes), but I did learn a number of things...like roosters are very ugly creatures, but that doesn't mean they should be pitted against each other for entertainment purposes.  I also learned cockfighting isn't just throwing two birds in a ring and watching them go at it...it's a sport...a vile blood sport, yes, but a sport, one involving training (much like a prizefighter training for a bout), rules, an actual fighting circuit, and dirty tricks galore.  The interesting thing about a film like this is it allows the viewer to enter a world they would not normally get to see...and it doesn't seem to glorify the `sport', but use it as a backdrop to tell a story...a controversial backdrop, certainly.  There was a whole lot of fighting in the film, but it was shot in such a way as to not overshadow the story and the characters.  I had a bit of trepidation when I learned Oates' character didn't speak throughout the film (he did have some voiceover representing inner monologue) but he and director Hellman did very well having his restlessly obsessive, even sensitive character communicating through other means (his own form of sign language or pad and paper, for example) as he tries to not only redeem himself, but also to reconcile his personal and professional lives.  As I said before, I've been a fan of Warren Oates for a long time...he just seemed like such a unique personality, much like his co-star Harry Dean Stanton.  Neither man is, or was, particularly handsome, but they always managed to bring a realistic quality to their characters, almost instantly adding a level of credibility.  There were some truly, absurdly funny moments in the film like when one particular competition gets shut down due to pressures from the SPCA, so the men decide to continue on within the hotel rooms.  One fellow asks what they are going to do with the dead birds, and the promoter responds by telling him they'll stack them in the bathtub...for some reason, I don't see these guys being welcomed back to this hotel anytime soon.  Another great scene involves a character played by Ed Begley Jr., a sort of goony backwoods, overall wearing type who, with his fighter Lil' Joe, challenge Frank to a private match...one thing that surprised me more than anything else was the fact this was a film produced by Roger Corman...I'm not that he didn't make good movies or anything like that, but there's just a lot more depth here than one would have expected for his usual fare...also, let's face it, on a superficial level this film would appeal to a fairly selective audience (certainly not Corman's style), with, perhaps, the exception of those who don't mind getting a little dirty for the sake of getting to witness a better than average story...all in all, an excellent story with strong characters...and some cockfighting...

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a very good-looking widescreen (1.77:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, print on this DVD (there is some grain), along with very decent Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio track.  There are a number of special features including a TV spot, two radio spots, talent bios, an audio commentary tracks with director Hellman and production assistant Steven Gaydos, moderated by Dennis Bartok, along with a 54 minute featurette titled Warren Oates: Across the Border, which features a number of writers, directors, family members, and stars (Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Culp, Stacy Keach, Ned Beatty, Peter Fonda), all waxing poetic about Oates and his life...not a bad piece, but it could have used a bit more depth.  Also included is a 5x7 Theatrical Poster Replica within the DVD case.

1370787,4,B00004Y6BF,"While the film makers goal may not have been to expose just how cruel the world of cockfighting is, he achieved that aim anyway.  This film does not gloss over the realities of the bloodsport.  Additionally, the script writers did an excellent job in learning the lingo cockfighters use.

1370789,5,B00004Y6BF,"Cockfighter was set up and then marketed as a low budget exploitation film, but was turned into a somewhat existential comic character study by director Monte Hellman with just enough elements for Roger Corman to market it as an exploitation film (some violence, controversy, and a bit of nudity).
Most people have not heard of 1974's Cockfighter.  It bombed at the box-office and is too quirky a film about too violent and controversial a sport to be widely embraced.
It's time for you to discover this gem of a film, which through some odd alignment of the stars has been given a red carpet type of DVD release by Anchor Bay, which includes a few extras.
It's time to shout from the mountain-tops and let all film buffs, Warren Oates fans, 70's movie lovers , appreciators of quirky cinema concoctions and cult film aficionados know there is an excellent film out there that you probably have not seen that is worth adding to your collection as soon as possible.
The film is based on a novel written by the late great Charles Willeford who also co-wrote the screenplay and plays an important supporting role in the film. Willeford's books have been the basis for a few other good quirky films like Miami Blues and the recent The Woman-Chaser.
Cockfighter is set in the world where fighting cocks are bred, trained and pitted against each other for spectators and gamblers to enjoy, but is focused on Frank Mansfield (Warren Oates) a
Man who has devoted his life to being the best Cockfighter on the circuit.  He is willing to risk everything and anything in pursuit of his goal-- a medal.  In fact because Frank Mansfield ws too cocky a few years ago, he wound up ruining his chances for the Cockfighter of the year medal.  So he took a vow of silence.  He would not talk ever again until he won the Cockfighter of the Year medal.  It's an ironic vow of silence because fighting Cocks rarely make noise as they fight to the death in the pit.
We are immersed in Frank's world and watch him lose a cockfight to his old adversary Jack (Harry Dean Stanton) that costs him his motor home trailer and current girlfriend Laurie Bird (previously seen in Two-Lane Blacktop) .
He returns to his hometown, and re-acquaints himself with his old girlfriend, Mary Elizabeth (Patricia Pearcy).  Mary Elizabeth would prefer marrying Frank than another suitor but doesn't consider Cockfighting a real profession and needs Frank to give it up.  Our mute hero isn't about to give up his obsession and hooks up with a new partner, Omar (Richard B. Shull), a new attitude and some new fighting cocks to try again to win the coveted Cockfighter of the year medal.  The adventures are unique and the world of this sport is not one you'll likely see portrayed in a film every again.
The violent sport is illegal and cruel to animals and this film doesn't flinch in showing the sport for what it is.  Animals were killed in the making of the movie, but they were animals destined to be killed in Cockfights.  The film was made on location and the crowd extras were made up of fans and participants in the sport.  Also in the film are Troy Donahue, Millie Perkins, Robert Earl Jones (Father of James Earl Jones), Ed Begley Junior and Steve (Helter Skelter, Stuntman)Railsback.
Although Oates plays a man who is silent through 99 percent of the film, he delivers one of his finest performances and also does the voice-over narration.  Just for Oates performance alone the film is very much worth seeing, but it's also a unique very well done film.  Despite the low budget, cinematographer Nestor Almandros creates a few memorable shots while accommodating Hellman's style which uses many master shots and long takes.  Nestor's lighting design accommodated Hellman's style.  Some rules are broken to great effect such as when a lake background is too hot and serves as the perfect background for a love scene between Oates and Mary Elizabeth.  The film has such a strong documentary verite' we can usually forget we are watching actors.  In fact there are so many non-actors in the film, Hellman considers half the film a documentary anyway.
Director Monte Hellman's career started with Corman on 1959's Beast from the Haunted Cave.  Hellman made two odd low budget westerns with Nicholson in the late 60's, Ride the Whirlwind and the existentially fascinating; The Shooting.  The Shooting also marked the first time Hellman worked with Oates.  Two directors; Sam Peckinpah and Monte Hellman utilized Oates best.  He made The Shooting, Two Lane Blacktop, Cockfighter and China 9 Liberty 37 with Oates.  They worked well together.  Perhaps their finest collaboration is Cockfighter.
The DVD presents the film better than it's ever been seen before. It's still a low budget film and there's grain and some soft focus but an excellent damage free print was used for the anamorphic digital transfer.
Lots of extras including one of the best commentary tracks you'll hear on DVD make this one worth getting.
Cockfighter is a gem of a film you're probably never heard of.  It's one of best films of the 1970's features one of Warren Oates finest performances and has been rescued from near obscurity by Anchor Bay.  The film looks very good on DVD and comes with several worthwhile extras.
Rent it, Buy it and tell your friends to get a copy of a great film they probably haven't heard a thing about.  This isn't for everyone and the subject matter is disturbing, but those who enjoyUnique quirky independent films need to have this one.

1370790,4,B00004Y6BF,"Directed by Monte Hellman (the man behind the ultra-laid-back super-naturalistic ""Two Lane Blacktop"" starring James Taylor and Dennis Wilson) and fantastically photographed by the great Nestor Almendros, ""Cockfighter"" is one of those 'cult' films where, as Danny De Vito puts it in that mediocre attempt at satire ""Get Shorty,"": the visual fabric is consistently maintained while the metaphor plays on different levels! Just check out the brutal slow-motion footage of the cockfight in the hotel-room and tell me it's not one of the most artistic sequences in all of cinema! For someone to try to do that in a film like this is very touching, indeed! Just think: would anyone ever think of a film about cockfighting, something they might show at a drive-in for a week or two in some hick-town somewhere, as having great potential for artistic expression? Not Sylvester Stallone! But people like Hellman do, and did! And I have a hunch that if Hellman directed a film about arm-wrestling or rock-climbing in the '70s it would've been just as good!",998784000,8,1046,5.017241379310345
1370791,5,B00004Y6BF,"Hypnotically splendid, offbeat and violent drama stars the incomparable Warren Oates. Oates is nearly mute for almost the entire film after he gets  a little too big for his britches. His thoughts(as narration) guide us  through the story. Harry Dean Stanton is here also and is perfect. Another  notch in the belt of cult director Monte Hellman(Two-Lane Blacktop/ The  Shooting/ Ride in The Whirlwind/ China 9, Liberty 37). This is a truly  unique film that is sadly almost forgotten. Thank goodness for dvd in the  capacity that it can allow a great director like Hellman to find deserved  appreciation among a new group of fans.

1370879,4,B00004Y6BF,"Produced by maverick filmmaker Roger Corman, ""Cockfighter"" is about fighting roosters as much as it is about a man obsessed with cockfighting. You may think this must be one of the most unmarketable films of all time, and you are right. It was a commercial flop then (even under the changed title ""Born to Kill""). But, with Warren Oates's strong performance, ""Cockfighter"" still holds its own today.

Based on a Charles Willeford novel of the same title, Monte Hellman's ""Cockfighter"" follows the life of Frank Mansfield (terrific Warren Oates), determined to win the ""Cockfighter of the Year"" medal. He has even vowed not to utter a word until he gets what he wants, travelling around from town to town.

Monte Hellman spends a lot of time showing the relationships between Frank and people around him, especially Frank's fianc&eacute;e Mary Elizabeth (Patricia Pearcy), who is tired of waiting. Troy Donahue plays Frank's brother Randall. Millie Perkins (""The Diary of Anne Frank"") plays Randall's wife Frances. The supporting players include Laurie Bird, Richard B. Shull, Harry Dean Stanton and Steve Railsback.

The film's quiet riverside scene with Frank and Mary Elizabeth makes a contrast with the actual fight scenes, some of which are pretty graphic, but they are essential part of the story, especially the final fight at the tournament to which Mary Elizabeth is invited. The film is photographed by N&eacute;stor Almendros (who later wins Oscar for ""Daye of Heaven"") and is co-edited by Lewis Teague (who went on to direct such films as ""Alligator"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"").

This is the cult director Monte Hellman's second credited work as director in the 1970s, following ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" (called by some ""existentialist road movie""), with which ""Cockfighter"" shares some of its stars and themes. Back then they made films like that, low-budget films that are raw and flawed, but stay with you after watching them.",1364083200,2,1937,5.13968253968254

1370910,4,B00004Y6BF,"W. C. Fields had a notorious and well-documented loathing of children and small animals.  There's nothing innately evil about children and small animals, but they tend to be small and cute and have been known to steal an audience's attention and sympathy without breaking much of a sweat.  Roosters tend to be small, if not terribly cute.  They're capable of diverting an audience's attention, though.  Would Fields have envied COCKFIGHTER'S Warren Oates?  After all, Oates not only gets to (really) kick a feathered, five-pound scene-stealer, but also, in a continuous, uncut shot, gets to stretch its neck out and chop its head off.

 Animals WERE harmed during the making of COCKFIGHTER and anyone who might find graphic scenes of violence upsetting or repulsive are strongly urged to let this one pass by.  Built on a small ($400,000) budget and shot on a tight, four-week schedule by Monte Hellman for producer Roger Corman (Hellman, on the commentary track, claims this is one of only two movies Corman never made a profit on) COCKFIGHTER is a quickie/cheapie that cuts deep against the grain by exploring more than exploiting.  Shot in Georgia and wisely going for a run-down, lived-in, authentic look, COCKFIGHTER introduces us to Frank Mansfield (Warren Oates) at what seems a typical point in his life.  He's making an outrageous bet with Jack Burke (Harry Dean Stanton) and we're soon to see minus truck, trailer, and live-in girlfriend.  Flashbacks teach us that it's not the first time he's made a wager he can't afford and won't back down from.  One of those ill-timed bets inspired a mocking `Look where your big mouth got you!' And so Frank takes a vow of silence, a self-imposed penance that speaks volumes of Frank's stubborn sense of honor.

 The vow is maintained throughout the movie, save for the intermittent voice-over narration. It's a vow Frank will keep until he's able to redeem himself to himself.  Of course, redemption comes in many guises.  For Frank, it may be finding the right bird - a white rooster named White Lightning, for instance - and riding him to the Championship, or it might be establishing a solid relationship with the woman he loves, Dody White Burke (Laurie Bird.)  The emotional meat of this one is carried in the scenes between Oates and Bird, a relationship that probably should have been fleshed out some.  If there's a flaw in this movie it's that it doesn't allow us into the triumphs and setbacks on the road to the Championship, and, it doesn't spend enough time with Dody and Frank.  Still, the movie spends a lot of time in the ring, and the down-home earthiness filmed in a quasi-documentary style delivers a powerful punch.  On the c-track Hellman says they considered using an amateur cast.  There are an awful lot of barking amateurs populating the screen, but Oates, the last American actor for all seasons, fits smoothly into this environment.  Some movie stars we admire because they do things that we wish we could do.  Oates is that rarer, much rarer, bird who we relate to because they're us.  That he delivers a powerful performance without uttering a word is little short of astounding.

 Master cinematographer Nstor Almendros captures perfectly the furtive beauty of cockfighting.  Oates is perfect.  Stanton, Bird, and the rest of the cast acquit themselves with honor.  Hellman gives the subject a down-home feeling that fits well.  The story may be a little undercooked and the Laurie Bird character underdeveloped, but this is certainly better than the typical drive-in, exploitation fare Corman was specializing in at the time.  A very good film and worth a view.",1127692800,11,3642,4.940789473684211
1370911,4,B00004Y6BF,"Warren Oates plays Frank Mansfield in 1974's ""Cockfighter.""  Although outlawed in most states, cockfighting was legal in Georgia, and Oates portrays a top trainer.  However, Mansfield is also a deeply flawed man whose success leads him to recklessness.  On the night before a major fight, he impetuously enters a cockfight that ends badly.  At that moment, he takes a vow of silence, which he will not break until he can regain his position in the sport.  Throughout most of the movie, therefore, Oates is mute, with his thoughts serving as narration.

Warren Oates is truly great in this role.  His weathered face and ability to portray unsympathetic characters in a likeable manner bring great authority to this film.  Although perhaps best known for his appearances in Peckinpah films (The Wild Bunch, Ride the High Country), he also did extraordinary work in a number of lesser known 1970's films: Two-Lane Blacktop, Badlands, Rancho Deluxe.  He's not as well known as his peers Pacino or DeNiro, but his fans would argue that he's every bit as talented - count me as one of his devotees.

Director Monte Hellman was a collaborator with legendary producer Roger Corman, and he's simply one of the most underappreciated filmmakers of the 1970s.  He specialized in spare, low-key character studies, such as ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" (1971).  This film is so vibrant because of his talent for using naturalistic settings and minimalist direction.  His style is perfectly suited to this script, which was adapted by Charles Willeford from his novel of the same name.  The book is out-of-print, but Willeford is a marvelous writer of noir and gritty fiction, such as ""The Burnt Orange Heresy.""

Despite being a solid character study, the film is probably of limited appeal.  For the most part, the sport of cockfighting (if you consider it a sport) serves only as the background, and the characters drive the film.  However, the sport is presented in an unflinching manner.  The bloody and violent aspects of cockfighting are not glossed over in any way.  Thus, this film is definitely not for people who are squeamish or extremely passionate about humane treatment of animals.  In ways, though, the film is reminiscent of Peckinpah, who made violent deaths in ""The Wild Bunch"" seem almost operatic in their grandeur.  Watching the cockfights depicted here is almost sickening, but Hellman manages to capture their bizarre magnificence as well.  If you can set aside your distaste for the topic matter, then you will be treated to some great acting and directing and a truly unique cinematic experience.

DVD extras: For a DVD release of a fairly obscure 1970s film, this package is pretty terrific.  Monte Hellman provides an interesting commentary that really could serve as a primer for 1970s indie film.  A documentary about the work and life of Warren Oates is also included.",1124496000,9,2873,5.036016949152542
