1397682,5,B000056KE2,"This was my first ever video experience of Sam Kinison way back in 1987. Four friends and I were marking off the days looking forward to it's original airing on HBO.
  We were not disappointed, nor was I disappointed upon just receiving a copy of the video today.
  This was early in his popularity, just after ""Back To School"" and he is particularly raucous and loud in this video. He was still at his peak as a ""Wild Man"",
 still doing drugs (oh...THEY SEE THROUGH ME! OH! OH! OH!)and obviously pretty fresh from his breakup (I WAS MARRIED FOR 2 YEARS! HELL WOULD BE LIKE CLUB MED! OH! OH!)
  But there is utter brilliance behind the screaming. His treatment of religion is one(""Think Jesus is coming back?"" Jesus - ""Yeah I'm coming back. As soon as I CAN PLAY THE PIANO AGAIN I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!"").
  Another is his skit about sending food to the homeless in the African Sahara (""Stop sending these people food. Send them U-Hauls! Nah! Send me. Everybody on board! We'll make one trip. See this stuff! (he is scooping up imaginary SAND) ""Nothing grows in this S---! Nothing's gonna grow in this S---! Get your kids, get everyone aboard! I'll take you where the FOOD IS!!!! You live in a F------ Desert!"")
  This video could not possibly disappoint a Sam fan.",1076544000,12,1261,4.535398230088496
1397683,1,B000056KE2,"I bought this DVD and the ""Sam Kinison - Why Did We Laugh"" DVD and the ""Why"" DVD is much better (and cheaper).  It includes interviews from other actors/comedians and all the best footage from the ""Breaking Rules"" DVD.  Plus cuts out all the homophobe/AIDS material which crossed the line.  You only need the ""Why Did We Laugh"" DVD -- it's an excellent tribute and very funny.",1067558400,6,376,4.582089552238806
1397684,5,B000056KE2,"This is a MUST buy for all Sam Kinison fans. We miss you Sam, but thankfully your spirit will live on in the dvds provided for our entertainment. Every time I listen to Sam Kinison I can gurantee you I will be having respitory problems after the show is over, due to all the laughing you get out of this guy! This particular dvd is one of my favorites. So if you're a newbie to Sam's work or a fellow fan and you don't have this, BUY IT! IT'S 110% WORTH IT!GOD BLESS YOU SAM, WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU!",1039392000,15,501,4.02
1397685,5,B000056KE2,"Love him or hate him, Sam Kinison was a comic genius, and was extremley talented at what he did.  Sure, he might've offended many and raised some eyebrows, but that's what he wanted to accomplish.  Sam was one of a kind all right, and this DVD does him justice.
I have the tape, but I was glad that it came out on DVD.  First off, the picture looks really good.  It was a pretty old performance, too.  And there's some cool extras.  Like never before seen material, which is really hillarious.  This is a must-have if you love Kinison.
This is a great performance.  Through yelling and engergetic story-telling he talks about marriage, drugs, being arrested (thanks to his ex-wife), pleasing women (in a way I cannot describe on this site,) and much, much more.  He's always able to make me laugh, even if I feel guity afterwards.
Sam was a true genius.  It's too bad he's not around.  So many talented people have died to quick and left us all too soon.  Kinison was a one-of-a-kind, and no one will ever be able to duplicate him.  That IS a fact.
We miss you, Sam!  R.I.P.",1027814400,55,1074,4.413265306122449
1397686,5,B000056KE2,"The world was robbed of comedic genius when Sam Kinison was killed. Thank God for these current DVD releases that will preserve his memory and comedy forever. Sam may not have released many concerts or albums in his time, but the ones that are out there are unforgettable. Some of the subjects discussed in this show include (...) of the dead, Hell as Club Med, the real reason Jesus won't come back, and licking the alphabet on a woman. And that's the tame stuff. This is Sam at his prime, before he became the gigantic coke-fiend he was later known for (not that he wasn't funny THEN, too). Buy this DVD and learn why, even after he's been dead and rotting for years, people just can't shut up about him.",1004918400,8,706,4.438461538461539
1397687,5,B000056KE2,Kinison in top form.  DVD looks great with some bonus footage of a later show when he was obviously strung out on drugs big time.  Sad to see him like that.  The only thing that disappointed me was the fact this is written up on the back of the DVD as a 'Never before released concert' but is actually the same exact show as the HBO tape in the yellow cover that was released in the 80's.  A must have in the collection to show your friends who have never heard of Kinison.  R.I.P. Sammy!!,989625600,19,489,4.105263157894737
1397688,5,B000056KE2,"I remember the first time I saw Sam, it was during his HBO special the same special that this DVD is taken from.  I was at first shocked because of his straight ahead in your face relentless rambling.  But I never stopped laughing, I was rolling on the floor during the enitre show.  This is the first time I have seen that HBO show since it first aired back in the early 80's.  It is just as funny today as it was then.  The DVD has extra footage of a Las Vegas show Sam did several years later.  The later show was not as crisp as his HBO apperance, but classic Sam non the less.  He never really cared what other people or the establishment thought of him, he joked about everything nothing was off limits.  For this I commend him, he had a gift and he used it.  I was said when I heard of his death.  There has not been another Sam and there never will be. RIP Sam....
If you are a Sam Kinnison fan you need to get this DVD.  If you like in your face unbridled humor you have to get this DVD.",988070400,10,996,3.9797979797979797

1397709,5,B000056KE2,"Watching this routine is as a barrage of bullets. A non-stop barrage of impactful hilarity. An excursion into the mind, judgments, and insights of this comedic talent.

Comedy as practiced by Kinison was an expression without reservation of his thoughts on religion / ministry, marriage--everything--sacred and profane.

If you are a weak person and are offended by language and depictions of the human condition--watch videos of bunnies hopping on fields of clover--and pretend that you haven't similarly ruminated about the topics in this stand-up routine.

Comedic genius is when a person can articulate and distill the actions of the human condition in such a manner to make one think--the cringe comes from within us--a feebleness brought on by our circumstances.

Sam Kinison was a pentecostal minister as late as 1975 manifestly known for lambasting the base condition of the human experience. Ostensibly, he saw and experienced corruption in this vocation and could not handle the vulgarity of the profession and decided it wasn't for him. He alludes to the dichotomy by vocal vexations--his brand of critical examination in this routine.

1397710,5,B000056KE2,"Wanted to get a DVD version as my VHS recorded from HBO over 20 years ago is barely watchable. It comes with some bonus footage at the end of other shows Sam did when he was at his peak of partying, painful to watch the bonus footage.",1376956800,,234,4.0
1397711,4,B000056KE2,"What can I say -- it's Sam Kinison.  Yes he was a potty mouth.  Yes, he screamed a lot.  But that was the charm that was Sam Kinison.  He's still funny after all these years and his death was a loss to the comedy world.",1371340800,,219,3.8

1397713,5,B000056KE2,Sam Kinison was a comedic powerhouse. This HBO special shows him in top form. Sam was unique and can't be compared to any other comedian. I do agree with some of the other reviews- the extras on this DVD show him on the downward slide- a real shame. I have watched this DVD over and over again- the material is still sharp- cutting edge and honest. If foul language bothers you- don't watch this DVD. The language is an integral part of the show and just adds more color and texture to his performance. His biblical humor is second to none. His relationship humor is from his own personal experiences and is undeniably right on. This is a must have DVD. Enjoy!,1341360000,,660,4.418032786885246
1397714,3,B000056KE2,"SAM KINISON: BREAKING THE RULES openswith an intro from Sam's mom; there's also a 1975 film clip of the former Pentecostal preacher in full swing.

His XXX rated stand-up routine begins with a reference to Iran-Contra. The subjects Sam covers include adultery and revenge, also truth vs. lies. During some positively blasphemous Jesus jokes, Kinison displays his former Evangelical style. After a segue to ""Pat Robertson for President,"" Sam closes this section with the resurrected Jesus trying to explain to an accusing wife why he was gone all weekend.

Next are mysogynistic jabs at ""heartbreakers"" and female weight gain after marriage. During his relationship advice for men, Sam pauses to introduce audience member Hugh Hefner. His raunchiest material (pleasing a woman orally) follows. After a warning that what came next was ""the bottom,"" Kinison launches into AIDS humor and some spirited gay bashing.

The set closes with Sam playing the piano and doing an original ""song."" He dashes off, exits the stage door, hops into a black Corvette with the license plate EXREV, and zooms away into the night.",1326931200,2,1108,5.17877094972067

1397716,5,B000056KE2,"IF you are a Sam Kinison fan, and you are sick and tired of political correctness, you will love him in this disc.  He rants and raves about everything including God, marriage, relationships, homosexuality, you name it!  His style was over-the-top, in-your-face, and most of all, totally uncensored!  IF you are a Sam Kinison fan you will definitely enjoy this stand-up routine.  If you are offended by things like profanity and insults and talk of sex and sexuality, you will NOT like this.  Sam did NOT care if he offended anyone and was not worried about how he worded things, which is what I enjoy the most about his act.  People who care what someone ELSE thinks of his act will definitely not enjoy this.  You have to be into raunchy comedy to fully appreciate this, and those of us who are familiar with Sam's style will be pleased with this recording.  (I know I was! I couldn't stop laughing!)",1293494400,,902,4.59375

1397719,4,B000056KE2,"A furious presence onstage, Sam Kinison screams, cusses viciously, and makes plenty of gestures involving the use of his microphone and groin.  The title of this former minister's performance, ""Breaking the Rules"", is quite appropriate.  Many will laugh hysterically at this show, most will find it entertaining, and (big surprise)  some will find it distasteful.  Kinison is full of passion and energy, but his delivery needs refinement.  The jokes are funny, but the pace of the show is too slow.  Kinison wastes too many words, delays the punchlines for too long, and chuckles too often at his own material.  The show never stalls to the point of becoming uninteresting, but a faster tempo would have made for a much better show.  I assert this fully aware of the fact that Kinison's claim to fame was his ability to lull the audience a bit and catch them off guard with his famous screams.  Usually four letter words, always perfectly timed, Kinison could holler up a storm to keep things shocking and hilarious.  It is very unfortunate that his life was cut short.  Breaking the Rules showcases a diamond in the rough that could have really shined one day.  Any fan of standup comedy that has never seen Sam Kinison should check this out.

It must be noted that this was filmed in 1987.  It sounds incredibly ignorant to consider AIDS a gay disease today.  But many of us were that ignorant in the 80s.  Still, he makes stronger statements concerning ""alternative lifestyles"" in the bonus material, which is sure to offend many people.  Perhaps all people, as the bonus clips are simply not funny to state it kindly. Also, the DVD includes a commentary track narrated by Sam's brother and sister-in-law.  They offer insights which may be of interest to hard-core Kinison fans that aren't put to sleep by their boring dialogue.",1187395200,,1831,4.832797427652733

1397721,2,B000056KE2,I saw him live in 1987 when he was hot and hoped this would be a great reminder of his hilarious sense of humor and delivery but it was far too short (only 45 minutes) and only had a couple of good routines.  My hopes were higher than what this delivered!  The bonus material was taken from Vegas when he was near the end and it really was not very funny.

Breaking the Rules was recorded back in 1987 (during the height of his career), Sam of course talked about Jesus (Jesus never had a wife, no wife let's you take off for three days, and you come back and say 'I was dead.'), being arrested (thanks to his ex-wife who put a loaded .38 in his luggage while he was stoned on his way to California), drugs (OH THEY SEE THROUGH ME, THEY SEE THROUGH ME), pleasing women (which I cannot describe on this site), and all that.

I was so happy to find nearly 20 years later my favorite site Amazon had the CD to buy.

1397728,4,B000056KE2,"No comedian ever made me laugh as much as Sam Kinison did the first time I saw him perform on a Rodney Dangerfield special. The infamous Ethiopian UHaul rant is probably the funniest bit I have ever seen.  His appearances on Rodney's other shows were generally pretty terrific as well as well as his turn in ""Back to School"".
He was so successful with Rodney's shows that that HBO gave him his own night, which is the main feature of this DVD.  It's classic Kinison and no topic is taboo.  It's pretty crass and if you are easily offended, it's not for you.  His highlights include a very funny rant about being dead (and I'll go no farther, but trust me, it's a blast).
The main program, which was filmed in 1987, runs about 50 minutes is fun.  However, also included are bonus clips of Sam doing standup what appears to be several years later (I couldn't find anything that stated the year it was done).  Here you can see what the life of excess drugs and booze had done to Sam.  He looks worn out, strung out and burned out.  He's not funny.  In fact, his rants are more filled with hate than humor, in particular one related to Jerry Lewis and his ""Kids"" with muscular dystrophy.  And there aren't a whole lot of laughs from the crowd.  It's a sad commentary on the man's life that I question why it was put on the disc.

I would recommend this CD for any long time fan or anyone interested in seeing a comic genius at the peak of his career. Sam was a one-of-a-kind comedian with delivery and timing perfected early on in his life when he was preaching for a living. The topics he covers in this performance include his relationships with women and marriage and scenarios of meetings with the devil and Jesus Christ. Very original and funny.,1477958400,,731,4.71875
