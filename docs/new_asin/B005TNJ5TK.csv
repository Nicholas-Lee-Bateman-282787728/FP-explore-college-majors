8486466,1,B005TNJ5TK,"Do not buy this dvd if you are interested in seeing a video of big sur. Nothing on this video says big sur...only an endless loop of Segalls  playing in some ocean waves somewhere.  This is a complete rip off of gigantic purportions . I've been to big sur many times and this ain't it. Plus this is a PAL dvd. I had to buy a multi region dvd player to even watch this junk! Don't be fooled like I was, keep your money and pass this one up.",1453593600,,439,3.9213483146067416
