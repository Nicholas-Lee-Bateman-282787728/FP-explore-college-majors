1279960,4,B00003CXLS,"A good rule of thumb is to not overthink a Godzilla (or Gojira) film. Save for the original 1954 version (which was meant to be dark), the standard Godzilla movie is pure popcorn and soda enjoyment. Godzilla 2000 is no exception to this rule. The big bad scaly one with the atomic breath is back, trouncing on Tokyo as usual while destroying whatever giant nemesis thinks it has what it takes to rule the world. I love the updated suit/CGI design of Godzilla. He looks fearsome, especially the sharp dorsal fins and the  face is a lot less kid-friendly as we'd seen in the Showa series films. Unlike some reviewers, the English dub is actually rather amusing, especially the lead baddie human Katagiri, who sounds like Toshiro Mifune channeling John Wayne. I even liked the hippie/stoner dude in the newsroom. Speaking of which, the human characters are fairly interesting and fun to watch. I'm kind of fan of smart-mouthed but sweet heroines, and the interplay between Yuki and Eo is comical at turns. Of course, the military is utterly useless against Godzilla but bless them, they keep trying. Their newfangled missiles were supposed to go through Godzilla ""like crap through a goose"". Then there's Orga, a pretty good enemy of the big lizard who gives as good as it gets. This is a fun movie for all fans.",1508889600,2,1309,4.741228070175438
1280029,5,B00003CXLS,"I'm a Godzilla fan. I have been for years. So, it was good to see this one become available on DVD. The DVD itself is good quality - good video and mostly good audio (a bit soft in places, but clear enough). For the true Godzilla fan, this movie is a big shift for Toho from the rather silly ""Godzilla versus...."" stuff they had been putting out for years. While it is not up to the standards of the original 1954 Gojira (or even the 1956 Godzilla), it is still good entertainment for the Godzilla fan in the house.",1508889600,,515,4.212121212121212

1280108,3,B00003CXLS,"Director Takao Okawara's ""Godzilla 2000"" is Toho Studios' second reboot of the Godzilla franchise, with this film again serving as a direct sequel to the original 1954 ""Gojira."" The story focuses on the conflict between the independent Godzilla Prediction Network and the government-backed Crisis Control Intelligence, who find a UFO on the sea floor. A Japanese scientist with the GPN, Yuji Shinoda, discovers Godzilla's regenerative powers. The UFO attempts to steal these powers and then reforms the giant alien Millennian, who mutates into Orga due to Godzilla's DNA. Godzilla battles and vanquishes Orga. The scientists then muse on how Godzilla's destructive power represents the destructive capabilities of humanity.
Like the preceding films of the Heisei period (19841995), ""Godzilla 2000"" attempts to tell a more serious story than those found in the later Shwa period (19541975) films, returning to the morality of the original film. This film, the first in the Millennium period (19992004), also follows TriStar Pictures' ""Godzilla"" film from 1998, starring Matthew Broderick. ""Godzilla 2000"" helps Toho to counter a film that critics and fans of the series did not like while simultaneously breathing new life into the franchise. Also, the sequence of the UFO flying over the city closely resembles the sequence in ""Independence Day,"" produced by Roland Emmerich, who also produced TriStar's ""Godzilla."" Unlike previous ""Godzilla"" films that used practical effects, models, and puppetry, ""Godzilla 2000"" features a great deal of CGI, primarily in composite shots. The effects are a little dated by modern standards, but were used sparingly and will elicit a certain nostalgia from those who miss filmmakers using CGI to enhance, rather than replace, practical effects.
The biggest drawback to this film is the English dubbing, which ruins the atmosphere at points. TriStar, in charge of the American release, hired Asian-American voice actors to avoid an overly Midwestern sounding dub and, though Toho signed off on the dubbing, I would have preferred the option to watch the film in Japanese with English subtitles. It's hard to imagine a Japanese newspaper editor yelling out ""Great Caesar's Ghost!"" like Perry White from Superman. Despite this, the film is a fun watch and a good addition to the ""Godzilla"" franchise.",1503100800,2,2333,5.429752066115703

1280111,4,B00003CXLS,"A bit of an anticlimactic ending, I personally wanted to see Orga evolve even further and give Godzilla a run for his money, but overall I enjoyed the movie, and I have to say, Godzilla has never looked more menacing or powerful than this movie's version",1502236800,,254,4.543478260869565

These are enjoyable movies, not equivalent to that 1998 American expenditure kinda godzilla movie, but enjoyable just the same for those of us with a penchant for fire breathing monsters.

1280327,5,B00003CXLS,"BOTTOM LINE: Toho's third series 'revival' of their classic monster mash franchise. This one's a fun adventure that's not too taxing on your brain. Godzilla's fresh look is different yet familiar, and his opponent this time is all-new instead of just another Showa series retread. The CGI isn't very good but it's serviceable. GODZILLA 2000 sports a great dubbing job contracted by Sony, rather than the usual tired Hong Kong voice crew that's done most of the G-films since the 1970's. The Blu-ray transfer is solid but not perfect. Still, fans should be happy. This entry is a good start to get the younger generation into the wild world of Godzilla. Recommended. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Routine deep sea survey off the coast of Japan uncovers a mysterious object at the bottom of the ocean that turns out to be a UFO - crashed on Earth eons ago. Meanwhile, a widowed researcher & his young daughter have been working out a means of predicting Godzilla's return to Japan. He becomes involved with a headstrong reporter looking for a story, and lots of human dramatics pad the middle 1/3 of the film. But then it's monster time! When The Big Guy shows up and wades into Tokyo Bay the UFO detects his arrival and attacks. The UFO, using genetic material sampled from Godzilla himself, creates an alien/Godzilla hybrid in order to more easily function in our atmosphere. Their goal? Use Godzilla's cells to adapt their own kind to our world, then kill the Big Guy; leaving Earth defenseless so they can take over! Think Godzilla's gonna take that challenge lying down? HA! In the end, the mutant alien monster, called Orga, and our atomic-fueled lizard hero turn downtown Tokyo into a sea of flames as they battle to the death.

THOUGHTS: This was my second opportunity to watch a Japanese Godzilla film in theaters (the first being GODZILLA 1985). It was grand fun. The audiences I was with were into it; everyone cheered, booed & applauded at the appropriate times. Great memories. Nothing really much new here in the way of story but the big draw to these films is never the story, it's watching gigantic monsters kicking the crap out of one another. Most noticeable to long term fans is the incorporation of CGI, although it's crude and mostly unconvincing. Still, it was nice to see Japan trying their hand at new technology, attempting to find ways to blend it with their beloved traditional man-in-suit & miniatures techniques. The results are a toss up, but overall the film is a heaping helping of old school comfort food fun. Godzilla's look is brave & bold yet still retains the classic silhouette and powers we've come to know & love. The new villain monster is a breath of fresh air instead of the zillionth rehash of Mothra or Ghidorah. Kudos to Toho for giving something else a shot at battling the G-Man.

THE BLU-RAY: A fairly solid transfer from Sony that does feature some crush (video noise), often inevitable when dialing up sharpness. Picture is otherwise decent. Sound is strong and the mix is level on both the original Japanese language version & the English language dub. Primary bonus feature is a full-length commentary track from the crew in charge of doing the adaption for Sony for the English language dub. It's a fun listen, with interesting stories about how these guys helped adapt the screenplay, the work they put into the sound design, music changes and the dubbing job itself. Other content is Japanese language-only Behind the Scenes material and a copy of the film's Japanese theatrical trailer.",1476835200,3,3551,4.827586206896552

Toho's response to the travesty ""-zilla"" that was released from Hollywood in '98, the Big G has shrugged off his kiddie cute moniker from an earlier age and once more doing what gigantic fire-breathing monsters do, neutralize cities, with extreme prejudice.
Forget all the ""Son of G"" and dancing G and I'm your friend! G nonsense, Big G is all out of bubble-gum.
This is why we love Big G.

1280577,4,B00003CXLS,"I saw this in the theater, which did much to erase the nasty taste of Tri Star's incredibly bad 1997 effort, and I was so glad of it. There is a bunch to like in 2000, a lot of things that gave it that classic Toho feel, though there is a strong vein of the ""kill Godzilla-study Godzilla"" plot element left over from the Heisei days. Here, it's not so intrusive because Miki Saegusa is no longer in the cast.
  The effects are as good as they needed to be, though Toho's people, at this point, had a way to go before they came anywhere near the skill set of ILM or the Weta Workshop. To be fair, I seriously doubt Toho gave the crew of 2000 anything approaching the budget enjoyed by ILM or Weta.
Orga was a bit of a stretch. Surely someone could have come up with a monster to remember, and he ain't it. He looks, to me, like a melted ape upholstered in Ace Frehley's boots.

1280688,4,B00003CXLS,"Once upon a time, Toho actually killed off the Big G to make way for a trio of Godzilla films to be made in America by TriStar.  Fortunately, 1998s Godzilla proved to be more than enough of this American kaiju nonsense, opening the door for Toho to bring the real Godzilla back well ahead of his 50th birthday in 2004.  Thus was born Godzilla 2000, the first film in the Godzilla Millennium series.  So, you basically have to forget everything that happened in the previous twenty-three Godzilla movies, apart from Gs appearance as a monster brought to life by tests of the atomic bomb.  Godzilla 2000 actually serves as a darn good comeback for the champ, who had never looked better than the mean, green, fighting machine he is in this film.  With redesigned scales and a more ferocious mouth, Godzilla actually looks like the monster hes supposed to be.  The special effects are good, too  featuring a nice blend of the crappy CGI and guy in a rubber suit shots that I frankly expect and want to see in a Godzilla film with a pretty impressive extended boss fight scene at the end.

Godzilla 2000s only real weakness is the story.  Were barely introduced to the main characters before Godzilla shows up and starts stomping his way toward energy sources, including a nuclear plant.  The writers apparently didn't want anything, including character development, getting in the way of their good, old-fashioned, Tokyo-stomping fun.  Snippets of backstory are added to a couple of characters but are never developed at all.  A larger problem is, of course, the English dubbing.  Tri-Star actually forked out a good deal of money to secure this films American theatrical release, shaving off about seven minutes of running time and adding far too many classic American expressions like Great Caesars Ghost and Bite me.  I swear they even have one Japanese guy inexplicably yell Gott in Himmel when he sees Godzilla.

Godzillas opponent begins life as a rock.  When a team of Japanese scientists try to recover a 600 million year old meteorite from the seafloor, the thing floats up on its own and soon takes off into the sky.  In reality, its a UFO that draws power from sunlight.  Godzilla isn't buying the whole rock routine, though, immediately attacking the thing.  After feeling each other out in that first round, both sides return to their respective corners, with the UFO hacking Japans computers and learning about Godzillas remarkable regenerative process while Godzilla bides his time waiting for the real confrontation.  Weak storyline and characterization aside, the penultimate rumble in central Tokyo really delivers  and thats what we care about the most, right?  I just don't consider Godzilla 2000 as forgettable as a lot of other fans seem to consider it.  This Godzilla looks great, and he isn't playing around, and thats why Im quite fond of this film.",1437955200,3,2871,4.898550724637682

1280693,1,B00003CXLS,"As Usual, Getting the UltraViolet Code to Work was a WAR.

This review is for the product I received from Amazon, which as part of the price, includes an UltraViolet download of the movie.  If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"".  There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery systems.

I entered my redemption code with UltraViolet and it was not accepted. I enter the same code with Flixter and I get a variety of error messages.  Finally, I did an online chat and the person helping me somehow put the movie in the system for me, the whole process was slow and very tedious. Yes, I had a ""good"" code.

I often purchase other movies that have a iTunes redemption code.  In 10 SECONDS, I can watch my movie on any iOS device with zero hassles.

Godzilla 2000 is a 5-star movie.  However, the decision of the studio to use UltraViolet massively detracts from the pleasure of this purchase.

1280891,5,B00003CXLS,"Just  finished watching ""Godzilla 2000"" released by Toho Studios.
""Godzilla 2000"" was made by Toho Studios as a rebuke of the 1998 American remake of Godzilla starring Matthew Brodrick - which was a box office bomb that had been produced by the makes of Independence Day.
Which is why I suspect that much of the action in ""Godzilla 2000"" focuses upon an alien spaceship that has parked itself high in the skies above Toyko.
Choas ensures as its soon revealed that the giant spaceship is actually a giant monster in disquise and Godzilla and it do battle.
Not to give away too many spoilers, but the giant spaceship doesn't survive its encounter with Godzilla.
Great Godzilla Fun!
Recommened!

It amused me at least, for I was working for that company at the time (although not their Japan branch).

I have not watched all of the U.S. version on the blu-ray, but from what I've seen it's on par with the quality of the original DVD release, which was very sharp picture quality. I did notice during the scene where Godzilla arrives at Tokyo Bay for the final confrontation, there are a few shots that are very dark, and aren't like that in the original DVD release.

1281139,5,B00003CXLS,"manage to get this movie a few days ago and just watched both versions,  i do not regret getting it at all. im really happy having it.

This movie was made in 1999, a year later as a respond against the American version of Godzilla that was done in 1998 by Roland Emmerich which was a total fiasco and considered possibly by many from fans of Godzilla or non alike as possible ""THE"" worst Godzilla movie ever made. Possibly on the same lines  like Son of Godzilla, Godzilla's revenge and Godzilla vs Megalon even though there bad movies there still consider it by many as classical for there times. the 1998 version was so bad that even Toho discarded the movie as not a Godzilla movie and the monster name was change from Godzilla to Zilla, this is pretty much Toho trying to save face because this was also there mistake for never checking the progress on the movie.

So to fix everything they made a year later in 1999 Godzilla Millennium or as its know in the US, Godzilla 2000. There has not been a Godzilla movie in theaters in the US since the Godzilla 1985 movie (also know as Godzilla Godzilla 1984 in japan)or if you still want we could say the Godzilla 1998 been the last one but Toho doesn't recognize that movie as Godzilla so give or take.

-Story-

Pretty much straight forward, you have 2 factions in the movie.

The first faction is to study Godzilla and warn everyone about its approach know as Godzilla Prediction Network (GPN for short which is a small group) which created by Shinoda ""a retire teacher and a ex CCI member"" with the help of his little daughter lo(not sure of the name) which she manage the finances and memberships of the organization and lastly the new member of the GPN name Yuki who she works for a local newspaper which she is trying to get great pictures of Godzilla but the problem that she has is that the radiation that Godzilla emits from his body it  damages the picture films.

Then there is the second faction which is the Crisis Control Intelligence agency (the CCI for short, led by Katagiri (rival of Shinoda which he use to work for the CCI). This agency is the counter to the GPN where as they want to study Godzilla, the CCI wants to destroy him since its there job to protect Japan from him. however, while the GPN is trying to save as many humans lives by warning of Godzilla's imminent approach, the CCI is willingly to have human casualty toa degree against the monster so they can destroy him (the Godzilla Defense Force in the 1990 heisei series was a much better than this one). Because of the actions that the CCI takes it cause Shinoda to leave the said agency and form the GPN instead to help everyone as much as he can as well to keep studying Godzilla.

During the course of the movie the CCI discover a meteorite in the depths of the ocean that was there for millions of years and they try to bring it up to the surface which they and suddenly the meteorite starts to moves on its own. Its later discover that its not a meteorite but an actual alien space ship that landed on earth millions of years ago and that the sun light awoke said spaceship. The spaceship takes off and goes to confront Godzilla which he scan him for a type of cell that his looking which Godzilla posses. this cell would be the focal point of the movie later, Shinoda discovers that it posses healing abilities which heals Godzilla from any wounds or illness which if studied properly it could actually be useful to mankind. They name this cell a Regeneration -G1 which is explain why Godzilla cannot be killed or why the Aliens are interested on him. So the problem that the humans have to face, do they killed Godzilla and face there end because of the alien, or let Godzilla fight the aliens.

- Review:-

The movie is pretty good, it has some great moments and not so much, but overall very enjoyable.

The Blu-ray version comes with 1 disc which brings you 2 versions of the movie in it, the Japanese and the English version which are separate options. The reason to this is because the Japanese version has scenes that the English version does not have which there suppose to be important to the movie. Because of this, the Japaneses version is 107 mins long in comparison to the English version been only 99 mins long ( thats 8 mins missing from the original which one of the scene was very important for the movie, never understood the cut they did for the English version).

specs of the movies if everyone wants to know:

- Quality: for both movies are at 1080p HD, however depending the version your watching the Japanse version is a 2.35:1 while the English version is at 2.40:1. both are wide-screen. have to say they look very clean compare to the old DVD that i bought years ago when it was release (except that it did not included the Japanse version to begin with so im happy the blu-ray has it).

- Audio: depending the version your watching is there respectively, the Japanese version is a Stereo DTS-HD MA while the English version is a 5.1 DTS-HD MA. Do note although the sounds are very clean but be prepare to hear loud explosions music and sound effects. lol

- Subtitles: both have the same subs which are English, English SDH and French. There is no Japanese subs for both versions if you are wondering.

- Duration: depending the version your watching, the Japaneses last 107 mins while the English version last 99 mins (due to the scenes that its missing from the original).

- Special features: this movie brings 3 special features, Filmmaker and Crew Commentary, Behind the Scenes and the Original Trailer.

-Conclusion-

Granted that the story and some elements of the movie have there certain flaws, its still has some great moments as well been a enjoyable one (far more enjoyable than the Godzilla 1998 by Roland Emmerich). Do i recommend it? sure, this is a great movie collection that anyone can enjoy and the best of all it brings the original Japanese version which is awesome as well some special features which is quite rare to see in a Godzilla movie for the west side of the world.",1411430400,2,6066,4.4913714804722975
1281140,4,B00003CXLS,"The Blu-ray release of Godzilla 2000, including both the American version and Japanese version on the same disc, is a decent release.  It retains the audio commentary from the DVD release of the American version, along with the short compilation of behind-the-scenes special effects footage, but it lacks the North American Theatrical Trailer found on the original DVD.  It does contain the Japanese Theatrical Trailer, which is nice, but I wish that both trailers had been included.  The Menus of the Blu-Ray are also, well...bland.  The Tristar DVD release had some very nice interactive menus with sound and footage of Godzilla, with menu-specific backgrounds for audio and special features.

For the Video and Audio themselves, I'll have to say that Godzilla 2000 (The American version) has never looked and/or sounded better.  For Godzilla 2000: Millennium (the Japanese version), the film does look good, and sound fantastic, but there's and odd darkness to it, along with a slight tint as well.  Now, the Japanese version of the film had the exact same problem on its original Japanese DVD release as well, so I'm guessing that Sony just didn't want to cause any problems by changing the brightness or color timing of the Japanese version when putting it on the disc.

To be honest, I prefer the American cut of the film, as it has far better pacing and sound effects than the Japanese version (and better dialogue) when the two cuts are compared.  The American version also has additional music composed by J. Peter Robinson (Highlander 3, Charmed), and some additional stock music by Akira Ifukube.  The end credits of the American version also begin with Ifukube's Rodan theme before weaving into his Godzilla March, before finally segueing into Takayuki Hattori's end credit music, and then ending with Godzilla roaring over the final few notes.

As it stands, this is the best that the American version of the film has ever looked or sounded, except for when it played in theaters, of course, and the Japanese version is finally available in North American for the first time.",1411171200,2,2088,5.005780346820809

The 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack is an improvement over the DVD's 5.1 track, but not by much.  You also get the original Japanese version of the movie, but honestly, it's not like this is Rashomon and needs to be watched in it's original format.  Plus, the 2.0 DTS-MA track for the Japanese version is weak.  It's amazing how much sound effects work was added to the American release and it's much better for it...listen to the commentary for more info. Extras suck (as before) but this time you get the original Japanese trailer and not the fun American release trailer.

1281204,4,B00003CXLS,"Godzilla 2000 isn't a great movie - I'm not too interested in either its human characters or Orga, Godzilla's opponent. But it does have arguably the best Blu-ray release of the new ""Toho Collection"" range, so it's worth picking up if you're a fan.

The Blu-ray comes with two versions of the film: the original Japanese cut, and a dubbed / recut version that was released in American theaters. I'm glad to have the choice between the two versions, because they're very different in some ways. The Japan film is slower, more serious and somber. The American version edits out about 10 minutes of material, so it's faster-paced and more fun; it also recuts some of the action and features extra music and louder sound effects. Probably, my ideal version of the film would combine the faster American pacing with the more serious Japanese dialogue; but until somebody assembles that ultimate cut, I'll have to settle with flipping between the two versions on this disc.

In terms of picture quality, it's interesting to note that the American cut has a much brighter and clearer print. By contrast, the Japanese version looks decidedly murky and not quite up to Blu-ray standards. It's surprising that the original Japanese film hasn't been as well-preserved as a recut exported version, but there you have it. In terms of sound quality, both versions seem fine to me; indeed, Godzilla's roars have never sounded so awesomely loud before.

Unlike most of the recent Godzilla Blu-rays, this one has some decent special features. There's a commentary track with a guy called Mike Schlesinger, who supervised the American recut of Godzilla 2000. He explains the reasoning behind his changes to the film, showing a lot of enthusiasm for both the original material and his own tinkering with it. While it would've been preferable to have at least one member of the original Japanese production team on the commentary (or at least in a making-of special), the commentary is fun as it is, and makes this feel like a proper Blu-ray release. Finally, there's a short but fun special feature with behind-the-scenes glimpses of filming Godzilla and the model effects.

Really, my only gripe with this Blu-ray release is that the Japanese version of the film has a somewhat mediocre print - which I understand might constitute a big problem for some buyers. But apart from that, this is a nice release with a decent offering of special features, and well worth the modest price tag.",1410652800,4,2468,4.911270983213429
1281205,4,B00003CXLS,"If you've bought most of the Godzilla blu-rays on the Toho Godzilla collection you've probably noticed that the English and Japanese ""versions"" are merely audio tracks, replacing all instances where Japanese is spoken with English being spoken. This time though, English and Japanese are different cuts of the movie that have to be selected from the menu instead of just audio tracks that can be easily switched between by pressing the audio button on your remote. The English version is basically the Japanese version with random bits of footage cut out to make the movie shorter, as well as many prominent script changes (such as when Io calls Yuki ""oba-san"" (aunt, also used to mean ""middle-aged woman"") to ""imbecile""). The English version footage looks noticeably better than the Japanese version, almost as if the English version was remastered and the Japanese version was simply tacked on as an afterthought. This is different from the other Godzilla Blu-rays where Japanese was always the default language option. The lack of an uncut English dub really hurts.",1410480000,2,1068,5.14367816091954

But that's not all.

I'll go wayyyy out on a limb here and say the real charm of Godzilla 2000 is in watching for the references to other films the writers seem to have weaved into the film. There's the lighthouse scene from The Beast From 20000 Fathoms, the cold-blooded general from Dr. Strangelove (""I'm not saying we won't get our hair mussed!"") who spits out lines such as ""These missiles will go through Godzilla like cr-p through a goose' (George C. Scott as ""Patton"".) and the crusty, but thoroughly unlovable big city newspaper editor bossing around the ace reporter/photographer straight out of Superman, and finally homage is paid to The Day the Earth Stood Still by this film when the Japanese military tries to lash the all-powerful alien machine to the ground with ""unbreakable"" cables (similar to the tactic used on GORT by the US Army, with the same effectiveness.)
But topping all of that is the obvious character of Katagiri, Godzilla's arch human antagonist obsessed with killing Godzilla. To accomplish that end Katagiri is perfectly willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone, and to destroy civilization in the process. And he's managed to convince his followers to take part in his obsession to kill Big. G. Does that remind you of anyone from literature and film....say....Captain Ahab from Moby Dick???

This is mere speculation on my part. For all I know the makers of Godzilla 2000 never meant to pay tribute to those past films. But I can't help but wonder. Intentional. or even real or not, such serendipity makes Godzilla 2000 much more interesting and fun to watch especially for film buffs, but also because the parts fit into the film so well.

Aside from these positive features of the film this is a pretty standard, unsurprising dish of Big G stew. In a nut-shell (SPOILER ALERT!) a big threat/villain arrives on Earth in the form of a giant chrome flying electric razor with taking over on his/her/its mind. Big G takes exception to giant chrome razors trying to take over his home, so he fights back. The chrome razor produces a giant something-or-another monster thingy which tries to eat Big G. Needless to say by the time Big G gets through with the chrome razor it's only good for making razor blades, and all that's left of the giant something-or-another is a pair of smoldering socks. Oh, and Captain Ahab gets his comeuppance.

All in all Godzilla 2000 is a very good Godzilla movie. Nothing more, and nothing less. I give it 4 stars, knocking one star off because the writers didn't include a reference to the film ""Bambi"" in it.",1401667200,,2734,4.796178343949045
1281271,5,B00003CXLS,"This has always been my favorite Godzilla movie. Godzilla looks really awesome and scary in this movie. The story is really great. The special effects in this movie are a lot better than in the Showa and Heisei series. This is the best movie in the Millennium series. The fight scenes were really cool. And again, Godzilla just looks awesome and very intimidating. Its very well made. I recommend buying this movie. Its a must-have",1401667200,,431,4.76

When he gets ready to use the nuke breath you will be like awwww yeah!! They just did everything right in this one. The dialogue is hilarious, lots of classic quotes. In my opinion this is the coolest looking Godzilla of them all. Any fan of these movies will love this one. Godzilla shows up to the final showdown with his classic theme song playing and you know that someone is going to get hurt.

This movie has nearly wall to wall Godzilla smashing, although I was a tad disappointed with the foe...  A spaceship that came from a rock at the bottom of the ocean and later turned in to a monster.  Kind of lame.

1281390,5,B00003CXLS,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie last night for what must be my umpteenth time over the years now. I was actually one of the few who went to go see this when it was initially released in the theaters here in the States. Back then the movie crowd loved it, as did I, and there was even some cheering and clapping when Godzilla finally defeated the evil monster Orga.

Watching it again all these years later and the movie just gets better and better with each view. The Godzilla suit is very detailed, menacing, articulate, and pretty amazing. The sets, miniatures, and special effects in this one are very, very good to great. Incredible even in some scenes. The CGI effects aren't too shabby either for the most part, but the practical effects are simply stunning and realistic. Toho studios really went all-out when they ressurrected Godzilla for the new millenium and it definitely shows.

This movie is the perfect choice for a mindless, fun, late night monster mash bash. And with the upcoming release of the new American made Godzilla movie this year, I can only hope that Toho studios decides to throw their hat in the ring once again and bring us an all-new Godzilla feature, since it has been a decade now since we have seen them make a Godzilla feature.

I had read somewhere that this was Toho's answer to Tristars 1998 movie which wasn't so welcomed by fans featuring an alternate take on the Kaiju mythos. This is the Godzilla we all know & love.

1281528,2,B00003CXLS,"When I was a kid I was a huge fan of Godzilla movies. I have very fond memories of making my parents take me to Blockbuster and picking out one of his many films on VHS. I saw just about all of them that were out at the time, from my favorites Godzilla VS King Ghidora and Godzilla VS Gigan to the not so great Godzilla VS The Sea Monster and Godzilla VS Mecha Godzilla. I think, up to Godzilla 2000, there were only one or two of his films that I hadn't seen. Needless to say the big G man holds a special place in my heart and he always will. I actually got to see Godzilla 2000 in the theaters way back in the day and my little brain could hardly handle the level of awesome I thought I was seeing. So how does this nostalgic classic I first saw when I was 11 live up now that I'm 24?

Not well, as a matter of fact. I mean yes, I get it, this is a Godzilla movie, I didn't pop this in expecting Shakespeare or even Pacific Rim. All I really wanted was to see the hero of my childhood beat up on giant rubber monsters and destroy Tokyo for the fiftieth time. As cheesy and insane as these movies are the Godzilla fights were, for the most part, at least entertaining. It must take a lot of stamina to wear that big rubber suit effectively and actually make some cool fight scenes, but whoever is wearing it in this film didn't seem to have any. Godzilla just sort of waddles around like a toddler occasionally flailing his arms around and opening his mouth a little bit. He has no movement, no energy, nothing to make him exciting. My wife said it best when she said the monster battles reminded her of two old people awkwardly trying to fight one another and just falling over themselves in the process. Yeah, that's kind of what this movie is like. A giant old person waddling around for an entire movie until a second old person waddles in and awkwardly fights the first old person. Weird, never thought I'd describe a Godzilla movie like that, but there it is. At least the G man looks cool and his fire breath is pretty neat, otherwise the fights were be the biggest bore fests I've ever seen.

I'm not even going to judge the plot and characters all that much. I mean, let's be real. The story is ridiculous, the acting is atrocious, the writing had me busting out laughing at many points at how bad it was, but we expect that from this kind of movie. I mean, they didn't help, but there comes a time where even with that excuse it's just way too silly to ignore. Like the end of the film when the main characters are explaining that Godzilla keeps protecting them because there's a little piece of him inside everyone while he's simultaneously destroying everything in sight right before their eyes. Protecting? He's freaking setting Tokyo on fire! On what planet is that considered protection?

In the movies defense at the time this was far and away the best of all the G films in terms of special effects. Take that with a grain of salt, mind you, as none of the G movies had anything special in terms of effects, but this one did look pretty decent. Though that may sound like backhanded praise, it's really not meant to be. The cities look great, the battles semi epic, and Godzilla is pretty damn cool. That Godzilla costume warrants the extra star all in itself. He looks great.

Well so much for that diversion into the films of my childhood. Though it did put a giant grin on my face to hear the Godzilla theme music as he smashes through Tokyo adult me just couldn't get into the spirit of things like eleven year old me could. Let's hope the Godzilla: King of the Monsters holds up better. Until then, cheers.",1374192000,6,3630,4.302631578947368

1281530,2,B00003CXLS,"I will try to break this up as a criticism of the dvd and the movie.

The movie is basically a ID4 wanna be with Godzilla thrown in. The suite looks great. Godzilla looks predatory and lizardlike. Yet, he comes across as stiff in movements. There is poor CGI to animate the alien ship that looks like a gigantic flying nose.
Orga, the adversary of the film, is so badly animated, you would think you were watching a Power Rangers movie.
The design of Orga is cool. But its execution is terrible. Many of the matte shots are terrible.
Many of the scenes where Godzilla is rampaging look unfinished.
The story revolves around a scientist and a man determined to bring the big G down.
Godzilla's radioactive breath looks great. This time it is an orange glow.
This film feels rushed. Well actually it was. Fans not happy with the 98 debacle wanted a better Godzilla.
This was rushed to placate them. Hence why I was baffled with the ID$ rip off scenes since it was made by the two morons who ruined Godzilla and forced this movie to be made in the first place.

Now the dvd.
I can tolerate the Japanese version, BUT, this is the AWFUL dubbed version.
Where the writers decided to put their own dialogue into it.
For example, a scene where the woman goes ""Bite me."" She never said that.
They totally make the daughter a demanding brat when in the Japanese version, the daughter and father are like Batman and Robin, a perfect duo.
She is mature and intelligent for her age, but in the movie, she is portrayed as an annoying brat.
It ruins it because in the Japanese version, there is a touching scene where she thinks her father is dead and doe what a young daughter would do when faced with such a fear, she runs him and embraces him crying.
The dialogue in the American version is insulting, campy and dumb. Like the ""crap though a goose comment.""
Memo to stupid Hollywood, he is not a joke anymore, its not the 70's anymore.
Kindly translate future movies and not make up your own scripts please!!!",1373155200,2,1997,4.453551912568306

That is precisely not the case here.  This disc has an English track and a French track.  That's it.  So if you want to see the movie only in the french and goofy half-assed english VAs, then by all means get this disc.

For the rest of you out there, beware, the specs for the disc above are false.

It is surprising. There had to have been effort involved in not including the native language track in the movie.  Why would you release a japanese movie in french and english and not bother to keep the japanese?

1281608,5,B00003CXLS,"After Tristar's 1998 US Godzilla film being panned by critics and fans, Toho decided to bring back The King of The Monsters eariler than expected. What we got was a fun filled and action packed monster movie that brings Godzilla back full force. This to me is what the american version should have been(although I enjoyed that movie for what it was). This was the very first and only Godzilla film I ever saw in theaters, thankfully because it was the first Godzilla movie to come to US theaters since ""Godzilla 1985"". Man was this movie an experience to see, because I am a huge Godzilla fan!

The plot isn't really spiecal, but it's fun to follow anyways. It's about a small team known as GPN (Godzilla Prevention Network) who tracks down the Monster king for studies, while the military are trying to destroy him (as usual). Meanwhile a reseach team discovers a huge unnatural mass of rock which turns out to be a crashed alien ship. The ship ""wakes up"" and begins searching for a subject to clone themselves with. It turns out Godzilla has a certain useful gene known as Regenerator G1 which can rapidly heal Godzilla when injured. From there we get a big fight between Godzilla and the UFO in downtown Tokyo with the UFO creating a new monster named Orga to combat Godzilla.

This was a fun movie that never gets boring. Godzilla looked better than ever with strong update. Godzilla is officaly green for the first time ever! Whereas the previous G films have Godzilla in a darkish grayish color, yet many people say he's green. Now it's offical. The new monster Orga is also a great looking monster. It's face may have been inspired by the american Godzilla, because they look similar. The fight between the two is epic and fun with both monsters beating the crap out of each other. Orga even attempts to eat Godzilla which is a sight to see. But also the scenes with Godzilla against the army are fun as well. The human characters are also good. It's not Citizen Kane acting, but it's like action film acting which works. I loved the human villain, Mitsuo Katagiri who is just a complete a-hole to Godzilla and to the lead characters. The models used in the movie look really well done, back to basics with old school Toho style. I was also surpised to hear Akira Ifukube's Godzilla theme return! It was a nice treat to hear it and it fits the movie well. Even hearing Rodan' theme was nice too.

Although, there are some dumb bits in this film. Some parts come off as being very rushed, mostly the spiceal effects. Some parts have Godzilla photo shopped in real backgrounds which looks weird and out of place. It even has a phony CG scene of Godzilla swimming which really looks like it belongs in the PS2 Godzilla games. Of course this film did come out in 1999 in Japan, a year after the american film. So it's expected.

Regardless, this is a fun Godzilla worth a watch! It was just really great to finally see Godzilla in the theaters again and to quickly fix the misconceptions the 1998 american film gave audiences in the US. I personally enjoyed this movie and it's silly bits. That's what Godzilla is all about, silly fun!

Godzilla looks meaner and cooler than ever!
What I like about this movie was:
1. Godzilla was returned to his true roots!
2. The Japanese actor were good!
3. Orga was an awesome looking monster!
4. Shiro Sano was a very powerful Japanese actor and was a great edition too
the Godzilla universe!
5. The plot was good!
6. The Japanese are getting better with their effects with each movie!
7. The special features on the DVD were good (Audio Commentary, theatrical trailers,
behind the scenes, etc.)

What I didn't like was:
1. The movie should have focused on Godzilla more than
the U.F.O.!
2. The battle between Godzilla and Orga could have been
a little more impressive!
3. Some of the phrases used by the actors were
insulting each other!
4. I didn't like the fact that this was a reboot for
Godzilla, I would have real like to have know what the
new Godzilla would do after 'Godzilla vs. Destroyah'!

Bottom line: This may not be the best Godzilla movie made, but fans should enjoy it,
for the most part!

Too bad that they won't make a Godzilla 2000 vs Zilla movie. Anyway's the Story is very Good. It's About A Godzilla against a Giant alien called Orga. Who want's to destroy earth while the one Japanese man want's to Kill Godzilla while the others are trying to save Godzilla from being Killed and is studying him. and it's very Exciting and thrilling.
The monsters look very  scary and very Realistic that my father think's they did like destroying there on homes to make a Godzilla movie...
Godzilla's fire color is different. It's color is Orange with a little bit of Yellow. and has Purple spines.
it's pretty short. only 99 minutes long, this may be boring for Adult's but for kid's it's fun with 2 giant monsters fighting. Godzilla final wars is the last of the Godzilla Movies. But not anymore...

1281699,4,B00003CXLS,"Godzilla 2000 is a great return for the King of the monsters. Yes, at first glance it's sloppy and the kind of film you would watch to laugh if you weren't in the mood for one of the 70s series.  The CG effects are poor, the dialog is frequently terrible and the bad dubbing doesn't help matters, but in every other regard, this movie is a great installment in the Godzilla saga.

Fans of the Japanese Monster King who disliked or outright hated the Roland Emmerich movie will easily point out references and comparisons to the 1998 creature.  Godzilla 2000 is full of jibes at the beast known as GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), and the enemy monster, named Orga, seems to be a ""GINO-formation"" of Gamera, another monster that has competed with Godzilla, and metaphorically speaking, has tried to replace him as King of the Monsters during Godzilla's previous five-year absence.  Who can deny that Orga is a severe deformation of Gamera, with the same oily-gray skin as GINO and a mistreated ""special weapon"" (a plasma burst from the shoulder similar, though not identical, to the fireballs of the Gamera 90s trilogy, the same way GINO's flammable breath was a rehashing of Godzilla's heat ray).  As Orga steps out from behind the flames in one clip, his strikingly turtle-like features are even more obvious.

The movie, however, is not all camp and jibes.  A sense of wonder and curiosity permeates much of late second act of the film, as scientists discover a truly marvelous ability in Godzilla's cellular structure, and comment that he could be full of such mysteries.  This is factor that establishes how little we really know about Godzilla, and stands as a metaphor for how little we really know about our entire world and nature at large.

Likewise, there is a sense of mystery surrounding the UFO which eventually births Orga.  The human characters are at a loss to explain the creature's motivations and what it wants with Godzilla until the final act of the movie, and the UFO is afforded a great sense of menace, presenting more than just a physical threat as it drains the city of all it's data and nearly cripples all of what we call civilization in the process.

There are themes in the movie such as the exploitation of science for all the wrong reasons, the lack of ethical conduct and accountability in the face of what we don't understand and are afraid of.  These themes, while firmly stated, sadly feel under-explored.

What truly makes this movie great, however, is the opening and final acts of the film.  From the opening credits to the end of Godzilla's first rampage, the theme that Godzilla is a territorial and unforgiving force of nature is clearly established.  This theme from the very beginning is as prominent as it was during the Heisei series (80s-90s), even the movie from 1984.  Some of this feeling, unfortunately, is lost as soon as the human characters take up the spotlight, which wouldn't have been as bad if the dialog and dubbing were handled better.

The final act of the film, Godzilla's big fight with the new monster Orga, is a brilliant road to this films true climax.  The choreography is incredible, Orga has more than a few surprises up his sleeve, though the final moments of the fight are somewhat ambiguous and require a bit of thought to determine what actually happened between the two monsters that caused each one to act so strangely.  The natural solution, which I shall not spoil here, takes only a moment to reach once you sit back and reflect on it.

SPOILER WARNING - Next Paragraph

The true climax of the film, however, is perhaps the most intelligent act Godzilla has ever preformed, taking place immediately after the coup de grace: a judgment.  He singles out his human aggressor among a group of people and kills only this man before turning away.  This scene alone makes the movie worth full price.",1272412800,,3868,4.740298507462686
1281740,3,B00003CXLS,"This is not your common Godzilla movie. For one the suit is design in not a good way. The neck is too fat, and the fins are too long. In this film Godzilla fights a monster called Orga. Orga only appear in the end of the film. But the film does move along pretty well for the most part. Better then GMK, but not better then Final Wars which is the far best Godzilla movie.",1272153600,,372,3.973333333333333
1281741,4,B00003CXLS,"After the universally panned Tristar Godzilla (1998), Toho decided to correct some of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's mistakes. They only partially succeeded. Godzilla 2000 returns Godzilla to his rightful place as a rampaging, powerful, radiation-scarred daikaiju, rather than an oversized, cowardly iguana, but--unfortunately--it also features long stretches of uninspired people scenes and a monstrous opponent that fails to impress.

Originally, Sony proclaimed that the 50-year anniversary release of Godzilla 2000 would feature the film's original Japanese version. However, the 2004 DVD contains only the American release produced by Mike Schlesinger (the same as the original 2001 Sony DVD release). To some, the U.S. version is actually an improvement, since it trims the original running time by 12 minutes, only a fraction of which includes monster scenes. However, the English dialogue comes off as distinctly more tongue-in-cheek than the original Japanese, mostly to the film's detriment.

Regardless, Godzilla 2000 is an entertaining film that stands head and shoulders above the 1998 Tristar farce. Toho presents a fearsome Godzilla, much more in keeping with his traditional, malevolent image. The plot, slow as it is, offers an interesting look at Godzilla's regenerative powers, and the special effects are often exceptional. However, Godzilla's opponent, Orga, is much more interesting in concept than execution, and the long stretches of movie that prompt one to ask ""where's the monster?"" weaken what might otherwise be a Toho classic.",1265500800,2,1559,5.7155172413793105
1281742,1,B00003CXLS,"After Japanese audiences flocked to theaters to see Godzilla die in the excellent 1995 film Godzilla vs. Destroyer, he was not supposed to surface again until 2004, for his 50th Anniversary.  Unfortunately Hollywood made their disastrous 1998 turd which left a bad taste in fans' mouths, so Toho went and made their own Godzilla movie in 1999 which, unfortunately, turned out just as bad as Emmerich's film.  Thus, Godzilla 2000 flopped in both Japan and the US, starting a bad trend for the mostly terrible Millennium series of films, none of which managed to ignite the box office the way the Heisei films did.

Yes, Godzilla is impervious to conventional weapons again.  Yes, he has his atomic breath back.  Yes, he's massive and imposing again.  But the movie still sucks.  For one, the new Godzilla suit is the worst since 1968's Son of Godzilla.  The suit, which is stiff and rubbery, looks ridiculous from a dead-on perspective (or any perspective).  Toho should have rehired Koichi Kawakita, who created routinely fantastic suits for the Heisei series, all of which were incredibly detailed and visually impressive, particularly Biollante, Spacegodzilla, MechaKing Ghidorah, and Destroyah.  The lack of an animatronic Godzilla head, which was a staple of the Heisei films, is also absent, which means Godzilla barely does any emoting.

Worse yet, Godzilla literally disappears from the entire middle section!  The movie devotes far too much time to the human characters, none of which are remotely interesting or likable, and the ridiculous UFO that's disguised as a giant rock (a giant rock that can fly).  Orga, the monster that Godzilla battles towards the end, is easily one of the most forgettable kaiju in the series.  The movie is overlong and tedious, with some effects that look as if they were out of one of the 60s films.  In fact, Godzilla 2000 probably has some of the worst matte shots in the series, along with one of the worst musical scores.  Overall, this film is a bore, with only some decent cinematography and hilarious dubbing to recommend it.",1262044800,7,2073,5.0
1281743,3,B00003CXLS,"I'm not sure if anyone can capture the magic of Toho's 1960's/1970's Godzilla films again. The combination of odd visuals, coupled with unique dialogue, jarring editing and dubbing, and of course the amazing ""special effects"" all blended together to create a magic for fans of giant monster movies that has never been duplicated.

Well ""Godzilla 2000"" comes closest to capturing that Toho feel than anything else has in quite a few years. Godzilla looks really impressive here, smashing Tokyo as only he can. One of the things I like best about ""Godzilla 2000"" is that while he does his best to fight off the bad buy...Godzilla isn't a ""good guy"". Basically he's shown as an animal protecting his turf.

But for me a Godzilla film is only as good as Godzilla's adversary. If you have a lame villain, then the film will fail. Godzilla's nemesis in this flick is named ""Orga"". Orga is pretty impressive, but he takes quite a long while to show up on screen. For most of the film we see the villains represented by a giant silver spaceship....that basically flies around and lands on a building or two...and that's about it. Once Orga breaks onto the scene it's a fun ride, but it's a bit of a wait getting to that final showdown.

Still, if you are going to watch a late 90's ""Godzilla"" movie....this is the one to go with.",1261958400,,1321,4.6127659574468085

1281749,4,B00003CXLS,"Let me start off by saying that I have seen, as of writing this, I have rather recently seen fourteen Godzilla titles. I've seen some good ones and some bad ones (Space Godzilla anyone?) And then I saw this.

Let's start with the bad. The CG puts film-making back quite a few years. The space-ship reminded me of a badly-rendered ship from ""Flight of the Navigator."" The millennium Godzilla-suit is a little jarring at first. Why isn't his beam blue? Some of the compositing was both daring, bold, and badly-done. The DVD is dubbed. If you read the one-star reviews, this seems to have been a problem for some.

Now for the good: Good story, great pacing, formidable acting. The miniatures they used for this movie were really spectacular. Lots of great effects shots. After Orga gets out of his CG-stage, he's a pleasure to look at. The movie's got a great feel to it. The ending is simply magnificent. The overall movie has a new and unique feel to it-- rather like Godzilla vs. Megaguirus, which was by the same director-- and it's always good to see something new come from something old. Also of note, while this is a dubbed version, there are a few comical lines. It's rather refreshing to see that, and I know there are those out there who don't agree.

For those Godzilla fans who can't stand a little humor, if you look back at Mothra vs. Godzilla in the 60s, there were a few memorable somewhat-comical moments in that, too (involving a minor character's obsession with eggs, if I recall correctly).

You might have noticed that this isn't a five-star review. This was Toho's answer to the unfortunate American Tristar ""Godzilla"". I believe some of the over-use of computer-generated imagery might have been a result of this. I would have loved to give it five-stars, but some of the CG scenes involving Orga were just too ambitious and it detracted from an otherwise-great movie.

This is a must-see, especially since it's the first in the millennium series. If you like the Godzilla films, this is one that's great to own. Otherwise, it's definitely worth renting.",1215129600,,2076,4.723756906077348

Why do they keep shooting at him when he is impervious to pain? I thought the Japanese were smart? In this movie two characters, father and daughter, seem to like Godzilla who destroys a heck of a lot of the city and kills thousands of humans. Somehow or other we are supposed to identify with the ugly beast.

In this movie Godzilla fights a giant rock from outer space that turns into a spaceship then into a monster and then Godzilla...well I don't want to ruin the ending.

1281828,5,B00003CXLS,"Given I'm from the ""Raymond Burr"" generation of Godzilla Fans, I must say, this remake is a fire breathing blast!!!  My brother and I grew up on the old Godzilla films as boys. I was not that impressed with the one that starred Mathew Broderick, even though the effects were well done: I suppose my view is prejudiced by my love for the old Godzilla we all grew up on.  I love Mathew's work, for the most part, especially his appearance in the movie ""WarGames"", as well as his role in ""Inpector Gadget""; but lets face it, there is nothing that beats the old Godzilla formula I grew up with or the look of our dear old, handsome looking dragon.

As I think back to my own boyhood, my brother and I would often spend an afternoon building whole cities in our bedroom, using erector sets, lincoln logs, and other building type kits, while orchestrating our own play scripts and while having our stuffed animals destroy the make believe city we built in our bedroom.  Loads of fun and it kept us out of our parents hair. What inspired us; well, Godzilla, of course! (chuckling)

Watching this first, of the new millenium remakes, was a delight. All was very well done, for the most part, along the lines of the old Godzilla film formula. Some scenes are a little hokey, effects wise; but it still only adds to the charm of the filming.  I had hoped someday, someone would follow the old Godzilla formula, using today's special effects, and bring back our old handsome dragon to stomp all over the world again. I didn't know these films were available, until I saw them offered in the ""Preview"" section of the 2004 Astro Boy anime series.  Guess I'm a little behind trying to catch up on the International film making scene these days.  This film looks really great for the most part and is awesome in surround sound.

The script is nothing complex. Man has found a huge, underwater rock that floats to the surface, is really an alien ship in disguise and gives birth to a horrible looking alien creature, as big as Godzilla, that wants to take over the world.  Comes Godzilla to save the day and banish this evil creature, while wiping out part of Tokyo to do the job.  I have nothing against the Japanese people, but they sure do have a thing against their own city; wanting to wipe it out all the time with a fire breathing dragon like Godzilla. (chuckling) In the end, Godzilla makes it clear no one messes with him, not even the head administrative official, who launches his attacks to try and destroy Godzilla throughout the film. It's clear the message with these films is that Godzilla serves a purpose: To keep mankind from averting greater dangers the Universe might throw at him, by having a mighty advocate on his side.  Problem is, if you live in Tokyo, you better make sure your property insurance is paid up when this large lizard shows up!

Like the old Godzilla films, you really don't see anyone directly killed in this particular remake, except at the end; when the head official gets his by the ""don't mess with me"" lizard he tries to destroy throughout the film.  Death is always near misses in this film, so it should be great for kids to watch. It's scary, but fun.  This is a nice change from all the films that show so much of death's gore and horror only all to graphically these days.

The original Japanese comes with the audio, with English subtitles, which is great and the minuture work looks even better than the old movie series.  Very real looking for the most part, more crisp; but still lots of fun, as Godzilla fights to protect and beat up Tokoyo in one fire breathing breath.

There is a short behind the scenes feature added to the DVD.  It's not very long and frankly a disappointment.  Even though its in Japanese, I would have liked to have had the main people interviewed, with english translations, to hear more about why this remake was finally being pursued and why this particular script was written to start off the remake series of films; since  their inception starting the year 2000.  It would have also been helpful to give some folklore behind the whole Godzilla mythology in Japanese tradition for Americans to understand better.  I think the Japanese have an interesting civilization which embrace Western method and views these days, in mix with that of Chinese traditions. Such behind the scenes interviews would have been a chance for the film makers to better bridge the generation and civilization gap for young viewers eager to learn about their culture and way of thinking I should think.  The commentary section of the movie is very, very good I might add.  Do take time to play the movie with the commentary on. Allot of information is given.

Otherwise, the packaging is just fine. Delivery was fast! The product arrived ahead of time. No problems with the DVD disk. In short, no complaints.

1281832,4,B00003CXLS,"Let me just say this about Godzilla Movies in general: Forget about trying to understand the ""plot"", if there was one to start with, it gets lost in translation/dubbing to English and none of these Millenium Series movies makes any sense at all. They seem to be an odd mix of fantasy, sci-fi, horror and drama. You really need to take a leap of faith into the Godzilla Universe to sit through an entire movie, the dialog and themes are hard to take. I'd say it probably boils down to nothing more than a  difference between Japaneese and American story telling sensibilities.  After watching the whole thing, My son and I like to watch it again a time or two, but we jump right to the best Monster battle scenes - that's the beauty of the DVD format, you can go right to the good stuff and pass up all the weird parts in between.

 That said, the MS movies are absolutely awesome. Compared to the older ""guy-in-suit"" Godzilla Movies, the new ones (90's-2000's) are cutting edge. They have mind blowing special effects, huge sets of cities built with models, and they seem to have a creepy, chilling, & darker look to the night scenes. The ""behind the scenes"" part is neat, showing how they shoot the films - just as enjoyable as the movie.

  The UFO is mosty CGI animation and looks goofy flying around, but the combat scenes between the army, airforce, Godzilla, the model UFO, and the alien monster are outstanding. There's missiles & shells flying everywhere, just like it should be, all out warfare. I didn't get the other's reviewer's mention of male/female sugestion in the scene, they must have a dirty mind.",1149379200,3,1616,4.609756097560975
1281833,5,B00003CXLS,"First off, the briefly-used CGI in this movie, unlike 99.99999% of CGI, is actually tolerable. It still causes Godzilla  to look more like one of those 'Pokemon' creatures on the Nintendo 64's 'Pokemon Stadium' game, but its better than the CGI of almost every other movie that uses CGI, because the CGI in those movies looks like it was lifted from the original Playstation, or, occassionally, something even lower than that.

Another redeeming factor of the CGI is that, even though they used the crapness that is CGI, they didn't use it very often. This movie would have been crap is Godzilla was CGI for more than the 10-15 seconds the CGI Godzilla was shown.

The G-suit used in this timeline's movies has a neck that is as thick as G's torso. Essentially, it looks as if the shoulders are lower down.

This gets five stars because its the second Godzilla movie that I haven't disliked any part of. Normally, apart from Godzilla  movies that Rodan is already in, I would say it would be better if Rodan was in it, but actually Rodan being in this movie would be very random.

There is a scientific organisation that want to study Godzilla. Giving them competition is a more military-based organisation that wants to kill Godzilla. Finally, an alien ship appeared and ended up launching a giant monster known as Orga, which had mutated due to the stolen DNA of Godzilla.",1144368000,2,1374,4.704166666666667
1281834,5,B00003CXLS,"This was a nice return to ""classic Godzilla"" after the American version was made. The story is about aliens trying to take over the world and Godzilla is the only thing keeping them from world domination. Yeah, this idea has been used more than enough times in the Godzilla series, but it doesn't hurt this movie at all. In the movie, you never actually see the aliens but you do get to see the monster they unleash on Tokyo called Orga. It's a nasty looking lizard creature that is really cool. The special effects are beyond compare when it comes to Godzilla movies. A lot of computer special fx were used in this movie. The UFO and Orga for the most part was all computer generated. Godzilla wasn't because all the fans like it better that way. Godzilla went back to being a bad guy in this movie, which is the way it should be, Gamera can take care of being the good monster of Japan, let Godzilla be bad!

Orga is cool because he has many forms and many different types of attacks.  He really gives Godzilla a run for his money.  There final fight is truly spectacular with terrific special effects and a fantastic final deathblow that is one of the best (perhaps the best) in Godzilla history.

1281917,4,B00003CXLS,"I was a big Godzilla fan in the 80s, when the Monster Movie of the Week seemed to play every hour of every day of the week.  Although I can't precisely remember every monster and every battle, I fondly remember ""Godzy"" (as my mom would call him, both of my parents are sci-fi fans) beating the rubbery stuffing out of his opponents.  Sometimes he had allies (Rodan), sometimes he had recurring enemies (King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla) and sometimes he just blew stuff up a lot.

Appreciating a Godzilla movie requires the viewer to adjust his expectations.  Godzilla movies aren't about great acting, linear plots, or special effects.  The Japanese movie industry understands its audience--if you're going to buy into a gigantic atomic-breathing humanoid lizard, pretty much anything goes.  ""Anything"" includes robots, aliens, robots built by aliens, size-shifting robots (Jet Jaguar ROCKS!) and tiny singing faeries.  And don't forget the giant moth.

Trying to make the Godzillaverse make sense is a huge mistake, as evidenced by the failure of the American version of Godzilla in theaters.  There's nothing quite like creating a titanic lizard and then not giving him atomic breath because ""that just wouldn't make sense.""

Godzilla 2000 is the Toho studio's response to the American movie.  Which is to say it is both better and worse.

By the time we get to Godzilla 2000, the big lug has been around long enough to create two rival investigating forces.  On the good guy side we have the Godzilla Prediction Network (GPN) led by Shinoda (Takehiro Murata) and his daughter Io (Mayu Suzuki).  The GPN team (if you can call them that) is accompanied by Yuki (Naomi Nishida), who is trying to get a good picture of Godzilla for the local newspaper.  Ironically, nobody can get a good close-up of Godzilla because he emits enough radiation to ruin photography.  Which really does make one wonder...shouldn't just being in proximity to Godzilla fry every human being in a hundred mile radius?

The bad guys consist of the Crisis Control Intelligence (CCI) agency, led by Katagiri (Hiroshi Abe).  The two groups have a bit of history: Shinoda used to work for the CCI before he left due to their ""violent tendencies.""  Where GPN seeks to examine and understand Godzilla for the good of mankind, the CCI wants to blow him up into big, radioactive chunks.

If you haven't figured it out yet, much of the movie centers on this philosophical argument as to how to treat Godzilla.  It's pretty clear that Godzilla doesn't care either way, as he comes rampaging ashore in a quest to find Japan's power sources.  Why?  Because in a not very subtle way, Godzilla is a parallel for the dangers of atomic weapons.  At least he was, when Godzilla first graced the screen.  Godzilla is the result of our warmongering and he retaliates with a vengeance by attacking atomic plants.

The CCI takes the direct approach, accepting any human casualties that might be necessary to take Godzilla head on. Tanks, mines, armor-piercing missiles...none of it works, because Godzilla regenerates at incredibly high speed.  That little tidbit of information greatly interests the GPN, who names Godzilla's DNA (Regenerator-1) and seeks to use it to save humanity.  Well, maybe eventually.  In another movie.

The unearthing of a meteorite by the CCI eventually interrupts Godzilla's rampage.  Sure enough, the meterorite, which is millions of years old, awakens when touched by light.  And that meteor is in reality an alien spacecraft with DNA mimicking capabilities.  It immediately makes a beeline for Godzilla.

This alien being/ship is known as Orga, and it goes through several phases.  First it starts out as a particularly feminine looking saucer.  Then it transforms, for about thirty seconds, into a large jellyfish.  This scene is so short and irrelevant to the movie that it seems like something was cut.  Finally, Orga turns into a big guy in a rubber suit.  And then we're back to the Godzilla movies from the 80s, where guys in suits slap each other silly until one of them falls down.

Godzilla has been redesigned for this film to make him look more feral looking.  For the most part, it works.  His dorsal spikes are particularly vicious, his fangs jut out over his lips, and his eyes are perpetually fixed in a cruel glare.  Orga, on the other hand, looks ridiculous.  He's a big, floppy-fisted monster with barely enough motion to move his gigantic oversized claws.

I never appreciated the physical acting required for Godzilla.  When it's a rubber suit, the emotion that can be conveyed must be over-the-top pantomiming.  This actor doesn't have it.

Godzilla has arms.  Past Godzilla movies have made sure Godzilla ripped things apart with his claws, mauled his opponents, or twitched in agitation.  This version of Godzilla doesn't have much to do but sort of wave his arms around slightly.  It makes him look pretty foolish when he's trying to be scary or in pain or.

The other problem, and this is a big one, is how Godzilla uses his breath weapon.  In other Godzilla movies, he reared backwards and you got the sense that breathing atomic fire took a lot of effort.  When the flames blew out of his mouth, it seemed like a true exhalation of atomic destruction. In this movie, Godzilla looks vaguely constipated, waves his head about, and then the flames sort of fall out of his mouth.

Throughout the first half of the movie there is some amusing dialogue (or at least, amusing translations), some real moments of tension, and a lot of human stupidity. During the second half, the humans pretty much stand around and watch the city get blown up real good.

Of all the characters, Katagiri steals the show.  When staring down Godzilla eye-to-eye, Katagiri simply lights a cigarette and says ""I've never been this close to Godzilla before."" But as well all know, nobody stares Godzilla in the eye and walks away without glowing.

The movie spirals into bizarre territory at the end, with Orga trying to absorb Godzilla, who strangely complies (there's a whole Orga/female Godzilla/male thing going on too, ICK). Scientists spout about Regenerator-1 genes, military generals philosophize about aliens from outer space, and Shinoda tells his daughter in a voice over about how Godzilla keeps protecting humanity because there's a little bit of him in all of us...

Meanwhile, in the background, Godzilla sets the entire city ablaze with his radioactive breath.

This movie is more like two movies, bridging the original Godzilla film with the later Monsterama battles that Godzilla has become known for.  In fact, it's more a homage to all the Godzilla films that went before.  All in all, a worthy successor to the Godzilla series and certainly more respectful of its origins than the American version.",1115856000,44,6800,4.958443854995579

Godzilla battles a UFO that shots plant vines or something at him and at some point turns into an Alien.  But the battles are not that good and they take place about an hour into the movie.

  I have always enjoyed a good Godzilla film.  I used to watch some of them on KTLA channel 5 (Los Angeles Independent station) when I was a young boy.  I especially got a kick out of the son of Godzilla and the ring of bad breath.  The Godzilla roar is always fun to hear.
  In this film, Godzilla looks meaner, bigger, taller, sharper teeth and a big mouth like he has eaten too many cars.  Still the same English dubbing and I like that new modern film Japan is using.  The old films looked grainy.
  What stays the same is that Godzilla is still played by a man in a costume destroying a Tokyo.
  A man officially tracks down Godzilla.  he is part of the Godzilla Prediction Network Mobile Unit.  Godzilla, of course, resurfaces and destroys Tokyo trying to get to every energy source he can.  He still likes to break ships in half too.  The military has invented a new missile that could penetrate through any material. It will go through Godzilla like ""crap"".  There is also a flying giant slab of rock to deal with too.  It flies like a UFO that can actually knock Godzilla on his butt.  Many more surprises.

1281972,5,B00003CXLS,"VIDEO QUALITY:
The release presented the film in it's original 2.35:1, and featured anamorphic enhancement. Colours were consistently vivid, and the overall look of the film was much sharper and brighter than any other DVD release. The brightness appeared to have been boosted during the night scenes (in particular the final battle) which helped a lot - the original Japanese print was so dark you could barely make anything out. Sadly, these enhancements also bring about grain that covers every scene of the film, and on occasion some mild artifacting. Overall though, it looks much nicer than any other release of the film.
AUDIO QUALITY:
The disc features three dubbing tracks, English 2.0, English 5.1, and French 2.0. All the of the tracks sound great, and the English 5.1 is outstanding. Sadly, there is no trace of the original Japanese audio. The quality of what you do get is still great though.
EXTRA FEATURES:
First and foremost in my opinion is the audio commentary from writer/producer Mike Schlesinger, editor Michael Mahoney supervising sound editor Darren Paskal, who worked on this US version of the film. It's a great commentary, very fun to listen to, and very informative about the editing decisions that were made for the film's US release. You'll also find 2 minutes of special effects behind the scenes features. Other extras include talent files for director Takao Okawara and Godzilla himself, as well as theatrical trailers for ""Godzilla 2000"", ""Godzilla"" (1998) and ""Anaconda"". It may not be chocker blocked with features, but what's there is excellent.
OVERALL:
Virtually the best video quality you'll find for this film, and the 5.1 audio sounds lovely. It's a shame that the disc lacks the original Japanese cut with Japanese audio, as was promised, though that boils down to Sony, Toho and release schedules. Basically Toho took so long to get off their asses and release it on DVD in Japan (over a year since the film's initial release) that they were reluctant to give Sony the uncut version with Japanese audio in fear that many Japanese would buy the much cheaper American alternative, and at the same time Sony understandably didn't want to miss out on a Christmas release for their disc. In any case you can still enjoy the film for what it is, and packed with the guys audio commentary it's not a disc you want to be passing up any time soon.",1083456000,7,2382,4.898514851485149

1282060,4,B00003CXLS,"Sure, ""Godzilla"" (starring Broderick) was an average movie, but as a Godzila movie, it bombed.  For one thing, Godzilla wasn't in it.  Luckily, Toho released this follow-up flick and brought back their star to be in it - the star, of course, is Godzilla.
I have to say this movie does ALMOST everything right:
- you've got the outrageous dialogue (""Great Caesar's Ghost!!!"")
- good Godzilla scenes (even the scenes where the JSDF is getting trashed)
- monster-on-monster action (Godzilla vs. Orga)
- the scenes flow
- both the Human Scenes and the Monster Scenes are interesting
- and you have the hilarious finale at the end where the actors make their conclusions on Godzilla known to the audience
But as well as the movie gets most things done, there really should've been MORE monster action.  The film's huge flaw was that no monster action occurs between minute 37 and minute 69.  Because of that, I can't give this movie 5 stars.
There are three Monster Scenes in the movie:
1) Godzilla trashing random things at the beginning of the movie
2) Godzilla vs. the military (one of the best one's I've seen involving the military actually); later, the UFO comes in and trades shots with Godzilla
3) Godzilla vs. the UFO (which later transposes into Godzilla vs. Orga)
[note: there is only one monster-on-monster scene]
In any case, here are some hilarious situations from the movie:
SITUATION 1
When the scientific team discovers the meteor's amazing buoyancy, Miyasaka immediately speculates that the rock is probably a vessel from outer-space.  (ONLY a scientist in a ""Godzilla"" movie could've jumped straight to that conclusion!)
SITUATION 2
During the climactic fight between Godzilla and Orga, he (Orga) starts chewing Godzilla's body.  Shinoda says ""Look at that!  He's trying to become a Godzilla clone!""  Katagiri says nothing, but looks away with a hilarious ""WTF"" expression.
And here is some hilarious dialogue from the movie:
DIALOGUE 1
When the military are drawing up their strategy to defeat Godzilla, the general reveals his plan to lure the giant monster into the bay where many underwater mines will be waiting.  One officer asks the general what his backup plan is (in case the mines don't stop Godzilla).  The general explains that he has new Armor-Piercing missiles that will go through Godzilla like ""crap through a goose."" (LOL where do they come up with this stuff?)
DIALOGUE 2
After the initial battle between Godzilla and the UFO ends, Miyasaka speculate about the rock's origins again:
MAN 1 - ""...Therefore I'm convinced that this vessel came from another galaxy.""
MAN 2 - ""A visitor from outerspace?  My God, it's just too crazy to believe."" (I guessed these people hadn't seen any 'Godzilla' movies before)
DIALOGUE 3
Katagiri is about to detonate City Tower where the UFO is hacking into the city's computers.  Katagiri then learns that his old collegue, Shinoda, is still inside.  Katagiri decides to proceed with the detonation on schedule, then says:
""Looks like I'm gonna have to send more flowers."" (very cynical indeed!)
(when Shinoda survives, and sees Katagiri later, he announces to Katagiri: ""nice try ***hole"")
DIALOGUE 4
After Godzilla defeats Orga, Yuki points this out:
""Boy, that's ironic.  It woke up after 60 million years and then Godzilla destroyed it.""
Shinoda pauses for a second and replies ""Uh...yeah.""
DIALOGUE 5
Here are the hilarious conclusions that the human stars come to at the movie's finale:
MIYASAKA: ""We scientists produced this monster, Godzilla.  And ever since, we tried to destroy him. [Godzilla proceeds to trash the city]
YUKA: ""Then why?  Why does he keep protecting us?"" [Godzilla continues to demolish buildings]
SHINODA: ""Maybe because Godzilla is inside each one of us."" [Godzilla then sprays his atomic breath at every building he sees]
All in all, ""Godzilla 2000"" brings back the REAL Godzilla.  This movie is entertaining all-around.  Yet, it won't get 5 stars because of that huge gap in the middle of the movie where no monster action occurs.",1077408000,2,4025,5.027067669172932

Landing atop the tallest building in Tokyo, it begins absorbing all of the data from all computer systems. What does it want? It wants the secrets of Godzilla's regenerative abilities so it can assimilate them. Thankfully, Big G returns just in time to battle the invader. The rest is one of the best ""Godzilla vs. evil monster"" confrontations ever! I loved it! My 7yo son loved every minute and that's all that matters anyway...",1070064000,3,1219,4.75

The human drama is excellent! The monster battles are colorful and the special effects are a drastic improvement! The only thing that bothers me is that Orga's hands are so huge that they look immovable and fake. Oh well. That's really the only flaw that I will complain about.

1282169,5,B00003CXLS,"This is probably the most revealing of all the Godzilla movies and makes the most sense regarding his powers.  The utter destruction he can wreak on the alien with his tremendous fire breath and his regenerative abilities both are very consistent with the story behind Godzilla's abilities as a monster.
He is practically indestructable because of his amazing regenerative cells and his nearly-impenetrable shielding skin/armour.  Also, the power he can pack into his fire breath is what people have come to expect from a super being like Godzilla.
On the more humourous side, we also learn - once and for all - that you DON'T get Godzilla mad as does the alien after their first encounter.  Godzilla simply comes back, angrier, meaner and more cunning than ever; he can adapt and learn from his previous mistakes and fights and teaches this ""meteor thing"" or whatever it is, a damned lesson:  You can't just expect to have the power and spirit of Godzilla by taking some skin cells from him and taking his form.  Godzilla is bigger than the sum his parts BY FAR!
A great movie.  Toho is finally making Godzilla stories which live up to the reputation of the very monster they created - an indestructable (or nearly indestructable as Godzilla can be badly hurt as we have already seen) super monster, created by human monstrosity (i.e. nuclear radiation resulting from atomic testing), come back to destroy humanity and all sources of the pollution which caused Godzilla to come into existence in the first place; almost like a modern-day version of the Frankenstein monster, except that the creature created by Frankenstein was initially a humble, innocent, beautiful, child-like human being not meaning any harm.  Whereas Godzilla is destructive right from the start...

The DVD's image quality is really great.  Presented in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio that I so dearly love, the film looks beautiful with beautiful and bold colors and excellent detail levels.  The audio options are for a 5.1 surround or 2.0 English dubs only.  No original Japanese soundtrack w/ English subtitles, which is how I prefer to watch these flicks.
Also included is a commentary track by the producer/WRITER of the American version.  In in he reveals the differences between the two versions, including cutting 9 minutes of footage out of the US release.  I would have like to have seen the original film as its director intended, leaving me a bit cold overall.

Godzilla 2000 is like a breath of fresh spring air after viewing that travesty of an American version. Godzilla 2000 is everything that the American Godzilla wasn't. Godzilla 2000 brings back the things that made me a Godzilla fan in the first place, and he looks better than ever. The new design of Godzilla rocks, and the coolest part? The new way he spews out his orange-radioactive breath. It just looks fantastic.
Basically, Godzilla fights a huge alien that has been trapped in a meteorite for thousands of years. Naturally, some silly humans unearth the meteorite and set the alien-craft loose upon Tokyo. Who comes to save the day? Godzilla, of course.
The effects are decent by Toho standards, but a lot of them look downright silly. For me, this has become a part of the Godzilla appeal. I WANT to see a guy in a suit crushing and burning little models. Rock on, Godzilla 2000!
The DVD has commentary by the guys who put together the American version of the film. It's runs a little boring, in my opinion. There's also trailers for this film and the American Godzilla. Not enough extras to satiate my Godzilla appetite. Still, I enjoyed the heck out of the film itself.

I'm not certain whether or not the occasional bad process shot or matte frame was an intentional homage to earlier, somewhat cruder Godzilla films, but it took me back to earlier, innocent days of childhood spent watching guys in silly rubber outfits smashing toy cities.
What has got to be the most hamster-stranglingly funny moment of the entire movie for me was a scene in which the alien spaceship is advancing on the city, casting a sinister shadow over everything in its path.  Out comes a shopkeeper to close up and head for the shelters when he suddenly looks up and cries out, ""Gott in Himmel!""  I fell out of my chair at that - a Japanese movie, dubbed in English, and one of the actors blurts out something in German.  Comic genius!

It's the complete opposite in this movie). But then again, I usually fast-forward through these ""people"" parts when I watch it again. The new monster was ok, but it had a very strong resemblance to Biollante, another good Godzilla villian from the 80's. It was an ok movie, even for a Godzilla movie.

1282266,4,B00003CXLS,"Report from Godzilla Appreciation Network
Re:  Godzilla 2000 and actions of Godzilla Prediction Network
Message begins:
The Toho Co. Ltd logo is synonymous with Godzilla, so its appearance preceding the movie gives one reassurance that this is NOT, I repeat, NOT a pedestrian Hollywood attempt that ended up as a cross between Jurassic Park and Independence Day.
Characters:  Shinoda, the idealistic head of the a GPN branch, and his equally intelligent young daughter Io.  They are easily the most likeable characters in the movie, and despite Godzilla's destructive nature, sees the leviathan as something beneficial.  He says, ""Godzilla needs to be studied.  He's a gold mine of knowledge.  He must be contained but it's the worth the effort.""  The relationship between Shinoda and Io can be summarized in this dialogue exchange between Shinoda and Yuki, an initially aggravating reporter who makes a reluctant partner.
Yuki:  Aren't you worried about your daughter
Shinoda: No, she worries about me.
As there is no mention or appearance of Shinoda's wife, it is safe to assume that the closeness between Shinoda and Io proceeds from this absence.
Then there is Katagiri, the 32-year old head of the Crisis Control Intelligence Agency.  His motivations seem to be personal in nature, namely against Shinoda and Godzilla, and that makes him more evil.  His motto is a tried and true classic:  if we don't understand it, destroy it.  A rotten piece of sushi, this one.  Cut him open and you'll find a block of ice instead of a heart. His assistant Miyasaka, who was a former colleague of Shinoda, has a spine of jelly, which comes into play later in the movie.  Note--compare the following acronyms and go figure:  CCIA and CIA.
The subplot involving an alien spaceship whose intentions turn sinister result in one of the most exciting battle scenes, in which there is a subtle bashing of the 1998 movie.  It also yields a cringing dialogue when it appears in view.  ""Great Caesar's ghost!""  As a reporter says, ""It's like a scene from an old sci-fi movie.""  He got that right.
Some Godzilla movies added to an ongoing myth, of what we learned about Godzilla.  In G2K, we learn about his remarkable healing abilities in detail.  Now we know how he (or his ancestor) survived the likes of Gigan, King Ghidrah, Mechagodzilla, and Megalon, among others.
This movie was best seen on the big screen.  For once, the viewer gets a true perspective of the awesome size of Godzilla, whether he's within spitting distance or when his silhouette is looming over the reddish glare of the horizon in the early parts of the movie.  The moral of this story-let the Japanese do Godzilla.  They know best.  After all, there's a small part of Godzilla in everyone of them.

1282267,2,B00003CXLS,"This movie is somewhat a nostalgic trip. It looks like it was filmed for the same budget as the old Godzilla movies. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, the plot is barely there. But then the plot always was Godzilla gets up and tears up Japan. The problem is that this isn't the 50s, 60s, or 70s.

Hmmm, sounds like the factual account of what lay ahead following the aftermath of Pearl Harbor.  To continue, this unknown foreign intruder has plans to take over the Earth, well at least Japan, by ""swallowing"" all of Tokyo's computer data.  As one scientist concludes ""It could end our civilization as we know it.""
Surprisingly this foreign intruder has a more than curious interest in Godzilla.  The reason?  An unknown discovery until now, Godzilla's genetic structure allows it to regenerate itself at the drop of a hat.  No wonder the Japanese can never seem to be rid of him! And there's good reason not to be! ""Regenerator G-1"" as this gene is named is the source of this Foreigner's acquisition and eventual take-over attempt!  For once it gets it hands, paws, claws? on the secret of Godzilla this ""Independent"" believes it will have its ""Day!"" You must have figured out by now where I am going with this!  Yes, that's right Godzilla 2000 is a more than deserved slap at that Tri-star version starring Mathew Broderick that should have been called 'JurasSick Park goes to New York.'
Hasn't anyone who has seen ""G-2000"" noticed how that Foreign Intruder bears a striking resemblance to that overgrown American ...? Needless to say, I've already said too much.  ""G-2000"" certainly holds its own to that ... imitator.  The Godzilla costume is much more elaborate, with a more frightening toothy look and more Spikey Spine fins.  The special effects at Toho are getting better and better with better fire breath effects and Godzilla swimming underwater looked really nice!
In conclusion, despite that Foreigner's attempt at usurping the King of the Monsters throne they never really learned Godzilla's secret...  Yea, we know it's a guy in a costume, yea we know it's cheesy, but we don't care!  Once Godzilla's theme starts rolling, we know its time for him to rock!
Whether you believe Godzilla is a metaphor for what happens when Man tinkers with Science or a metaphor for the horrible devastation when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were laid to waste, Godzilla will always and forever belong to Japan and Toho.

1282269,5,B00003CXLS,"It is difficult to say just which Godzilla film is the ""best"", since the Japanese film industry keeps making them. However, ""Godzilla 2000"" is arguably the best effort released in the United States to date. Upon release it was the first to see a major theatrical release in America in about 15 years, and after seeing it again on DVD, it is clear that this is deservedly so. It may be considered a landmark ""G"" film, set in a ""more realistic Japan"", while avoiding some of the ""comic book"" like quality of it's predecessors.
I find it necessary to make some brief asides before going further:

1) ""Godzilla 2000"" did not recycle any effects/audio, including the monster's roar, from the 1998 U.S. picture. This is obvious from listening to the soundtrack, even more so from the director's commentary, which states the fact outright.
2) As a ""classic"" Godzilla fan, I prefer the Japanese version, but do not think the U.S. version entirely stunk... What would have been the point of an American version if they had simply copied the Japanese one? However, the U.S. version will NEVER replace the original
3) High-tech Special Effects alone do not make a movie, just ask the producers of ""2001, A Space Odyssey"". Many cite ""2001"" as a landmark film, fewer would be willing to sit through the entire ""masterpiece"".
 That said, I'd have to recommend this film to anyone who loves Godzilla and/or action/adventure/Sci-Fi.
-To those in the West who complain about the dubbing, no offense, but: get a life! :)
 No matter how much many of us hardcore film fans would prefer the original films with sub-tittles, the majority of film-goers (the ones who ""pay the bills"" as far as Hollywood is concerned) do not, and the industry knows this. And with the advent of DVD regional coding, even getting the genuine foreign version of a film DVD like this will apparently soon be a thing of the past, unless you want to own two or three different ""illegal"" DVD players. The dubbing really is not that bad in Godzilla 2000(perhaps the best yet), and as long as the dubbed versions continue to try and make a concerted effort, as was done like never before with Godzilla 2000, I think fans/filmgoers can live with it.

-The special effects in this film were great, not as ""perfect"" as pure CGI films, but also not as ""sterile"", and much more life-like in many ways.
 The Japanese have found a great niche in combining traditional miniature effects (the trademark of the Japanese ""Giant Monster"" genre) with CGI to polish up the overall look of the film.
 Many will complain that these films aren't ""realistic"" enough.
 I consider the source, the same American public that found ""Diehard"", ""Speed"", and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" to be ""realistic"" films.
 One reviewer put it best when they said Americans (/Western audiences in general) have lost the ability to ""suspend their disbelief"", and enjoy a great Sc-Fi/Fantasy Film without having to have tons of Hollywood slick, and ""Zillions"" of $ worth of CGI. (If you've never had the experience of sharing one of these movies with a kid, and watching their eyes light up as they discover a whole new world, like Disney meets the Marvel universe, you're missing something. Don't forget how to be a kid, no matter how old you get).
Anyone who rates a fantasy film by the same standards they would apply to a serious subject needs therapy, anyway, so lets move on.
 Big monsters, Big explosions, people running for their lives. The plot is more than enough for a Godzilla film, more appealing and easier to follow than past Godzilla flicks, and the whole experience is good clean fun. Well, off to watch ""Reptilian"", lots of folks have slammed this film, too, so it must be good.

 In a nutshell, this film has more of what's likeable about Godzilla films, and less of what isn't, than any of its predecessors.
 If you like Godzilla/Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Action-Adventure films, get it!!

1282344,5,B00003CXLS,"Kaiju fans rejoice, our prayers for a theatrically released Godzilla film (since 1985) have been answered...and how! Purists like myself who have always felt that the magic of Godzilla has always been found in the comic operatics of a guy in a big rubber suit running through model cities, and who were so offended at the very appearance of a CG Godzilla (I am of course referring to that stupid Hollywood Re-Make by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, who should have stopped at Stargate!) will find solace in this lovely piece of cinema.
Let me explain some things: I am a film major. As one, I have seen innumerable films from almost equally innumerable countries, and I have found the cinema of Japan to be the best of the best! Why? Well, for starters, they know how to use special effects. See, in America, when we want to make a movie, we immediately decide that computer animation is the only way to go on any and all shots (even though frankly, CGI really isn't all that impressive once you've seen at least a thousand different films that all seem to use the same program!) But, in Japan, (where animators were actually experimenting with computers as far back as the early 70s before Disney ever got the idea to make a movie that took place inside one) computers are seen as secondary to good old-fashioned production values. Yes, Godzilla is still a guy in a suit (except for a brief shot where he is seen swimming), but it is not as though we are seeing Fisher Price model trains pulled fishing wire as he runs into buildings made out of cardboard. The wonderful people at Toho took their time on this one, and managed to make something far more enjoyable than anything those hacks Emmerich and Devlin could have ripped off and made uniquely their own (Why didn't they just call it ""War of the Worlds"" instead of ""Independence Day"" when ""W.O.T.W."" carries so much more prestige?).
The story of the film centers around an aging researcher and his young daughter, both founders of a study group devoting themselves to detecting and observing Godzilla. At the same time, the corporation the researcher used to work for (which has devoted itself to destroying Godzilla) finds a U.F.O. Which actually becomes a rather obnoxious opponent for Godzilla.
It's a typcial Godzilla story, but that doesn't mean it's still not worth seeing. On the contrary, This is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen outside of the Anime and the Kurosawa Mythos.
Oh, and about that re-make, I should also like to add that it holds the distinct honor of being the first movie I have ever walked out of! ...",1008460800,,2599,4.6521739130434785
1282345,3,B00003CXLS,"I can't find my old review on this movie so I'm writing a quick new one.
As with the new cycle of Godzilla movies in 1984, all previous movies except for the original 1954 one are ignored.
It's great to see someone try to bring Godzilla movies back to the big screen in the US, but I wish they could just leave them as the director originally intended it. This movie was editted (or censored) for its American release. (Even the first Pokemon movie was censored for its release here.)
I don't care for the editting of some of the scenes in this movie. In many action scenes, the same angle is used for too long. Simple changing the view more often during a fighting or military scene would have helped the pacing of these moments. There are also too many wide shots of Godzilla. There should have been more close-ups. It felt like Toho had to repeatedly show off the full kaiju costume - rather than simply make it an element of the movie.
I hate to compare it to a movie not available in the US yet, but Gamera 3 was released 9 months before Godzilla 2000 in Japan. In G3, the scenes were editted as they should have been which kept the few action scenes moving along. This director directed Godzilla 2002 too (released in Japan on the day I'm writing this based on info in the trailer from the Japanese web site). The Godzilla movies should be improving their production values in future releases. I just wish TriStar wasn't handling the import process of these movies.
The dubbing here is better than TriStar's straight to video Godzilla movies.
I started listening to the commentary for this DVD. The commentary is actually by the guy responsible for the dubbing and censorship. I could not listen to more than a few minutes of this and proves that TriStar might not be the best studio for handling this. He actually says that Godzilla movies are for kids. (Watch an uncensored copy of Terror of Mechagodzilla where a character commits suicide and tell me if that's for kids.) No one importing a movie should be assuming what audience the movie is intended for. (Something like Pokemon could be an exception.) All of the newer Godzilla movies are more mature than the original set of movies. Godzilla 2000 is not a kids' movie in my opinion. This reminds me of most Americans' assumption that anything animated is for kids. (All of those parents taking their kids to see Princess Mononoke even though it was rated PG-13. I don't know if any parents have tried taking kids to see Vampire Hunter D which is rated R.) He also admits to changing the dialog. I'm one of those people who want to see a movie (any movie) in its original form and feel that any translation should be faithful to the original. I didn't want to know that new lines had replaced some of the original dialog simply to explain something not described in the original Japanese.
Overall, the movie is OK, but seems to move along too slow at points. Some lines are too cheesy, and there is no easy way to tell if those lines came from the original Japanese or not. (Anyone who assumes these movies always have this type of dialog - just look at the new Gamera movies - the first movie of the series is available in the US.) The commentary made things worse for me. True Godzilla fans should still enjoy this movie. For anyone watching the series for the first time, you might want to see the 1956 version first. (The 1954 version is not available in the US. You can only get the 1956 edition with Raymond Burr scenes added.)
As you have probably noticed, I don't like how Toho has handled exporting its movies to the US. You can find letterboxed and subtitled editions of old Gamera movies (not fansubs), but none of Godzilla.",1008374400,,3697,4.511177347242921
1282346,5,B00003CXLS,"Here is an addendum to my previous G2K review.
With G2K, Toho has taken a big step forward both in terms of spfx technology and in bringing Godzilla to stunning life. Answering the naysaying Gamera supporters, Toho includes a number of cgi effects, some of which are not entirely effective, a great number of low angle shots which increase the illusion of giant creatures come to life, and many scenes of the Big G interracting with the human characters. This is a big leap up from the Heisei series, which, despite some criticisms of late, was a well done and exciting series. The story also takes place in a more realistic Japan, greatly adding to its realism. Though humor is scattered throughout the movie, it is not overused (a common malady of current blockbusters). The new G design is great. The Big Guy looks meaner and, despite his decrease in size (down to 50m from the Heisei's 100m version) he looks very powerful. The cast is good, thankfully free of any of the bizzare or annoying characters which have become all too prevalent in today's sci-fi. All in all, a great G film and an entertaining sci-fi/fantasy adventure.
The changes that Tri-Star made to this film are mostly unforgivable. As was expected, they camped up the dialogue, muddled the script and really screwed up the dubbing. Reviewers jumped onto these elements of the film like gorillas attacking a banana. To them, I have this to say: If an American film was released in Italy, dubbed into Italian, had about 20% of the footage removed and some of the remainder rearranged, was peppered with jokes that only someone from Italy would understand, and had some of the soundtrack replaced with polka music, would it be fair to fault the film's creators for these shortcomings? Wouldn't it be the fault of the Italian distributor and not the American filmmakers and actors? So why is it then that the Japanese film industry constantly faces ridicule for the mistakes of the US distributor? Think about it.
See G2K, despite the idiotic changes Tri-Star made to the film. The real Big G deserves our support.. that way no one will ever be bothered by anymore silly pretenders to the throne!",1005609600,,2164,4.773333333333333

Goofy visuals and sound effects, outrageous dubbed dialogue and a rediculous storyline.  So why is Godzilla 2000 so deliciously different?  It's good!  The Japanese filmmakers have upped the ante on their homegrown lizard epics.  The ""BIG G"" is better than I've ever seen him.  There is excitement to spare!  Bright, eye-catching visuals and awesome sound effects and music.  Lots of suspenseful scenes.  In many ways G2000 is better than the Matthew Brodrick, American made Godzilla.  Cheaper effects mean more for less money.  It really shows on the screen!  The pyrotechnics are particularly good.  I loved it when the fire would ""collect"" around Godzilla's mouth before spewing forward.  Nicely done!  I'll admit I was a little disappointed that there wasn't the usual stuff to poke fun at in Godzilla 2000.  It was too good.

This Godzilla put Devlin's Notzilla to complete and utter shame. GODZILLA destroys the city, not some trigger-happy bonehead GIs missing a target 200 feet tall. The plot was good (although near the middle it got a LITTLE long) and the characters were fine (sketched well and staying in the background BEHIND Godzilla.) Godzilla and Oruga sort of looked like Godzilla '98s iguanasaurus, but they were intimidating and scary. The ending was hilarious, too. If you're not a Godzilla fan this is kind of a gamble, but if you're a Godzilla fan, this will entertain or at least amuse you, and it'll wash the taste of G98 from your mouth nicely.",998870400,2,757,4.6992481203007515

The army fights him, using bombers, tanks and helicopters, while scientists discover an ancient meteorite under the sea. But this meteorite is really an U.F.O. and soon flies towards Tokyo! Godzilla too arrives there and attacks the U.F.O. To fight Godzilla, it creates an alien lifeform, the giant space monster Orga. Now, let the battle start...!
After Mr. Emmerich's try in 1998, Toho Eiga Company brings back the real Godzilla to make us fans happy! It's wonderful to see a legendary monster back on the big screen, even if this new film has it's flaws: Takayuki Hattori's score is by far inferior to the fantastic music of Akira Ifukube, and they use already too much of CGI effects. The model tanks and battles BELONG to Japanese Godzilla films and are an important part of the charm that made this genre last for 47 years. Please stop to fill Godzilla movies with lots of boring CGI! So GODZILLA VS SUPER-MECHAGODZILLA (1993) and GODZILLA VS DESTOROYAH (1995) are better movies, but GODZILLA 2000 MILLENNIUM still ranks as one of the top Godzilla films. Godzilla's new design is a standout!!
5 stars for the movie, but not for TriStar's version of it: There's no Japanese language track, atrocious dubbing, an almost unbelievably bad DVD cover, a stupid tagline, and - worst of all - about 9 mins. of footage have been cut from the original version which runs about 107 mins. It's uncut on Japanese DVD, but without subtitles. Hong Kong DVD version is uncut too, has a surprisingly good quality and includes English subtitles.

Unfortunately, this DVD does not have the original Japanese dialogue, but the dubbing is well done.  The dubbing is certainly much better than the Godzilla movies of the 60's and 70's.  The special effects are the standout of the movie, especially when F-15 jets attack Godzilla with missiles.  This DVD also has a brief, but interesting behind-the-scenes video of the making of ""Godzilla 2000"".

If there was one thing that tempted my partner & me to rent this DVD, it was curiosity over how much Toho may have progressed in terms of special effects. This company, after all, is responsible for building and systematically destroying so many miniature replicas of Tokyo over the years. In ""Godzilla 2000"" the modelmaking is a little better, a little more effective. There's some clever camerawork and even a little CGI (although I would've thought the Japanese would be MUCH better at CGI than is evident here).

If you fondness in your heart for Japanese Rubber Monster Movies, I can say with conviction that you'll have a lot of fun with ""Godzilla 2000.""

The monster that Godzilla battles begins looking like a streamlined UFO, but it isn't til towards the end does the viewer sees what the monster really looks like and what its purpose on earth is.

The characters are ultra flat, the dialogue is retarded, and the special effects are embarrassing.
But that's really not the point, is it? So long as it's not taken seriously, the movie is really quite fun. The actors are a scream; simply saying ""I am scared"" or ""I am happy"" would be more subtle than their facial expressions. The preposterous dialogue is often rip-roaring. Many of the action scenes are strangely gripping, and it's almost sad seeing the weirdly cute Godzilla suit get smashed by missiles. (Oh, there's a hilarious line where the general says the army's new missile will go through Godzilla ""like crap through a goose."") There's problems though. The movie probably could have been a bit shorter. Intuitive editing could have removed several scenes which just seem to repeat themselves. The middle of the movie also puts little emphasis on Godzilla, concentrating more on the UFO brought up from the bottom of the ocean. Too bad, since Godzilla should be the star. Also, the final battle was a little too long.
The movie gets an extra star just for the ridiculous and dumb line at the end. ""Why does Godzilla protect us?"" ""Maybe there is a bit of Godzilla in each one of us."" Eww boy.

Sadly, Toho has moved away from using its stable of older kaiju characters (such as Angilas, Baragon, Manda, Gigan, Gorosaurus, Rodan, Ebirah, etc.), in favor of new and ever-more-implausible foes from outer space.  Recent films have offered such losers as ""Space Godzilla"" and ""Destoroyah,"" the latter being better represented by Legion in Gamera 2 (a competing line of kaiju films starring a giant flying turtle).
Godzilla 2000 is no different. The ""alien"" (called ""Orga,"" short for ""organization"") is not scary at all, in fact it is totally lame.
The movie is lame.  The typical Godzilla film goes as follows: A new monster appears, destroys Tokyo.  Godzilla appears, and battles the new monster. Godzilla loses.  New monster goes on rampage. Godzilla reappears (either alone or with allied monsters), and kicks the living crap out of the new monster. Roll credits. THAT is what we pay to see!
We do not pay for CGI effects.  We do not pay for lame scripts.
Godzilla 2000 fails because it is not confident enough in the original story device for all kaiju films.  Yes, it beats Sony's crappy ""Godzilla"" film (which was not about Godzilla at all).
If you like Godzilla, keep an eye out for Godzilla vs. Megaguirus, the NEXT Big-G film from Toho, where he battles an honest-to-goodness kaiju...the mutated insects from the cave in the original Rodan! They grow into a giant dragonfly.

1282568,4,B00003CXLS,"In an enormously entertaining new outing, Japan's famous not-so-jolly green giant returns in all his glory to once again trash (miniature) Tokyo.
Proving point positive that if you want the real deal, you have to go the source; in this case Toho Studios, the true guardian of the Godzilla legend. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's thunderously dull and dispiriting Americanized 1998 version (though technically impressive) only proves this point - Toho KNOWS Godzilla, and delivers in this new film all that makes Godzilla movies great. Though it certainly doesn't match the seamless digital effects work on the American version, this film revitalizes Japan's most deliriously entertaining export with true verve and infectuous fun. It's all here... horrendous dubbing (though on the DVD the option is thankfully offered to view the film in its original language, with subtitles - watch the dubbed version first, though - its hilarious), third-rate special effects, and a bizarre storyline in which nothing is off limits.
All of it is awesome, possessing a huge amount of everything the American version lacked - genuine charm. While the film does contain a few scenes by director Takao Okawara that clearly attempt to mimic (or maybe parody?) Emmerich and Devlin's ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"", these are ill-advised. ""Independence Day"" did not win an Oscar for Best Visual Effects for nothing, and their version of ""Godzilla"", however awful it may otherwise be, was visually and technically miles above this film. That being said however, it is impossible not to get into the spirit of fun this movie was clearly intended in.
Toho is now making use of digital effects, and some are unbelievably awful, but most work in the best B-movie way. Case in point, in one of those wonderfully trancendent moments in gloriously ""bad"" movies, is when Godzilla finally unviels his new, CGI-created ""radioactive breath"". The scene comes about a third of the way into the film as he faces off against a giant spaceship, the supposed occupants of which are attempting to steal the big guy's power of spontaneous regeneration. Up to this point, Godzilla has not unleased his most famous trait... and here finally does in a spectacularly staged scene that is utterly sublime.
This new ""rebirth"" of the legendary lizard is wonderfully perfect in all its B-level awfulness, and a welcome and totally fun return to monster movies still made ""the old fashioned way.""",979603200,,2452,5.163316582914573

1282572,2,B00003CXLS,"...against the dubbed Godzilla films.
With the advent of DVD technology as well as movie-goers who can read, I was hoping that Godzilla 2000 would be released in the form in which it was first released: that is, in Japanese. And with English subtitles. After securing a few ""G"" films in their original language I cannot watch dubbed and ""edited for Americans"" versions. I found the dubbed voices, even if they ""matched,"" to be so annoying, so insulting, so distracting... that the experience was painful.
Story-wise, it's OK, but lacks the surprising sophistication of G vs. Biolante (Japanese-language version/English subtitles). Suit-wise, I didn't like it, but since this is G-Jr. of G vs. Destroyah I understand. General-effects wise, the monster battles in this one are anemic. END",978998400,,786,5.196850393700787
1282573,4,B00003CXLS,"Godzilla lives! Of course. Some of you more enthusiastic fans might recall the Japanese hit ""Godzilla vs. Destroyah"" from 1995. In the final battle scene, Godzilla Jr. is basically killed by Destroyah, which enrages Godzilla, and futher fuses the nuclear meltdown. After Godzilla finishes Destroyah, he enters the meltdown stage. What most people do not notice is that Godzilla melts down over Godzilla Jr. releasing all the radiation, and ultimately reviving Godzilla Jr.
The Godzilla portrayed in Godzilla 2000, is in fact Godzilla Jr. in full form, twice as powerful as his father. Many critics say that Toho ""killed"" their Godzilla to make way for the American version of ""Godzilla"". Wrong.. the meltdown of Godzilla had nothing to do with the American version.
The most common question I am asked is ""What's up with Godzilla walking into the mouth of ""Orga"" at the end of Godzilla 2000?"" Well, if you recall from ""Godzilla 1985"", the scientists realize that Godzilla's brain is very bird-like. Orga learns of this while absorbing all the data from the Tokyo mainframe computers. As a last ditch effort, Orga lures Godzilla into it's mouth using the same bird-call that caused Godzilla to end up in a volcanic crater in 1985. The plan backfires, and Godzilla uses the atomic heatray, which leads to Orga's demise.
Overall, a great movie! Lots of action, and a nominal job at looping the voices! This movie is another must-have for any Godzilla fan, and will shine like a diamond on your DVD shelf with the rest of your Godzilla library!

1282574,4,B00003CXLS,"OK, let's get the nitty-gritty out of the way: while this is miles better than the ludicrous American ""Godzilla"", I'm not yet going to compare it point-for-point with either of the previous two Godzilla series, since this is only the first effort in a totally new direction for the G films.  Don't worry, we won't have long to wait for future comments, since the new sequel ""Godzilla X Megaguiras"" has been out in Japan for some time now and will doubtlessly make its way to the States sometime in the near future.  When that happens, the new series as a whole will be able to be put into a proper context.
That being said, there are many good things to be said about ""G. 2000"", not the least of which is the new Godzilla suit.  FINALLY, some of the menace of the original Godzilla has been resurrected, in no small part due to the extra-big mouth and sharp teeth that Toho has endowed upon the newest Big G.  The blending of suitmation and computer FX is at times positively wonderful--there's quite simply nothing like an actual actor smashing the real (albeit miniature) buildings, which  a computer cannot replace.  The battles between Godzilla and the alien creature Orga aren't quite on the grand scale of previous films like ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"" (1964), but are still miles above most of the pitiful CGI-happy action films that Hollywood has been all to happy to release nowadays.  So the dubbing is less than stellar...did you really expect it to be otherwise?

1282636,4,B00003CXLS,"Well I'm mighty happy to have Godzilla 2000 on DVD but there had been news that this would include the Japanese audio track and reintroduce the 8 minutes that were originally edited out.  Whatever happened to these plans they seem to have gotten scrapped at the last minute in the long standing tradition of only offering goofy english dubs of Godzilla movies.  Were this a serious film (AKA Gojira 1954), I think I would be really upset by this, but Tristar's dub is rather funny and serves the fil fairly well as camp (and it is hard to take this film as anything else despite its sometimes jaw dropping miniture effects.)  I very much wish they could start releasing these films in the original language just on principle alone, but I gather they are still waiting for the Japananese DVD market to get up to speed before they start doing that.
Anyway, it is a fun film--I'd definitely recommend this to people who enjoyed the silliness going on in the ghidora/mothra split DVD.",977702400,,980,4.6531791907514455

1282638,3,B00003CXLS,"First the question, How to rate this movie? How many stars? I took a two pronged approach. When compared to other movies out in theaters, it deserves one star. But in the Japanese monster movie genre, I give it five stars. So averaged together, it gets three stars. As we know, Godzilla movies have their own seperate cinematic standards. The 1998 American version was a travesty, as I wrote in my review of it. But back in the hands of Toho, this is pretty much everything we could hope for. Here we see a fair amount of 21st century technical stuff, but then there's that guy in the monster suit. Toho knew just what to update and just what to leave in the old style. Well done! The movie was made with the sensibilities of a Japanese audiance in mind. But we wouldn't have it any other way. Yes, there are some gaping holes in the plot line, as if a few explanatory scenes were left on the cutting room floor. The kid in the movie is about the most annoying kid they've ever featured (and they've had many). The alien spaceship is mesmerizing in its design. The bad guy's almost poetic demise was a nice touch. Watching this movie made me feel like a kid again, taking me back to a much simpler time. Many thanks, Toho! This is well worth having, once the price comes down. Be patient--there will always be a Godzilla.",976579200,6,1321,4.395918367346939
1282639,4,B00003CXLS,"I saw this movie in the theater the first day that it was released and as I left the theater when the film was over I had mixed feelings. I have all the Godzilla movies, toys, games imaginable, but I just couln't get into this movie. Godzilla shows up at the beginning and at the end... the rest of the film is spent talking about Godzilla and a stupid myserious UFO flying around Tokyo. The plot makes no sense (even for a Godzilla movie!), Orgah is the WORST monster imaginable (I mean come on, his hands are bigger tham his body and there stiff through the entire ""battle scene"" if thats what you want to call it), and Godzilla easily kills this ""threat"" in seconds flat. But there are some good points to it as well. Godzilla is one of the best designs of the monster ever, he's got ""Super, Mega, Plasmic, Atomic Breath"" which destroys everything around him, the musical score is really good with classic G-marches and new music and that scene where Godzilla is underwater is totally done in CGI, which is awesome! Although my review probably isn't the best on here, I'm just a simple kid that loves Godzilla in every shape and form... so I give it 4 stars... even though it stunk big time.

1282642,4,B00003CXLS,"Godzilla resurfaces from the Pacific Ocean again, and his immediate  intentions this time are to destroy every nuclear power plant in Japan, whether operating or not.  But that campaign is cut short when the great grey behemoth has to go up against what at first is a rock barried at the bottom of the sea, than a UFO spaceship, than, finally, an oposing monster that mimics the physical characteristics of the creature from Roland Emmerich's 1998 American version of Godzilla.  In fact, there are more than just a few visual similarities between G2K and movies made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (too many to mention) that was probably an intentional effect by director Takao Okawara, seeing the harsh criticism that Devlin and Emmerich recieved because of the derivitive elements in their films.  The prank works much better than one would've thought, and the updated look of Godzilla is quite good, but the pace lags in several spots, becoming down-right boring in the middle, because Godzilla isn't on-screen that much, and the UFO isn't interesting enough to build a strong subplot around.  Things pick up again towards the ending, with the two monsters locked in combat and smashing every usable scaled-down building in sight.  Nice music score.  Hopefully, the next Godzilla picture (Godzilla X MegaGuirus, or something like that) will be released in American theatres, but with G2K only grossing 9.74 million, it seems unlikely.",973382400,2,1441,5.1063829787234045
1282643,5,B00003CXLS,"Produced by Toho as a ""take that"" to the awful American remake from 1998, I thought this Godzilla movie was really great!  I also found it much better than the bloated Series 2 (1984-1995) films, and to be as fun as any of the Series 1 (1954-1975) films!  The story was intriguing, the characters were likeable (and thankfully fewer characters, unlike the Byzantine Series 2 characters), the special effects are impressive (almost to the level of the new Gamera movies, and it even uses some CGI!), there was actually more hardcore monster action (as opposed to the in-your-face laser light shows of the recent films), Takayuki Hattori's music was well done for a non-Akira Ifukube score, and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously!  Godzilla here looks his best yet, and the Millennian/Orga is one of Godzilla's more bizarre adversaries!
Although the public response to this film was surprisingly positive, I was rather discouraged to hear the same words that US critics used to describe Japanese SF films past, such as ""cheesy"" and ""campy.""  Although I don't mind poking fun at Japanese SPFX, I just wish they weren't so meanspirited.  Besides, old fashioned suitamation FX has been improving in Japanese films, especially with the aid of CGI!  You have to give them credit.
I was very happy to see this film in the theater (I saw the Japanese version later on), and that Tri-Star brought this film to the US, partially to apologize to the US fans for that American monstrosity!  I think it's time for the US to appreciate Japanese SPFX, and maintain its fandom in the US.

This is the old-fashioned way, and, indeed, the best way of making kaiju eiga (giant monster movies). Traditional and time-tested techniques have been enhanced with the latest digital technology and CGI. The Godzilla design, known in fandom circles as the Mire-Goji, is simply awesome. The composite shots of Godzilla'a raid early on in the film are very convincing. Godzilla 2000 contains some of the best SPFX of the entire series. The actors turn in inspired performances and the result is that we actually care about what happens to them. Although the main character is Godzilla himself, the relationships between the various leads grow and evolve and are authentically and convincingly portrayed. The battle bewteen Godzilla and the Alien/Millennian is one of the best monster battles in several years.
I left the theatre smiling after having seen one of the most refreshing and well-crafted giant monster movies in a long time. The re-scoring of the film by Peter Robinson was excellent and added greatly to the scenes of Godzilla confronting the military and the final fight to the finish with his monster antagonist.
