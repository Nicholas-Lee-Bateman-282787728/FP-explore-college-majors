6124172,4,B00GY71GJC,So far we've watched Maltese Falcon.  Quality is very good. I think for what is included the price is good for this four movie Blu-ray.,1438214400,,135,4.4
6124173,5,B00GY71GJC,"Many people may complain about some titles not being in this pack. I disagree with those critics! I think this is the perfect Bogart collection with only four selections to utilize. I am 24 years old and love everything I have seen him in. These 4 movies are a catalyst to any younger person looking to broaden their film horizons and get into the films that built the industry.
I was always interested in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre because Paul Thomas Anderson has claimed this is his all-time favorite movie. He also said that he watched the movie every day while they were filming There Will Be Blood (a modern masterpiece, in my opinion). You certainly don't want to miss this movie.
Of course, the other 3 movies are as classic as movies can get. Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, and The African Queen all have their own zest and life that we are not accustomed to in many of today's movies.
The quality of each of these movies in the Blu-ray conversion all seem impressive to me. I am not as technically minded as many of the reviewers will be, but I can say, as an avid movie watcher, that the quality of these discs are worth the price.
Do yourself a favor and blind-buy this pack if you haven't seen all of these movies and consider yourself a fan of movies!",1437436800,8,1272,4.44017094017094
6124174,5,B00GY71GJC,Great Boggy collection.  All discs work great.,1437350400,,46,5.571428571428571
6124175,4,B00GY71GJC,"You know exactly what you are getting from the content standpoint so it seems rather ridiculous to award ""stars"" to a collection that includes Casablanca.  The movies here are all five star worthy and this is not a movie review website, it is a website where we come to look to purchase things and in this case it is a collection of Blu-Rays.

With that being said it would be hard to give this collection fewer than four stars simply because the content is so strong.  But the packaging is not perfect and is not deserving of a perfect score.  The reason, as noted is the decision to stack the discs which can easily lead to damage.  I would note also that I purchased a similar collection at the same time, also stacked and when removing these it was very clear these discs are thinner, they clearly bent removing them, not so much that they didn't play but all were thinner.

My biggest beef was not with the packaging though but in the fact that I use Vudu (the Disc to Digital service supported by just about all major film companies) this lets you register your Blu-Ray discs and for a dollar keep them in the cloud (similar to I-Tunes, but far cheaper).  Thus far I have done this with nearly 200 Blue Rays and have only had issues with two discs.  But in this collection they did not recognize the digital rights to Casablanca or African Queen.  It said the discs did not have the rights on them which is really odd.  I am sure they are not bootlegs but they registered like they were bootlegs.  So I was unable to get digital copies based on the rules the film companies have (understandable).  So just be aware if you plan to purchase and transfer these to digital, unless you rip them to I-Tunes, you will not be able to do so, at least not for two of the best films.",1434499200,12,1778,4.338368580060423

6124181,5,B00GY71GJC,"There are some movies and some actors whose movies I can watch over and over and never get bored with or distracted. These actors and movies are classics and this is one DVD that Bogart fans just have to have. Blu-ray is a real bonus. The Maltese Falcon has the feel of world adventure, well traveled, dangerous characters, tough cops and an experienced gumshoe who plays it close to the vest and isn't above a little larceny. Casablanca is a story of love, lost love and political tension and intrigue in this Moroccan city during WWII. Treasure of the Sierra Madre follows a group of desperate gold miners in the desert of Mexico while one of them goes ""loco"" and leads them to a fight with equally desperate ""Bandidos"". The African Queen co-stars Katherine Hepburn and follows the escape of a rough cut river boat ""captain"" and a British missionary's ""old maid"" sister down a trecherous river in Africa in the wake of an attack by German soldiers on the mission village and murder of the missionary. Bogart's characters are average men who are tenacious in the face of intrigue, danger and action. His characters are often unpredictable and appear to be self serving but when the showdown comes prove to be practical, direct and moral. He is a joy to watch. If you like these films, try ""Key Largo"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""Sahara"" and ""The Petrified Forest"".",1429315200,3,1363,4.683333333333334

Maltese Falcon - great story and well acted. Casablanca was a to be watched and purchased for some time - So now I have all four - Thanks Warner Bros for putting them on Blu Ray.

6124195,5,B00GY71GJC,"All of these films are essential to any legit movie collection.... and all of them are excellently presented on Blu Ray , in fact they are the same discs available as stand alone Blu Ray discs with ALL the bonus features and documentaries so no short cuts are taken there.  The size is a bit smaller than four discs so it's a bit of a space saver. One potential big  flaw in my humble opinion is that there are two posts and two BR discs sit on each post so you have media ""stacked"" on each other instead of 4 separate posts like other 4 disc sets.  I own all the individual movies and bought this to keep at my fiancees apt so I can watch them if I'm so inclined.  Personally I prefer the individual sets with their art and cases but  this is good from a budget standpoint, just be careful with the disc handling.",1396569600,33,814,4.159235668789809
6124196,5,B00GY71GJC,"""The Best of Bogart Collection"" is a bonus-packed assemblage of four movies that can truthfully be called ""Bogie's Best."" All are classics.

""Casablanca"" (1942), one of the most popular, most quoted films of all time, takes place in the title city during World War II. The plot revolves around a couple of letters of transit, an old flame unexpectedly turning up, a corrupt police captain, and a villainous Nazi general. The excellent cast includes Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, and Conrad Veidt. This is Bogart's most famous picture as well as a Best Picture Academy Award winner and, in pristine Blu-ray, it has never looked better. Bonus extras include commentary by Roger Ebert, additional scenes and outtakes, vintage cartoon, and an introduction by Lauren Bacall.

""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) focuses on Sam Spade (Bogart), a partner in a private-eye firm who finds himself hounded by police when his partner is killed while tailing a man. The girl (Mary Astor) who hired him to follow the man turns out not to be who she says she is and is involved in an intrigue with a certain statue of the title bird. This Maltese Falcon is also the obsession of two shady characters, Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet). Bonus extras include commentary by a Bogart biographer, a background featurette, a studio blooper reel, make-up tests, and 3 audio-only radio adaptations.

""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948), has Bogie in Hollywood's definitive action drama about the destructive effects of greed, with an Academy Award-winning performance by Walter Huston. Bonus extras include making-of featurettes, a profile of director John Huston, newsreels, classic cartoons, and a comedy short.

The last film of the collection, ""The African Queen"" (1951) takes place in 1914. Bogart as cantankerous, unkempt sailor Charlie Allnut trades witty repartee with Katharine Hepburn as the outspoken sister of a missionary aboard a rickety boat that they contrive to navigate through rough waters to do their part for the British war effort. A behind-the-scenes featurette chronicles the difficulties of shooting on location in Africa in an era when most motion pictures were shot in studios and on backlots.",1395446400,36,2260,5.234806629834254

8628670,4,B00GY71GJC,"It's Bogart's best non-Bacall films all in one package (If you want the Bacall films check out the Bogie and Bacall DVD collection). Usually you'll find one of these with two or three of his lesser known films, so to get these four together is a treat. These 4 films show the true gamet of Bogart's ability from war-time romantic to noir detective to an insane gold miner, these films are some of the best of the era. But not only do you get good, remastered films, the packaging is sleek and relatively sturdy with 4 post card sized release posters placed in a beautiful Bogart envelope. The only bothersome thing about the packaging, and why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars, is that it doesn't have 4 separate disc holders, it has two, one on each side, then two discs are on each holder.  But each disc is loaded with numerous special features, with film commentary by Bogart biographer Eric Lax on Maltese and Treasure, and a Roger Ebert commentary on Casablanca (Ebert's commentaries are spectacular, I highly recommend his Citizen Kane commentary) as well as multiple featurettes and documentaries on every film. Great buy, totally worth it.",1521244800,,1144,4.72
