8706079,5,B00UGQ2CR2,"Outstanding hard sci-fi series deserved another 5 or more seasons. Excellent storylines, bold characters, intelligent writing, great directing, thoughtful acting and realistic special effects all came together to make this deep space war series better than most in the genre. Space Above & Beyond is closer in tone to Mass Effect than the cynicism of Starship Troopers, the eternal optimism of Star Trek, or the murky mysticism of Star Wars. Space Above & Beyond instead opts for honor, integrity and patriotism to defend Earth from it's extraterrestrial enemies. Very highly recommended.",1520035200,,588,5.472527472527473
