8030518,5,B0002PUGV6,"I still can't stop laughing. Todd Andrew Bryant (writer, producer, star) turns the angst of a father-to-be into an amusing comedy as he reverses roles with his father -- played by Tim Conway -- who is at his best, ad-libbing and making co-stars struggle with composure. I especially enjoyed the restaurant fiasco!",1216598400,,313,5.038461538461538
