8700989,1,B00T94R4NE,"The back of the dvd case says 16X9 (1:78:1) aspect ratio widescreen . The previews are in widescreen, but the documentaries are in 4X3  (1:33:1) aspect ratio. So if you have a widescreen tv then there will be black bars on the side and top making a black square surrounding the picture. It also makes the picture smaller. If you have an older 4X3 display the picture should fill it just find. But most people have 16X9 displays and thats all that has been sold in the last few years. What were they thinking? The documentaries were shown on the History HD channel. So I assumed that the dvds would at least be in a 16X9(1:78:1) aspect ratio. Even though I know that this set of dvds are SD instead of HD. You can still have 16X9(1:78:1) SD movies and documentaries. No excuse for this. I didn't buy this off of Amazon but from another retailer in a actual store were I read it carefully before buying. I am sure Amazon would have made it right if I bought off of them.  I feel really ripped off and mislead.",1430524800,,1007,4.322751322751323
