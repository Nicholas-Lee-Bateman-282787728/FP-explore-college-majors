7934204,4,B000059TNZ,"The review for Amazon.com (and Amazon.ca) by ""waxone"" gives an accurate account of ""Best Boy"" (Pride Video PRI-31039, in North America), along with a surely unnecessarily severe rating (a low one of a single star). The video really is worth acquiring for gay men (and for women who enjoy this kind of male erotica) despite its limitations and flaws. ""Best Boy"" does not have the artistic and polished effect of the more skillfully crafted erotica in Pride Video's interesting catalogue, but the sheer beauty and variety of the men more than compensate. There is something (somebody, that is) for any woman or gay man, apart from ""bears"" or other heavily hirsute men, who are notable only for their absence from this video.

The technical flaws that somewhat lessen the quality and impact of this video occur only occasionally, but nonetheless, are a bit irksome. There are glitches visually in part of one segment (flickering image albeit still viewable, with colour leaching, at least on the copy which I acquired) for the exceptionally beautiful and sleekly, youthfully virile Italian stud, ""Federico"", in his solo scene in a Turkish bath on the Italian Riviera, but, fortunately, his sexy duo with another attractive young dude (""Leif"", supposedly Scandanavian, but who looks as though he could be Federico's equally Italian brother or cousin) is more uniformly well filmed. At times here and there on the video, colour turns to black and white momentarily for no apparent reason, then suddenly reverts to colour.  There are glitches, too, in the sound track at several points, but they are less bothersome than the low musical level to which some of these musical concoctions, largely electro-acoustical, stoop.

Most of the ""solo sex"" scenes of these lads are of self-gratification and arousal (with some attention to manipulating a partner's sex organs, when there are two men); there are a few among the couples interspersed among the ""solos"" who abet each other's mutually receiprocated arousal, but without proceding on to sexual oral or anal penetration. One of the solos, amusingly and rather fetishistically, is that of ""Stevie"" polishing his motorcycle with cleaning rags and his own clothing, then mounting and reclining on his big road machine as he self-pleasures himself.  A  goodly preponderance of the other segments take place in open-air pool or other waterside settings, as well as in woodland surroundings. The little conceit of the voyeuristic narrator disappears after the first few mini-scenes, rather, for me (in contrast to how ""waxone"" reacts), to some minimal loss in the remainder of the video's charm, a matter, however, about which viewers will differ considerably, but that is of little moment.

I especially fancy the Italian and French young men (e.g., besides the gloriously handsome Federico, there is among them ""Pierre"", the French lad of exquisitely chiselled face and body alike), who are wonderfully ""latin"" in look and physically quite fit. However, the Teutonic/Scandanavian, Slavic, Hellenic, and even the British lads are almost all exceptionally good-looking men, too, each in his own way. This video may not attain the artistic level of some of Pride Video's other gay erotica, but it is quite satisfying on its own terms.

Any extra feature of real importance is limited to a photo gallery, which has still views of very few if any of the men in the filmed scenes, and in these shots many of the men are older than the lads tend to be in the filmed scenes, who (judging from their appearance) are in late adolescence or their twenties. If the reader enjoys this kind of thing, he will know whether or not this video is one for him.",1304467200,,3681,5.0543657331136735

7934206,1,B000059TNZ,"Some GORGEOUS man/boys in this one, but the incipit british voice attempting to ""narrate"" the first of the 3 vignettes could have and should be replaced by music. Turn down the volume, and enjoy the beauty of man/boyhood - even tho it is NOT hard core, the ""boys"" are pretty to look at. As a smut fan, this is very disapointing as the annoying arm, elbow, or knee gets in the way of what I want to see, but all in all, the boys are pretty, even if most of them are straight - or asexual (how can you be kissed passionately and not get even a little sroused?) In many scenes, you can almost hear the director giving directions... Pretty boys, no plot, no real action, a voyers disapointment, but I am glad I own it.",1024704000,14,714,4.218978102189781
