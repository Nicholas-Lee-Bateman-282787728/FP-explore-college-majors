3617196,5,B001GP5TL8,"I absolutely love this video.  After a long day of work I use to find it difficult to get my self out of the couch and do a daily workout.  But 12 minutes doesn't seem difficult, and helps me overcome the reluctance to work out.  And usually after I do a 12-min session I feel more energized.  I especially love the toning sessions, as I have done it for about 2 weeks now and have been feeling results!",1232582400,63,403,4.128205128205129
3617197,5,B001GP5TL8,"This DVD is just perfect for me, a mom of three little ones.  There are six 12 minute ""daily dozens,"" such as Yoga Stretch and Cardio Kickboxing Burn.  There are 12 moves in each daily dozen segment lasting a minute each.  I always followed Denise Austin on her Lifetime TV half hour program, but when it was cancelled was at a loss for a short program I could do daily.  Now, I pop this DVD in an am able to select one twelve minute workout, or several, lasting longer if I have the time.  I would say the workouts are easier than some of her other workout videos, pretty much because once you get tired of one move, she is already onto the next.  I would describe myself as a beginner to moderate ""work-outer.""  Denise Austin, as always, is just an absolute sweet and encouraging person: I don't like to work out without her cheering me on!  I have so many of her workouts already, and she has been doing this for years and years for a reason!",1231632000,158,945,4.269662921348314
3617198,5,B001GP5TL8,"I have always been a fan of Denise Austin and was thrilled when this DVD came out.  Denise is her usual perky self and really helps you get the most out of your exercise time.  When you turn on the DVD it gives you two options, Denise's recommended layout and Customize your own.  If you choose Denise's it tells you which 12 minute segment to do depending on the day of the week.  I like this set up so it is easier to remember what you need to do to shape up.  I am hoping for good results.  Although I must say anytime I have ever done any Denise videos I have always gotten results....",1230768000,65,589,4.078260869565217

If you only have a small amount of time this is the video for you but you can also put together the videos for a longer exercise period.  You really work up a sweat in the 12 minutes.

This DVD is one of her newest additions, , I am enjoying the variety and intensity that the 12-minute a day work out provides.  If you have aching knees and/or prone to sore muscles, this work out and all of the Denise Austin series provide protection from injury, along with providing work out suggestions and additional readings.
My commitment to exercise started in a college in a beginning weight training class, and, I've worked out weekly every since.  Like new fragrances, I have tried other fitness gurus, but, somehow make my way back to the Denise Austin brand of work-outs.

3617304,5,B001GP5TL8,"This workout is great and the accompanying book is fantastic (simple, easy meal plans to lose up to 12 pounds in  2 weeks).  I have worked out with Denise Austin for 15+ years and I still have all her dvds (some are really goofy -- like from the 80's!! but a workout is a workout).  I never mind working out with Denise...I always look forward to it...which is definitely not true for most of the other workout dvd's I own.  Everybody seems to think Denise's workouts are super easy...they're not!!  They are challenging and adaptable for every workout level.  What I have learned from experience is that it is not necessary to do crazy ""killer"" workouts (TurboFire, Insanity, etc...) to get the results that you want.  Most of the time these types of workouts do more harm than good and can lead to serious injuries.  I have never incurred an injury with Denise...I feel energized and motivated and positive about what I've done...being a busy Mom...I consider it quite an accomplishment if I can fit that workout into my schedule!  This dvd workout is one of my very favorites...it's challenging but easy to fit into a busy life b/c it's broken up into 12 minute segments -- and those segments are fun and motivating.  By the way, I did purchase 21 Day Fix...and I really love that...it's a great program for anyone...you know what else?  It's a total rip-off from this...yep...read Denise's Daily Dozen book and you will see what I mean...even the exercises are almost identical...nothing wrong with that but for me it just proves that Denise really is the original, real-deal!  You can't go wrong with Denise or this workout.",1437091200,16,1629,4.73758865248227

3617306,5,B001GP5TL8,you can fit this workout into your day,1436572800,,38,3.875
3617307,4,B001GP5TL8,"I like it...I like the idea of going to the gym regularly but it's like an ""expense"" these days. I will watch and follow along with this DVD program on the wintertime days, rainy days, when going for a walk comfortably isn't feasible. I like cardio the most, but I do realize that you need a good half-hour to get the full benefits of cardio aerobics. So it takes about two or three of the moves (the cardio kickbox, and cardio athletic fat blast) to equal one ""full"" workout. The yoga stretch moves are good for that ""cooling down"" period. Also I noticed that the Yoga Stretch moves for Saturday and Sunday looked identical.( I think they are) Sometimes I might do one of the cardio, one sculpt, and one yoga stretch. I think Ms Austin intended for this program to be targeted to the busy -working-mom demographic (I don't belong to that one) which is why it was created with a ""squeeze it in your routine"" feel to it.

I actually don't own many workout videos or DVDs...I just felt like I needed something in addition to the stationary bike and treadmill standard and a program to use for rainy days. She's very perky (but most fitness instructors are, it almost sounds phony, but I guess it helps us keep our spirits up) and looks just like my neighbor's daughter who was a tall blonde Majorette in high school (Of course, in the video she looks more ""regular"")

You only need a set of light weights, and a good workout mat as well, especially for the yoga/sculpt workouts.",1436140800,,1476,4.483271375464684
3617308,5,B001GP5TL8,She is pretty good....,1433462400,,22,4.75
3617318,4,B001GP5TL8,"I like this workout, although it's not as challenging as a Jillian Michaels workout by any means.  Each 12 minute ""daily dozen"" works out a different zone.  You can do all 6 days, or just one day at a time, or mix and match at will. If you do 3 sections in a row you'll probably work up a sweat.

The Yoga Stretches are not very Yoga and that's a good thing in my opinion.  I didn't try that portion for a long time because I was expecting the usual poses (warrior, mountain, sun salutation, triangle, camel, etc.), but none of them were used.  It was just a good stretching session and I appreciated that.  An osteopath told me that more people slip disks doing Yoga than any other activity.  I'm kind of over the whole Yoga practice myself.

There's no pain in these exercises, yet your muscles will feel worked. It's perfect for beginners, anyone who's had an injury or if you'd just like some easier days between the more difficult exercises in your repertoire.",1432166400,2,965,4.443181818181818
3617319,4,B001GP5TL8,"I've been working out with this video for over 3 years and never get bored of it. I've tried other workouts but always end up going back to Denise. 12 minutes is doable, and I find I'm less likely to procrastinate.  I actually only do the aerobic workouts and have them memorized. I remember her back in the 90s and thought her to be a bit annoying, but she certainly does keep you motivated.  This is not for advanced exercisers who may be used to 45 min-1 hour fast paced classes. It's challenging enough for me as an intermediate exerciser; and I suspect would be quite hard at first for a beginner - but remember it's only 12 minutes.

Dropped a star, because like other reviewers mentioned she makes a few mistakes, and I think she should have a separate segment where she explains the moves.  This made it a bit difficult at the beginning, but once you've memorized the moves, it's not a problem.  I think the reason she doesn't explain the moves during the video is because it would slow it down and add more time - which is why she should have added a separate segment.  I would recommend this video to beginner and intermediate exercisers who are struggling to find the time to work out, but could squeeze in 12 minutes a day.",1430092800,5,1235,4.418502202643172

The first one is good and my favorite of the group. Wednesdays has lots of kicking and is pretty intense. Thursday includes weight, upper body sculpt/abs, and is done on the floor (mat is a good idea). Both Saturday and Sunday are the same yoga workout, which involves stretching, and feels pretty good but is not cardio. I would recommend this one to anyone who is at an intermediate level with working out--I am a senior citizen and work out at least 30 minutes every day (including weekends).

The workouts are not super difficult, but if you haven't worked out in a while, you'll feel it the next day. As always, Denise Austin is very motivating and I feel energized and encourage to work out with her coaching. The only con, the setting is not fun. No beach or other soothing background. Panels and spotlights, that's it.
Will definitely keep this dvd in my workout rotation!",1402272000,2,512,4.516129032258065

She offers very little instruction and is difficult to keep up with.  I ordered several of her videos.  The 20 minute workouts would be good if she would give you some warning when she is changing her moves.,1357603200,,348,4.4603174603174605

My justification for this particular video was at a minimum I can exercise for 12 minutes every day.  The workout sequence is great with three days of cardio, two of sculpting/toning, and two of yoga/stretching.  I have found that these sessions move quickly so before you know it 12 minutes has past.  You do work up a sweat in the cardio sessions.  Now I often times pair two sessions together for a longer work out.  My message about this product is that anyone has 12 minutes and this video is worth it.",1349049600,4,645,4.369747899159663

I like that I can pick whatever day I want to do.  I can do Monday and Thursday, Sunday and Tuesday, or do everyday if decide.  Great for those who don't have a lot of time to exercise, but would like to get something in.  They are quick and effective.

The exercises are easy to do and remember, so I can do them without the DVD when I'm not at home.  Each day's exercises target different muscle groups which is great and it shows you the types of things you can do to tone different areas.  I like the cardio stuff every other day with weights and ab work in between.  It does get a little boring after doing it for several months, but don't get rid of it because it does you a lot of good. This is my workout on days that I can't go swimming, walking/running or bike riding and the yoga stretches are great on the weekend (I only do them one day -- I do something else physical on the other day), because they remind me how much stretching you need to do as you get older.

Its great because everyone has 12 minutes a day to burn some extra calories! My favorites are the cardio athlete and kick box.

Having said that, I am very disappointed in my inability to keep up with the moves.  The moves seem more complex than I am used to and having gone back three times now I am just not getting it.  It may just be me.  On the positive side I think this instructor has a lot of energy and if I could get the moves down it would be a nice change of pace.

For reference I have been doing the body sculpting and cardio workouts from the Biggest Loser people and Jillian for about 10 months now without an issue.  I am in reasonably good shape although I will admit to having bad knees.",1287273600,7,703,4.050724637681159

I do like that you can choose which 12 minute workout you want or combine them to do more. I like the exercises Denise uses and they do give me a variety. However, I think some of them are done too fast to do correctly and some of them you only do a few repetitions before the next one starts. Denise gets off count, says one thing and does another, and makes it kind of hard to follow. It's not a bad workout, but I think Denise is just in a big hurry on this one.",1285372800,4,590,3.925

The routines are not long enough individually to be boring so the time flies by.  You can program the DVD to suit your style.  The only reason I didn't give the workout 5 stars is that Denise's queing isn't very good compared to other instructors that I favor.

What I don't like: her backup dancers either didn't come to rehearsal or Denise didn't have any rehearsals with them. They are out of sync and it gets distracting to me. I'm not going to fault the dancers though because Denise sometimes gives unclear directions or says that you only have two reps left and then goes on to do four more. You'd think that after being in this business for so many years and producing so many videos that she'd know how to lead a video by now.",1268611200,3,541,4.356435643564357

I have found Denise Austin to be very motivating and very genuine.  I have picked her DVDs that have shorter segments as I find it EASIER for me to commit to doing just 12 minutes of exercise and then I actually do it (whereas if it were 45 minutes, I would certainly find an excuse NOT to do it).  It then usually turns into doing another segment (10 to 20 minutes) and I find breaking my exercise into segments makes me achieve longer workouts.  I hate 50 minute videos that I feel like, ""will this ever end?""  Also, I think Denise's style is very good at keeping you moving and not thinking about the clock.  She switches it up so much I forget to wonder how much more until the end.  If you don't like her personality- why in the world would you buy her DVD?  She has been doing this for 20+ years, and she is who she is- and I just love her!  She is exactly what I needed to finally get motivated to really get in shape.",1266969600,14,1080,4.05188679245283

In spite of all that, I nearly twisted my ankle doing this workout.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it for the most part up to that point, but I have somewhat limited space in my living room, and the video jumps from exercise to exercise.  I would recommend this video if you are short on time, or you want a decent lighter workout for those like me who will choose to select all the sections at once; the workout certainly made me sweat.  The two cardio sections were very good even though I would recommend modifying a few of the more dangerous moves (personally I would rather do something harder but less perilous then those half jumping jack twist things).  The lower body section was alright, but not really challenging, and the upper body was hard for me, but all I have is 10 lb weights.  I think 5 lbs would probably work better.  As for the yoga, it was a great stretch segment for the workout dvd as a whole, but as yoga by itself it would really suck!  I think next time I will go with Leslie Sansone or just stick with a youtube playlist full of sparkpeople Coach Nicole 10 minute cardio workouts, but this video was only 10 dollars, so I am not terribly disappointed.",1264377600,4,1363,4.380952380952381

I didn't care for them because I'm more interested in a complete workout as opposed to quick segments.  I found the segments to be too jerky and could easily cause injury.  Athletic types who want to incorporate the workouts into a total fitness program might find these helpful, but for the more average person, they may not work so well.",1255305600,2,420,4.573333333333333

I thought on some days I could cut my time down on the machine and follow either one or two of her 12 minutes segments instead. I felt that the cardio portions on the DVD gave me more of a workout then I'd ever felt on the machine! The toning ones are pretty good too. Now I often get off the machine after just 20 minutes then do one of the cardio and one of the toning segments and feel I've gotten a better, full body workout then I could have if I'd stayed on the machine. The only reason the DVD was given just 4 stars is that I have better stretching/yoga DVD's, but what Denise offers in the last ""yoga stretch"" segment is ""good enough"". It's the same for both Saturday and Sunday and it would have been nice to have them be two different segements but that wouldn't be a reason not to purchase this DVD to vary a boring workout.",1251417600,6,943,4.186813186813187

The workouts focus on different parts of the body, and the 12 different exercises in 12 min keep it from getting boring. The best part about the DVD is Denise.

I read some reviews about the cueing and I don't really know what that means.  I just workout to the best of my ability and I think that it is Denise's intention that we're not perfect and have to match each movement she makes.

3617764,4,B001GP5TL8,"This DVD was just OK. I wasn't bowled over by it although I did get my heart rate up and sweat. I've done two of the twelve minute routines (Cardio-Athletic Blast and Cardio-Kickbox Burn). I was going to add on the 12 minute yoga stretch but I was bored to tears. I like when I'm so into a workout that my eyes are not glued to the DVD timer counting down to when it's over. Overall, it's a good DVD especially if you're really tight on time and/or just starting out. The routines were varied, i.e. you weren't doing the same move for too too long. Maybe I'm just too used to Denise Austin to appreciate the DVD. Her Blast Away 10 Lbs., though, is still the best that she's done to date in my opinion and it's one of my favorites.",1236643200,8,730,4.147887323943662
3617765,5,B001GP5TL8,"Sometimes you only have a few minutes to get in a good workout and now you can choose from 5 different 12 minute workouts depending on your mood.  Choose from Cardio-Athletic Fat Blast, Lower Body Scult/Abs, Cardio Kickbox Burn, Upper Body Sculpt/Abs, and Yoga Stretch.  You can pick a different workout each day or combine more than one to create your own longer workout.  I love Denise Austin's workouts because she has low - moderate impact workouts with 3 levels of intensity and she has a very positive and encouraging attitude.  I highly recommend this vidoe.",1235952000,13,565,4.854166666666667
3617766,5,B001GP5TL8,"I really like this DVD.  As a stay-at-home-mom of 2 boys, there are days I can just get in a short workout.  If I have more time, I put 2 of the sessions together.  So many reviews of Denise Austin say they can't stand her voice.  This has the option of working out with her instruction or just with music.",1235174400,6,306,4.05

3617769,5,B001GP5TL8,"I have been looking for something to replace the Denise Austin TV workout.  This is the perfect workout to replace the cancelled TV show.  Everyday I do the Saturday or Sunday Yoga - then the day of the week workout - then the Saturday or Sunday Yoga to cool down.
The music is so great.  I do the workouts with music only.  Sometimes I just put the music on and do my house work.  It gets you moving.
I would recommend listening to Denise a few times until you learn all the pointers about the workout then switch to music only and have fun!

3617770,4,B001GP5TL8,"I like Denise even though her cueing is horrible and she sometimes seems lost and a just a step behind during her workout videos.  This video is the same, BUT I love the two cardio segments due to the variety.  They aren't the most difficult for sure, but on a light day I like to complete them both + the stretch segment which is GREAT.  I often add this stretch to my other more difficult videos.  I tried the upper body segment though and hated it.. the movements were off and seemed way too rushed for a good strength workout.  Overall though, a good workout to have around ~ and for beginners, this would be a great start.",1233792000,11,627,4.279661016949152

8306482,4,B001GP5TL8,"If you are middle aged and starting from fitness ground zero (as I am) be gracious with yourself and go easy.  The routines are easy to follow, but kind of challenging and it's easy to go from ""good workout"" to ""wow am I sore"".  I suggest modifying anything ""too hard"" till you are more fit, which is what I did.

I hate repetitive workouts, so these videos of hers with lots of options and customization are great!",1527120000,,415,4.363636363636363
