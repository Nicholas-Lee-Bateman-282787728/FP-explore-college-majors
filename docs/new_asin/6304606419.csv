2. Loonette dolls
2. Molly dolls
Granny Garbonzo
Major Bedhead
Snicklefritz
Dustbunnies names are Fuzzy & Wuzzy.
Someday we will find Auntie MacAssar dolls & Wobbly too!
I used to have this video on Big Comfy Couch on Red Light, Green Light but, we gave it away but someday I will order Big Comfy Couch videos and I love them!
""OH! Little boy! You should never chase you're ball out into the road like that! It's very dangerous! You saved my life Molly? Thank you."" That is a line from this video.
They used their couch and pretended it was a car.
In this video they played the statchue game and music was on and it played and you run around and freeze as a statchue and the music stops too.
I love this video and show on Treehouse T. V.
I sure loved this video!",1011139200,3,879,4.116279069767442
