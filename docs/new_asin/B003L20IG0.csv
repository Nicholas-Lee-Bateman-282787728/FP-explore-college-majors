4136174,3,B003L20IG0,"This was an odd movie to rate. The first half was just wasted film footage. The second half of the movie heats up but some parts were simply too far fetched to believe like the cop repeatedly spotting Crowe & his wife in a Crowded stadium filled with thousands of people in attendance. Just too coincidental, too often. But, then things skyrocket as we move along into the culmination. Good action, good cat & mouse game, good cunning by the runaways. Things that once looked preposterous start to add up. A tale of two parts. Decent enough if you persevere until the end and can stomach the wife's ridiculous behavior. She's mad about being incarcerated but mad about her husband's attempt to free her so she repeatedly jeopardizes the lives and well being of herself, her husband and their kid. Jeez, she was sickening.",1295827200,2,821,4.708333333333333
4136175,5,B003L20IG0,"i wasn't expecting a lot seeing this movie. A pleasant surprise. I haven't enjoyed too many of Russell Crowe's movies, but really liked this one. Crowe and the rest of the cast are excellent set amongst the gorgeous surrounding of the Pittsburgh area. A good choice to set the film in....the area is one of the nicest (if not the nicest) big city areas in the country. I used to live in that area and after living in various other places across the country, i really wish i was back there!
The film is definitely one that bears ""repeat-watchings"" so i will be definitely buying the blu-ray disc come release day. Highly recommended.",1294790400,9,632,4.601769911504425
4136176,5,B003L20IG0,"Just like I said on the title, is what this movie is all about. A woman that is accussed of murdering her boss and after a while, Russell Crowe, does the unthinkable. He finds a way to get his wife out of jail and move out of the country.

The movie is great and it gets very very intense towards the end where all the action and suspense is taking place.

4136177,3,B003L20IG0,"Once you realize, once you get how ""The Next Three Days"" will unfold, the movie becomes more an exercise than anything else. As a result, it becomes a little boring.

John and Lara Brennan (Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks) are very happily married and have a three year old son, Luke. One morning, the police storm into their home and arrest Lara for the murder of her boss. Three years later, all of the appeals and most of the money are gone and this means Lara will soon be moved  from her temporary home in a large jail to a penitentiary further away, making the frequent family visits difficult. John has to act fast, for the sake of his family, because Lara will not be able to survive the harder life of the maximum security facility. Out of desperation, he contacts Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), a former convict who wrote a book about his own prison break. He tells John that if he goes through with this plan, he will have a very limited time frame to complete the plan and to do things he might not be prepared to do. John spends a lot of time sitting, watching, planning and then he notices something providing the beginning of the escape plan. He begins to plot everything, and I mean everything, out to the smallest detail on his bedroom wall.

Written and directed by Paul Haggis (""Crash"", ""In the Valley of Elah""), ""The Next Three Days"" moves at a fast pace, yet still seems to be an overly long film. It is a misstep for the filmmaker who usually creates far superior films.

The story opens with Crowe and Banks out at dinner with his brother and sister-in-law. The two women get into a fight and the dinner breaks up early. But John  and Lara can barely get back to their car before they start ripping their clothes off. The next morning, mom takes a picture of the family, her daily ritual which John deems corny. Then the police burst in and arrest Lara. I'm all for keeping things moving, but this pacing means we have just witnessed all of the scenes Haggis will allow us to get to know about the Brennan's family life. This is an important thing for us to have a good feel for because John will risk everything in his attempt to break his wife out of jail. We have to believe they are madly, passionately in love, so in love that every day of her incarceration seems an eternity. It is a very short period of screen time, of narrative, to build such emotions. We also have to believe every day of Lara's separation from her family is slowly killing her because she misses her husband and son. Both have to be established for us to care, to give a flying fig about whether John is successful or not. It has to be enough to hook us. These brief moments aren't enough to make this work. But Haggis makes an agreement with us. He almost verbally asks us to go along with him for the ride, he'll spend some more time exploring the family dynamic throughout the film.

Haggis does deliver on this promise and we get a more complete picture of this small family's dynamic. John's willingness to go to such great lengths seems perfectly normal to us.

Haggis is a respected screenwriter and has contributed to many memorable films in addition to the films he writes and directs. You don't get to this point if you can't write a good story or craft memorable, believable dialogue. In ""Three Days"", Haggis seems to concentrate on the plot. Everything is centered around Crowe's attempts to break Banks out of prison. He sits, watches and comes up with a plan. But Haggis is smart enough to throw in some monkey wrenches, the plan can't be too pat or it will become boring. To make things interesting, Crowe will have to change his mind a few times, usually at the last minute.

Haggis also introduces elements giving a richer subtext to the story. Many of these same moments will also pay off later, making the story more emotionally satisfying. For instance, when John and Lara are having breakfast, she reminds her husband to call his father (Brian Dennehy) and wish him a ""Happy Birthday"". This allows Haggis to give us a little background about John's relationship with his dad. It isn't a good relationship. Later, as John begins to put his plan together, he leaves his son with his dad and mom. Later, an emotional moment, true to our knowledge of the nature of these characters proves satisfying.

As John moves through his plan, putting together all of the pieces, we witness the different emotions playing on his face and in his body language. At one point, John is about to make a bad decision, desperate to close one part of the overall plan. We know it will end badly if he goes through with it. We want to shout at him, tell him to stop. And he seems to hear us. He changes his mind and chooses an equally dangerous, but with slightly better odds.

As he goes though these moments, he caresses his son's head, or looks at him with a faraway look. These moments are effective but seem too brief. They get the right feeling across but because we don't live with them, we don't feel them through these characters as we need to. Because John is putting together something so dangerous, we have to believe everything is at stake. If we don't connect with any member of the family, we can't completely invest in the story.

When the plan kicks into gear, John moves methodically through the motions. But Haggis throws in some of those monkey wrenches and forces John to make some decisions on the fly.

Throughout the film, the two cops (Jason Beghe, lots of TV appearances, and Aisha Hinds, TV's ""Detroit 187"" and ""Hawthorne"") who arrest Lara, are in the background, working to make sure Lara is sent away, to pay for her crime. They pop up occasionally, to remind us of their presence. Then, as John puts his plan in motion, two more detectives (Lennie James and Allan Steele) enter the picture and start to realize what John might be attempting. As all four start to work to find John, the first two detectives begin to think maybe Lara is innocent. Honestly, this is a weak and unbelievable part of the movie. So much so it brings the entire film down a few notches. There is also a coda featuring the first two detectives which is almost maddening, and not for the right reasons.

John's plan is an elaborate Rube Goldberg contraption. Everything hinges on a number of things happening at precisely the right moment. And everything hinges on one thing happening over and over again. Once you realize what this is, the movie loses momentum because it no longer has any suspense.

Crowe has had a difficult few years. His last few films have been commercial and, in many case, critical flops. In ""Three Days"", his portrayal of John Brennan is not perhaps the most emotional he has ever done. In fact, it feels a little flat because he spends a lot of time sitting and watching. When he does have an emotional moment, they almost seem more perceived than something actually witnessed.

Banks, more commonly known for her roles in extremely popular comedies, shows she can handle more dramatic roles. She quickly establishes her role in the family (she has to) and when she is incarcerated, we see the pain and uncertainty in her face.

""The Next Three Days"" holds your attention, but still manages to seem over long and even a little boring.",1291420800,9,7268,4.545107033639144
4136178,2,B003L20IG0,"Is it too much to hope that, when a studio has the wherewithal - and budget - to pull together such cinematic luminaries as Russell Crowe, Brian Dennehy and Liam Neeson, that it won't insult its audience's intelligence with the result? Once upon a time, Hollywood threw its big name stars challenging roles, and they produced erudite, artful, memorable and, well, *thrilling* thrillers, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000MGB6N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Confidential/dp/B000Q8QH0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A.

Nowadays the best you'll get is lightweight fluff like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knight-and-Day/dp/B0045ASBNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knight and Day</a>, and formulaic rubbish like Three Days Left - or whatever this film was called: I am honestly already having trouble remembering. My wife and I sat in a bar afterwards and tried to look on the bright side just to think of something nice to say. At least it wasn't in 3D.

This film assembles a (mostly) talented, but (altogether) wasted, big name cast, including one of my favourite, underrated, actors of all time: Brian Dennehy. But Dennehy was so starved of script I wondered at one point whether the actor (now in his seventies) had suffered a stroke and was unable to speak. Joy of joys, eventually he did, briefly, and managed in a couple of stares to generate more acting quality than the rest of the cast put together. Liam Neeson played some sort of escape artist ex-con with a comedy Bronx accent, a Hemingway cap and a preposterous scar across his cheek: he may as well have had a parrot on his shoulder and a wooden leg for the sense his character made (although then he would be less able to ride the motorcycle which the scriptwriters had bestowed on him). Russell Crowe - an actor who has fashioned a career from being a moody, sexy, hard bastard - plays John Brennan, an overweight, credulous and downright wet schoolteacher whose wife is subject to a horrendous miscarriage of justice.

Except - and it pains me to admit I'm legally qualified, but I am - I don't think it *was* a miscarriage of justice. More importantly, Brennan is given no cause throughout the film, save guileless and gullible belief in the blamelessness of his wife, to think so either. And nor does director Paul Haggis invest any time in ensuring we are sympathetic to Laura Brennan's cause. Haggis' pedigree is James Bond screenwriting, so I don't suppose he has ever needed to bother establishing his hero, but here the film was lost within the first ten minutes when, in the course of a single petulant exchange, we are introduced to, and invited to immediately dislike, Laura Brennan, a fractious, humourless woman in a blonde wig who is easily baited by her sister-in-law. The fact that Laura lovingly shags her husband in the car afterwards and insists on taking a photo of their nuclear family every day doesn't substitute for decent emotional investment. We actively dislike Laura, and little of her behaviour afterwards does anything to change this. Even her son patently dislikes her.

From this unpromising tableau we are led onto John Brennan's thoroughly implausible journey from wet English teacher lecturing on Don Quixote (which would have been funny and clever if Brennan hadn't misrepresented a farce as tragedy) to criminal mastermind, springing his irritating wife from maximum security clink towards a South American lam. This involves preparation: is convention dictates, Brennan duly erects a wall map of his plan: a map of Pittsburgh, photos of security vans, lines joining up all the dots (you know the drill), including, unfathomably, scrawling a budget for the heist on the map, and useful reminders ""GET A FALSE MOUSTACHE"" etc.  ""AND HAT"". Brennan assembles a cast of low life characters (including Neeson and a lip-reading deaf chap, also on a motorbike) to help him execute his plan. Oh, and YouTube, of course, which will tell you how to pick prison locks and open security vans armed only with an old tennis ball.

All this to save a highly strung and glacial wife who can't even maintain the affection of her mop-headed son, and who shows no gratitude for her husband's loyalty, no matter how misplaced or, er, quixotic. During his preparation John Brennan encounters a lonesome single mum who inveigles him with come-hither looks, but showing the resolve of a rather deluded saint, merely uses her to effect his plan.

You won't be surprised to hear that cuddly schoolteacher makes a better fist of his ludicrous plan than logic would dictate he ought. The last part of the film descends into a frenetic chase across beautiful Pittsburgh (talk about quixotic: Haggis attempts some scene setting shots intended to make Pittsburgh look picturesque), and as convention dictates, the police are by turns brilliant to the point of clairvoyance when tracking and nearly catching him, but moronic beyond belief in the last five yards when apprehension is finally at hand. Not that I wasn't rooting for the hapless cops: wouldn't it be a lovely turn of events if, just once, the perpetually doomed coppers actually got their man?

I seem to say this a lot of films, and it depresses me to have to: check your brain at the door, and the two hours will pass quickly enough. But killing time is hardly enough reason to part with a tenner and sit in a dark room.

For once,  wouldn't it be nice to take your brain in with you to the cinema?

4136179,3,B003L20IG0,"It could have been GREAT! Russell Crowe is outstanding in everything he does and probably one of the best actors of our time. In every role he plays, he puts everything he has into it. ""The Next Three Days"" is no exception. Crowe is on top of his game, as is the rest of the cast, especially Elizabeth Banks. It's good to see her taking on roles with more substance, and after seeing her here, she has reinvented herself after taking on the sappy and unbelievable role of Miri in ""Zack And Miri Make A Porno."" I mean, really, a beautiful woman like that making whoopee with Seth Rogan? C'mon, man...not a chance in h-e-double toothpicks!

Anyway, the problem with Three Days wasn't the cast or the production. It was the directing, story editing, and length. There were so many pointless scenes in the first two-thirds of the movie that I could count numerous times the attending masses could get up to retrieve a tub of popcorn, go to the restroom, and subsequently stand outside to watch the cars enter the theater parking lot for five or ten minutes and still not miss anything by the time they all got back. The entire playground scene with the little girl playing ""Tag"" is a prime example. Was that necessary? Absolutely not! It was almost as if they had so little storyline that they created a ton of needless material to fill in the space and then got carried away with it. A majority of this movie should have ended up on the editing floor. Once it was edited properly, and the movie then topped out as an excellent suspense thriller, they could have released it on DVD as an ""Uncut Version"" or ""Director's Cut"" with all the extra junk thrown in there. That would have made much more sense. The only thing that should have focused on in the beginning was getting the viewer to contemplate whether Crowe's character's actions were moral in a humane sense or clinically insane. Nothing more. They achieved this but with far too much baggage brought along for the trip. The main problem with Russell's character, though, is that it is highly unlikely that a history teacher is going to transform into a prison-break artist...no matter what he/she's up against. The proper way to approach this might have been to do some investigating of his own to try and determine her innocence or guilt. Two wrongs don't make a right, and that would pertain to this flick as well. (Slang)>Two-thirds of this movie is wrong, so that don't make it right.<(Slang) Right?

The last twenty minutes or so of the movie was excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat suspense that barely made up for the slow, drudging beginning.

All in all, for me, this movie gets three stars for casting, acting, and the last twenty minutes...or two stars taken away for poor directing and editing. Either way, it's not any more than a three-star movie. Not bad, not great, 50-50. ***",1290729600,5,2853,4.679282868525896
4136180,4,B003L20IG0,"""The Next Three Days"" is a tight, hard-hitting thriller that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. I really didn't know, right up to the final moments, how it would end - and because the film had expertly guided me to care about all the characters, even some random losers in a meth lab, I did care about how it would end. The actors are all good with Russell Crowe especially so, and the realistically gritty sets perfectly match the film's desperate tone. Elizabeth Banks' too-good-to-be-true wholesome, sunny good looks are well used. ""The Next Three Days"" reminded me of Hitchcock, and of 1993's ""The Fugitive,"" but it doesn't rise to that level of classic. Rather, it's a well-oiled machine, designed efficiently to crank out the audience's engagement, tension and release.

There are a couple of especially good moments. The opening scene could have been satisfactory if all it did was to set the stage for what is to follow, but it does so much more. I'd love to watch that scene again (and again). A women with a plunging neckline spars with Lara, a more modestly dressed woman, about whether or not women can ever get over their competition over men and bond with each other. The scene demonstrates its contents: Ms. Dcolletage uses double entendres to make a pass at Lara's husband, and Lara shows the audience she is quite capable of losing her temper, an important plot point. The brilliant writing in this scene is a bonus. There is a scene involving a sewer drain that economically resolves a question the audience has had for some time. A scene with a car door is similarly powerful and informative. Brian Dennehy's performance as an intimacy-impaired, working class dad is almost wordless and quite brilliant. And the film really does bring poignancy to the scum of the earth, drug dealers.",1290297600,101,1819,4.7746031746031745
4136181,5,B003L20IG0,"Russell Crowe plays a man who's wife is convicted of a murder he's convinced she didn't commit. After she tries to kill herself, he decides to break her out of jail. Although the movie felt somewhat slow for a portion of it, ultimately I have to say that I enjoyed it, and can highly recommend it. Here's why:

1. It's a smart movie. It makes you think, and you're not told every last detail up front. In fact, you don't even know if the wife was innocent of murder or not for most of the movie. You're led through the story with pieces to the puzzle, and by the end it all comes together. It was really interesting.

2. It was not predictable. I found myself constantly evaluating what was happening, and trying to figure out what would come next. When you think you know what's coming, you realize you don't. It had some interesting turns and twists.

Although it started out slow, I think the way it progressed was important for the development of the characters and the story. It was, in my opinion, a good decision to develop the story this way, and worth sitting through.

3. It challenges your values. I had to keep wondering if I thought Crowe's character was doing right or not, and I found I kept evaluating whether I wanted him to succeed. Was he a desperate man who was forced to become a hero? Or was he a man who has gone over the edge into darkness? It certainly makes you think.

4. The acting was amazing, as you'd expect from Crowe. We think he's one of the very best actors of our time. Elizabeth Banks played the wife, and she was so believable. I was surprised that Liam Neeson had such a very tiny role, and Brian Dennehy, a powerful actor, barely said anything. Still, their presence in the film added to it.

5. There was some good action. Not a ton of it though, but enough to keep your adrenaline rushing once in a while. The last portion was edge of your seat exciting.

Ultimately I'd say this is a very satisfying movie experience. It's different, not a formula, and by the end you're on the edge of your seat.",1290211200,381,2039,4.35

4136317,4,B003L20IG0,"Russell Crowe plays ""John Brennan,"" whose wife, ""Lara"" (Elizabeth Banks), gets arrested for murder, but with so much evidence against her, only John believes she's innocent.  But is she?  After 3 years at a temporary holding facility in urban Pittsburgh (and their young son growing up barely knowing his mama), she's then given a notice that she'll be moved to a full-scale prison in only 3 days, hence the film's title.  As an upstanding teacher in the city, John hardly has the mind of a fugitive, but a seemingly shut-and-close case against his wife forces him to become a fast-learner, if he's going to successfully break his wife out, no matter the sacrifices.  Former Best Actor Oscar winner Crowe (""Gladiator), using a convincing Yankee accent while initially showing a softer/family man side, proves without a doubt that he's a Hollywood heavyweight, with Banks also holding her own (even without makeup in most scenes).  Moreover, there's Liam Neeson, Daniel Stern, Jonathan Tucker, and Kevin Corrigan in cameos, along with Jason Beghe (TV's ""Chicago PD""), Brian Dennehy, and Olivia Wilde (who sure reminds me of Banks).  My only mini-complaints are it being maybe 15-20 mins too long and an odd choice of background vocal music.

4136502,3,B003L20IG0,"3 1/2 stars:  Paul Haggis based this movie on the 2008 French movie ""Pour Elle"" (""Anything for Her""), and (he tells us in a ""special feature"" accompanying the DVD) he extended it by about 30 minutes to make the story ""deeper and darker.""  He is, of course, also making an escape-chase movie, and while retrospectively one can see why the scenes he added might be considered to add depth and darkness, in the experience of watching the movie itself, the thrills of the escape and the chase pretty much overwhelm any ""deeper"" interest.  In order to be convinced of ""depth and darkness,"" we would have to see a lot more than we do of Russell Crowe's character prior to his taking desperate measures (to get his wife out of jail) in order to savor that darkening and deepening contrast.  But, if you're not worried about that -- or haven't heard Haggis and others talk about it -- you can just sit back and enjoy the story of how an ""ordinary man"" plans to get his wife out of jail, where she is serving a life sentence for murder.

Obviously, it takes ingenuity and a fair amount of cool -- and there's a nice scene early on in which Liam Neeson, playing a seven-time escapee, schools John Brennan, Crowe's character, on what to look out for and gives him a time frame in which to accomplish all this in Pittsburgh, post-9/11.  So there's an element of ""caper"" in the planning, although we don't see as much of the detail in that planning as we do in, say, ""Ocean's Eleven.""  Still, we see enough, and we enjoy the surprises that come along as a result of not having too much of the plan revealed to us.  I don't want to spoil the surprises and the suspense, so suffice it to say that Brennan's plan is complicated by his needs to get money to get false documents for his wife, child, and himself, and by his desire to keep his family together during the escape.  Where's he going to get the money?  Well -- without giving too much away -- drug dealers come into it, and he lucks out too in having his child be a guest at a birthday party at Pittsburgh Zoo when the main action is going down.  The most testing moment comes when it seems that perhaps, after having freed his wife, he isn't going to be able to get to his child . . . .

Elizabeth Banks, who was so appealing in ""Love and Money,"" is John's wife, Lara.  Brian Dennehy has a pretty much non-verbal role (but an important one) as his dad.  Neeson's part is a cameo, but a memorable one, and Olivia Wilde plays the mother of the little girl whose birthday party takes place at the zoo.  With her trademark low-burn intensity, she suggests that John -- unshaven and unprepossessing for most of the movie -- is nonetheless capable of awakening some sexual interest.  Lennie James and Daniel Stern play the main Pittsburgh cop characters, and they are just close enough to Keystone Cops in places to give a touch of humor to the chase.  Finally, though, there's a sentimentality at the film's heart -- for a movie trying to be ""dark,"" it maybe isn't dark enough.  John, a desperate man, still won't do anything that compromises our rooting for him.  The people who are seriously hurt are bad people.  But let's face it -- it's a chase movie, and plausibility is out the window!",1463961600,,3232,4.427364864864865

Crowe does well here and most involved also the same. It's quite manipulative but it's also dramatic in a good way that keeps you in the seat.

4137053,4,B003L20IG0,"Russell Crowe's performance is the best thing about this movie; his intensity brings plausibility to his character's increasingly far-fetched actions. He's trying to save his family, after all, even at the risk of losing his soul. I liked the middle part of the film the best, where he dips his toe into a world of criminality he knows nothing about, learning how to break into a car through a YouTube video, for example. The pace gradually picks up, reaching a well-paced crescendo of action and suspense. Maybe the most interesting thing about the movie is that the viewer is made to feel less certain than Crowe's character about the innocence of his wife. You almost want to blurt out loud, ""Are you sure about this?""",1407888000,,721,4.776

I saw DIAL M FOR MURDER last night for the first time.  It had twists and turns and was delightful to watch.  This movie was the same way, just with a modern feel.  A lot of people say Russell Crowe is not so nice in person.  I have no idea and never judge except by my own experience.  But he plays the good guy in movies to a T.

Here, he tries to save his wife from prison life when all options for getting her out legally are beyond any hope.  He hatches a complicated plan that sometimes falls apart but he keeps reinventing it while all along the way taking care of his six year old  son and keeping him isolated from the goings on.  The story gets more and more intense as he gets closer to getting his wife out but you need to pick it up from here and see for yourself.  I don't want to spoil it.

However, it started building to ""The Next Three Days"" and became clearer at that time.  Once things really started rolling, I found myself wanting to yell at the characters.  Nobody was acting the way I wanted them to.  There were times I thought about washing my hands of them and just shutting the movie off . . . but, I held on.  And I'm glad I did.  There was a twist at the end that made all my frustration worthwhile.  Since then, I've gone over various scenes in my head and, with distance and after seeing the ending, more of the confusing part made sense.

4137194,4,B003L20IG0,"The reviews for this one were pretty bad and were probably due to the director and cast.  Ebert (one of the best) said as much when he basically declared this a good movie but said he was left expecting more.  In other words, if it wasn't this writer/director and these actors involved and instead a bunch of no name or first time folks, this thriller would have probably gotten pretty good reviews.

People who review movies for a living shouldn't have this bias coming into watching a film but of course they do.  The ones who let them dictate whether they give the movie a positive or negative review are making a mistake.

A movie either works or it doesn't.  Scenes either work or they don't.  And although there were some things in this movie that were hard to believe (mostly for me, the fact that Crowe's character didn't himself move heaven and earth to find that button before even considering a jail break--this character would have found that button!), exceptional things do happen in this world of ours and odds are overcome, so in the end, I was able to buy most of what Haggis was selling (unlike the vast majority of reviewers out there) and enjoyed his movie quite a bit.",1383696000,,1188,4.549295774647887

I don't want to spoil the ending, but basically the movie starts out with a weird little dinner party, and the next day the police bust down the front door and arrest a man's wife for murder. They try the appeals process, and she reveals some more information, and he decides to break her out of prison. The couple has a son, which makes the movie even more poignant.

You will want to watch this movie at least once - they don't show the women's actual trial, but it does make you wonder how many innocent people get sent to prison based on circumstantial evidence or the lack of a good defense attorney.",1382054400,2,695,4.346153846153846

4137215,3,B003L20IG0,"Overall I guess I liked this movie.  Here are some things I liked about it(may not want to read if you haven't seen the film):  the last 30 minutes or so are very suspenseful (although somewhat unbelievable, but in a way that I could live with).  The acting is good.  I liked how the grandpa found out what was going on yet remained loyal to his son.  I thought he was doing it to make up for their lack of relationship, kind of a way of showing his love for his son. I loved the scene with Liam Neeson--very intriguing character that you see for too short of a time. I also liked the scenes where the Russell Crowe character realizes the gravity of what he is doing--when he thinks about robbing the bank, when he fails in the key situation. Here are a few things I didn't like: I almost quit the movie after one of the very first scenes--the argument between the two women in the restaurant.  I thought it was very unrealistic for two women to talk to one another like that, particularly in a public place. The scene was so over the top I was afraid to trust the screenwriter and director with the rest of the movie. Also,I had a hard time liking the wife/mother/unfairly convicted prisoner woman. But by far my biggest complaint was my sense that the writer seemed to be implying that it was alright for our average joe/former solid citizen to rob and and cause the deaths of certain people because, after all, they were only drug dealers and anyway, he had a higher purpose that was worth more than their lives. That attitude left me with a lessened appreciation for the ending of the story.",1375660800,,1595,4.389830508474576

Elizabeth Banks is amazing in everything, she's such a diverse actor, but Crowe I find somewhat static in a lot films. This one made me a fan of his, though. The intense planning of the prison break was impressive, his performance was believable - I enjoyed watching him as the struggling and devoted father and husband.

The film was quite long and in parts it felt long - but the ending was worth it. The film really took me on a journey and I believed in the cause and the characters.

4137270,4,B003L20IG0,"John and Laura Brennan (Russell Crowe; Elizabeth Banks) and their son Luke (Toby and Tyler Green) are enjoying a family meal together when suddenly their home is broken into and armed police take the couple into custody. It seems that Laura is wanted for the murder of her boss. I found this opening quite unbelievable - or at least I hope it would be. To have a bunch of storm-troopers breaking into a private home where there is a young child, without any warning that anything was amiss, without any social services official to take care of the boy, and arresting both parents while only the wife apparently was wanted for questioning seemed to me to be incredible. Were there no other suspects for the crime? Except that Laura had an argument with her boss, and her fingerprints were on the murder weapon, were there any other grounds to suspect her and was there any other explanation? Were Laura's fingerprints already on file?

Once I got over my initial incredulity, the acting of all concerned was good and the story was nail-bitingly tense. Laura, who is diabetic, gets convicted of the murder though we have no details of the evidence. Because John feels his life falling apart when he fails to get Laura released, he decides to try to break Laura out of jail and for this he enlists advice from a previous felon, Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson). Brian Dennehy has only a minor role as one of the grandparents looking after Luke while John breaks innumerable laws himself to get Laura released. I also doubted if a humble schoolteacher which John was would have the guile and resources to implement such a breakout. But if you can live with the highly improbable story-line, the film itself - a remake in English of a French film, Pour Elle - is very exciting.",1371427200,,1770,4.673076923076923

4137302,5,B003L20IG0,"Yesterday, my late-night bargain-bin movie was ""The Next Three Days"" starring Russell Crowe. It was a quite good movie that had a very unusual structure. The story started out very slow and relaxed until Crowe's wife was arrested and jailed for a murder. From that time on, the movie progressively accelerated. Toward the end, the pace was just frantic. Then it all very abruptly ended leaving all sorts of unanswered questions. Strange structure. I suppose a lot of people might have found the ending less than satisfactory, but I'll bet they'll be talking about it long afterwards.

Crowe played a middle-aged community college professor with Elizabeth Banks playing his wife. They shared a small boy plus the grandparents in their extended household. All seemed like an ordinary happy family until the wife was abruptly arrested and jailed for murder. Crowe thought his wife to be totally innocent, because he knew her, as he put it, but the available evidence seemed to point the other way. Later in the movie, she even admitted her guilt. In any case, Crowe had devised an elaborate scheme to break his wife out of jail, whisk her away and get re-establised in a South American country. It seemed a rather improbably scheme, I might add, and the whole thing was under a tight time deadline. I'd say it was the time pressure that really got things tense as the movie progressed, coupled, of course, with a tight police pursuit. Toward the end the movie became one long chase scene and then with an end that seemed as if someone had slammed the door in your face. Rather well done, I might add.

It's a well constructed movie. The acting, direction and filming are all first rate. To me, the story seemed highly improbably, but I gradually yielded and went along with it. Very entertaining movie!

I wondered about his comment saying it ""challenged our values"" and thought it didn't challenge mine; rather it was me viewing him from the outside with my own value set.  But the fact that I had to admit I didn't know how to think about him, made me realize that was exactly what I was doing.  Well worth the watch; I'll guarantee you've never seen anything like this come out of American film making.  I loved every bit about it, however disconcerting.

Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

So i really like the parts where he has to get fake passports and gets robbed, goes on the internet to learn how to open a locked car with a tennis ball and contacts an ex-con who actually escaped from prison, because honestly thats how 85-90% of us would have probably done the same thing! Its funny to think about but its true because the average person wouldnt know how to do any of those things.

4137407,3,B003L20IG0,"The Next Three Days is Paul Haggis', director of the 2006 Best Picture, Crash, latest film. I'm not the plot summarizing type, but I'll give it a shot. It stars Russell Crowe as John Brennan, a perfect husband that finds himself lost in life once his wife, Laura (played by Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of her boss, who she had a nasty argument with earlier in the very same day. Once she is arrested, which is early in the film, John goes through expected depression, and eventually arrives at the surprising conclusion to break her out. He then goes through the tedious (but you wouldn't tell from how swiftly the story moves along) process of planning, and preparation.

The Next Three Days is an entertaining film. Not as complex as one might expect from a prison break movie, but if you're one who can suspend your disbelief, and just enjoy it for what it is, you should find a fun ride in this. Let's be honest, most movies are first and foremost: ENTERTAINMENT. Every detail does not need to be laid out. I respect a director who has enough confidence in his audience's intellect, that he leaves out some things to allow the pace to flow.

Haggis does just that. Minor details like using a tennis ball to pick a car lock in a millisecond, or detectives that seem to be smarter and work a lot quicker than your average cop, are what force you to have to suspend you disbelief in order to really get into it. The suspense is quite thrilling. I had to remind myself that I wasn't a freaking Film Critic a couple of times, so that I could allow myself to have fun. But, all in all, I think the suspenseful and dramatic scenes hit the right emotions at the right times.

They never really came off as bogus or cheesy to me. There are even a bunch of funny moments sprinkled throughout. It's like Bourne for married people. The shaky cam, quick outfit changes, dramatic movie kills and all make their appearance here. And all for the good. The script is tight.

The musical score is good as well. I love that it was filmed on location in Pittsburgh and a later destination that will remain unidentified. What brings it down to me are the moments I mentioned above, when you're forced to suspend disbelief in order to accept some unrealistic things. That's such a huge deal in these kinds of movies, because the point is to make us feel like that could be us. Despite its flaws, I recommend it. Like I said, it's Bourne with older married people. If you like Bourne, which you should, or you suck, then you'll find something special in The Next Three Days.",1341792000,,2571,4.475479744136461
4137428,3,B003L20IG0,"The Next Three Days eschews the conventional thriller storyline to show a desperate man taking desperate measures.  Anti-hero Russell Crowe - now looking podgy for some reason (ala State of Play) - actually looks a little unhinged or deranged in this film while taking on the mission of a lifetime.  He's convincing in many ways, but the film might have worked better without a celebrity.  Having Russell in the driver's seat detracted from the suspense.  Maybe he's too familiar to us.  (Interesting that Amazon lists Liam Neeson's films alongside this - both Taken and Unknown are riveting - and Liam makes a cameo here, almost blowing away Russell Crowe IMHO).

To the film's credit, we never quite know where it's heading - will he make it?  Will they make it?  Won't they?  So The Next Three Days avoids the pitfalls of cliche in many ways.  Definitely watchable.  Just didn't press all the buttons for me.",1340841600,,911,4.812903225806451

This is a film made for Russell Crowe because he has the massive intensity required for the role of an ordinary guy who must throw himself into extraordinary and extremely dangerous situations in order to rescue his wife and save his family. This is a really clever thriller and like all good thrillers, it is unbelievably tense. Partly this is due to the really intense performance given by the great Russell Crowe but the plot is so cleverly devised and executed that this intensity is further amplified to produce a taut gem of a film where no shot is wasted. Liam Neeson's performance, though small, is pivotal to the plot and gives us an indication of where both the plot and Crowe's character are going. I don't want to say too much about the plot because I don't want to spoil it for you but this is an A- grade movie destined to be celebrated by all those who take the time to see it. The film is exceptionally written and beautifully directed by Paul haggis and there are some other beautiful performances by Brian Dennehy, who says a lot with just a look, Elizabeth Banks who gives a carefully calibrated performance of someone under great stress, and Lenny James whose character adds to the tension immeasurably. This film is based upon a French film called POUR ELLE (For Her) which is worth seeing in its own right but this American remake is also a superb film.

4137436,5,B003L20IG0,"The Next Three Days is a movie full of suspense. It really kept me on the edge of my seat and that doesn't happen very often.
Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant as John Brennan the main character. The rest of the cast is also well chosen and their acting is great. The different characters are nicely developed, convincing and plausible. The dialogs are well written.
There are many touching scenes where no words are spoken. It's just the acting and some background music which tell you more than any words could say. The soundtrack is also very well chosen. Layout and scenery of Pittsburgh play an essential part in the story line.
The plot is very densely packed and fast-moving and consists of many small scenes. Some of the deleted scenes would have filled some gaps and provided the viewer with some helpful explanations. It's a pity that there is no extended version on the DVD. There are for example deleted scenes that would have explained how John Brennan came up with the plan to tamper with his wife's blood test to get her out of prison.
The Next Three Days is definitely one of the best movies I have seen lately but nothing is perfect. You just can't push up the door knob of a car with a tennis ball. There would have been some other means like a device to intercept the door lock mechanism with remote control. John could have obtained such a device from the same shady neighborhood he got the passports from. I also didn't like the scene of Lara trying to throw herself out of the car just because John made a sudden change in plans. Why a second suicide attempt now when she is almost home free? A freaked out Lara pushing at her husband while driving could have just as easily caused the near accident.
Anyway, I think the whole story is quite believable even though there are some very convenient coincidences. Just watch Reality TV and you will see even more unbelievable stories.",1334534400,3,1906,4.576023391812866

But sometimes I'll rent a thriller I've never heard of simply to get my mind off of things. Sometimes I just want to watch a popcorn movie instead of a film, instead of a piece of high art.

Well, I'll tell you something... I swear to you... This film LITERALLY MADE MY HEART BEAT FAST for the last fifteen minutes. And the equally cinematically educated woman with me sat on my couch motionless for the final ten minutes with her hand over her mouth, with tears welled up in her eyes.

It's easy to fall into hyperbole and say this and that is the greatest so and so... because we want to share our exuberance when we make a great find these days, with Hollywood grinding out so... much... insulting garbage... but even so...

I'm going to choose my words carefully. This film is a masterpiece. Superb, moderated performances... clever and twisting script... brilliant editing and sound... and in terms of the direction, well...

4137466,5,B003L20IG0,"The Next Three Days flew somewhat under the 2010 holiday movie season radar however it is a film that should not be overlooked. An expertly blended drama and thriller it centers on a man coping with his wife having been arrested and convicted for a murder she did not commit. When it becomes evident that she will not be getting out through the legal system he sets out on a plan to break her out and evade capture.

Director Paul Haggis (Crash) has crafted a film that feels real and remains grounded. In doing so the tension at times is ramped up to remarkable levels. The main reason for this is how the audience is taking that same emotional ride with the main character from start to end.

The first half of the movie is very much a drama. John Brennan (Russell Crowe) is faced with hanging on to faint hope that his wife Laura (Elizabeth Banks) will be freed through the appeals process while raising their young son who is struggling with having lost his mother. As that hope disappears he begins planning to break her out.

The important thing here to me was that Brennan is no expert on pulling something of this nature off. He doesn't have a genius mind and he certainly doesn't have any inside knowledge beyond some general advice he receives on the matter. It becomes a methodical process over a lengthy period of time with some trial and error involved.

Then the second half takes an intense turn and becomes a thriller as the character becomes increasingly desperate and reaches the point of no return. That contrast and character development really sells the film completely. The reason why the tension was so high was because the audience had become completely invested in the outcome which remained in doubt until the very end.

At just about 130 minutes I was surprised just how much had been packed in without ever feeling rushed. Haggis was able to pace it beautifully, allowing for that methodical-like buildup that would eventually result in enhancing the intensity of later scenes.
This is one of the few movies in recent memory where I can say that it really put me on the edge of my seat. I literally felt my heart racing at times. The uncertainty of what was going to happen was incredibly refreshing.

The performances from Crowe and Banks are excellent as they exhibited the subtlety of their emotions even when trying to shield that from each other. In the case of Crowe it was primarily that desperation bubbling up and with Banks it was having to try and accept the inevitability of her situation.

There are several smaller roles and cameos from terrific actors. Liam Neeson, Brian Dennehy, and Lenny James are a few of the most prominent ones. Olivia Wilde felt a little underutilized however and that would be one of my very few issues with the film.

The Next Three Days may very well be the best movie of 2010. A drama at heart it takes the audience on a roller coaster of emotions and thrills making the eventual outcome for the characters truly meaningful.",1325548800,,2995,4.637735849056604

Several primary complaints about the movie.

- It was overly long and poorly paced.
- There was insufficient exposition and background story to account for Crowe's descent into the underworld.
- What leads us to believe Elizabeth Banks' character is even remotely willing to murder someone?  Where was the real motive?
- Are we to assume the professor-turned-ninja over night due to testosterone overload?  His wife's charming and magnetic hold over him?
- Crowe is equal parts somber and plaintive, yet accomplishes the feat of not portraying a shred of depth in his character.

4137483,5,B003L20IG0,"""The Next Three Days"" has wonderful acting, gritty, realistic settings (Pittsburgh), amazing pacing, and most of all terrific directing.

Paul Haggis, director of ""Crash,"" directs it, and he does a stunning job.

Russell Crowe is fabulous as the shocked, stumbling husband whose wife is abruptly arrested for murder.  You can see him change as the movie progresses, from an inward, cerebral teacher, to an impulsive, confident, try-anything action-man.  He does what teachers do best: he learns from his many mistakes.

Elizabeth Banks is equally terrific.  She goes from being a flip, feisty housewife and working woman to being a downtrodden, hopeless, loveless, suicidal lifer.  She is so rattled by her arrest and imprisonment that she even confesses.  You never know till the end whether she did it--or even what she did.

The pacing is superb.  There is a relentless, ticking force to every move each character makes.  You don't know whether it will lead to death or freedom or some horrible compromise.

The police are equally good.  Slowly figuring things out, then never letting up to preempt then catch the fugitives.

Even Liam Neeson, whom I always thought overrated, is great.  (It helps that he has such a brief part.)

And Brian Dennehy's silence is so convincing that until the very end, I thought he was mute from a stroke.

All the tiny details, from buttons to quarters, fit--but you don't know how till the end.

When he realizes that she may not survive the life in prison, he decides to break his beloved wife out of jail.

Based on a 2008 French thriller ""Pour elle,"" ""The Next Three Days"" is a class tale of an average person placed in an unusual situation. The Hitchcock-style character-driven thriller is not about car chases or shootouts. It is about making decisions alone. And those decisions must be right. Luck may help, but what is really vital is will.

Director is Paul Haggis, whose works include ""Million Dollar Baby"" as screenwriter and ""Crash"" as co-writer/director. For the American version he changed several parts of the original film. The changes are done by adding materials. So the running time is longer. Not all additions are necessary, I think. The episode about the missing button seems pointless, as the film is after all about John, not Lara.

The story itself may not sound very convincing to some, but with strong performances not just from the leads but from the capable supporting actors like Brian Dennehy and Daniel Stern, ""The Next Three Days"" is an enjoyable thriller.",1316995200,2,1591,4.903345724907063

Absolutists who think implausible causes should be discounted will lack my enthusiasm for this film. In 'The Next Three Days', many small causes win over one big cause. In the world of philosophy, the term is 'a causal chain', one event leads to another and others up to the final effect. Most movies talk one cause for end effect. Quick, neat, familiar.

Writer/Director Haggis goes a more complex route, which makes this engrossing, well-acted and written/directed by Haggis film both unusually challenging and satisfying. The price of admission: Thinking is required. But not enough to damped your appreciation for the film. Haggis wrote other recent tricky flicks:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000MNP2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and both wrote and directed<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;Neither are cut-and-dried, both quite complex with ambiguous characters/plots.
Just like real life.

The advantage of this approach: his films can be seen again and again while still providing their initial impact. Maybe just describe this film is 'equivocal' as well as entertaining. I've seen it twice, end to end; maybe even liked it better the second time through.

Nit-pick: the Last-minute proof of guilty or not is rather too-fortuitous and pat and hurriedly presented in a 'What? Did the police consider this initially?' Haggis's faultless direction falters a bit here, logically and in presentation. But really, guilty or not doesn't drive this fine movie. More than any film I've seen recently, this has a character-driven plot. All characters contribute to the mystery one way or another.

Another point of logic is why Crowe's character puts such into devising his wife's escape meanwhile
staunchly believing in her innocence (maybe a too-frequent device for such guilty/not-guilty causes?)
Yes, another nit pick; but not enough to delete a star from such a fine flick.",1316908800,2,2282,6.144200626959248

Second query: Facial recognition at the airport. Please, for fifteen minutes at least the persecution began. And if the suspicion was founded, sending their faces should never wait that long.

Third query: The alleged murderer did not leave a DNA sample on the extinguisher as  murder weapon?

Fourth query: After three years the police officer decides to find out if the button argument is valid and goes to the already contaminated the crime scene after so long to check if there is a button yet? In case he had found it, I had thought that the agent was family Mc Giver, be for sure.

To my surprise, Russell Crowe's latest film, The Next Three Days (2010), was a better than expected action/suspense ""heist/caper"" film. The trailer, and many critical reviews I've read, don't do it justice. But writer/director Paul Haggis came through here in my opinion with a gripping drama that starts slow, but builds the stakes to a good climax. It definitely reminded me of the now classic Harrison Ford vehicle, The Fugitive (1993). But it was a fresh twist on an old concept. It even has a bit of Enemy of the State (1998) and director Tony Scott's iconic style mixed in for good measure.

The concept of The Next Three Days is pretty simple. It's a story about a family of three who are living the idyllic modern suburban lifestyle. Elizabeth Banks plays the mother, and seemingly the breadwinner, in the family. One morning, their calm house is stormed by the police and Banks' character is arrested and charged with murder of her female boss at work. The story pretty much jumps forward three years to where Banks is locked up in jail for life after being found guilty in court. Her husband, played by Russell Crowe, doesn't believe she's guilty for a minute, but they could never find evidence of her innocence or the actual killer to take the blame for the crime. Banks' character can't seem to deal with the loss of her life and attempts suicide, adding to the pressure that Crowe and their son already feel from their fractured family. So Crowe decides he has to break Banks out of jail. And he finds out exactly what thats going to take from ex-convict Liam Neeson. The rest of the plot goes where you are probably guessing it goes. So I'll let the film fill in the rest.

I will say that some of the ""extraordinary"" (or coincidental) circumstances and events within the story make one suspend belief in order to really enjoy the film. Usually these kind of unrealistic and overly ""lucky"" sequence of events take me out of a film to a degree. But somehow, Haggis and Crowe and the rest of the cast and filmmakers pulled it off with this one. I can see how some film critics and viewers of the film might not let the far fetched conceits of the film work for them. But as I've written before, movies by definition are creating a ""fantastical"" world in which they exist. Every sci-fi or alien movie requires one to suspend belief to some degree. And just because The Next Three Days doesn't live in one of those genres, doesn't mean that it can't ask you to suspend your sense of realism. Enough said!

There's no doubt in my mind that one of the key aspects of the success of The Next Three Days is Russell Crowe's performance. He plays a middle-aged, slightly overweight, married father quite well. And yet he also transforms during the course of the movie into a badass criminal. All at the same time he remains a caring father and loving husband. And I think it's that process of personal transformation with his character that makes the film interesting. The first hour of the film is a little too slow in that process maybe, but it does really build-up to the engaging third act of the movie. I think maybe the writing and editing could have been a little tighter to keep the movie moving along more. But after listening to an Apple ""Meet The Filmmaker"" podcast with director Paul Haggis defending his purposely slow build-up in the first half of the film, I can also buy into that philosophy. But I think if the film did have a little faster pace to it, it would elevate the film to higher level at least in my eyes. Nonetheless, this is a successful film and it works.

The production values in The Next Three Days are really solid like so many films today. The cinematography from Stphane Fontaine is good, but nothing I haven't seen before. The production design by Laurence Bennett is also well done and gives us very realistic sets and locations for the story to take place in. Sound Editing led by Renee Tondelli is really well executed with a full array of surround sounds we all expect now in an action film of this type. And I was very impressed with Danny Elfman's music. He continues to shine and gives this film a better score than one like this typically gets. And I do think that is part of what helps elevate The Next Three Days above its peers like Unstoppable (2010).

I missed seeing The Next Three Days in the theater last year, but it was a nice surprise seeing it in HD recently. I continue to be amazed at how much better many movies look at home on blu-ray or in HD than they do in the theater. The theaters really need to invest in modern digital projection technology and bring back the aura of the cineplex. While I can't make the direct comparison here, my intuition tells me that I didn't miss anything in this film's theatrical presentation. And I couldn't have asked for a better home theater presentation. The high definition mastering of this film is about as good as it gets.

The plot and sequence of events, while certainly not realistic, is believable enough for you to buy into it and gain a sense of gravity for the characters and their actions.  I haven't seen the original, but I'd like to if I can find it on Netflix or as a cheap purchase somewhere.

Furthermore the plot develops far too slowly, with little to no action other than the last few minutes. The chemistry between Crowe and Banks is so shallow that you feel nothing for them.

Russell Crowe's wife is convicted for the murder of her boss. Two possible scenarios of circumstantial-evidence are presented; one shows innocence; the other guilt. The government presumes the wife is guilty; and so, does not investigate the innocent scenario for evidence. The only circumstantial-evidence presented points to guilt. Even husband, Russell Crowe, has some unspoken doubt. We find out for certain in the end; but you will have to wait.

Russell Crowe's wife has lost all legal-appeals. Russell seeks the advice of an ex-con, who successfully escaped from prison; about how Russell can do the same for his wife. You really feel this honest man, Russell Crowe, having to go criminal to try to spring his beloved wife from prison.

It is not the depressing film the summary suggests, because you are on Russell Crowe's side from the outset, though sharing his uncertainty, and the film moves fast and clever. Russell does some preparations about which we are curious; we see why later when his plan is played out.

Things do not go smoothly for Russell Crowe; some trial & error, and some quick-thinking make this movie realistic.

Recently, our government has unionized in self-serving, unconstitutional, conflict-of-interest. Thus, in civil-cases today; some Judges blindly accept the facts of fellow, government-agency-employees and government-lawyers, and so, also, fail to investigate the facts or require proof; leading to corrupt and evil rulings. This film shows the stress of the good citizen having to fight a corrupt, incompetent, evil, government by unlawful means. This is a feel-good film for the private-sector, down-trodden.

The acting is stellar; there is significant character development and there's suspense, mystery, action and many poignant moments. The film also benefits from solid cinematography; and the musical score is very well done. True, that the beginning starts off a little slow; but I think it sets the stage for character development and in that case it's worth it. The plot also has numerous unexpected plot twists and turns as others have noted; just when you think something is about to happen something else might happen instead! That's a fine quality about this film.

When the action starts, we meet John and Lara Brennan (Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks) who are having dinner with John's brother Mick and sister-in-law Erit (Michael Buie and Moran Atias). We also see just how happy and gratified John and Lara are with their lives: they are very much in love with one another and they adore their beautiful three year old son, Luke (Tyler Green). Suddenly one morning, however, the police and many detectives barge in and arrest Lara for the murder of her boss; Lara is convicted of this murder even though she says she didn't do it. But they have the evidence: people at work saw Lara fighting many times with her boss; Lara's fingerprints are at the scene of the crime; and her boss's blood stain is on her coat.

Three years pass as John faithfully makes his trips to the prison, sometimes with their now six year old son Luke (who is now played by Ty Simpkins). John is greatly pained at Lara's emotional deterioration; she tries to kill herself after all legal appeals have failed and she even angrily tells John that she did commit the murder! John, however, doesn't believe Lara did it, not even for a moment.

John realizes that he can't be without Lara: she is being transferred to another correctional facility far away and her mental health is only getting worse and worse. In a frenzy John makes a three day plan to get Lara out of prison at any price he is going to free Lara but he doesn't tell her for fear that she might try to stop him.

Have to admit that I never heard about it before, so I watched it totally unbiased and THEN got curious and checked out the message board on the imdb.com and the reviews here in amazon.com.

I have watched many boring movies in my life which got great reviews and had some of the best actors and promising plots, but to me they simply didn't deliver. For some reason this movie seems to be very controversial (I was amazed that there are 9 (!) pages of board messages on the imdb.com...usually there is not more than one page with 7 or 8 topics per film) and lots of people don't like it and claim it's just another average Hollywood production. Well, it's not. It's more than that.

First of all it has everything for me that I expect from a great thriller: it's totally unpredictable (good plot with many twists and turns and basically no plot holes), has a great cast, an interesting location, a good soundtrack and it kept me on the edge of my seat from the first minute on. While watching the movie, I got carried away to the point that I forgot it's just a movie (usually I can tell myself while watching movies that this is just a movie). I cannot give any film a bigger compliment than that!
For me it doesn't get any better than this!

We watch on an average 5 to 6 movies per week (mostly on weekends, we are both movie buffs), moreover we also go to the movie theaters a lot, but when I try to remember the last good thriller that I've seen, it must have has been 2 or 3 years ago.

The Next Three Days does beg the question: What lengths will we go to in life to change the course of circumstances, whether those circumstances are fair or unfair?

The scene that sticks out in my memory is the discussion that John Brennan is having with his classmates on Don Quixote. He questions:
""What if we choose to exist purely in a reality of our own making?""

This reference to Don Quixote pretty much parallels Brennan's irrational thinking in attempts to create freedom for him and his wife, in which he takes extreme measures, even acting criminal, to secure this idea. This includes speaking to former ex-cons about escape plans, dealing with drug traffickers, and thinking like a criminal. He transforms from professor to criminal, and rationalizes every wrong act with a flawed scope of truth and reality. To secure his family's freedom is an unfaltering goal.

Still, after viewing,  felt a bit off by the plot's absurdity, which seems to have us believe in the unlikeliest of occurrences and that, when faced with a criminal on the loose, law enforcement will find a way to bumble things up in amazing ways. Sometimes we watch a film with full disclosure that it is trying to be fantastical and unreal, and can accept that, but other times, absurd logic may get in the way of an otherwise solid film.

But he did an amazing job in this movie.  A lot of movies promise a suspenseful ride, but many of these same movies disappoint.  This one did not.

The plot line is fairly straight forward.  Russell Crow plays John Brennan.  His wife, Lara, has been convicted of murdering her boss.  He is convinced she is innocent.  After exhausting the appeals process, they realize that she will be in prison for the rest of her life, and their son will have to grow up without a mother.  John cannot accept this and begins to make plans for her escape.  Much of the running time is build up to the actual escape, but it's done very well.  You see the lengths John goes to in planning the escape.  He is forced to make some very difficult decisions, and take some risks to procure the necessary items and most importantly, the money to pull off his plan.  Russell Crowe gives an excellent performance throughout this movie.  He comes off as a down to earth regular Joe, trying to pull off a very daring, very dangerous escape.  He makes some mistakes, but he refuses to give up.  Through it all it is apparent how much he loves his wife and son.

Elizabeth Banks, the actress playing John's wife, Lara, does an amazing job as well.  You can see how devastated she is by being separated from her son.  She breaks down when she learns that the last appeal has failed, and it's a very touching scene.

The movie really picks up steam during the escape.  There are several cops that are on the trail almost from the very beginning.  These cops seem to be anticipating their every move, and the suspense is amplified as the movie continually leaves you guessing as to whether or not the family will get away.  As for the ending, I'm not giving anything away.  You'll have to watch for yourself to find out.

Maybe a second veiwing would help him to understand it better.  I've watched it three times already, and enjoyed it each time.  It's got plenty of action, but not more than necessary.  I would like to rate it four and a half, and would've given it five stars if the ending had a more solid resolution.  It works the way it was done, but I was left with a feeling of wanting a hint that all would be well, and that they were going to make it...as exiles, and as a family.  Maybe a final scene of the entire family (father, mother, child, both sets of grandparents) getting together and looking happy and loving. Too much?  Maybe just an embrace between Crowe and his wife instead of her avoiding contact...just something to show they would be happy and think that it had all been worth the effort and sacrifice.

All in all, I recommend this highly.  It grabs your interest at the beginning and doesn't let go until the end.",1305158400,,1084,4.424242424242424

4137573,4,B003L20IG0,"How far will a man go to prove the innocence of his wife, incarcerated for murder? To the end of the world--if Russel Crowe's story is to be believed. A sudden turn of events leaves his happy little family in a shambles. Crowe's wife (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of a woman, with whom she had had a spat in a restaurant sometime before the incident. The tell-tale ""evidences"" make it an open and shut case, and she gets life sentence with most of her appeals turned down hurriedly.

As she gets bitter and even suicidal in her confinement, Crowe, convinced of her innocence, decides to take law into his own hands. With the prejudice of society, even of close relatives, getting more pronounced by the day, the hapless husband scripts a meticulous plan to bring his wife back to freedom: by jailbreak. This escape attempt, in the face of a high security prison system and a super efficient city police department, is quite riveting, and stands to atone some parts which drag on a bit.

Another aspect I liked about the movie is the wisdom in not revealing the truth about the crime. This really does not matter to the story. It is the husband's conviction in his wife's innocence that counts. That is the reality Crowe, like Don Quixote, has chosen to exist in, that is for him better than a life in despair. As reminded by the wife in a piece of conversation, he belonged to the reality another world. This insight into a different kind of psychology, when juxtaposed with the hard boiled action scenes--of murders, chases, police operations, acts as a balance and lends its special beauty to the movie.

Now back to the dragging parts of the movie. Sometimes things get tedious because many different genres seem to coalesce in the narrative. It is simultaneously a jailbreak action thriller, a study of psychology, a family drama, a whodunit and so on. Many of the details such as the underworld part, the escaping guide by an expert, could have been curtailed to give the movie a taut unfolding.",1304467200,2,2015,4.670422535211268
4137574,2,B003L20IG0,"***WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS, DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER- THAT OR SKIP TO THE NEXT REVIEW***

I didn't know this was a remake of a French movie until I slapped the money down on the counter and the clerk asked me if I'd had seen the French version. That's when an alarm went off in my head and my inner curmudgeon asked ""Where is the originality these days???"" And after watching this over-long and convoluted bore, I can't imagine the French movie being any better.

On a positive note, this movie has a good cast- Russell Crowe, Elisabeth Banks, Liam Neeson and a few others. However, all but Neeson are horribly wooden in this film. It's unfortunate that Neeson only makes a cameo because his 5 minute performance had more emotion in it than anyone in the 130 minute duration of the movie. Russell Crowe goes about sounding like he is reading his lines off a sheet of paper, and Banks keeps the same monotone voice through the ENTIRE movie.

I still am unsure of the movie's plot after seeing this disaster. Basically Crowe's wife is accused of murder, and the police arrest her as soon as she discovers the splattered blood on her jacket (seriously she didn't notice until just days after it happened?!?!?!?!). After battling the justice system for 3 years with no luck, she is sentenced to serve a life prison sentence in three days. Crowe, unable to find anything else to do, decides to bust her out of jail... and then the rest of the movie doesn't make much more sense.

Well, I'm all for a wrongfully accused movie- one that makes you think, one that has the viewer on the edge of their seat, but this movie is so implausable I can't even begin to describe. My biggest problem being the movie's ending- it turns out she didn't do the crime, someone just bumped into her with blood on her, but we get what sounds like a clear confession in the middle during this exchange:

Banks: ""You never even asked me if I did it!""
Crowe: ""Because I knew you were innocent!""
Banks: ""Well then you would have been wrong!""

This somehow left me feeling at the end ""What...?"".

Maybe it's that I'm getting older- I'm not a teenager anymore so therefore it's becoming easier to pick a movie apart- I understand what suspension of disbelief is, and I know what implausability is- the latter is what his movie flirts with. And plain and simple, if a movie is not believable in the least bit, I can't get into it. Let's also not forget them trying to get into Canada. A Canuck myself, Canadian officials are NOT as stupid as shown in the movie!!! Having been in almost every main airport, security would be able to detect a photoshopping job in a (fake) passport. Toronto and Montreal are especially hard on these.

I wish I could recommend this movie but it is all too implausable and confusing. I haven't seen the French movie but I already don't plan to. Ah well, at least this wasn't 3D.",1304380800,4,2922,4.510396975425331
4137575,4,B003L20IG0,"For a lot of this movie, I was wondering if it was worth sitting through the rather slow buildup. A lot of it seemed to drag on and on. I guess it was meant to be that way as Crowes character slowly plotted things out. This is certainly not a movie for teens as they would not last through the first reel before heading for the door screaming in boredom. Yet, patience Grasshopper. There is a reward at the end. That end was a nice payoff and if not for that, I might have been pretty mad.

It was well acted out and Crowe played the character well. The way he fooled the cops at the end was especially nice.

What I found rather perplexing though was the billing of Olivia Wilde. She is in the movie all right, but her part is rather minor for how her name is so prominently shown in the credits. I really like her as an actress, but her screen time is rather minor. I would say Brian Dennehy had more screen time yet he got barely a mention compared to her. I guess it's her hotness that did it. On the other hand, she really rocked in Tron, but I digress.

Russel Crowe is the real star in this movie. Even his wife is a minor character compared to him. The whole movie centers around him and what he does. A man desperate to save his family. It brings up the question of what would any man do to save their own when they know deep down their loved one is innocent. And, in the end scenes, there are a few clues to whether she is or isn't.

As I said, the payoff is at the end and makes the slow buildup worth it. Four stars because the buildup was a bit too long. Still highly recommended.",1304294400,,1593,4.063694267515924

Russel Crow was AMAZING in this movie. He looked great, totally believable as a loving hubby and father. The writing was great. I will say the first scene and the second (in the car) were not what I would call PG-13 material only because I found it uncomfortable as I watched this with my 14 year old son.  But, I'm a prude when it comes to my own boys ;)

This was an adventure, it really kept you wondering what would happen. That was the entire point of the movie...what is going to happen??!! Will they get away with it???  I sat on the edge of my seat the entire time, like the first time I watched Speed, waiting, worrying, wondering!!!!

Then came the ending. What a bummer. I almost forgot it was a movie..I wanted to flip the 'book' over and see if I had missed the last page.  The ending was not...bad...it was just unclear. I am pretty sure I get what the 'outcome' was, but this movie reminded me of my soap opera.

Under Paul Haggis' assured direction, Russell Crowe leads a great cast.  Crowe evokes lots of empathy as the devoted husband/father who goes over the line to free his possibly innocent wife from a life sentence.  Is he legally right?  Is he morally right?  It's a tough question to answer---the crux of Haggis' script.  Elizabeth Banks gives strong support as the convicted wife, but it's the smaller roles that put the icing on the cake:  Brian Dennehy's stoic father; Jason Beghe as the impassioned cop; Jonathan Tucker and Kevin Corrigan as the doomed meth manufacturers and Olivia Wilde, the pretty mother who befriends Crowe.  Add some thrilling action sets and Danny Elfman's elegant score and you have an under-appreciated film--much better than Haggis' Oscar-winning CRASH.",1302825600,,908,5.352112676056338

4137610,5,B003L20IG0,"The Next Three Days is easily one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. The acting is stellar; there is significant character development and there's suspense, mystery, action and many poignant moments. The film also benefits from solid choreography and cinematography; and the musical score is very well done.  True, some may say that the beginning starts off a little slow; but I think it sets the stage for character development and in that case it's worth it. The plot also has numerous unexpected plot twists and turns as others have noted; just when you think something is about to happen something else might happen instead! That's a fine quality about this film.

When the action (and there's quite a bit of action at that) starts, we meet John and Lara Brennan (Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks) who are having dinner with John's brother Mick and sister-in-law Erit (Michael Buie and Moran Atias). We also see just how happy and gratified John and Lara are with their lives: they are very much in love with one another and they adore their beautiful three year old son, Luke (Tyler Green). Suddenly one morning, however, the police and many detectives barge in and arrest Lara for the murder of her boss; Lara is convicted of this murder even though she says she didn't do it. But they have the evidence: people at work saw Lara fighting many times with her boss; Lara's fingerprints are at the scene of the crime; and her boss's blood stain is on her coat.

Three years pass as John faithfully makes his trips to the prison, sometimes with their now six year old son Luke (who is now played by Ty Simpkins). John is greatly pained at Lara's emotional deterioration; she tries to kill herself after all legal appeals have failed and she even angrily tells John that she did commit the murder! John, however, doesn't believe Lara did it, not even for a moment.

John realizes that he can't be without Lara: she is being transferred to another correctional facility far away and her mental health is only getting worse and worse. In a  frenzy John makes a three day plan to get Lara out of prison at any price--he is going to free Lara but he doesn't tell her for fear that she might try to stop him.

Of course, there is much more for you to enjoy watching this film. Did Lara really kill her boss or is that confession to John a symptom of her mental illness? How will John get Lara out; and who will help him make his plans--if anyone? Watch and find out! In addition, look for excellent but all too brief cameos by Liam Neeson as Damon Pennington, a man who escaped from prison seven times and even wrote a tell-all book about it; Olivia Wilde as Nicole, a mother of one of Ty's friends; Brian Dennehy as John's father George and Aisha Hinds does a great job of playing Detective Collero. RZA also has a cameo playing ""Mouss.""

I understand that there was at least one Q&A session with the cast and crew after this movie was released; I would have loved to see this as an extra on the DVD but it is not found here.

In short, The Next Three Days is jam-packed with suspense, mystery, pathos and action. I highly recommend this film for any fan of the actors in it; and anyone who enjoys this genre of film will love this motion picture.",1301702400,5,3253,4.501694915254237
4137611,4,B003L20IG0,"In the unusual thriller ""The Next Three Days"" we follow a community college professor John Brennan(Russell Crowe)who is trying to break his innocent wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) out of the county jail before she is transferred to a maximum security prison. It appears from all the evidence that Lara who had a fight with her boss before going out to dinner with her husband, killed her boss.

Based on the French film ""Pour Elle"" (titled ""Anything for Her"" in the United States), the script has the pacing and structure of what one would expect from a French thriller which compliments the material. By the conclusion however it shifts into an American thriller in overdrive. That's not necessarily a bad thing but the script is awkwardly structured at times with underdeveloped characters. Made for a surprisingly low budget (about $35 million), the film has a distinctive European thriller feel until the last 30 minutes where it becomes a more conventional American style thriller. I don't believe trimming it down to 90 minutes as some critics have suggested would have helped the film since the film would lose so many elements of the subplots as to make it more conventional and almost incoherent.

SPOILERS:

The film is unusual in that it focuses mostly on the efforts of Crowe's character in learning (from a former prisoner who has written a book about escapes played by Liam Neeson in a marvelous cameo)the nuts and bolts of how to escape, obtaining the money to escape, passports, etc. and his frustration has he comes up against both dead ends and potential leads that could help him without exposing his plan. We learn very little about whether or not Lara did it until much later in the movie. What's also unique about the film is that his character never tells his wife what he is planning for fear that she'll say no or that her knowledge might make her look suspicious and alter her behavior in jail.

The film written and directed by Paul Haggis is far from perfect though as the subplot involving Detective Quinn (Jason Beghe a marvelous character actor who bring as much depth as he can to an underdeveloped character)the man that arrested Lara and his suspicions that John is up to something involving his wife are not very well developed and seem almost like an after thought. Likewise when Detective Collero (the marvelous and under used Aisha Hinds)is called in on a robbery of a meth house that seems to point to John the subplot again seems clumsy and doesn't fit with the carefully constructed story.

END OF SPOILERS:

The last half hour of the film rolls along at a breathtaking pace but, again, there are some details that are unbelievable and unless you totally buy into the film and are swept away by the plot you may not buy it.

What sells the film are the performances by Crowe, Banks, Beghe, Hinds (introduced late in the film)in performances much better than the script itself. The terrific Brian Dennehy is wasted in a small role as John's father.

The DVD looks quite nice although the dark, moody lighting suggests that this would probably look better with sharper detail on Blu-ray.",1301270400,,3123,4.79182156133829

4137615,4,B003L20IG0,"To say that I wanted `The Next Three Days' to be better isn't meant in any way shape or form to diminish it's quality or your preconceived idea of it.  The film is a tightly woven thriller that engages our `suspension of disbelief' without abusing it, remaining for the most part intelligently thought out and compulsively watchable.  Still, I can't help but notice aspects of this film that could have been better.  As with nearly every film made (very few, if any, are perfect), there is usually something that could have been tweaked for a better result, and so one may wonder why bother addressing them all.  It could prove to be tiresome.  The reason I mention this with this particular film is that, with the themes presented here this film could have been OUTSTANDING.  By failing to completely flesh out certain aspects of the film it remains `a good film', but the potential for utter greatness is glaring back at you with beady eyes.

Alas, this film is quite good indeed.

The film's focus is John Brennan, a good looking middle aged schoolteacher married to a beautiful young woman who has bore him a sweet young son.  John's world is flipped on its head when his wife is accused of murdering her boss and sentenced to life in prison.  When the years trickle by without any real hope of her being exonerated, John either has to accept the harsh reality that his homelife will never be back to normal, or he'll have to take matters into his own hands.

While I'm not as `head over heals' for this film as the sites reviewer Bret Fetzer is (to call the supporting cast `outstanding' feels like a total stretch) I must admit that he covers some sound points in his review.  The film is exciting and compelling from start to finish, and it is aided vastly by Crowe's remarkable acting chops.  He digs deep, even deeper than the films script initially allows him to.  He is always adding layers to the character, even when he isn't speaking.  You can feel that this is no longer Russell Crowe but that he is, without doubt, John Brennan.

The film's plot has a few holes, especially with the scenes that show John testing out his plans in broad daylight in front of passersby's and never being caught (well there is the one `scare' that goes by under-punished).  Like I said, the film asks you to suspend disbelief, but it also makes sure to lather John's action with enough sound judgment and caution to cause you to believe he can pull this off.

But, for me, the film should have slowed things down a tad.  This definitely shows my personal preference when it comes to my movie viewing, but I've always preferred a film that was more `character driven' as apposed to `action driven', and while `The Next Three Days' certainly has the emotional core present, it doesn't explore it as richly as it could have had it elongated it's running time and fleshed out the in-between; filling in those spots between all the planning and executing of this `escape'.  It flirts with this concept by introducing us to a single mother who takes a liking to John, but it shoots it down almost immediately, reducing her presence to a mere prop for John's plans.

Alas, the film, for what it sets out to be, is very good.  It is intriguing and exciting and moving.  I'd certainly watch it again, and I have no reservations in recommending this to any and all who are fans of the genre or the star.",1300924800,2,3389,4.5561056105610565

4137631,5,B003L20IG0,"Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is convicted of murdering her boss. Overwhelming evidence proves this. Her husband John (Russell Crowe) naturally assumes she is innocent of the dastardly deed. They go through the court system and run out of appeals; so that is that.

Well maybe not. No one realizes whom they are up against. John is a junior college instructor and knows a little bit about human nature. Soon he hones some new skills needed to extricate Lara. What looks like bumbling attempts may alert the authorities prematurely. However most of what looks like mistakes may be part of the big plan.

A small but crucial highpoint in the movie is John's father George (well played by Brian Dennehy) who knows about the plot but is closed mouthed.

Can John outwit the authorities and escape their containment skills? We get the thrill of being part of the chaser and the ""chasee"".",1300492800,,883,4.8344370860927155

4137634,3,B003L20IG0,"Decent on suspense, somewhat shaky on probability.
A woman gets mistaken for a killer (like good old Richard Kimble in the ancient TV series and later remake with Harrison Ford) and sentenced away for life (due to a combination of bad luck and bad police work). Unlike Kimble, she can't escape on her own, but needs her husband to get her out the illegal way, after all legal steps have failed. While with Kimble the main story was the near permanency of the flight, here it is the near endlessness of the preparation.

Her husband is a teacher, and a decent man. He is as far away from crime and violence as he could have been. He is so innocent that he blames himself for his little boy's problems at school, rather than putting it on the deplorable fact that the mother is a convicted killer. So for him to learn how to free his wife from prison is a major learning process. It is also a project that requires considerable financial resources, and as the housing market is not looking so good just now, and he can't sell his house, he needs to figure out how to come by money in a shorter way.
Escapism in its clearest double meaning.

P.S. I would have given 4 stars due to good entertainment value, but I can't quite get over the plot sloppiness of the blood spatter on the back of the innocent woman's jacket.

4137638,4,B003L20IG0,"Many have been wondering when Russell Crowe would make another film that lived up to his performance in 'A Beautiful Mind'.  THE NEXT THREE DAYS may not have the quality of script of that previous success, but in this taut film Crowe once again reveals how completely involved in a character he can become.  The film was written by Fred Cavay&eacute;, Guillaume Lemans, and writer/director Paul Haggis and the result is a story that while it may appear incredible to most, it is nonetheless an involving story of a man's love and commitment to his wife.

John Brennan (Russell Crowe) is a schoolteacher who has a happy home life with his beautiful wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) and son Luke (Ty Simpson). After a strange night out on the town the Brennan's return home to be met by policemen who arrest Lara for a murder she claims she did not commit. Jump three years and John has been working with lawyers, spending their paltry savings, on getting appeals to get Lara released from jail. He gets moral support from his parents (Helen Carey and Brian Dennehy) but sees his family falling apart. After three years have passed and when all legal portals fail, Lara attempts suicide and John decides the only way to get Lara out of prison is to aid in her escape.  He visits writer Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson) who has escaped from prison several times and outlines the dangers AND the only secure methods for affecting a prison escape.  John slowly and methodically prepares for the escape, gaining money by contacting drug lord Mouss (RZA), commits some crimes of his own as he masterminds his plan to successfully extract Lara from prison.  There are many twists and turns to the story, well written subplots and unexpected coincidences, all populated with a very strong cast of capable actors.

The real pleasure of watching this movie is to admire how totally committed Russell Crowe is to this role.  It is a very fine performance - one of his most subtle and best. THE NEXT THREE DAYS  is well worth watching.  Grady Harp, March 11",1300060800,2,2037,4.728813559322034

Yes, you have to buy the plot of a movie that a school teacher is going to get training & skills to break his wife out of jail, etc.

There are plot holes.  FILM MAKERS, I DID NOT NEED THE THROW UP SCENE.  Could have cut away.

Russell did a song in it.

4137643,1,B003L20IG0,"Positive:
(1.) Liam on a couple days notice.

Negatives:
(1.) How many times can the same story be told? Let's see.  We have someone trying to figure out how to bust someone else out of prison with the whole movie trying to sustain the impractical; the illogical; the improbable with, of course dumb cops, although portrayed as brilliantly insightful in being able to see and know what the audience is privy to (how convenient) yet somehow seem to bungle it all at the end.
(2.) Same old car chances and near misses.
(3.) Same old bystanders looking at the escapees with the audience wondering, ""Is this the time?""  But, conveniently -  near misses.
(4.) Same old Hollywood portrayal of a classroom with same old philosophical lectures which are also conveniently descriptive of our plot.
(5.) Acting was really robotic; they just didn't sell their roles as being realistic. Elisabeth Banks (of ""Slither"" fame) around whom the plot revolves is barely mentioned in the credits by Amazon and other sites.
(6.) Is it writers spending too much of their lives holed up in dark little rooms letting their drug induced imaginations run wild that is the source of such film tripe?",1299974400,6,1172,4.845
4137644,4,B003L20IG0,"At the risk of stating the obvious, at its core, this story is not about an escape.  So those expecting The Fugitive or Die Hard 19 will be disappointed.  To make this a proper Amazon movie review, I'll tell you the story, which you already know.  Man's wife is falsely accused and he springs her.  But the real story here is how far an ordinary person will go when pushed to the limit, or to flip the coin, what you might expect from somebody who feels they they no longer have much to lose.  These two items are handled rather nicely, including Russell Crowe's transition from school teacher to desperado.

The only false notes, assuming you can buy the story to begin with, are two strikingly beautiful women fighting over a pudgy community college teacher, another gorgeous young mom who really doesn't serve a purpose in the story, and Liam Neeson's odd and phony accent.  But these are more than offset by some great turns like slipping through Customs and of course, finding the garbage bag at the end.  Is the whole thing plausible?  Well...the escape probably isn't but sadly, the prospect of being falsely accused and convicted seemed absolutely believable to me.",1299974400,5,1173,4.738916256157635

The cops were terrible, the best part of the movie was Crowe in the drug dealers house, but then ruined. Having the dealer at gun point the man yells my baby and Crowe lets him run off, really stupid. The end seemed to drag on as well. Having really liked Crash I was dissapointed.

It's hard to go into too much detail about what the movie is about with out giving something away, but this is a very tense, edge of your seat thriller.  It starts off a little slow, but once John's plan is put into action it becomes a very fast paced action movie that you won't be able to stop watching.  Much like he did in ""Crash"" the director (Paul Haggis) is great at dragging out a 5 sec scenario that makes you second guess yourself three and four times before the result is shown.  That makes for a very fun film to watch.  This is an excellent action-thriller (that's saying alot since I'm not a Russel Crowe fan at all) that will not let you down.  Rent it! I give it an A-.

4137652,4,B003L20IG0,"""The Next Three Days"" combines an involved caper story with a solid action thriller.  One morning, Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of her boss.  She had argued with her the previous day and was seen by a co-worker at the scene of the crime.  Her fingerprints on the murder weapon and a blood stain on her raincoat add up to a strong case against her and she's found guilty and sent to prison.

Her husband, John (Russell Crowe), never doubts that Lara is innocent, but goes through the legal appeals process to no avail.
Desperate, John seeks out a man (Liam Neeson) who has written a book about his successful escape from prison.  After speaking with him, John comes to believe that the only way to free Lara is to arrange a prison break. The film engages the viewer as John methodically plans to spring Lara and subsequently disappear.

Director Paul Haggis has the problem of providing a lot of back story in limited screen time.  He succeeds by taking us quickly through the lenghthy appeals process and John's perseverance in a few brief scenes so the film can concentrate on John's planning the jail break.  Bonus extras include deleted and extended scenes, cast moments, a making-of short film, and the featurette ""True Escapes for Love.""",1299456000,2,1271,4.745454545454545

For anyone from the City of Three Rivers, it gets extra points for the location.  Russell Crowe does a great job as a loving husband and father who becomes a teachable student of prison breaks.  Along the way he must wrestle with moral and ethical dilemas.  He was instructed not to let anything stand in the way of his final goal but he does manage to keep some level of humanity even for a thug.  Looking for a source of needed cash, he picks the lesser of two evils.  His wife helps to check his final push for completion and remind him of the important things in life.  Desperation and love are great motivators.

Although brief, Liam Neeson adds his typical weight to the movie.  He gives Russell Crowe's character the needed 5 minute education he will use to carry out his plan.
Elizabeth Banks(wife) does a solid job as a woman ripped from her family and facing a life of confinement.  Fans of House will notice Olivia Wilde as the mother in the park.

Hats off to the director for tying up the loose ends and putting a bow on the  package.  The kiss and button were nice final touches.  I'm not sure how anyone can give this movie less than 4 stars.  It's a movie not a prison documentary.  Nothing in the film is beyond the realm of possibility.",1298764800,15,1502,4.3768115942028984
4137655,5,B003L20IG0,"This is my type of movie. Fast-paced suspense movie with a few twists.

Russell Crowe, who I really enjoyed in this, plays John, a devoted husband and father whose wife is convicted of murder. After losing appeal after appeal, he decides to take matters into his own hands to free her since he fears for her emotional well-being. He meets an ex-con who has written a book about breaking out of jail (Liam Neeson who I absolutely love!). Neeson gives him tips and the movie from here is excellent and kept me on the edge of my seat.

Some of the things John, a community college teacher, does are a bit unbelievable but if you can ignore that, you will enjoy this movie a lot. From learning how to make bump keys to committing criminal offences to get the money that he needs for a family of three to go on the run, you root for him all the way. I have never been a Russell Crowe fan but I found his acting was fantastic; you root for him even though you know he is committing morally reprehensible acts. Brian Dennehy who plays John's father is really good and Elizabeth Banks as John's wife Lara is quite believable.

Russell Crowe is a great actor and was neccesary to sell tickets but he is completely implausible for the title character. This story about a regular couple who go through hell, because the wife is falsely accused and convicted of murder is way too far fetched for this to be considered a quality movie.",1298160000,7,457,4.725
4137657,4,B003L20IG0,"Watching the trailers for this film, I was sure it would be a hit. Then, it came and went without much fuss, and I didn't catch it till it showed up in our $1.50 theater. To my pleasant surprise, it is a strong film, with a good plot and some great acting. Russell Crowe, Elizabeth Banks, and Olivia Wilde more than make up for Liam Neeson's laughably short cameo--laughable, since his name got a top billing.

""The Next Three Days"" revolves around the murder indictment of John Brennan's (Crowe's) wife, played by Banks. All evidence points to her guilt in the death of her female boss, and she gets put away in the county jail, set in the middle of Pittsburgh. The Steel City is a great setting for a film. Director Paul Haggis uses it nicely, making the numerous bridges a part of the film's plot when Brennan, a normally meek-mannered community-college teacher, decides to help get his wife out of prison. Meanwhile, his wife is not fully on-board with his plans, and his son is still grieving the absence of his mother.

In the theater, audience members gasped at a few of the surprises--one of which was psychologically believable, but still felt like a bait-and-switch tactic. The audience also gasped at one or two scenes that did not play out in the typical Americanized cinema fashion. Crowe's character is not the slick, former spy, superhero that we saw in Liam Neeson's ""Taken."" Instead, he uses his brain to make his plans, and when brawn comes into the picture he tends to bumble things. The audience seemed to want him to kick butt.

Personally, I was thankful for an intelligent thriller that built slowly around characters and plot, unfolded logically but in unique ways, and ended with some emotional satisfaction. But this satisfaction does not come in the typical cinematic last-minute wrap-up, in which everyone gets their due and the good guys lay all their emotions on the table for us understand. There are some understated moments that leave us somewhat unsettled, even as things are tied together. Like Haggis's other films, this is not a paint-by-numbers genre flick. I, for one, appreciated that.",1296259200,62,2125,4.816438356164384
