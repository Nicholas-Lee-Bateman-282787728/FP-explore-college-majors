4854939,4,B005OUL7OY,"I feel ""Flight of The Cardinals"" is a really good movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat at times, acting is criticised? I don't think it was that bad and David J Bonner gave a great performance, I would recommend the movie and DVD!",1326585600,,235,4.130434782608695
4854940,3,B005OUL7OY,"Failed, emotionally-depressed actor Grady (Ross Beschler) moves to the mountains of North Carolina to open a resort lodge, which isn't exactly welcomed by his neighbors.  He looks forward to visits from his friends, including former agent Karen (Claire Bowerman) and his long-distance boyfriend Andy (Michael Montgomery), and intends to ask Andy to move up there with him. A local young man, Beetle (David J. Bonner) is helping out at the resort temporarily, but his sweet, innocent Southern boy charm hides the reality of his bad intentions.

It's a suspenseful, well-acted and directed story, very different from the usual gay festival fare, though a bit simplistic and predictable for a film of this genre.  Unfortunately, there are technical issues (sound so low it can barely be heard at maximum volume, and a ""screener"" warning across the picture that appears about an hour in - even though I bought my copy at retail!) that significantly reduces the ability to enjoy the film.  Not reflected in the rating, but FYI: There is really no gay content, other than two gay characters.  DVD extras include only a photo gallery, a music video and trailer.  I give it three stars out of five.",1325548800,10,1190,4.984848484848484
4854941,4,B005OUL7OY,"This film is a very dark and twisting story, with a hidden evil character who is a perfectly nasty villain. The acting is strong ( with Matthew Montgomery in a supporting role, how could it not be ? ) and the script is smart. The actor who is the heavy did a very believable excellent job and the supporting cast was very good,  as was the lead actor. The set of the ( actual ) Appalachian resort lodge worked nicely as did the music. The slow uncovering of the hate-filled fundamentalism of one of the characters was handled effectively. Sometimes creepy to watch, it holds your interest.",1325462400,8,589,4.5046728971962615
4854942,4,B005OUL7OY,"This was an interesting story, with good acting and production values. There is intrigue and mystery, humor, and even a little sexiness, so something for everyone. Worth watching if you want a gay themed movie.",1325203200,3,210,5.0285714285714285
4854943,1,B005OUL7OY,"This movie is horrible from start to finish.  Poor acting, a terrible plot, dark scenes and poor audio.  Forget the widescreen it wouldn't have helped this amateur film.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I regret my purchase.",1324252800,4,229,4.973684210526316
4854944,4,B005OUL7OY,"AMAZON:  Once again someone was not paying attention in adding this movie to your inventory.

First you say ""Format:  Widescreen""

Then below you state ""Aspect:  1:33""

4854957,1,B005OUL7OY,"Overacted, predictable, poor script, many moments that make the movie unrealistic... Sometimes I feel like movies about gays are trying too hard, and this would be among those that try too hard.",1469232000,,194,5.09375

4854962,3,B005OUL7OY,"I would rate this a B+ movie. Plot is good, but could've been a bit better-developed. Acting is better than in some of Amazon's LGBT selections. The role of the young man creating the mischief does an especially good job with his role. Worth a watch.",1461110400,,250,4.456521739130435

4854970,1,B005OUL7OY,"Every time I start a gay movie and ""Waterbearer Films"" scrolls across the screen with their bad club music intro, I cringe.  Why are there SO many awful gay movies?  Aren't we supposed to be creative people?

Here's a review for this, and every other Waterbearer film ever made:

Shallow sound, stilted acting, contrived, aimless plot, film school quality production, direction and execution.",1457740800,7,392,5.174603174603175

4854973,4,B005OUL7OY,The acting was well done.  The story was interesting.  The ending was done to fast.  Almost like they ran out of money.,1447891200,,119,4.318181818181818

4854976,3,B005OUL7OY,"The acting was uneven, but then it had to be over the top in places for the plot to work. The Beetle character was the standout for me, , he was the most believable. There was little suspense until the end. The ending was too clichd for me, with the villain getting his due.",1444780800,,274,4.092592592592593
4854977,2,B005OUL7OY,wish I could get better guidance from my fellow amazon viewers would have saved me a hour of my life and steered me clear of this film was at best a decent college film project all due respect but the story was awful the acting was for the most part poor and just overall uninteresting,1444608000,2,285,4.2

4854982,1,B005OUL7OY,"Sorry.. I just cannot get past the mediocre-to-bad acting.  And the promise of a poorly conceived, poorly constructed story didn't help much either.",1439596800,,148,5.434782608695652
4854983,2,B005OUL7OY,"Starts out with bad acting and a somewhat intriguing slow-burn of a plot, then disintegrates into a complete mess...with bad acting.",1438819200,,132,5.333333333333333

4854986,4,B005OUL7OY,"This was set in a lovely place. It was suspenseful but the story needed more work.  It was entertaining and acted well by most of the actors.  It was good to see Matthew Montgomery in another film; however, his performance was not as great as it was in Redwoods, this was due in part to the weak story line I referred to earlier. A writer can truly enhance an actors performance if the story flows well and is believable.  It's a good movie and I won't put it at the bottom of my collection.  I will watch it again!",1390348800,,515,4.171717171717172
4854987,5,B005OUL7OY,absolutely adore Matthew Montgomery but david j. bonner absolutely stole the show of course ross bescher played a riveting role along with being an absolute spunk,1362873600,,162,5.269230769230769
4854988,5,B005OUL7OY,This movie is a must for all Matthew Montgomery fans even though he is not the lead character. It is not a gay romance movie but a thriller where the main character is gay.  This is a good movie but not great but I would buy this for your collection.,1357862400,,250,4.0
8482008,4,B005OUL7OY,"I couldn't do it.  The movie was a psychological thriller but poor Grady reminded me of  friend who should have been on meds and stopped.  I got about a r=third of the way through and had to stop.  However, it was very well acted and beautifully filmed.  So, if you can stomach it this is probably an awesome movie.  I am giving it 4 stars because i did not finish it w=but what I saw was really well done.",1526774400,,406,4.075949367088608
8482009,5,B005OUL7OY,Excellent!,1482192000,,10,10.0
8482010,4,B005OUL7OY,"This is a grade B movie all the way and while it is advertised as a gay film it is not really that.  Instead this is indeed a pretty engrossing psychological thriller.  We have a man with mental illness recuperating after a breakdown and starting to run a resort with the financial support of his close friends.  They are coming to visit with what he hopes will be a time for them to see how much better he is as well as for him to propose to his boyfriend.  Before this the local troubled kid who often does small chores for pay around the place worms his way in and has a plan of his own.  The suspense builds very well, the acting is fine and overall this film was very effective.  I found it an engrossing and enjoyable watch.",1480809600,,730,4.178571428571429
8482011,3,B005OUL7OY,Dialogue is a bit stilted but gradually the plot gets interesting and intense. Gay subtheme is almost irrelevant.,1478649600,,113,5.333333333333333
8482012,2,B005OUL7OY,"I was really hoping for more. It didn't build very quickly but then when it got there, it just fizzled and ended.",1475971200,,113,4.181818181818182

8482015,2,B005OUL7OY,It is a bit over the top as far as asking and musical score. The opening scene is idyllic but the music is too aggressive for the scene. A couple of the actors spend the entire family over acting while the story needs to be tightened up,1472774400,,236,4.042553191489362
