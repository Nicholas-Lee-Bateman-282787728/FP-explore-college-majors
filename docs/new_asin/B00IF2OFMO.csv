6262406,3,B00IF2OFMO,"i was enjoying the series until the last story.  i know it had been decided to end the show, but i felt the writer let we the fans down by taking the easy/lazy way out.  he created a strong female lead and then in one story, destroyed that.  instead it followed the typical male dominated world.  i had been looking forward to more series and was surprised to read this was the last.  the writer stated alot of people would be unhappy with the ending .. i can't believe such a smart, savvy silk could make the ridiculous mistakes that he created for her, she was way smarter than your last write and you took the easy way out.  shame on you mr. moffatt.  if you own series 1 and 2 you will want this to complete your library, but it was a downer.",1408320000,8,746,4.138888888888889

6262409,3,B00IF2OFMO,"Middle of season two was already losing the plot. The drive, energy and clever plotting was drifting off. And just got more  lost  until the dreary, unbelievable end.",1506988800,,166,4.892857142857143
6262410,5,B00IF2OFMO,"Sad there won't be a Season 4 as the cast of Silk is exceptional.  I've downloaded all the episodes as my wife and I plan to watch them again in a few years.  Six episodes for $17 was an easy expenditure.  I purchased each episode of Season 2 individually at $3/each, also a bargain for such exceptional drama, acting, and entertainment.",1505088000,,337,4.491803278688525

6262415,5,B00IF2OFMO,Love this show. Hate that it only has 3 seasons. Was not satisfied with the conclusion but it is a very good series with great characters and good acting.,1497312000,,154,4.344827586206897
6262416,3,B00IF2OFMO,I really like the series - but there are scenes missing from these episodes!! During the 'Previously on Silk... at the top of the episode there are elements that weren't in the previous episodes.  It's pretty frustrating.,1494806400,,221,4.972972972972973

6262418,1,B00IF2OFMO,What A Disappointment!!!!  I'd like to have seen a final (I've had enough of you between Maxine and Rupert characters).  Would liked to have seen her move on to another law firm and leave all the baggage behind.  I thought it would have been a much better ending.,1491609600,,263,4.4375
6262419,5,B00IF2OFMO,"Be careful when you read these reviews,  there are some spoilers in some.  If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons you will enjoy this.  Some of the characters are missing as the actors have moved on.  And I would say that the episodes deal more with the cases and less of the soap opera than seasons one and two.  But the undercurrent of the characters lives is still present and both the interpersonal and the case dramas are interesting and involving.",1491091200,,449,4.493827160493828

6262427,5,B00IF2OFMO,"Silk is a great series!  Season 3 continues on with the story of the English barristers & their relationships to each other and their clients.  This is one of my favorite English series, and although there's only 3 seasons, it's worth getting to know the characters and adding them to your list of great British TV!  Love it!!",1481932800,,326,4.586206896551724

6262436,5,B00IF2OFMO,This is the best legal drama I have ever seen. Everybody is flawed and there are some real villains but the main female character is engaging and compelling as she struggles for and against a moribund legal system and there is no melodrama.,1478044800,3,240,4.604651162790698

6262441,4,B00IF2OFMO,"Lots of loose ends and characters who disappear and sometimes reappear without explanation. On the whole, the series (Seasons 1-3) are well worth watching if you like well acted English drama.",1476748800,,192,5.225806451612903

6262446,5,B00IF2OFMO,"Maxine and Rupert were absolutely fabooo in this season! I honestly thought they were going to get together but by the 3d epi, Rupert stopped flirting and 'loving' Maxine ( :( ) and again resorted to his usual womanizing self. Despite the disappointment of a relationship between the 2 there was no lack of exciting and interesting twists throughout the season . . . nice to see 'Mickey Joy' back making trouble and Miranda was a great cast addition and she played her b*****y role perfectly. Her repartee has definitely expanded since she played the know-it-all in Vexed, good for her. The transition between epi's were consistent and kept me enthralled chomping at the bit for the next installment. Now I see why this season took ssssoooo long to come out :( Can't wait for another season!",1474848000,3,791,4.781021897810219

6262449,4,B00IF2OFMO,It was riveting at moments although some scenes did not seem legally possible. Be warned that it ends abruptly which was disappointing. I probably would not have bought it if I had known. Might have just found the conclusion online somewhere. Kinda of felt like the end of Whitechapel which was open-ended.  Ironically the same main male actor. :),1473552000,,347,4.88135593220339
6262450,1,B00IF2OFMO,Season three was so disappointing. The writers let these characters shortcomings rise and rule. These characters had much better angels and they deserved a much better ending to this series than this cynical mess.,1472256000,,213,5.294117647058823

6262457,5,B00IF2OFMO,"This series should be the standard courtroom dramas should aspire to. Cast, writing, casting, the entire package is GOLD. So disheartened to find out the series ended just as I discovered this Gold Mine. RPJ, Peake, Stukes, etc.what gems!!

I wonder if we can after the final shocker, and although I hated the head of chambers lady, a bit mustache twirling, acting in such an unethical way, it was a device to make us know what could be lost. So again, well done.",1521676800,,287,4.142857142857143

8641737,5,B00IF2OFMO,"If you like British dramas and legal shows, you will love Silk!  I just wish there had been more seasons.  However, you should probably brush up on the British legal system if you are unfamiliar.  Quite different from the US, but that just makes the show  more interesting!  BTW, you may want to turn on closed captioning to get around some of the heavier accents.",1509926400,,364,4.538461538461538
