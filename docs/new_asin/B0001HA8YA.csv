About the movie, well, it's like an anthology so some stories were better than others. But fun to watch the performance of young Michael Weston, Heather Matarazzo, Zach Braff and a great Bebe Neuwirth",1480291200,,263,4.866666666666666
8354437,5,B0001HA8YA,"i saw this movie a few years back before i even knew who zach braff was.  Braff and Matarazzo were excellent.  So was the other guy in it. If anyone know's who he is, please let me know... he was quite a dream-boat.  anyway, if you appreciate smart movies, see this one.  it's a sweet, smart comedy.",1095811200,3,299,4.192982456140351
