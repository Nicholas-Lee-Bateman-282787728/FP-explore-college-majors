I really want to get the other two volumes as well to complete the set. It was a really great buy for something used. also the supplier was very quick to send out my order I would purchase from them again. I am very happy with my DVD.,1396828800,,354,4.0
8232853,5,B000YI5RMY,This is a great DVD for people who wants to learn about Visual Kei.  I originally got this DVD because I was a big fan of Versailles.  But this thing was great from beginning to end.  Now I'm a big fan of Ayabie and Alice Nine.  Definitely should check this DVD out if your a fan of JRock.,1236643200,2,289,3.9310344827586206

8232855,5,B000YI5RMY,"I got this DVD just for the Alice Nine interview and clips, but I watched it and loooooved the whole thing. I got introduced to other bands that I either hadn't heard of before or just never gave a chance to. This is a great DVD. It even teaches you some of the history behind the visual kei movement.",1222473600,2,301,4.11864406779661
