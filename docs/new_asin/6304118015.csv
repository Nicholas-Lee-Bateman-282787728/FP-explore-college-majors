7862660,2,6304118015,"This is a short, silly movie. The reason for having this tape is the singing of Richard Tauber, not quite at his best performing in English, but, nevertheless, one of the greatest tenors of the century. His screen character is given an Italian name -- not credible for a moment because his voice and accent are obviously Germanic. But I don't care about that; I just want to see and hear him. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of this cassette chose to issue it in extended play format, at great cost to picture quality (reduced tape longevity can also be expected at this playback speed). It's difficult to understand why anyone would be so cheap. If they needed to save on tape, they should have excerpted the musical selections and cut out the rest of the movie, since Tauber's singing is the only worthwhile thing in it anyway. This cassette is worth just about what it costs -- under $5. (This review applies to the Madacy issue. I have not seen the Bel Canto Society tape.)",1028505600,7,977,4.620689655172414
