8158454,5,B000KP61EE,"This concert is exceptional in performance and location. Unfortunately not the whole concert is shown. It might have been possible to show the whole concert on the DVD, and a short selection on the CD. But I have much fun to view the video at home or to here to the CD when driven my car.",1360022400,,288,4.160714285714286
8158455,3,B000KP61EE,"My wife was very excited to receive the DVD/CD.. however, she was most disappointed in the fact that the DVD was very dated (recorded in 1996) and the quality of the music recording was less than ideal. If we had known how old it was, we would not have purchased it.. we love the music and we will keep trying.. thanks JWK",1359849600,,322,4.209677419354839
