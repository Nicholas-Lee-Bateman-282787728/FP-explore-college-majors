8458899,1,B000NDJQLI,This DVD is nothing more than a bunch of old guys out catching fish.  It has zero educational value on how or where to fish the CBBT for the different species.  It's a huge disappointment.  You're better off to buy a detailed chart of the area and extra fishing tackle.,1259625600,2,269,4.34
