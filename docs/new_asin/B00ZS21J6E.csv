7292013,4,B00ZS21J6E,"At the height of the Cold War CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) unites with KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) and British spy Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) on a common mission. It seems a former German scientist has found a simple way to enrich uranium and plans to deliver a bomb to a neo-Nazi group.

Solo is ""light fingered"" while Illya is a brute. The film brings this out with juxtaposition as we watch Solo seduce women and drink wine while Illya is engaged in a life and death fight. While our threesome work together, they distrust each other and have their own agenda in addition to their main mission.

In many ways this was like the new ""Fantastic Four"" where the intent of the film is to re-introduce the characters and officially name the group in the closing scene with the promise of a sequel. The dialogue was decent. The soundtrack at times was great and at other times loud and annoying. The film misuses radiation detection. The ability to detect radioactive changes in the blood is difficult, unless there is a significant, almost deadly amount of exposure...something one wouldn't get by using a non-reactor to enrich uranium.

7292015,1,B00ZS21J6E,"I wish that I could get my money back after watching it in the theater.  This movie has nothing to do with the Hit TV Series ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" other than the name of the movie and the names of some of the characters there is no connection between this movie and the original HIT TV series.  A truly awful and disappointing movie that was supposed to be based upon the original TV series, why else would you name it after the Hit TV show.  Everything about this movie was wrong, incorrect for the period, boring, or insulting.  The movie bashes Americans and guys in general.  When ever did Napoleon and Illya ever argue over womens' apparel accessories or man/woman relationships.  SERIOUSLY!  No cameo's by the original stars, no original TV theme music (which was awesome and far superior to what the movie had), no gadgets like the communicator pen and lots of others missing, and no UNCLE organization.  UNCLE was not aligned by countries nor did they represent any, but in this movie they do and in this movie Napoleon is a criminal and Illya is maladjusted.  Leave it to a British director to completely screw up an extremely popular classic hit American TV show that won Emmys and was the #1 rated TV show for 2 years.
The plot was non-existent, the pacing was as slow as a snail, and the dialog was painful to listen to.  I wish that Tom Cruise had taken this movie as he has handled Mission Impossible extremely well and produced a movie version that Boomers and everyone loves.  If you buy this movie you will regret it.  It is a total waste of money.",1439942400,10,1569,4.5053003533568905
7292016,4,B00ZS21J6E,"My Dad and I have both been massive fans of all sorts of spy movies and shows; specifically, the ones he grew up with from the 60s, such as James Bond, The Avengers, In Like Flint, and of course, The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  During its initial run, the original show had its share of television movies and reunion specials, but it wouldn't be until now that we got a proper movie adaption (and not just edited episodes run in theaters). So as much as both of us are fans of Guy Ritchie's work, we were still nervous about this new  take on one of our favorite shows.  Would this new movie be just like the old show and/or carry the spirit of it? Or would it prove to be a huge disservice?

I'm relieved to say it's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it didn't quite deliver what we were hoping for...but on the other hand, it was still a good movie in an of itself.

Set against the backdrop of the early 1960s period of the Cold War, the film centers on two secret agents. An American by the name of Napoleon Solo, and a Russian by the name of Illya Kuryakin. When a mysterious international criminal organization is bent on creating their own nuclear weapon, and thus, destabilizing the fragile balance of power between the nations, Solo and Kuryakin are forced to team up to stop them. With the help of the daughter of a vanished German scientist, it's up to the pair to put aside their differences and prevent a worldwide catastrophe.

Let's start with the good. While the plot itself is nothing phenomenal, it still has plenty of twists and turns that make it hard to guess what's going to happen next. And it would've been quick and easy to just set the movie in the modern day, so I give props to the director, writers, and so forth, for keeping the story and setting in the 60s (the same time as the original show). From the sets, to the costumes, to the cars, to the music, everything is as it was back in the day; keeping with the spirit of the old show.

What really wins in this movie, however, is the two actors they got to play Solo and Kuryakin. Henry Cavill is definitely channeling Robert Vaughn's performance as Solo; down to the voice and charismatic one liners. And Armie Hammer was surprisingly well cast as David McCallum's turtleneck-wearing Kuryakin. Together, the two have a great chemistry; constantly trying to one-up each other and prove their worth as the better spy. Ultimately, they learn to get along, especially when they find out they've been recruited to join the U.N.C.L.E. agency; a secret organization that doesn't work for any one nation--recruiting agents from all across the globe to protect the world from all who threaten it.

Which actually leads me into the one significant hang up I have with this movie. In the opening credits, there's a caption that says ""based on the television series, The Man from UNCLE""....and let's just say there's a heavy emphasis on the words, ""BASED ON.""  Other than the characters of Solo and Kuryakin, and the brief mention of U.N.C.L.E. at the end, the rest of the film is pretty much its own thing. To any fans of the old show who are expecting secret headquarters, the triangle badges, cool gadgets, and T.H.R.U.S.H. agents, you're going to be disappointed. There's virtually no mention of any of that stuff. Instead, they simply focus on the origin of how our two secret agents first met each other. And it's not that I have a problem with that (heck, I actually really liked that idea. To my knowledge, they never went into their back stories on the show proper). It's just that I was expecting more shades of the actual show than just the two main characters.  Perhaps the producers didn't want to just blatantly copy the old show, and while I can understand that line of thinking, then again, your mileage may vary on how wise of a decision that is.

However, for what it's worth, I've seen far worse remakes (I'm looking at you, Wild Wild West), and as it stands, this is definitely one of the better ones.  To the fans of the old show, if you're expecting this to be just like the TV series, you'll be disappointed. But if you just take it for what it is, and more or less treat it as just another spy movie, it's a pretty good one. The characters are great, the action is slick, and the 60s setting makes it all around fun to watch.  And who knows? If the movie does well enough, perhaps we'll get a sequel that contains even more of the old show we all came to see. It's not perfect, but it's a fun ride that I think would make the original MFU cast proud.",1439856000,102,4543,4.43937575030012
7292017,5,B00ZS21J6E,"This stellar cast really caught my eye! Here is a trio which easily delivers a tongue-in-cheek script for a PG-13 audience, most of whom have never seen the original TV show. All three actors are beautiful to look at; the script delivers nicely nuanced sexual tension; we enjoy witty repartee with nary an F-bomb; we gawk at wonderful locations; the Cold War is evoked with music, clothing, cars and spies. There is plenty of action which features gunfire, speed boats, motorcycles, a dune buggy, various trucks...and just a bit of highly satisfying blowie uppie stuff. Oh! And watch the stunt driving!

Directed and co-written (with six other collaborators) by Guy Ritchie (""Sherlock Holmes"") this reboot of the classic television series has us laughing from the first high-energy scene that opens the movie, to the final one which I won't describe.

Here is that eye-catching cast:
  * Henry Cavill (""Man of Steel"" and ""Immortals"") CIA agent Napoleon Solo is working for the CIA to avoid a prison sentence. He has to work with a Russian operative to find and confiscate an illegal nuclear bomb. This actor is British playing American.
  * Armie Hammer (""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Social Network"" where he plays twins!) KGB operative Illya Kuryakin has anger issues and trouble with impulse control. His job is to secure the bomb before that despised American. This actor is American playing Russian.
  * Alicia Vikander (""A Royal Affair"" and ""Anna Karenina"") Gaby Teller is supposed to intercept her German father who defected to the Americans after WWII, but may have helped a rogue organi- zation build that bomb. She is Swedish playing German in English.
  * Hugh Grant (""About a Boy"" and ""Bridget Jones"") Waverly seems to call the shots. Really?
  * Elizabeth Debicki (""The Great Gatsby"") Victoria Vinciguerra brings glamor to the Cold War. This Paris-born actress was raised in Australia and is playing ...maybe Italian?
  * Andrew Jack (""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"") is the brilliant dialect coach who worked with our stars and made them sound authentic.

As our screening audience exited the theater we agreed that this delightful outing should become a series. The four principals are perfectly cast, they play comedy with beautifully understated delivery, and it is a pleasure to spend time with them. Let's watch for them again; cross your fingers! (I'm waiting for Amazon to list this one so I can order my DVD.)",1439596800,17,2442,4.995061728395061

For some reason amazon thought it would be a good idea to zoom in way past the edges of the screen on a widescreen movie so it fills the entire iPhone screen which is 1 stupid and 2 ruins the fact that its a widescreen movie and it not supposed to crop out 20% of the picture cause amazon doesnt know how to do what Netflix already knows how to which is keep the aspect ratio of a movie when you double click to zoom so it only touches the left & right edges of the iPhone X screen. Amazon has had 6 months to correct this but apparently cant hire someone who can do this fix which is easy.

7292078,2,B00ZS21J6E,"Guy Ritchie is an overrated bore, which it pains me to state, since he is a Scot and I always want our people to do well, particularly abroad, where they function as ambassadors for our small country. In this disappointing film, chemistry between the principal actors is weak, while Ritchie's bizarre pacing only further isolates them from one another. And Gawd, but I do loathe that wretched old device where attraction between two players is continuously thwarted by inconvenient interruptions from maids and the like...; I don't want to completely spoil the wilful imbecility for you.

Two important points about this modern celebrity: first, Ritchie is part of William and Kate's inner circle of friends, which means that he will automatically receive a KBE, in time; second, the poor guy boldly included an apostrophe where none was needed in his opening credits, a common mistake in this profoundly illiterate age, though one which further signals that the barbarian hordes are upon us. (In her directorial debut, ""W.E."", Ritchie's ex-wife, Madonna, had King George III dying in 1936. Wow.) Also, during the early years of the Cold War, Land Rover Defenders didn't exist in a form depicted by the future Sir Guy. And finally, what's with all these clinically thin leading ladies?

There's something about the camera styles and humor he has in his movies that makes them enjoyable to watch and rewatch. I never heard of the television show from which this movie is based until after I watched the movie. I had 'rented' the movie via Netflix and after watching it just once I went on Amazon and bought it. Cavill's American swagger foils with Hammer's rigid persona and Ms. Vikander is as charming as she's ever been. For the lazy, it's a movie about spies. It goes much deeper than that and I feel that this is one of the better spy movies out there. I still like James Bond but I feel like there's a sequel somewhere out there for this movie.",1507593600,,721,4.388059701492537

7292140,4,B00ZS21J6E,"The story predates the TV series. At the end of the film they are recruited into U.N.C.L.E. but at the start of the film Solo and Kuryakin are working for the CIA and KGB. Until both agencies learn that a criminal organization is selling a nuclear device to fascists and decide upon a joint operation. Unknown to either side UNCLE is also involved under the direction of Waverly. At the end of the film Waverly is so impressed with their work that he decides to keep the team together under his command at UNCLE. It's really pretty good. The first scene takes place in Berlin during the Cold War. Solo has been given an assignment. He must get the daughter of a rocket scientist from East Berlin to West Berlin but he is encountering trouble from Kuryakin who's also determined to capture her. Solo finally succeeds and escapes with her to West Berlin. The next day while meeting his boss he encounters Kuryakin and his boss and both men are flabbergasted when they learn from them they must work together with the woman on this case. Naturally, there's an uneasy relationship between them. The next scene takes place in Rome. Both agents go undercover. Kuryakin becomes the daughter's husband and they go to meet her uncle Rudi at a party that the Countessa, their prime suspect, is throwing. Escapades reach a pitch at the party where all the characters in the film meet each other then continue into the night when both agents break into a factory and make their escape. When the Countessa is notified of the break-in at the factory,.her organization checks for both men at the hotel. When she finds them there all the arrangements made at the party continue the next day. Neither agent knows that Gaby, the daughter of the rocket scientist, will betray them to get to her father. Kuryakin escapes but Solo is captured. In the last part of the story the escape sequence begins with the slow death that the Countessa has planned for Solo at the hands of Uncle Rudi, a former Nazi who interrogated prisoners through torture. Solo is rescued by Kuryakin when they encounter Waverly who has taken control of the mission. Both bosses confirm it to their agents. Both agencies apparently ruined an UNCLE operation in Berlin that was waiting for the Countessa's gang to make contact with Gaby in Berlin rather than the CIA or KGB. Both agents were consequently loaned to Waverly's organization. They decide to destroy the information that both agencies want which apparently convinces Waverly that both men should be working for him at UNCLE.

Both play off each other very well  and set in  the sixties which  has so much to draw from to make a good spy film  .  I found this film refreshing and retro  and is edited in  some scenes in split screens and moves very smoothly. It also has a nice soundtrack .

Henry Cavill did a nice job representing the suave manner of Robert Vaugn's Napoleon Solo. Too bad his dialogue didn't keep pace.

The music bounced from classic sixties cool to bizarre techno-pop. Did little to enhance the film.

The positives all centered on the sixties fashion chic. Think Twiggy and Carnaby Street mod.

7292196,3,B00ZS21J6E,I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It is quirky and funny. But I just received this today and the case paper and plastic were all damaged. Hole in the movie title of the paper. Plastic scraped with holes. The case corner is cracked and broken. Piece missing. The edges on all four sides are scraped up. Just looks bad.  Almost as if it went through a machine or sorter that was too small or something. I am a movie collector. This does not look good. Not to mention it was new and it should look as such.,1488153600,,488,4.136842105263158

7292198,5,B00ZS21J6E,"I'm sorry this movie won't have a sequel. British director Guy Ritchie was definetily the best choice for this film. It would have banalized the characters to have had an American director. Biggest surprise is Hugh Grant as old Mr. Waverly. In the original TV series, Leo G. Carrol memorably played the role. All the characters in this movie need to be evolved more into some semblance of the originals. Much room for creativity there.",1487721600,,435,4.8133333333333335
7292199,5,B00ZS21J6E,"I watched this movie randomly without reading any reviews and liked it so much that I ended up buying it.  I love movies about covert operations and secret missions, and this one quenched my thirst for spy situations without bringing in the violence that plagues many other movies of the same genre.  It is lighthearted, funny, interesting, and relaxing to watch.  I was also very impressed with the soundtrack and listened to it frequently when studying for finals.",1487635200,,466,4.948717948717949

After I finished, I immediately watched it again, and simultaneously purchased the combo-set here!  Not only is the film refreshing in the espionage genre, but it's playful and has an AWESOME soundtrack.  Ritchie did a great job with the score, and it's one that I return to time and time again.  Cavill and Hammer are cast perfectly, and have great chemistry / competitiveness.  If you're hesitating - don't!  This movie is a lot of fun, without being too over-the-top or campy, while still telling a great story.",1486944000,,683,4.745762711864407

7292206,5,B00ZS21J6E,"As many before me have expressed in their review of this movie, I too was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this film. I never watched the tv series (as it was before I was born) so I have no prior history therefore I can't compare. I watched this film on a whim I think Henry Cavill is sexy but he hasn't done anything spectacular in his acting career screams pure talent (not that he's a bad actor). I thought he did an ok job as Superman, he wasn't the worse man of steel cough cough *Brandon  Routh* ..back to my review of this film. I liked him as Solo, his character along with Kuryakin made a good team. But the two who really stole the show we're Kuryakin and Gaby I loved them together! Armie Hammer played Kuryakin really well and Alicia Vikander added just the right amount of tough girl & vulnerable damsel that was not overwhelming. Overall the film had a great balance of action/comedy/romance. I literally watched it like 8 times lol.",1486857600,,955,4.426136363636363

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. [2015] has been revamped by director Guy Ritchie, who gives 007 a run for his money with his reboot of the 1960s TV show The Man From UNCLE, which as we know was the 1960s spy TV series that no one under 50 will remember and has a very sunny, funny tongue-in-cheek vibe to the film. An unusually restrained Guy Ritchie serves up solid entertainment with a classy touch, with a slight twist on the original TV series. Plus it is a lightweight but stylish high-kitsch fashion icon personified, to give the characters their very own charming and successful presentation.

Henry Cavill is very dapper and dashing as Napoleon Solo, dressed like Thunderball type era of Sean Connery in immaculate suits, and extravagantly polite, even at moments of the most extreme danger. Arnie Hammer is the gruffer styled machismo laconic Napoleon Solo's Russian sidekick, KGB agent, Illya Kuryakin. The two are first seen as fierce antagonists but are soon forced to work together in true harmony.

Its Cold War Europe setting is less about paying homage to its vague influences of Ian Fleming and John le Carr, and more of an excuse to embrace old-school city-hopping larks and sharply-suited 1960s adventure. Its all pulp and no politics as THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. film prefers to have a sly smile, where the new-school James Bond would grimace and to deliver a hearty backslap where John le Carr would shoot his doomed characters in the back.

Here we have a familiar story of spies, disloyalty, twists, double-crossing and a nuclear plot to destroy the globe, the film hops from Berlin to Rome, taking in other iconic scenic European spots along the way. Henry Cavills American spy and Armie Hammers Eastern Bloc stooge team up, with Alicia Vikander in tow as a fellow traveller and Jared Harris and Hugh Grant playing backroom puppet-masters. Its not quite teasing or knowing enough to be a spoof shtick, but its not far off. This is a film that is one step from winking at you mid-scene with great joy.

The film feels very British although one main character is American, albeit played by an English actor Hugh Grant, the other Russian, and the beautiful heroine Alicia Vikander is a car mechanic from East Berlin. Her father is a brilliant scientist who knows how to build atom bombs and her uncle Rudi is a die-hard Nazi. The British ambience is reinforced by the presence of Hugh Grant as the spy boss, saying ""well done chaps"" to Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin on the rare occasions when they follow orders. As the villainess, Elizabeth Debicki looks and behaves like a more sinister version of Lady Penelope in Thunderbirds.

All this charm is a little surprising considering that on paper its trio of leads, Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander, don't somehow gel together. But as it turns out, the two men have an especially sharp rapport, something Guy Ritchie previously conjured up between Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law in his Sherlock Holmes films franchise. You wonder if this is what Guy Ritchie is best at now: period action bromances set in cartoon-like worlds just enough removed from our own so that he doesnt have to bother with subtlety, meaning the mangling of accents, for instance, doesnt matter. Guy Ritchie sadly is still not great with women, must be his machismo outlook, but the saving grace is Alicia Vikander who has a great fun presence to bring some light relief. All the characters here are very much better spoken than those in the geezer-gangster films Guy Ritchie used to make at the start of his career. This is thankfully a Vinnie Jones-free zone and there is no hint of mockney here, thank goodness.

As the film enters a slightly hyped-up late phase in the game as the action really takes over. But THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. has enough style and smart persona to make it an amusingly louche summer film, which culminates with a mix of action and wit, suits and cities that feels refreshingly analogue in a digital world. The confidence of the final scene suggests theres more to come too, which is more than fine by me.

The setting may be the early 1960s but any ideological tension in the Cold War has been strained out. The differences between East and West are more to do with fashion, gadgetry and approaches to courtship than with politics. The tone of the film is relentlessly cheery, touching on the facetious, even though the plot involves deadly weapons that could blow up humanity. Sadly isn't a huge amount of chemistry between Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer as the ideologically opposed spies are forced to work together. The film's trump card is its carefree mixture of zest and stylishness. Despite a lot of critics gave it the thumbs down, I still enjoyed and high camp adventurer romp and as far as I am concerned Guy Ritchie can do no wrong in my eyes. Lets hope there will be a follow up film in the very near future.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video brings you THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. in a brilliant 1080p encoded image of great contrast and an equally impressive 2.40:1 aspect ratio. THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. was shot digitally on the Arri Alexa XT Plus and was shot via digital equipment, and the director Guy Ritchie wanting in making an obvious attempt here to make the movie look very much like an old spy film from the 1960s. With that in mind, the colours have been ever so slightly pulled back, and there's an effort not to use too many bright or flashy colours and viewers are treated to a lot of earth tones: greens, browns, tans, greys, with a splash of orange or red here and there. Details and depth here are pretty good. Black levels are strong and neither noise nor compression problems are an issue. Facial details, in particular, are well-defined throughout the film. Unfortunately, Cinematographer John Mathieson's obsession with lens flares, which to some people might become slightly a distraction in many scenes, but I think it adds to the style. Overall, this is a really stunning looking video transfer, which will be very pleasing to most Blu-ray film aficionados. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video brings you THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. in a totally awesome brilliant sound experience with an amazing 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround audio track that gives you and experience that is truly a heightened audio experience, especially when the films starts with the Titles and the singer Roberta Flack, that really gives all of your speakers a totally amazing good workout. Dialogue levels are perfect; each actor's vocal performances are as clear in two-person scene as they are in action sequences. This is a good thing, given how much of the film is dedicated to banter. Daniel Pemberton's film music score is also a totally awesome showstopper in the way it jumps between genres, evoking jazz, sixties-era tunes, traditional action movie score, choral movements, and one incredible thundering drum sequence. Sound effects themselves are nuanced, from the smallest light bulb to blazing gunshots. Surround sound activity is totally excellent, delivering precise effects placement that creates a 360-degree soundstage. Overall, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. delivers a totally solid sound mixes, and when this film kicks into gear; it offers some sublime demo material that will impress your guests. Sound effects effortlessly move from one speaker to another with a well-defined crisp sound. The subwoofers are heavy and deft during the action scenes, and the dialogue is precisely prioritized and clear. In addition, Lorne Balfes music film soundtrack is really clear and spans across all of your speakers and the audio mix is one to demonstrate via your surround sound system. Its one of the most immersive and impressive soundtrack ever put together I have heard in a long time.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Spy Vision: Recreating 60's Cool [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:34] With this feature it takes a look behind-the-scene look at how the film drew its inspiration from the look and feel of 1960's spy films. It is one reason why THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is so much fun is that it takes place in the 60s in Europe, which means lots of amazing fashions, locations and vehicles. This gives us a look at the costumes, the places in Italy where the movie was shot, and the cars and technology used. Contributors include Lionel Wigram [Producer/Screenwriter], Guy Ritchie [Director/Producer/Screenwriter], Armie Hammer [Illya Kuryakin], Elizabeth Debicki [Victoria Vinciguerra], Joanna Johnston [Costume Designer], Hugh Grant [Alexander Waverly], Alicia Vikander [Gaby], Sue Quinn [Supervising Location Manager], Alex King [Action Vehicle Coordinator] and Sylvester Groth [Uncle Rudi].

Special Feature: A Higher Class of Hero [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:13] With this feature it takes a look on how the filmmakers tried to make the action sequences in the film look realistic, yet still innovative and original and just in case you wondered how many of these effects and stunts were practical, this special feature provides you with an answer: pretty much all of them. You also get a nice surprise to see they actually drove a vehicle across a lake by hydroplaning on the waters surface. Contributors include Lionel Wigram [Producer/Screenwriter], Paul Jennings [2nd Unit Director/Stunt Coordinator], Guy Ritchie [Director/Producer/Screenwriter], Dominic Tuohy [Special Effects Supervisor], Alicia Vikander [Gaby], Armie Hammer [Illya Kuryakin], Henry Cavill [Napoleon Solo], Luca Calvani [Alexander Vinciguerra], Alex King [Action Vehicle Coordinator].

Special Feature: Mtisse Motorcycles: Proper  And Very British [2015] 1080p] [1.78:1] [5:00] Here we take a look at the Mtisse motorcycle which Armie Hammer's character zoomed around in during an action sequence in the third act of the film. Armie Hammer takes us through a tour of the Mtisse Motorcycle factory, which is attached to the owners home and is based Carswell near Faringdon, Oxfordshire, England. Armie Hammer seems to have a very big soft spot for these Mtisse Motorcycles. Contributors include Armie Hammer [Illya Kuryakin], Gerry Lisi [Owner of Mtisse Motorcycles] and Lee Morrison [Assistant Stunt Cordinator].

Special Feature: The Guys from U.N.C.L.E. [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:57] Here we take a look at the two lead actors of the film, Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. We also look into how the action sequences were made, including commentary from all involved with the film. Contributors include Lionel Wigram [Producer/Screenwriter], Guy Ritchie [Director/Producer/Screenwriter], Henry Cavill [Napoleon Solo], Jared Harris [Adrian Sanders], Alicia Vikander [Gaby], Armie Hammer [Illya Kuryakin], Luca Calvani [Alexander Vinciguerra], Dominic Tuohy [Special Effects Supervisor] and Paul Jennings [2nd Unit Director/Stunt Coordinator].

Special Feature: A Man of Extraordinary Talents [2015] 1080p] [1.78:1] [3:16] This very brief feature that is devoted to the Director Guy Ritchie, with comments from other members of the cast and crew, where we learn what the everyone thought of Guy Ritchie as a person and director, and I wish this had been a little more extensive, but we did learn that certain people taught Guy Ritchie to play the guitar and learn to play chess. Contributors include Henry Cavill [Napoleon Solo], ], Armie Hammer [Illya Kuryakin], Alicia Vikander [Gaby], Steven Clark-Hall [Producer], Luca Calvani [Alexander Vinciguerra], Hugh Grant [Alexander Waverly], Elizabeth Debicki [Victoria Vinciguerra] and Lionel Wigram [Producer/Screenwriter].

Special Feature: U.N.C.L.E. On-Set Spy [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [5:16] This bonus is divided into four short behind-the-scenes look at the shooting of the film. They included the following segments, which are as follows: Don't Swim Elegantly; You Want to Wrestle?; Heli Restored and A Family Thing. Contributors include Lionel Wigram [Producer/Screenwriter], Robert Hields [Helicopter Owner/Pilot] and Rory Gibb [Trainee Assistant Director]. One fascinating fact we find out about Robert Hields, is that he is known in Yorkshire as The Man With The Golden Touch, because the Hiller UH12 helicopter is better known as the aircraft Pussy Galore, played by Honor Blackman, flew in the 1964 James Bond classic, Goldfinger and we are told that Honor Blackman wouldnt actually go in it, so while it looks like Pussy Galore it is actually not Honor Blackman at the controls  its a bloke in a wig. As usual you can either watch them separately or Play All.

Finally, I grew up with The Man From U.N.C.L.E. TV series and it was one of my all-time favourite TV series when I was young, so my expectations were high and I thought I would be disappointed. On the contrary I was pleasantly surprised and certainly enjoyed the show, and I would say it's more for adults than for young children, but even youngsters should find it very entertaining. The acting form the two main actors were good and the characters were well played although certainly not along the same lines as the TV original series. THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. [2015] resurrects a glossy, Action-Packed 1960s pastiche homage to the original TV series. If you like Guy Ritchies other films like me, then you will almost certainly like this film. It's slick and stylish, and Henry Cavill is perfectly cast in the lead role. What impressed me the most about the film was how well they managed to capture the time period really well, especially for people who were not around in that period of time to know what it was like in the 1960s. The clothes, cars, architecture, and even the helicopters were all perfect, so it really felt like you were watching something that was filmed in the 1960s. This is a brilliant action packed film, from start to finish that has great potential, with hopefully a follow up from director Guy Ritchie in the very near future. Forget James Bond, now there are two new spies in town who are out to save the world! Highly Recommended!

I actually purchased my copy about halfway through that first viewing because I instantly loved it. I've watched it several times since then, and I typically go several months between movie viewings.
Everything about The Man From UNCLE is great. The entire cast is gorgeous, and plays their roles believably (finally a movie I like Armie Hammer in!) The set designs and wardrobe choices are perfect. The humour is witty, the action engaging without being gratuitous. The music and cinematography are a delightful homage to retro TV stylings.

are actual 60's songs or just 60's themed/60's like).  This is a fast paced and action
packed movie, but it does give you a rest and make you want to watch to see what
happens.  A good origin story to see how Napoleon Solo met Illya Kuryakin and
forced to work together that first time.  However their personalities are switched
from their 1960's T.V. incarnations, which makes them dealing with each other
very interesting.  The villains are great.  The character Gabby is a great addition,
one who can take care of herself and help out the guys.  There are not enough
female spies in movies or television today (though there are more than in the 1960's).

7292397,1,B00ZS21J6E,"Rebecca: This is so bad it's almost good.

Enid: This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again.

Felt far more like a dumbed-down version of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969) than a remake of a 1960's secret agent show. Ill-conceived and poorly executed attempt to cash in once again on the pre-sold audience for anything ""remotely"" related to the U.N.C.L.E. franchise.  Since the main appeal of the original 1960's television show was its campy take on the 60's secret agent craze,  a direction that the James Bond films would not take for another ten years,  viewers would expect a homage with more of the same.  This would mean cheapo production design,  unrealistic action sequences,  and Napoleon Solo in lip lock with six different beautiful young actresses every thirty minutes.  Unfortunately nobody associated with this production had much of a grasp on subtle or even unsubtle comedy and the thing is turned into an typical exercise in special effects excess and hyper-editing.  Pretty much the opposite of everything that gave the original series its charm.

The target for this box office disaster was ladies and pre-teen girls getting off on Superman/Clark Kent actor Henry Cavill;  whose minimalist acting style (or perhaps absence of acting talent) make him a worthy successor to expression challenged Robert Vaughn's Napoleon Solo.  But this is a prequel and we learn that the first time Napoleon and Illya operated as a team was in pre - U.N.C.L.E. days.  Robert Redford reboot Armie Hammer painfully plays the blonde Russian.  For obvious reasons Hammer has been the kiss of death for most of the movies in which he has appeared over the past ten years.  A ""Springtime for Hitler"" sort of thing.

In an effort to expand the target demographic the producers seem to have geared the promotional campaign around eye scorching Elizabeth Debicki who plays the bad girl.  Those viewing the film for that reason will be somewhat disappointed.  Although Debicki's performance is fine her screen time is brief and almost entirely in wide master shots.  And while the promotional campaign sets you up for  a decisive catfight sequence with the other actress (someone named Alicia Vikander);  nothing happens between them.  Despite all this Debicki easily wins the memorable character battle and you forget that Vikander and her tedious character were even in the film.

I mean the first time I saw it was on cable television,  but the thing was they played it so much that I got tired of seeing it. But what drew me to it was the moment in time, the early 1960's fashion, and the action and how. Solo decided to save the Russian knowing that later he would kill him. Well all the Russian spy wanted was his father's watch back, iila showed more control than solo,  solo had more sexual intensity  in the bedroom. And Gaby was a Tom boy. All in all it turned out to be an excellent movie.",1469923200,,581,4.078947368421052

I also do like the actors in this movie Armie Hammer, Henry Cavill and Hugh Grant, so I knew that I would enjoy the movie. I was born at the end of 1960, so having this in 60's time period was great.  I loved all the costume clothing and classic cars too.  The banter and chemistry of the characters, esp between Solo and Kuryakin was great and made the movie more fun for me.  The budding romance between Illya and Gaby added a tender part to it.  I have watched it many times already, as I get a kick out of the fun dialog and mannerisms.

Gaby is a fierce leading lady who I absolutely adored and though Henry Cavill as Solo was good, I preferred Armie Hammer as Illya Kuryakin a million times over. Yeah, he seemed so volatile in the beginning, but he'd been through a lot in the gulag and I loved watching his transformation into someone really likable.

Henry Cavill plays Napoleon Solo [To me he looks like Clark Kent in Superman movies].  Armie Hammer plays Ilya Kuryakin [looks like a taller Matt Damon].  Alicia Vikander plays the daughter of a scientist from Nazi Germany (modeled after Edward Teller, dubbed father of the hydrogen bomb).  She is Swedish.  Elizabeth Debicki plays a femme fatale.  She was in ""Everest"" and is also in the upcoming ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" and ""The God Particle"".  Shes Australian.  Hugh Grant plays a British intelligence agent,  Jared Harris plays Sanders, a CIA manager, and Misha Uznetsov [Russian] plays a KGB manager.

Yes, this is REALLY a fun movie to watch.  There is, of course, action.  There is sort of a romantic triangle among Solo, Kuryakin and Gaby [Gabriella Teller, the daughter of Dr. Teller].  But to my mind, the most fun of all was the constant competition between Solo and Kuryakin as to who is the better secret agent.

This script is very good.  The acting is quite good.  The pacing is great.  The cinematography is very good.  The musical score varies quite a bit, and at times it is wonderfully dramatic or suspenseful [abrupt changes in the musical tone perhaps reflect what the life of an intelligence agent under cover must feel like].  The plot is OK, but it mainly serves as a background on which these actors can play their roles.  There are some great lines, wonderfully delivered.  There is great, subtle comedy.  To describe it would be to spoil it.  We wouldn't want plot to distract us too much from just watching these characters.  This movie begs..nay, it SCREAMS for a sequel.  It fully deserves one.

Oh, and you have a new codename.
-Codename?
And rather a good one: U.N.C.L.E.

The above dialogue comes from this action comedy adventure spy film directed by Guy Ritchie.  It is based on the T.V. series of the same name which ran from 1964 to 1968. (U.N.C.L.E. stands for United Network Command for Law and Enforcement.)

Briefly, at the height of the Cold War (early 1960s), CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Man of Steels Henry Cavill) and KJB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) must put aside their hostilities to stop a mysterious international organization bent on threatening the delicate balance of world power.  These two sworn enemies now find themselves having a common mission: finding a kidnapped German scientist who is the key to penetrating this organization.

To tell you the truth, I did not have high hopes for this movie.  The negative reviews I read for it seemed to confirm my view.  However, I still watched it and found that it wasn't all that bad, had intriguing twists and turns,  and good action.  Then the last 25 minutes for this movie came.  I was blown away! (I conclude that the negative reviewers did not watch the entire movie.)

Everything came together nicely and I saw action sequences I had not seen before in the movies.  I was impressed!

I was especially impressed with the last five minutes.  There was no action during this time but the acting, in my opinion, was first-rate.

In my opinion, Henry Cavill as Solo absolutely nailed his part.  He brought the cool to this movie.  Apparently others who wanted to play this part included Tom Cruise, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, and Russell Crowe.

Oh, I forgot to mention one other person in this movie: Hugh Grant as Alexander Waverly.  (Waverly is a high ranking MI6 operative and eventual head of U.N.C.L.E.)  In this movie, Grant has few scenes but hes an absolute delight in all of them. (He is the one that utters the first and third lines in the above dialogue.)

I should tell you one other thing (which you might have deduced from the dialogue above).  This is NOT a U.N.C.L.E. movie!!  The above dialogue contains the LAST lines of this movie.  Thus, this is actually a pre-U.N.C.L.E movie where the U.N.C.L.E. team is assembled.

The U.N.C.L.E. team thats assembled consists of Solo, Kuryakin, Waverly, and a woman named Gabriella Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander).  I don't remember a women on the team in the original series but this may be a nod to The Girl from U.N.C.L.E which appeared on T.V. and lasted only one season (1966-1967).  Anyway, I thought this was a nice touch.

Other people that appear in this movie are international football star David Beckham, Hitler, and JFK.

The background music for this movie is just fantastic.  Listen for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. theme song.

Languages spoken besides English are Russian, German, and Italian.  These foreign languages are all sub-titled.

Film location were in London, England; the UK; and Italy.

When the end credits for this movie roll, DONT EXIT.  Why?  Because you can read the dossiers of the U.N.C.L.E. team.

This movie, so far, has earned about 1.5 times its operating budget.

Now for the big question: Would I watch a sequel to this movie?  You betcha.  (According to Waverly, their new assignment will be in Istanbul.)

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2015) has one extra.  It lasts seven minutes and I found it to be quite good.  Its too bad that there were no snippets from the original T.V. series.

In conclusion, this is a respectable movie that resurrects The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  What I learned from this movie: saving the world never goes out of style.

(2015;  1 hr, 50 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  12 scenes)

It's just delightful when the whole film comes to a screeching halt so Henry Cavill can sit in a truck and eat someone else's lunch while there's an on-fire boat chase going on in the background.

Armie Hammer was so good as the Russian with anger issues that I forgot he once also played a too-campy Lone Ranger.  Much to my surprise, Hugh Grant really managed to pull of the whole Chief Waverly vibe I recall from the original 1960s TV series.  The film has earned $190 million in world-wide revenues on a budget of only $75 million, so I'd hope that the studio would make a sequel, although a quick web search didn't turn up any evidence of plans for a sequel.

Apparently the character of Kuryakin is different?  I don't know anything about that, but I loved Kuryakin in this movie.  I think the dynamics between him, Solo, and Gaby were great.  They play off of each other well.  A part of this was the way the actors embraced their roles and had fun with them, and another part was the writing.  The script was pretty tight, and was a pleasant mix of serious and humorous.  I also liked the cinematography.

Guy Ritchie does a great job putting together an extremely fun and easy to follow story. Cavill and Hammer are excellent as the leads. Cavill is very charismatic as Solo. I'd love to seem him get to carry some of that charm into his Superman role. Hammer is a menace as Kuryakin...and I mean that as a complete compliment. The two of them play PERFECTLY off of each other. Solo derisively calling Kuryakin ""Red Peril"" and Kuryakin calling Solo ""Cowboy"" instead of their real names is a humorous nice touch. There are a lot of fun scenes in this movie with a few laugh out loud moments. The action scenes (especially the first car chase scene and the speedboat scene) are very well done. Vikander as Gaby is also very good. She plays very well as the reluctant love interest to Kuryakin. This was a fun action movie that BOTH a husband AND a wife can enjoy.

 Agent Solo (Henry Cavill) is in East Berlin working on a case in the disappearance of Udo Teller, a rocket scientist that Adolf Hitler knew of. Solo visits the daughter of Teller, Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), who refuses to give any answers about her father. Solo finds a bug device in his suitcase. After telling Gaby some truthful facts about her and her ""real father"", he asks Gaby if there is another way out of here. He hides in the back seat of the car she is driving.
  Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who is a KGB operative, is after Solo and continues this car chase after Solo with Gaby. Solo is quick to shoot at Kuryakin, however Kuryakin is quick to dodge the bullets. Illya stops going after Solo and Gaby as their car gets trapped in between buildings.

I'm not convinced by Henry Cavill's American accent.  It was obvious he was British from the first scene and ended up being distracting throughout the whole film. He takes on this radio-show voice.  While I understand this was to replicate the original show's character, it's also distracting with slowly delivered lines.  The movie is also quite predictable, unfortunately.  Betrayals and subsequent non-betrayals were easily foreseen.  I understand that Tom Cruise was originally slotted for the main role.  I can say that the fact Tom DIDN'T do this film was its saving grace.  That would've been worse.  If you want to watch a pretty film with great music that parody's the old spy stereotypes, have fun.

The cinematography was top notch, the costumes were brilliant and fit the settings fantastically. Imagine the themes of the sixties filmed with today's clarity and eye for beauty, the film succeeded in my opinion on all artistic levels.

Wit abounds with the banter between the principle actors and they seemed to fit together without being forced into it, almost as if they were having as much fun with each other as I did watching it play out.

Great cast, great locales, great acting and dialog, and superb cinematography, CGI, and great editing make this movie a real treat. The quips and humor offset the seriousness of a spy movie where people are attempting to kill each other in earnest. It's a SPY vs. SPY, East vs. West movie on par with the best of the cold war themed movies of the past.

If you ever wondered how Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuriakin (SP, most likely) every got together when watching the TV series, this movie handily provides a probable story arc with great panache and flourish.",1461283200,,639,4.747747747747748

Henry Cavill is great as art thief-turned- CIA operative Napoleon Solo, Armie Hammer is hilarious as KGB counterpart Ilya Kuryakin, and Alicia Vikander is perfect as the mysterious Gaby caught between them and a gang of nefarious global arms dealers. Guy Ritchie is masterful at shooting the spy-buddy dialogue, and the 60s Euro vibe is a visual spectacle. The film captures the feel of the original series well, adding comedic perspective to the spy genre without going ""Get Smart"" over the top.

The only thing in common with the series is the names of the characters.  Uncle is simply a code name that you hear once at the very, very, very end.

The characters are well chosen for their roles.  Obviously set up for potential sequels.  Might be fun if they try for at least one more while keeping the tongue in cheek humor.,1459123200,,327,4.47457627118644

7292711,5,B00ZS21J6E,Awesome!,1459123200,,8,8.0
7292712,5,B00ZS21J6E,"I'll be completely honest. I've never heard of the TV show this film is based on. And quite frankly, from the Previews I expected it to be absolute garbage. My wife wanted to see it, but I kept shooting it down with my objections that I didn't want to pay top dollar to see a film that looked terrible. And if past experience was anything to go I would have been absolutely right. The trailers played up the crudity, the corny acting, the sexiness, the stodginess, to the point where teens would think it boring, conservatives would think it objectionable, film buffs would think it worthless, and everyone else would think it a waste of time. I know deep in my heart I should never judge a film by it's trailer, and man oh man I was proven right about that and wrong about everything else this time around.

Again, completely honest. I expected this film to be awful. Not hilarious awful. AWFUL awful. I had just watched Spectre the night before, and while it was an improvement, the character of James Bond has morphed into a heartless cold monster I just really don't care about, to say nothing of his love interests. Contrast that with this film....

Characters You Will Love

Early on in this film I told me wife that it was quite clear why this film was so much better than Spectre: CHARACTER. Every character had personality, back-story, virtues, and flaws. They were human, and likable. Yes, there was some cheesiness to the accents, but the performances were pure gold and you just swallowed them hook, line, and sinker. More than that, the script, cinematography, music, and overall direction ensured that you were constantly engaged. At one point while we were watching this film I realized I need to get up to use the restroom. I couldn't. I just couldn't stop watching. Just go ahead and pause it my wife said. ""I can't pause it now!!!!"" I shouted at the action and tension escalated. Yes, this is a first. This is absolutely the first time in my life I've been so into a movie I couldn't get up for ANY reason because I had to watch what happened next.

The music

 Oh lord the music! The score is brilliant yes, the songs included perhaps moreso (if that's possible). The music is awesome. And then it combines with the cinematography... ""Wow."" Yeah, I found myself saying that a LOT while watching this film. Because the editing was so tight, the integration of the camera-work with the music so PERFECT that I was yelling ""Did you see that!!!???"" when all that happened was the action starting PERFECTLY in time with the music. Wow.

The cinematography

 I'm a fan of cinematography. I have been known to watch films for cinematography alone. This film has outstanding cinematography. It's GORGEOUS. The shots are extremely well thought-out. The slick montages you are used to seeing in a film's credits are actually used to convey action-scenes here and it's brilliant. There's a gorgeous pan-out camera shot that I'm sure must either be on a track or a wire, and I couldn't believe a great cinematic technique like this was present here (slow-pan out perfectly centered for dramatic effect) in an action/comedy. And there's also gorgeous shots of the actors, and the locations, and, and...wow!!!!

The Script

I've heard some great scripts in my day, but this is something special. The jokes are at times laugh-out-loud hilarious, but always endlessly clever. There's no need for crude gross-out humor here (there's a few sly innuendos but even those are classier than most). The banter between characters about CLOTHES is more engaging than the plot of most films, and the interplay between the leads is endlessly entertaining. Really, the script is razor-sharp and full of charm and wit.

The editing

Ah, the editing. That's where a film truly lives isn't it? This film is absolutely brought to life my fabulous editing. The action is always moving, the plot always progressing, the relationships building and evolving, and it's all ENTERTAINING thanks to incredible editing. Again, montages of things that would be cornerstones of other films. Delicious comic and action timing.

At the end of this film during a great chase sequence I was completely on the edge of my seat, and realized in that moment that this is a film you could start watching at any point, knowing nothing about the plot, and get completely sucked in. It's just that well put together.

The whole package

This film should have been nominated for Best Score, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Script, and Best Editing, with an honorable mention for Costume Design and Acting all-around. But really, it's the way these things work together that's an absolute symphony of film-making. When a character gets angry, he clenches his fist, his expression changes (a little), the music changes, the bass kicking in, the music slowing down. You feel the tension. When a character knows he has been drugged, he cheerfully lays down on a couch, explaining he once hit his head during a similar experience. Endlessly clever, smart, brilliant, entertaining, awesome. The common tropes of lesser spy films are stepped over skillfully, making you feel smarter for having watched this film. And yet...

At it's heart, this is a cheerful homage to spy films with loads of charm, that leaves you feeling good at the end. It's SO clever that it actually ""ends"" and keeps going, not due to poor writing, but due to EXCELLENT writing. You think it's all over and the film grabs you AGAIN.

When a character starting eating a sandwich during an action scene, my wife turned to me and said we need to buy this film. I quite agree. You should buy it too. It was a box-office bomb but that was marketing's fault, not anyone who worked on this masterpiece.

I only wish I HAD seen it in the theater...with Dolby Atmos...that would have been awesome...I'm kicking myself right now....",1459123200,,5860,4.807157057654075

7292817,5,B00ZS21J6E,"This was a really fun movie. It doesn't have a lot of explosion or stunt but it has a lot of hight quality funny moments and great acting, beautiful scenary, well done mis-en-scne, action and good music.
Also one of the risng star actress Alicia Vikander was never been more beautiful. She was so pretty.
Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer duo as CIA, KGI agent and they were so funny and fun to watch. They teamed up to solve the problem but the thing is they cannot believe each other till the end. And at the same time, they save each other's neck.
 Alicia Vikander was kind of in between and she was like an oasis from this film. Whenever she apprears, I felt so good. She made the movie so delightful.
Also her dancing sequence was one of the most cute moment from the film.
There are no 007 cars and equipments to watch but this movie is more of a charactor driven funny movie.
If you have a doubt of spy old fashioned comedy, don't even hesitate cause this will make you feel good and want you to watch it again right after the movie is finished.
The movie is also not so long. It is no longer then 2 hours and there are so many things to watch.
The mis-en-scene was beautiful as well.
When two agents are quarreling on the front side of the screen, the hostage on the electric chair, because the chair didn't worked, they put the electric to the highest level, and they were chatting on the other room. They didn't know that the chair is on fire. Now we see the hostage is buring and we see two agents are still quarrelling on the front side. That momet is one of the funniest moment from the film and it is the example how the director played with the mis-en-scene.
Guy Riche is already a famous director since 90s. He already made great films like <Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels><Snatch><RocknRolla>
He also made boxoffice hit movies <Sherlock Holmes 1,2> Which I don't like at all.
This is one of the atmost greatest film he made. It is sad that it didn't had a major hit at the boxoffice.",1456876800,,2001,4.321808510638298

It has the tongue-in-cheek more in tune with the first season of the television series and the John Steed Emma Peel Avengers. I'm still not happy with the choice of music and several scenes were too distracting how they were filmed, but the more I watch it, the more it grows on me. I wish they would have done better at the box office because I would have liked to seen where the franchise would have gone.",1456876800,,534,4.35
7292824,1,B00ZS21J6E,"If you are looking for the old tv show, forget this film. It has absolutely nothing to do with the 1960's series. Yes, they use the same character names but that is all. The convoluted backstory is that Napoleon Solo was a World War II soldier who become an art thief after the war and is working for the CIA in order to avoid incarceration. Solo is played by actor Henry Cavill who is just awful. It is hard to tell whether the writing is just terrible or he was directed to be a parody of the original character. Illya Kuryakin is now a Soviet agent, pretty much a thug. The story line is predictable and uninspired...typical bad guys trying to develop an nuclear weapon while pretty girl helps secret agents thwart the plot. How many times has that been done in the last fifty years. The title is ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and this is a total fraud. U.N.C.L.E. is referred to only once...the very last word of the movie. I am sure that the intent is that the producer can now make a series of future ""U.N.C.L.E."" films in order to extort more money from the viewing public. Robert Vaughn and David McCallum were always classy, irreverent, and dignified in the original series fighting the mysterious forces of THRUSH. This film does them a disservice and is an embarrassment.",1456790400,,1278,4.536796536796537

7292834,4,B00ZS21J6E,"This movie was not what I expected, but it proved to be better in the long run.  As with most any movie based on a former TV series, you have to go into it with lower expectations.  There was no UNCLE Headquarters building.  There was no little tailor shop entrance.  There were no female UNCLE staff swooning over Solo.  This was a high action introduction into how Solo and Kuryakin first meet, arranged by Waverly.  Once you push any possible resemblance to the original series out of your head, the movie takes off at high speed with action, humor and conflict.  I do hope Guy Ritchie will do a second movie, more along the feel of the original UNCLE now that introductions have been made.  Let's get Waverly into headquarters and let's open the movie with the usual flair and cloak & dagger style.  I've waited a long time for this movie, let's now go the same route as the original Star Trek movies and create a second film more in tune with fan expectations.  I don't think this will ever happen, though.",1456704000,,1011,4.475409836065574

7292910,5,B00ZS21J6E,"LOVED this movie! I am a fan of the original series but will not make 'unfair' comparisons between those and this movie. It does detour a bit from TV series but also pays homage to the spirit of the original franchise. At the end of the day this movie stands on its own two feet and does so strongly. The action is there but not gratuitous. The international locations are lush & exotic and better put on display than the best of Bond movies in my opinion. The wardrobe, vehicles, props (down to smallest of details) and overall aesthetic is meticulous and splendid. I am a lifelong Bond fan (and British inspired spy TV series too) but confess that I felt this movie surpassed a Bond movie in a number of ways. It's the full package and was not given the respect and admiration it was due in my opinion. It was sophisticated, exotic, action fueled in all the 'right' ways, sexy and even a bit humorous at times (again in all the right ways). Great film, the best of it's type/genre in a very long time.",1455667200,3,1003,4.3689839572192515

7292917,3,B00ZS21J6E,"The story was fun, the action was fun, and the plot twists were enjoyable. The acting was decent. The locations were enjoyable to see. However, I did not enjoy watching this film for two reasons. The first reason is because many of the scenes are shown twice. The first time the scene is shown, information is deliberately left out, even though the information that is left out is not too difficult for thinking audience members to discern. Then, almost instantly, the scene is shown again filling in the missing information. Were the filmmakers deliberately trying to pad the running time of the film by showing everything twice? This was both irritating and unnecessary. In addition, the split screen scenes added nothing and just increased the aggravation of watching this movie. This could have been much better. Touches that I'm assuming were meant to be touches of artistic flair made the movie tedious and annoying.",1455580800,,922,4.9935064935064934

7292963,5,B00ZS21J6E,"I cannot explain it but I absolutely adore this movie.  Guy Ritchie seems to have the whole frenemy dynamic down to perfection.  I never saw the original show so I don't know how it compares to that, but the chemistry between the lead actors is absolutely delightful.  The stunts are fun; the costumes, gorgeous; the casting, spot-on.  I have seriously fallen in love with Armie Hammer as Ilya and will never be satisfied seeing him in any role in which he doesn't have a Russian accent.  Henry Cavill, who I really did not care for as Superman, is perfect as Napoleon Solo.  Alicia Vikander, who I first noticed in ""Ex Machina,"" is incredibly adept at combining vulnerability and strength.  Elizabeth Debicki reminds me of a slinky, sensual, well-groomed cat and does a masterful job at combining sexual charisma with pure evil.  Hugh Grant is, of course, Hugh Grant.  'Nuff said.  It's not a movie of great depth but it is, instead, a fun romp that never takes itself too seriously.  The stunts are fresh, the dialogue has spice, and the acting is just so much fun to watch.  I sincerely hope Ritchie directs a second installment or I will be sorely disappointed.  Between this movie and ""Kingsman"", I'm going to wear out my Blu-Ray player because there's just something about both movies that makes me want to watch them again and again and again.  In fact, neither movie has yet to find their place in my disc racks because I watch them so often.  Oh, did I mention how much I love this movie?  ;-)",1455062400,,1502,4.611320754716981

7292999,4,B00ZS21J6E,"The Good:

Surprisingly enough, this movie found an interesting way of mixing suspense, action, drama and comedy all together. If you're a fan of director Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes 1 & 2, Snatch) then you'll probably be familiar with this movie's unique style. You'll notice interesting camera work and fun montages that give the movie a different look and feel compared to others. One of the best highlights are the fights and interactions between characters portrayed by Henry Cavill (The American) and  Armie Hammer (The Russian). One memorable moment is a particular techniquethat the Russian performs that may have you feeling as though you've been hit yourself. Oh and as for the plot, there was a very nice twist that you won't necessarily see coming that really gave the movie a little bit more depth.

The Bad:

The main villain(s) seemed a bit weak. So much of the film is spent building up both Cavill and Hammer's characters that when it finally comes to the villains, the villains just don't seem to even pose much of a challenge. I'm not sure this is really a ""Bad"" but for the longest time in the movie, it took me a while to stop thinking that Henry Cavill was Clark Kent or Superman (From Man of Steel). He just looks so physically imposing during some scenes, and that contrasts his actual character who's not much of a fighter and more of a ladies man.

The Reason:

I suppose the best way to describe this movie would be like if they made a James Bond film with comedic scenes throughout. I went into this film with little to no expectations. Nevertheless, the movie was fun, action-packed, and entertaining to watch. I think it's a fun movie to watch and I don't think many will mind watching it in theaters either. See it when you get the chance.

The Rating: 8/10

Excellent casting all round with Cavill being surprisingly spot on with his interpretation of Napoleon Solo. He respectfully delivers enough of the style and mannerism of Robert Vaughn's original character yet manages to quite definitely make this role his own!

7293093,4,B00ZS21J6E,"In the original series Solo and Kuryakin were obviously good friends. This movie shows a very plausible explanation not only as to how the two might have met, but how they each got into the spy business. Once I got past the initial physical disparity between David McCallum and Armie Hammer, I thought Hammer and Cavill did a great job of portraying the characters McCallum and Vaughn had created. As I watched the movie I could easily see Robert Vaughn and David McCallum in the movie roles. (The jury is still out on Hugh Grant as Waverly) It seems like this movie laid the groundwork for sequels, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. If this becomes a series, it could be 5 stars, but if this is the end, it left too many open questions about the spies, and the creation of U.N.C.L.E. (which can actually trace it's beginnings back to Ian Flemming's Dr. No.)

As a fan of The Man From U.N.C.L.E., I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. There's nothing (so far) to detract from the TV series.",1454284800,,995,4.437158469945355

We really didn't like the multiple screens and withdrawal or 'distancing' from the 'action', though grateful there weren't any of the latest shock tricks of splattering blood and body parts everywhere.  The movie came across as a series of  'set up scenes' to move the story along, but without cohesiveness, and the musical score detracted from any tension built up.  The actors were 'pretty', but their 'comedic scenes', were not involved in the script--as in 'too cool' for the good of the plot, and it made us not care about them or the outcome--which again, goes back to the writers, dialogue and directing.

Finding acceptable modern equivalents to the original characters of Solo, Kuryakin and even Mr. Waverley may only be of importance to older generations who grew up with the original TV series, so it made a pleasant surprise to find that Ritchie had done well with the new actors in making it more contemporary while maintaining the humor and style of the original. Fun was had with editing some of the action out until revealing it in a couple of the climactic sequences - all adding to great pacing. Nods to the costuming and gizmos of the first UNCLE were coupled with some great locations and fashions. I don't think the script was meant to be Shakespeare and much of the characterization (of the supporting characters in particular) was likewise pretty stock, but that didn't spoil it for me in the sixties any more than it did in this rendition.

He successfully takes us on a spirited ride that pulsates and breathes the stylish upper class lifestyle of the 1960s. I loved this hip and slick movie. The leads (Armie Hammer  Henry Cavill, and Alicia Vikander) are sexy, funny and oh so cool in a film set and the Cold War era of the 1960s. The story begins with CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Hammer) getting Gaby Teller (Vikander) to defect to West Germany. They eventually unite under a mysterious MI^ supervisor (Hugh Grant) with the KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) who at first is their foe to stop a family of criminals intent on using Ms. Teller's father's design for a portable nuclear device The ride is fun and the movie score is jazzy cool.

Knowing it was going to get a drastic update from the original TV series, about the only thing remaining was a couple of the names, the era and the fact that it had to do with spies. That being said, once the movie finally got rolling, after the obligatory character development in the first fifteen minutes, things got interesting.

Even though the movie started right away with a chase scene, I didn't connect much with it until the characters all came together and showed a bit of chemistry and humor. By then, I engaged in the story.

The annoying subtitles were at least, for the most part, large enough to read easy. There were quite a few of them, but at least they were parsed out.

There were a few instances where I had to cry foul at technology they wouldnt have had back then, even suspending my disbelief, but I gave it a pass because by then, I was well into the story and having fun.

I liked the actors and admit they fit the roles pretty well, if not completely different from the originals. Also, as an introduction movie to a possible series, wellyou have to see for yourself how the title came about and tied in.

Overall, it wasn't something I wouldve gone to the theater to see, but for a rental, it was well worth it. Recommended.",1452988800,,1309,4.392561983471074

7293316,2,B00ZS21J6E,"The iconic 60s series gets a disappointing film adaptation, in large part because director Guy Ritchie and the four screenwriters -- they needed four to put this together? -- pretty much ignored what made the TV series successful. Flashy use of CGI film transitions does not a movie make, and a series of setpieces does not a story make. Ritchie concentrates on being stylish, but the sad truth is that this film has no style. The one plus is Armie Hammer's Illya Kuryakin; he proves a worthy successor to David McCallum. As for Henry Cavill's Napoleon Solo, he can't hold a candle to Robert Vaughn's embodiment of the role. Cavill is not so much a leading man as he is a leading manikin.

But that's where it ends.  It's a mystery why they paid for the rights to the name as there is no similarity to the Man From UNCLE.  What's missing?  Humor, cleverness, good acting and characters who actually like each other.  Both leads are so incredibly stiff, it's unbelievable.  Henry Cavill struts around, speaking like he's reading cue cards, with this weird vocal affectation.  The guy who plays Illya, might have been ok if he showed a little personality but he's working too hard at being a stereotype.  The young lady (from Ex-Machina) is good and Hugh Grant is the only one who doesn't seem uncomfortable.

There are a few very slight laughs.  But again, this could be any of a million secret agent movies and not one of the better ones.  At the beginning, it says they consulted with Norman Felton.  This sounds about right since he died in 2012.",1452384000,,1094,4.543589743589743

7293339,4,B00ZS21J6E,"The Man from UNCLE is my all-time favorite TV show, I've waited years for a serious UNCLE film to be made.  I've seen this film twice in the movies and once on blu-ray.  It is a good film, not a great one.
My problems with the film are two-fold.  First I do not understand why the characters had to be changed so drastically.  Solo is now a master thief blackmailed into working for the CIA.  More like Robert Wagner as Al Mundy in It Takes A Thief than the Solo we all knew.  Illya is now a massive physical specimen, almost psychotic at times and capable of ripping cars apart.  If they gave him steel teeth, they could have called him ""Jaws."" (Not quite like David McCallum in any way although McCallum has been quoted as saying that he saw and enjoyed the film.)  Alexander Waverly (whose first name is never used in the film) is a recovering substance abuser according to his dossier seen at the end of the film.  This I don't get at all.
My only other criticism is that the action scenes are average at best.  The motor boat scene where Solo relaxes and munches a sandwich while Illya is chased by the bad guys is silly.  (Sadly this is the only scene where we hear a snippet of the UNCLE theme, as Solo listens to the radio.) The car chase near the end with Solo in an all-terrain vehicle and Illya on a motorcycle is average at best.  There could have been a good action scene where Solo, Illya and a group of British commandos assault the villain's base, but it ends much too soon.
Despite all my criticisms, this is still an enjoyable film  Henry Cavell is good as Solo. (Looking forward to his return as Superman in Superman V Batman this March.)  Armie Hammer seems incredibly miscast as Illya.  Still he did a good job (and was a lot better than the last time I saw him in that silly Lone Ranger film.)  Alicia Vikander was wonderful as Gaby, the German girl, who becomes part of the team.  Looks like she could have become a regular should they make another UNCLE film (which I doubt.)  Elizabeth Dubicki is tall and stunning as the villainess of the piece, great potential as a future Bond girl.  As so many have set, the 1960's costume design is outstanding. The soundtrack is relatively weird with some of the music resembling a Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leone western, the UNCLE theme should have been used in this film.
The special features on the blu-ray are okay.  Several short features on the making of the film, the 1960's costume and set design, the actors, the director Guy Ritchie, etc.  There is a pointless feature with Armie Hammer trying out the motorcycle for the film and visiting the factory where it was made.  I was hoping for deleted scenes, there are none.  There are also no trailers.
As stated, if you are expecting anything resembling the UNCLE tv show, you will be disappointed.  This is an enjoyable action film with nothing of the size and scope of your average Bond film, it is good, just not great.",1452297600,,2940,4.452336448598131

7293343,5,B00ZS21J6E,"I've seen the entirety of the original Man from U.N.C.L.E. television show.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I can be honest: it was repetitious, cheaply made, and often fairly stupid.  Fun, but stupid -- not to mention extremely low budget.

I had pretty low hopes when I went into this film.  I'd read some review that said it deviated pretty far from its source material, and so I decided to watch the film entirely on its own merits and disconnected from the source material.  Well, first off: it does *not* deviate far from its source material.  It loves its source material.  It's constantly making jokes and references -- and jokes out of love, not scorn.  The car chases, the fact that Illya Kuryakin does fashion critique (in the 10 years after film he's a fashion designer), the fact that Waverly occasionally mispronounces ""Kuryakin,"" and quite a few more things I can't say without spoilers.  The makers knew the television show incredibly well and they loved it and they did it proud.

Better yet, they didn't feel bound to it.  While staying true to it, they expanded the (admittedly) cardboard characters into more fleshed out, interesting characters.  Solo became more likeable and interesting and charming; Kuryakin remained excellent but became rather more Russian.  I would go so far as to say that this film is what the television show desperately wanted to be -- if only it had had the time and budget.

I watched the film with my sister, who's never seen a single episode of the original, and she agreed with me: she, ignorant of its source, could feel the love of the original oozing through the pores of that film.  But at the same time, she agreed that you don't need to like or even know the show to think this an excellent film.

This is, in short, one of the best if not the best adaptation I've ever seen of any source material and is, besides, fun, exciting, clever, and immensely enjoyable.",1452124800,4,1918,4.6805970149253735

7293383,4,B00ZS21J6E,"I loved the original show (hey, I was a kid) and didn't expect much because Hollywood tends to screw up remakes of old shows.  I was pleasantly surprised by Henry Cavill's performance - he must have studied the original episodes in great detail, because at times he sounded like the original. But that's English acting all over -- they teach actors how to speak believably in different parts.  I don't know why they cast Illya as somebody huge and psychotic; I can see how it might work but most Russian kids from that era didn't grow big because, hello, WWII, food shortages.  And with all the care they gave to languages, having a German leading lady who didn't even have an accent was just stupid (A German-speaking friend tells me even her German was awful.)

These people needed to do some research.  The slang was not appropriate.  And dear ghod, wasn't anybody in production alive in teh 1960's?  A COMPUTER DISK WOULD HAVE BEEN HUGE.  And HEAVY.  And DELICATE.  It would have made more sense to have it on a piece of microfilm.  Do your homework next time.

With all the disappointments, the actors did a good job and I hope there's another film, but I DO hope they give that actress some training in accents.",1451433600,,1217,4.583333333333333

I liked this more than its 75 rotten tomatoes rating, even though it's not quite a whole 5 stars.  It's a welcome respite from the over-the-top, city-leveling epics we've been getting lately.  It's an older kind of movie, with a smaller cast of archetypical characters - who all appear to be subject to the laws of physics.  The '60s atmosphere is faithful - to the 1960s we know from 1960s movies at least.  I wouldn't want slavish devotion to the old TV show, which was entertaining, but let's face it, often stupid.  This is better, in fact, it's about the best I think can be done while staying within the concept and not making an entirely different movie.  I enjoyed Armie Hammer's more-intense version of Kuryakin.  Henry Cavill was pretty good as Nappy Solo, although his flat monotone delivery was - at times - mildly annoying.  And Alicia Vikander did what was needed very well.  Maybe she gets more to do next outing.  I didn't take to Hugh Grant as Mr Waverly, I thought the role needed an older more world-weary guy, like (say) Bill Nighy.  But then after all, this movie is about looks.

7293420,4,B00ZS21J6E,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) began as a television series, running form 1964 - 1968  a stylish, sophisticated spy series that in many ways broke the ice for the plethora of offshoots that followed an still imitate).  Now along comes (groan) another remake of a fine original  this time altered on every level by Guy Ritchie in an attempt to make it compete with the many and constant spy thrillers that flood both the television and theater screens. Does it work? That depends on the viewers history and tolerance.

Ritchie did cast the film with classy actors and that helps. Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander manage to infuse some style into this otherwise heavy-handed caper film.

The story is capsulized as follows: In the 1960s with the Cold War in play, CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) successfully helps Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) defect to West Germany despite the intimidating opposition of KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). Later, all three unexpectedly find themselves working together in a joint mission to stop a private criminal organization from using Gaby's father's scientific expertise to construct their own nuclear bomb. Through clenched teeth and stylish poise, all three must find a way to cooperate for the sake of world peace, even as they each pursue their own agendas.

Fill out the cast with such figures as Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Debicki and Sylvester Groth and the style remains intact despite the Guy Ritchie attempts to modernize the concept and story line. A bit long  - both in the tooth and in length  there are still moments that remind us of how excellent the original truly was. Grady Harp, December 15",1451088000,3,1715,4.972027972027972

Nice production and costume design, recreating a 1960's look, but trashes the original concept on which it is based. Most debilitating is the performance of Henry Cavill, who delivers every line in an annoying monotone that grows wearying quite early on and sounds dubbed. While I realize this was probably the fault mainly of Guy Ritchie, the director, Cavill himself does not have the oily, tongue-in-cheek charm that made Robert Vaughan's Napoleon Solo so much fun each week. And for those who remember what an instant sensation David McCallum's little boy charm and Beatles-style haircut were with the ladies, Armie Hammer's brooding slab of meat will be a severe disappointment.",1451001600,,751,5.214876033057851

There's a few car chase ones, you can see how they're done if you get the DVD version with extras on it.  I actually didn't like the one in Berlin so much with the synchronised cars as it looked obviously fake to me as it was too in unison but they rave about it in the extras and you can see how they achieved that in those extras, where we are also told they were fully aware the buggy in the end wasn't invented at the time the film was set.

The last 45 minutes were so boring, anyone with at least half a brain could tell what was going to happen from one scene to the next. They try to add humor and 1960s spy style to it since it is a remake, but it doesn't help the fact that there really is no story or plot here. The humor by the way is just playful banter between the American spy and the Russian spy and it is not as funny as much as it is annoying at times. They begin to explain way too much about what is happening during the middle of the movie, just in case you fell asleep or have never since an old 1960s spy show/movie before. It was very unnecessary to backtrack over old scenes and explain what is happening since it was already so obvious.

7293486,4,B00ZS21J6E,"I must admit that I was prepared not to like this movie.
At all.
There were many reasons for that including the fact that it is yet another in a long line of Hollywood films that have attempted to capitalize on successful Sixties television programs. Some have been better than others: The first ""Charlie's Angels"" remake was, for example, pretty good (the sequel, not so much.) The remake of ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" however, was just awful despite a very hot-looking Jessica Simpson in heels and Daisy Duke shorts.
Despite my prior misgivings, however, I found myself liking ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" more and more with each passing minute. I think that's because it made no attempt to copy the television series. In fact, apart from the names of the major characters, it bore virtually no resemblance to the original.
For example, in this version American operative Napoleon Solo works for the CIA because if he doesn't he's going to do a long stretch in prison for stealing art and artifacts from post-war Europe. He's as smooth an operator as the original Solo - played by Robert Vaughn - but he's a criminal at heart. Russian KGB agent Ilya Kuryakin, meanwhile, spends a good share of the movie trying to kill Solo and is virtually forced to work with him ""for the greater good."" Unlike the slender David McCallum, who played Kuryakin in the television series, this version of the Russian agent is played by Armie Hammer as a physically imposing spy who can, among other things, rip pieces off moving vehicles.
And, unlike the television series, there is a third member of the team - an East German woman who happens to be the daughter of a nuclear scientist.
There's plenty of action, some snappy dialogue, some twists, and more than a little humor in this movie. The costuming and make-up are representative of the times, the vehicles (except for one) are vintage and the music is appropriate. The cinematography is also interesting, complete with a number of split-screen shots that were all the rage in the Sixties.
On balance, this is an enjoyable movie that clearly sets the stage for at least one sequel.",1450051200,11,2116,4.784153005464481

Reluctant buddy-factor action spy movie with wonderful dialog? Check.
Beautiful people everywhere doing cool things? Check.
Good action? Check.

It's really the dialog and chemistry between the two leads that reeled me in here; it just works.

This isn't a classic Ritchie like lock-stock or Rockn'Rolla (which was great) in that the characters don't have razor-sharp deliveries with really thick accents that are almost too hard to follow, but the dialog/comments/quips are great and tight. No sloppy/stupid/wasted lines, I was very satisfied all the way through.

Top of the above with the movie being set in the early 1960s yet vehicles, technology and even sayings that were invented till the 80s or even 90s abound. This makes the already plot thin, gag-ridden spy/espionage movie seem like the work of amateur.

'Napoleon Solo' and 'David McCullum' played his Soviet-Counterpart 'Illya Kuryakin' - the two were paired up to
fight International espionage, their key adversary - 'T.H.R.U.S.H'
The series ran between 1964 and 1968 (many will remember watching it for sure)
The film is somewhat more enjoyable than many critics suggested in truth -
The 60's - The Cold War - A stand-off between the West and the Soviet Union.......troubled times.
Illya Kuryakin' (Armie Hammer) a Soviet-Agent is assigned to track-down and kill 'Napoleon Solo' (Henry Cavill) a key
American-Agent who is on a mission in Berlin, he's in contact with 'Gaby' (Alicia Vikander) who's real father a German
Scientist has been kidnapped by a criminal organisation to develop a 'Nuclear-Device' to further destabilise the fragile
stand-off between the two Super-Powers, the Organisation is led by 'Victoria' (Elizabeth Debicki)
After a run-in between 'Napoleon' and 'Illya' the two suddenly find themselves instructed to work alongside each other
to track down the Organisation and prevent the sale of the nuclear device and subsequent consequences.
'Gaby' unbeknown to the two an agent for the British joins them as her contacts could prove useful to the op'
The unlikely pairing having to watch each others backs if they are to successfully complete their mission.
The film has to a large extent remained faithful to the feel of the 60's series with authentic props and clothing, the
lead actors however do put their own spin into the lead roles.
The film is a fun-romp with some enjoyable action sequences along the way, definitely worth a spin, especially if a
fan of the original series.

I think they should have made it more like the original series it would have been more entertaining, especially considering they called it by the same book and TV series title.

Henry Cavil (Napoleon Solo) plays a character with such a monotone voice it feels like I'm listening to Peter Dinklage voice Ghost from Destiny. The one liners, back and forth banter between his partner with a forgettable name and just overall bland acting makes the movie hard to watch. Not to mention Alicia Vikander who played the stereotypical female in spy movies. Gets introduced in an interesting way and then just ends up needing to be saved or acts like the mother (in her characters own words) of the two masculine spys. Stoping them in a middle of every supposedly funny back and forth banter. The overall plot was also pretty lacking I mean an secret crime organization trying to build an atomic bomb.

I felt it was a bit short on actual plot, being all about chasing the ""McGuffin"", but if I looked at it as a homage to sixties movies I have to say I loved it. For the current viewer of super hero films it's too slow, (so pass on 17 year olds), but for those with patience there's a sweet little car chase and droll humor worth waiting for. I like Henry Cavill, (usually gushed over for his good looks), because he has always been able to convey a sense of heartache (I Capture the Castle) or even tragedy (Tristan and Isolde) with a light and believable touch. here it's Napoleon's world weariness. Armie Hammer was a surprise as Illya, and displayed good comic timing. The plot could have been a bit thicker, but it would have failed to convey it's unflinching sense of right vs.wrong that existed in 60s films.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the recent Bond films. . .but they just don't have the feel of the older movies.  This movie is set during the heart of the Cold War, and the props, architecture, and attire reflect that.  Strangely, the filming itself is decidedly modern by contrast. . even though there are plenty of odd-ball split-screens and such which I think were intended to capture a 60's/70's feel.

For perhaps the first 5 minutes or so, I didn't think I was going to get into this movie.  After Man of Steel, it was actually hard for me to see Caville on screen, and NOT think of him as Clark Kent.  It wasn't until Caville and Hammer started playing off against one another that the movie really came into its own.  Once it did though, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Unlike conventional spy thrillers, this film doesn't find the right balance between humour, action and realistic portrayal. All aspects of the film seem to be 'off' in some fashion, and the long boring dialogues are meaningless and not worth listening to. The action is brief and while some of it is a bit imaginative, a lot of it is just a bunch of old cliches of post-war era that not many people would understand or appreciate. Neither the CIA nor KGB are portrayed in a realistic fashion, so if the film was going for realism, they got it seriously wrong. Some scenes of the film are just ridiculous and makes you feel like you're watching Just Cause 3 footage. Even the supposedly funny scene of the mad doctor frying himself is made less funny by the way it is presented.

I do think the movie does a nice job at giving that classic sort of 60s feel to the film in terms of how it was filmed and portrayed.  The movie is a nice classic spy action movie that may lack the flash of say a Bond movie but makes up for it in a style that it makes all its own.  There is a nice mix of action and some laughs although at times a bit campy humor but the campiness of the humor doesnt ruin the movie at all, it seems to fit in well to the 60s feel of the movie.  The acting is solid and the chemistry between the two main characters Solo and Kuryakin is evident in both the serious and less serious scenes.  Maybe this movies storyline isn't perfect and I am sure those that are more familiar with the original TV series will have some issues with this, but as an entertaining and fun movie, I found it to be just that and worth watching.

7293557,1,B00ZS21J6E,"The M.O.R.O.N. from UK,
Face it, Guy Ritchie is a dumb, dumb, moron. His idea of film art is to stitch together a string of action movie cliches from two or three generations of corny, but original stuff. And this movie just took the idea of cliche to a new low. I understand that poor Ritchie, with all his heaving and grunting, is unable to create original work because of his mental impairment and all, but do the rest of us have to keep smelling it?  What he did have going for him was his daddy's money and a few years of Madonna's clout. Ultimately, though, that powerhouse combination of old British money and glitzy McDonna resulted in one cinematic turd after another. It's too bad that talented people like Vikander get pulled down into such high-budget cesspools. Vikander has since redeemed herself with much better work such as Ex Machina, but Ritchie as descended further into a weird post-Madonna miasma of bar fights and bimbos and movie-making that just gets progressively dumber. Therapy is in order for Ritchie, not another movie, please.",1449360000,,1057,4.775956284153006

And judged on its own merit, the movie falls horribly flat. I've liked Henry Cavill in other roles, and I have even wondered if he might make a good James Bond when Craig retires the role.

They do not even reveal in the movie what U.N.C.L.E. stands for. And no character background or development until the credits roll, with the 3 agents' ""dossiers"" briefly shown. Man who starts UNCLE  is not revealed until the very end, so you can bet  on sequels just as bad I'm afraid. Romance sub-plot between agents is childish, to be developed in sequels I'm sure. Hugh Grant looks old & tired. Long fall for him Grant from such roles as Notting Hill. Movie has dry Brit influence.",1449273600,4,632,4.633928571428571

Warning: There is not a lot of action. There are many chase scenes, but the movie is more build up and espionage instead of the more common action packed movies most are used to. When there is action it is normally kept very short. On the other hand there are many chase scenes that are interesting and a great amount of fun to watch.

Gone were the cool gadgets, the cool music and even the cool organization. Just a couple of cold war spies out for (literal) kicks. I like the characters, I will give it that. Solo and Kuryakin were nicely done albeit sans the comedy of the original series. It seemed rather obvious that the name of the title was merely to garner box office support as it bore little resemblance to, and was in no way an homage to the show from the sixties.

The opening scene grabbed my interest with a really good vibe of subtle espionage, and then it mostly fell apart after that with glimmers of interesting moments similar to the opening but mostly it felt very fragmented. It was poorly acted (especially the lead woman who couldn't do much more than pout) and the slow developing utterly predictable plot was boring. As if that wasn't enough, I thought the music was the real low point overall. It just failed to add any ambiance and many of the selections were genuinely bizarre and kind of eclectic or just plain weird, and then to add insult to injury they threw in some ferocious hard rock guitar music and ruined the mountainside chase which turned out to be the most interestingly cinematic sequence in the whole film. Overall it had zero flow or direction and no sense of tension.

Straight up villains, minor but foreseeable plot twists, and plenty of action scenes. Where I think this movie does well, is adding humor and enjoyment to the mix. The characters have some fun dynamics and overall it is a movie that when you sit down and watch, you are left feeling good and unwound.

It tried to be a throwback to the ""slick"" TV shows of the 60's. There were transitions from one scene to another where the screen would slit into multiple images taking the action from one character to another. All this did is take the viewer out of the action. The problem with this is that it feels like a 60's show which is now dated and cheesy. Overall, the movie had more of a cheesy feel than a gritty feel. I guess they were trying to avoid the gritty Bourne type action. Maybe it didn't want to take itself seriously. If so, then they succeeded.",1449187200,,673,4.224806201550388

Without a ton of heavy marketing, I was led to believe that this was a staid period piece-throwback, to an older slower paced movie that was heavy on cold war conflict and low on action. Wrong, Wrong, & Wrong! This was one of my pleasant surprises of 2015 and also one of my favorite movies of the year. Better than SPECTRE? Maybe. It bears the unmistakeable style of Guy Richie with action sequences that setup perfectly interspaced sections of humor that you don't really get with the new Bond. He's all business, all the time; grim, focused on the mission, and licensed to kill or be killed. I liked Bond, but I think I liked Man From UNCLE better..because of the levity that breaks up the action. Guy Ritchie hits a home run with Man From U.N.C.L.E. and I'm already looking forward to the Sequel.",1449014400,3,849,4.448717948717949

The movie turned out way better than I expected, sort of a James Bond feel (the old James bond, not necessarily the new ones) Though my mother was not a huge fan, it's not very much like the old show, but I enjoyed it.

It should have been good.  The cast was fine.  I felt like Cavill has a bit of a challenge with playing a dynamic character, but in this case it wasn't really required.  I guess if you've got nothing better to do, go for it.  You won't want your money back, but you won't be glad you spent it either.",1448841600,,465,3.946236559139785

But for the most part it drags terribly and never builds up any momentum over its too-long 2 hours. The stiff and monotone performances from the male eye candy leads don't help -- Cavill suavely muttering all his lines, Hammer not for one second really trying to convince you he's Russian. On the up side, Vikander and Debicki rule every scene they're in. Shoulda made The Girl From UNCLE instead.",1448755200,,562,4.744897959183674

If you're insisting on this film being a perfect match of the '60s TV series...just watch those old episodes instead.  Personally I like this one much better.  The three leads are perfect and very charismatic, the plot well-written as far as spy thrillers go, the action is taut but not so serious that the flaws begin to matter, and the twists are solid but not so frequent that they overshadow the characters.  Shakespeare?  No.  Great fun and witty dialogue? Oh yeah.",1448668800,8,708,4.715447154471545

It determines whether I will watch a movie or replay it. This theme music C, original theme music from show A.

How can you go wrong with 2 such fabulous leads like Cavill and Hammer. All the casting was good. Look at Hugh Grant as British Intelligence. The plot was good. The show was entertaining.

Unfortunately, for me anyway, this movie fails to deliver, both as a remake of the original, and as a vehicle of Guy Ritchie's hip, slightly comedic timing. The plot is decent, I guess, but the pacing is slow, Henry Cavill's performance is wooden, and Alicia Vikander keeps forgetting she's supposed to have a german accent.

Yes they took some liberties with the characters, but I believe they kept the same tone, the same idea that it's a dangerous business they are in. And they gave the characters room to grow. I really really want more!  Acting, directing and filming is all first class.  Loved the music too.

It's most certainly not like when they made The Wild Wild West into a movie. Then they took something many of us loved and made a fool out of it. And by association out of us who enjoyed the slightly left of center quality the tv show had. The same happened with The Avengers movie.

7294241,4,B00ZS21J6E,"Clever film.  The acting is great, and there are enough plot turns, suspense, and action to keep it interesting pretty much all the way through.  Hugh Grant is underused, so the two leads carry the film, and they do a fine job.  The girl is excellent.  The character of Victoria is a little campy, almost a cartoon character.  The ending makes it clear that this is the beginning of a franchise, which I was glad to see.  I hope in the next installment we will see more of Hugh Grant and the same two leads, as well as the girl, who has a vulnerable Audrey Hepburn quality coupled with sass and sensuality. Guy Ritchie is an amazing director, but I felt there was just a little something missing from this film.  It's hard to put my finger on it.  Both of the Sherlock Holmes films were flawless and had perfect timing.  This film was entertaining and definitely worth the watch but needed perhaps a little more chemistry between the two leads to make us care about their partnership more.  They are each compelling on their own but need more interaction when they're together.  Aside from these issues, it's a really good film.",1448150400,,1128,4.534653465346534

7294245,3,B00ZS21J6E,"I struggled with 2 or 3 stars for this, and it finally just barely edged up to 3.

No, I didn't see Heineken presented even once in this film.  Read on, and you'll see what I mean.

Overall, this was a feature-length Heineken commercial.  The people are so shattering attractive and costumed and blocked and shot so magnificently in cool locations with cool music and cool dialog, that I was too often overwhelmed by the sheer production perfection to pay attention to the story.  Everyone was perfect, so perfect that it distracted from the narrative that all of this other stuff is supposed to be supporting.  I mean, even the bad guys, with their predictable slicked-back hair and moustaches, had awesome presented clothing, in an f***k'd-up Moods of Norway kind of way.

And the story.  When I was able to actually pay attention to the story, it was bad.  The opening sequence with the two Trabants in chase was patentl ridiculous on so many levels, if anything for their legendary lack of the horsepower of a lawn mower.  Scenes and dialogs, character actions and the story twists all didn't really make a lot of sense; eventually it became clear to me that the narrative was merely a supporting mechanism for the flawless production.  This meticulously crafted and filmed production is what got this rating from 2 to 3 stars.

Bottom line: If you like those ultra-mod Heineken commercials with cool people doing exceedingly cool things while dressed cool and being cool, with cool music playing in far-out cool places, you should freekin' love this movie.  If you're more into logical and more clearly presented cinematic spy-movie storytelling, this isn't going to work for you.",1448150400,,1685,4.890845070422535

I think with the recent Bond flicks and Bourne flicks and Ritchie's gems, Snatch and Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, we're used to faster paced action and wit.  This film's pace was a good deal slower, but it didn't make it a negative experience for me.  I think it did its namesake TV show proud.  Great soundtrack.

7294247,4,B00ZS21J6E,"The script may have been a bit convoluted but no more so than any other well received (or poorly received) Ritchie flick. The plot moves quickly and goes in several directions at once. In the seams, where the action leaves space, there's decent character development for the genre...meaning that though the characters are probably completely unrealistic, they're less unrealistic (and less cartoonish) than James Bond or any characters found in any Bond film would be...but they are still completely unrealistic and very much cartoonish...but what sort of super spies wouldn't be?

And though I'm sure there are those who'd disagree, I think Cavill's Solo is every bit as good as Vaughn's, and Hammer's Kuryakin is much more interesting than McCallum's. I also appreciated the back stories...they were amusing.

I'd watch it again, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action movies, spy films or early 60s period films. On all three levels, I can't think of anything that Man from UNCLE couldn't hold its own against. Art it ain't; fun it is.",1448150400,,1047,5.046242774566474

My biggest gripes with the movie: I didn't like the actors in their roles and they didn't seem to work well together. I have no issues with any of the actors, it just seems like inappropriate casting for the roles. Cavill seems out of place and awkward especially since his character is the least well written in this movie. Plus, I kinda hate it when they use two or more actors that look so much alike (the women) I have trouble figuring out which one is which. Also, there are too many stupid scenes like the 'snack in the truck' scene.

7294275,1,B00ZS21J6E,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

Uninspiring, outdated, boring box-office flop, re-make of an old TV show.

Another unsuccessful attempt by producers to cash in on remaking an old hit TV show into a feature film. Director Guy Ritchie has had success with period piece films like Sherlock Holmes. Yet The Man from U.N.C.L.E. based on a TV show from 1965 looks and feels like all of its fifty years, it seems out of touch. Ritchie should have taken notice of the huge success of another past TV show of fifty years ago Mission Impossible. The feature films of Mission Impossible were updated to present day and utilizes all the modern technology available today, along with having the larger younger film audience identify with the updated version.  Even spy spoofing film Austin Powers had the sense to fast forward the dated 1960s character to the present time.  The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Mission Impossible, Austin Powers and others all pay homage to James Bond 007 who started it all in the 1960s. Yet the 007 films, Mr. Bond and all the actors who played him were and are in step with the times of events that were and are happening as each James Bond film was filmed.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E. flopped at the box office not only because it was outdated. The main characters all had aloof, inflated egos and the actors were all hamming it up. There was no one to really like in this film. No real chemistry between the characters. Also the plot was so recycled from so many other films there was nothing new to offer here.  Henry Cavill in this film comes across like an 007 clone, looking somewhat like a cross between James Bond past actors; Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. In fact the film looks like a long screen test for Cavill to fill 007 shoes next.  With Daniel Craig aging gracefully it is possible that Cavill will get the nod to step into Mr. Bonds shoes next. Since Cavill has the most important credential, he is British. Most important requirement for any actor to be considered for the 007 role.
If by chance a sequel is considered for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. I would suggest that the film makers of the film place the characters in the present day, like James Bond and Mission Impossible films have done with much success. Perhaps have Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin chase a criminal master mind VIA through a time machine thus putting them where they will have much more success in the present time.",1448064000,2,2410,4.619158878504673

I found these weakness too great to overcome and ended up with a so what attitude at the end of the film. A flat uninspired reboot attempt that misses the mark.

All three actors are beautiful to look at; the script delivers nicely nuanced sexual tension; we enjoy witty repartee with nary an F-bomb; we gawk at wonderful locations; the Cold War is evoked with music, clothing, cars and spies. There is plenty of action which features gunfire, speed boats, motorcycles, a dune buggy, various trucksand just a bit of highly satisfying blowie uppie stuff. Oh! And watch the stunt driving!

Directed and co-written (with six other collaborators) by Guy Ritchie (""Sherlock Holmes"") this reboot of the classic television series has us laughing from the first high-energy scene that opens the movie, to the final one which I won't describe.

It was all action and suave straight from the beginning, you would think that it was a cut out of James Bond (I later found out Ian Fleming actually helped conceptualize the characters).

This is basically a story of two very different agents: CIA Agent Napoleon Solo who has a penchant for smart suits and expensive food, and KGB super spy Ilya Kuryakin; both of whom have to reluctantly work together to save the world. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer do a great job playing the agents and Alicia Vikander who's more known for her period roles, also did decently well as the ""not so damsel in distress"". The dialogue is witty, smart and coincides with the action and context perfectly. I will admit as the movie went on, I kind of went into the Team Ilya camp - who would have thought a Russian accent could sound sexy?

So, if you like Kingsman, this is the movie for you. It may seem like it was cookie-cut out of James Bond, but the story arc does enough to be original and true to itself. I'd say watch it and enjoy it.",1447718400,11,1141,4.3023255813953485

So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.

Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Especially if you like James Bond movies.",1447545600,3,1215,4.803827751196172
7294386,3,B00ZS21J6E,"The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was a popular TV series that ran from 1964 to 1968 and was inspired by the popularity of the James Bond films. In fact, Ian Fleming, the author of the Bond novels, is the individual credited with giving the shows central character Napoleon Solo  his name.

The feature film takes place in the early 60s at the height of the Cold War. An opening sequence finds American spy Solo (Henry Cavill, Man of Steel) trying to avoid being killed by top Soviet agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer, The Social Contract) as an elaborately staged chase gives way to a daring escape from East to West Berlin. But it soon comes to light that a former Nazi has kidnapped a German scientist and is well on his way to creating a nuclear bomb. Both America and the Soviet Union cannot allow this to happen and decide to pool their top agents  Solo and Kuryakin to seek out the bad guys and thwart their nefarious plans.

The original TV series was a clever weekly excursion into the world of spies, femme fatales, and maniacal villains bent on world domination. It was fun to see how Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Kuryakin (David McCallum) joined forces to combat and prevail over these villains. The new picture, however, suffers from two very stiff leads who have movie star looks but who lack that twinkle that makes the lighter moments of the film sparkle. Hammer works hard to convince with his Russian accent and Cavill attempts to look calm and in charge under even the most dire circumstances, but the script by director Guy Ritchie and Lionel Wigram never comes to full life. Having been a huge fan of the original TV series, I was disappointed with this movie.

The plot is really a lead-up to how the organization named U.N.C.L.E.  United Network Command for Law and Enforcement  came about. The film is distinguished more by its production design than its script. Vintage era cars, clothes, and props are meticulously correct, lending a terrific period feel to the proceedings. Alicia Vikander co-stars as a young woman with clandestine loyalties, and Elizabeth Debicki exudes pure villainy as beautiful Victoria, whose soft spoken patrician manner veils a cold-blooded murderess. Hugh Grant pops up as Waverly, Solos boss whos on hand mostly to provide exposition and keep the audience up to speed.

Rated PG-13, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is a good film that could have been far better with added wit and more expressive actors who understand how to deliver comic lines. As it stands, it has lots of action which is unfortunately sandwiched between overly talky scenes. The movie opens the door for potential sequels, which is practically de rigueur in action pictures these days.

The way they used the music and subtitles was very artful. The clothes and scenery were gorgeous. The action scenes were tasteful and not overdone.

7294433,5,B00ZS21J6E,"I went to see this movie twice in the theater, once with my best friend, once with my parents and grandmother, and we all loved it.

Overall very well written. The characters were fantastic, especially (for me) Armie Hammer's Illya. Alicia Vikander did an excellent job as spitfire Gaby, who is one of my favorite female characters, who, to my relief, was not relegated to love-interest-who-does-nothing-but-need-rescuing. Some people took issue with Henry Cavill's character, Napoleon, and the way he spoke, but didn't have a problem with it as it fit the movie well.

For once, the romance was subtle and not at all forced, than goodness. Forced romance is something that happens with a lot of movies these days (I'm looking at you, Age of Ultron).

The action was excellent and realistic, the characters were believable, and there were some genuinely funny moments. There was a refreshing lack of cliches and archetypes as well, which thrilled me. They even kept the language, sex, and violence to a minimum, especially considering the type of movie it is, so you can probably watch it with the kids (but you can judge that for yourself). I definitely, highly recommend this movie.

Is it the best movie ever made? No. But It is one I will definitely watch many times.",1446854400,3,1271,4.87037037037037

7294437,5,B00ZS21J6E,"So wonderful!  I laughed and laughed and it was all so visually gorgeous - the sets, the clothes, the hair, the make-up, the cast...  All just perfect. This is a movie that doesn't take itself overly seriously (like Bonds or MIs) and is wittily funny and exciting.  Doesn't get caught up in overly complicated drama to delude the audience into thinking it's clever.  Develops interesting and fun characters that are incredibly endearing. I completely fell in love with Ilya played by Armie Hammer - so charmingly acted!  And no one could more perfectly embody the sound and look of the time than Henry Cavill as Solo - the way he pronounced Nazi and his vocal prosody!  While Alicia Vikander has such star quality and loads of classic Hollywood moxie.  And her character Gabby (who has the most fabulous wardrobe) is a great inclusion to the UNCLE universe.  Loved Hugh Grant's character - small part but he steals his scenes with great dialogue so amusingly delivered.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed him more!  Basically, GREAT cast.  Also, wonderful direction - liked the incorporation of retro shots and transitions.  Conclusion, watch this film.

Such an undervalued/unknown gem. I honestly think people didn't know what they were missing!  I've seen film reviews that said it was stupid or cheesy, but I don't think it crosses the line into cheesy, though it comes adorably close.  This is actually a very clever film with charmingly dry dialogue and great characters. Anything so funny requires loads of intelligence - particularly when so much of the humor is based on character relations and is very tongue and cheek, recognizing the stereotypes and silliness of the day and incorporating them in a way that allows us to laugh at the ridiculousness (all the overlapping, conflicting, selfish agendas), yet in a nice way.  It's just simple, pure, golden fun.  I think the main popularity problem is that it was under advertised - people didn't know what it was.  Another contributing factor is probably that the humor style is in more of an English style than American - aka, it doesn't have to stoop to being crass, loud, gross, or raunchy.  If you can't appreciate this film's humor, it's just a sad loss to you.

Anyways, this film is great!  Do give it a try - everyone I've talked to that saw it at least enjoyed it and most loved it.  I hope they make a sequel, but just as its single self, it is exquisite - and I'm so glad they made it.  You know how people didn't get The Princess Bride when it was in theaters yet it became huge when it came out on video and word of mouth spread?  This is a movie with that same quality of misunderstood, under recognized greatness.  Hopefully the word of mouth spreads so people can enjoy it. Because it really is just joyful!",1446854400,8,2780,4.694214876033058

Three main stars are interesting together.  I'll watch the next installment since it does seem to be set up as a franchise.
Don't like Hugh Grant, in general, but I like him in this.

The movie was a bit uneven.  I don't know if this is because the director isn't top notch or the editor was on dope.

This is not your ""superhero"" spy movie, the characters are believable, likable and subject to some very human failings. This makes the story more enjoyable since it doesn't devolve into fantasy. Henry Cavill makes a better Napoleon Solo than Superman but Arnie Hammer really shines as his KGB counterpart Ilya Kuriakin, removing the bad taste that the Lone Ranger left in many mouths (through no fault of his own, however). Alicia Vikander rounds out the team and carries her role very well despite the presence of Hammer and Cavill. This was a fun ride and seems shorted than it's running time, a good indicator of it's entertainment value. We will watch this again and look forward to additional movies in the series as the chemistry is very good for a first movie together.",1446681600,16,893,4.805194805194805

7294454,1,B00ZS21J6E,"Growing up in the US Northeast  as a 12 year old male during the (pre-LARP) 1970s I happily role-played The Man from U.N.C.L.E. with a friend down the street using  hand-written passport documents and homemade spy gear cut from plywood scraps. My neighbor was Napoleon Solo, and I was Illya Kuryakin. So naturally I had to watch this re-baked movie version of the series no matter how banal the reviews said it was. In fact I wanted to get my slice of it so fast I did not even wait for the Amazon streaming price to drop, I just bit down hard at 14 dollars. And I am so sorry to report, especially to other Kuryakin fans, that this Man from U.N.C.L.E. is INDEED a flavorless flop and actually BORING (that must have been hard work turing frivolous but fun low culture into leaden dull no-culture: I wonder what they get paid to do that kind of reverse alchemy anyway?). But hey, by contrast the film's 2.20 minute preview pretty much offers up every worthwhile bit of plot, laugh or slice of action that is shown in the actual film in between the longueurs that fill up 90% of this confection, and its for free. Which is to say, you can still get your boomer generation fix by watching the trailer without having to take out either your secret ID or your wallet.

7294458,4,B00ZS21J6E,"I have not seen the original series from the 60's on which the film is supposedly based on and after which the film takes its name, but Guy Ritchie seldom makes ""bad"" movies.  The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) is a spy-action-comedy, something along the lines of James Bond.  The film is set in the mid 1960's and it takes place in East Germany (scenes filmed in England) and Italy.  The two main characters are a CIA agent (aka Napoleon Solo) and a KGB agent (aka Illya Kuryakin) --- an English actor Henry Cavill plays the American agent, while an American actor Armie Hammer plays the Russian agent, with a distinctive/improvised Russian accent.  The two men are enemies at the beginning of the film...however, they soon will have to put their differences aside and come together in order to 'save the world' from a rouge group that is in the process of obtaining a new and powerful atomic bomb.  Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Almost, every James Bond film has similar plot.  Nonetheless, what stands out from the clich story-line are the: 1) soundtrack 2) good acting 3) likeable/good looking characters 4) beautiful shooting locations 5) and the chic 60's fashion style, which has been very well presented in the film--- all these attributes contributed to the 5-STAR rating.

If you enjoyed watching The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015), and would like to see similar movies, I recommend watching: Agent 077: Mission Bloody Mary (1967),  Agent 077: From the Orient with Fury (1965) both with Ken Clark...also, Black Tight Killers (1966), 0SS 117: Cairo: Nest of Spies and 0SS 117: Lost in Rio.",1446508800,,1588,4.855555555555555

I can remember watching the Saint, Our Man Flint, and of course the classic Bond films.  I can see where this may not have done as well as expected in the theaters.  People may not have gotten it ... their loss.
the acting was great and Henry Cavill got the clipped  accent and dialog that marked the previously mention movies. The costuming was true and fun, we laughed at how the Soviet Tech was portrayed ( and kicked the US's butt).  the action was fast paced and represented in the montage style.

7294493,3,B00ZS21J6E,"The first one-third of the movie is interestingly unpredictable. For example, in the car-chase scene at the beginning, when one of the cars gets stuck between the walls, I ask myself: What are they going to do? The solution is hilarious.

The subtle humor is entertaining but it's not as novelty and intriguing as Kingsman: The Secret Service

The special effects are below par.

The last second-third of the film is predictable as the majority of other films of the same genre.

 According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are its financial figures:

Release Date: August 14, 2015
Production Budget: $75 million
Domestic:  $45,445,109
Foreign:  $55,100,000
Worldwide:  $100,545,109

So, in North America, it has lost around 29 million dollars. However, worldwide,  it has taken in 25.5 million dollars more than its production cost. Thats not a lot but still good. It shows the American audience do not like it as much as the audience overseas.

7294539,5,B00ZS21J6E,"As a devoted fan of the original series, I was highly skeptical about a Man From U.N.C.L.E. movie. What were the odds Hollywood would capture the spirit of the original? Vs the chance they'd mock, corrupt, and destroy? In my case these fears were unfounded. Guy Ritchie produced a terrific romp with all the romantic idealism of U.N.C.L.E. organization and original show. Great acting, fantastic score, incredible style, and the idealism of U.N.C.L.E firmly present at the heart. Plus it's hilarious.

That said, there are a few issues that might be viewed as problems. First, it's not a blood-spurting, bomb exploding action flick, which has left some people confused about genre. Second, it's a prequel, set before the founding of U.N.C.L.E. ...so there's not actually any U.N.C.L.E. (a sore point for some fans). Cavill's American accent is a little hard to understand (but worth a close listen). The YELLOW SUBTITLES are (imo) highly distracting. And the NAZI side plot (not a subplot exactly) bogs down slightly.

Despite the issues, this is a truly outstanding movie with a fantastic script and actual production values (rather than buckets of CGI). Watch it twice. Watch it three times! You'll like it better every time and be glad you did. :)",1445904000,,1250,5.033816425120773

Not to mention the gorgeous production design and great scoreIve been playing the soundtrack on my drive to work since I saw this in theaters. Also, despite being an action movie with two male leads, this movie really came through with female characters. Gaby is an action hero with a solid character arc of her own, and the villain is a badass woman with her own agendanot something you see in most films in this genre.

As an original U.N.C.L.E. agent of the '60s, I didn't know what to expect from the movie, other than the promise that it would be 'true' to the original series. What I did not expect and was thoroughly thrilled by, was that this is considered a prequel to the original. I thoroughly loved the concept of how Solo and Illya got together, and no, it was not pretty! Nuff said.

Some people complained he wasn't the same as the original, but an event that takes place at the end demonstrates how the two would eventually become.

It's quite simply the most fun I've had at the movies in ages. In recent years I've seen plenty of summer blockbusters, until my eyes and brain glaze over at one more improbable stunt, one more ""outrun the fireball"" and shallow quips passing for dialogue. ""U.N.C.L.E"" is a throwback to the '60s in all the best ways, adult but not graphic, unendingly stylish but with real heart and some genuinely tender moments, and with a soundtrack that defies expectations by NOT incorporating the original TV theme but which is perfectly attuned to the mood of each scene and impeccably performed by brilliant instrumentalists. The cast is sheer perfection, with chemistry to spare, the women fully equal to the men without revisionism, and it sets up the sequel potential in final credits that require real attention and continue the film's dry wit, which isn't for everyone but which certainly had people laughing out loud at every screening I attended.",1443225600,5,1133,4.845360824742268

7294550,4,B00ZS21J6E,"The release of this movie has been disheartening. The warm reception just wasn't there and I can't figure out why. I have to wonder if maybe it just wasn't marketed properly.

Sure, Henry Cavill's American ""accent"" is noticeable--but it's not detracting in the way American actors do British accents.

The film has a great ensemble and the trio have fantastic chemistry together.

The story itself leaves something to be desired (it's a basic ""save the world from a nuclear bomb"" tale), but the style and comedy overpower it completely. This is also one of those films where the soundtrack was expertly applied and enhances the experience.

By the end--which is clearly set up for a sequel--you are left wanting more. Unfortunately, the box office results for such a big budget film--even with the great reviews it received--make it HIGHLY unlikely.

I'm not one to buy movies anymore, but this was one I told myself I had to get when it is released. I would love to have it in my collection! Enjoy!",1442620800,10,999,4.784883720930233

7294552,5,B00ZS21J6E,"This movie is different from all the others - it plays in its own space, not trying to compete with Mission Impossible, or James Bond, but rather taking on that same tongue in cheek tone that made Kingsmen such a hit.  There is nothing totally over the top, like hanging from a jet, for example, and the movie relies on an engaging cast, well-written dialog, charm and wit.  And yes, there is action for sure!

Basic setting is the 1960's, Cold War, but the Russian and the American have to work together to avert disaster.  This is a source of conflict, one-upmanship, and ultimately a friendship develops out of trying to prove to each other they are the better man.  All the while, Gaby, played by the gorgeous and talented Alicia Vikander, contributes a dynamite 3rd person - the show certainly wouldn't be the same without her.

Henry Cavill plays Solo, and this is finally a role that completely suits him, both physically and mentally, and gives him a chance to really show his charm.  Armie Hammer is fantastic as well, playing the stoic Russian.  Directed by Guy Ritchie, and he really did an excellent job creating an environment for everyone to do their best work.  I loved how well everyone worked together, and there was great chemistry between everyone, not just a single pair.

Do not go into this thinking you are seeing something completely serious.  If you have seen the original TV shows, you'll know that this was intended to be a witty show that really made fun of all the spy genre, and they really honored that in this movie.",1442448000,86,1548,4.633699633699634
7294553,4,B00ZS21J6E,"I have only vague recollections of the original, but this matches closely enough for remake purposes. And, like any good remake, adds a fair bit of its own to the classic characters. Napoleon Solo, for example, seems closer to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/early-James-Bond/dp/B00004RG62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">early James Bond</a>&nbsp;in his taste for the finer things - a taste he supplies somewhat beyond a civil servants nominal income. Ilya Kuryakin comes across a good bit more gritty and less sane than I recall. All of which just amps up the personality clashes, and gives room for some Bond-like humor - as if the throwback 1960s fashions weren't smirk-worthy already.

Then there's all the action and running around you might expect. But this isn't the 1960s any more. Half a century later, things have changed. In particular, the spy flick genre isn't a men's club any more, even if the modern movie portays a Cold War script. Alicia Vikander's character adds balance. And in the inevitable sequel-bait at the end, makes us look forward to the next installment.

7294556,3,B00ZS21J6E,"With Mission: Impossible- Rogue Nation, Kingsman: The Secret Service, and the upcoming James Bond film Spectre, 2015 is already lousy with spy movies. Does anybody really need another one? Much less another remake of a 1960s TV series that is remembered fondly because of its offbeat tone? Turns out the answer is a resounding ""yes"", we definitely need one more if it's the super-cool The Man from U.N.C.L.E, a suave piece of summer fun full of sweet gadgets, international espionage, and the real emergence of Henry Cavill as a bonafide leading man.

Sure, Cavill has already earned big bucks by flying around as Superman but that's a role which requires a certain level of restraint. Superman doesn't do charming. Cavill, it turns out, is incredibly magnetic when given the opportunity, and director Guy Ritchie affords him plenty of that in the role of American spy, Napoleon Solo. A small-time crook and con artist forced into government service at the height of the Cold War with Russian, Solo's greatest weapon is a smile that could melt the cold heart of any Russkie. His task is to safely extract Gaby Teller (the ubiquitous Alicia Vikander), the daughter of an East German nuclear scientist, out of East Berlin. The fear is that her father is helping to build a nuke for evil-doing socialites Alexander (Luca Calvani) and Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki). Also afraid of the world going boom are the Russians, who send stone-faced operative Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) to join in on the mission to stop them.

Of course both governments have their own agendas which include killing the other if they get in the way. Those parameters are put to the test immediately in the film's most thrilling action sequence in which the vaguely superhuman Kuryakin pursues on foot a fleeing Gaby and Solo as they speed off. It's the kind of bombastic set piece that Ritchie thrives at, but this amounts to really the only scene where he gets to show that off. For the most part he's unexpectedly restrained, focusing his energy on comic mood rather than explosions, or better yet, comedy in the midst of extreme violence. It's something he's always relished in, look at his Sherlock Holmes movies for example, and he remains committed to making this a purely fun spy movie.

Part of keeping the tone light in the face of nuclear devastation involves some friendly macho sparring between Solo and Kuryakin, with each guy looking to prove, in any way possible, that he's the superior man. Sometimes that involves a brief but destructive tussle, which Solo will come away from grinning while Kuryakin maintains his grim-faced stare. Surprisingly, they aren't really at odds over who will win Gaby's heart. There's no real love triangle here, although she and Kuryakin share a flirtation that threatens to pierce his armor. By necessity Hammer's role is less dimensional than the others, while Vikander creates a wonderfully colorful character out of Gaby. She proves to be as mentally and physically tough as her male counterparts, yet still is spirited enough to literally dance circles around them.

Problems arise when Ritchie needs to flip the switch and take the finale into serious mode. As the stakes are raised, people start dying, and the world is on the brink of nuclear disaster, it's hard to treat it with the necessary gravity. In one critical scene, Solo literally takes a sandwich break while Kuryakin is running for his life. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. often times looks like an ad for a fashion magazine, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's ultimately a silly and weightless film, too, but you'll be too distracted by how beautiful everyone is to care.",1441584000,7,3674,4.949756888168557

Very glad I picked this one.  Don't understand why it wasn't at the top of the box office.  Action packed, good acting- a good, clean movie.

7294558,4,B00ZS21J6E,"This movie is based on the 1960s TV series of the same name.

It features the same principal protagonists: American Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Russian Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who are brought together as unlikely partners to fight evil- in this case, a clandestine group which is trying to procure a nuclear bomb.

The film is set in the early 1960s, in the midst of the Cold War, making Kuryakin and Solo unlikely allies- their rivalry sets the story going. Compared with the TV version, the characters portrayed are more complex, and have their share of flaws.

Director and co-writer Guy Ritchie brings his trademark style brand of movie making and story telling, resulting in a film which offers a great deal of 1960s style (carefully recreated), an entertaining (and sometimes violent) tale and gorgeous Italian scenery.

The story is carefully crafted to include several plot twists to keep you guessing, and with an element of good humor. However, there is no element of sending up the characters or the situation.

Incidentally, look out for the scene when the original ""Man from UNCLE"" theme is playing on a car radio...

This movie is a pleasantly entertaining way to spend a couple of hours- I doubt you would be disappointed after watching it.",1441411200,8,1267,4.924882629107981
7294559,5,B00ZS21J6E,"Let me preface this by saying that I had heard from the Man from U.N.C.L.E. before but I never watched the old series, so this is not from the point of view of someone who is devoted/knowledgeable/ever even watched the original.
I LOVED this movie.  I thought it was fun, well paced, really funny and charming.  Henry Cavill was awesome as Solo.  He played the confident and unflappable angle perfectly.  I thought he was charming, not to mention so handsome it's almost unbelievable.  I was also pretty surprised by how much I liked Armie Hammer as Illya.  He surprised me a little in this, I thought he was very believable and likable.  I liked the casts chemistry, I liked Guy Ritchie's direction, I loved the humor.  It isn't the deepest film you'll see all year, but it was surprising and FUN.",1441238400,3,798,4.609929078014185
7294560,5,B00ZS21J6E,"You must see this movie, its really a pleasure! If you like good humor combined with soft action this is it. I was not familiar with both men main actors: Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer and I thought at first that they are a bit dull. But hey, they developed their characters so well during the movie that I became a fan till the end. Especially Armie Hammer as Illya played a very convincing role. The men duet was so well-built that you should find a very entertaining plot. Its not too aggressive, not too heavy in special effects; its more of a consistent middle type of action movie centered on convincing characters. Elisabeth Debicki aka Victoria comes next with great acting. The Gaby character could have been better but maybe that was the idea, to let men shine this time. The powerful woman archetype comes undoubtedly through Victoria, Gaby goes more as the girl next door prototype. About Hugh Grant, I am a fan of him, but you should not expect too much around him in this movie. Yes he is funny but his character is weak and too secondary for my taste; as a good addition however its ok.

All in all its a great weekend movie, with friends, even family without anything too offensive or aggressive to watch.  It succeeds to capture the entire lengths and give you a good mood all way around. I was very pleased and I recommend it for relaxing and easy but inspired fun purposes.",1441152000,4,1392,4.4980237154150196
7294561,5,B00ZS21J6E,"I really didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. Although I know it was a hugely popular tv series in the early 1960s (and spawned an entire generation of spy shows), I have never seen an episode of the original tv series. I did know that the movie starred Henry Cavill (Superman in Man of Steel) and Armie Hammer (The Social Network and The Lone Ranger in The Lone Ranger) and that its really more of an origins story and not a full blown adaptation of the tv series. With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and consider it one of the best films Ive seen in 2015.

The opening sequence where Napoleon Solo (Hammer) rescues a female mechanic named Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) from East Berlin with Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) giving chase sets the tone for the rest of the film: the style, the witty banter, the action-scenes that movie at just the right pace (they don't movie so fast that you cant see whats going on). Shortly after this intro, Solo and Kuryakin are forced to join together by their superiors to stop an international threat (a leftover faction of Nazi German) that could destroy both the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. Gaby joins the mix because her father has been kidnapped and is being forced against his will to work on a nuclear weapon. Their assignment is to find and locate Gabbys father and stop the weapon from being completed.

The movie was directed by Guy Ritchie and while Im not his biggest fan, the Guy Ritchie type of filmmaking (split scenes, unusual placement of camera for certain shots, etc.) is all over the film and for this movie, that style works really well. For instance, theres one scene where Solo and Kuryakin are breaking into a vault and the positioning of the camera for the shot makes the scene so much more interesting.

Another thing I really liked about the movie was the soundtrack. The score has a great 1960s vibe to it, while at the same time keeping the tempo up and supporting what is taking place on the screen without overshadowing it.

Personally, I think the reason I enjoyed THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. so much is that it was fun. The movie is a spy thriller, but its not as serious as some of the James Bond stuff has become (I learned recently that Ian Fleming actually helped with the creation of the original tv series) and its not as campy or spoofy as something like GET SMART. Instead, the movie reaches a nice balance between the two. Theres just the right level of action and humor without going over the top. The action and drama never take themselves too seriously and the humor is never so irrelevant or nonsensical to be campy.

I do think that some fans of the original tv series might be disappointed by THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. movie. Other than character names and the overall general concept, the movie really doesnt have anything to do with the original tv show; its an origin story and not an adaptation. The movie doesnt even use the original theme song at all. So, I can understand how fans of the original show might be disappointed by the movie.

Still, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is one of the best movies Ive seen in 2015 and I really hope the movie does well enough so that a sequel can be made and we can see more adventures with Cavill and Hammer. Highly recommended.",1441152000,11,3289,4.500837520938023
7294562,5,B00ZS21J6E,One of the best movies of the year! I highly recommend it!,1441152000,,58,3.9166666666666665
7294563,5,B00ZS21J6E,"First, I have always been a big U.N.C.L.E. fan all my life from the very first episode which was aired on September 21, 1964.  I was only 9 years old at the time but ""the man from U.N.C.L.E"" left a lifelong impression on me.  It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement.  I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today!

So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie: If one is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed!  Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.

However, for all the fans that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat!  The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960s and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; we all know who is behind this!

The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie!  You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem!  For hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans your will get to see our beloved U.N.C.L.E Carbine Special faithfully reproduced make an appearance in several of the big battle scenes near the end of the movie!

Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller!  With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!

It has everything you need for a great movie, and it just has what you need to enjoy a wonderful film. They portrayed the 60s perfectly while being careful to pay attention to the details like wardrobe and vernacular used at that time in history. The onscreen chemistry between the actors was superb! These people really put some of their best work into their portrayal of these characters. As for the plot, I enjoyed that too. It sets this above the spy genre into its own special slot. Don't get me wrong, I like high action, suspenseful movies as much as the next fanatic, but sometimes its nice to see a movie with believable action and realistic stunts. (Plus, I think that actors who do most of their own stunts make a film that much better for the effort they put into it) And its not like this movie is lacking in either suspense or action, but subtlety is an undervalued art that this director has masterfully captured. I went to see this movie no less than five times, and I discovered something new during each viewing!
All that being said, I did not see the original show that this is based on beforehand so I went with no prior expectations. If you have seen the show, this movie is very different while still keeping true to the things that made the original so endearing.",1440892800,16,1388,4.468503937007874

7294569,4,B00ZS21J6E,"Theatrical review. Warner Bros., like just about every other studio, digs back into the TV vaults and resurrects a popular series from the 1960's. Directed and co-written by Guy Ritchie (""Sherlock Holmes""), the film even maintains and early `60's Cold War setting. Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill, ""Man of Steel"") is an American CIA agent and a former safe cracker and thief. In exchange for some prison time, Solo is kept on a short leach by Sanders (Jared Harris), his handler. Armie Hammer (""The Social Network"") plays Russian KGB agent Illya Kuryakin, who is physically a long way away from his slight TV counterpart, David McCallum.

After a fun opening sequence featuring Solo helping an East German auto mechanic named Gaby (Alicia Vikander, ""Seventh Son"") escape to the West, with Kuryakin in hot pursuit, the film slows down a bit so the audience can collect their bearings. In spite of their Cold War animosity, both sides are concerned that remnants of Nazi Germany are close to acquiring an atomic bomb and are using Gaby's estranged father to put on the final touches.

The film has some whiz-bang action sequences and some terrific stunts, but suffers a bit by comparison to the recent ""Mission: Impossible"" film. The pacing seems a bit erratic. Don't get me wrong, the movie is a lot of fun and if anything has numerous funny exchanges between Solo and Kuryakin with Gaby often playing the straight man...err woman. Ms. Vikander, following up on her terrific performance in this year's ""Ex Machina,"" looks to become an ""A"" list superstar. She shows a keen sense of humor here to go along with her dramatic chops. Unfortunately she's not the film's focus.

""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."", courtesy of Director Guy Ritchie, resurrects the Cold War and the original tongue in cheek spy thriller. It features Henry Cavill as Napoleon Solo, suave CIA agent and art thief, and Armie Hammer as Illya Kuryakin, burly KGB spy and thug, along with Alicia Vikander as Gaby, an East German woman who partners with them. After a fantastic opening action sequence that introduces Solo and Illya as unlikely partners, the two are directed to retrieve an illicit nuclear weapon from an Italian crime family. The location shooting in Italy is wonderful, the action sequences are very decent, and there is lots of sly humor.  A sequence in which Solo nonchalantly enjoys a stolen lunch while Kuryakin dodges a few bad guys is priceless.  If the storyline is not exceptional, it is certainly entertaining.

7294574,1,B00ZS21J6E,"This film is one of those blatant attempts to draw in an audience by leveraging an old name for what is in fact an entirely new film. Its also one of those films where its clear that those responsible hold the original material in total contempt. Honestly, the film is more of a homage to the 1980s film ""Red Heat"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger/'James Belushi as russian/american buddy cops) than the man from UNCLE.

For any with memories of the old show, all that is really used here is a few old names. What you have here is a film about nazis and nuclear weapons where the whole point of the thing is exposition explaining the inevitable team-up of the two lead characters. There is also the familiar hackwork attempt at giving the lead characters psychological depth through negative character traits. As per the old hack formula, they are two lone wolves who fight each other and then decide to become partners. The film almost drowns in its own writing cliches.

Mission Impossible proved that the name of an old show could be leveraged for something entirely new. But where Mission Impossible went in the direction of all-out action, UNCLE tried to make it about characters, backstory and 1960s nostalgia. A rather toxic mix that was never going to work. The design work is good. Some of the direction is ok, but there is lots of self-indulgent moments and attempts at humor that fail.

As far as the actors go,  Henry Cavill doesn't have the natural charisma necessary for the role. He would actually have perhaps done better as  Illya Kuryakin. I've never quite understood why people keep trying to cast Armie Hammer as an action lead.

Its not ""man from UNCLE"". Its not a great action film. Its not an original film in terms of its ideas. But it works at the level of a ""B"" action film",1440460800,7,1789,4.62776025236593

There's no hint of that here.  This is a spy movie worthy of the name, complete with double crosses, hidden agendas, incredible chase scenes, and enough clever surprises for three movies.  The TV characters of Napoleon Solo and Illya Nickovitch Kuryakin have been updated with back stories that, while just barely scratched in this movie, give both characters greater depth than they ever had in the TV show.  After I got over the shock of seeing Henry Cavill (who also plays a muscular Superman) portraying a (sort of) reformed art thief without athletic pretensions, I thoroughly enjoyed the interplay between the two.  While not a ""buddy movie"", it rather flirted with the genre.

Sadly, this is not a family movie, though it could have been.  The film is rated PG-13, and it deserves the rating -- but just barely.  Cut a couple of unnecessary scenes out, and this movie could have been rated PG for violence only.  But if everyone in the room is an adult, then this is an entertaining, smart movie with enough unexpected laughs that the parents can relax while the children are asleep in their room.
