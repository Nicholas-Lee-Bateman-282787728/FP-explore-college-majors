8693164,5,B00QW8RQGU,"This is a very nice documentary about Frederic Chopin. Not much new in information, but if you play the piano there are many clips of Martha Argerich, Daniel Barenboim, Vladamir Ashkenazy and Garrick Ohlssohn. Chopin and George Sand even ""come alive"" with special effects telling their story which was really neat and different while Chopin's music is playing throughout. Might be boring to some if you don't love Chopin. I have adored Chopin my whole life and loved it. Was lucky to get it while was on sale for $5.99. I see it has gone back up in price. Will watch repeatedly!",1492992000,,578,4.676470588235294
