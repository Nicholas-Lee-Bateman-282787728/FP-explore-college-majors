2246280,5,B0007WFY02,"I just got this DVD and it is HOT!  This DVD is by far the best of all the mixtapes out there.  I had never seen most of the footage and man this sh*t was dope.  It had mad high school footage of like 50 NBA all stars, and not just dunks.  I've seen all the AND1 and Ball Above All joints, but I think this one is better than any of those.  The music is way better too.  Go peep this DVD.",1116374400,,388,3.6144578313253013

Do I send them back and receive my money back",1356825600,,133,4.153846153846154
8052611,1,B0007WFY02,"Bought this for our son as a Christmas gift. Expected just highlights of pro athletes as stated. Very disappointed in the music playing during highlights. The first song talks about finding someone because he's not going home alone tonight. The other songs aren't any better talking about porn, whores, and oral sex before I turned off the sound completely!  There is also some swearing. So glad I did not purchase the other volumes!
Why can't people make clean music and movies? So frustrating!",1356393600,10,495,4.963855421686747
8052612,5,B0007WFY02,its for the long train rides to work better than to watch something that is of interest than sleep during the ride to work.,1330473600,,123,4.166666666666667
8052613,1,B0007WFY02,"It does feature stars but one does not get an insightful explanation of how they truly rose in the field of basketball.  If you're looking for an MTV special using spectacular basketball video clips mostly dunk shots of high school kids (now famous) of a decade ago, this is the right thing.  I was looking for a documentary to show what their formula to success was and it isn't.",1145664000,5,380,4.492753623188406
8052614,4,B0007WFY02,"One Love was a cool video.  I enjoyed trying to figure out who all the players were without watching the Special Features.  Oh yeah, these guys were sick long before they got to the League!  It's definitely worth buying.",1124582400,,220,4.589743589743589
8052615,5,B0007WFY02,"Not sure where to start. This was the first DVD of it's kind I have bought and will probably remain the best. There is constant talk about creating an age limit for players entering the league. However if the players are performing and entertaining like this then as a fan all I can say is let them play!!!!

I have read about the t.v. coverage of highschool games but have never seen it before, it is brilliant to watch.

One down side it is not long enough!!!

Call me greedy but I wanted more!!!",1121817600,,498,4.276595744680851
8052616,5,B0007WFY02,"I got all the and 1 mixes but this tape blew me away! the Kobe v. Lester Earl dunk contest is un f***in believable!  Its worth it just for that.  And the music- specially Apathy and Tribecca. Saw it in Dime and picked it up next day.  2 questions:  First where is Lester Earl today?  Next, Juanny was crazy in school, what happened to him?

Like I said, I got them all and this one is the best.  5 *****",1119225600,,403,3.9625
