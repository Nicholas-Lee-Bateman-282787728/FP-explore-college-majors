2581790,5,B000FQIRY0,"Maybe it's a nostalgia trip but I've been waiting for these series to be released on DVD for a long time. In the 70's and 80's these multi-part adaptations used to be shown on TV here in the UK on a Sunday afternoon, around tea-time as we say, and as soon as VCR's became affordable I would record these and watch them again and again. For some reason I can't remember, I didn't manage to get all of Dombey & Son so this DVD release is a special moment for me - indeed 20 years since I've seen the whole series. No big budget, no CGI, just the pinnacle of quality for acting, screenplay and production values; don't hesitate to buy if you like Victorian literature. PS, also recommended, Bleak House, Jane Eyre, Pickwick Papers, The Brontes of Haworth, Tennant of Wildfell Hall, etc.",1169856000,38,783,4.444444444444445
2581791,4,B000FQIRY0,"""Dombey and Son"" is about a relationship between a father and a daughter. Mr. Dombey has predestined his son to become his coworker in his business. Over the years, Mr. Dombey's son gets all the attention and his daughter (Florence) gets none. This is very intriguing story about relationships and how they can be either broken or sustained. One small draw back from the film is the character of Mr. Dombey. I have not read the book, so I don't know if the book is equally vague sometimes on the character's past and motives. While watching the film, I really enjoyed the wonderful acting and the cinematography which really enhanced the sub-dialogue in Dickens tale.",1167696000,12,667,4.808695652173913
2581792,4,B000FQIRY0,"In some ways, ""Dombey and Son"" is Dickens' saddest novel. It's a story about a father who, through his infatuation with his own image, irrevocably loses both his children, and then realizes too late the value of what he has lost.

Around such a wrenching theme Dickens wrote a remarkably buoyant and lively story, with sharp contrasts of darkness and brightness, piquant characterizations (and caricatures) and humor. I'd been wishing and hoping that there was a dramatization of this novel out there, and was delighted to find this version.

**SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW**

In 10 episodes, this production unfurls the story with great faithfulness to the book. When one has read the novel beforehand, one pictures characters and scenes, and it sometimes is tough for a production to live up to one's expectations. However, as I waited for favorite characters to appear, I was again and again exclaiming, ""He's wonderful!"" (of Captain Cuttle) or ""She's marvelous!"" (of Mrs. Pipchin.) It was like opening a Christmas present and finding something you wished for. They looked exactly as I'd pictured them, both in looks and manner--not a bit watered-down, nor smoothed out as Hollywood productions often make them.

It's difficult to warm to Mr. Dombey as a character, so I can't hold it against Julian Glover that he comes across as stiff and dry. He does an excellent job of conveying a sort of dormant animosity toward his hapless daughter, Florence, which makes its occasional expression all the more jarring (as when he refers to his son Paul as his ""only child"".) Lysette Anthony is sweet and warm as Florence, the daughter whom he cannot love but instead regards as a rival for his son's affection. One of the challenges of the story (as in many of Dickens' stories) is how to handle mawkish Victorian sentimentality. This dramatization treats these risky scenes sparely and believably--without at all injecting anachronistic attitudes or behavior. For instance, a modern reader often gets impatient with how much mistreatment Florence puts up with before she finally turns her back on her father and leaves home. Here, her devotion and longing for affection is always felt, but she doesn't act like a doormat--and when the final blow comes, she is out of there.

Most of the color comes from the sideline characters: Captain Cuttle, Miss Tox (a deliciously & delicately eccentric portrayal), the blue-faced Major Bagstock, Mrs. ""Cleopatra"" Skewton, the sweetly vacant Mr. Toots, and gravelly Mr. Toodles.

My favorite was Zelah Clarke's aptly-named Susan Nipper, the short-tempered but good-hearted nurse/companion of Florence. I think this production is worth seeing on the strength of her performance alone.

And of course, Walter Gay. Too bad he's offstage for most of this story.

If the 10th episode had been equal to the other 9, I would have given this DVD 5 stars. However, at the very end, everything so carefully built up is hastily and anticlimactically ended. I was disappointed. It was so abrupt that if it hadn't been followed by the credits, I could not have believed that it was over. It has the appearance of a desperate hurry to wrap things up. They probably needed an 11th episode to allow the viewer to adjust to the new overturned state of things, and develop Dombey in his humbled state. This is the crux of the novel, and it was just dashed through. It would not be so disturbing if the preceding 9 episodes hadn't been so good.

Another disappointment is the absence of the whole sidestory of James Carker/John Carker/Harriet Carker/Alice Brown, which gives depth and explanation to James Carker's villainy. There is a theme of doubles and mirror images in ""Dombey and Son"" which was lost by the omission of these characters--John Carker, the repentant embezzler vs. James Carker, the arrogant self-righteous manager, who is ruining the company in a much worse way; the artificial old lady Mrs. Skewton vs. the witch-like Mrs. Brown, both mothers; and their exploited daughters, the proud, well-bred purchased bride, Edith vs. the bitter prostitute, Alice. And Alice's role in the final downfall of James Carker contributes one of the most icy and memorable scenes in the book. This might have taken a few more episodes to include, but it would have been worth it, to make this grand production an absolute masterpiece.

Nevertheless, if you love Dickens, you must see this production. It is rewarding in many ways. You will find jewels of enjoyment here.",1163203200,86,4479,5.024258760107816

2581796,4,B000FQIRY0,"Loved the musical score, mixing light, dark and the whimsical exactly as Dickens does. But what impressed me most about this production of a Dickens adaptation was the sense of humor throughout. Too many times film producers, and yes, the BBC, seem to be so impressed that they're filming a literary classic that they make it all high drama with none of the sense of the absurd, the irony and satire that made these books so appealing--what, in fact, made them classics, read and enjoyed down to this day. (See, for instance, the BBC's Jane Austen film adaptations in the Seventies and Eighties.)

This story of a man obsessed with his status and the narcissistic need to have a son and heir to carry on his name, at the expense of his daughter's happiness (which he is utterly indifferent to), is a quieter story, less manic and less slightly-fantastic than Dickens' usual stories. The eccentric characters remain, the manipulative characters, the ambiguous characters, and the simple and innocent characters are all there just as in all Dickens' stories, but they're all more subtly drawn and all the more convincing and real because of it. This felt almost more like an Elizabeth Gaskell tale, than Dickens. Nevertheless, it shouldn't be missed by any Dickens fan. Excellent acting throughout--and I defy anyone not to fall in love with Dombey's son. In fact, once he's gone so are the best parts of the movie.

The ending, as others have mentioned, was lacklustre, rushed and disappointing. You have no particular sense, if you haven't already read the book, that Dombey's repentence isn't anything more than momentary. There's nothing to indicate he wouldn't go back to his prideful, dominant ways as soon as he got a good meal under his belt and was once more being reverentially fawned over by Miss Tox and lovingly worshiped by his daughter. Human nature being what it is, odds are good his humility lasted only as long as his sense of having lost all and been abandoned. The producers therefore did a disservice to the viewers and the film by not showing us his real and deep turnaround.

This is a quieter, more contemplative Dickens than we are used to;  it also felt more mature, though still with its irrepressible, childishly endearing moments. A winner, best watched when you have an extended period of quiet time.",1436918400,,2329,4.858942065491184

2581810,4,B000FQIRY0,"I liked this enormously, and have only to criticize the difference in appearance between its Florence and Little Dombey from their counterparts in the book's illustrations. It kept snapping me out of belief. Though very good actors, they were both far too fat and healthy. I did appreciate the way Florence wept through the movie the way she depressingly does through the book while maintaining our pity regardless. She'd never behave like that in this century: she'd seize maladjustment with both hands. The movie is beautifully true to its period. But the movie is true to the book, too.
It should appeal to any who like Dickens.
That's the movie. I was really annoyed because Amazon didn't mention that the disc wouldn't work in Australia where I live. I had to get a new CD player to watch it. If there was any justice, you'd shout me.  .  .",1371859200,,845,4.6644295302013425
2581811,4,B000FQIRY0,"First off, I just want to say that I recently finished reading this book and purchased the film immediately after finishing the book. I really liked this film but, unfortunately, it was truly incomplete. I know that a Dickens novel tends to be very long and very rich with descriptions so some characters have to be eliminated. Also, when the BBC produced this work back in the early 1980s they were on a tight budget so perhaps some cutting was essential for them to do so.

  However, after having written the above, the elimination of the James/John/Harriet Carker angle as well as the Mrs. Brown/Alice Brown segments was a huge disappointment since they are crucial pieces to Mr. Dombey's redemption from a self important, self righteous, selfish, arrogant, and cold man to a humbled man. As the story goes, Mr. Dombey owns Dombey & Sons which is a shipping business  he hopes to pass on to his son and heir while his daughter grows up feeling unloved and neglected by her father after his wife dies in childbirth giving life to their son, Paul. Even in the domestic sphere Mr. Dombey runs the household as though it were a business. In the film, only James Carker, Dombey's manager, gets to make an appearance.

  Furthermore, as others have mentioned, the ending of the film is baffling. (HERE COMES THE SPOILER): In the book, after Florence runs away from home, she eventually gets reunited with her true love, Walter Gay, and they end up marrying while her father's fortunes go tumbling like a house of cards. In the filmed version after she meets up with Walter she visits her reformed father, apologizes for running away, her father apologizes as well for his treatment of his daughter, and then that's the ending. It should have shown her taking her ailing father into her married home to take care of him and showing Mr. Dombey playing with his grandchildren. Yet, to end abruptly as though the production ran out of film is strange.

  In all honesty, perhaps BBC should do a remake of ""Dombey and Son"" since I am sure that BBC has gone a long way since the 1980s. True, the film itself is close to the actual book and the characters portrayed are as written in the book. The DVD is great although double-sided and the colors, print, and sound are wonderful.",1359936000,13,2271,4.655

2581817,2,B000FQIRY0,"This is the worst adaptation of literature for TV that I have seen, and I have seen many.  The acting is comical, when it is not wooden (Mr. Domby).  It seems more like a high school play that was filmed by a parent than it does any kind of decent TV production.  And it goes on for 10 episodes like that.  The end is so simplistically trite that I felt cheated after putting in so much time watching the rest of the story.",1275004800,4,423,4.0602409638554215
2581818,4,B000FQIRY0,"I've enjoyed each and every piece of Charles Dickens I can get my hands on. I enjoyed Donbey and Son too, but was this really the ending? I think not. It couldn't be. Throughout the whole thing I was waiting, looking forward to the time when Dombey and Daughter came about. Well, it did, but not like I thought.

The  acting was excellent and the characters marvelous, as always. This was not the way I wanted it to end though. It was a pleasant enough ending, with good winning out over evil, which is always what I'm rooting for in a plot, but HOW it won out was not what I expected. I wanted more.

This is not my favorite Charles Dickens novel/movie/DVD, but I'm glad I now know what Dombey and Son is all about, in case it ever comes up in conversation with people who talk about these things at parties.",1274572800,,809,4.2745098039215685
2581819,3,B000FQIRY0,"Having not read the book yet, I enjoyed this movie.  Dickens is a master.  I discovered that it was filmed in the 80's and I hope that it is redone by Andrew Davies.

2581821,4,B000FQIRY0,"If you like Dickens' books you will certainly appreciate this TV version with its authentic recreation of Victorian times.

Will Dombey find an heir to his business after his son tragically dies since the family inheritance is so important? He is a strange fellow locked in his own status, something which the elite valued so highly at that time.

The DVD is double sided and includes the entire miniseries of almost five hours in length.  It is really a bargain for the amount of material it contains.  The only thing these BBC series don't have is the more elaborate sets of the Dickens' big screen movies made over the years.  But with the fine characters and actors who played them, the programs had a standard of high quality.

The whole sub-story of Carker's brother, sister, wronged girlfriend, etc  are omitted and that's more or less ok. The tragedy of having to cut a lot is the ending is so abrupt, without the resolution(s) of the novel. I actually re-started side 2, thinking there was another episode and I just missed it. Ah, well.

Redemption arises from the ashes.  Although slow to start and bedeviled by excessively long transitional moments, for instance in the extended time the camera follows people coming through doors or walking down hallways, the drama is well played and the film well preserved.  As others have noted, the film, in omitting some secondary characters, loses some of the texture and interest of the book.  More disappointing, in my view, is the crash denouement.  Even with the plot restricted to just those characters the film included, the film omits (SPOILERS coming):  the delicate and glowing scene Dickens wrote showing Florence and Walter reaching their final understanding of one another; Florence's real motive for seeking a rapprochement with her estranged father; and the way the united family finally reaches its peace and happiness at the end, through the offices of the grandchildren.  The story really can bear these further developments after Walter's climactic return, developments that, indeed, extend the enjoyment and provide closure.
