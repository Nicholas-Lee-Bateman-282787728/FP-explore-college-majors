7811160,5,6301320344,"You know because this Star Trek series was animated it could stand head and shoulders above the classic TV series in terms of effects. And the WRITING is actually as good making these episodes in particular seem more like an actual Trek
show then a Saturday morning cartoon. In ""The Survivor"" a shape-
shifting alien impersonates a galactic philanthropist and nearly
breaks the heart of an Enterprise crew member. In ""The Lorelei Signal"" Kirk and comapny are hoodwinked by a matriachal society
who live forever by draining energy from men (KINKY!) and
Uhura is featured in her COOLEST moment yet as she takes command of the Enterprise. (...) Another victory for
womens lib! I enjoyed this as a gift when I was 10 years old
(because I always liked cartoons) but I loved Star Trek more
and this has both! And I do enjoy Filmation's retro-style animation! Must for Trekkers and Trekker's to be!",1080604800,2,891,4.792207792207792
7811161,4,6301320344,"The Survivor has one of the best aliens of all the TAS shows. The Vendorian foreshadows the changeling Odo by 20 years. The story has a good moral too. The Lorelei Signal is classic Sci-Fi, and features Uhura taking command for the first time. I recommend this video to all interested in the animated Star Trek!",993340800,6,311,4.571428571428571
7811162,5,6301320344,"If you're a Lt. Uhura fan, like me, you'll love seeing her gain command of the Enterprise.  The original cast give voice to the animation.",957744000,,138,4.52
