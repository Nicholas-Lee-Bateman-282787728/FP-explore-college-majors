7802670,5,6165020526,"Time travel tales have been around for a long time, and each one is necessarily a blend of fantasy and a reality rolled into a tight ball within that fantasy. The better ones make you care about the characters and in DR. JIN, I learned to do exactly that. A previous reviewer complained that he found the film bordering on ridiculousness but I swallowed the entire concept. The actual mechanism of time travel was not unlike the whack in the head endured by Twain's Connecticut Yankee. In DR. JIN, all that was required was for the hero to wake up in Korea's past lost in a gloomy forest. DR. JIN faced some actual time travel complications as various characters including Dr. Jin worried about changing history. But the focus on twenty-two episodes was a mixture of plot advancement aided by several romantic entanglements between Dr. Jin and his present day lover and his doppleganger past life lover. Though it is quite true that DR. JIN was filmed as a massive soap opera the very plot machinations that arouse continuing interest in soaps are here used. For viewers who like their fantasy sprinkled with romance and gripping characterization, DR. JIN is a winner.",1394841600,2,1168,4.787128712871287

Sorry, but this is one of the least competent Korean TV series I have ever seen. Everything, to me, was substandard: costumes, production, characterization, plot---lack of anything interesting---and I didn't care about ANY of the characters. In fact, I found almost all of them extremely irritating, especially the super-fast-talking-very-loudmouthed ""rogue"" who ""adopts"" Dr. Jin.

I watch Asian (Korean) film almost exclusively because I need subtitles. Also, NObody does certain genres as well Korean film makers. But this one was just awful.

I had just watched 24 episodes of a very similar plot about a Female doctor who travels in time back to 14th Century Korea (Goryeo). The main difference was, however, that it was stunning, beautiful, marvelous, and emotionally engaging: ""Faith: The Great Doctor.""

Of course, you are free to watch or buy what you want, but I gave this 3/4 of the first episode and just felt I was totally wasting my time. I gave it one star, to get your attention, and because I felt it brought nothing at all to the screen. ""The Great Doctor"" just eclipses it right out of the box---at the uttermost Start of episode 1 of ""The Great Doctor"" :)

7802672,3,6165020526,I love Song Seung Hoon but I have to admit the story was just too serious - you gotta have those lighter moments in a drama.  Also I liked the actress in City Hunter a lot - but she was not very exciting in this.  Watch him in My Princess and her in City Hunter instead of them both in this.,1384300800,,291,3.7540983606557377
