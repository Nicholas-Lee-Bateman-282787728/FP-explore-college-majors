8561586,3,B00B2OINW0,"The First Bound for Glory series simi-final match between Jeff Hardy & Samoa Joe was not great but pretty good. The Second Bound for Glory series simi-final match between James Storm & Bully Ray was solid even with the dumb finish. The Women's title match between Brooke Tessmacher & Tara was passable at best. The X Divison title match between Zema Ion & Sonjay Dutt was fair. The Magnus-RVD match was lazy and not that good at all. The World Tag Team title match between the team of Chirstopher Daniels & Kaz against the team of AJ Styles & Kurt Angle was a heart-stopping,high-flying,back-and-forth bout of the night. The Bound for Glory series Finals between Jeff Hardy & Bully Ray was okay but it was the storytelling that made it stand out. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1362528000,2,777,4.5177304964539005
8561587,4,B00B2OINW0,"Jeff Hardy vs. Samoa Joe - This was the first semi-final match in the Bound For Glory series with the winner advancing to the finals later that night & also rematch from their previous Bound For Glory series match earlier in the week on Impact with Joe coming into the match with a bad arm.  The match went to the floor early on before making it's way back into the ring where Joe used his size & strength to his advantage grounding Hardy with moves like the chinlock & nerve hold while also delivering a suicide forearm smash but ended up hurting his own arm which showed when he later went for the Muscle Buster but resulted in various counters by Hardy who targeted that arm with holds like a armbar, twisting kick, Whisper In The Wind, and Twist Of Fate.  This was a good opening match.

James Storm vs. Bully Ray - This was the first semi-final match in the Bound For Glory series with the winner advancing to the finals later that night & with James Storm being in the lead in the Bound For Glory series, he got to select his opponent for this night in Bully Ray as a way to redeem himself from their Series match last year.  Bully Ray kept stalling from destroying fan signs to throwing chairs on the outside & complaining to the referee while going to floor whenever Storm started to gain offense before Storm eventually went outside & brought the fight to Bully.  They traded momentum with both men taking hard strikes with Storm stomping on Bully's hands while he retaliated raking Storm's eyes with Bully taking control beating down Storm followed by a bearhug before they continued to back & forth as Storm delivered a top rope crossbody followed by a Bully Bomb by Bully Ray as the referees kept getting hit in the process before someone from Storm's past would end up being the difference maker.  This was a solid back & forth contest.

Knockouts Champion Ms. Tessmacher vs. Tara - As a side note for those who don't already know the story, Taryn Terrell (former WWE diva Tiffany) replaced Earl Hebner as the official referee for this & every Knockouts division match after the Hardcore Justice PPV.  This was a rematch of the ""Student vs. Teacher"" match they had weeks earlier on Open Fight Night with Tara earning the shot here as she kept getting the upperhand with her strength & taking advantage of Tessmacher hesitating towards Tara which eventually got Tessmacher angry about it to the point where Taryn had to get in the middle of them before Tara responded with a slap.  Tessmacher turned up the aggression with various clotheslines while Tara later executed the same superplex that had her win the previous match before Tara made the same type of mistake Tessmacher made earlier.  They were off with the moves a few times but a solid contest.

Street Fight Match: Austin Aries vs. ""Armbreaker"" - This was a non-sanctioned fight without a referee with the current TNA Champion against the masked member of Aces & Eights who injured Aries arm weeks earlier.  Aries took the fight right to ""Armbreaker"" both on the inside & outside of the ring to the point where he had to resort to a low blow to get an advantage using the ringside steps only for Aries to use a dirty tactic of his own as they kept trying to out-cheat each other from power to using a chair & even knocking out the other with a roll of coins.  This all resorted to an all out with the TNA roster vs. Aces & Eights with one person ending up being a causality.

X Division Champion Zema Ion vs. Sonjay Dutt - Both men went back & forth early as Ion kept trying to show off while Dutt was pulling out various moves from a springboard position including a double springboard armdrag.  Ion attempted to ground Sonjay working over his previously injured shoulder with a submission & moves like an electric chair powerbomb while Sonjay was able to regain the momentum with a standing moonsault, springboard dive, and Slice Bread #2.  This was a fun athletic match.

Rob Van Dam vs. Magnus - RVD was able to gain control with his educated feet to the point where he kicked Magnus so hard that he was sent to the floor but Magnus was able to take advantage with a mistimed move by RVD allowed Magnus to work over RVD's leg with moves like the Texas Cloverleaf while taunting the crowd & executing his signature flying elbow.  Solid match.

TNA Tag Team Champions Christopher Daniels & Kazarian vs. A.J. Styles & Kurt Angle - Angle came into this match with his hamstring taped up as him & Styles were very aggressive from the start such as their intense backdrop on Kaz & backbreaker Styles causing Kaz & Daniels to take a shortcut in order to gain control keeping their momentum by double teaming Styles while keeping him grounded.  Both teams continued to pull out some impactful holds of their own like Angle was able to take the momentum back with his german suplexes that landed Kaz on his head, Kaz & Daniels giving Angle at DDT, Angle's running AngleSlam from the top rope that flew Kaz & across the ring & inside out, Kaz's dropkick that launched Styles into the corner, another AngleSlam that landed Kaz on the back of his head, Kaz money flipping Styles into Daniels who was able to turn it into a head scissors takedown, Styles' 450 splash, and Kaz's Flux Capacitor from the top rope.  Very intense & aggressive from start to finish as everyone working hard making this the match of the night.

Jeff Hardy vs. Bully Ray - This was the finals of the Bound For Glory Series but due to the incident of what happened earlier in the night & Jeff Hardy getting injured, we got a completely different Bully Ray than usual from the pre-match promo to his confrontation with Hulk Hogan before the match & even showing respect to Hardy for coming out despite being injured.  Hardy heavily favored his arm as Bully attacked his with stomps & kicks as he was defenseless but kept refusing to stay down as Bully got more ruthless ripping off the tape & working over the arm with a keylock before Hardy was able to get some offense as they executing their signature moves such as the Twist Of Fate, Swanton Bomb, Whisper In The Wind, and Bubba Cutter.  This was their best singles match ever in terms of telling a story with Hardy being the fighting underdog & Bully having the ""Old School Anderson"" mentality of heavily working over a single body part.

Overall this was another solid presentation from TNA as this PPV did it's job in advancing the storylines going into the big Bound For Glory show but didn't come off as a ""filler"" PPV because the action ranged from solid to outstanding as there wasn't a bad match on here so another show I would recommend a viewing.",1360022400,,6648,4.538461538461538
