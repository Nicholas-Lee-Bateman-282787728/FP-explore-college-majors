Can you play these open chord positions?
Here's how it works. Grab your guitar! Play the open C chord. Now barre the 3rd fret and play the play the A form. That A form in the 3rd position( barred at the 3rd fret) is really a C chord.
If I were to write it out in tab it would look like this
-0-
-1-
-0-
-2-
-3-
-0-
This is a C chord
-3-
-5-

This is a C chord. Do you see how the A form on the 5th fret creates the C chord?
C-A-G-E-D  Now lets go to the G form. Barre the 5th fret and build the G form. Tabbed out it would look like this:
-8-

-7-

 Surprise!!!!The G form barred at the 8th fret is the C chord. This is a stretch but with practice you will master it.
C-A-G-E-D Remember the sequence. E position
-8-
-8-
-9-

C-A-G-E-D Again remember the sequence. D form. This is another stretch but give it a try.

There you have it D chord in the 10th position forms all the notes of a C chord. Pretty cool if you ask me. Just remember the sequence. Try it with the A position C-A-G-E-D

C-A-G-E-D Move to the G form. Then to the E form and D form and finally back to C
G form looks like this tabbed out

I hope I've explained in in a way you can understand wrote the tabs correctly. Having a guitar in front of you will make it easier to understand. There's a lot more to it. Ernie has you say the notes out loud as you create chords in different forms along the fretboard. Yes it works with minors, diminished and everything else you can imagine but this is how you start. If you are serious about learning the fretboard this is an excellent DVD.",1229817600,2,1678,3.8862973760932946
