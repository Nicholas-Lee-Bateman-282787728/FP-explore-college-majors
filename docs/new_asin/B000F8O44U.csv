8119133,1,B000F8O44U,"I purchased this dvd to show to my students who were studying Romeo and Juliet and who had read the novel, Romiette and Julio.  I thought the inter-racial tensions would tie in nicely to the play and the novel.  While the storyline does provide a good match, the overuse of profanity makes it impossible to use.  I understand that it is important to portray characters realistically, but swearing for swearing sake does not enhance anything, and this is true for this film. What a disappointment...save your money and if you do want to see this...rent it instead!",1269388800,,563,4.783505154639175

This movie puts the spotlight on the harsh reality that this type of thing goes on everyday, in every community.  What a shame!

I recommend this movie...",1173744000,2,333,4.409836065573771
