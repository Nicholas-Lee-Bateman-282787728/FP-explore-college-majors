5509692,4,B00ATK02FO,"The quality of the blu-ray is impeccable; it really looks stunning and is amongst the most visually elegant and beautiful of Bunuel's films.  Catherine Deneuve is transcendantly gorgeous, and Fernando Rey is enjoyably unctuous and loathsome.  Familiar Bunuelian themes of cruelty, sexual degradation, transgression.

I hadn't seen the film in close to 20 years, though, and remembered the resolution as being more satisfying.  It's not uncommon for Bunuel's films to end abruptly; this belongs to that genus.  So, thoroughly enjoyable and sumptuous to look at - but a bit of a curious ending.  Still turning it over in my head a bit.",1368489600,3,633,5.1568627450980395
5509693,5,B00ATK02FO,"Based on the quality of this product, I would definite purchase from Cohen again. Film itself is typical late Buuel, which is right in my wheelhouse. If you enjoyed his other late works, you will certainly enjoy this.",1367280000,,217,4.7368421052631575
5509694,5,B00ATK02FO,"A late period, ultimately ghoulish black comedy from the master Luis Bunuel gets a first rank presentation on dvd.  The picture elements are restored to sharp focus worthy of this twisted story.  Sadism (and a great many other isms), dismemberment, and cold examination of class structures fuel a suprising amount of genuine laughs along with gasps of shock.  Fans of Monty Python should give Bunuel's body of work a look-through, and horror fans should note that a great many master directors of the genre (including Alfred Hitchcock, George Romero, Roger Corman and John Carpenter) have cited Bunuel as an influence.

Catherine Denueve's ice princess qualities serve her well in this film, and in this film (as she was in her previous collaboration with Bunuel, ""Belle DuJour"") Ms. Deneuve is equally all-in for the various degredations Bunuel cooked up for her character go through.  Alain Delon and Fernando Rey (Bunuel's go-to guy for portraying middle- or late-aged letchers) do some great work here as well.

As cited above, the picture elements are impressively restored and the sound was better than I've ever heard the movie (including on the big screen at a theatre) so obviously some effort went into creating the dvd and it shows.",1366416000,2,1243,5.068627450980392
5509695,3,B00ATK02FO,"First, I would give the restored Blu-Ray print 5 stars. As for the movie, it is called Bunuel's masterpiece. I don't see it. It is interesting, but not a great film. I am not a huge fan of Bunuel's films. I found this movie a little slow moving.",1365552000,2,245,4.125
5509696,5,B00ATK02FO,"At first I was hesitant to get too excited about this newly released Luis Buuel film due to the fact that I had read that Cohen Media had done some altering to Buuel's original ending. However, upon research, I have determined that they worked from the same negative as Criterion but as Criterion's rights to the film had expired - Cohen Media was able to take up the project again with the technology of HD. The ending is NOT altered. However, those who were lucky enough to see the film in Europe upon its initial release did see several frames omitted to the US release.

Note: Cohen media offers Luis Buuel's alternate ending as a special feature.

I do not think Luis Buuel's vision has been altered or damaged. In fact, I feel it has been preserved. TRISTANA is far from his best work but offers a great deal to enjoy and contemplate. The additional features are awesome -- including Deneuve's own journal log while the movie was being filmed.

For fans of surrealism and Luis Buuel's work -- this is worth the money. Repeated viewings offer the viewer multiple layers of meaning. And, as always, Catherine Deneuve's icy beauty is at once erotic and disturbing.

My only complaint has nothing to do with the film's remastering or presentation but the odd habit developed in the late 60's thru the 70's when International Film Directors created specific region films with International casts who could not speak the language. The voice dubbing is distracting to me. However, with Luis Buuel's or even Fellini -- the distraction has an odd hypnotic effect. Irrationally, the dubbing adds to the dream-like quality. Or, at least, that is how I like to think of it.",1365033600,5,1667,4.7379310344827585
5509697,5,B00ATK02FO,"Hello. I'm posting this review to let everyone know that the new Blu ray of Luis Bunuel's TRISTANA is excellent both in quality as well as being complete. There is an extra feature of an alternate ending in which a few shots are different, but contrary to an earlier post, the ending on the main feature is exactly the same as when I saw this film at the NYFF & also in theatres. The image quality of this Blu ray is very film like and quite beautiful. In fact, I would say that watching this Blu ray is for me a revelation, bringing out facets of the film I had never noticed before. The image is a touch darker in a few interior scenes than when this film was released, but I don't find this to be a problem. In fact, the difference is so slight as to be a non-issue.

In terms of the quality of Bunuel's film, rather than give my own opinion, I'll simply quote Alfred Hitchcock, who felt after seeing TRISTANA that Bunuel was ""the world's greatest living director"" and that he had never before seen ""such brilliant direction of actors"" in a film.

I also must say that the extras on this disc are themselves worth the price of admission, in particular, a film long conversation between Catherine Deneuve and Kent Jones, about her career, her methods of expressing the characters she has played, and her memories of the directors she has worked with. In addition, there is a half hour conversation with Bunuelian scholar Peter William Evans on the struggle of Bunuel to make TRISTANA for over a decade in Spain, and a booklet that includes an essay by Richard Porton, fragments of Ms. Deneuve's diary written during the production of TRISTANA & an excerpt from Raymond Durgnat's book on Bunuel.",1363219200,23,1696,4.521172638436482
5509698,5,B00ATK02FO,"I read the warning here from another potential buyer complaining about the excision of certain frames from the movie's end-montage, so sent an email to the Cohen Group asking about it.
Here's their reply, which sounds very positive indeed, so I'll be ordering this new Blu ray

""Thank you for your e-mail.  The version of the feature TRISTANA that we are releasing is exactly the same version that Criterion released on VHS and Laserdisc in the mid 1990's - though the quality is far superior.  Our scan is from an original negative, as confirmed by one of Criterion's lead producers (This restoration began with Criterion, but not completed before their license expired).  We've checked the negative and there are no physical cuts to the ending montage sequence introducing new material.  However, we were made aware that a few shots in the end montage differ from the version available in Europe.  We accessed this ending and include it as an alternate ending.

Among other extras, we have included

- a feature length audio commentary between Catherine Deneuve and critic Kent Jones,
- a 30 minute visual essay about the film featuring Buuel scholar Peter William Evans,
- excerpts from Deneuve's diary entries written during production,
- a new essay by Cineaste editor Richard Porton
- a chapter on the film from scholar Raymond Durgnat's now out of print book on Buuel, and
- Spanish and English language dialogue tracks.

We feel that you will agree that this is the best looking version available anywhere.""

Quality is very good-excellent and highly recommended.  Deneuve is chilling in this spell-binding, eerie story that is perverse, personal, and complex as Bunuel rips into patriarchal society and the Church.",1383955200,2,381,5.112903225806452
5509703,4,B00ATK02FO,"A fascinating film at several levels.  Don Lope is a cad and hypocrite, but an interesting old man.  He isn't a hypocrite about sex, however.  Early on, we find the old man making a try at virtually every female that crosses his path.  Later, he explains his sexual philosophy to friends.  I'll paraphrase:  ""A man must convince her to want it even if she doesn't.""  Tristiana--who is supposed to be a girl in her late teens--loses her mother and becomes Don Lope's ward.  Therefore we learn, even before it happens, that his beautiful, young female ward--Tristana--is in for a very bad time.  Of course it happens and seduction is too soft of a word for it.  It's rape that the girl has no power over.  Nevertheless--and probably unsurprisingly--Don Lope, as time goes on, does show some personal responsibility of his crippled ward [crippled in more than one way].

Lope's form of evil is an unfortunately common one.  But Don Lope is by no means your average man and his hypocrisy runs deep, indeed.  While seemingly favoring [in his indolent way] something like socialism, he is precisely the opposite of one of their ""Workers"", although he shows his sympathy for the 'underdog'--in one notable scene, he misdirects the police who are chasing a common purse-snatcher.

Here I should mention that the time for this movie [for me, at least] is blurred.  The book ""Tristana"" was written during the 19th century but the movie is more recent as evidenced by dress, the uniforms of the Guardia Civil and especially telephones.  On the other hand Don Lope officiates in duels which may be a deliberate anachronism or in keeping with the original novel.  This is important given the time frame of Spain's various political struggles.  To me the film seems to be set in post-Republican Spain and the various violent demonstrations on the street would therefore be anti-Franco.  If so, our 'hero', Don Lope seems to be vaguely anti-Franco with, again, vaguely, socialist and, perhaps even communist, sympathies.  The producers may have been deliberately vague about this to pass Spanish censors.

Don Lope tells us that he hasn't worked a day in his life and has no intention of doing so.  Although he lives in something like genteel poverty, he expects to be waited on hand-and-foot and is precisely the parasite that the communists warn their followers about [to be certain many communists and their apologists are just as hypocritical as Don Lope]. I believe that the irony of of this will be lost on most Americans watching this film but not on the Europeans this film is directed at.  Don Lope--a man who is truly without honor-- has old fashioned and prickly ideas about his personal honor.  He officiates in illegal duels and clownishly challenges a man to a duel, himself.

I've told enough about the tale but the bulk of the film is about the damage, jealousy and withering hatred borne out of the crime of child abuse.",1376438400,4,2922,4.82897384305835
5509704,5,B00ATK02FO,"I'm not hugely into surrealist / avant-garde cinema but I love Belle de Jour and Tristana from Luis Bunuel. The stories and characters are unusual and strong enough to hold one's attention and there is a deliciously layered treatment that makes them worth returning to time and again. Anyway, this blu-ray from Cohen Media gives a fantastic presentation of Tristana. Based on a new restoration, the high-definition image has a richness of palette that simply blows away most previous releases that look drab and washed out in comparison. Detail is exquisite and a layer of fine grain confirms the integrity of the image without distracting from it in any way. There is also a wonderful pick of extras including an audio commentary and several other interesting featurettes, and a booklet with critical writing on the film and excerpts from lead actor Catherine Deneuve's diary from when she was shooting for the film. This is a Criterion quality-package and significantly cheaper than releases from the big C. I strongly urge you to pick it up if you like good European cinema.",1375833600,5,1077,4.988888888888889
5509705,3,B00ATK02FO,"Quality of picture is good. Sound is adequate for the then-technology. Very disappointing re: lack of French dialogue optional tract. The Castilian soundtrack is appropriate for the context (it IS a Spanish movie based on a Spanish novel...) but the dub-over voice for Deneuve is irritating. Mademoiselle Deneuve is so well known that they could have chosen a better voice / timber quality to match hers. The American - dubbed soundtrack is worse. The art of dubbing in the US is not where near the sophitication of European tradition, with mechanical passive reading of the text.",1373846400,8,580,5.052083333333333
5509706,5,B00ATK02FO,"In this film, Bunuel says a great deal about Spain, love, aging and honor. I would not say it is all negative, but it is very critical. Clearly his point of view is unusual, but as in all of his films, thought provoking. In many ways, Bunuel is more a Christian fundamentalist than most church-goers.",1372636800,,300,4.472727272727273

Main credits are fuzzy and grainy but this is the way the have always looked before. The rest of the movie, except for a very brief segment in Don Lope's kitchen, look wonderful. Nice to have the original spanish language track too (yes, Deneuve and Nero are dubbed here but the rest of the cast aren't). The ending is missing the last shot from the version widely known here in Spain but that ending is presented as a bonus (in SD). Truly recommended.",1371340800,3,610,4.504504504504505
5509708,3,B00ATK02FO,"This Blu-ray is an exemplary HD transfer of a genuine restoration of one of Bunuel's late masterworks.  It hasn't looked this good since its original release.  But I was shocked to find a dubbed English soundtrack instead of the French version which was originally exhibited in this country and throughout Europe.  Previous DVD issues had the French soundtrack as an option.  So we never get to hear Deneuve's voice in one of her most important roles.  A real oversight by the Cohen Media Group and a major disappointment. Since no other review seems to mention this, I thought the potential buyer should know.",1370822400,8,610,4.883495145631068
5509709,4,B00ATK02FO,"A provocative drama from director Luis Buuel. The story begins in Toledo in 1929, and the title refers to the central character, played by Catherine Deneuve, who we follow from her teenage years into womanhood. After the death of her parents, young Tristana is taken in by a wealthy older gentleman who espouses both the noble codes of honor of the nineteenth century and the free-thinking ideals of the twentieth. Soon, however, his attitude toward the girl drifts away from the paternal, and irrevocable choices are made.

Aside from a central dream sequence, Tristana is the most conventional narrative of the director's late career, and yet it still contains many of the same surrealist themes that can be seen throughout his work, including freedom versus society, free will versus destiny, hypocrisy, corruption, love, sex and sin. As usual, Buuel has fun exploring the inconsistent and two-faced nature of human beings; in particular, the character of Don Lope is one of the most flawed and paradoxical figures in all of Buuel's cinema. Meanwhile an attentive viewer will find much to think about and many ambiguities to interpret. It is a film that can be looked at from many angles; the essay in the accompanying booklet sees in it extended metaphors for the politics and history of pre-Franco spain, whereas the commentator in the featurette views Freud as the major influence.

The film is also interesting for Deneuve's masterful portrayal of her character's transformation from the simple innocence of youth to the strange and frightening creature Tristana ultimately becomes.

The quality of the Cohen Media DVD package is quite good; the booklet and documentary provide a solid background to the film, and while the commentary featuring Deneuve herself may not exactly be revelatory for Buuel aficionados, it is still interesting to hear the actress speak about her experience on the film. The restoration is good, even if the color seems a bit over-saturated at times. Overall I would definitely recommend the package to fans of Buuel and Deneuve, as well as anyone else who enjoys exploring the enigmas and dark corners of the human heart.",1370649600,6,2156,5.101983002832861

8557597,4,B00ATK02FO,"I am a huge fan of Luis Bunuel films as well as an admirer of Catherine Deneuve but nonetheless it took me a while to  watch this film again . It worked for me on several levels. The setting in Toledo Spain and the time period in which the story takes place is brilliantly captured. The primary characters are full of contrasts and evolve as the story progresses in a way that is intriguing and draws the viewer in. Deneuve's performance  combines the innocence of her youthful character with the hard heartedness that gradually develops in her as a result of her circumstances perfectly.
There are a few surrealistic scenes that worked less well than the rest of the film and some of the lesser characters didn't quite measure up for me but overall I enjoyed this.  The Plot reminded me both of Madam Bovary and Pygmalion  in some respects.",1480464000,,841,4.586666666666667
8557598,4,B00ATK02FO,"I liked this much better on 2nd viewing.  The first time around it seemed obvious, heavy handed, and much less playfully interesting than Bunuels other work from the period (e.g. Belle De Jour, The Phantom of Liberty). I still like those films more, but on revisiting, I found this more wicked fun in what at first seemed like a pretty dour, almost straightforward revenge tale.

I will say that the fact that both leads are obviously dubbed was a bit distracting.  Even in Bunuels surreal world I find that un-real in a bad way.  But this tale of an innocent girl corrupted by a upper class gentleman who believes himself liberal and above the petty rules of society as an excuse for his selfish behavior -- and the way the worm turns -- has a lot to say about all of our hypocrisies.  It just didn't quite transcend for me the way my favorite of Bunuels works do.

That said, a lot of critics count this as among his masterpieces, and as with any major film by a great film-maker you owe it to yourself to see it and make up your own mind.",1462147200,,1041,4.34020618556701

8557602,4,B00ATK02FO,"There is no contesting Luis Bunuels place as one of the most esteemed directors of world cinema. As with any director who has made his mark by being a provocateur, he is an acquired taste. For this reviewer, Bunuel has stood on the periphery of appreciation ever since he was sickened by the slicing of the eyeball (belonging to a dead calf but made to look like that of a young woman) in his ground-breaking early film Un Chien Andalou. Cinematic manipulation is as old as cinema itself but there is good taste and there is bad tasteor at least heavy-handedness as in the more saccharine of Hollywoods Spielbergian output.

The appeal of TRISTANA for the Bunuel uninitiated is simply the films beauty. This alone is cause enough to celebrate this meticulous restoration of Bunuels 1970-released film. The sumptuous colours remind of the gaudy Technicolor of Douglas Sirks best work from the 1950s. Suggesting the pallete of an artist, (such as the one Franco Nero plays in the film), Bunuels eye for colour, detail and symbolism never waivers. In this sense he is an absolute master. The way even the majority of outdoor scenes mirror the claustrophobic existence of Tristana herself is artful, yet discernible.

The best thing about the visual beauty of this film is that it is centred around one of the most beautiful faces to ever appear on screen, namely that of Catherine Deneuve, who starred in several of Bunuels films during her career. Deneuves beauty is ethereal, and she can act, though at times she appears a little stilted in TRISTANA. Her most exquisite feature is her luminous eyes, expressive and soulful. The other performances are uneven, though Fernando Rey and Franco Nero acquit themselves well. It is some of the supporting roles that come across as amateurish and forced, as in some of Rossellinis films (when he often used non-actors in his pursuit of Neo-Realism). Whether this is intentional or not, is not clear. It may well be intended, though, to complement Bunuels heightened visual style which is anything but naturalistic and entirely suggestive of a dream, or at least an allegory. That is to say, acting that appears to be acting may be what Bunuel wanted, not unlike Brechts alienation techniques on stage.

Bunuel is often cited as a filmmaker who skewered religion and other forms of authority, and while some disparaging remarks about the church are made in TRISTANA, it is hardly worth mentioning. What IS worth mentioning is that this preoccupation in Bunuels world-view appears to have tapered off later in his life. It seems Bunuel was less against God than he was against guilt, which was a reaction to his upbringing. A reassessment of Bunuels stand on matters of faith is perhaps better represented by the observation by Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes who wrote that Bunuel possessed a religious temperament without a religious faith. Perhaps he matured as he aged.

In short, though an intellectual, Bunuel was a simple man, his simplicity mirrored in his art. His shooting style was notoriously straight-forward, which saved time in the editing room and reduced the opportunity for outside interference. He had a vision and he pursued it as purely and as plainly as he could.

If TRISTANA is representative of Bunuels work it is definitely worth watching. Critics far and wide have praised the film mightily. While the films attributes may not be apparent to everyone, this gorgeous restoration by the Cohen Film Collection ensures each viewers journey of evaluation will be an aesthetically pleasing one.",1397433600,,3554,4.996621621621622

8557604,4,B00ATK02FO,"Acclaimed Spanish director Luis Bunuel (""Belle de Jour"") reunites with French actress Catherine Deneuve in what many believe to be his masterpiece.  Set in the late 1920's during a period just prior to the Spanish Civil War, the film expresses the dichotomy of the political and sexual ambiguity of the time.

Tristana (Deneuve) is a girl in her late teens and the daughter of a woman who has just died.  The woman had been under the employ of Don Lopo (Fernando Rey), a retired aristocrat but of diminishing wealth.  Lopo had promised the woman he would take care of her daughter.  At first he tells Tristana he would treat her as a daughter but alas it isn't long before we realize he has other things in mind.  Without apparent malice he insists she remain indoors other than to go to church.  While she's not technically locked up, Tristana obeys.  As time passes, Tristan ventures off to town, usually in the company of the housekeeper Saturna (Lola Gaos) and her deaf teenage son Saturno (Jesus Fernandez).  On one of these adventures she meets a local artist named Horacio (Franco Nero) who she promises to pose for.  The two fall in love.

Eventually Tristana leaves Don Lopo and his protection and lives with Horacio.  In a great performance, Ms. Deneuve transforms from the innocent and nave young woman to an icy cold and bitter partner for Horacio.  Her outlook on life is exacerbated when a tumor is discovered in her leg which must be amputated.  She longs to return to Don Lopo, but for the comfort of his home and the care of Saturna.  She is well beyond any romantic interests.

Don Lopo has changed over time as well.  While the lothario in Rey's character was obviously there early on, Don Lopo is not seen as menacing.  The culture of the time in Spain suggest his behavior was not unusual.  Women were subservient and subject to the wishes of men.  He has now mellowed.  He's even friends now with the Catholic priests which he abhorred but Tristana exalted.  Tristana and Don Lopo do get married but it is never consummated much to the disappointment of the remorseful Don Lopo.  Tristana is clearly in charge now.

There are numerous metaphors used by Bunuel throughout the film dealing with society's contradictions, political discourse, class distinctions and religious intrusions.  Most are not obvious.  There is little to criticize about the film other than it does become a bit tedious at times.  And while we accept the character transitions of Don Lopo and certainly Tristana, I wouldn't expect that from Horacio who just disappears.  I recommend the film.

The Blu ray transfer was handled by the Cohen Media Group which is releasing more and more of these classic films in Blu ray.  They have done a good job.  With a 1080p transfer the film retains the original 1.66:1 aspect ratio and is free of blemishes.  The film is rather dark in tone however which may be accurate or may be the result of the restoration.  Frankly I don't know.  Colors seem accurate and on the whole, this is a fine looking film.  Detail is good and I don't remember seeing Ms. Deneuve more beautiful.

I had an interesting experience with the audio.  Available in Spanish and English with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, I originally selected Spanish with English subtitles.  I usually go with the original language.  About half way through I realized that Deneuve and Nero were being dubbed in Spanish.  While I don't know either actor's proclivity for language, French and Italian respectively are the actor's native tongues.  So I switched over to the English dubbing.  It was neither better nor worse, but at least I didn't have to read subtitles.  The audio is very good, clear and well balanced.

Extras include a booklet with an essay by critic Richard Porton, excerpts from a dairy kept by Deneuve during the shoot and excerpts from Raymond Durgnat's book on Luis Bunuel.  In addition the disc includes an interview with Deneuve by Kent Jones from 2012, a look at the film by Bunuel scholar Peter William Evans, an alternate ending, a restoration trailer and the original French theatrical trailer.",1391385600,5,4116,4.784090909090909
