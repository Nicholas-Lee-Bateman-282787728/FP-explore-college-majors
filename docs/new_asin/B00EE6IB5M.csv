8604529,5,B00EE6IB5M,"This is late-Sylvie Guillem, a good-bye to her career; whoever reads this kind of review will know what a superb dancer she was, and what to expect from the choreography of Mats Ek. The filming is also excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who loves modern dance.",1410393600,4,267,4.583333333333333

8604531,5,B00EE6IB5M,"I am giving this dvd five stars, and it's for quality, not quantity, as one gets here only about twenty or so minutes of dance plus fifteen or so minutes of a background video.  This is Guillem at age 47, sans makeup, hair short on the sides and in a long braid in the back, but still Sylvie Guillem as we know her:  always expressive, always throwing herself into her dancing, still dancing with great amplitude and a firm balance.  And yet, this ballet (or modern-meets-ballet in typical Mats Ek style) could really only be danced by one ""of a certain age"", as it concerns--somehow--choices being made or considered by an ""older"" woman at an apparent turning point in her life.
  I cannot say that I understand intellectually this dance, although the ""Bye"" aspect shines through, but I have no pressing desire for such an understanding--I find it satisfying in-and-of itself and always intriguing.  That intriguing-ness persists and begins from the get go:  close-ups of Guillem's eyes yielding to a black-and-white moving image of her apparently behind a vertical 6' x 3' white screen or panel, around which she reaches in color.  This panel is omnipresent and reminds me of the monolith found on the moon in ""2001""--it seems to possess a similar significance.
  The music is the arietta (the second movement) from Beethoven's Op. 111 piano sonata, played by Ivo Pogorelich in a sensitive (and slower than ""normal"") performance.  (Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, the Op. 111 arietta was Beethoven's ""bye"" to composing for the piano.)  No question but that the dance and its meanings meld successfully with this music.
  We learn in the background video that two-and-a-half days were taken to film this 20-minute piece and that Ek acted not only as choreographer but also as director and cinematographer.  No booklet enclosed.
  If you are a Guillem fan, get this, or if you are a Mats Ek fan.  Frankly, I think that even non-dance-devotees would appreciate it.  As I experience it, ""Bye"" here, despite the title's tie to time, has a strong timeless element to it.  Highly recommended.",1385337600,21,2092,4.939828080229226
