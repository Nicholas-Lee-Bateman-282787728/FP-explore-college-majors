7961532,5,B000065U4N,"I have Fibromyalgia and find it difficult if not impossible to follow any excercise program without a increase to my constant level of pain. Its not uncommon for me to take a pain killer before attempting exercising or stretching. My doctor recommended Yoga. I decided to give ""Discover Gentle Yoga moments pm workout"" a try. It is a program that incorporates Yoga, stretching, and relaxation targeted for the mature body and mind. I was surprised to find my pain easing during the program. I felt refreshed and had considerable less muscle pain than I normally do. For that alone I highly recommend this tape. The first time I did have to shorten some of the stretches and pace myself, but I did about 35 minutes of the 60. Due to fibromyalgia I have a hard time sustaining some of the yoga poses. I am sure, given time I will be able to work up to the full hour. Finally, exercise I can do and feel better rather than worse! This tape is good for back problems as well and for the first time in months I was able to bend over and not have intense pain. Wow!  The tape states that it will bring immediate and lasting benefits. That is a true statement for the immediate.....I can't say yet for the lasting, but I do recommend this tape if you have fibromyalgia.",1154131200,3,1262,4.439655172413793

I have three problems with these videos. 1) There is no yoga here.  Just lots of talking, breathing, mostly simple stretching and easy movements, half of which are done sitting in a chair. Thirty minutes of floor stretching would have been much more effective and would have added interest.  If she didn't talk so much, she could have demonstrated more exercises.  2) Among the simple stretches, Lilias throws in a few stretches that would be virtually impossible for someone to do who does have a problem moving thier joints or has a stiff back.  Pulling back muscles while trying to perform some of the stretches is very possible. 3) Very boring! After doing the AM workout, I just wanted to go right back to bed!",1131580800,3,830,4.736111111111111
