7052632,5,B00UMDEVIC,"I have enjoyed this series tremendously. It is just a really good series with a whole lot of very good actors in it. It's fun to see some actors who have been in other series in this series. I like the scenery and the houses, too. There are a lot of funny parts as well as poignant parts. I think most PBS fans would like this series very much. It is nice to see a love story between older people for a change. They seem to be so real and genuine in their roles.",1435276800,30,462,3.925531914893617

7052715,5,B00UMDEVIC,"People have recommended the series to me, but at first, I wasn't that keen to watch it.  Who wants to see a show about geriatric love, I thought.  But boy, am I glad I watched it.  It is a tremendously entertaining show that centers around an elderly couple who reunite via Facebook, decades (or a lifetime) after an almost-romance as teenagers.  But there are so many quirky, intersecting plot lines involving their respective families that make this show so immensely fun to watch.  All the characters - including Alan & Celia, the elderly couple - are flawed in such a human way that draws you into their stories.  The posh & stoic Caroline with her (initially) forbidden romance, the human train wreck Gillian who seems to look for trouble & bad relationships, & John, Caroline's useless & weak-minded ex-husband.  It's a drama about dysfunctional relationships & imperfect people that manages to have a funny, warm & light tone, that makes it prone to binge-watching.

The performances are wonderful.  Derek Jacobi & Anne Reid are pro's, with all the theater & TV experience between them.  Sarah Lancashire is brilliant as Caroline.  Just to see how great she is, watch Happy Valley, a gritty crime drama in which she plays a tough police sergeant.  In fact, Happy Valley was also created by the talented Sally Wainwright, the creator of Last Tango, & the 2 shows couldn't be more different.  What they have in common is that they are both gripping & addictive.

Great, quality show, highly recommended!",1454457600,,1508,4.862745098039215

7052743,5,B00UMDEVIC,"N.B. the Seasons all tie together and can make one very long and entertaining story. Watched Season 1 and thoroughly enjoyed it. Had to then watch Season 2 and loved that. Season 3 was almost as much fun as the others. This is an English show with its more subtle type humor and situation type comedy. The characters are interesting, almost real type people that you feel for. Probably geared towards a more mature crowd (?). Watch the first episode or two of Season 1. If you like, only watch the balance in season order. Season 3 is not as riveting as the first two, but if you've gotten that far, how could you stop?",1450051200,,619,4.391304347826087

7052784,1,B00UMDEVIC,"Surprised that no review has mentioned the ""alternate plot"" that shows up in Season 3. It makes the trilogy (so far) disjointed. Instead of having the story pick up where it left off in Season 2, Gary shows up, as if for the first time and we begin to go through all that again. I understand flashbacks but this is no flashback. It's a new storyline that conflicts with the original. Also in the opening episode, Katie is alive and pregnant so you either have to deny her tragic death in Season 2 or get ready to experience it once again. I had been excited to start Season 3, but after the first episode, think I'll move on.",1447545600,3,625,4.305084745762712

7052818,3,B00UMDEVIC,"I so enjoyed LTIH that I purchased Season 1 and 2. But, I was really disappointed with Season 3. In eliminating, Kate Sally Wainwright substituted one story line (lesbian relationship) for another (single mom) and very quickly since Caroline-Kate's relationship hardly seemed explored. Also, in my opinion, the characters of Gillian and Caroline were recast and less appealing that the two women Wainwright had drawn with courageous, bold strokes.  They seemed weak and silly in Episode 6's finale.  Nonetheless, this does not mean I am not looking forward to Season 4. To paraphrase Gillian, when you love someone, don't you love them warts and all?  Poor Wainwright.  She has spoiled us;  we expect to be 100% delighted from her many gifts every time out.  Bottom line: This is a fine, British series with a superb cast and writer.  Watch it.",1445904000,,844,4.985714285714286
7052819,5,B00UMDEVIC,I so enjoy this series. The complexity of the characters makes for thoughtful viewing. I wish it was available in the U.S. concurrently with the British broadcast schedule.,1445904000,,172,5.178571428571429

7052854,1,B00UMDEVIC,"No doubt most viewers liked all three seasons. However there were awful plot failures in this season. While there are stellar actors, almost none were given a story line that complemented their skills. Alan's illegitimate son, Kate's death (while fully pregnant, on the day after her wedding) was just plain cruel and added nothing to the integrity of LTiH. Celia regresses to racist and homophobic comments, Caroline falls in manure and can't even find a tablecloth to cover her outfit while Robbie vomits while saying his vows. Please!

7052856,5,B00UMDEVIC,"This is a old fashioned ""soap opera"" set in a beautiful place, with great actors and production values. I did watch  American soaps in the 70-80s, so I don't mean anything bad by ""soap opera"". ""Action packed"" might be an appropriate description too. The characters Alan and Celia are never forgotten while the other generations get screen time, all the families mix together.

7052936,1,B00UMDEVIC,"Seasons 1 and 2 were wonderful, but I wouldn't waste my money on this one. The storyline devolved into typical soap opera fare right off the bat with the long lost son and the tragic accident. The plot is  trite and unbelievable. The acting is stellar however, especially Sarah Lancashire. She does her best but even she can't save this drivel. If I were you I'd stop at Season 2.",1443657600,7,380,4.428571428571429

7052939,5,B00UMDEVIC,"Normally I don't care a great deal for the so-called soap opera type of dramas that appear frequently on the large or small screen finding them too heavy-laden with clichs, stereo-typical characters being, to me, poorly acted, etc.  The wonderful British series Last Tango in Halifax, for me, is the exception to my dislike of the genre.  Now in its third (3rd) season, Last Tango is adored by me.

Season three (3) is acted and directed so very good! Derek Jacoby is fantastic as husband/ father/stepdad having recently married his sweetheart from his youth acquiring step children plus, being a widower, bring to the mix.a daughter  that requires much high maintenance plus having an unknown adult sonportrayed marvelously by one of my favorite actors, Rubert Graves,  Jacobys new wife is acted wonderfully by Anne Reidshe too adds to the great mix and/or brew--children with issues such as lesbianism, nasty divorces, rebellious kids, etc. What a wonderful cauldron of family happenings--I am always intrigued.  This somewhat frightening mix is extremely very evident in Series three (3).  However, the story lines are all believable ( often very funny) and so well acted by ALL.

As I stated before, Season three (3) is so very good with all of the actors in top form and I  really look forward to more series of Last Tango in Halifax"".",1443571200,6,1340,4.946428571428571

7053641,4,B00UMDEVIC,"'Last Tango' is one of my favorite shows - it takes a stumble at the outset of Season 3 but ultimately wins out thanks again to the writing prowess of series creator and workhorse Sally Wainwright (she's written all 18 episodes to date) and the show's power axis: the dynamic duo of Sarah Lancashire  (Caroline) and Nicola Walker (Gillian). These two are joined through the late-in-life union of their respectively widowed parent (Caroline's Mom + Gillian's Dad).

As first conceived, the show was about those two - Derek Jacobi's Alan and Anne Reid's Celia.  Now though, the series clearly flows through the daughters.  Wainwright''s talent is that she gives her characters big, meaty one-on-ones.  No quick-hit, made-for-TV fluff here.  When Caroline and Gillian talk, it goes on.  And on and on - often seven or eight minutes of riveting conversation.  Both have a lot to deal with in Season 3 - Caroline, alas, has to deal with a tragic loss (frankly, I thought this was a cheap trick by Wainwright -- too soap opera-y and out of character with the tone of the rest of the show). Her acting has been been better.

Gillian, meanwhile, prepares for her wedding with Robbie -- a decision covered in decades of complexity, backstory and emotional entanglement Short story: Robbie is the brother of Gillian's ex, Eddie, now deceased...in Season 3 we get additional layers of information about Eddie's treatment of Gillian and Robbie's implicit knowledge of what was happening.  A lot of this information starts tumbling out as the wedding hurtles near.  How Gillian acts out is  among this season's highlights.",1439596800,,1609,4.962686567164179

7053693,4,B00UMDEVIC,"A story where the majority of characters are highly dysfunctional. May mimick life but I don't particularly care to embrace dis function as a virtue. There are some very funny moments and situations but I think the writers are portraying disfunctional as something that should be accepted  and anything otherwise is to be considered politically incorrect. Definitely can tell which political leaning or view the writer is coming from. Celia likes to read the conservative news paper and she gets a few slaps on the hand for that along with a little degrading name calling, like narrow minded and bigot. Not much tolerance there from the Tolerant. Maybe next season Celia can read the liberal newspaper then she can be correct and broad minded and miserable like the rest of them.

  I like to see people overcome personal weaknesses rather than make a virtue out them. Rising above our shortcomings or mistakes and not repeating them over and over gives other people with the same problems hope. It's seems the answer here is just to have another glass of wine. Maybe season 4 will introduce the 12 step program.

Many people really like the show. My favorite character is Gillian because she's very down to earth. She knows she has problems but does not rejoice in them. There's hope for her but I doubt they'll be a turn around for her coming from the writer. I watched the show because I like the quality of BBC and Masterpiece Theater. In that respect the show is very well done. Good acting and likeable characters.",1438992000,,1520,4.76425855513308

Primary cast members are back and the biggest change is spoiler-exposed on the DVD's cover photo. New additions to the family just add numerous ways for this family to go bonkers, in hilarious ways. This is the ultimate in drama city. Never just one calamity underway, but every member gets frequent opportunity to add to the insanity of relationships tanking. Dysfunctional at its finest. It is the older generation that seems almost sane, but even they have their moments. But love is at the root of all the issues.

Season 3 has 6 new episodes.
SDH Subtitles
Cast is lead by the incredible Derek Jacobi (Cadfael - King's Speech) who is madly in love on the second chance in marriage with Celia (Anne Reid- `Bleak House' `Upstairs Downstairs'). The chemistry is magic and a delight for anyone over 55. The show is not just for the aging, as their children, and grandchildren provide as much of the plots as the older couple. Family viewing, but way, way, way beyond the normal family relationship series.
A bonus to the storyline and acting is the fantastic scenery.

Expect to see Rupert Graves in every episode. Of course, Sarah Lancashire and Nini Sosanya are back as the daughters of the reunited older couple, and parenting as well as biological providers is a question.

UPDATE:  I called Amazon directly about this and they did give me a refund.  I offered to pay for the two episodes I watched but they said that wasn't necessary.  I am grateful.
All that being said this is a terrific program.  What is it about these British shows that seem to touch a nerve, or two!  I LOVE Sarah Lancashire and Derek Jacobi.  Everyone else is very good, too.  My only complaint is the lack of development in the relationship between Caroline and Kate.  I think it should have shown better what Caroline's attraction to Kate is.

They start with twenty year olds, then thirty year olds, then forty year olds, then fifty year olds and once ( last year ) a sixty year old and then they stop!

8707467,5,B00UMDEVIC,"Lost touch with this brilliant show for a time, and have watched it on TV, online on PBS, and finally, the last two episodes on Amazon!  Just finished watching the ending episode, and seriously do not want to say good-bye to the characters I have come to love over the last few years! It was beyond wonderful, and the acting, setting, and twists and turns of the various plotlines so beautifully portrayed. It wasn't perfect at times, and perhaps a bit slow once in a while, but life is like that as well...I will really really miss being able to peek into the lives of these lovingly eccentric families and follow their trials, tribulations and celebrations. Find myself wanting to know what happens to the teenage characters in the future because they have grown up as the show developed. Perhaps Barbara Strickland could move the setting to New York and come up with a whole nother story line focused on the baby and grandma, and bring in visitors from Britain once in a while!!!",1523664000,,982,4.64367816091954
