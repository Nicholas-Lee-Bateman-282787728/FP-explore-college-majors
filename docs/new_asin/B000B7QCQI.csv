2405176,5,B000B7QCQI,"Let me say that Audioslave is the best hard rock band on the planet bar none.  It was amazing to see and hear a band making a monumental trip to Cuba and performing the first rock concert by a US band in that country.  What sets Audioslave apart from every other hard rock band are a few things:  talent, experience, songwriting, cohesiveness and intelligence.  It was refreshing to see and hear the band taking in Cuba and being moved by the people, music and spirit of the country.  This is a must have DVD for the fans of Audioslave.  The raw energy on display and in the crowd for the concert was unreal.

And a few comments for the Chris Cornell bashers:  yeah he is older, yeah he is rougher, but he remains the number one rock singer on the planet.  An outside venue with 70,000 fans screaming is not conducive to sounding your best, and Chris pulled it off and then some.  And for the review below mentioning Tim's harmony vocals being sorely lacking to the studio harmonies Chris laid down, that is just a completely incorrect statement.  Tim laid down the harmony vocals in the studio as well.  Chris sang lead while Tim sang backup/harmony on the studio CD.

Go and get this DVD, you will love it.",1129334400,2,1208,4.4363636363636365
2405177,3,B000B7QCQI,"First, I want to tell the person complaining of Chris Cornells vocals that only someone who knows nothing of live performing could make such idiotic complaints. First of all, in an outside venue with thousands of screaming people there is no way to adaquately here yourself when you are singing. All things considered, Cornells vocals are excellent, and even his worse performance is ten times what most peoples best is. The simple fact is, there are no acoustics outdoors, if you can't hear yourself sing, you can't do it like you can in a quite, accoustically sound enviroment.

What I like on this disk is the sharp image, the decent extras, the nice bonus CD (Where's the video for that???) and the concert itself filled with Soundgarden, Rage & Audioslave songs.

What I Don't like is the 16bit 48mhz stereo sound! This is a DVD, it should at least have a sub-channel. If nothing else a clean stereo mix spread over four speakers with a L/R overlap on the center chanel for a 5.1 surround mix, but nothing? Hell, VH1 Storyteller DVD's come with DTS & Dolby. In an interview they say it's all about the music, then why didn't they put the best possible sound on the disk?",1129248000,6,1175,4.617224880382775
2405178,5,B000B7QCQI,"First off 'Jay D' reviewer below is incorrect in alot of areas.  I do agree with him the 2nd Audioslave album is better than their first.  In my opinion Audioslave's first album was incredible, easily the best album of 2002.  Out of Exile is even more incredible, the song Man or Animal is so good its insane, and without a doubt will be my favorite and best of 2005.  But everything else he states is asinine.  Comparing Cornell to Ozzy is like comparing Morello to CC Deville of Poison, whats their to compare right?  This DVD is 100 %awesome.  Probably the best DVD concert release of the year.  Yeah, I'm a big Audioslave fan.  I really am, so my review is partially biased to that fact.  So what!  Chris Cornell is still the best vocalist around and certainly the most important vocalist to emerge out of the late 80's and he is still strong to this day.  He is getting old and yeah is a bit rusty through the first few songs...but remember it's live...what singer doesn't need a few songs to get all cylinders going.  The bands energy is there, and dispite the other critics, this band is on fire.  The set list is HUGE!  18 songs spanning RATM, Soundgarden and plenty of Audioslave.  The complete set list is:

Set it Off
Your time Has Come
Like A Stone
Spoonman
The Worm
Gasoline
Heaven's Dead
Doesn't Remind Me
Be Yourself
Bulls on Parade (instrumental)
Sleep Now in The Fire
Out of Exile
Outshined
Shadow of the Sun
Black Hole Sun (Chris Cornell solo)
I am the Highway
Show Me How To Live
Cochise

The bonus features is a documentary on the bands stay and performance while in Cuba.  It's a pretty lengthy feature and does show you some beautiful scenary of what Cuba offers.

This edition contains a bonus CD of ""Sessions@AOL Music"" containing exclusive performances of

Be Yourself
Loud Love
Doesnt Remind Me
Out of Exile
Sleep Now in the Fire

All-in-all, an excellent DVD release especially with the bonus CD.  Audioslave is a hard rock band, whose members dispite their past experiences, show they still have alot to offer, and as a live act, they are explosive.

Oh yeah...before I forget...to everyone complaining and whining about the bad vocals, and off synch sound and video edit...I do believe the surround sound recording is off and messed up, hence, giving us a crappy take on the concert...but if you just shut your stereo off, crank the volume up on your TV, you'll hear (and see) that it isn't the band (espeically Cornell) who sound bad or the drums being off...it's the surround sound.",1129248000,63,2513,4.595505617977528
2405179,5,B000B7QCQI,"Excellent DVD!  Although Chris Cornell can't quite produce the anger necessary to match Zack's vicious vocals, he still does a pretty good job covering RATM tunes.  All the Audioslave originals rock as much as any Audioslave fan would expect them to.  I highly recommend this DVD.  The CD is a nice bonus as well.",1129248000,2,313,4.7407407407407405
2405250,5,B000B7QCQI,"As the title says, this DVD is definitely a 'must have' item for every Audioslave fan.

This is a very important concert.

2405254,5,B000B7QCQI,"Still my favorite band of all time -- Cornell and Morello bring tears to my eyes, as I close my eyes and imagine drumming along side Wilk.  Heaven...",1261699200,,149,4.321428571428571
2405255,5,B000B7QCQI,"Awesome performance. The more I watch it the more I appreciate Tom Morello's guitar work. I used to think it was kinda gimmicky but he's really talented. I was also impressed by the bassist. Drummer, not as good as Soundgarden's drummer but still good. Chris Cornell, although not the most energitic frontman is a very good vocalist. In all a great perfomance and they sounded as good as the record.

I like the humanistic approach to the situation in Cuba. I appreciate that the band really didn't try to give much of a political message, just a look & appreciation for the Cuban people.",1249516800,,588,4.653846153846154
2405256,4,B000B7QCQI,"Although the sound quality is lacking (see other reviews) it is not terrible and in hindsight of what ultimately happened with Audioslave, this is a great video.  Tom Morello is as amazing to watch as he is to hear.  One underlying theme I couldn't shake myself of during the viewing was why the heck did Cuba get a free Audioslave concert?  Does Castro even allow their CDs into the country???",1247184000,,394,4.6
2405257,4,B000B7QCQI,"This is a great concert for Audioslave fans. They are one of my favorite bands, and this is a great concert. Audioslave plays a set of around two hours. The set is great, but Chris Cornell cannot sing Rage Against the Machine songs. Fortunately, he only attempts one.
I do wish the DVD was in 5.1. This might be a big issue for some, but I can live with it.

I was disappointed by the bonus CD, as it only contains four songs, which Audioslave played for AOL. I would have liked to have at least some of the songs from the concert, but the CD isn't bad.

All in all, if you are big Audioslave fan, you should own this. It might not be essential for more casual fans.",1239235200,,666,4.115384615384615

2405259,2,B000B7QCQI,"Seriously.  He is so high or something, that he is spaced out, he can hardly sing on key, and he has no energy during the set.  It ruined my image of Audioslave.  I really love this band but what a waste of an opportunity to do something historic.",1220918400,2,247,4.104166666666667
2405290,3,B000B7QCQI,"I love the idea of Audioslave breaking barriers in music and politics, even more so than Rage ever did.  I love the setlist considering this was before the second album was released.  The crowd energy is great.  But this DVD has no resemblance of a live performance.  I hear the band, and its all good, but I hear NO crowd noise.  None.  At all.  Barely so during the quiet parts if at all.  During Doesn't Remind Me, I could hear Chris clap more than the crowd.  If you are going to have a live DVD, I need to hear the crowd ROAR in the back channels. I love that the music sounds so crisp that you can hear the delay in the band mix from the different mikes on stage, that is kinda neat.

But make me FEEL the crowd energy.  Make me HEAR it like I'm there!",1218067200,,758,4.054054054054054
2405291,4,B000B7QCQI,"I was in this concert and they play for almost 3 hours.. there is a lot a song missing in this DVD, I wonder if there is out there the real concert with out editing.

They play all the first two discs a lot of RATM songs and Cornell did a lot of solos with his guitar. they play also with some locals o bunch of songs.

I guest they cant put it all for copyright reasons. still a good LIVE DVD to own.

Get in to Cuba to play Rock is not easy, even if you are Cuban, Behind the stage is the USA Embassy.",1211500800,,503,3.7264150943396226
2405292,2,B000B7QCQI,"1. This DVD is only in stereo. While I appreciate that it was filmed in Cuba, I still would have expected Audioslaves first DVD to be of a decent quality. I just really didn't feel that it captured their sound very well. When I compare this to some of the great DVDs (Linkin Park - Live in Texas, Coldplay live ...) - you just cant compare the sound or camera work.

I am an Audioslave fan and I was just not impressed.",1187827200,2,419,4.109756097560975

2405295,4,B000B7QCQI,Truley Shows how talented Audioslave is i will not spend my time bashing on chris for not singing the rage songs like the rage singer.. as for the rest of the dvd shows how underprivilaged the cuban ppl are and how a band from the states could probably set off a revolution. Has a great setlist from soundgarden tunes to rage tunes... this dvd could have been a little bit better with more commentary from the band but all in all good dvd not a must buy but a curiosity buy!,1166572800,,474,4.21978021978022

You would think that Chris could sing the GARDEN songs. Nope. You would think he could sing the SLAVE songs. Nope. The RAGE tunes.....NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!! Not the singer I'm used to hearing. Sorry folks.",1166486400,4,341,4.428571428571429
2405297,4,B000B7QCQI,"I love Audioslave. A band that started out as a ""supergroup"" has now evolved into a solid band with 3 solid CD's and a concert DVD that made them the first American rock band to perform in Cuba. This DVD is that show, featuring some of their biggest hits and showing off how talented and cool Audioslave is. Now, as in all concert DVD's, you have to accept that not every song is going to sound how it did on the album. Having said that, a lot of the songs differ from the versions we hear on the CD. But Chris Cornell, Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk are all in top form on this DVD. They perform the following songs:

1. Set It Off

2. Your Time Has Come

3. Like a Stone

4. Spoonman

5. The Worm

6. Gasoline

7. Heaven's Dead

8. Doesn't Remind Me

9. Be Yourself

10. Bulls on Parade

11. Sleep Now in the Fire

12. Out of Exile

13. Outshined

14. Shadow on the Sun

15. Black Hole Sun (Acoustic)

16. I Am the Highway (Semi-Accoustic)

17. Show Me How to Live

18. Cochise

All the performances are terrific, but standouts are The Worm, Spoonman,

Heaven's Dead, Bulls on Parade, Shadow on the Sun, and Cochise. These songs are the songs I have picked because they display Audioslave at the peak of their musical power. Energetic and full of talent...The Bulls on Parade track is instrumental only, but they tear it up. The weakest track on here is ""Sleep Now in the Fire,"" a Rage Against the Machine track that is a great song. Watching Chris Cornell take vocal duties from Zack de la Rocha (for the record, Cornell is a better vocalist), who is a rapper while Cornell is a singer is almost embarrassing to watch. He doesn't desecrate the song and I'm not one of those people who think that no one should sing de la Rocha's songs...But Cornell shouldn't. The concert, in case I haven't made it clear enough, is great. Not superb, not worthy of 5 stars, but great nonetheless. Also included on this DVD is the ""Out of Exile Documentary"" which follows Audioslave from getting off the plane in Cuba to the concert. Watch Chris, Brad, Tom, and Tim visit some cathedrals, parks, and places of music. Although, for me, the highlight was seeing Tim mountainbike. Not only does he fall off at one point, but his bodyguard also stops him from going down a particularly dangerous hill. And I love how he tells the camera point-blank that he doesn't like looking at churches and things. Really entertaining stuff. I'm not going to say this is a must OWN for Audioslave fans, but they should definitely check it out. It's worth the money.

2405298,3,B000B7QCQI,"Come on guys.  Do you work with different people every time you do these things?  Visual, not bad but not good.  Sound - horrid!  Reminds me of that awful Mexico City DVD as RATM.  Olympic Auditorium was amazing as a DVD.  My whole room rocks with that DVD.  I also made the stereo track into an mp3 file since the CD release sounds funny to me.  Anyway, Audioslave rocks but -

5 stars for content - minus 2 stars for poor quality",1162425600,5,431,4.158536585365853
2405299,5,B000B7QCQI,"Well, I have to say that certainly Chris's voice is not as it was when he was younger, but he is a hell of a singer still, besides the out of tune songs (which I think that would be the first three)that is always a warm up fr every singer..I have heard Cornell's voice a couple of times after this concert and sounds completely awesome!.

Also who's singing is completely perfect live? Nobody's...try you guys to sing these songs and we will talk later..",1157241600,2,454,4.404761904761905
2405324,1,B000B7QCQI,"In the last years Chris Cornell seems totally unable to deliver a decent live performance. He's always out of tune,man,in every appearance. Sometimes not so badly(but neverthless mediocre),which is the case of this concert,or even the Letterman performance,but in other situations he's dreadfully emabarassing(the Live8).Even in the AOL sessions(virtually a ""live in studio"" performance,with almost perfect acoustic around him)Chris hardly stays completely in tune for a whole song. On record,he's still amazing(to me,he's the most powerful rock singer af all time,along with Freddie Mercury)but ""live"",particularly today,I just don't know,man,he seems always uncapable to sing in tune...i have to be honest,about that,even if it really hurts me.",1154217600,4,746,6.047169811320755
2405325,1,B000B7QCQI,"I waited for ages to buy this title because I knew many people had commented on the terrible singing by Chris. In the end curiosity got the better of me and I bought it.

I wish I hadn't. It doesn't matter if this was an historic event or whether you prefer Soundgarden or Rage...the fact is that the singing is so bad it is almost unbearable. I don't even think it should have been released. Chris looks ill and his voice sounds flat and dead. The band sounds fine and the atmosphere is okay.

But for me that is not enough.",1145664000,4,525,4.188118811881188
2405326,2,B000B7QCQI,"I was pretty excited to buy this DVD seeing as how Audioslave is one of the better rock bands out there in my opinion and certainly one of the most fun to listen to. So after purchasing this DVD, whats my take on it? Musicially it's awesome but Chris Cornell just sounds haggard. He's ok on some tracks, Like A Stone was awesome and the acoustic version of Black Hole Sun as well. He's passable on most other songs, including Spoonman. But then he sounds absolutely horrible on others, including Set it Off, and the absolute worst is Gasoline. I can't even watch it thats how bad he sounds. It's disappointing that they would release a show where Chris did so poorly, just because they played it in Cuba. And for those people saying Cornell can't hit the notes anymore, you're wrong. I saw Audioslave a couple of months ago in Hartford and he sounded beyond amazing. His voice was absolutely incredible and every song he sang was perfect, which makes this dvd all the more frustrating.",1143936000,4,985,4.570621468926554
2405327,3,B000B7QCQI,I was disappointed with both the video and audio.  The quality just wasn't there.  The band looked tired and uninspired to boot.  I can only recommend to the hard-core fan that must have everything.,1141776000,,198,4.764705882352941
2405328,4,B000B7QCQI,"the criticisms of Chris Cornell's voice are pretty accurate. The more you watch it, I guess you just become accustomed to it, but he has a pretty hard time with some of those songs live. The rest of the band, however, is unbelievable. I'm amazed at how they can pull off some of the sounds live just like on the CD's. The documentary that goes along with this concert is pretty interesting, also.",1140825600,2,396,4.438356164383562

Tom Morello is a shining light in a dark tunnel surrounded by junk like Good Charlotte. The live performaces on this DVD are top notch and are just as good, if not better than their studio counterparts. I believe this group of musicians were made to play together all along and this DVD is proof of that. The highlight of this DVD is the version of ""The Highway"". During the second chorus when the entire band kicks in will send chills down your spine. Definately add this DVD to your live collection.",1139875200,4,621,4.316239316239316

2405332,3,B000B7QCQI,"The show as presented here is exciting.  The video editing is less-than-perfect, but the band including Chris Cornell sound fired up, and the audience reaction is worth seeing.  That said, the pre-show documentary was unintentionally hilarious.  Bassist Tim Commerford complaining about the lack of availability of mountain bikes in Cuba and then wishing to ""open a shop"" was a laugh-out-loud moment.  Given that he wouldn't be able to own the shop or the land one which the shop would be under a Communist system just underscores Audioslave's naivete about the Cuban totalitarian system.  Guitarist Tom Morello's complaints about the US embargo choking off Cuba's economy is probably true, but it ignores the outright confiscations and roughshod treatment of private property and civil liberties (treatment that dwarfs any US abuses, even including the recent post-9/11 years) and costs him credibility.

On a less political note, the brilliance of Cuban music and the arts - in part a result of the lack of distractions from the usual Capitalist pursuits - in acknowledged.  The Cuban duo playing in the National music school was utterly fantastic.

All of this is proof positive that despite political naivete on the part of Americans, Cubans, or even myself, music really does bridge the cultural gap, and the Audioslave visit and concert were indeed worthwhile.",1137283200,2,1366,5.2626728110599075

I don't mind rockstars being rockstars but film something where you had a great perfomance and not a crappy one. other wise I think your a studio band.

2405406,4,B000B7QCQI,"On 5/6/2005 Audioslave performed and recorded the first show by an American rock band in Cuba and this is that performance. A fairly long documentary (30 min. +) is also included on the disc that explains their reasoning behind the event and a little of the background leading up to the show. The special edition version also includes a CD containing 5 tracks recorded live by the band in a ""Sessions@AOL Music"" session.

Comparing Audioslave to both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden is expected, but people just have to realize that Audioslave is the band. It is not Rage Against the Machine with a new singer. It is not Soundgarden with a new bassist, guitarist and drummer. It is a new band of musicians who we happen to have seen before but are now playing a different repertoire of music. Most people don't know Chris Cornell also sang for Temple of the Dog, another band in 1990 on an album that was very different than Soundgarden or Audioslave.

Chris Cornell does his damnedest in this concert, but for the first two songs, he struggles with the high notes. Nearly 20 years of hard rock singing has, of course taken its toll on him and he cannot sing as high as he used to. But he is still Chris Cornell and his trademark voice shines through the performance. When the band gets to ""Like a Stone"" he really starts to sound good. Tom Morello on guitar is great, of course, demonstrating a furious array of effects and playing techniques, all dressed in a silly outfit with a vest, tie and baseball cap. The bassist and drummer likewise never miss a beat and keep the show on an even flow.

The highlight of the performance was when Cornell picked up an acoustic guitar (I didn't even know he could play!) and played the Soundgarden song ""Black Hole Sun"" by himself, then went into ""I am the Highway"" while the band picked up with him. Then finally, after playing probably their best song, ""Show me how to live"", they cut everything loose and shred, no, destroy the earth on Cuba for several minutes when they go into ""Cochise"" and their very long, free concert finally ends.

Overall it was quite a performance. Certainly the longest set I've ever seen, as they mention in the documentary. The most important thing to remember is this is a live show. This is not a studio album meant for you to listen to in the comfort of your home. This is a live show put on for the Cuban people, and all I can say is, I wish I had been there for it.",1135728000,,2452,4.466517857142857
2405407,2,B000B7QCQI,"I am reluctant to say anything negative, but something is clearly amiss with Chris Cornell and his singing. I AM a Chris Cornell fan but this performance is just plain bad. How could anyone give this performance 5 stars?!! To me, that either means you are overlooking this, out of kindness and loyalty, or you just are out of it! Yes they played Cuba, yes it was a special historic moment, but something is clearly going on with Chris. I think that either he may have blown his voice out, or it is going out. In addition, he just isn't showing himself in this performance as a very strong front man. You'd think otherwise, but he seems lost, confused, uninspired, or could it be... scared? I was scratching my head in disbelief. He just stood there doing hardly anything other than occasionally lifting his fist in the air or his mic. stand. In short, he actually looked like an amateur. Believe me, I wanted him to kick ass, I wanted my moneys worth, but it wasn't to be. The rest of the band, Tim, Todd and Brad played tight and yet, considering that this was a historic moment, that they were playing in front of 60,000 screaming Cubanos,they seemed mostly uninspired. Their faces looked mostly solemn and I wondered if they were really, in fact, having what one would think was a mind-boggling, peak experience, or whether much of their energy was taken up repressing their gnawing sense that their ""legendary"" singer was weak and blowing it and that this performance in Cuba would have been so much sweeter were they still that ground-breaking band, Rage Against The Machine and that Zack were there. I have read that Chris has a vocal coach, I hope this helps and  that he finds his voice and/or himself soon.  Otherwise, this band is nothing more than Rage with it's head cut off.",1134777600,3,1787,4.598746081504702

I realize that the version of the DVD that i purchase lacks 4 esential songs. I don`t have in this original DVD: ""Spoonman"", ""Heaven`s dead"", ""Black Hole sun"" (my favorite Soundgarden song)and ""Shadow of the sun"".

What a waste. I feel completely robbed.",1134518400,,414,4.671232876712328
2405409,5,B000B7QCQI,"This DVD is awesome, and everyone who is anyone should pick it up.  It has some of the greatest songs from each of the Audioslave DVD's, along with the top singles from Rage and Soundgarden eras.  The performance is brilliant, and the band really lives up to their name.  The live CD is an awesome extra bonus.  My only complaint is that the microphone recording isn't as loud as it should be, when compared to the rest of the instruments.  Because of this, Chris' voice will sometimes get drowned out by the bass and guitar.  Otherwise, the music is excellent!",1133740800,,561,4.56
2405410,5,B000B7QCQI,"I was actually there. I work at the US Interests Section in Cuba and saw the whole thing. It was an impressive concert and I have been to a lot of them.

Taking in consideration that they performed in CUBA they rocked. Yes some critics say the sound wasn't good. HHHMMMM? Have you ever been in Cuba? Do you know the situation they live in? They had the best equipment the Cuban government would let them use so deal with that. It's just a part of Cuba on the disk so enjoy it and stop writing idiotic things.

Buy the DVD its awesome and well worth it.

2405411,5,B000B7QCQI,"On May 6th, 2005, Audioslave became the first American rock band to play on Cuban soil and boy did they bring those lucky people a great show! Eighteen songs, evenly divided between the first Audioslave album and their latest, ""Out Of Exile,"" combined with nostalgic trips back to Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden. You really can't ask for a better performance by the guys. Honestly, I wouldn't care if this was ""Live In Delaware"" or ""Live In Vietnam,"" the actual live show is what makes this great.

Morello, Wilk and Commerford are just as professional and precise as they were in the Rage days, and although Chris Cornell's voice sounds off in the first two or three songs (he also had this problem when I saw them in concert), he still gives 100% and still pulls off a stellar performance in the end, even doing the Rage classic ""Sleep Now In the Fire"" justice (too bad he doesn't do ""Killing In The Name"" here -- that was incredible!) Although Cornell is obviously the frontman, Tom Morello tends to steal the show with his guitar in hand. The man single-handedly gives these songs their life and improvises and changes around certain guitar parts to keep us guessing. There really isn't anything this man can't do, and if you appreciate guitar playing, you will be intrigued by watching this man do his thing. Although the Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden songs serve as highlights for me, my favorite is when Chris comes out for the encore to do a solo/acoustic version of ""Black Hole Sun"" which fades into ""I Am The Highway."" This performance was equally emotional and brilliant. One of Audioslave's best songs, for sure!

As for the rest of the DVD, we get a thirty-minute documentary about the trip to Cuba, a ""TV-Version"" of the concert that you may have seen on Fuse or MTV2 and a bonus CD with 5 live songs from their Sessions@AOL ""Concert."" There is a good selection of songs on the CD, especially nice to hear ""Loud Love"" again, but Chris' voice is a bit off again, especially during ""Sleep Now In The Fire,"" which he actually handles rather well both on this DVD and when I saw them perform. Overall, it's a great buy. You get more than enough for your money, and if you were an Audioslave fan before, seeing them live may bring it to the next level. If you are someone who is still hung up on the fact that Rage Against The Machine are long-gone and the guys are doing something different, then obviously you aren't gonna like this. Don't waste your time. However, if you have an open mind and appreciate music in general, I simply tell you to enjoy.",1133395200,16,2583,4.5766738660907125
2405491,3,B000B7QCQI,"I was really excited about this. Because Chris Cornell is one of my favorites, and still is. But, I can't say that I wasn't dispointed a little bit. I've seen Audioslave live once before, and Chris didn't have any problems hitting the notes. But something wasn't quite right with this show. He had a little trouble this show. You could say that the crowd was so loud that it was hard to for him to hear if he was singing on key, I guess that could be possible, but I want to say it was something different. Anyways, if your a big Cornell fan then theirs some songs on here worth having. He does a pretty good job singing ""Spoonman"" and ""Outshined"". I never had the chance to see Soundgarden, so its nice to be able to see Chris sing them live.

And theirs some other songs he does alright on. If your a big Cornell fan then you might want to get this just for the couple Soundgarden songs they do. But if your not, then you may want to borrow it from a friend first.

I Believe that this wasn't their best show of the tour. Something wasn't going right with Chris, I know he can put on a good live show. Maybe they'll release another dvd sometime.",1132358400,4,1147,4.209090909090909
2405492,2,B000B7QCQI,"I really like Audioslave and I always liked Cornell's voice. However, this is one of the absolutely WORST performances I've EVER seen either live or on DVD! The guy just can't sing!! He's struggling to produce any high note (and they're not even really HIGH) and he's constantly out of tune. I don't think I'll watch this many more times, because I simply can't stand hearing someone singing so terribly.",1131580800,4,404,4.785714285714286
2405493,4,B000B7QCQI,"While I can't say this concert, as viewed on the deluxe DVD, is great, I can say it is damn good.  For those feeling that Cornell is not energetic enough or seems to be lacking passion, I would submit that he is a changed performer; a much more conscientious singer than when he was the frontman of Soundgarden.  Though I loved SG, he gave some of the worse vocal performances I've ever heard.  Conversely, I think that these days his principal focus is sounding 'good' and not embarrassing himself; perhaps to his detriment, depending on how one looks at it.  I, personally, am impressed with the change, which seems to also coincide with a total change in perspective, as inferred from his lyrics and the few anemic interviews I've read.  Of those interviews, a short one in Maxim (I believe)refers to his voice coach.  I think he is a better performer all around for taking such a serious tack.  And one doesn't need to jump around and writhe and go berzerk to convey emotion, either.

There are some rough spots.  I didn't particularly care for 'Black Hole...' It seemed to me that he never completely let go, and that it may have even been performed impromptu.  Towards the end of the show, he definitely shows signs of waning, but these are to his credit; younger men could not have pulled off as long a show, and displayed as much range, without withering sooner.  (Proof that Cornell has grown is his ability to expound on, and alter, the melody--something he tried but often failed at with SG.  I thought he did this beautifully with the bridge on 'Like a Stone'. ) Still, many are correct in asserting that he should not have taken on a Rage song; it was disingenous to my ear, and sounded horrible besides.

'Heaven's Dead', 'The Worm' and more or less all the Audioslave songs, were performed really well, both from a vocal and supporting band perspective.  I thought the SG songs performed were the weaker moments for CC, while his band played admirably but uninspired.  I wonder why there wasn't a longer break for the whole band, but that's a little off subject.  This was a solid, heart-felt performance, tempered, if not by the audience, then by the import of the event.  I only give it 4 stars because of the aforementioned lack of sound quality (though I'm glad the aspects of the show were not altered too much), and the somewhat spotty performance.",1131580800,2,2369,4.6291866028708135
2405494,5,B000B7QCQI,"I would label myself as someone that likes all form of music, but my favorite genres have always been Rock and Classic Rock. Audioslave does not let thier fans down with this dvd. An hour and a half of a great rock music performance and a interesting documentary about their trip to Cuba make for one sweet dvd. There is a great acoustic solo by Chris Cornell of ""Black Hole Sun"" and half of ""I Am The Highway"" is also an acoustic solo by Cornell. The instrumental version of ""Bulls On Parade"" is a great one to jump around and bang your head to. It also comes with a bonus CD with a few songs off their Yahoo! Live Session which is an extra nice bonus. Overall it is one of the best live performances I have ever heard, has enormous replay value, and is great to just have running for backround noise while you work around the house. It does not dissapoint. This DVD ""Doesn't Remind Me"" of anything that can compare to Audioslave and won't be ""Outshined"" by any other live performance DVD anytime soon. BUY IT!",1130716800,,1011,4.354497354497354
2405495,5,B000B7QCQI,"For a place condemned by the U.S. government as an oppressed, hostile government, a lot of artists sure go to Cuba. Ry Cooder discovered the world-famous Buena Vista Social Club there and has recorded a string of hit albums on the island, soccer idol Maradona practically lives there and filmmaker Oliver Stone shot two documentaries in the country focusing on Fidel Castro. Now Audioslave add their voice to the growing chorus of people wondering exactly why this place is so banished by the United States. In a historic moment for rock, Audioslave become the first American band to ever play Cuba and this DVD not only captures their exciting performance but also provides a look into a lively culture that has a lot to offer. The concert itself is pure Audioslave, raw, smart and never boring. Fans of the band's previous incarnations, Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine, will be delighted to find a few classic tunes here like ""Spoonman"" which doesn't lose any of it's war chant and ""Sleep Now In The Fire"" which Chris Cornell elevates to a higher level of rage. The acoustic ""Black Hole Sun"" is a pleasant moment but it's the Audioslave catalogue that steals the show with burning performance of ""Gasoline,"" ""Cochise,"" ""Like A Stone"" and new songs like the U2ish ""Doesn't Remind Me"" with it's southern gospel vibes and the poetic ""Out Of Exile"" which perfectly goes with the occasion with Cornell singing of being exiled in an island out in the sea. The most valuable contribution of the DVD as a whole is the documentary about the band's trip through Cuba where they see the culture, meet the people and ask questions as to why this island is so barked at when the people seem to living fine, except of course by the poverty imposed by the embargo. Guitarist Tom Morello even jams with some local Cuban musicos and what would a documentary featuring the ex members of Rage be without a shot of Che Guevara's face gracing a Cuban high rise? The extra CD, taken from the AOL Sessions series is a fun little extra with some good performances that show-off the band's skills. However, underneath all the rock n' roll, there is a real sense of exploring other cultures, realizing just how cut off we can be from other countries and how music, art can be a bridge that can fill the gap between people, between a continent and an island.",1130630400,,2342,4.700729927007299
2405496,5,B000B7QCQI,"Im a really big fan of audioslave so something like this is a real treat for me. It was a real ballsy move they made but it wokred out beautifully. They rocked those cuban's asses. Great Job guys. Here a rating of the individual performances:

Set it off-(10/10)- Awesome way to get an amazing show started. They play this song perfecly and give the crowd a start to a grand show.

Your Time has come-(10/10)- This was a brand new song, but they sounded like theyve been playin it for years. Morellos Solo work is baffiling.

Like a stone-(10/10)-They take a time out from playing hard rock to perform this Great ballad. Again Morello has beautiful art work while the rest of the band lays out a thick canvas for him and cornell to roar over.

Spoonman-(10/10)-I honestly think they play soungarden songs beter then soundgarden did. Morello is much much better then the other guitarist. Timmys backing voclas are really awesome.

The Worm-(10/10)- This was their first time playin this song and they rocked it Non stop. Greatness like a worm.

Gasoline-(10/10)- This song could get your grandma going. Every note on this song was perfect. An Audioslave classic.

Heavens Dead-(10/10)- Another first time song that they performed flawlessly. Cornell definitly sings this one at his best.

Doesnt remind me-(8/10)- Instrumentally this song was perfect but I had to take off for cornell here. He was just a little off on this song, but morello made up for it with his thrashing solo and timmys yet again awesome backing vocals.

Be Yourself-(9/10)- Done pretty well but not an outstanding performce of the night.

Bulls on parade/Sleep now in the fire-(10/10)- Bulls on parade is amazing. Morello's refined solo blew me away. He does the Scratching solo along will some thrashing as well. Then when they start up on Sleep now in the fire, the crowd exploded. Ive never seen that many cubans goin nuts before....Well, except for the final scene of scarface.

Out of exile-(10/10)- I was blown away by this one. Everything was yet again perfect. Timmys backing vocals, were YET AGAIN awesome.

Outshined-(10/10)-As i said before, they do it better then the people who done it(except cornell of course).

Shadow on the sun-(7/10)- This performance goin good until at the end where cornell was running in small circles on the stage like a pissed off 3rd grader. Cornell, you're better then that man.

Black Hole Sun- (10/10)- I really enjoyed this. Cornell take his acoustic guitar and does this one on a solo. I like how it leads into the next song.....

I Am The Highway-(11/10)- This is the best performance of the night. The first two verses cornell is solo, the then rest of em come in and blow everyone away. Morellos solo is soulful and Kick ass.

Show me How to live-(9/10)- Good perfomance. You could see that cornell was tiring but he gave 100%.

Cochise-(10/10)- Best way to end off the show. A heavy hitting guitar riff in a havana night. I like it.

BONUS CD*

 Live AOL sessions

THIS IS A CD NOT A DVD

Be yourself-(8/10)- I really don't like these AOL sessions but hey sounded ok.

Loud love-(10/10)- I never heard this song before, and when i listened to it I fell in love. LOUD LOVE!

Doesnt remind me-(10/10)- SOunded better then on live in cuba.

Out of exile-(10/10)-Pretty much just as good as Live in cuba version.

Sleep now in the fire-(10/10)- Just as good as LIC.

Final words:

You must get this DVD. You will cherish it forever. I know I will. This was historic event that will be remebered forever. Especially in cuba. Now saw hello to my little friend.....just playin.",1130544000,,3592,4.7223113964687
2405497,5,B000B7QCQI,"I've read ALL the other reviews and I have to laugh at how anal and sad some of you critics are.  Only Melanie B sums it up best - the band is Audioslave, not Soundgarden and expecially not Rage.  I've also seen all of the above bands more than a few times and LIVE IS NOT MEMOREX PEOPLE...  IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THAT IS BAD OR GOOD DEPENDING ON WHETHER ""YOUR"" EXPECTATIONS ARE MET OR WHETHER YOU WERE WISE ENOUGH TO GO WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATIONS.  I just saw'em live in Bakersfield and they were great!

I've watched the DVD a few times now before making my critique and just like a good ablum it gets better each time because I'm getting used to what's new and what is not the same as their albums.  IT IS TRUE THOUGH THAT CORNELL SHOULD NOT BE SINGING ZACK'S LYRICS, ONLY A WANNABE-MIMIC COULD PULL THAT OFF WELL AND CORNELL IS POSSIBLY THE FURTHEST VOCALIST FROM THAT.  They shouldn't even be playing Soundgarden stuff either...  I would rather hear all Audioslave because all their songs are great.  You know, they are actually only even playing those old songs to try to please so many of you whiners out there and that is just ironic and quite hilarious that you are the same people that complain.  PLUS, THEY ARE OLDER NOW AND DIFFERENT AND THOSE OTHER BANDS ARE GONE, SO I CAN REALLY SEE HOW SO MANY [unoriginal] PEOPLE OUT THERE WOULD BE SO BOTHERED THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED OR THAT THE OLDER PAST SONGS WERE NOT PERFECT.  It's a good show, especially if you like Audioslave and it is definately worth $15.  BUT IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE ANAL-WHINING TYPES THEN SORRY, IT'S TRUE, YOU MAY NOT BE SO IMPRESSED, BUT ALTLEAST YOU'LL BE HAPPY THAT YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT!

2405498,5,B000B7QCQI,"THE BAND IS AUDIOSLAVE, NOT ""RAGE"" OR SOUNDGARDEN!!!

THE DVD IS GREAT, BUT 2ND BEST TO SEEING THEM LIVE!!!

DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION OR RESPECT TO ANY WANNABE CRITICS WHO SAY CORNELL OR THE DVD IS NOT GOOD!  THEIR ATTITUDE AND HEAD ARE SHOVED ELSEWHERE!

I've seen Audioslave once, SoundGarden 3x, and Rage once. Audioslave was surprisingly good because I didn't really expect them to sound too good live. Sound Garden was excellent 2x and not so good once, while Rage [Zack and Tom actually] sucked and was blown off the stage by Tool and Primus because I really expected Rage to sound better [more studio like, my mistake!].  Sometimes songs that sound great in the studio don't sound so good live and yet others that aren't that great on the cd are excellent live.  But I still love all the bands to this day and have all their cd's. ONLY FOOLS JUDGE NEGATIVLEY WHEN EXPECTATIONS ARE NOT MET!  With a band as powerful as Audioslave, Cornell must yell a bit louder when live [the same was true with SoundGarden] AND [to all you out there that expect studio sound] Cornell's microphone absorbs the sound of the show [music, echoes and crowd] as well as his voice, making it sound ""NOT AS PERFECT"" as when he is alone in the studio experimenting with what sounds best! [Just listen to how good he sounds when the band is playing quietly or when Cornell sings alone with his guitar only!]  The instruments have their own line so they usually sound flawless unless a player is off and they were all ON in this show! And to the clowns that say Cornell's performance was lackluster...  have you ever seen him live before [I HAVE 4x], once again what were you expecting?  He sings, he doesn't jump around [anymore] to make a statement or add impact.  The only gripe I have for the show is that I feel they should have left the old groups' music alone and focused only on Audioslave.  The band has too much good music and it is true that Cornell cannot recapture Zack's voice or impact, but he's not bad, just a little different. Cornell is such a better singer in everyway and Audioslave is a much more professional and versatile band than Rage ever was [they were good at just one thing, their sound and that's why they faded away even as good as they were. Zack's yelling and inability to grow or change got old!  It was the best thing for the band that he left and you can see their enthusiasm to do something new with one of the best rock singers in history in every interview they do!  The Soundgarden songs they played were good, but once again unnecessary because there are too many good Audioslave songs. GET THE CD, IT IS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN $15!  Unless you expect something that the DVD is not, like it seems a few fools always do.",1130457600,,2738,4.458917835671342
2405499,5,B000B7QCQI,Oh man. As soon as I see the new Audioslave live DVD. I bought it without even looking at it. I played it in my PS2 right after I got  it. It's another concert that would make you jump even you're alone at home. Chris screamed all the way in the concert...lol..his screaming voice is funny. Tom's guitar performance is not bad in the show. Get a thousand of copies and give it to your friends and family. I bet this DVD would rock their houses!!!,1130371200,,446,4.186046511627907
2405549,2,B000B7QCQI,"I was excited for this DVD because I've never had the chance to see Audioslave (or Rage) live and I've been a fan of their music.  After watching the DVD I honestly can't believe the band actually released a show with such a horrendous vocal performance from Chris Cornell.  I've always considered Chris one of the top rock vocalists, but he is awful on this DVD.  He is truly painful to listen to, especially since the band sounds so good.

Audioslave should be ashamed to release this DVD.",1130371200,2,491,4.545454545454546
2405550,2,B000B7QCQI,"First of all, I must agree with those who complain about Cornell's performance; except for ""Show Me How to Live"" and maybe ""Cochise,"" his vocals are plain embarrassing. And Mr. Cornell, please don't ever try to rap/scream/shout/sing/impersonate Zack de la Rocha again. Ever. ""Sleep Now in the Fire"" will go down in history as one of the worst cover versions ever. ""Bulls On Parade"" is, however awesome. Any ideas why? Cornell doesn't sing.

Which brings me to my second point: The rhythm section is absolutely spot-on. Morello, Wilk, and Commerford are the tightest backing band one could ask for. I only wish I had been forewarned that the version of ""Spooonman"" only appears on the deluxe DVD. That version would have been worth seeing. A shame.

As a band though, Audioslave seem uninspired. All the originality in the music came from the Rage members. Cornell doesn't seem to have much to contribute to the mix, as Soundgarden weren't terribly original in the first place. (Don't get me wrong. I love Soundgarden. They just didn't do much to progress music as a whole. Rage Against the Machine practically created an entire genre.)

Anyone who has seen Rage's Mexico City DVD will know what I'm talking about when I say that Audioslave's performance as a whole pales in comparison. It's not just the difference in frontman either. The entire band seems inspired when they are behind De la Rocha, and that same inspiration shows when Audioslave plays a Rage cover, but then Cornells has walk on, looking very lackluster, and ruin it. If you don't believe me, find a copy of that Rage performance and watch ""Freedom,"" the set finale. You will not be disappointed.

I hate to ""rage"" against the mighty Chris Cornell, but his performance on this DVD just ruins any value one might wish to find in such a recording. This performance was indeed historical, but it was just plain bad.",1130025600,4,1881,4.832298136645963

Cause the DVD I purchased is missing the songs, Spoonman, Heaven's Dead, Shadow On The Sun, and Black Hole Sun. All of which I would have REALLY liked to hear. The case doesn't mention that there's another COMPLETE version available anywhere, so I'm very disappointed in the poor advertising.

2405553,3,B000B7QCQI,"Even though I've only seen a few of the songs from this DVD, I felt I wanted to write a response to some of the reviews I've read thus far.

First off... I am a singer by trade, and have been singing rock with a band for years now, and am a student of music and vocal performance. That being said, I believe there is no excuse for a professional singer to go off key. I've seen Cornell live twice, and countless TV performances. He is a very inconsistant singer. Some shows, he is on key the entire way, as well as a very enigmatic, energetic frontman (i.e. an Audioslave performance earlier this year in Austin, TX... or Live on Broadway). However, I have also seen/heard him go pathetically off key (i.e. ""Like a Stone"" on Live8). Just because you are a fan of the band, I don't think you can give him a pass on this. He's a moody, manic sort of personality. It just depends on which Chris Cornell you get that day.

I hate when fans of a certain band eat out of their hands and refuse to see their shortcomings. If on this DVD he was bad, then his fans should call him on it. After all, Audioslave is a product... and we have the right to demand a solid product of them.",1129852800,4,1173,4.1629955947136565

Just waiting for it to get here in the mail. lol  Anyways, I can still tell you how freaking Amazing they are to see live. An amazing is probably an understatement. I'm dead serious.  I just saw them in concert this past tuesday, (oct 19) in Coral Cables, FL at the Univeristy of Miami Convocation Center. Oh my gosh, words can't even describe how good this show was. These guys are unlike any other rock band.

I had front row seats and to see them that close live singing all there amazing powerful rock tunes was an absolute privlege! There was so much energy the whole entire time and the fun never stopped.  Everyone was jumping up and down the whole time, there were mosh pits, everything! lol  They opened up with ""Your Time Has Come,"" from there latest album Out of Exile which was an excellent choice to open with.  They sang most of there hits from there first album such as like a stone, iam the highway, cohise, and set it off. Man, when they played Set It Off, that made me just realize that was the best rock concert I had been to in my life and it always will be.

Oh, and at the end, they said goodnight to us and left and it got dark, and whattya know, they come back out and sing Rage Against The Machine's ""Killing In The Name.""  And that about made everyone in the damn building the happiest people ever.

Seriously, if it wasn't for Audioslave, rock would be dead as a doornail. That's right, DEAD!!  Audioslave has so much talent.  They were born and destined to be rockstars and they sure have shown it.  I advise you, if you haven't yet, GO SEE THEM LIVE!!! And if you can't, unfortuntley, purchase this DVD right away.

As a testament to progressive socio-political change, Audioslave's performance cannot be faulted.

However, upon watching the concert footage, one is immediately struck by the absolutely abysmal vocal performance delivered by Chris Cornell. We are all well aware that Cornell ranks among the most talented vocalists in rock history, yet his Havana performance is exceptionally weak for an artist of his caliber...to call it substandard would be an understatement. Cornell's vocals, once the epitome of power and lush timbre, are atrociously strained and forced throughout the Havana show. Cornell appears nervous and uncharacteristally dissociative, as if he is struggling to maintain some semblance of pitch while his mind drifts to other places. This is simply not the same Chris Cornell that I have witnessed live. Sole vocal highlights include ""Gasoline"" and ""Cochise."" The vast majority of selections are nearly unsalvageable due to Cornell's pitch discrepancies and hesitancy. Even his physical posture is indicative of disinterest. Nobody can expect perfection, but this performance is reminiscent of bad karaoke (see ""Sleep Now in the Fire).

And now, the band. The former members of Rage Against the Machine are, as per usual, absolutely stunning. Morello's solos are jaw-dropping, and the rhythm section of Brad and Tim are as solid as ever. These three musicians are perhaps the tightest, most powerful instrumental foundation in rock music during the last 20 years. Soundgarden material is covered exceptionally well, especially ""Spoonman.""

Altogether, not a bad investment for Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine completists. Played loud enough, it does the trick. I'm sure a plethora of Cuban fans can thank a large dose of adrenaline for their failure to hear the flaws in Cornell's performance. Cornell does a marginally better job on the accompanying AOL Live CD, with a great rendition of ""Doesn't Remind Me."" Better luck next time, Chris.",1129593600,4,2407,5.5710382513661205
2405557,3,B000B7QCQI,"I love Chris Cornell. He is to me, an icon, a legend, a singer and lyricist of the highest caliber. Soundgarden, Temple of the dog, his awesome solo stuff, and of course Audioslave.  I am not really a big fan of Rage, like it but don't love it.

I'll get to the point: Chris Cornell's vocals are so forced and uncomfortable, it makes this dvd heartwrenching to watch.  As far as the other reviewers, Jd is spot on and these other guys are just wrong.  The bass player def. does NOT sing on the album, all it takes is a simple listen to hear that, and i'm not even hating on his backups, he's not a singer to begin with.  Also, crowd noise? Are you serious??  He has an IN EAR MONITER not to mention the HUGE moniters in front of him and the whole stage.  He can hear himself fine- his voice sounds great when he is singing mellow, it's when he attempts his octave spanning screams that things get really ugly.

And for the record, Chris Cornell should NEVER, EVER do a Zack De la Rocha impression, ever again. Ever. Sleep now in a fire is soooo bad, I can't even watch it again.

To the person who said every singer needs a couple songs to warm up- when exactly is he warmed up?  Because upon a third watching, I have determined that there are about 3 songs where his voice isn't just plain bad.  Not to mention the fact that this guy is in front of that many people and he's just standing there most of the time.  Yes, I know to retain good breath control you shouldn't move around, but that never stopped him in Soundgarden when he wasn't so OLD.  Come on, I love Cornell, he's in my top 3 singers ever, but let's all be realistic, his voice sounds so shredded he's lost almost all of his high end!!

High points (there are some!)

-All around Tom Morello, fantastic performance, doesn't miss a beat, unbelievable replication of his efeects live, seamless guitar tone switching, energetic stage show...he ROCKS.

-Outshined...one of the only songs Cornell appears to loosen up and actually FEEL while he's singing, not just stand there and concentrate hard on hitting whatever note he's trying to reach, great performance by the band as well.

-Show me how to live...decent Cornell the whole way through, great live demonstration of the cool vocal trick at the end of the song, this 5 second clip made the whole purchase worth it to me!

-Very cool documentary about the band in Cuba

I don't have the deluxe edition with the extra songs and whatever else, so there it is.

Audioslave one of the best hard rock bands today?  Absolutely.  How are they live?  Not that great.

2405558,5,B000B7QCQI,"First of all, I would just like to make a complaint to Jay D.  You obviously know nothing about Audioslave or music DVD's.  You really have no right to call Chris ""old"".  He is a wonderful singer and a great man.  Now, onto the review. What a great review this is.  It was great to share a part in seeing the first ever concert played by an American rock band in Cuba.  Some of my favorite performances on this DVD are....

  Bulls on Parade

  Sleep now in the fire

  Black Hole Sun

  Cochise

  Outshined

  Spoonman

  Show me how to live

What a great buy for any rock fan!",1129420800,3,579,4.111111111111111
8082980,5,B000B7QCQI,"LOVE IT!! Great band and a great, historical concert. DVD has an awesome little documentary of the band's trip to Cuba that's pretty long (and a good watch in itself). I had ordered this DVD just for the concert without really reading into any special features, so that was a nice surprise.

The bonus CD is pretty good too. I never knew it existed before now. It's got Audioslave singing their stuff, as well as some Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine stuff. I'm not big into live CD's, but hearing them do some of their previous bands stuff was unique enough to make it a must have for me.

The only negative for me is that this isn't offered in HD format (to my knowledge). It'd be great to have this on Blu-Ray instead of DVD.",1501977600,,736,4.364963503649635

8082985,5,B000B7QCQI,"As previously read, I understand why there is concern about sound and Cornells voice. I think he got much better as the show went on, with that being said overall sound is decient. Listening to the almost decade old show on dvd is tough at times considering how much sound has progressed with personal sound in home. I would say that although I watched through recently upgraded sound system (kilpsch reference series + receiver ) it's easy to pick out the bad. Overall , great show, killer crowd and great experience . Bravo audioslave !",1459296000,,538,4.673684210526316
