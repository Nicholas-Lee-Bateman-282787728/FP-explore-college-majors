1360398,4,B00004W0SC,"A powerful movie, very well made and subtly acted.  None of the actors can be faulted.  Even the King of Mercia (portrayed with just a little too much ham, and with a startling accent from somewhere between Birmingham and Northumbria) grows on you by the end of his scenes. The camerawork is lush and inventive, with plenty of amazing location shots. The costuming and music are both excellent.  The Vikings are terrifyingly depicted, and sound is used very intelligently in conveying the fear they inspired.  The script and dialogue is intelligent, conveying something of both the religious politics of the period and the emotional tensions of life in the Dark Ages. The 'permissive' hippy era of 1969 gives the film makers an excuse for gore and portrayals of Viking cruelty, but it's very muted compared to how a modern movie would have approached it. The 1960s costuming and style of the female lead is really the only element which dates the movie to the late 1960s, and otherwise it has very aged well. The love aspects are cleverly portrayed, and are not allowed to bog the movie down. For historical truth the movie may be shaky, but it's a good tale that's well told.  Toward the end we even get a nod toward the fact that Anglo-Saxon women were not all blushing maids and serving wenches, which was probably quite advanced for such a prejudiced time as 1969. For some reason this movie is totally unavailable on Amazon UK, and only available as an old VHS tape in the USA. Possibly the music rights have expired and are too expensive to renew?  I'd welcome a good clean DVD transfer of this movie.",1341273600,4,1607,4.680851063829787
1360399,5,B00004W0SC,"I saw this as a boy only twice that I can remember (once it was a 'late movie' and I stole into the living room with everyone else asleep to watch it with the sound off!). It was one of those movies that fired the imagination in a youngster, and as others have said, I would really like the chance to see it again.

As a kid there were two movies that really stuck with me. One was 'the Long Ships', and this was the other one. At one time Amazon had this thing where you could vote for movies you'd like to see put on dvd. I wish this movie had won that honor.

As far as the film goes, I remember David Hemmings torn between wishing to spend a life devoted to God and his responsibilities as ruler of a country constantly under harrassment by foreign invaders. Probably the scene I remember best was the shield wall by the water. Some awesome stuff there.

If it was available I would certainly buy it!",1320192000,7,904,4.154285714285714
1360400,4,B00004W0SC,I concur with the previous reviewers remarks.  I saw this film as a teenager and thought it was very well done.  I would love to see it again and see how it holds up.  I recall Micheal York playing a chilling Viking warload and steals the show.  Odd how some films never make to DVD.,1305072000,5,283,4.090909090909091
1360401,5,B00004W0SC,"This is one of the most romantic movies ever.  I used to watch it annually on television.  I have been trying to obtain a copy of it, but cannot find a way.  At least Amazon.com has a listing for it.  I hope Amazon can get the manufacturer to re-release.",1230163200,20,254,4.122448979591836
1360432,3,B00004W0SC,Film was OK but quality of pciture was poor,1484092800,2,43,3.888888888888889
1360433,4,B00004W0SC,"I saw this film when it first came out (ever so briefly) in 1969, at the age of 14, and thoroughly enjoyed it. But it was savaged by critics, disappeared for decades, and has only now resurfaced thanks to Warner Archive. The question for me when I ordered a copy was, how well would it hold up after all that time?

Surprisingly, it holds up quite well for me ... and not merely because of fond boyhood memories, either. True, it's an uneven film to be sure, clunky at times, and hardly historically accurate in major respects. But it gets the dismal & raw look of the times just right, with its ""towns"" being little more than a few stone & wooden buildings encircled by a crude wooden stockade, with even the nobles looking quite scruffy. In fact, one of the things I like about it now is that the people look like people, not ripped & sculpted cartoons with six-pack abs; the battles look clumsy, brutal, ugly, rather than perfectly choreographed.

For many modern viewers, the film will be slow & talky. It's not so much an epic action film as a study of human beings struggling to live with their passions, and sometimes being overwhelmed by them. Alfred (David Hemmings)  is presented as an educated man about to take holy orders when he's summoned to defend Wessex against the invading Danes. He's a complex figure, intelligent & even arrogant at first, but deeply disgusted by his own entirely human feelings. Guthrum (Michael York) is leader of the Danes, the embodiment of a smart, worldly man who embraces the joys of the flesh. The ongoing struggle between the two men is in many ways an externalization of Alfred's inner struggle to balance intellect & piety against anger & desire.

It's also very much a film of its own time, the 1960s, which also was marked by that same interior struggle. Period films from the 1960s have a certain look, a certain lighting, a certain tone that I've always found striking. Their characters tend to be both of the historical period depicted & contemporary; ""Alfred the Great"" is no exception. This may well be an acquired taste for many younger viewers, which is understandable. But there's also the treat of seeing a very young Ian McKellan in one of his first roles, as the marsh bandit who aids Alfred. Even then he displayed charm & wit & presence!

As historical period piece, it aspired to the first rank but is clearly second-tier. If you can accept that, then there's still much to be enjoyed here: the battle sequences, the little details, the personal drama. With that in mind, recommended!",1484006400,9,2548,4.665924276169265
1360434,5,B00004W0SC,"Don't know how accurate the film is historically, but I enjoyed the film.",1482624000,2,73,4.6923076923076925

1360436,5,B00004W0SC,"One of the few movies about Anglo Saxon England, and wonderfully acted at that. The story is not historically accurate, for instance Alfred did not leave church orders to become king. But what the heck. Loved it when it came out forty years ago and ordered just to see it again.",1481414400,6,278,4.470588235294118
1360437,3,B00004W0SC,"The story was certainly an interesting one but I have to admit it moved way to slow to have held my interest for any length of time. Alfred the Great was definitely one of England's most interesting periods of time however that did not translate to the screen. I have to admit, also that even the battle scenes were dull and Alfred was one of Britain's best strategists ever. The story is fine as is all the performances, particularly David Hemmings as Alfred. He was a pious man who never wanted to be King but it happened. if you are a fan of sweeping Historic epics, then go for it but if you are looking for more than dialog and story...you should pass.",1475712000,4,657,4.349593495934959
1360438,5,B00004W0SC,"My fascination with Alfred the Great came about from watching The Last Kingdom on Netflix, which refers to Wessex, the last kingdom not conquered by the Danes in 9th Century England.  I absolutely loved this film and its portrayal of Alfred as a reluctant leader and king, well acted by David Hemmings, whom I only remembered from his disagreeable role as Mordred in Camelot (1967).  Also look for Michael York as Guthrum, leader of the Danes, and a very young Ian McKellen, in his pre-Gandalf days as Roger, one of the outlaws.  The film-making is well done, with beautifully shot scenes as Galway fills in for ancient England.  There's a real 1960's vibe from the main actors, and the hair styles and wardrobe are reminiscent of both 869 and 1969.  It was supposed to have been a flop when it premiered in theaters.  That won't stop me from recommending it to lovers of historically based drama.",1474243200,6,897,4.717948717948718
1360439,1,B00004W0SC,The worst B movie I have seen.  Wish I could get my money back,1473465600,,62,3.4285714285714284
1360440,4,B00004W0SC,So glad this is finally getting a DVD release! I had an old copy from TV on VHS tape. I enjoy epic films from this time period. Good roles for David Hemmings and Michael York in their prime and it's fun to see a very young Ian McKellan in a minor role.,1470268800,4,252,3.8653846153846154
1360441,5,B00004W0SC,"I saw this when I was in junior high in the 1970s. I want to see it again! It made a big impression and I sure wish I could find it so I could share it with my friends. Michael York was fabulous in this movie. It was just the most perfect movie ever made from what I remember. To the studio that produced it, please release it!!!",1355702400,5,329,3.8529411764705883

7924661,4,B00004W0SC,I saw this on late night tv in the early seventies and loved it so much I cut my hair like the main character...Seeing it decades later it was good but I wasn't an impressionable wee teen anymore. Worth owning though...,1513555200,,219,4.365853658536586
7924662,5,B00004W0SC,"This is Hollywood's version of one of the greatest men in English history.  Great movie and has some historically correct information but most of the plot is pure Hollywood.  The end of the movie show the battle tactics that Alfred actually used, and shows why the  shield wall actually stopped the Vikings (in a lot of battles).",1512950400,,329,4.7368421052631575
7924663,5,B00004W0SC,"I owned this film on VHS and transferred to DVD. VHS clarity was poor and screen ratio was 4:3. This DVD is much better quality and in Widescreen. I had been searching for a DVD version for years. I saw the film in a Theatre and purchased the VHS shortly thereafter. One of my fav historical films. Alfred is the only English King called ""The Great,"" and he is the reason that we speak English today.",1503964800,,400,4.276315789473684
7924664,5,B00004W0SC,"I saw this terribly neglected, underrated film at a small cinema in Denver, Colorado, some time following its international release. There were half a dozen patrons there. I was friendly with the projectionist, who loved Erich W Korngold's music. I spotted him in the lobby. ""What did you think about the music""?, he inquired. ""It's the only reason I came to see the film"", I responded. He related for me spotting the then conductor [was it Brian Priestman?] of the Denver Symphony Orchestra in the lobby at an earlier screening. I suspect that he, too, came for the same reason. Raymond Leppard's superb score is a memorable one, worthy of repeated hearings.",1503014400,,659,4.892857142857143
7924665,2,B00004W0SC,"Why introduce so many inaccuracies when they are not needed.  This is a great story and still needs to be told.  Edward for example was not Alfred's first child.  His wife was never called the queen.  Alfred had been fighting along side his brothers as the designated heir since he was 16 at least and possibly earlier.  His wife was never traded to the Danes.  He ""won"" in other ways - by converting one Dane ruler to Christianity.  The shield wall was NOT his invention - the Danes had been using it for quite some time.  Alfred kept the Danes from the easy victories then had been having by building a series of fortification where the population could retreat and defend themselves better.  The life of Alfred the Great, his warrior daughter and son and what he accomplished could be the topic of several great movies, but make them accurate please.",1499990400,7,853,4.596026490066225
7924666,1,B00004W0SC,"I remember liking this movie a lot. Unfortunately, this DVD reproduction is so dark I can't see the people most of the time. After 20 minutes of obscure, shadowy movements, I gave up.",1495238400,3,183,4.575757575757576
7924667,5,B00004W0SC,"I am extremely happy that this movie has become available to collectors of historical epic's!!!  While this may not be 100% accurate to history very few movie's dealing with historical events are!  I can't believe "" Alfred The Great"" has not prompted more film efforts.  He is a pretty important element in the history of Britain uniting a country that was even more divided than the movie portrays.  I love these epics from the 50's & 60's with there bold use of color & opulent sets & costume design...actually they kind of keep this epic closer to reality with less flashy clothing & people that actually get dirt on them. While I can't say this is high adventure it certainly takes you on a roller coaster ride through the range of human emotions...much like Shakespeare. But I don't want you to go away thinking this has no action because there are quite a few well choreographed battle scenes.  I never got to see this one as a kid so it was a complete treat for me being a huge fan of historical films & anything to do with sword play & pre gun battle sequences.  I love the way Alfred a scholar makes use of the ancient Greek falanks  you will have to excuse my spelling on that one.  But it is amazing that this ancient battle technique would resurface again & again through out history saving the day for many men that would become legends for their countries like William Wallace adding great long spears & mobilizing the falanks calling it a Shiltron .  But back to this movie!  It played just fine with a beautiful clear picture & sound quality, apparently this movie was well kept all these years or someone did a great job restoring it!!!  It comes with the original poster art ( I Think) in a nice solid case & I feel I got my money's worth.  This is a great addition to my collection as like I said there isn't much out there about Alfred the Great!!!",1494892800,,1868,4.41399416909621
7924668,2,B00004W0SC,"Okay film, but did not seem focused on the man nor the accomplishments of the same. I watched the film and will see it again; however, nothing came from the film to truly recommend it to anyone",1488326400,2,193,4.243243243243243
