8525444,3,B0085AXTYQ,"I have seen many recordings of Falstaff and always feel the key to success is to somehow imply the Elizabethan ENGLISH nature of the story. Verdi made this wonderfully possible in his score despite it all being in Italian and a number of notable singers have brought the meat of the opera to the fore brilliantly, notably Geraint Evans all those years ago! The role of Sir John Falstaff is of course critical.
I compared this with the Glyndebourne recording with Christopher Purves and felt this production was too Teutonic. Falstaff was depicted as a grubby slob, a schmock, which of course he was but he still had those false illusions of being an English Lord. This production gave little or no hint of being English at all and just trundled out the score, well sung but without any English character. Sir John could have been anyone. For me it fell flat. It could just as easily have been set in Zurich, (which it was of course) and it looked like it. I blame the production and the costumes in most part which had little or no English feel at all. I thought the Glyndebourne production was a bit odd too with its military WWII setting but it was aimed in the right direction and could not possibly have been anything but English. This is not an easy opera to get right as it must bring several key elements together. This performance was not right to my mind but it might please others not bothered by Sir John's portrayal as it is well played and recorded. It just lacks that buffo Lordly English touch.",1347494400,3,1509,4.510948905109489
