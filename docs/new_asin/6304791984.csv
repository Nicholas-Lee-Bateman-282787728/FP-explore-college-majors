7877635,5,6304791984,"This third collection of Kavanagh Q.C. continues to establish John Thaw's character of a Northern boy done well and expands the role in terms of the variety of cases that the lawyer comes up against.
For those who are not familiar with the series, John Thaw (Sweeney, Inspector Morse) plays a Northern born barrister in chambers in London fighting whatever case he is offered with the same customary diligence and thoughtfulness that we have become used to in his years of portrayal of Morse and now Kavanagh.
Kavanagh Q.C. is a fine vehicle within which to explore the British class structure. Working class boy made good, marries middle class woman and is employed in a middle/upper class profession where everyone smiles even while the dagger slides between the ribs. The class conflicts are exposed for all to see and the series is full of nuance and semantics about Britain's pervasive class system.
This collection includes three eighty minute episodes. A Sense of Loss shows Kavanagh defending a case of a juvenile accused of the murder of a policewoman who had befriended him. The youth is hostile and resists any attempts to help while the local constabulary blunder around with minds already made up. Ultimately Kavanagh uncovers the key to the mystery and discovers a surprising result.
In a Stranger in the Family, a case of a work related personal injury to a young man brings difficult circumstances to himself and his family. In his prosecution of the case he uncovers a web of lies, deceipt and blackmail to avoid the truth becoming known and ultimately realises success for his client only after another family tragedy has been exposed.
Finally, Job Satisfaction finds Kavanagh successfully defending a brother and sister accused of murdering the father and stepmother. After the siblings are aquitted, Kavanagh faces a difficult time as he is harrassed by an upset family member convinced of their guilt while having to try to deal with personal difficulties of ailing parents who live far away. The truth ultimately wins out and another tragedy narrowly averted as the killer is exposed and finally arrested for another crime. For Kavanagh there is family loss and he must come to terms with his own grief.
Three gripping and well made episodes which bear repeated watchings. Lots in them too for the student of British society.",1015459200,5,2347,4.989795918367347
