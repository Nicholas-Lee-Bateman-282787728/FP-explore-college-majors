Many famous movies, TV series and characters not included in this compilation",1169769600,4,104,5.117647058823529
931345,4,6304841027,"Very interesting, fun and a new way to view lots of movies/shows.  My only complaint is that the same ""clips"" are used over and over in some parts...as if there weren't enough movies/shows to edit?  Over all, I'd recommend for anyone who is a sci-fi addict.",1168300800,10,257,4.565217391304348
931346,3,6304841027,"""A Century of Science Fiction"" is a nicely packaged set with five single-sided DVDs and a fold-out episode guide insert. The DVDs contain 26 individual episodes, each dealing with a separate topic of the history of science fiction cinema. Most of the episodes are theme-based, such as ""Alien Life Forms,"" ""Amazing Inventions,"" ""Lost Worlds,"" ""Powers of the Mind"" and ""The End of the World."" Others have a narrower, more specific focus, such as the episodes on ""H.G. Wells,"" ""Jules Verne"" and ""Ray Harryhausen.""

The blurb on the back of the DVD case touts that this is ""the very best of science fiction and fantasy from a century of cinematic magic, told in 26 haunting half-hour shows."" Well, yes and no. There's a little hyperbole in this breathless prose.

First, the shows are not a half hour long--each one is between 22 and 23 minutes, up to the closing credits. No big deal, that's still between 572 and 598 minutes, or nearly 10 hours, of ""cinematic magic."" It is, however, neither ""over 666 minutes"" as plastered on the front of the case, nor ""approx. 676 minutes"" as shown on the back. Even stranger, the label of each DVD says ""running time approx. 203 minutes,"" which is 1,015 minutes total. This is so far off that it's ridiculous. How hard can it be for a DVD producer to figure out how long the feature is and print it consistently on the product?

Anyway, running time inaccuracies aside, the main thing you need to know if you're interested in this set is this: it consists largely of trailers. If you're looking for a thoughtful, insightful analysis of science fiction films that puts them into a historical context, or even relates them to each other within the genre, you won't find it here. The narrator does not do much more than verbalize the name of the film and maybe summarize a few plot points in conjunction with what the trailer shows. In fairness, there are some scenes that don't come from trailers, but not very many.

The other thing you need to know is that this is not exactly a ""new"" release. While the packaging shows a copyright date of 2006, the copyright date in the credits for each episode is 1998, so this is actually a re-packaged release of material that was first available eight years ago.

The image quality, of course, varies tremendously, but that's forgivable--it's a function of the age and storage conditions of the source material. Many old Technicolor films, for instance, without expensive professional restoration, are very red. Less forgivable is the fact that A LOT of the footage repeats from show-to-show. With 100 years of science fiction cinema to choose from, I would think the producers could find 572 minutes (or 666 minutes, or 676 or 1,015...) without having to repeat.

So, on balance, I rate ""A Century of Science Fiction"" with three stars. It was fun to see scenes (even trailers) from films that haven't seen the light of day in years, and there are plenty of them. The set has reasonably good production values, and it's pretty cheap. But, in my opinion, it could have been so much better.",1161302400,39,3062,4.735459662288931
931347,4,6304841027,"This DVD contains mostly Trailers and some behind-the-scenes shots and small interviews (like the one with Yul Brynner about ""Westworld"") from SF movies of the last century, narrated by the great Christopher Lee (with his pleasant voice). There are also some rather rare clips (like the ones from ""Fire Maidens from Outer Space"" or ""The Mysterians"").
The 99 minutes are divided in 8 parts of about 12 minutes each with the following categories: Aliens, Time Travellers, Mad Doctors, Robots & Computers, Sci-Fi Lunacy, Lost Worlds, Future Worlds and Weird Worlds.
And yes, it sometimes looks like it was made with the good ol' Commodore 64, but that's rather charming in a certain way ;-)

931348,1,6304841027,"This video looks like it was put together in someone's basement with a Commodore 64. The production values are of the poorest quality, but they look good compared to the awful script they force Christopher Lee to mouth.
The film clips look like they were copied from TV trailers and Lee has a blue chromakey halo around him. The only way I can figure they got him to appear in this bottom-of-the-barrel production is that his taxes were due and he was strapped for cash.
The content ignores the history of both print and film science fiction, instead larding on purple prose to cover poor research.

931536,1,6304841027,"I was hoping that this show would explain the evolution of science fiction in TV, movies, and books but instead this series only shows stock footage of old si-fi movies and giving a plot summary for each one.  Both of the narrators are boring, monotone, and do not teach or explain anything.  This series holds not educational value and it is not remotely entertaining.

931540,3,6304841027,"This is a series of partial trailers and sound bites. It of course being 1998 is a tad dated but that can be over looked.

Several times the narrator misses the point or misinterprets the films being displayed. Once in a while he is quite funny. However for the most part he makes statements like the story 1984 was made into two films; he does not state which two films: 1984 (John Hurt), 1984 (Edmond O'Brien), 1984 (Peter Cushing), etc.

In the book The Time Machine by H.G. Wells the two races were created by economic or class differences. In the movie it was where one chose to live (above or below ground). The narrator of this presentation said it was a class or economic problem.

We get similar misinterpretations on The Planet of the Apes film clips.

The actual section on H.G. wells did a good job of describing H.G. and his approach to writing his novels. They did a good contrast of different versions of The Island of Dr. Moreau.

Talk about repartition many of the clips are used over and over again; to their credit the narration is different over the same clip.",1385164800,,1080,4.489795918367347
931541,1,6304841027,"A review of ANY movie can be subjective -- one might not like westerns, or a certain actor, or whatever.

Documentaries -- ESPECIALLY documentaries about art, or books! -- are hard to do badly. Ted Newsom, the ""writer"" and ""director"" (I use those terms VERY loosely with this individual) has managed to make the WORST documentary I have ever had the misfortune of being suckered into purchasing. I googled it when buying films related to Ray Bradbury and his works. And though it supposedly covered ALL of science fiction, I figured that was okay, since I enjoy other writers, etc.  Imagine my horror -- not terror, as he would say but HORROR -- at watching Christopher Lee stumble while reading some of the most inane, ill-informed and sophomoric writing about ANY subject, as this ""documentary"" (once again, I use the term VERY loosely) droned on.  I was prepared to overlook the fact that the subject broached ISN'T, in fact, Science Fiction -- which would include discussions and interviews about novels and short stories -- because it quickly became evident that the ""documentary"" was bout science fiction (and fantasy, and horror) FILMS.  But as I continued to watch (the horror! the horror!), I found that the inane ""script"" (I use the term loosely) Christopher Lee stumbles through was accompanied by 1) LOTS of really badly edited, badly filmed (seemingly by putting in a movie on someone's TV and filming it) footage of old movies, TV shows and the like 2) one, maybe two, quick interviews -- also derived from other sources -- with one or two SF authors -- although two minutes, or so, of Ray Bradbury is all I remember 3) a few interviews with actors and movie types (Denzel Washington, etc.) who KNOW LITTLE OR NOTHING about science fiction (one of the interviews, with Kevin Cosner, consisted of his defending the cost of producing ""Waterworld"").

In summation: WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE on Amazon (and that includes a badly done documentary of Charles Beaumont)!

AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS!",1342310400,5,2011,4.882697947214076

Yes, it's nice to see bits of films that I haven't watched in a long time, but, as others here have pointed out, a very limited number of clips are included across the breadth of the whole series.  How many times do we have to see the trailer for ""Predator""?!

This set is an almost complete waste in the respect that it's aimed neither at fans of SF nor those curious about BECOMING fans of SF.  The fan will find virtually nothing new here, and the proto-fan will find nothing interesting or intriguing.

Chris Lee fans beware: Lee hosts but two of the 26 episodes in this set.",1172620800,9,624,4.344827586206897

Also, the narrator, a Yuge Actor from the Past, was for me pedantic, overly self-important, and spoke slowly in his Big Movie Actor voice like a vocalizing sloth.

This piece turned out to be a lesson in How NOT To make a similar documentary.

Sure, its true that Christopher Lee only recorded the introduction and conclusion and those were used in all the chapters (!!). Also true; almost all the footage included are old trailers with poor video quality. But the heart of this production is the illustration of the different themes presented universally in science fiction films like: the end of the world, dinosaurs,artificial intelligence, etc. I enjoyed most of all the chance to revisit old movies and to discover unknown ( to me) b-movies Ill like to watch someday.",1524009600,,620,5.029126213592233
7877872,1,6304841027,"This is presumably a follow-up to the 1996 series ""100 Years of Horror,"" a low-budget collection of monster movie trailers and interview clips, hosted and narrated by Christopher Lee, who provided some fairly interesting first-person backstory trivia throughout each episode.

This series, ""A Century of Science Fiction,"" is unfortunately even lower budget, again featuring movie trailers and clips, but only generic intro and outro appearances by Christopher Lee in each episode.  The rest is just a running monologue by unknown narrators, with no ""inside story"" trivia whatsoever.  This whole series sounds like a clich-filled highschool essay on sci-fi cinema, frankly; and the amateurish computer-animated title sequence is embarrassingly bad, also.

Might be useful as a sleep aid, but not much else.",1518652800,,805,5.628099173553719

True to the Form,  the low budget review seems copied from VHS tape, but that adds charm for people who remember Old TV the way it was,
static,  black and white,  fuzzy color with  even worse sound  -  No 4K HD Stereo here - and that is a good thing.
The media changes in technology threaten to erase our history -  from nitrate film, silent film, to  black and white, to color film,  video tapes, DVDs, Blurays, and now 4K digital.  This reviews things as they were seen back then.
If you are wondering what old movies would be a good viewing - here are dozens of films for you to consider.  Some you may have seen already.
Oddly enough, in the first episode,  one film predicted robotics to be replacing humans  by 2071.  2017 as I write this and already drivers and fast food workers, ambulances, taxis, trucks, and construction machines being automated to work as robots.  No humans needed.
It is VERY interesting to see the SciFi predictions of the past, what they missed out on (social decay) and what they predicted (cell phones, etc)
A good view for when you want to see where film was, and realize some of the big time movies of today are just re-makes of films from the 1950s",1489017600,3,1255,4.395652173913043

7877877,2,6304841027,"I should have read some of the reviews before I indulged in taking some time to watch this. (Normally, I do read the reviews!). This was unfortunately a very cheap production assortment of various schlocko movie clips of the past. To be fair, there were some good clips out of 2001, Things To Come, Alien, etc., but they threw in some vintage Ed Wood and Roger Corman grade D films as well that need you to put a clothespin on your nose, or just to laugh to see how terrible and goofy it all was. Someone paid Christopher Lee to put on a Tux, and speak an opening to each episode, (The same opening for each episode), and a closing, (The same closing for each episode). that totals about 60 seconds. The narration is conducted by two separate men, and the quality of the narration is mediocre at best. You do get to see some clips of movies that you had forgotten all about, and then promptly wished to forget them again. The low quality production of this series makes you think that it was inspired by Ed Wood, and some of the clips help you remember how bad some bad movies can be. This....was pretty awful.
In all actuality, the premise of a Series like this could have been something really wonderful and entertaining, as well as educational. In the end, the poor writing, poor editing, and the cheap production values just make this series sink like a rock. I do not totally regret watching it, but am disappointed in that something like this could have been so much better.",1486512000,5,1480,4.464944649446495
