7991716,5,B00009MEJJ,"I can scarcely review this film/drama/play.  Anybody that's into the absolutely finest
acting, the theater, British films, serious drama, the Angry Young Man/Kitchen Sink drama
genres, needs to go avail of this immediately and see it,
if you haven't yet, or like me, was a young tyke when it first came out.
This is truly rough stuff.  You have been forewarned.  There's not an ""easy""
or wasted scene/second in this entire film/drama.  There's just enough comic relief
to barely shield one from the sheer pain here.  And I mean, barely.  Brian Cox is so good,
he barely even has to utter a few words here and there to get his character across to us.
He conveys the whole family's resentments, disappointments, and under the surface anger
and rage at past abuse and neglect, sometimes sheerly by the pained/confused look upon
his face, or his reticence at times to really come out and say what he feels or thinks.
This is what you call acting.

I swear, In Celebration almost makes Albee's poisonous Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf look lightweight. Painful,
devastating, yet utterly riveting. And it's barely dated given the delicate way the material
was handled and directed.  It could be 1972, 1965, or it could be 2014. Bleak House
my b--t, this is the real deal, right here. Don't get no more bleak than In Celebration.
A total top-shelf acting class in one film.  I recommend watching this in association
with the early Mike Leigh films (his TV dramas, etc.) and working your way forwards/backwards with all
concerned.  This DVD looks and sounds pretty sharp, too, whether or not it's been restored or not.",1414454400,4,1610,4.821818181818182

and dealing with the struggles of moving into another class and life.",1390780800,3,132,4.739130434782608
7991718,5,B00009MEJJ,"Very good actors in a very good play.
I simply love it. I saw it several times
now and  i still discover new things
and am amazed by the perfect timing.",1381708800,4,152,3.903225806451613
7991719,4,B00009MEJJ,"Interesting, well acted (by Alan Bates, Brian Cox among others) study of a dysfunctional working class English family where the three sons have become educated and moved up in the world, but are still held back emotionally by the wounds of childhood.  Feels very stagy, and some of the writing is too theatrical for film, but much of it is moving and nicely complex; interestingly combining the personal and the political.",1288051200,6,422,4.943661971830986
7991720,5,B00009MEJJ,"This is a beautiful play, gorgeously written by David Storey, marvelously directed by Lindsay Anderson, and beautifully well-acted by the incomparable Alan Bates and company. Brian Cox, in one of his first performances, plays one of the tortured sons of a working-class family that has never come to grips with the loss of the first son, nor ever admitted the mother's attempted suicide. Together now for the parents' 40th anniversary, the three surviving sons want both to confront the parents with the truth and to let the past go. Drunk and tired, they argue over the past, one trying to smooth things over while the other stirs things up. The play is masterfully conceived. It is tight, plotted according to Aristotle's strictest codes of  singularity and brevity. The entire company drawn from the famous Royal Court is superb, but it is especially gratifying to see the late Sir Alan Bates and the young Cox, who has matured into such a formidable character actor. Landau's filmed theatre series is one of the treasures of the 20th century.",1186099200,11,1046,4.943181818181818
