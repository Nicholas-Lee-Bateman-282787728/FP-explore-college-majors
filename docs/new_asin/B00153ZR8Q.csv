3140319,5,B00153ZR8Q,This series that MillCreekhas put out is a gem  from the past.  Created around the Time that the Adventures of Robin Hood starring Richard Greene it is full of action and will bring back lots of fond memories from those of us that are old of when we were kids.  I get a kick out of the theme Music .  I just wished that they had been able to get  all of the 39 episodes instead of just 30.,1252627200,4,389,3.8734177215189876

There are only 30 episodes on this 3 dvd set, I believe the original series contained 39. If you want to see a good programme from the past,this is my choice.

This DVD collection of three DVDs includes ten episodes each in no particular order.  And, that's the way it goes...  However, reproduction is more than adequate.  This is just a boy action television program.  Oh well, so much the better.  Perhaps, someday all thirty-nine episodes will be sold together with the marching song.

3140323,5,B00153ZR8Q,"This is easily the best of the British adventure series of the late fifties and early sixties, though possibly tied with Sir Francis Drake.  It has a great sense of the period, wonderful British character actors from that time and an energetic perfomance from Conrad Phillips, the first actor I ever associated with a role.  I had previously purchased the set offered on Amazon UK and was extremely dissappointed to discover that the theme song (The Freedom Song - ""Marching Behind William Tell, we rebel, in a cause that is just"") was not used.  Apparently, there were different theme songs used in the US and elswhere.  If you are counting on hearing that song on this version, be warned that it might just not be there.  Hopefully, someone will be able to post a review letting us know.  For more information regarding the different themes, see the reviews (including two of mine) on Amazon UK for William Tell.",1218672000,20,914,4.753164556962025

I hope that the great theme song is not left out because of legal considerations about the music, e.g., The Fugitive Season 2 part I.  The lead actor was great--as were the other cast members. I hope that all of the episodes will one day also be released.",1217203200,11,363,4.098591549295775

8257409,2,B00153ZR8Q,"This was a very good series even tho it lasted but one season. However, ignore the stupid 5-star reviews. This set should be avoided as it is neither complete nor are the episodes in sequential order. The series is offered complete on other UK sets and would be sufficient reason to get a region-free DVD player.",1370390400,,312,4.589285714285714
8257410,4,B00153ZR8Q,"My whole family liked this series.  We also like Daniel Boone, Robin Hood, and other oldies.  It becomes increasingly hard to find something to wartch with your kids that doesn't have language, nudity, or sex.  We recommend this one.",1301875200,,233,4.923076923076923
8257411,4,B00153ZR8Q,My sons really enjoyed watching these old DVDs. They are great for teaching moral and courage lessons.,1282003200,,102,5.0588235294117645
8257412,5,B00153ZR8Q,"They don't make shows like this anymore.  And it is to bad, because it is great.  I bought all three seasons of Robin Hood from the 50's so when I saw this I thought it might be good.  and I was right.  This is far better then the junk on TV now.",1273449600,3,246,3.673076923076923
8257413,3,B00153ZR8Q,"About 2/3 of these episodes have reasonable plot lines and acting. A Sunday afternoon or late night popcorn sort of show. About a third have plots or events almost as silly as the antics on Gilligans Island.

Overall pluses: Very moral, the good guys win and sometimes without violence. Even in B&W some of the outdoor shots are very scenic. Lots of entertainment for the price.

Downside: It was probably not a big budget show, as a result some credibility is lost. For example, all cottages in Switzerland seem to have exactly the same front porch. The episodes are not in broadcast or story line order on the disks. This often does not matter.  However the 1st episode  that explains Tell's background and initial run-in with the Austrians half way thru the DVD set. It seems more than half the episodes revolve around buying, making, or stealing arms to fight the occupying Austrians. There aren't many side stories of having interesting people of mysteries in the castle.

Major characters: Rebel William Tell is very driven and far more prone to be fight than say Robin Hood in the 50's TV series. He's also a family man with the aid of a wife who always had perfectly styled hair, even while living in a cave. Landburger Gessler is a pig, having no redeeming qualities at all. This one dimensional  character makes him rather predictable and uninteresting.",1272758400,4,1363,4.778723404255319
8257414,3,B00153ZR8Q,"I'll admit it - I love these old shows:  Richard Green's Robin Hood, The Adventurer of Sir Lancelot et al.  This despite the fact that this version of William Tell is, to be kind, a bit cheesy - the costomes are terrible, the settings equally bad, the acting is challanged and the theme song!  After hearing it twice I'm thankful for two things - a mute button and fast forward.  That said, it is pure entertainment and I will watch every episode.  Now if we could get the William Tell series titled 'Crossbow' that aired on the Family Channel, starring Will Lyman and Jeremy Clyde (of Chad and Jeremy fame) then we would really have some great viewing.",1272412800,3,653,4.5
8257415,4,B00153ZR8Q,"This series caught my eye when it was played as a late night filler. The plots are a bit far fetched, but it is interesting to see the use of an obscure medieval legend from Switzerland as a TV show. I liked it. Better than ""Merlin"".",1253491200,4,233,4.086956521739131
