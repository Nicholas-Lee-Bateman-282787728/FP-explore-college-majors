399265,2,6301977211,"Burt Lancaster was a great actor who made many subpar movies.  'THE SCALPHUNTERS' certainly falls into this category. Lancaster plays 'Joe Bass' a trapper who spends the entire film trying to regain the furs that have been stolen from him -- first, by Indians (very original) and second, by a group of bandits known as scalphunters.  The way they are portrayed seems to make them be better suited to an episode of 'Wagon Train' than as villainous renegades.
  Early on Lancaster ecounters Joseph Lee, a cultured runaway slave played by Ossie Davis - who is easily the best thing about this very nondescript film.  The two regularly engage in fistacuffs, generic discussions on race, and dialogue which is not as witty as the screenwriter thinks.  It's too bad. Lancaster and Davis are fine actors and their interplay had potential. Unfortunately the material lacked potential.
  Still, fans of westerns might enjoy this film. Telly Savalas makes a worthy villain and the action scenes are quite well done.  However, most would do well to check out a true overlooked classic western starring Lancaster -- 'THE PROFESSIONALS.'  A rare gem amid much of the rubbish that typified Lancaster's western flicks! Alas, these other reviewers are either western junkies or nostalgic revisionists.",1056499200,5,1285,5.134615384615385
399266,5,6301977211,"How has a good movie like The Scalphunters become largely unknown over the years while everyone knows what The Matrix is? With a fine cast lead by the legendary Burt Lancaster, Ossie Davis, Telly Savalis and Shelly Winters and with a lot of memorable dialogue and scenes, this is a great comedy western.
Joe Bass (Lancaster) is a fur trapper who has spent the whole winter collecting furs. When a pack of Indians lead by Two Crows take Joe's furs and leave him with Joseph Lee (Davis), an educated slave, Bass pursues the Indians to get his furs back. The two have a series of misadventures that also involves a party of Scalphunters lead by Jim Howie (Savalis), who take the furs from the Indians and also take Joseph Lee. Bass now has to get both his furs and his slave back.
The film works on many levels beside comedy. Some also might consider it a commentary on racial politics. The end of the movie, when Lancaster and Davis become covered in mud and are indistinguishable has some symbolism; the white and black man, while of a different color, are the same people.",1007337600,8,1072,4.5595854922279795
399267,5,6301977211,"Why do I give a movie 5 stars? Its when the film succeeds in doing exactly what it wants. If its also entertaining throughout, then I'm entirely satisfied. I don't know what real critics want beyond Swedish directors and Marlon Brando, so I often find their critiques to be misfires. So it is with THE SCALPHUNTERS. As a boy, all I knew about it to make me want to see it was that it was a Burt Lancaster movie. So me and my dad went to see it and I loved every minute of it from the funny title credits to the mud-bath ending. Its wry social commentary in the dialog between Ossie Davis(who almost steals the movie) and Lancaster was a superb wink at Hollywood's stereotypical treatment of minorities in the past and the racial tension and violence of the Sixties. The casting is terrific, with actors like Telly Savalas who can hold a comedic edge to their sadistic behavior. Given that Shelly Winters was a major old-flame of Lancaster's, it makes you wonder about the off-screen story of this movie. This is a beautifully paced, witty, gritty, well-acted, original movie.",978739200,,1075,4.604166666666667
399268,5,6301977211,"""The Scalphunters"" is a comic and entertaining western.  Joe Bass (Burt Lancaster) is a nomadic trapper on his way to the big city with  a season's worth of furs when he is waylayed by a band of Kiowa Indians who  force him to trade his furs for a well-educated black slave, Joseph  Winfield Lee (Ossie Davis).  The battle of wits and wills between the  frontier-wise Joe Bass and the erudite Joseph Lee evolves over the course  of the movie as the trapper relentlessly pursues the return of his furs.  His quest is complicated when a band of renegade scalphunters led by Jim  Howie (Telly Savalas) and his mistress Kate (Shelly Winters) end up with  both the furs and Joseph Lee. The action and humor are non-stop in this  well-paced, well-cast film.  There is even an interesting touch of social  satire when Joe Bass and Joseph Lee become indistinguishable during a fight  in mud bog.
The direction by Sydney Pollack; the cinematography,  featuring both mountain and desert locales; and the musical score composed  by Elmer Bernstein are outstanding.  Mr. Bernstein is renowned for his  legendary score in the ""The Magnificent Seven."" Here, he once  again captures the vibrant drive and energy of the sprawling American west.  With due respect to Leonard Maltin, I think you will find this to be an  enjoyable, if under-rated motion picture.",953164800,8,1344,4.884444444444444

I enjoyed this movie because it was fun and very entertaining with a cast that includes Shelley Winters,Ossie Davis, and Telly Savalas. Although this is not a typical western, it has a good plot with a lot of action and comic scenes.  I recommend this movie for an enjoyable evening of light entertainment - especially for Burt Lancaster fans.

Enjoy!

I think he may be one of the best actors of all time. Both he and Savalas are not very good people in this movie. Its hard to survive in the old west, so I guess you have to be kind of a jerk. Even though Lancaster is supposed to be the protagonist and Savalas the antagonist, neither of them is very nice. They are both pretty much scalpers. Savalas and his gang steal Lancasters booty and Lancaster tries to get it back from him. Shelly Winters, who plays Savalas girl, is also in it as her flamboyant typical self.  I would only recommend this if you are a fan of the actors and of westerns in general. I don't think it was a very big budget movie and probably kind of a quickie throw-away movie. You can probably find it free on demand or online so if you hate it, at least all you wasted was time.",1406505600,2,979,3.895

399723,5,6301977211,"This 1968 western directed by Sydney Pollack is a most excellent thing and I liked it a lot. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Somewhere in the Wild West not very long before the War Between States a trapper named Joe Bass (Burt Lancaster) travels with a full cargo of hides, furs and pelts, when he is ambushed by a group of heavily armed hostile Indians from Kiowa tribe. Because Joe Bass always lived well with the Kiowa, their leader Two Crows (Armando Silvestre) decides that he will not be killed, but still robs him of his furs. They even give him a  ""payment"" - a Black slave, a certain Joseph Lee (Ossie Davis), who used to live previously with the Comanches, but was then captured by the Kiowa during a raid.

Joe Bass however is not somebody to let himself be robbed so easily, so, after informing Joseph Lee that he intends to sell him later on a slave market to recover some of his losses, he goes after the Kiowa warriors to try to recover his furs, forcing the very reluctant Joseph Lee to follow him. That is the beginning of a voyage through wilderness, during which the half-illiterate but full of common sense Bass and surprisingly well read and educated but sometimes just a little bit naive Lee will live lots of very interesting and also very dangerous adventures - and also discuss, bicker and fight like you have no idea...)))

At one moment their way will also cross that of an extremely dangerous and terminally unpleasant desperado named Jim Howie (Telly Savalas), who is the leader of a band made of a lot of abject characters, real devil rejects spit out by hell with disgust and of a group of prostitutes, led by an absolutely horrible madam named Kate (Shelley Winters).

This is a very unusual western, carried mostly by the incredible conversations and permanent conflict between Bass and Lee, but also by the incredible and absolutely ABJECT duo made by Howie and Kate - honestly, this must be one of best roles for Telly Savalas EVER and Shelley Winters is also absolutely perfect here.

This is not exactly a ""classical"" western, as there are elements of burlesque comedy, social drama and deliberate parody, all mixed with elements of brutality and gritty realism imported from spaghetti westerns - and yet all this mixture somehow plays very, very well indeed.

I will keep that review short as I don't want to reveal anything more about this film, so I will just say that you REALLY WANT to see this film, one of the best of Sydney Pollack. This later famous director was in this time still in the beginning of his career and ""Scalphunters"" was just his third film but he was clearly already at the top of his game - barely one year later he was going to direct ""They shoot horses, don't they?""...

Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film which I enjoyed mightily and I will absolutely keep this DVD for future viewing. ENJOY!",1403049600,,2890,4.619883040935672

In many of his films, Burt Lancaster's mannerisms i.e. ""the grin""  sort of diminished his acting efforts. I actually forgot I was  watching Burt Lancaster which is a sign of a good acting job. Ossie Davis is excellent, maybe better than Lancaster, as the slave who seeks his freedom. Nevertheless, both Lancaster and Davis turn in superlative acting efforts. Of course, Telly Savalas plays his usual excellent, slimy heavy. The movie touches on several ""unfunny"" subjects, scalphunting and slavery, and manages to do a good job commenting on both along with a typical story line, Lancaster trying to get his hides back. The hides are sort of a McGuffin as the movie is more interested in the interplay between Lancaster and Davis concerning Davis's character's slave status.

399858,4,6301977211,"I've always been quite delighted with Burt Lancaster's acting, but the films he has appeared in range in quality from the best (""The Train,"" ""Elmer Gantry"") to the mediocre (""The Kentuckian""). This film gives him the opportunity to demonstrate his best. His voice is the Elmer Gantry voice, but shaded with irony; his style is perfect; the combination of his self-deprecating frontier wit and his obvious arrogance makes him an easy protagonist to like -- an arrogant man who makes fun of himself seems far less arrogant.
Ossie Davis's character is only a bit less easy to empathize with -- he's an accomplished conniver who is more than ready to tell anyone what they want to hear (for a price). However, his status as an escaping slave allows the audience to immediately forgive his ingratiating personality.
Shelley Winters as Jim Howie's woman is delightful -- she is whiney, self-centered, vain, morally bankrupt -- and still gains sympathy as the woman whose lot it is to put up with Howie.
Telly Savalas as the villain, Howie, is at his best -- he is nasty, vicious, and unintentionally comical. The comic elements provide just the right mix to make him watchable, rather than an empty caricature.
The real theme is that the Davis character, Joseph Lee, must demonstrate he is a man and the Lancaster character, Joe Bass, must recognize Lee as a man. In the hopeful spirit of 1968, both men realize their ends. This is a film in which the protagonists genuinely grow.
The film's only weakness lies in the ending -- the slapstick fight between Bass and Lee goes on too long and the characters are far too oblivious to the dangers behind them -- more oblivious than either of the savvy pair would be. Since that one bad scene is in the ending, it detracts seriously from the film. Otherwise, great stuff!",1308614400,4,1809,4.764331210191083

I saw this when I was a kid.  I remembered it as great as McClintock.  Kids don't have good memories.  It's nowhere near as good as that movie.  But it is still a very good western.

Joe Bass (Burt Lancaster) is a trapper.  His furs are stolen from him by the Indians.  They give him a slave to make up for it.  Except he doesn't want the slave, he wants his furs.  He follows the Indians, only to see them massacred and his furs stolen by someone new.

He stays on the new people's trail.  He's still stuck with his new slave, who is a great deal more educated than Joe himself.  The constant friction between Joe and his slave is a riot.  Joe's stubborness about letting go of his furs is just as much fun.

399925,3,6301977211,"""The Scalphunters"" opens with an illiterate frontier fur trapper named Joe Bass (Burt Lancaster) refusing to trade his furs, with the Kiowa Indians, for a runaway field slave... But at the end, he is forced at gunpoint to do that and Bass finds himself, in one moment, the owner of Joseph Lee (Ossie Davis), an escapee from Louisiana, formerly of the Comanche tribe, until stolen by the Kiowas...

Lee, an African--slave by employment, black by color--results one of the highest educated families in Louisiana, who can read and write... Lee's intention was to circle south, as far as Mexico, because the Mexicans have a law against the slavery trade...

Bass' immediate plan was to catch up with the Kiowas and get back his pack horse and furs... But his plan soon failed when a band of scalphunters led by a dangerous double-crosser, Jim Howie (Telly Savalas) attack the poor Indians killing almost all of them and taking, by the way, Bass' property... Bass-- a man who moves mountains to get what he wants-- stampedes their wagons and makes the scalphunters' horses dangerous to ride...

The sweetest, and in some ways the funniest moments come out when Bass talks to his horse... In one scene, he gets so excited, and turns back to his stallion saying: ""By god, you have got an idea!""

Telly Savalas makes Kojak a charmer, but in Pollack's film he is a psychopathic bounty hunter who slaughters a dozen Indians...

Kate (Shelley Winters)--a cigar-puffing doxy qualified to do things to any man--is sick about her lover's wagon... She complains that she lives like a squaw... Kate's dream was to live like a lady in a fancy house with servants... Winters delivers the best line of the whole movie when she exclaimed at the end of the film: ""What the hell? They're all men.""

Ossie Davis comes out with a real sense of humor... In one scene he explains to Kate the benefits of the common cactus, known to the Comanches as Maguey... He makes her believe that this plant was used in the ancient times by the Queen of Sheba to restore the natural oils to her beautiful blond hair...

It was nice to see Nick Cravat in a modest role as one of Savalas' men... As you remember, Cravat was ideally cast as Lancaster's sidekick, Piccolo, in the flamboyant ""The Flame and the Arrow"" in 1950, a spoof of the Robin Hood genre, set against the castle battlements and banquets halls of medieval Lombardy...",1234224000,,2394,4.712918660287081

399927,4,6301977211,"Sydney Pollack's ""The Scalphunters"" (1968) is a briskly-paced, revisionist Western with an entertaining script and equally entertaining performances by a strong cast. Given the title, some viewers may expect a serious and gritty drama about the depraved scalp hunters who plagued the American West. However, in actuality, this well-written light-hearted film is a clever blend of both comedic and dramatic elements.

The story is complicated, yet easy to follow: Joe Bass (Burt Lancaster) is a grizzled, Bible-reciting fur trapper with a monomaniacal attachment to his beaver pelts. Held up by Indians, Bass is forced to exchange his pelts for the tethered Joseph Lee (Ossie Davis), an escaped slave who formerly served an educated family in Louisiana. Bass and a reluctant Lee pursue the Indians but, through a twist of fate, Bass' furs fall into the hands of scalp hunters led by Jim Howie (the always engaging Telly Savalas), a burly ruffian henpecked by his prostitute-girlfriend Kate (a fussy, cigar-chewing Shelley Winters).

It is the latter performances which is the key to the film's success. Lancaster, Davis, Savalas and Winters effortlessly spin out humorous performances. And the best scenes are the humorous ones, such as when Savalas yells at Winters' to stop singing those damn Mormon songs or when Savalas defiantly tells Lancaster that he will kill him then steps on a cactus while returning to the wagon.

Yet for all its amusing tomfoolery, the film has a message: The axis of that message revolves around the dyadic relationship between trapper Joe Bass and the slave Joseph Lee; their hopes and their prejudices. Bass desires only to reacquire his pelts and Lee desires only to escape to Mexico. Both are reluctant to help the other. Each holds the other in contempt: Bass views Lee as a meek slave, and Lee views Bass as an uneducated hick. But, in the final scene, both characters are covered in mud; the color of their skin obscured. It is in this scene they find their equality, and one grasps the subtly of the film's psychology.",1221091200,,2056,5.041176470588235

399929,5,6301977211,"This unique entertaining film is, in part, a traditional Western, with several skirmishes involving ""Indians"", a gang of scalp-hungry outlaws, and a loner trapper, who comes to grief from both. In part, it's a slapstickish reluctant buddy comedy, involving Bert Lancaster, as trapper Joe Bass, and escaped slave Joseph Lee(Ossie Davis), as well as  the often caustic patter between floozy Kate(Shelly Winters) and Jim Howie(Telly Savalas), boss of the fleeing outlaw gang. The trade of Joseph Lee forced on Bass by the Kiowas in exchange for his year's catch of furs and pack horse serves as a parody on the exchange of desirable lands or other property for poor or diminished lands or goods often forced on various Native American tribes.
  Joseph Lee hopes to get across the Mexican border, where slavery is outlawed and blacks welcomed. He's willing to do whatever it takes to get to Mexico. Joe Bass's immediate goal is to retrieve his furs and horse. At first, Lee plays along with helping Bass retrieve his furs. But when he is captured by an outlaw gang, who stole Bass's furs from the Kiowas and who happen to be headed for Mexico, his loyalty between Bass and the outlaws is split.  Both talk down to him, as if he were intrinsically inferior, and talk about selling him on the slave market. Part of the comedy relates to the fact that Lee clearly has absorbed far more high class white culture from his former owners than Bass or the outlaws will ever absorb. Remember, this film was released in 1968, the year Martin Luther King was assassinated.
  Bass nearly recaptures his furs several times, with or without the help of Lee. In addition to an uncanny ability to track down his adversaries and to escape their far greater numbers, he surrealistically pushes quite a few 1000 lb boulders down on them in quick succession, then later poisons a water hole with locoweed juice, to make their horses revert into untamed bucking broncos(an idea he generously gives his horse credit for).
  In the final showdown between Bass and Howie, Lee has to decide whom to help, with the consideration in his mind of how he might best get to Mexico. Lee and Bass then have a long, sometimes slapstickish, fight in a muddy watering hole, ending in a draw, both covered with the grayish mud, thus enhancing the impression of equality. But,in a sense, they are both losers, as the Kiowas return . Taking advantage of the distraction of Lee and Bass and the much weakened outlaw gang, Two Crows reclaims the contested furs and pack horse, as well as the now unclaimed Shelly Winters and what's left of the gang's supplies.
  Some think the film should have ended with Lee escaping both Bass and Howie, with Bass's furs and horses to boot, as he almost did.  I can certainly see merit to that view.  However, the furs and pack horse rightfully belonged to either the Kiowas or Bass(depending on your view point) Besides, we needed to give Lee a chance to show he could duke it out with Bass physically, as well as intellectually, demonstrating that he is at least as respectable as Bass and the other white men, if not more so. Also, we needed to give the Kiowas a chance to revenge their loss. Yes, the parting scene leaves us wondering what became of Bass and Lee, supposedly the two main characters, and thus is less than satisfying.
  I should point out than many slaves did make it to freedom in Mexico, often with the aid of Mexicans in Texas. I should also point out that the Kiowas and Comanches were long-term military allies in the 1800s, thus  Lee's claim that Kiowas raided his host Comanches is unlikely, historically.",1214697600,,3623,4.7104430379746836

399931,5,6301977211,"This terribly misunderstood movie suffers from its refusal to fully subscribe to the cliches of a single genre. It is a western: horses, guns, parched landscape and all. It is also a bit of a savage social sendup. The scalphunters of the title were white men (and their women) who killed Native  Americans for money. The bounty for the murder was paid on their scalps.
There's also a wonderful theme about the wary ex-slave-one of many in the west who've been left out of the western movie genre.
This was very subversive stuff back when the film was shot and the slight nod-and-wink that the director and cast make to the viewers were post-modern back in a pre-post-modern time.
Along with its many layers, this is a crackin' good story. Telly Savalas does his best work ever as the leader of the scalphunters and Shelly Winters plays the role she was born to. Ossie Davis plays the rle that made his career with canny delicacy and Burt Lancaster brings a physical grace to the character of the fur trader who is robbed first by Native Americans and then by the scalphunters.

The Scalphunters does the same thing within a Western setting .The runaway slave Joseph Winfield Lee (Ossie Davis) captured by Kiowas and traded to fur trapper Joe Bass (Burt Lancaster)is way more educated ,literate and smart than his new ""master"".They are compelled to work together when a gang headed by Telly Savalas steals the furs .Once this task is accomplished futher trouble breaksout between them culminating in a rousing -if over prolonged fist fight leaving them both covered in mud which turns them both a symbolic shade of grey

This is a movie reflecting the political tensions of its era and it wears its liberal credentials proudly .The symblism in the script is a trifle heavy handed and Sideney Pollack is not an iodeal director for this kind of outdoor action drama. However this is good fun  and does have lashings of charm ,For my money it stops short of greatness by virue of its direction and a certain ambiguity in the movie .It s poised  between being a traditional western and a more modern one ,between drama and slapstick comedy .However it has charm and incident ,a raft of excellent performances -especially a brisk turn from Savalas and a deft one from Shelly Winters as his floosie -making a return to the kind of good hearted tart role she played early in her career,Her response to being tradfed to the Kiowas is a model of benign insouciance and provides the best moment in the movie.

Former IRA gunrunner turned screenwriter William Norton's almost Dickensian dialogue in the first third of the movie is so good that it's a shame that the plot separates Burt Lancaster and Ossie Davies for so long and while it makes some smart points about racism along the way there's a feeling of the film almost running down rather than building up to a climax.

Joe Bass starts off to sell his years worth of furs when the Kiowas show up and forcefully exchange the furs for a run-away slave named Joseph Lee(Ossie Davis)...Joseph had taken up residency, after running away from the plantation, with the Comanches until the Kiowas raided and slaughtered the Comanches capturing him in the process.  Joe Bass of course doesn't want him and so they set off to retake the furs.  In a display of misadventures, the furs are in turn taken from the Kiowas by the Scalphunters led by Jim Howie(Telly Savalas).

The continued misadventure of chasing after the furs, combined with a great budding relationship between Joe Bass and Joseph Lee, make this movie very enjoyable.  Lee is far more educated than Bass and he is doing his best, with whatever and whomever is available, to escape off to Mexico and finally be free from Joe Bass, the Kiowas and Jim Howie.

Rounding off this movie's cast is Shelley Winters..in one of her more enjoyable roles..as Jim Howie's girlfriend Kate.  The Sunday scene of her and her girls singing Eliza R.

 THE SCALPHUNTERS (1968) is a comedy-western that somehow manages to makes palatable some terrible things - specifically, slavery and the harvest and sale of human scalps.  It doesn't condone them, of course, but it doesn't dwell on their horrors, either.  Lancaster is energetic and perfectly cast as the savvy fur trapper who is determined to get what's his back again.  Salavas and Shelley Winters as his trail moll, are pretty good, as well.  The heart of the thing, though, is Ossie Davis as the erudite slave who seems the only person to see the big picture, as it were.

399979,4,6301977211,"The Scalphunters is a very enjoyable western that is not as well known as some of star Burt Lancaster's other movies, but it is more than worthwhile.  Trapper Joe Bass is heading back to St. Louis with a pack mule full of beaver pelts when a group of Kiowas intervene and take his pelts, leaving him a smooth-talking, educated slave by the name of Joseph Windfield Lee.  Bass unwillingly takes Lee along, but before he can get his pelts back from the Kiowas, the warriors are attacked bya group of outlaws who scalp Indians for $25 a person.  Bass embarks on a journey to get his beaver pelts back, no matter what it takes.  The Scalphunters is not considered a classic western, but it has everything to make it highly enjoyable.  A great cast, a lively musical score from Elmer Bernstein, beautiful scenery, and the right mix of action and humor all combine to make one of Lancaster's better movies.

  The four main leads to the movie set The Scalphunters apart from many other westerns.  Burt Lancaster is great as Joe Bass, the trapper who will attempts to get his pelts back at all costs.  Bass is similar to Lancaster's Bill Dolworth in The Professionals in that he enjoys living and will stop at nothing to keep on enjoying living.  Telly Savalas is also very good as the villain, Jim Howie, the leader of the gang of scalphunters who steals Bass' pelts.  Shelley Winters seems somewhat out of place as Kate, Howie's woman who wants to get out of the west and into a big city as fast as she can.  Ossie Davis steals the movie as Joseph Windfield Lee, the highly educated runaway slave who becomes Joe Bass' unwilling companion.  The interplay between Lancaster and Davis provide some of the movie's most hilarious moments.  The DVD offers a beautiful-looking widescreen presentation and a theatrical trailer.  For a lesser known but still very good western with great perfomances from Lancaster, Savalas, and Davis, check out Sydney Pollack's The Scalphunters!",1123459200,12,1967,4.758112094395281
399980,5,6301977211,"""The Scalphunters"" is entertaining and quite funny. Although the film is often interpreted as a social satire on slavery and its historical effects on race relations, for reasons described below, it is best viewed as a case of chance or circumstance and not as social satire.

The master's freedom is only apparent because it owes its recognition to the slave, who is not ""equal"" and therefore not in a position to fully recognize the master as such. The slave's bondage is in fact an education to a ""freedom"" higher than that of the master. Each man is deceived by his condition. Neither is free but it is the slave who gives birth to the idea of freedom, which then has all the force of a religion or ideology. The master's assertion of difference qua recognition makes the master the slave of his slave. Thus the dialectic of the master/slave relationship never ends as long as one remains on the politicized level of anthropological freedom or equality as recognition of one's self. The slave can never be ""free"" as long as his concept of freedom remains within the orbit of the leveling concept of equality; by doing so he becomes self-conscious or cognizant of the fact that his freedom necessarily entails the negation of the other over whom he becomes master in order to establish his ""freedom"" (in contemporary terms this plays out in the ubiquitous desire to be ""creative"" or ""unique,"" i.e. the negation of equality or sameness). But when the slave becomes a master he immediately then becomes a slave, as described above. Pursuit of freedom and equality results in slavery. Satisfaction of the desire for freedom cannot be attained in this vicious circle, if at all. As the conditions of equality are actualized dissatisfaction increases (because of the innate desire of humans to differentiate), which always results in the demand for more freedom and more equality, usually under the guise of more ""rights.""

Given this one could view the film as a satire on satire, which would make it truly ironic in the Socratic sense. As Tocqueville explained, recognition would then recognize that ""freedom"" and ""equality"" are incompatible or mutually negating--freedom being the result of transcendence and equality a levelling force (see also Kierkegaard's essay ""The Results of Observing the Two Ages""). Modern self-consciousness of freedom and equality negate themselves resulting in an aufhebung of ancient self-knowledge. The self overcomes narcissism by recognizing that ""self-consciousness"" lacks significance in the cosmos in which I am as a ""self"" insignificant, i.e., by identifying itself as a part within the cosmic whole (Hegel's identity of identity and non-identity). This is all well understood in Eastern philosophy and religion (such as the Advaita Vedanta form of Hinduism and the Madhyamika form of Mahayana Buddhism), wherein the concept of the subject/object duality necessary for the Western notion of human freedom and equality is rejected in favor of the harmony of opposites, which are nonetheless hierarchically ordered in the human sphere by the cosmic force of dharma. The Chandogya Upanishad teaches that the self or atman is the same thing as the Absolute of Being, Brahman: tat tvam asi (thou art that). This means ""freedom"" can be realized only by overcoming the opposition of master/slave and thereby transcending one's desire for recognition of equality and fear of non-recognition or inequality.",1120780800,2,3434,5.174460431654676
399981,4,6301977211,"In 1968, it was appropriate that a western dealt with race relations, and The Scalphunters does so with action and humor.

Burt Lancaster plays Joe Bass, a trapper who is headed towards civilization with months worth of pelts and furs. He runs smack into a tribe of Kiowas who don't appreciate Bass trespassing on their land. They take the pelts, but exchange them for a runaway slave, Joseph Lee, played by Ossie Davis, who the Kiowas had taken from the Comanches. Lancaster doesn't want Joseph, and Joseph wants to get somewhere where he can be free, but they team up to relieve the Kiowas of Bass' pelts.

Before they can spring their plan to steal back the pelts, the Kiowas are attacked and slaughtered by scalphunters, roughneck types who get paid for each Indian scalp they turn in. The scalphunters take the pelts, and that's when the real fun begins. The Scalphunters are led by Telly Savalas, who brings along his constantly complaining girlfriend, played by Shelley Winters.

The Scalphunters has humor, action, and wry commentary on the relationships and perceptions of whites, blacks, and Indians. It's good that this rarely seen film is now on DVD.",1118016000,20,1162,4.888324873096447
399982,5,6301977211,"If you like clasic action films, you need to see this. Any action film with Burt Lancaster is worth your time. The fight scene between Lancaster and Savalas is outstanding old school western stuff. This is the type of film they don't make anymore and I'm glad to see it is now on dvd. My old vhs copy still serves me well, but I'm always looking for these type of classic 60's/70's films to make it to dvd format. This is action in the vein of Outlaw Josey Wales, Mackennas Gold, The Professionals ......excellent film.",1117670400,8,519,4.473684210526316
399983,2,6301977211,"While not as identified with the western movies as John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, Burt Lancaster made many forays into the western genre - unfortunately, many of these films were subpar movies. 'THE SCALPHUNTERS' certainly falls into this category. Lancaster plays 'Joe Bass' a trapper who spends the entire film trying to regain the furs that have been stolen from him -- first, by Indians (very original) and second, by a group of bandits known as scalphunters. The way they are portrayed makes them better suited for an episode of 'Wagon Train' or 'The Rifleman' than as villainous renegades.

Early on Lancaster ecounters Joseph Lee, a cultured runaway slave played by the late Ossie Davis - who is easily the best thing about this very mediocre film. The two regularly engage in fistacuffs, ""insightful"" discussions on race, and dialogue which is unfortunately not as witty as the screenwriter thinks. It's too bad. Lancaster and Davis are fine actors and their interplay had potential. The material, on the other hand, lacked potential.

The humor - and I use this term very loosely - is incredibly flat. [Producer's Memo: Hey, let's have Telly Savalas parade around in longjohns. Now that should guarantee a few laughs.] Add the usual dose of whining that a Shelley Winters (how the hell did she win 2 oscars in her career???)character contributes to the film and the last 40 minutes become particularly unwatchable.

Still, fans of westerns might enjoy this film. Burt Lancaster seems to be having plenty of fun. Telly Savalas makes a worthy villain (even if he does run around in his less than menacing longjohns for much of the film - GIGGLE, GIGGLE) and the action scenes are quite well done. But the social commentary is dated and preachy.  I know, Sydney Pollack being preachy? Imagine that. Most would do well to check out a true overlooked classic western starring Lancaster -- 'THE PROFESSIONALS.' A rare gem amid much of the rubbish that typified Lancaster's western flicks (sorry folks, but VALDEZ IS COMING, HALLELUJAH TRAIL, LAWMAN and APACHE are dreck!)",1117152000,6,2073,4.982658959537572
