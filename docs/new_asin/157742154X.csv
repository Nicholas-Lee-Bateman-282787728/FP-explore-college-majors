196203,5,157742154X,"Hey guys, omg you guys are all so sweet=) heh i`m Faith.. the Faith Bowyer [baby hooft] from the movie, i`m all grown up now [16] and i was just looking up stuff on my movie and i found this site! and you guys are so sweet for saying such nice things about my first movie!=).. i`ve never been in anything else, yet. I have audtioned though, unfortunately i just didn`t get the parts. It`s funny how i still get payed though, because they still play it on tv sometimes.
And yes, i still live in LiL `ol N.S. if you haven`t been here, you have got to visit!=)
It`s the greatest, yet weirdest feeling when i meet people that have seen the movie before, and didn`t know that i was in it, and the look on their face that i see when i tell them that i was the 'babby' as davy, and harry called me. I actually still have pictures that my mother got of me with Charleston Heston. Anyway i think that`s all i`m going to say, but thanks for the great comments people, and if you don`t already have this movie, than go out and buy it, or feel free to e-mail me too!=)

196204,5,157742154X,"This is a great family film.  There is no violence, sex, or bad language.  It is loosely based on a '50's movie of the same name.  It tells the story of two young Scottish orphan boys who travel by themselves from the ""Old country"" to join their father's family in Nova Scotia. There they encounter their stern disciplinarian grandfather who has shut off himself from some of his neighbors. There is particularly no love lost between the grandfather and his Dutch neighbors.  He blames the Dutch people for his son's death in the Boer War. A side plot is that this animosity is keeping apart the boy's aunt and her Dutch doctor suitor. The two boys change everything though when they find a young baby abandoned on the beach.",1081728000,3,725,4.596899224806202
196205,4,157742154X,"I am always looking for films that are decent.  This film fits in that catagory.  The boys steal away your heart.  Brave, strong, and with delightful personalities.  From beginning to end you will be intrigued with the boys ability to survive.  The other actors are top notch.  They keep the film interesting. I am going to add this to my collection of decent and entertaining films.",1070668800,2,383,4.7272727272727275
196206,4,157742154X,"The Little Kidnappers is an excellent family movie.  The subject, Canadian vs. Boer may seem a little unusual for Americans but once you settle into the movie, you become entranced by the performances of all the actors.
Patriarch Heston is a rigid unbending Nova Scotia Scot.  He is a hard worker but unschooled - he can write his name and laboriously read from the bible.  His work is his life.  He has estranged himself from his son who goes to serve in the Army in South Africa where he is killed.  The inability of Heston's charecter to see what he has created is what fuels the fire of resentment against his neighbors who happen to be of Dutch extraction.
The arrival of his orphaned grandsons just creates more problems for Heston.  The boys are unaware of the tension around them at first but the older of the two picks up quickly on his grandfather's resentment towards his neighbors. His actions at times are amusing but ultimately lead to a series of events that have the potential to seperate him from his remaining family members.
I think the boys know that this will be a difficult time for them when one asks their grandfather if the can get a dog. The reply is chilling, ""you can't eat a dog"".  They are entering a family with no frills or fancies.  Everything has a use of it is done without.  Therefore, if you can't eat a dog, it has no business being part of the family.  This would be a pretty dismal place for the boys but the show their abilitiy to adapt and make the best of the situation they have landed in.  Partly this is due to thier grandmother and aunt who do thier best to make the boys feel loved and wanted.
This movie works because it draws on solid charecter actors to supply the depth to the principles.  These charecters range from the town school teacher - a little bit sanctimonious one thinks, to the town mayor who doubles in brass as the general store owner.  These people make the film work as well as it does.  Be it a crowd scene at the piers at the start of the movie, or a wedding rececption dance, or a trial for kidnapping.  Without these people, it would be a pretty dull movie that even the vast talents of Charlton Heston wouldn't be able to save.
The Little Kidnappers is a good movie for families. It is a touching movie about families and growing up and even changing a little bit.  I recommend it highly to everyone.",1040688000,2,2373,4.408256880733945
196207,5,157742154X,"This is a warm and wonderful film... well-acted, especially by the young newcomers.  I was amazed to discover this was their debut!  The Nova Scotia background was beautiful.  Although very young viewers probably wouldn't understand the boys' accents or the hubbub they create, it is truly a family treat.  I copied it from the TV when it first came out and have shown it regularly to all and sundry ever since.  This movie was in part responsible for my vacation this year to Nova Scotia.",1030838400,,489,4.705882352941177

The ending melts your heart, and once again, Mr Heston is has overcome his hatred for the Boors who have killed his only son,  and sees the light.",1479168000,,411,4.311688311688312

The story depicts how the remnants of war, this time the Boor War, remain long after the war is over.  It's a story of childhood innocence that goes awry. Describes a life without the luxuries we enjoy today and yet a life that is satisfying.  Thankfully, it shows that adults can make meaningful changes in their attitudes toward others...changes that impact future generations.  It's a story that has a peaceful resolution to a legal problem. Best of all, the ending leaves the watcher with good feelings. It's a story I'll watch again & again.",1453334400,3,628,5.058252427184466

196307,5,157742154X,"This was a real find. It's too bad it isn't available on disc because it's terrific. Charlton Heston stars as a pious embittered Scot living in Nova Scotia who takes in his two young orphaned grandsons. Their father was killed in the Boer War and upon their arrival their sour grandfather teaches the older one about hating the Dutch (many have settled on the island). The plotting is layered and well executed including a subplot involving the boys repressed young aunt's involvement with a Dutch doctor, and the lads finding a small baby on the beach which creates havoc among the populace. Heston plays the tyrannical emotionally stymied patriarch well, and the two young boys are utterly beguiling and charming. Other than Heston, the cast is unknown.

This is yet another Amazon Instant Video that has never been reviewed. I have watched a great deal of junk through this service and this is an exception. I only wish I had this in my library. It is well done in all aspects. Don't expect a big budget as one would normally find in a Heston movie, but the look and feel are extremely well executed. The direction, acting, writing, cinematography are all top drawer.

Highly recommended.",1369353600,18,1191,4.804878048780488

196310,5,157742154X,"I have loved this movie ever since I saw it years ago on the Disney Channel.  It came out in 1990, so I thought my two young children (at that time ) would love it as well.  The film is set in 1903, in Nova Scotia, Canada, at a settlement inhabited by both Scottish and Dutch settlers.  James Mackenzie, the main character, is heavily prejudiced against his Dutch (Boer) neighbors, the Hooft family, due to the fact that his only son, Alec, was killed in the Boer War in South Africa.  Alec's wife also had died from some fever, and their two orphaned sons are travelling on their own to live with their ""granddaddy"".  The boys are the cutest tots you will ever encounter in any movie, dressed like little men in their kilts and name tags pinned to their shirts.  Harry, age 8, and Davy, aged 5 (or so) are at times sweet, mischievous, funny, endearing, rebellious, etc.  Little Davy wants so very much to have a dog, but his gruff grandfather, played by Charlton Heston, forbids it.  A frugal, bitter man full of hatred and unbreakable rules, he quickly alienates most of the settlers.  The movie is interesting, poignant, and heartwarming.  My only sadness is that my own children (including my now adult daughter), did not find this movie as moving as I did, but rather old-fashioned.",1365292800,5,1287,4.580786026200873

It truly is a tale with historical significance (Scottish and Dutch settlers in the late 1800/early 1900's in Nova Scotia, Canada and their prejudices due to the Boer War (South Africa) conflict. It moves along very well and entertains all age groups without being vulgar or unbelievable, which is uncommon. Charlton Heston is at his best.  However, the two little boys' acting makes one forget they are acting.  How they achieved such believable characters is quite an accomplishment. A good movie for any home or school's movie collection.",1357344000,,586,5.020618556701031

196317,2,157742154X,"My memory of the 1953 ""The Kidnappers"" was that it played in the Kent theatre in Montreal, Quebec, for a record 50+ weeks. It was illegal for children under 16 to go to a movie theatre in Montreal (because of a fire in a movei theatre which took the lives of 70 children) - only to Disney movies accompanied by a parent. So I remember seeing the marquee posting the long success of this movie. I finally got to see it on ""late"" TV one night.
It is possible to buy the VHS on-line as part of the British Classics Collection. If you see this first version, you will understand why 'special' Academy awards were given to the two boys who played Harry and Davy.",1288915200,,657,4.264

To my surprise we finally found a used copy (DVD)on Amazon offered by a used bookseller. I purchased it right away, it was in excellent condition. This movie is so charming, two young brothers who have lost their parents (the father in the Boer wars, and the mother by a fever)come to live with their Gruff Grandfather (played by Charelton Heston) who does a beautiful job in his character. The two young brothers, Harry and Davy will charm the socks off of you. In the beginning of the movie they are getting off a ship that brought them from Scotland to Canada to live with the grandparents. They are wearing their Scottish kilts. The grandfather has a prejudice against the Boers (Dutch) people in the community, which causes problems for him and Harry. There is a romance between Aunt Kirsty (the boys aunt)and the town doctor who happens to be a Boer. This does not sit well with the grandfather. The conversations between Harry and Davy will have you chuckling. Harry and Davy have a secret that they are keeping, which ends up finding Harry on trial.

196319,5,157742154X,"A Canadian-American production (CBC-Disney), set in Nova Scotia in 1903, this film features two utterly charming lads (Harry, 8 and Davy, 6), at ease before the camera, and who steal the show from Charlton Heston, the titular star.

The Boer War has been over a handful of years, Harry and Davy's father has been killed in the Boer War and their mother has died. They are sent by relatives in England to live with their Scots grandparents in Canada (Heston, Patricia Gage). Grandfather is deeply prejudiced against the Boer family who lives in the village, holding them responsible in the death of his son. A complicating factor is that Heston's daughter is in love with the Boer son. The effects of the prejudice on the immediate family and on the lads is the core of the story and leads to the incident suggested by the title.

This is a re-working of the original 1953 story. I haven't seen that one, so cannot compare the two. But this one is an all-around family film -- no swearing, sexual references, or violence -- but it's not flat and lifeless.

I rented it from Amazon Video On Demand for $1.99.",1266796800,,1106,4.604060913705584

I recorded the Little Kidnappers off of the Disney Channel some years ago and love it!  Recently I was given a VHS copy of it and while watching it noticed some (important) scenes were missing.

It seems my copy will be the best one as there is still no US DVD or complete VHS to my knowledge.  SO, beware when purchasing---some scenes are not present.

196325,4,157742154X,"A very appealing cast makes this movie, set in the early 1900s, an enjoyable time.  Charlton Heston plays a gruff old farmer in Nova Scotia who has lost his son in the Boer War in South Africa.  His son's boys come to live with him, their grandmother, and their daughter.

The two boys are wonderfully played by two youngsters, Leo Wheatley and Charles Miller, the daughter is the beautiful Leah Pinsent, and the doctor by Bruce Greenwood.  (Greenwood, who looks like a young Sam Neill, has gone on to have a fine movie career, and can be seen in 'The World's Fastest Indian'.)

Grandfather James MacKenzie bears a hatred of the Boers (Dutch).  The doctor, who falls in love with Kirsten, is a Boer.

The young boys find a surprise on the family beach.

With the exception of the surprise, the plot is a bit predictable, but the set design, the accents, and the acting is top notch.
