8329335,5,B001O4C6S0,"This film was obviously produced as a promotional feature for Crash Corrigan's movie ranch at Corriganville, in the Simi Valley outside of LA. And for fans of Crash and those who love Westerns, it is a window into the past, looking out into a long-gone setting that Western fans will immediately recognize. What fun it would have been to visit Corriganville during its heyday! If you are a fan of the ""Three Mesquiteers"" or ""The Range Busters"" or just about any other B-Western, you will undoubtedly get a kick out of this film.",1507852800,,528,4.688172043010753

8329339,1,B001O4C6S0,"Billed as a total running time of 66 minutes, CORRIGANVILLE The Story of the Ray Corrigan Ranch, only takes up 24 of those sparse minutes. The rest, which the distributor bills as a bonus, is old 1930's and 40's ""B"" western matinee trailers.

The footage of Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan taking you on a tour of his theme park/movie ranch, looks like it was produced in the late 1950's and shot on 16mm. However, it has not been restored and for that reason the color is completely washed out and the audio is just as bad. That said, it's great to see the rare historic Corriganville as it used to be, but it's not been presented in the best light for fans who grew up with memories of the days they saw it all first-hand. A more fitting, professional tribute has yet to be done...",1241568000,5,772,4.361111111111111
