8591807,5,B00DCG3QNW,"Madeleine Lebeau is 110 in the shade.  (Since the death of Joy Page in April 2008, Madeleine LeBeau has been the last surviving cast member of Casablanca.)

Madeleine Lebeau was born in France and fled the Nazis in 1940. She worked in Hollywood during the war years and returned to France after the war.

A movie of about the French resistance in 1943. The Nazis were starting to be pushed back by this time, but France was still fully occupied.

A fast-moving and interesting movie and well acted.  You'll see a few of the actors from Casablanca. (Of course no movie is at the level of Casablanca, including this one.)

Glad to have this in my DVD collection.",1434412800,8,660,4.5508474576271185
