663607,5,6303471757,"""It's not the 1979, so I just hate it because I ordered the wrong one!""  Urrgh!

This version of the classic Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale was produced by Diane Eskenazi and distributed by the unpopular GoodTimes Entertainment studio. ""The Little Mermaid"" (1992) follows the adventures of a sweet, fun-loving little sea girl named Lena, who after a visit to the above world, falls deeply in love with Prince Stefan. Lena then visits the wicked sea-witch Cassandra, who in exchange for Lena's enchanting voice, gives the little mermaid legs to walk on land, warning her that if Prince Stefan were to marry someone other than her, then would Lena be turned into seafoam for all time. Lena then is able to walk on land and when Prince Stefan meets the girl, he too falls in love, unfortunatelly, trouble comes for Lena when Princess Anna is then pressured by her father to marry Stefan.

Like in many other Disney and GoodTimes films, a few sidekicks are added for comic relief and to add a sense of friendship and companionship into the movie; Bink, the dolphin, is Lena's best friend, but at the same time is an important character in the story. Animation quality does not live up to Disney's standards, being a bit rougher and less realistic, but nothing that would make a child enjoy this any less than a Disney film, after all, this films are meant for children and adults viewing should take that into consideration before bashing it. Music, as in many other GoodTimes releases is one of the strengths in this film. Golden Films (The producers) has always done a good job of selecting music for their films, rather than creating a brand new musical soundtrack, timeless classical pieces are added by some of the best and most famous composers of all time. One lovely, original song is included in the opening and instrumentally reprised later on in the film, that song is called ""The World Above"" in which the singer steps into Lena's ""shoes"" and dreams of life by her prince on land.

This film is somewhat hard to find offline, for not many stores carry GoodTimes' line of Collectible Classics. However, finding it online at a price of about $5.95 should be no real challenge. One of the best things about these children's films is that, being so cheap, a small child might just save up to buy them on their own. Overall, memorable and heartwarming Golden Films/GoodTimes fair, I'd recommend it to the very young and the very young at heart.",1154995200,12,2451,4.7330210772833725

663758,5,6303471757,"As several others have mentioned, this is at long last an official US DVD release of the uncut 1975 animated film.

The DVD includes both the original Japanese audio track (with subtitles, and *not* ""dubtitles"") as well as the English dub. The subtitles for the Japanese version are indeed true subtitles and are different from the English dub.

The film is presented in the full ""scope"" ratio of 2.35:1, which was quite surprising. It appears they have done a full, new film transfer for this. The image quality is miles ahead of the old VHS releases, and of course the 2.35:1 picture includes *much* more image area than those old VHS tapes as well. The only gripe I could possibly have about this is that they didn't do a Blu-ray release of this excellent-looking new film transfer.

I'm not sure why Amazon is now carrying over old reviews of old DVD or VHS versions of this film and putting those reviews and ratings under this new Eastern Star DVD release. Other reviews referencing this not being the correct version of the film, or being edited, etc. are incorrect.

This DVD has the uncut film (including a bit of blood and even a few moments of slight nudity). Outside of a Blu-ray release of this same transfer, this is as good of a release of this 1975 film as one could hope for.",1469059200,8,1292,4.556034482758621

663867,5,6303471757,"This is the wonderful 1975 Japanese animation by Toei and released in 2015 on DVD by Eastern Star and Discotek Media.
This animation preserves much of the morality tale told in the classic story by Hans Christian Andersen. There are a few changes but the basic story remains the same. This animation was part of a centennial memorial work in honor of the author.
Like all good stories for children this story is entertaining but also offers much depth and substance for adults. Thoughtful stories, like this one, have characters that must pass through the trials of life. The Little Mermaid is about a character that we can empathize with. Marina is the name of the little mermaid in this animation (interestingly her name was not mentioned in the original story). In addition to the animation, there is a short introduction and conclusion that shows scenes from Denmark, the native country of Hans Christian Andersen.

Characters: As in the original story, the mermaids in this animation are innocently nude. Marina (the little mermaid) is playful and explores the undersea world looking for trinkets. She has a dolphin friend that can talk to her. There are some creepy scavenger creatures around the lair of the evil sea witch. The prince is a likable fellow. This animation has many other characters, but Marina and the prince are the primary characters.

Artwork: The artwork is beautiful! The scenery is a delight to see and the characters are well drawn. The only confusing thing I noticed was an underwater fountain thing that puzzled me. The artwork on the cover of the DVD case is a nice collage of scenes from the animation.

Animation: The animation ranges from average to high quality. Some of the animation was amazing and very difficult to draw and composite in 1975 before computer animation technology. There is a background ""jump"" that is kind of distracting during a running scene in the forest. Overall, the animation is very good!

Quality: The animation is presented in its original widescreen format. The picture quality is very good but it is DVD (not HD Blu-ray). I noticed a thin line that occasionally shows at the bottom perimeter of the animation, but it is not a major problem in my opinion.

Music and Audio: The music is delightful! The opening theme song is only instrumental on the English dubbed audio, but the Japanese audio has nice singing. The English dubbing is quite good and comparable to the original Japanese audio track.

Subtitles: I am glad to have subtitles as an option. They are well synchronized and easy to read. I noticed one miss-type in the subtitles: in one scene the subtitles read, ""...cut out hair."" instead of, ""...cut our hair.""

Credits: The end credits are the same for both the Japanese and English audio tracks.

Menu: The menu is nice, simple, and easy to navigate.

Differences: The story of this animation has some differences from the original story. The most notable difference is that this animation does not include the part of the story when the little mermaid talks to her grandmother about an immortal soul. Also, this animation adds some extra characters such as a friendly dolphin and a cruel cat that makes a secret deal with a pack of ravenous wolves. There is a fight against the renegade wolves. I consider the mildly bloody violence to be ""kid-friendly"", but it was a weird addition to the story. For the most part, this animation is close to the original story, which is as it should be.

Overall: This is a classic animation worth watching! I am happy with my purchase. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys classic stories and wants them to survive for future generations.

End Note: I am worried that some ""modern"" critics may condemn this 1975 animation as not being ""kid friendly"" by modern standards, but I reject such propaganda. This movie was kid-friendly in 1975 and it is kid-friendly now. It is more appropriate for kids than the rude humor and other trash often promoted to them nowadays. This story teaches the classical virtues and challenges kids and adults to think! I am glad that this animation is ""Unrated."" Censors often follow the prevailing winds of propaganda instead of a moral compass. Classic virtues are timeless and transcend various cultures. If this movie is ever rated in the USA, it deserves a family-friendly ""G"" rating.",1452124800,15,4338,4.8724559023066485
663868,5,6303471757,"There are a special group of individuals who grew up watching this version of The Little Mermaid.
And they are the bestest most awesome sauce individuals in the universe.
Back in the 90s, I accidentally came upon the VHS for this film when I was five years old, because the store did not have Disney's version in stock.
I am forever grateful for that day, because this version is of course far superior (and messed me up a bit, but everyone gets messed up in life anyway, right?).
For years (Y E A R S!) I have searched and prayed to every deity in existence for the Japanese dub to become available on dvd in the United States.
I have seen the countless shady-looking dvds on Amazon and was thisclose to buying them, just to see if it was THE one I love so freaking much.
But one fateful day last year, I found out that a small company licensed the Japanese dub.
And I screamed.
Then I cried.
And cried.
And cried some more.
Then screamed some more.
etc.

Thank you to Eastern Star for finally bringing the Japanese dub of this wonderful glorious version of the classic fairy tale to the United States.
