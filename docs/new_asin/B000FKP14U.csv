8124066,3,B000FKP14U,"I had the presumption it was going to be more about the issue of propaganda and advertisement jungle that the T.V. hoists on people to mould their minds...
Turns out this is an introductory level documentary into actual mind control programs that were and are being used in America.  I say introductory because I have watched more documentaries on this subject, things like MK Ultra etc.  This movie really scratches the surface of that whole thing.  So if you are already aware of mk ultra, monarch slaves etc,and such activities, don't waste your money on this dvd.  If you have no clue of those things, then by all means, get introduced.",1403913600,,640,4.738738738738738
8124067,5,B000FKP14U,"Pretty interesting video. Even though events took place in the middle of last century, the picture presented makes you aware what state can do.
Video shows how CIA experimented effects of drugs on public.
Good to know. You don't have to buy it. But, rent if you can or borrow. Watch it at least once.",1223251200,,300,4.472727272727273
8124068,4,B000FKP14U,this dvd was pretty informative about LSD experiments by the cia and erasing peoples memories with electroshock theropy,1191628800,,119,5.666666666666667
8124069,5,B000FKP14U,"Everyone should see this video.  I don't often watch the Discovery Channel, but I'm sorry I missed watching ""Mind Control: America's Secret War"" on an actual television.  After seeing what the CIA has been doing since its inception, and noting that this was actually broadcast, the obvious question presents itself: Why does the CIA still exist?  We know that it's an inept organization, and I even knew that they had done LSD experiments on unwitting subjects, but the CIA is more evil than you can believe.  Reading about it, however, is not like seeing it presented visually, especially when you are able to see one of the victims and hear her story.  This is a spine-chilling video.  Buy one and show it to everyone you know.  My math classes will see it when I need something for the substitute to do.",1156723200,15,806,4.673758865248227
