645100,2,6303442366,"Even for a film from the DeRita era, I found this pretty awful and didn't laugh once, though there are a handful of mildly amusing moments.  I felt really embarrassed for Moe, Larry, and Emil Sitka, even though they do put in good performances in spite of the bad material they were forced to work with.  DeRita I could care less about, and I found him as annoying as I usually do, once again failing to demonstrate any sort of comedic personality or chemistry with the other two.  The length is also a bit of a problem; the Stooges' antics just don't work well in something that's so slow-paced and with a complex plot.  It's such a shame that they didn't get to make full-length starring features till they were well past their comedic prime, though I am happy that Moe and Larry lived long enough to see this surprise mass resurgence of popularity and serious money at last.  They deserved that victory lap in their autumnal years after being cheated for so long by Columbia.  It seems as though it was made primarily to market 'The Three Stooges Scrapbook,' actual footage from which makes up most of the first two reels.  It does start out with some promise, a narration over drawings of what people have envisioned Martians as looking like over the years and then the first Stooges scene before they're kicked out of their apartment for cooking and then covering up the evidence, but it's mostly all downhill from there.

Overall, it just seems like such a devolution and come-down after all of the classic shorts they shot from the Thirties through the Fifties.  It seems so lame, watered-down, childish, embarrassing, a waste of talent, and badly dated.  Among the lamest parts are the Martians, who look like they're wearing rubber masks of Frankenstein's monster instead of being made up to look like halfway believable aliens.  Even for the early Sixties they seem ridiculous and implausible as supposed threatening alien invaders.  There's also a completely lame and pointless love story angle between the professor's daughter and an Air Force captain; at least the romantic subplots in some of their other features worked into the plot more naturally.  This is bad kiddy fare, not timeless classic comedy.  I can understand why a lot of people of a certain age might have nice childhood memories of seeing this in the theatre, but so what?  Most people have sentimental attachments to stuff from their more innocent years, but that doesn't mean those things are of 5-star quality or even very good, nor do they always hold up upon critical re-examination in adulthood.  One's happy memories aren't going to be ruined just because one revisits them without rose-colored glasses.  Apart from kids under the age of ten and nostalgic aging Boomers (who were of that age when they first saw it), I honestly can't see how anyone could find this movie even remotely funny or good.",1188432000,2,2886,4.797979797979798
645101,5,6303442366,"It was 45 years ago when Stooge-mania was riding high with another in the series of feature length movies featuring Larry,Moe and Curly Joe. Our boys were trying to save the planet and in the end the typical hilarious hijinks prevailed. I remember growing up about the incredible flying submarine in this movie and still enjoy it to this day. Fun stuff for every Three Stooges fan!!",1174176000,3,382,4.7164179104477615
645102,5,6303442366,"Gather 'round my friends. That's it make room for everyone. C'mon now kids up in front...everyone comfortable? Can you hear me in the back? Clem, how's your ma doing? Good good. Well folks I've gathered you all here tonight to tell you a tale of intrigue, hope, lost love, sentimental childhood, and the Cold War... That's right Gus, you hit the nail right on the head, The Three Stooges in Orbit.
First off there's the music, that sweet single violin playing those sad notes in a scale of D minor. It always reminded me of the girl I spent one magical summer with on the beach, I'll never forget her.
The plot is rich and has many side stories that the cretons of today's 20 minute SitCom and microwave burritos would fail to appreciate. That being said, let's look at the story and break it down as best we can.....
The Stooges are trying to break into TV amid various problems, sponsor buffoons (""Aw said aw want a whole new type of a cartoon show""), meddling executives (""They'll never make it J.B. They'll never make it"") Obviously the Stooges are attacking Columbia Pictures. The Three Stooges are an American icon who's talant was wasted and taken for granted, while the second rate Abbot and Costello team made millions. I salute thee Mr. Howard, not only for your skill of acting the tragic Greek classics, but also for the violence of Shakespeare.
The Cold War was in full swing by 1962. (This was also the year that Marilyn Monroe died, so like all artists with sentimental hearts, the Stooges had to pay tribute to the fallen goddess.) Notice the general in this movie, see how fat he is, the overflowing girth of a belly. He represented all the fat profiteers who keep the war rumors blowing. The weapon contracts, the spy equipment, the NASA program (who would fake a moon landing just 7 years later using the same special effects from this movie!)The Stooges were pacifists who used this film as a cry out to the world to end it's jealous and violent way. After all, it was Shemp who pinted out in 1953 that 'The War to end all Wars' ended 35 years ago.
Now Ogg and Zogg are interesting characters and there is some argument over their meaning. Some took them as a religious symbol. Moe was Jewish as were his two brothers Shemp and Curly. Were Ogg and Zogg a tribute not only to his late brothers, but a warning that could have been influenced by the Torah? Ignore the subtitles and listen to the actual words of Ogg and Zogg. They are speaking an ancient Arabic tongue and are quoting Dead Sea Scrolls. The guy standing in line behind me at the Salvation Army soup kitchen told me this. He was there when the movie was made, he worked as a grip. He said Ogg and Zogg WERE NOT costumes. He claims to have had relations with the woman who has in the shower scene being frightened by the 'aerosubmatank'. Her real name was Shelly and she died shortly after her second Hollywood appearance as a dancing extra in 'Martian Beach Party'. Apparantly she went into a coma after sampling a super diet version of Dr. Pepper that was never put out on the market.
The Stooges were obviously more than the funniest comedy team that ever existed, they were prophets, scholars and finally martyrs. Ya'll come back soon and I'll tell you of the REAL story behind 'The Three Stooges meet Hercules'.",1075161600,5,3297,4.533557046979865
645103,4,6303442366,"The Three Stooges play themselves as TV stars. After getting kick out of their apartment and a long day of looking for a place to live, the boys meet up with Professor Danfort (Emil Sitka, a regular after the Curly days). The professor has invented a tank/helicopter/submarine vehicle for the military. The Army doesn't want it since it flies, the Air force doesn't want it since it goes under water, etc. The professor has suspected that the Martins want his device for their world and to destroy the earth. Moe, Larry and Curly Joe wind up baby-sitting the contraption, giving it nuclear capability and almost help the Martins in their quest.
If you like the Three Stooges you will enjoy this movie.

645104,2,6303442366,"This is not your typical Three Stooges short.  This is a full length feature film.  The beginning is inspirational, starting with images of classic pen and ink drawings of Martians, with a Mike Wallace-type narrative.  What follows is a typical Three Stooges routine, regarding hotel regulations against cooking, and the Three Stooges' quest for finding a new place to live.  Eventually, the trio finds residence in a scientist's home, where they view his invention (a flying submarine) and discover spies from Mars.  The scientist is on the verge of successfully marketing his invention to the U.S. military.  The Three Stooges successfully derail the Martians' attempt to take over the earth.  The narrative builds up slowly, with amusing footage of a small mockup of the flying submarine, and then, the actual flying submarine, and eventually, footage of an actual atomic bomb blast over the Pacific Ocean.  The flying submarine is the size of a mobile home, and it is actually shown to fly.  It is a Rube Goldberg gadget, with the charm of the Beatles' Yellow Submarine.  It is shown to fly over the Egyptian pyramids, over New York City, over Athens, and over San Francisco.  The film is reminiscent of Speilberg's zany and astonishing movie, 1941, as well as of the clever and heartwarming The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000), featuring Jason Alexander and Robert DeNiro.  But please save your money and use it, instead, for buying 1941 or for the 2000 production of Rocky and Bullwinkle.  Despite its ambitious qualities, the film under review has some detracting qualities.  Although Three Stooges in Orbit has some clever moments, e.g., the exchange of the submarine's carburator for an atomic bomb about to be tested in the desert, and some amusing moments, e.g., when the flying submarine flies past a laundry line, thereby propelling a woman's brassiere into the face of a U.S. military general, there are some problems.  First of all, the martians are ugly and irritating to look at.  They are obviously just actors in rubber Frankenstein masks.  How uncreative.  If the martians had the typical Roswell, Arizona appearance, then I'd give this movie a higher rating.  Another problem, a minor one, is the scene showing Curly repeatedly being hit on the head with a crowbar being shoved through a wall.  This is not amusing.  Another problem is that the film tries to be a monster movie and a science fiction movie at the same time.  Much of the story takes place in the scientist's scary castle.  Perhaps it would have been better for these sequences to take place in a university laboratory, e.g., at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Please recall that the Three Stooges do have one film short taking place in a college laboratory: ""Violent is the Word for Curly"" (1938), one of the cleverest and funniest of all Three Stooges shorts.  In Violent is the Word for Curly, the Three Stooges are mistaken for elitist college professors.  And so, it might have been nice for Three Stooges in Orbit to be based in a college laboratory.  Also the sound is bad.  There are cracklings throughout.  These irritating crackling sounds can also be found in abundance in the video version of the story of Alexander Graham Bell, featuring Don Ameche.",1068940800,2,3266,4.963167587476979

645106,5,6303442366,This is some of the best stuff the Stooges ever did even though it doesn't have the great stooges like Curly and Shemp. It has Curly-Joe. I have to be honest. I didn't like Joe Besser as a Stooge at all but Curly-Joe has heart. He fits in very well with Moe and Larry. I don't want to go into detail with the movie because I don't want to ruin it. All I can say is that this is classic 3 Stooges slapstick material. If I made a video of the best Stooge moments I would be using this video quite a bit.

645546,1,6303442366,"Let me start by saying I own the complete set of Stooges short features.  I also have seen their support work in most of the features they did while at Colombia.  Much of their stuff is brilliant.  I picked up ""The Three Stooges In Orbit"" at Big Lots clearance store for (I think) $5.
I am reminded of the inferior nature of Laurel and Hardy's material once they were excluded from the creation process; so that the resident studio geniuses ""with a greater sense of what is funny and popular"" could work their magic, and ensure maximum return on investment to the studio.  Naturally, what resulted was insipid, not natural to the performers, punctuated with tacky background music (melodramatically emphasizing ""This scene is comical"", ""This scene is ironic"", ""This scene is romantic"", or at least trying to), and beyond the suspension of disbelief - necessary to some degree even in comedy.  The result is a very contrived product, and I believe this movie suffers from that problem.
With respect to Moe's son-in-law, Norman Maurer, who was co-writer of this thing, what can one say about a movie where aliens who are intent on destroying the earth end up dancing ""the twist"" at the end of the movie?
Is an all-in-one submarine/tank/helicopter desirable (or plausible) in the wildest stretch of the imagination?  Isn't it rather a step backward for anyone capable of interplanetary travel?
Zogg and Ogg???  Isn't trying to get comedy from the martians' names milking things a bit dry?  It seems like people with no concept of comedy tried to put together a script which would be the funniest thing ever.
Oh, look, somebody has just carefully laid out a bunch of pies while the Stooges are wreaking havoc in front of some distinguished army brass. I wonder what's going to happen next?
Another invention by the professor (to produce animation from live action) requires the stooges to wear martian-style make-up???  Having them do the twist in animation is supposed to be so entertaining as to keep their show from being cancelled????
My finger was itching to hit the fast forward, but I wanted to be fair to the material.  After all, it was the Stooges, so I let it play out.  But never before watching the Three Stooges was I very happy when the words ""The End"" appeared.

When I began to watch ""The Three Stooges in Orbit"" it became obvious that this film was going to be a let down from their earlier films.

Barely humorous dialog.  Example:
Moe: ""Quite a cozy place you got here.""
Professor: ""Thank you. Great-grandfather built it over 100 years ago.""
Curly Joe: ""No! It doesn't look a day over 98!""

Physical comedy lacks finesse.  Examples:
Curly Joe is hit in the forehead twice by a thrown portable electric range.
Landlady is hit in the face by an egg that magically flies out of a refrigerator.
Air Force Officers continue to stand on the tarmac as they are pelted by pies knocked into the air by helicopter blades.

Missed opportunity for comedy:  After Curly Joe accidentally hits the ""orbit"" button, the Stooges pass-out from the acceleration.  While they are unconscious, their all-purpose military vehicle makes a couple of chaotic loops around the moon (their path indicated by a dashed line) and returns to Earth.  Alas, they could have had a lot of fun with this.

One funny bit:  A pretty young woman is enjoying her bubble bath next door, when the professor's model vehicle flies through the window, splashes down, and flutters around in her suds.  Not knowing what it is, she begins bashing it with her brush, then jumps up wrapping a towel around herself.  To her horror, she suddenly becomes aware of the leering Stooges enjoying the show from their window above.  The Stooges quickly feign a smiling modesty.

While Curly Joe is no Curly or Shemp, he's better than Joe, and he has many fine moments spread throughout the film.  The film works very well.

645549,5,6303442366,"THE THREE STOOGES (five stooges total) were 40 years into their historic comedy careers by the time the 1960s rolled around. That long already! (They started in vaudeville). Never ending the zaniness, they tirelessly kept working to entertain us for the rest of their lives. Moe's son-in-law was the producer of their 1950s/60s movies, and he came up with the idea for ""Three Stooges In Orbit.""

A wacky old scientist is suspicious that spies from outer space are hiding in his castle/laboratory where he makes a super new weapon-vehicle: a flying sub with wheels and a laser ray. He wants to sell it to the military - any branch - it can go anywhere. His lovely daughter has faith in her father's inventiveness.

The Stooges meet him, and come to stay (after getting kicked out of their own apartment) and yikes! they soon see spooks and monsters at the scientist's place.

Are there really alien monsters lurking who want to take over the Earth? Will the Stooges accidentally take off in the contraption and reek havoc? See for yourself, nitwit numbskull !",1256860800,2,1058,4.802197802197802
645550,3,6303442366,"Pretty much what you would expect from the crazy antics of The Three Stooges.  Moe Howard and Larry Fine reprise their roles from the early Columbia short subject days.  Joe DeRita takes over the third stooge part from cry baby Joe Besser, who, to put it bluntly, just plain sucked in that role.

DeRita at least *somewhat* resembles Moe's younger brother Jerry (who played ""Curly"" in the original short subjects from Columbia).  Curly is and always will be most everyone's favorite stooge, earning the title ""Super Stooge.""

The Three Stooges in Orbit is entertaining but predictable.  Of the full length ""feature"" movies Columbia released featuring the Stooges, all released in the early 1960's, only one was bad:  STOP, LOOK AND LAUGH! just plain sucked.

I also have ""The Three Stooges Meet Hercules"" and ""The Three Stooges Go Around The World in a Daze.""  The only one I regret buying is ""Stop, Look and Laugh"" which featured butchered bits of the original Columbia shorts wrapped around by Paul Winchell and his two dummies.  It is sickening and insult to the Stooges and their fans.",1253232000,8,1089,4.901639344262295

645555,4,6303442366,"Poking fun at sci-fi movies and Martian invasions (both done sillier in their own right), the Stooges do a film-within-a-film as they play themselves as T.V. stars getting involved in some weird doings.
Winding up at the mansion of a kooky but well-intended professor (Stooge short veteran Emil Sitka), it's soon revealed that actual Martians are hiding away in the place as they await the completion of the professor's latest invention: an odd-looking helicopter-tank-submarine-rocket which the professor hopes to sell to the military. A demonstration goes predictably disastrous with the Stooges behind the wheel, as they demolish army facilities and then take a ""joy ride"" across the countryside---even managing to accidentally attach an atom bomb during repairs! Eventually, the boys clash with the Martians and thwart their plans to destroy Earth, while saving their jobs at the T.V. studio. The film closes with an outrageous gag: on a T.V. screen broadcasting from Mars, the Chief Martian declares in perfect English: ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!"" Then the Martians do a wild 60's version of the Twist!
""Orbit"" is utterly preposterous in idea & story construction---but who cares? After all, this is a Three Stooges movie we're talking about; it was never meant to be taken seriously, just enjoyed. Even the romantic subplot is tinged with subtle touches of humor as misunderstandings abound.
And satire abounds in this caper as the Martians are vulnerable to the Stooges' wild slapstick. It's a real hoot to hear the Martians call each other ""idiots!"" in their own tongue.
The film was obviously influenced by the Cold War/Cuban Missile Crisis (it was made in 1962) in its inclusion of enemy invasions, nuclear bombs and destruction.
""Orbit"" may be a silly concoction, but like much of the Stooges' 60's films, is fun to watch!",1201392000,8,1840,5.136666666666667

7846929,5,6303442366,"A long time ago in the late 1990s, in the age of video tapes and renting them at video stores like Blockbuster, my dad and I rented good film series like Godzilla, Abbott & Costello, and of course the Three Stooges. It was Three Stooges in Orbit that made me a fan of the Stooges to this day. So many good memories from my boyhood. Sure it was an old film, but it was funny to watch as a kid. I still have the old video tape, but in an age where home entertainment goes digital I finally decided to say goodbye to my video tape and switch to DVD. I know I could have gone further and go digital like Amazon Video or Google Play but that will be another time for that. For now I'll just enjoy the DVD.",1494201600,,700,3.971631205673759
