8169891,1,B000MLH99C,"Before you see this film, please take a second to investigate the ""experts"" who have discovered hidden signs in these old religious artifacts. Reisman, for instance has been on the warpath against the Kinsy Institute for decades, she is a guest professor of Law at Liberty University, her report to the Dept of Justice (1986), was the result of her combing thru hundreds of issues of Playboy, Hustler and Penthouse to find images of child pornography, of which she found an Astounding amount -according to her report. That report was widely criticised, of course, by real experts for being a ""scientific disaster, riddled with researcher bias and baseless assumptions"" and was deemed ""meaningless"". She has also claimed that gay people employ recruitment techniques that rival those of the United States Marine Corps and she blames the Nazi Party and the Holocaust on gays. But she is just one of the few 'experts' providing the data for this film, and maybe the sanest, if you can believe that.

This film is the wing-nut equivalent of a hunt for Big Foot. Finding the devil present at every stroke of the bush in ancient religious art, much like every twig snap can be claimed to come from Sasquatch, if that is what you are looking for.",1446681600,,1239,4.816901408450704

8169893,3,B000MLH99C,"I learned a lot after watching this tape.  I didn't realize just how much of the religious art was not so religious.  Some of the things he pointed out, I agreed with and others I did not.  There was one Catholic church he previewed that had this demonic looking webbing and the marble had demonic looking faces in the lines.  I think he was right on point with that one because, even though I'm Catholic, I realized that I would not be able to attend that church because of how much it gave me the creeps.
Now for the reason for giving this 3 stars.  I was so absorbed in learning what he had to say the first time I watched it that I didn't realize the undertone that was going on throughout the DVD.  When I watched it a second time, I realized that he was having a snit because he had been turned down for filming in the cathedrals in Toronto.  If you can look past that, and with my first viewing I did, then you will actually learn a lot about art.  You don't have to agree with everything he points out but I believe he was correct with 90 to 95 percent of what he was talking about.",1385769600,2,1090,4.1084905660377355
8169894,5,B000MLH99C,"The two-one star reviewers are sheep and their eyes will never be opened no matter what they see.
There is hidden meaning and subliminal material in most everything that is ""sold"" to the people, including religion.
Religion is the biggest controlling factor for humanity and it has only caused wars and bloodshed.
It is impossible for anyone to get along as long as they think their so called ""god"" is better than anyone elses' god.
Get over the hundreds of religions that has been re-written hundreds of times by ""kings"" and leaders of the sheeple.
Get free and quit being brainwashed you mASSES. Go read a Penn Jillette book, and quit acting holier than thou.",1370995200,,661,4.756521739130434
8169895,1,B000MLH99C,"This film starts out with a story about how Michael A Calace (""writer, director, actor, inventor"") was refused permission to shoot a movie in the Archdiocese of Toronto. Convinced he was the victim of some evil conspiracy, he starts to investigate the Archdiocese's website and finds examples of what he believes to be hidden pornographic and satanic messages in its artwork. As he continues his ""investigation"" he realises this is a worldwide phenomenon and the viewer is treated to over two hours of examples. A few of these (including some renaissance artworks) may really have hidden messages in them, but most of them are just plain nonsense, about as credible as TBN's expos of backwards messages in rock music. Calace even claims that a renaissance era painting depicts Vladimir Putin and his wife and that this proves the painter had some evil, supernatural guidance. After all of this nonsense, he calls these alleged messages with ""rape of the soul"" and compares them to actual rape, which is a slap in the face of actual rape victims.

""Rape of the Soul"" offers some insight into the deluded religious mind of its director, and a few laughs, but nothing else, and is certainly not worth spending 140 minutes of your life on, let alone money to pay for it.",1363132800,6,1266,4.8341013824884795

Oh, and did I mention penises. They seem to be all over the catholic faith.

A waste of time. Funny and bizarre. But a waste of time.",1349740800,6,307,4.5636363636363635
