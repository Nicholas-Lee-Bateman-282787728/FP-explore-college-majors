5340715,5,B009ISQ3DI,"This documentary is one that should be used an instruction for all believers.  It shows how we can affect our sphere of influence in practical ways and motivates the watcher to go and demonstrate the Kingdom.  This movie has changed my life like no other.  It has birthed a heart for people inside of me like I cannot explain.

You will be changed forever after watching this.",1350345600,,376,4.567164179104478
5340716,5,B009ISQ3DI,"Father of Lights will reveal how much Father/Daddy/Abba loves you. If you have a misconception of God or view God as a harsh Father, this documentary is a significant tool to demolish those beliefs! Also, Father of Lights will increase your faith tenfold or at least it did for me. =)",1350345600,,284,4.588235294117647
5340717,5,B009ISQ3DI,"I personally liked Furious Love the best of all three movies, that being said, this movie is incredible.  Buy all three movies and watch from start to finish.  My only issue is that I wish Darren would continue to do these movies as they are life changing.",1350345600,2,256,4.425531914893617
5340718,5,B009ISQ3DI,This was one of the most amazing documentaries I have ever seen! I felt like I had traveled the world with Darren and knew these peope first hand - it was so real and engaging. This video has compelled me to be a better witness of God's love to those I come across.  He loves them - I need to.  Time to take God of of the box!,1350345600,,326,3.7794117647058822
5340719,5,B009ISQ3DI,"This is the most impactful so far of the three films Darren Wilson has made. I didn't think he could rock my world, but he did - God did - again. To see the miracles and divine connections God sets up to introduce man to the Kingdom is most amazing! Loved this movie and would suggest it to every person, not just Christians.",1350345600,,325,4.174603174603175
5340720,5,B009ISQ3DI,"Father of Lights is a fantastic movie.  It will open your eyes to exactly who God is and what His nature is.  I have watched it numerous times and every time I notice something new.  I wish there was a way that every single person on the planet could see this movie.

So many people think that God is a white haired, angry, judge who is waiting to whack you with a hammer at every turn.  But Father of Lights reveals the truth about a loving Father who will do anything to reveal His love to people.

This is by far the best movie of the series, and that says a lot because the first two movies were incredible too.",1350345600,,615,4.083333333333333
5340721,5,B009ISQ3DI,"You will not be the same after watching this film. It is an incredible, unexpected journey with God. If you are wondering if God exists or if He loves you this movie will answer you. I can't recommend it highly enough!",1350345600,,218,4.341463414634147
5340722,5,B009ISQ3DI,This film blew my mind. It was an incredible testimony of God's love and faithfulness to His people.

I HIGHLY recommend watching - it's something you will never forget.,1350345600,,270,4.74468085106383

5340729,4,B009ISQ3DI,"I read the negative comments here and I appreciate them. Pretty much everything that the 1 & 2-star reviewers said can be somewhat justified [that is the ones that make ANY sense at all].  However I think they missed the outstanding Point of the documentary - which point the producer may have not even planned.  NO matter what 'wing' of Christian opinion one comes from [including Christian-haters/bashers/objectors], you will find yourself questioning your own biases, examining their motives and your own, and wondering why you feel so ... well, conflicted!

What I liked:
The producer/director/editor chose quite a variety of scenes/themes to include [and exclude... must have been a lot of material], and it works. Something for everybody.  If you come from a Cessationist bias, you'll definitely be provoked to resentment - a good thing because you Need to be provoked.
I liked the way the ""conflict"" between different ""kinds of Christian witness"" in the Beach scene was handled.  Everybody was wrong in that encounter:  all sides. And that's good to show because I found myself in the midst of them all, caught between criticism and pathos, knowing full well that Jesus pointedly DEMANDED that we love our Christian brothers [et al]; with no wiggle room.
I liked feeling uncomfortable with how some 'ministry' was carried out.  Hey - did you know that the Christian faith did not explode from the safe bunkers of high theological training? [what am I thinkin'!]. The POINT is for me to be uncomfortable and willing to suffer humiliation and degradation for one clear goal:  Obey Jesus.
I liked that somehow the camera folk, editor, et al were able in nearly every scene to capture the emotion and heart of their subjects, on all sides.  Yes it is emotional..... we're dealing with the ONE ISSUE in life that takes precedence over all others! It jolly well should be emotional.
I liked the way it moves at a brisk pace and has no real ending.  In fact if it were up to me I would have ended differently but its OK, as you definitely get the sense of ""well - that's all for NOW but the work moves on""
I like that the Heart of a Dangerously Generous Father is everywhere evident in this documentary. He is so generous, so kind, so willing to forgive [Read Jonah] that you wonder if He is sane or not.  Somebody has to stop Him or He'll just forgive ANYBody, and bless the One person that You so want Him to FRY!

What I disliked [sorta]:
- The film definitely comes across as being a product from a ""Western Whiteboy Non-Denominational Neo-Charismatic"" source. This is forgivable because it isn't about Western Christianity really.
- Inclusion of some ""professional ministers"" is part of the story, but those included come from a historically miniscule subset of world Christianity. Maybe the original intent of this was to ""play to the home crowd"" of one tiny sliver of the Faith, but this is for everybody. I would have been sure to screen the film with a  wide variety of known voices from every quarter of Christian ministry worldwide, and seek a representative cross-section of ministerial comment. Especially from ministers like the Bishop of Aleppo, who have literally put their lives at risk every single day to carry on the work of Christ in circumstances that are unbearable for mere mortals.",1494288000,,3306,4.819787985865724

5340737,4,B009ISQ3DI,"Loved this documentary! So many amazing stories about God's supernatural presence! One scene is filmed in a dance club to show that even though this is not a wholesome atmosphere, these people still are loved by Jesus and need the Holy Spirit. I liked that aspect of the scene but did not like that an exotic dancer on a trapeze was filmed to show what kind of atmosphere this was. I felt this was an unnecessary distraction from the rest of this wonderful film and also exploited this girl even more than she already was. This also exposes people who are striving to know the Lord better and keep their hearts pure with unnecessary temptation.  The problem was more than how she was dressed but that she was moving seductively upside down on a trapeze  while wearing very little. It would be helpful if this film was rated so parents have a heads up and can screen this part of the film so their kids don't see it.",1485734400,6,915,4.440476190476191

5340775,1,B009ISQ3DI,"Starts with some guy in India who wakes up at 4:30am IST to wander and preach because god speaks to him.  Jumps to California with some guy who preaches by apparently reading tattoos.  Then the director talks about other people on Venice beach ""killing his holy spirit mojo"".  Then he starts preaching to other evangelists

They show lots of pastors and other folks babbling.  Seems like a bunch of manipulative con artists.  Indicative that Ravi keeps his face hidden.",1464048000,,469,4.8734177215189876

5340822,1,B009ISQ3DI,"I was given this movie by a man who comes into my workplace roughly once a week, who has been devoutly praying for me to one day ""accept the lord"". I grew up in a christian home, and kind of just went through the motions. I told the man I was interested in finding God's love, and so he gave me this movie.

The longer I watched this movie, the more disappointed I was. The narrator described his adventures with a man named Ravii or something who (according to Ravii) could hear God audibly... Ravii claimed that God would wake him up everyday at 4:00 and give him specific orders for the day.
The narrator took you through the conversions of several people by Ravii, all who accepted christ after a few words and a simple prayer.

This whole movie is just a logical fallacy appealing to emotion. It tries to make you all warm inside because people across the world are ""finding god."" This movie uses many interviews (appeal to authority - another logical fallacy) from various amounts of people, who all claim finding this god and finding some euphoric love, yet they don't even know anything about this god in which they worship. Their lives are s***ty and so they as a repentance from their self-generated misfortune they accept God as their savior. This movie is great if you want to learn nothing about God, if you want a nice warm sob story than I highly recommend.

1/5 stars.

God also gave favor to two of his servants. One servant was able to witness to the guru by this river where only the guru sits. The second servant was able to enter the Dome of the Rock and speak the name of Jesus inside. There were also mini interviews with Christian leaders in the DVD.

5340947,1,B009ISQ3DI,"Awful.  Just awful.  It's like ""What if Criss Angel Became a Street Preacher."" This is like a parody of hip, feel-good bro/dude rockin' knucklehead Christianity one might see on King of the Hill.  But it's real.  Good grief.  43 minutes in, I wish I could get a get a sound byte of Robbie saying ""Two bags of dope there baby...FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD...cuz thass how our God rolls...  Blecch!  And then there's Ravi in India, who God talks to every day at 4am and whom Ravi calls ""Daddy"".  At around the 45 minute mark, it is revealed to Ravi by ""Daddy"" that he should talk to some stranger described as ""white beard, orange robe, with a turban on his head"".  Bear in mind this is occurring at an ""enormous temple"" in India. IN INDIA.  Yep, and they're amazed and overwhelmed that after they ""walked...and searched...and looked around"" lo and behold they find a guy with a white beard wearing a robe and turban, IN INDIA, and are totally convinced they've accomplished something unheard-of.  COME ON!!!  But seriously.  You wanna know what God and Christianity is all about?  Read the bible.  Turn from your sins.  Pray for forgiveness.  Accept Jesus.  Do some good works too, while you're at it.  But don't forget that part about renouncing sins (""Go and sin no more"") cuz there are a lot of people nowadays saying there's no such thing as sin.  There is.  Jesus died to save you from your sins.  If sin doesn't exist, Jesus died for nothing.  It's all about God's grace: you can't earn it.  You don't deserve it.  He gives it to those who strive for it.  Read the bible and pray for faith and it can be yours.",1412812800,11,1610,4.484429065743945

All of the stories played out in this documentary are pretty amazing to watch. The conversion of a hindu maharishi guru was particularly heartwarming to me (I'd describe more, but don't want to give spoilers!). The scenes shot in Jerusalem and the way their time there unfolded was absolutely incredible. The first time I watched it, my hand flew up to my gaping mouth and I gasped out loud.

5341003,5,B009ISQ3DI,I got this DVD in less than a week. As a believer in Christ and this is the best DVD I own. It just proves how God can move mountains when we trust in him. It also shows how much he loves us and wants others to know about him and his gift of heaven to those who accept him as their Lord and Master.,1403481600,,298,3.6
5341004,3,B009ISQ3DI,"This film contained several amazing stories of Christians sacrificially serving and loving others with incredible faith. At points, it focused me on the love of the Father for His children. Those aspects were both inspiring and convicting.

My issue with the film was that woven into the stories were two things that gave me pause:

The first concern I had was that the film immediately drew a false dichotomy between God's holiness and his grace, and seemed to suggest that as believers we have no right to alert non-Christians to the reality of the separation that their sin has created between them and God, or God's wrath, or God's displeasure with their willful rejection of his Son. In fact, it asserted that all people, redeemed or not, are ""children of God"", and that our commonality with the lost rests on that basis. That notion is flatly at odds with Scripture. It also implied that those who preach on judgment are being disobedient and unloving, and that they are actually an impediment to the Gospel. I think we need to be wise/sensitive/Spirit-led about how we present the Good News in different settings with different people, but to suggest that pointing to God's holiness and wrath is categorically wrong is dangerous and unbiblical.

My second concern was the parade of cameos by leaders in the Charismatic movement, and the conflating of these figures and their rather esoteric doctrinal postures with the more doctrinally uncontroversial, loving, attractive stories I mentioned previously. Because the more alarming aspects of the activities of these figures went completely unremarked upon, I can only assume this was an intentional decision on the part of the filmmakers to disarm viewers and consequently to interest them in those ministries. Yet visit the website of Doug Addison, one of the featured prophetic types, and you'll find content that is (barely) one step removed from popular celebrity psychics.

There's a long section with street healer Todd White. I'll just say this. Jesus restored a man's visually withered hand to wholeness. He made leprosy disappear. He called a decomposing dead man out of the tomb. In public. Immediately. ""Healers"" of the kind featured here spend an inordinate amount of time healing bad backs, sore knees, chronic headaches, bad eyesight, and poor hearing. Always maladies that are not visual in nature. I went to see a well-known ""healer"" one time, and I observed something interesting. The license plates in the parking lot were from all over the country, so people were obviously desperate and traveling for help. All of the individuals with visible impairments were kept off to the side of the stage, and never called up. They were prayed for privately. Those on the stage? Bad backs, bad hearing, sore shoulders, etc.

God is an infinite being with prerogatives. You can't harness His power like electricity.",1403049600,,2879,5.078224101479916

5341008,5,B009ISQ3DI,"I watched the finger of God when I was flipping through channels on my television. Towards the end I got down on my knees and prayed to  Heavenly Father for Him to use me to help others, with a heart eager to serve him and be a part of this type of thing. A week later a man with a family of about 9 came into my work radical for God. I work in a very small town in Johnstown Ohio. I was at the register ready to take his order. He pointed at my cross and said, I like your necklace there. My smile got bigger, and I replied, ""I knew it, I could sense that you were a believer, then went on to take his order. As I was, I kept hearing a voice; a reoccurring thought: refer the movie to him, refer it to him, refer it, go ahead, it's okay, don't be nervous, refer it to him. So when I was finished taking his order I asked, can I refer a movie to you? He said, Yeah is it the Finger of God? !!! I said, yeah how did you know? He said, ""Because God told me,"" I said God told you?"" He said, Yeah and you know what else, he told me to tell you that you're doing a good job, just keep it, and that he loves you so much, and  This year he's going to use you in a big way, not necessarily healing, ut it's going to be big, this coming year is going to be huge for you. He's working on an intimate relationship with you, and you're going to start feeling him like never before. It's going to start in your hands and you're going to fell him on your face, but don't be scared or worried, it's just God loving on you."" !!!!WOW I stopped him right there, and said, I know exactly what you mean, because I've already started to feel tingles in my hands when I talk about him. It's happened a couple times over the past few moths, and also, even crazier...last night I was laying in bed for two hours. I could not sleep. Finally, I prayed to Heavenly Father to come and comfort me. Within less than a minute I felt this warmth come over my entire body slowly until it was heat. My whole body was just..heat. There was an intense pressure in my brain, just like when I had tripped on DMT. Only with DMT, I hallucinated and it lasted 15 minutes. So I was thinking, kinda worried, and extremely shocked, laying in bed with my body full of heat and feeling this intense DMT-like pressure in my brain, I thought: ""What's going to happen next? is God going to take me to a different realm? Is He going to just bamb, knock me out because He knows I need rest? Well I stopped my questioning and just said continuously, I trust you, I trust you, I trust you. This feeling remained for a few minutes until it slowly subsided away from me. I tried to rationalize it logically thinking, well maybe it was the temperature outside had gone up, or inside the temp had raised, but how does that explain the peace and complete comfort I had with the things that only Heavenly Father knows was bothering me?  I woke up feeling rested, at peace, and eager to serve the Lord, for the Love He had shown me. However I tended to sway in my belief that it was real. I kept doubting...Then this random guy at work, the very next day, practically prophesied to me, reassured me, that it was real, that is was just God showing he loves me.!!!! Wow. Now, it gets even weirder believe it or not. And I just want to say before I mention anything else. There is no such thing as coincidence or chance when you leave room for God to work in your life. This gentleman's name was Chuck. He introduced me to his daughter after I took his order. Her name was Abbey and she was going with the blond woman in Finger of God to Africa to heal people! When I went back to work, I had this prompting-this idea to give her a gift, but what am I going to give her, a medium fry? Keep in mind I am at Burger King. Then I catch a glimpse at a shimmer from my ring. My ring was a pair of wings. Give this to her, I heard in my mind, but I thought, awe well it's kind of special between me and God, but then I heard again, no go and give it to her as a gift. So I went out to the dining room once again and gave her the ring. I said to her, ""When you go to Africa, and if you ever feel down or doubt, just know of your resting place, your safe place, and hiding place is in the shadow of the wings of Jesus. She lit up and her dimples reached her ears. Then her dad, Chuck said, That's  our family scripture! ! Once again, NOT  a coincidence. I am thankful for the knowledge of the gospel, I believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the Book of  Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ. I love this book, I love the Bible, I love the Church of Jesus Christ, I love these movies, and I love my savior, and my Heavenly Father with all my heart. Amen",1401667200,2,4698,4.008537886872999

5341032,3,B009ISQ3DI,"I've seen all of the movies in this trilogy.  This is my least favorite.  My only complaint is that the director spends a little too much time on scenes of unfocused swirling light.  The extra footage (samples of which are available online) indicates that the film itself could have been more substantive.  I suspect this is a strategy to sell the much more expensive extended edition when it becomes available.

5341049,3,B009ISQ3DI,"Darren spends the first third of this film getting irritated with some people who don't evangelize in just the way he's comfortable with.  They walk around with signs that quote actual scripture, but he's not crazy about those particular passages, I guess, because he seems to think they shouldn't be doing it.  He condescends to pray with some of these unenlightened folks when he realizes he is judging them.

Perhaps it would be more fitting if he asked them to pray for him.  They've been doing a difficult and unrewarding job for over 20 years in obedience to God, just as Darren is doing what he does in obedience to God.  How dare he judge them and spend too much of this video justifying his position.  God works in mysterious ways.  He uses the most surprising things.  And, He is responsible for those uncomfortable scriptures being in the Bible, so Darren should take up his objections with Him and leave those poor folks alone.

Otherwise the film was fine.  We have to take his word for all the miracles, but I'm ok with that.  I find his personality a bit grating, is all, but I think he means well.",1386460800,,1113,4.542713567839196

5341054,5,B009ISQ3DI,This movie is ESSENTIAL for every Christian to see! I love Darren's heart in this movie! He is a reformed evangelical...not in a Calvinistic sense...but in a supernatural sense! You can see his own journey with knowing this supernatural God more intimately come to a more full understanding through Father of Lights. This is the most encouraging movie I have ever seen...EVER!,1384646400,,376,5.080645161290323
5341055,5,B009ISQ3DI,Darren Wilson's movies are about the only reason I still have a dvd player. I put one in whenever I need to feel refreshed. He captures God moving so well in the earth. Darren's movies were one of the things God directed me to watch as my life began to be transformed. In fact it transformed so much I wrote my own book called Overflowing Success to document the changes. We welcomed home a beautiful and healthy baby boy after struggling for years to conceive. We also paid off our mortgage in just one year. As Darren shows - it's amazing to see what happens when you stop trying to figure everything out and you just open up and let God work in your life. Watch all of his movies and see what starts to happen in your own life!,1384214400,,730,4.2214285714285715
5341056,5,B009ISQ3DI,"If you know anything about world religions and the mosque in Jerusalem known as the ""Dome of the Rock"", then you know absolutely without a doubt, that no one has ever been allowed inside the ""Dome of the Rock"" except for Muslims since 2004.  This film shows one of the most amazing miracles ever caught on camera.  If you don't want to know the miraculous ending of this film, then don't continue reading this review.  I've studied world religions extensively for the past 13 years and have become so enlightened and amazed by the ending of this film, that I must post this review.  To this day at the ""Dome of the Rock"" the Muslim world has allowed Christians to only walk around the outside of the mosque, but they have a stated law that bans even the reading of the Bible (or Tanakh), and praying to the Christian GOD on these grounds outside of the mosque.  Someone reading a bible or praying around the mosque is subject to immediate removal, or even worse.  Todd White, who couldn't appear to be more non-muslim than any other human being on earth, actually enters ""the Dome of the Rock"" on camera and prays to his FATHER GOD verbally on Camera in THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.  This is absolutely a jaw dropping miracle.  Even on the ceiling of the ""Dome of the Rock"" is a verse from the Q'uran stating that GOD has no SON.  This is a statement the Q'uran teaches against THE TRINITY (1 John 5:7, Isaiah 9:6, 7:14 written about 700 B.C.) as they claim GOD cannot be ""WE"", because ""WE"" shows weakness, therefore GOD could not have a SON according to the Q'uran which was written thousands of years after GOD REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS ""US"" in Genesis 1:26-27 (recorded about 1440 B.C., with roots back to about 4,000 B.C. according to Jewish History).  Here on camera, not only do multiple Christians enter the ""Dome of the Rock"", but Todd White even prays to GOD calling HIM his own FATHER on camera in the mosque (according to 1 John 3:1-10), declaring the act of LOVE GOD bestowed upon all mankind who believes in HIM (Romans 3:23, 6:23, 10:9), that HE LITERALLY CAME TO EARTH AS JESUS CHRIST AND SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR us, adopting all of us who believe as HIS own children (John 3:16-17).  Therefore to me, to know that the ending of this film actually occurred, you really must see to see it to believe it.  This miracle absolutely could not be staged knowing the differences between Islam and Christianity.  Wow, surely there is A HIGHEST POWER ORDAINING HIS WAY on earth amongst the will of the world.",1383868800,37,2507,4.532150776053215

The most important thing that was amplified through Father of Lights though was how much more can be accomplished through showing the love of Christ to those who need it instead of being self righteous, condescending, or judgmental.

5341064,5,B009ISQ3DI,"I first encountered Darren Wilson through his feature film, Finger of God, in which he captured multiple supernatural miracles of God on camera in an exciting documentary-style demonstration of God's involvement with humanity. His film, Furious Love, continued that story of God's love and immanence. And Darren's newest film, Father of Lights, wraps up this film trilogy with some of the most encouraging and exciting charismatic Christian footage I have seen.

This film expresses what it looks like to be a friend of God through documentary interviews and excursions with many of God's close friends. As the film crew travels the world to visit with both known and lesser known Christian ministers, people encounter God, are healed, and recognize the warmth of God's passionate love. There is also a particularly excellent scene where the film crew is able to film inside the Dome of the Rock, which is unheard of for Christians, but possible through the loving and miracle-working Father God.

5341067,5,B009ISQ3DI,We have been having viewing parties. Can't get enough of this video! Keep buying them and giving them away. Would be a great video to show at church to get everyone out in the streets.,1379030400,,184,4.285714285714286
5341068,5,B009ISQ3DI,"I recently went to Uganda on a missions trip, and I can attest to what this documentary reveals about how God is still actively working in hearts of those around the world. He loves everyone deeply, and is still doing miracles in people's lives.",1378771200,,245,4.590909090909091
5341069,5,B009ISQ3DI,"Father of Lights is the most amazing film I have ever seen. All of Darren Wilson's films have left a permanent mark my life, because they point to a relationship with God and with a version of Christianity that is alive, vibrant, filled with power and love. In other words, Christianity the way it was meant to be. I can think of no better resource to get someone up to speed on what God is doing through His church TODAY. Father of Lights is a summation of everything that was in the previous two films, but with the addition of seeing God literally do the impossible, in real time while you watch. I give it the absolute highest recommendation, as with all of Darren Wilson's other films. (P.S. - this isn't just for Charismatics! The whole body of Christ needs to see these!)",1378684800,,778,4.4475524475524475

This documentary has not manipulated ""God"" to any specific denomination or movements it simply allows space to see God work and move through ordinary peoples lives.",1377993600,,277,5.465116279069767
5341072,5,B009ISQ3DI,Darren Wilson shows how Jesus's love masters the dark side of evil.the Holy Spirit is at work in the poorest parts of the world. Chicago gang members are brought to their knees to The Lord. A very moving experience as well as many others.,1377907200,,238,4.431818181818182
5341073,5,B009ISQ3DI,"We can't see God the Father, but we can certainly recognize His work when we see it.  Darren Wilson and his crew set out again to just follow where God led and film what happened.  Wow!

It is worth watching this DVD just for the Dome of the Rock footage.  God opens doors and His work will not be stopped.

I received a free copy of this DVD from Chosen Books along with Darren's book ""Finding God in the Bible.""",1377561600,,413,4.1125

5341078,3,B009ISQ3DI,"Let me start off with saying that I didn't find this film to be bad. I just didn't find it to be that special.

I saw Wilson's Finger of God back in 2010 (on Youtube, though I ended up purchasing it) and it, frankly, floored me. I was up until 2 am watching it, even though I had a graduate school class the next morning. It got me excited and really challenged what I thought about God, spirits, healings, etc. Plus, there was something about it's rawness that made it seem more real and honest.

Now back to Father of Lights. For those who have seen Finger of God and Furious Love, this third installment doesn't really build on too much. Okay, your viewers have come this far so they must believe that healings are real. They probably believe that spirits are roaming around: some good, some negative. But a lot of Father of Lights seemed to be more of the same, theology-wise and to some extent regarding the content. Plus, it was incredibly polished, had a elaborate soundtrack, and it just seemed, I don't know...like it was trying too hard. I love Bill Johnson and company but somehow they seemed so serious that it lost part of that innocent curiosity that came from the Finger of God.

I bought it right when it came out and haven't watched it again since. I'm sure I will someday, perhaps with a new perspective, but at the moment I found it to just be okay.",1376092800,7,1368,4.399209486166008
5341079,5,B009ISQ3DI,"The movie works, and its great. I think that is the only thing that is really important in buying a movie",1375574400,,105,4.0476190476190474

5341082,5,B009ISQ3DI,"This video was like getting a big glass of ice water after being in the desert for a year! Soooooo satisfying, so encouraging, so challenging, so much confirmation of things that were already stirring in my spirit! My husband and our four kids and I have been completely captivated with all of Darrin's videos. Father of Lights is the perfect one to start with and I would highly reccomend getting the directors cut version, just so much good theology and reprogramming. After being a christian for 35years, some how I had slipped into an complacent walk with the Father. I was searching for the passion that once burned within me, but I started becoming absorbed in taking political stance, anything I could to light a fire, to give life purpose, but watching the miracles and God moving and demonstrating His love has reignighted the desire for intamacy with Him! This spoke to me on so many levels, even effecting and directing the way we parent our children!!!! Loooooove it!",1374796800,3,979,4.798816568047338
5341083,4,B009ISQ3DI,"I like Darren's movies, but if you are deciding between this and Darren's Furious Love movie, I would pick Furious Love.",1372809600,,120,4.761904761904762
5341084,5,B009ISQ3DI,"I Just loved this documentary by Darren Wilson,  He goes to the remote places of the world, to share the good news of Hope, setting the captives free, where others fear to tread. Amazing!",1372550400,,187,4.5
5341085,5,B009ISQ3DI,"Excellent movie.  This movie reveals the true side of God, which is LOVE.  We have a hard time realizing how much OUR HEAVENLY FATHER loves us because of things that have happened in our life.  I recommend everyone see this movie.",1371513600,,230,4.560975609756097
5341086,5,B009ISQ3DI,"I've see all of Darren's movies and this is by, far, my favorite! you see how God brings so many things together that it's hard for skeptics to deny. and the message of love is touching at a deep level",1371427200,,201,4.05

5341090,4,B009ISQ3DI,"The first time i started watching this film, I felt like crying. I was simply overwhelmed with emotion for the people God was reaching and became more aware of my hardheartedness preventing me from reaching and loving those around me, if anything simply out of obedience to God.

5341092,5,B009ISQ3DI,"This is the 3rd movie by Darren Wilson and each are very good, but this has to be my favorite.  It confirms that God wants to work through all of us, and motivates me to let Him!  Awesome.  Highly recommended.",1368230400,,209,4.175
5341093,5,B009ISQ3DI,"Normally I do not watch movies more than once. I've watched 5 movies 2-3 times in my lifetime and I can name each of those films. Until this movie I would have never considered watching a documentary more than once. As of right now, I've seen this movie over 20 times. I've watched it with friends, family, and co-workers. Every chance I get, I watch this movie with new people.

This movie will inspire you, challenge you, make you laugh, make you cry, and have you jumping up and down and cheering. I've been a believer for my entire life, but it wasn't until recently that I experienced and witnessed the power of God on an 11 month mission trip called The World Race. Since returning home from this trip, I've desperately tried to retell my stories from the field where I saw miracles and where I saw God moving and leading us. However, it is one thing to explain these stories and it is another thing to actually show people the power of God on video. This movie will blow your socks off! Seriously!",1367971200,,1004,4.427027027027027

5341099,4,B009ISQ3DI,"I first watch this movie in a church that had a sneak peek about it. I was a little hesitant to really let go and believe the things that were happening in the movie because I felt that these people probably made all this up and then I thought to myself ""if I believe in God and know that he is all powerful and can do anything why not believe"" So even if this movie was all staged God is great and can do these miracles in the movie. There was nothing in the movie that went against doctrine of Jesus Christ which is the main point to view.",1365292800,4,541,3.9724770642201834

5341101,3,B009ISQ3DI,"I am a christian and did not enjoy watching this film at all. Honestly it just seemed very fake and/or staged.

Miracles do happen but what was shown on this documentary (if you even want to call it that) was very suspect.

The filmmaker states on his website that he does not take time to investigate any claims because he doesn't have the resources. This doesn't even make sense in one of his stories (about the witch doctor having killed a pastor) he states that it was on the news. How hard is it to get an video clip or radio transcript?

Regardless of good intentions lying to and misleading people never helps your cause.",1365033600,8,628,4.443478260869565

5341103,5,B009ISQ3DI,This was a 100% WOW film. I loved the power of God flowing through it. I loved the Spirit-led ministers --- real people reaching out to a hurting world.  I loved that Jesus is the center of it all. It is like watching the book of Acts in modern day.  Go God!,1364169600,,258,3.9423076923076925

5341112,1,B009ISQ3DI,"A movie posing as a documentary filmed and cut from blatantly bias perspective is not generally my bag. If I hadn't been invited to watch this by a friend, the flawed combination of fact mixed with fiction aimed at an already Christian market alone would have ensured it didn't reach my eyes.

The story's told lacked depth, wild statements made by people who had no credibility or background (that viewers were made aware of) were accepted as as fact before claiming other wild 'victories' for the Christian faith which slipped into religious point scoring. Where a 'miracle' (and I use the term lightly) occurred could have easily been proved through before shots of people who had injuries and ailments before 'healing' the director decided it was better just to show the after effects (which could have been nothing) and use voice overs to describe the awful injures the people had before which was all very unconvincing.

I can only describe this film as re-indoctrination for those who are already besotted with the Christian faith.

One of my friends fell asleep during this - I wish I had been that lucky.",1361750400,11,1113,4.847368421052631

5341115,5,B009ISQ3DI,"It was really touching to see how God is still at work in the work today. He is still doing miracles, healing and setting people free all around the globe.

5341116,4,B009ISQ3DI,"The movie picture and sound quality is really good.
The story is also pretty good. Its really cool how we see many places in this movie like the U.S., India, Middle East.

I don't know if everything in the movie is true, because I wasn't with the people in the movie, but if everything in there is true, God is doing some beautiful and amazing things. The movie shows us God's will for every one on earth. I wish what happened in this movie were expanded and happened a lot more. People would know what God truly desires and so many more people would have a purposeful/exciting/fulfilling life.

I don't think the producers of this film would make up things, also I have seen what happened in this movie happen in real life. So the signs, the encounters, the miracles, those still do happen today.

If you take anything from this review, know that you get a glimpse in to God's character through this film.",1360022400,3,906,4.4787878787878785

I intend to show it to our youth group, if possible, as it speaks so clearly of our identity in Christ - something many of our youth need to hear.  I would absolutely recommend this DVD to anyone who is seeking to know more about God and to know God better.  In fact, I already have recommended it to anyone who would listen to me!  I cannot rate this documentary highly enough.",1360022400,,486,4.127659574468085

So, needless to say, we had extreemly high expectations for this film and it met every one of them. We drove down to Bethel from Portland for our aniversary to see the first showing and wow. This film displays the nature and heart of the Father like no other. This film invites the audience to join God's story through a friendship with Him. It exposes the nature of the religious spirit and reveals the true liberty that Holy Spirit brings. Praise the Lord for films like this.",1356307200,,605,4.509090909090909

5341131,5,B009ISQ3DI,Darren Wilson has once again made me cry with joy as we see the powerful ways that God is working in bringing people to love and believe in Jesus Christ.

5341135,5,B009ISQ3DI,"The best thing about this film is that it doesn't tell you who it thinks God is or should be. The film allows God to reveal that Himself. Having watched the pre-quels to Father of Lights, Furious Love and Finger of God, this documentary is the pinnacle. It has become my favorite doc (and that says a lot since I have watched and loved hundreds). Father of Lights is a powerful film in a very gentle way. It's like a crescendo, building and moving into a resounding climax, all the while opening your eyes and moving your heart to new knowledge of who God is.

If you haven't watched it, give it a go- you'll be glad you did! And for those of you who have watched it and want to buy it/wish to see more of the movie, I would recommend checking out the deluxe edition. It has 11 to 13 hours of footage that never made it into the film (but is completely mind blowing!).

5341144,4,B009ISQ3DI,"Father of Lights is quite a nice DVD. It tells of how different believers listen to God's voice and how they tell others of the Lord.
I was quite taken with the first man they showed on the DVD who became a Christian and says he hears God's voice every morning telling him where to go and what to do. This man talks to witch doctors, hindu holy men, gang members etc.. I really believe he has the spirit of the Lord.
  Also we meet another man who loves the Lord and heals people with laying his hands on people and praying. This part of the movie for me wasn't all that believable, because you never see how bad the person was before he was healed. You just see the person walking and talking after healing. I guess I like to see the person before and after.
  This group of believers want you to only love others and show them love, not tell them about their sin. I know we do need to show love more and be more compassionate, but we also need to warn them of their sin and help them see themselves.
  I recommend watching this DVD, but watch with a discerning spirit.

5341145,5,B009ISQ3DI,"My Review:
 This is the first time I had the chance to watch a film by Wanderlust Productions. My family and I sat down to view it and it immediately drew us in. We LOVE watching films like this. Darren Wilson and his team have traveled the world to find out who God truly is. I know to me as a child I thought God was a tall, very old man with long, flowing white hair and a long, white beard carrying a staff. But as I have grown in my spiritual walk as well as growing more mature I have a more personal relationship with Him.
 My Father is my friend, my secret keeper. The One I can depend on always when things are going well or when things aren't. He is ever faithful and always near. The Wanderlust team has done a great job on showing us that a stronger, more intimate relationship with God is possible. He is always wanting us close to Him. We are to revere and respect Him but above all I think He wants us to love Him. He is our Daddy after all and isn't that what all Dad's want us to do?
 I like alot of the stories I heard on the film but the main one that I liked was the one about Ravi. What an amazing man of God this man is. I would love to meet him in person one day. He really has made a big impact on my family. This man is an excellent follower of Christ. We should all strive to go about God's work just as he has done.
 You know God just wants to love us. We serve a mighty God that comes to us no matter what the situation only to love us and draw us closer to Him.

Father of Lights is about a documentary about a man who set out to film God in action. By accompanied missionaries to visit a witch doctor, to visit a popular nightclub, and more, Darren Wilson was able to capture God's love for humanity.

Who it is for:

Any Christians.

Quality of the movie:

This is a professionally done film.

What I liked:

My favorite quote from the movie was ""These were his kids too, they just didn't know it yet."" (talking about some of the young people at the club that they visited)

I really liked how this movie focused on God's love.

What I didn't like:

I didn't necessarily agree with, or believe, everything that went on/was said.

My Conclusion:

This was a pretty good movie, full of God's love.

I give Father of Lights 4 out of 5 stars.

I received this dvd free to review from Fly By Promotions. The opinions expressed in this review are my true thoughts and feeling regarding this dvd. I am disclosing this information in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255.",1351641600,,1058,4.618279569892473
5341147,4,B009ISQ3DI,"Father of Lights - I have seen it twice... and I will see it again.  AND, I will recommend it to my friends!

God is not simply awaiting our arrival in heaven; He seeks after us NOW.  The movie, Father of Lights, explores how God cares about people, revealing His Love for US through those who Love Him, and through those who Love His People.

The film also show how Love defeats darkness and how Love can do the impossible... even in the midst of what may be considered completely impossible - a Christian prayer in the heart of Islam.

THIS is a must see film if you want to KNOW more about WHO God really is.

If You DON'T want to know God, see it anyway - and you will change your mind.",1351382400,,690,4.111940298507463
5341148,5,B009ISQ3DI,"About Father of Lights
FATHER OF LIGHTS chronicles the journey of filmmaker Darren Wilson and his team as they fearlessly travel the globe, far from the daily existence of the typical evangelical believer in the West. By thoughtfully documenting the stories of extraordinary believers and candidly filming miracles, visions and other supernatural occurrences, Wilson engages viewers in modern day examples of the true nature and character of God.
Wilson gives honest access to his own spiritual questions as he tackles the religious misconceptions he has struggled with throughout his life.  ""I went into making this film by asking the simple question: who is God? I wanted to know His character, His personality, and who He truly is. To answer this question, we had to peel back the many layers of religious garbage that has been passed onto him through generations. That He is angry. Vengeful. Wrathful. And in general, that He doesn't like you very much. The truth, as you will see vibrantly in this film, is that He is the most loving, compassionate, and wonderful Father you can imagine.""

My Review
This is such an powerful documentary of just how wondrous the love of God is to those that we encounter in our day to day lives. While this video shows some of the extreme conversions of God's power in their lives, from a witch doctor, a notorious Chicago gang leader, a Hindu holy man who has been searching all his life for the one true God, and even a random encounter with people in the land of Israel shows what is impossible for man to achieve, for God it's possible!

My husband and I were powerfully impacted in unexpected ways and I have to say my favorite person was an ex-drug addict, now turned street evangelist for God, Todd White. You can just see the love he has for the people he encounters and shows us all that the Bible is alive and real. That they are not just stories but real power that even now we can show to every single person around us and let the light of our Father shine in all of us. Without light, there is only darkness. I received this DVD, Father of Lights compliments of Flyby Promotions and Wanderlust Productions for my honest review and proudly give it a 5 out of 5 shining stars! You can not watch this movie without being impacted for a greater good to share the love and light of God to every single person you meet. This would make for a powerful movie to share in a Bible Study or church group! This DVD runs about 98 minutes and contains some subject matter that might not be suitable for young children.",1350950400,11,3262,4.802139037433155
