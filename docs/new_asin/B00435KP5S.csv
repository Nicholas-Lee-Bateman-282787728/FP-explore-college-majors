8414143,5,B00435KP5S,"Maria Betancourt of El Paisano writes in her review: '""Authorities began to stop teenagers on the street who had long hair, take them to the police stations and cut their hair because it was a symbol of rock. Furthermore police also stopped garage rock bands, which is were bands began.

""As a result of the government's interference with Rock n' Roll, 16,000 teenagers protested not knowing of what was to come. Some days before the Olympics in Tlatelolco, Mexico, the Mexican army killed about 300 of the protesters... Even though this horrible incident occurred, people decided to gather about three hours away from Mexico City in Avandaro, where there was a festival to save Rock 'n' Roll music.

""300,000 people went to support the bands. Everything was going well until one singer said, 'tenemos el poder!"" which means, ""we have the power!"" in Spanish. This frightened the government, and thus led them to cut all the power that was being supplied for the concert and forced the radio stations to stop broadcasting the event. Even with all the adversity the concert continued, the bands love for Rock n' Roll and their fans enabled them to play until the morning of the next day...""

Just a little thought to any musicians and fans today who get a little too self-congratulatory about their trials and tribulations.

And all should see this film and reconnect with what art, at its core, is really about. Not trying to be rich, or even known, but an expression of life. Worth putting life on the line for.",1337990400,2,1511,4.777777777777778
8414144,5,B00435KP5S,"Be sure to get the version of this that includes both the DVD and the CD in the package.  The CD has the songs in full that you only hear parts of on the DVD.  It's worth buying just for that!  My buddies in Portland who are into rock history were completely wowed by some of the early ones in particular, like ""Marihuana Boogie"" (early 1950's I'm guessing) and ""La Borrachita"" (1960 or '61 - pure genius!).  A couple of the slow ones are less to my personal taste, but Javier Batiz's seductive version of ""Si Estuvieras Aqui"" made my mom cry.",1337904000,,543,4.294117647058823
8414145,5,B00435KP5S,"The story of rock as it developed in Mexico is interesting in itself.  But this film also acquaints the viewer with some remarkable individuals: legendary rock stars in every sense of the phrase, as unique and charismatic as any in the US.  Johnny Ortega, Javier Batiz, Alex Lora, and others -- colorful and controversial, every Mexican over 40 knows who they are.  The film's producer Fito de la Parra is himself as interesting as any.  Their music is a permanent part of the culture.  They have each sold tens of millions of albums.  Their first-hand recollections of how things were in the '50's, '60's and '70's are vivid and fascinating, from the blues bars of Tijuana to the underground venues during Mexico's version of (musical) prohibition.  The interviews with these pivotal figures, slipped liberally in-between historical clips, make the film much more than simply a documentary of cultural history.  I loved it!",1302998400,,924,5.032894736842105
8414146,5,B00435KP5S,"This is the story of the early days of rock & roll in Mexico as told by guys that were there and living it.
If you are into fairly recent music history, this is a must see!
I learned a lot from it, I'm sure you probably will too. Five stars all the way....",1302480000,,256,3.759259259259259
8414147,5,B00435KP5S,"Produced by Lance Miccio, Joel Schechter and Fito de la Parra, and directed by Miccio, ""Rock 'n' Roll Made in Mexico"" ([...]) presents an outline of the history of rock music in Mexico. Through interviews of players and journalists we learn, for the first time, a rock history much more violent than that of the United States'.

In The Beginning: One interviewee states that rock in Mexico was initially inspired by American movies--especially 1955's ""The Blackboard Jungle"" featuring the song ""Rock Around the Clock"" by Bill Haley and the Comets. Initially it was adult jazz and swing bands discovering more money by stepping down to the easier-to-play music. In 1958, young teenagers, starting in garage bands, began playing for young people. The center of this emergence was, not surprisingly, Mexico City, where they played tunes from American Top 40 radio. Tijuana became the center for the Black-influenced rhythm and blues.

As the music blossomed, so did governmental repression. Those who fought this repression staged a demonstration near the site of the 1968 Summer Olympics, the day before the opening. Sixteen thousand students showed up. Hundreds or more were murdered by authorities. But the movement was undaunted, climaxing in 1971, at the Avandaro festival--""The Mexican Woodstock."" The government took advantage of this large-scale event to institutionalize its repression. Rock music was made illegal and remained so for 14 years.

Having been in the center of this history, co-writer/co-producer de la Parra is also one of the interviewees. After this project was completed in 2007, he went on to produce 2009's ""Living the Blues: The Story of Canned Heat"" with Miccio again directing. de la Parra has been Canned Heat's drummer since 1967.",1302134400,3,1761,5.259786476868327
