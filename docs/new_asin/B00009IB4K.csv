7990806,1,B00009IB4K,It's pretty bad. Many better films in the SB series. Weak action in particular.,1486166400,,79,4.714285714285714

7990810,3,B00009IB4K,"This movie I only watch the beginning of it (1st 3 minutes because its f ing tight) , then pass forward to the part where Lu tai yeh (white haired kung fu master) fight this kung fu master in the deep mountain slopes, before the fight (not Lu tai yeh) the other kung fu master eats some pistachios & he spits out a big bunch of saliva - is that how you prepare for a duel of your life?  - the describe part I remember seeing it back in the days when it was on TV & the show was called Kung Fu Theater - they aired it every weekend & sometimes Saturday nights.
Skip forward to the scene where Lu tai yeh fights the  3 uncles & those are the parts to watch
The rest of the movie don't watch unless you have time to kill.  Don't recommend the end fight its nothing special.
Read my other review for the same version of this movie on my opinion at the end of the review about it then you will know.

For this dvd version & the other version  - after 30 mins of research on the internet here's the differences:
The other version is 88 mins long & 4:3 (what ?? so its missing parts or something ???)
while this one is 90 mins - 1:33:1
so which one is uncut & with my samsung UN46f7500 smart tv - when I watch it in 16x9 on my TV & dvd setup 1080p 16x9 hopefully the picture will not be cut off with black bars on top & bottom or sides.

I should make the dvd myself the way I want it then no problems.

5 stars for kung fu fighting &  minus 2 star for the sorry ending with lousy story that is boring.

and the part where the spits out saliva - it might be cut out on one of the dvd's.",1387411200,,1579,3.8487654320987654
7990811,5,B00009IB4K,"For this movie I only like the opening scene in the beginning of the movie & a few fights from the start of the movie.  After that I jump to the part where the white haired guy fights the 3 uncles and the one stick fighter master when he was at some hill on the mountains and lu tai yeh (white haired guy) comes to challenge him & he eats some cough drops then he spits out a blob of saliva then they fight- Is that how someone prepares to fight?
The ending fight is retarded - P.O.S.  - Yuen woo ping or the director from Butterfly Swords starring Michelle Yeoh,or from Fong Sai Yuk - jet li ,  or from New Legend of Shaolin -Jet li: one of those director(s) should have been there to direct the last fight then it will be way better.
The picture quality - the opening credits portion needs to be even more restored digitally. After the opening credits - the rest of the movie the picture quality is very good. The story is lousy.
Bruce Lee's Way of Kung Fu aka Dragon's Inferno starring Dragon Lee combined it with Shaolin Invincible Sticks into one movie will be a better story with better fighting skills and comedy.",1307404800,,1120,4.248826291079812
7990812,3,B00009IB4K,"After seeing the hype right here on amazon,,I rushed out to get this flick,,,,,it o.k,,,3 stars at best!!  However, grossly over rated in my opinion.  Of all the weapons you see in old school kung movies,,,there 's nothing special about stick fighting kung fu!! There 's no question the story is good,,the fight scenes good,,,however, you see one stick fights, and you see them all.  Honestly,,after the first stick fight, there were no more suprizes in the flick, it got really boaring and predictable,,it only seemed and feel like the same scenes over and over repeating itself!!",1149897600,3,581,4.969072164948454
7990813,4,B00009IB4K,"Hey, another movie with one of those white-haired villans that must be ""ELIMINATED.""  How did I guess that? Loved this flick also.  Fighting scenes ""tough"" - stick matches ""rough"" - I can't complain at all. Overdubs - not bad.  I can live with some bad overdubs if the flick is ""tight.""

Watch closely as this white-haired villan goes from school to school challenging and destroying anyone who knows stick fighting.  This guy is really good with his stick/pole and it's very difficult for others to beat him.  What is kind of bizzare about this one is that anyone who knows stick fighting is his enemy.  I like this flick so much that I transferred it to my PDA and watch it sometimes at work.  Some of the stick fighting scenes will have you seriously cracking up.  You will surely play a few of these scenes over and over again!

By all means please see my other reviews so you won't get stuck with worthless Kung Fu [...] that's not worth the disc it was copied to.  The plot keeps you awake throughout!  Definetly in my top 5%.  You won't go wrong with this one at all.",1124928000,19,1074,4.418367346938775

7990815,5,B00009IB4K,"This is the film that sets standards for other films.
Wong Tao and Chang Yi are sesational!
The DVD is hosted by Gordon Liu Chia Hui,who gives a great interview and multiple demonstrations of his martial arts.
Menus are also hosted by Gordon(some are quite funny).
A great package!",1063411200,4,281,4.755102040816326
