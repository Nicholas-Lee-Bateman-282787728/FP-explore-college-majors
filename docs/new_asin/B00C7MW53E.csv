5696162,5,B00C7MW53E,These are 2 great titles for a more than reasonable price. I tried (unsuccessfully) to get them from Netflix but got tired of waiting so I decided to check out just buying them. I'm glad I did!,1375315200,,193,4.243243243243243

5696164,5,B00C7MW53E,"If you haven't scene Scent of a Woman you r really missing out.  It's not a chick flick, it's not an action movie.  It's a type of movie that when u get it your not sure exactly what to expect.  Kindof like The Notebook in that aspect but a whole different type of movie other than not knowing what to expect.  I LOVE IT!",1471392000,,321,3.96875

5696178,5,B00C7MW53E,"Sea of Love is a great movie! Great plot line, interesting character development. John Goodman, Al Pacino, and Ellen Barkin make this a movie not to be missed. Movie with lots of twists and turns, great characters, good editing. Well worth your time.

This is an Adult-themed movie, with many scenes to which children / teenagers should not be exposed.",1431648000,,352,4.866666666666666

5696185,5,B00C7MW53E,"SCENT OF A WOMAN and SEA OF LOVE were both very good Al Pacino films. They are totally different films from each other and Pacino gives very good performances in each. Well, Al Pacino's performance in SCENT OF A WOMAN may be his best. To the point, each of these films have terrific finales and that may be why these two were chosen to pair.",1414627200,2,341,4.2615384615384615
5696186,5,B00C7MW53E,GREAT movie...a must see,1414022400,,24,5.25
5696187,5,B00C7MW53E,Good double feature,1410480000,,19,5.666666666666667
5696188,5,B00C7MW53E,Does it get any better than TWO Al Pacino movies on one dvd? :)  Both are awesome movies - Scent of a Woman is fun and sad and everything in between.  Sea of Love is a thriller without all the gore and blood but keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Warning - very steamy sex scenes between Ellen Barkin and Al Pacino in this one but oth well worth watching.,1406073600,,357,3.9305555555555554
5696189,5,B00C7MW53E,Scent of a Woman is one of my favorite movies but my husband hadn't seen it. he ended up liking it too. Sea of Love was just a bonus for us,1402358400,,139,3.5161290322580645

5696191,5,B00C7MW53E,"These are both great movies. Price was very reasonable. With all this snow on the East coast lately a warm blanket, cocoa and movies are the way to go.",1392076800,3,151,4.241379310344827
5696192,5,B00C7MW53E,outside of his blockbusters these are 2 of his best shows you how he can do any role he takes on,1390089600,,96,3.619047619047619
5696193,4,B00C7MW53E,These are two of my wife's movies and to have them taking only one space is a plus.  Space savers like this is the way to go if you have a larger collection.,1380758400,,157,3.757575757575758

8578200,5,B00C7MW53E,"Such a beautiful movie set, and it's easily in my top ten. I'm reviewing more of Scent of a Woman than sea of Love at least until I watch that. Al Pacino puts on a performance of a lifetime and made a two and a half hour movie fly by. The famous tango scene is utterly remarkable and it has to be one of my favorite scenes ever as well. This movie left me in awe and I had to just take a few minutes after watching it to really come down from such an amazing experience.",1500508800,,470,3.8556701030927836
