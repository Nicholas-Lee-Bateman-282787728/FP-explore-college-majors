8430111,5,B004I5OCJ8,Excellent historical drama production and Poh Kim edition with excellent Mandarin audio which brings all characters live!  All characters play their roles very well. Costume designers have great color sense. There were a couple of freezes for a couple of seconds and the Chinese subtitle was missing for about a min in all 8 DVDs together .,1527465600,,340,4.964912280701754

8430115,4,B004I5OCJ8,"The Kingdom of the wind played by Jumong is so sad and even more deverstating than the movie of original Jumong, Prince of the Legend.
It is tos sad that Jumong die so young.  In the movie the Kingdom of the wind did not show how Jumong die. I would love to  watch more drama played by Jumong I mean Song II gook.  He is an amazing, brave, intelligent, strong, very skill full in archery skills.  Can never have enough watching the Movie.

Thank you for making this movie.",1451260800,,472,4.258426966292135
