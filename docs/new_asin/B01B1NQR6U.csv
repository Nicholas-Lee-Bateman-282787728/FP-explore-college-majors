The UK bluray looks great and has a bunch of extras. USA fans finally get a bluray release in August 2018! As Granny Klump would say, go on buy this one. You know you want it! I hope one day we get a Nutty Professor 3 with the whole gang back! I think it would be a hit!

The UK bluray is region B locked, so you will need a region Free player to watch. Hopefully the USA bluray gets all the extras ported over. I doubt we'll get the Extended Unrated version though. The UK version doesn't have the extended cut either. Just the theatrical cut.",1531008000,,691,4.156716417910448
