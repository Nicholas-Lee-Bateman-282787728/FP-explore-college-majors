8527077,2,B008DWG0TW,"This blu-ray dvd started off well enough.  Great picture, the sound is quite good, nothing to write home about, but quite alright.  The first several offerings are unknown to me, all the better, and I assume one would call them ""classical"" music.  Maybe ""classical LITE""???  Then they get away from that and play other music.  I really don't know much about classical cello music, but I love what I hear most of the time--Mischa Maisky, Yo-Yo Ma, and the new girl, Alisa Weilerstein--awesome!!!!  This did not hit that funny bone.  I really love rock cello, the woman playing cello with David Gilmour in Concert is awesome!!!!  This music does not go there.  And then the soprano came out and it was pretty much downhill from there for me.  Sorry, just not my kind of music AT ALL.  Perhaps it will be just exactly your cup of tea.  It is not mine.
""As time goes by"" and ""Yesterday"" are wonderful songs, as are others on this disc, but there is just not enough gristle in these covers--I had to work hard to hear it as a bit more than elevator music.  Sorry.",1376611200,,1058,4.476439790575916

8527080,5,B008DWG0TW,"This disc celebrates the 40th anniversary of `The 12 Cellists', the internationally renowned cello section of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.  This chamber ensemble has a reputation of such magnitude that it almost, some would say certainly, eclipses that of the whole orchestra.

The ensemble was created almost by chance as an offshoot to a birthday party celebration. From this very informal beginning it rapidly grew in size and a repertoire had to be created. Initially this took the form of especially composed pieces but increasingly there has been an emphasis on arrangements of music from non-classical genres that is generally admired. These arrangements explore all the enormous possibilities of a group of cellists who appear to have limitless technical resources at their disposal as well as the almost equally limitless possibilities of cello sound. As such this extends far beyond the normal scope of cross-over music.

The concert itself was held in Berlin at the Philharmonie and included guest artists Annette Dasch, soprano, and jazz trumpeter Till Bronner.  The opening item, not surprisingly, is Hymnus by Julius Klengel which featured so prominently in early programmes including the very first and this is followed by another original composition by Jean Francaix, his Aubade.

From then onwards all the remaining pieces are arrangements and all exhibit a high degree of musical and entertainment value. Faure's Pavane, beautifully played, is followed by somewhat lighter, but not lesser, fare from Vincent Scotto, Michel Legrand and Herman Hupfeld. Annette Dasch then makes her first appearance with three French songs by Debussy and Ravel before returning a little later for Edith Piaf's `La vie en rose'. These are all delectably sung in a winningly modest manner. She is well matched in these ways by Till Bronner who plays Thelonious Monk's `Round Midnight' with a suitably sultry and laid-back performance on flugel horn.

In between we are treated to a favourite item by Ennio Morricone, the atmospheric `Man with the Harmonica' from Once upon a Time in the West, an intriguing `Caravan' arrangement (Ellington), the Mysterious Fugue by Astor Piazzolla making his second appearance and featuring the cellists gradually returning to the stage (a sort of reverse Haydn's Farewell), Kaiser-Lindemann's exciting Bossa for 12, before concluding the concert with the Beatles' perennial `Yesterday'.

The documentary is that very rare thing indeed - a documentary that will probably be enjoyed on more than one occasion. This very well-made and involving 59 minute film by Enrique Lansch charts the history of the `12' from the beginning in 1972 to the present with copious interviews and comments from founder and current members in a variety of settings. In addition we eavesdrop on rehearsals for a new composition, Labyrinth, by Sofia Gubaidulina and become deeply involved in the Asian tour focusing on Beijing and Shanghai.

What comes over so strongly in this documentary is the cohesive strength of the ensemble, their ability to harness disparate and strong personalities, their good humour in the face of an exacting work schedule and their remarkable reserves of generous energy. This is a very special group of musicians indeed.

The accompanying booklet is excellent as is the camera work which is fully involving and which delivers high quality imaging throughout the concert and documentary. The sound is clear in typical HD terms and is presented in full range surround DTS 5.1 of clarity as well as stereo. The documentary has subtitles in English, German and two Asian languages, the scripts of which are beyond my understanding.

This is a unique disc in terms of its content, both as a concert and as a documentary. Both are of a very high standard indeed and should give considerable repeat enjoyment to any purchasers attracted by the program on offer. For all the reasons described above it seems only reasonable to rate this as a clear 5 star issue.",1347667200,10,3999,5.224648985959439
