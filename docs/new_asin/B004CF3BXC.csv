It is probably best to see the first part before watching this unless you are familiar with 18th Century Thai history. The original village of Bang Rajan stood up to the invading Burmese army and were obliterated. They were inspired by a Buddhist Monk who gave them sacred cloth to wear for protection. Word of their heroic efforts spread and the monk was recruited by refugee villagers to aid them.

This is the story of what became known as `The Yantric Cloth Brothers', and how they carried on the fight even after their capital was surrounded and taken by the very brutish Burmese. The film starts with the Brotherhood rescuing some villagers in a bit of a blood bath, and how they take them back to their hideout. This is a fight fest of a film, but it also tells of the problems they faced with food and other logistics and there are the human stories of how life and love continues.

The Burmese are portrayed as caricature bad guys who kill, rape and burn at will. The Thais are not all heroes, some are collaborators and cowards and there is the occasional aside into humour but essentially this is for cut and slash fans and is also quite questionable on the historical front. They use swords, axes, arrows, firearms, cannons and sort of hand grenades which may be a stretch on the truth but makes for great cinema. It is fair to say the original was a massive box office hit taking over 300 million baht at the Thai box office (it only cost 50) so more of the same guaranteed a good take at the cinema second tine round. It was originally called `Bang Rajan 2' so as to leave one in no illusion.

The cinematography is excellent, the fight scenes spectacular and the musical score a real triumph. It seems to owe a fair bit to Michael Mann's classic `The Last of the Mohicans'. There is also some great political philosophy, like `if one stick is in the fire, it will burn up quickly - but many sticks will last longer'. It is all a basic ploy to champion the cause of unity, which s a big theme in Thailand. There is a lot of melodrama (over acting) and some ropey CGI, but the film is so intense that these misdemeanours are easily over looked.

It lasts just over two hours but it really does fly by and there are some excellent extras, including a free digital copy and a `making of'. If you like a guts and glory actioner you will not be disappointed. I am a fan of world cinema and really enjoyed this and hope it is as successful as part one.",1335571200,2,2688,4.6054279749478075
