7830029,4,6302703689,"This movie, which was originally a short-lived TV series, looks at William Tell, a man who lived in the days of the old Holy Roman Empire. His life is turned upside-down when a new law is enacted, requiring a hat belonging to the Emperor to be placed in the town square of each village... and also requiring each person to kneel before it as if it were the Emperor himself. When his son defies the order William Tell is forced to demonstrate his skill as a crossbow shot by shooting an apple off his son's head. Historically, this all leads to a revolt which ends with creation of the Swiss Confederation.

The original program was good but the effort to turn it into a movie during the VHS era is a bit sloppy in places. The post-airing electronic credits and music have ""cheap movie"" written all over them. Still, it remains a good program with sword fights, royal plots and adventure. Well worth finding!",1400976000,2,907,4.530487804878049
7830030,5,6302703689,"I loved this show when it was on, and hadn't thought of it in ages.  How sad to find out that it's not available anywhere except a few bits on VHS (really, does *anyone* still have a VHS machine?) :(",1379030400,,199,3.975
7830031,5,6302703689,"I loved this show, and wrote several letters to the network it was on (at the time, it was called The Family Channel) asking for a video release. They always replied that they were sorry it wasn't going to happen. Until jut now I was unaware of this VHS release. Too bad I haven't have a VHS player for years.
If this is ever released on disc... preferably a complete series set... I'd be all over it!
There were silly moments in it, but overall was a good show with a decent story-arc. I loved the occasional appearance by a big name. One of my favorite episode featured Robert Guillaume, whom I really admired at the time. It's always surprised me that it's not in his IMDB entry.",1299974400,2,682,4.3359375
7830032,4,6302703689,I too enjoyed the series when it was on tv. Only found the movie in a video store sale rack after the series went off the air. I bought it immediately. Now I regularly check Amazon to see if someone has wised up and decided to put all of it out on dvd. JoH,1271721600,3,256,3.759259259259259
