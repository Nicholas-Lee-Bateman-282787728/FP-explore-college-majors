2457316,4,B000CCFNOY,"The topic was well handled in a general sense.  The format was quick paced and pleasing.  Many of the issues raised were interesting takes on subjects that we intuitively know and understand, but Ms. Catrell reminds us of their significance.  While there is nothing earth shattering on the DVD, it does serve to reinforce a common sense view of sex and the different ways men and women approach the subject.",1142208000,11,407,4.785714285714286
2457317,3,B000CCFNOY,"I am a big fan of Kim Cattrall and I thought she did a great job being the host of this documentary. She educates you own sex like the history of it and showing us museum's that has picture's of greeks. She even went to England were the ground was carved shaped into a giant penius which would never be in the U.S.

What I hated about this documtary was not enough nudity and they didn't show people actually having sex all they did was talked about sex. And Kim Cattrall who played in ""Sex in the City"" she had lot's of sex on that show but in Sexual Intelligence she doesn't even get fully naked not even one time. She's only naked on the DVD cover just her way to get people to buy this what a rip off.

I wish Kim Cattrell could play in adult movies.",1141948800,17,754,4.053691275167785
2457318,2,B000CCFNOY,"While I love the cover artwork, the rest of the program isn't really all that sexy. The problem is that she's pretending to be SATC's Samantha Jones. I love SATC, but it's lame when an actor acts ""in character"" away from the show itself. In fact, it's embarrassing. Not only that, but the presentation isn't very good. Kim deserves credit for trying. Older women are very sexy. It's just a shame Kim Cattrall didn't host this instead of ""Samantha-lite"".",1138579200,16,453,4.746835443037975

8097433,5,B000CCFNOY,"This DVD, based on Kim Cattrall's book, Sexual Intelligence, portrays an excellent description of human sex powers.  This documentary encourages us to sincerely believe that we should never be ashamed of our sex energies, but rather that we should rejoice in their ability to bring us emotional, physical, and spiritual pleasure.  I highly recommend her book, as well as this DVD, to anyone who may feel ashamed of their sexuality, or struggle with their sexual identity.",1335225600,2,471,5.184210526315789
8097434,1,B000CCFNOY,"I saw this video on Netflix via my free trial on my Playstation so I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it.  I am a huge SATC fan, and I disagree that Kim was playing Samantha - she really wasn't.  If she had, there might have been some redeeming qualities to the show.  It was exceedingly boring (who cares about Aphrodite, nude statues of David etc?), it offered no new information whatsoever (regardless of your age), and the production value was amateur at best.  Bad all around.  Another reviewer said ""someone must have had it in for Kim Cattrall to put her in this thing"".  Well, she must have it in for herself as this was HER production, based on her book by the same name.  I do not believe it was an HBO product either - at the end it had a Discovery logo.",1293580800,6,767,4.212328767123288
8097435,2,B000CCFNOY,"Like my title says, someone must have had it in for Kim Cattrall to put her in this thing.  Ms. Cattrall is always worth watching, but she shares the stage with a lot of other people who are not.  After she steps off the screen the disk is a great cure for insomnia, but I can sleep well without it, thank you.  The surprising thing is, it is produced by HBO, which is otherwise noted for the exceptional quality of their productions.  This is a disk you will want if you are a Kim Cattrall collector.  Otherwise, keep your money in your pants.",1153785600,8,544,4.242718446601942
