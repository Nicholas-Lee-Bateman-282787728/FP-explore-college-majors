1245825,2,B00001ODHD,"... Video and audio quality are on par with VHS -- even the bonus trailer of ""The Night Visitor"" looks like a third-generation bootleg copy. Had I bought this at a gas station, I would have expected this kind of quality, but a serious DVD release tagetted at Bava fans should have more effort put into it. A total waste of the DVD format. Can't wait for someone else to release it so I can sell it. If you love Bava's work, you won't be disappointed by the movie, but I recommend you buy it used ...",1058918400,2,499,4.154639175257732
1245826,5,B00001ODHD,"Kill Baby Kill is a surprisingly good, beautifully presented, deliciously atmospheric horror film from noted Italian director Mario Bava.  This is actually a fairly creepy ghost story, but there is a pretty significant death count nonetheless.  The very first scene shows us a distraught young lady throwing herself, quite reluctantly, onto a spiked rail fence.  Finding himself stymied in his investigation of the victim's death by a superstitious town population, Inspector Kruger calls in a coroner to perform an autopsy on the victim.  Dr. Eswe finds himself having to walk a short distance into the small village because his driver refuses to enter it.  He arrives to find a pretty desolate place with deserted streets, highly suspicious townspeople, and a mysterious but undeniable sense of gloom and doom.  A young lady named Monica (Erica Blanc) soon arrives to witness the coroner's autopsy, one in which a coin is found nailed into the heart of the victim.  Monica is one of the few people to have ever left the village, being taken away at just two years of age, but her connection with the townsfolk is predictably much deeper than even she knows.  The townspeople won't talk about the suicide because ""the child"" will kill them if they do; based on later evidence, this is sound thinking on their part.  The evil force seemingly responsible for what becomes a string of deaths is the ghost of a little seven-year old girl who died twenty years earlier while the townspeople failed to notice or just refused to respond to her cries for help.  Little Melissa does much to make this movie compelling, as the child actress is genuinely frightening with her large eyes, forceful glances, and innocent yet malevolent laughter.  The doctor doesn't believe in the superstitious story of the ghost, but as he becomes more and more involved in the investigation, his ideas are forced to evolve somewhat.

The village setting is magnificently done, with ancient, moldering buildings, a seemingly perpetual darkness, vintage costumes, and an overall sense of grim tidings.  At times, the movie seems to take on the appearance of a surreal work of art.  Some innovative camera work lends great depth to the presentation, although the director does seem to get slightly carried away once or twice.  Erica Blanc's presence helps make up for some minor weaknesses in the performance of Giacomo Rossi-Stuart as Dr. Eswe, although I think my problem with his performance, at least early on, was the fact that his fancy ways and looks just seemed incredibly out of place in a horror movie such as this.  It took me a little while to fully get into the story, but by the mid-point of the film I was definitely hooked.  It is not wholly original, and one of the major plot points can be easily foreseen very early on, yet I enjoyed this movie tremendously.  You won't find a lot of gore here, nor even an excessive amount of suspense, but the atmosphere just overwhelms you as you progress, giving Kill Baby Kill an ambiance and character that most horror films can never hope to achieve.  Music, direction, and standout individual performances combine to make this an engaging, creepy psychological masterpiece.  The title makes this movie sound like some kind of B-movie, but in reality it is an impressive, polished, consummately professional work of horrific art.",1048291200,15,3359,4.953654188948307
1245827,3,B00001ODHD,"Once again, I have to rate the DVD by its' quality.  This entertainment medium is ALL ABOUT great picture and fantastic sound.  Although I appreciate the opportunity to see the Mario Bava movie, the DVD is not something that will excite your senses alone.
The DVD runs smoothly so at least it has that going for it.  One can assume that this is all there is left to publish for this particular movie, even though it came years later than Bava's first features.
You will be treated to a couple beautiful women as a feast for the eyes.  One is dressed up and one is dressed down.  There is an older, spooky woman and of course the female child is unsettling to look at.  The spooky village is dirty and old, and it has a wonderful cemetary set.
Gee, I wish that I could have seen this movie when I was younger!  It's a film that I'll play often.",1012262400,,843,4.264150943396227
1245828,4,B00001ODHD,"This is a very classical horror film, which is little bit old, but some scenes are nice and well made. From the beginning until end, there is only night scene no daylight. This film is using a color as an atmosphere; for instance, green is used appropriately in a horror mood.
There are some technical scenes, which are actually not specific nowadays, but at that time, maybe it would be uncommon. For example, main actor just run to the same room and he try to go to the downstairs but he wanders from same floor. The plot is that people are killed from conspiracy between a woman who tries to control the spirit of human, and a mother who tries to save her daughter's spirit who was killed. Anyway, it is a fine work of Mario Bava, especially classical mood was really splendid.",1003104000,,780,4.461538461538462
1245829,4,B00001ODHD,"VCI's early DVD release of Bava's ""Kill Baby Kill"" is nowhere near as clean a presentation as their other Bava releases, but it is not as bad as the rumors have made it out to be.  Yes, there is some slight artifacting, the colors are somewhat washed out and it's in full-frame instead of widescreen, but overall, it's still very watchable and superior than any of the VHS releases of the title.  Apparently, there are no better master sources for the film that still exist so the rumored upcoming release by Image would probably be of the same quality (I would love to be proved wrong, tho).  The lack of widescreen is a bit unnerving and noticeable in a few shots where characters are off to the side and not visible on screen when they should be, but it's not a scope film so it's not too bad.  Anyway, the film is presented decently and, even with the DVD's flaws, it's better than VHS and Bava fans shouldn't avoid snatching this film up.  And if you buy the Mario Bava box-set, you basically would get this one ""free"" because of the discounted price - so what are you waiting for?",983577600,5,1086,4.41
1245830,4,B00001ODHD,"Another little gem from italian director Mario Bava has just entered the DVD market : the 1966 OPERAZIONE PAURA aka KILL, BABY...KILL ! After the releases of RABID DOGS (great), BAY OF BLOOD and BARON BLOOD, the Bava fan  was already smiling, now he is literally hysterical. And more releases are  announced for the next weeks to come. Miam ! Miam !
KILL, BABY...KILL !  plays in the same category than THE MASK OF SATAN or BARON BLOOD : the  Gothic, yes, but in the Bava manner. So we witness a few gothic murders  shot in a blue-green-yellow fog in the middle of a lost austrian village.  Nothing very special after all BUT then comes the detail that kills :  someone has put a penny in the heart of the murdered people (Bava, you're  the greatest !).
There is also a scene which deserves to stay in Movie  History (yes, Sir !) : the hero, played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart, is trying  to find Erika Blanc (the heroin, the blonde with the white transparent  pyjama and almost nothing (gargl..) under it) through the numerous rooms of  the Villa Graps, he runs and runs and finally catches his own double.  Simple but magistral idea.

1245845,5,B00001ODHD,"Okay, it's a stupid title for a movie, and it sounds like it belongs to a cheap slasher flick.

But fortunately Mario Bava's ""Kill Baby Kill"" is much better than its hokey title suggests, as one would expect from a giallo master. Instead of a slasher movie, it's a gothic horror movie with impalements, ghosts and magic. It has all the beauty -- and terror -- of a decayed fairy tale.

When a young woman leaps onto an iron fence, young Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) is called in to do an autopsy, with the help of beautiful Monica (Erica Blanc). He finds a coin in the girl's heart, and none of the townspeople will tell him -- because if they do, they will suffer a similar fate. Eswai doesn't buy all this superstition.

He's even more annoyed when local sorceress Ruth (Fabienne Dali) begins using her powers to protect a young girl from a childlike specter -- little dead aristocrat Melissa Graps. But as the bodies pile up, and Monica is plagued by bizarre nightmares, Eswai must accept Ruth's help to save Monica from the ghost, and an evil baroness.

""Kill Baby Kill"" is more gothic horror rather than straightforward ""giallo.""  But it has the cinematic touches that Bava was known for. Bava fills the run-down village sets with broken doors, wrought-iron fences, coffins, and long fluttering canopies. It's gothically delicious.

Bava also adds dreamlike touches to his typical style-- the village is full of mist, tombstones, and green, blue and red lighting that flicks on and off. He packs this movie so full of visual opulance, it's like being locked inside a beautiful nightmare -- and it adds to the feeling of a fairy tale gone horribly wrong.

And he has a knack for the really spooky stuff too. A bouncing ball, childish giggling, and a little girl on a swing become really horrifying, not to mention all those impalements on everything from fences to, uh, candlesticks. Two particularly eerie scenes have Eswai chasing himself through endless rooms, and Monica running down an endless spiral stair.

The ghost story itself is quite simple, and the secret identities of two characters are quite obvious. But fortunately, this doesn't detract from the atmosphere. How could it? ""Kill Baby Kill"" is steeped in atmosphere from the first creepy scene, and rather than building in suspense, it runs steadily all the way to the end.

And the cast helps. Despite the emotionless dubbing, Rossi-Stuart and Blanc both do outstanding jobs, but the best performance of the movie belongs to Fabienne Dali, as a tragic sorceress who is trying to save the village from Melissa's revenge. The scene where she mourns her dead lover is exquisite.

""Kill Baby Kill"" is a gorgeous, creepy ghost story, with good acting and stellar direction. Definitely a must-see for fans of atmospheric cult horror.",1167782400,12,2802,4.867647058823529
1245846,3,B00001ODHD,"The worst thing about this film is the title...""Kill Baby Kill"" is far more suitable for a schlocky blood 'n' breasts romp than this stately gothic. Everything else about the film is pretty good. The story tells of a doctor who arrives in a remote village to investigate some mysterious murders. The coach driver who delivers him will come no nearer than the village outer walls, and the villagers inside either give him the silent stare treatment or tell him to leave if he knows what's good for him. The only person to befriend him is an attractive young female scientist, who assists him in his investigation despite fearing for her own safety...because the village is being haunted by the apparition of a young blonde girl, who's appearance is said to mark the person who sees her for a violent death.

Now, after being faced with that many horror movie cliches in the opening 20 minutes, you might be forgiven for losing interest with this pretty quickly. And it's true to say that few movies starting with this premise ever approach the realms of the ""classics"". But stick with this one and you might see some scenes that surprise you.

Firstly, the thing that every reviewer seems to mention is the colour. Scenes are bathed in all sorts of unnatural shades of blues, reds and yellows, and the effect makes the film take on a very luxurious appearance. The photography is mostly very beautiful. Shots of the ghostly girl peering through windows, along with the general eye for compostion in most shots is very accomplished. The location the film is set in is also pretty striking, seemingly filmed in an almost totally derelict village. I don't know how the viewer is supposed to believe that people actually carry on their lives dwelling in what appear to be roofless ruins!

The atmosphere is postitively dripping with gothic trappings. Every scene takes place in either a ruin of some sort, a heavily decorated room or a cobwebbed passage or tomb. The characters all wear richly detailed period clothes. The best scenes of the movie take place in a grand, isolated villa - the source of the villager's terror and the home of the murderous phantom child who seems to be terrorizing the place. The only living inhabitant is the child's mother, a reclusive and half-mad Baroness, played up to the hilt by the actress in a full-on ""Miss Haversham"" style. She hates the villagers and holds them responsible for the death of her young daughter many years ago. Will she help or hinder our heroes as they try to end the ghostly reign of terror?

There's no denying the fact that although it's strikingly filmed, the movie still looks a bit cheap and formulaic. But Bava was always adept at making a lot out of a little, and he succeeds here. There's a great dream sequence that the heroine experiences at one point, plus another scene in which the hero runs through a maze of identical rooms in the Baroness's villa, running so fast he actually catches up with HIMSELF at one point - a very bizarre sequence! The ending is also quietly satisfying, if maybe a little muted.

You won't find any gore or nudity in this horror tale, but you will find plenty of flair for period gothic. The sombre ghostly girl and her bouncing ball (it often appears, plopping down a staircase or corridor, even though she is nowhere in sight) are great horror movie motifs. Sadly, the English dubbing is rather lame as usual, and the DVD's available of this film in English are reportedly not the greatest image quality. it would be nice to see this in widescreen and re-mastered, and apparently there is an Australian DVD release that has managed this...let's hope some copies of that make their way around the world.",1155513600,,3700,4.7213622291021675

1245848,4,B00001ODHD,Quality Italian gothic horror. This kind of vibe cannot be achieved these days. Classic thriller short of epic proportions but definately cult material.,1140480000,5,152,5.6521739130434785
1245849,5,B00001ODHD,"Ok so there's no nudity or gore, but this film has quite a few scenes that will send some chills up your spine. The little girl that plays the ghost of Mellisa is evil, scary, and a diabolical little killer. Check her out in the scene where she wills the innkeeper's daughter to stab herself through the throat. I mean really look at her! That smile is pure evil and the way she keeps darting her eyes is sinister. When she pops out of closets or in hallways she always has that evil twisted little look and she raised the level of how the film turned out. Kudos to the director for getting that girl to do that.

Of course there are some hot chicks in this movie as well. The innkeeper's daughter is a real cutie. Monica plays Melissa's older sister and she is stunning. Check out the scene when she wakes up from her nightmare. She gives us a heartbreaking view of her thighs. That demented doll sitting on the edge of the bed was another fright thrown in for good measure. ANd how can we forget the lovely raven haired sorceress? She's a hottie.

Our hero is the good doctor who came to the village to investigate an apparant suicide, but the townsfolk know it's really the curse of Melissa. Check out this dudes hair. In the entire movie never a hair is out of place. It's like his whole head was dipped in clear plastic. I mean sure he never changes his clothes either, but my God that hair. How could he investigate a murder with all the time he would need to spend in front of the mirror? I guess that's why the Burgermeister was bald, we had enough hair to deal with.

Anyway, this movie is great. Sure they go a little heavy on the fog machine, and all the corpses are breathing and have eyes moving under the lids, but aside from that this is a fine picture. Even the old hag who played Mellisa's mother played a fine role.

So when you see a girl being trampled, you better help. Or else this could happen to you.",1103500800,3,1924,4.263013698630137
1245850,5,B00001ODHD,"Director Mario Bava (""Black Sunday,"" ""Black Sabbath"") creates an atmosphere gothic horror film in ""Kill, Baby, Kill"" (""Operazione Paura""). At first glance this is an old fashioned ghost story with all of the required horror movie elements, from the ignorant and superstitious villages, an old crone uttering curses, swirling mists, rooms strewn with cobwebs, and even a black cat. Of course there is also the one person who understands what is really going on and is ignored until it is way too late.
When Dr. Paul Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) shows up to perform an autopsy on a young woman who died a violent death, he finds a fear stricken town in the best gothic tradition. When he finds the victim has a coin embedded in her heart, the town's shameful secret is told: twenty years earlier a young child, Melissa Graps, was run over and left to die during a festival. The townspeople are convinced Melissa's ghost is driving the guilty to suicide by appearing to them, and the good doctor's plea for rationality is ignored as the townsfolk are whipped into a frenzy of fear by the local sorceress, Ruth (Fabienne Dali). When Dr. Eswai and the lovely Monica (Erika Blanc) go to the local castle, Villa Graps, they find the Baroness also dead, another apparent suicide. There is only one thing left to do; explore the castle and find its deadly secret.
Title notes: ""Kill, Baby, Kill!"" was the film's 1968 release title, although it was first seen in the United States two years earlier as ""Operation Fear."" Other reissue titles were ""Don't Walk in the Park"" and ""Curse of the Living Dead"" (not to be confused with ""Curse of the Dead,"" the release title in the United Kingdom). Whatever the title, this film is one of Bava's better efforts at creating an atmospheric horror film. Monica has a nightmare that is a very effective montage sequences. The film is also rather unique, especially for an Italian production, in that all of the really interesting characters are females, especially Ruth, who lends the movie some of its more effective twists. The more you can forget that this sort of story has been done to death in the United States in the years since 1966, the more you can enjoy this film. Certainly a lot more going on creatively both in front and behind the camera than you would find in the best Hammer films of the same time period.",1075161600,10,2350,4.7201946472019465

7914561,5,B00001ODHD,"A film historian recommended this title to me and I finally got it in the mail yesterday. I have to say that I was so impressed by this supernatural film that I intend to check out all of Mario Bava's horror films (in fact, there's a four-pack set here on Amazon that I intend to get, which includes Black Sunday and Black Sabbath). Watching this reminded me of Roger Corman's adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe's stories, and some of the Hammer films - rich in atmosphere, and suffused with imagery. I had actually seen this title pop-up on Amazon's recommendations for me many times, but the title always put me off. ""Kill,Baby...Kill!"" seems like a title that implies lots of blood and gore, but this movie is not a gore-fest. On the contrary, it is a highly atmospheric, well-plotted and credibly acted ghost story, one of my favorites in the horror genre.

Set in a small village in a European country sometime in the late 19th century (?), the movie opens with a woman falling to her death (against her will), and the creepy laughter of a child following this tragedy...we then see a young girl dressed all in white skipping down the stairs. Sometime later, a pathologist arrives in the village, Dr. Paul Eswai ( Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) to perform an autopsy on the corpse and determine the cause of death. Inspector Kruger (Piero Lulli) is the one who summoned Dr. Eswai, and both men find the village veiled in secrecy and fear. Eswai is assigned a nurse, Monica, as his assistant (played by Erica Blanc), and whilst performing the autopsy, the pair discover a coin buried in the corpse's heart, which Monica says is based on a superstition where the coin provides peace to the soul. Eswai later has an altercation with some village folk and is 'rescued' by a strange lady in black, who turns out to be Ruth, the local witch (Fabienne Dali). Eswai and Monica slowly unveil the village's dark secret that goes back to the past, in which a young girl, Melissa Graps died tragically in the middle of the village without receiving any aid from the locals, and has been a malevolent presence in the village ever since, bringing death and destruction to the locals. When Monica appears to be the next victim, Eswai races against time, calling upon Ruth to help him save Monica's body and soul from the malevolent spirit.

There is even a plot twist in the movie to keep things interesting, and the credible acting by the leads makes this an engaging watch.
Fans of classic, period, Gothic, and atmospheric horror will find much to appreciate in this gem of a horror film.",1256688000,,2567,4.664459161147903
7914562,5,B00001ODHD,"Getting this in a four-movie pack, this was the first of the four I watched. ""Kill Baby, Kill"", although should have a more suitable name, is a great gothic-horror movie taking place in Italy and featuring some very interesting characters. At first I was skeptical about the movie after seeing that the title didn't even fully fit on the screen, which is one of the signs of a cheesy, throwaway movie. HOWEVER! I found that ""Kill Baby, Kill"" was indeed quite an enjoyable atmospheric horror movie.

Although it's rather short compared to more recent horror movies, running at a little under 85 minutes, ""Kill Baby, Kill"" has quite a few highlights that'll make it worth your viewing experience. The stand-outs are, in my opinion:

1) The sexy lady that conjours magic spells and conjurations, and is dressed all in black. Right from there, the movie-makers got my attention and did something right...very right!
2) The creepy, mysterious little girl that seems to be the chase throughout the whole movie. She makes for an entertaining little misfit, especially watching the protagonist in search of her.
3) The super-awesome, uber-trippy dream sequence that features some of the best psychedelic scenery I've seen in horror movies! A scene like this seems rather rare in more popular horror films, but when it's done right, it makes for quite the enjoyable spectacle.
4) A happy and even heroic sort of ending that leaves you feeling satisfied. It's not all the time a horror movie has an ending that leaves you feeling satisfied with how the creators chose to end it, but ""Kill Baby, Kill"" has the sort of ending that leaves you feeling complete.

All in all, yes this is a dated movie, but ""Kill Baby, Kill"" is a gothic-horror masterpiece and, especially in this day and age, a rare novelty that should be enjoyed by all horror fans.

Only the TIM LUCAS commentary makes this version desirable, but the ANCHOR BAY version has the Italian Soundtrack! Save your money and get the Anchor Bay version. Who knows, In time maybe Anchor Bay will rerelease KILL BABY...KILL on Blu-Ray with Tim Lucas Commentary?",1242604800,2,382,4.632352941176471

Hands down, this is one of Mario Bava's best films, even better than his ""Blood and Black Lace.""  Bava has a great flair for the visual--the swirling mists at night, the bleak cobwebbed castle, the winding spiral staircases that seem to go on forever amidst kaleidoscopic lighting, the pretty blonde girl who giggles whenever evil is imminent, and, of course, last but not least, that ever-present ball of hers that bounces ominously in the dim-lit hallways.

It all adds up to that climactic surreal scene where the hero chases his doppelganger through the castle.  At this point, losing your sense of reality, you are swept into the maelstrom of the hero's topsy-turvy hallucinating mind as he takes leave of his senses.

To sustain the pervasive creepiness of this film, Bava uses that giggling urchin to fine effect as a chilling leitmotiv.  Like all the best horror movies, ""Kill, Baby, Kill"" is apprehended through the subconscious rather than through the conscious mind.

The only drawback to this DVD is the poor quality of the print.  The color looks bleached and anemic.

7914565,5,B00001ODHD,"Operazione Paura (literally translated as Operation Fear), is Mario Bava's 1968 gothic masterpiece. Released in America as Kill, Baby... Kill!, this supernatural chiller draws not on gore for terror, but atmosphere. Graveyards with wisps of dancing fog, gloom-shrouded alleyways, decaying architecture and the sparse, forbidding landscape are the true stars of this film. As with most of Bava's works, the storyline and acting is somewhat commonplace; it is Bava's skills as a director and the cinematography he demands for his films which sets his works apart from many of the other Italian horrors to hit the drive-ins and grindhouses from the `60's through the `80's. Seen forty years later, Bava's ability to create such atmospheric films with the budget available is still extraordinary.

A fearful young woman runs from some unseen malevolence through the ruins of a rundown Transylvanian courtyard. Up stairs and onto a platform, the woman seeks refuge from whatever stalks her; then, with a shriek, she falls from the platform onto the sharp spikes of a wrought-iron fence. The silhouette of a small child darkens the wall beside the fence, laughing. Thus Operazione Paura sets its tone, and all before the opening credits role.

Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) is summoned to an isolated village to perform an autopsy on the impaled woman by Inspector Kruger, who is investigating the death. The young doctor soon learns the superstitious citizens of this village believe the town has been cursed, and that the spirit of a seven year old girl, Melissa Graps, haunts the town, killing with a glance and seeking revenge for her unfortunate death some twenty years earlier. As the doctor arrives at the gates to the city, the silhouetted forms of four men stealing away with the coffin for burial in an attempt to prevent the autopsy foreshadow the resistance that is to be met with from the locals. To assist with the autopsy, Inspector Kruger selected Monica (an early role for Erika Blanc, who would soon become a famous vixen of Italian horror), a local who left the village at an early age and only recently returned. The autopsy is performed as scheduled, and the fear escalates. Local residents begin killing themselves after reporting to have seen Melissa Graps. Despite the fact that it is unnatural to touch the dead for an autopsy, someone is planting silver coins into the hearts of the dead. People begin to venture to Villa Graps, former home of Melissa Graps, which is still inhabited by the reclusive Baroness Graps, Melissa's mother. In the most chilling and memorable scene, the hand Melissa slaps a grim coated window; her pale face then slowly becomes visible.

Generally, there are to two color schemes used for Kill, Baby... Kill!. The tangible and natural scenes of the film use a nearly monochromatic palette, shades of reds tinted with browns, while the supernatural occurrences tend to be filmed using complimentary colors, vivid greens and reds. This is most noticeable in Villa Graps, where entire walls are lit green and reds pour through doorways. Effective for the most part, but the number of fluorescent green spider webs hanging from ceilings only allow the viewer to suspend disbelief for a limited amount of time. The stairway of Villa Graps likewise is lit from below with orange, and the lighting from above is a cold blue. This use of color lends a sense of vertigo to the spiral staircase, and in all the complimentary color scheme scenes, adds to the implied conflict on screen. Implied conflict is central to this tale, so the complimentary scheme is a logical choice. The struggle of science and superstition, good and evil, natural and supernatural is both as basic and complex as red and green.

The unique way in which Bava directs the camera will occasionally require a bit of getting used to for the uninitiated viewer. A scene with the camera zooming forward and up, then down and back and up, over and over captures the point of view of Melissa as she swings, overlooking the local cemetery at night. This swinging point of view continues perhaps a bit too long, before the camera falls back and captures a view of the graveyard with Melissa swinging before it. Obtrusive use of the zoom feature reoccur throughout the film, and while not as zoom heavy as a Jess Franco film, for instance, just as unnecessary. The ability to capture the interplay between light and shadow, to transform a breathtakingly beautiful landscape into a surreal, gothic environment of isolation and decay, and construct such realistically detailed, atmospheric sets give any viewer cause to forgive the experimental cinematography.

This film is not to be missed by anyone interested in horror genre films or Italian cinema. Bava has been referred to by some as the Italian Hitchcock, and this film is one of the reasons why. At one point, Warner Brothers' studios attempted to convince Bava to move to Hollywood for a contract with them. He turned them down, however, preferring Italy and its cinema to that of Hollywood. If Bava did not wish to move to Hollywood, his influence did, as can be seen in films by such directors as Francis Ford Coppola, Quentin Tarantino and David Lynch.",1221264000,,5220,4.974799541809851
