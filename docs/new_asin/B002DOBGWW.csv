3911996,3,B002DOBGWW,"The ONLY reason that I rented this video was because Jimmy James' song Fashionista was supposed to be on the soundtrack. Thankfully, the song is mixed in at the very end at the pivotal competition. The thing that really bothered me though is that his song, along with a LOT of songs from the film, never made it to the soon to be released CD soundtrack. This is a crying shame since the film did have some really good tracks in it. Overall it's a cute movie but not something I would sit through for a second time. For those also interested in the song Fashionista, it is available on his album ""Jamestown"" as well as a maxi single with some major stomping beats.",1252454400,,663,4.354838709677419
3911997,2,B002DOBGWW,"i'm generally a fan of the bring it on franchise, but this movie quite frankly sucked. while none of the other movies could be considered high art, they were entertaining and fun to watch. unfortunately, this movie isn't. the acting is atrocious, the cheer routines were bland, the story was boring. christiana milian proves that being pretty and able to sing doesn't mean you can act. and she was one of the better performances in the movie. many of the others were painful to watch, they were like midwest kids trying to play east la without ever having met anyone from there or watching any of the great movies placed there. they were caricatures overplayed badly. as for milian's character, I found myself not caring at all about her life and struggle to fit in. for a go-getter, she quit most easily when things got a little tough. most of the time, I had to keep reminding myself that she was suppose to be the ""hero"". by the end of the movie I found myself rooting more for ""avery"" the villian. as for the cheerleading, which the movie was suppose to be about., there is much less of it here than the other movies, at least it feels that way. there are few stunts and tosses, again that's how it feels. the routines seem blander, and the filming lackluster. you don't see full routines, just bits, and it's mostly filmed from a distance. you don't get the feel of the energy that filming in among the girls gives in the other movies. I could rant some more, but I think you get the idea. leave this one on the shelf. if it comes on tv, well maybe, but have something else to do when you get bored, because it won't keep your attention.",1252281600,3,1642,4.422442244224422
3911998,5,B002DOBGWW,"I know what a lot of people are thinking, OMG, another freakin' bring it on movie. First of all: The franchise is really a trilogy (1,3,5), 2nd: Give this one a chance, you will be surprised. There were new lines that are repeatable, mostly spoken by the Character Gloria. These movies do present an element of cheese, but let's face it, that is what makes them fun. You aren't watching these with the intent in finding a new oscar contender. As soon as it was over, I wanted to watch again, something that I would never say about any of the others, except for the original. The movie finally brought it!!!! The music was good as well. I never heard a Christina Milian song in my life, and now I am looking to buy the soundtrack. It was a mixture of the 1st and 3rd movies brought together with a Step Up feel. I loved it an now i will watch it again!",1252195200,13,851,4.226993865030675
