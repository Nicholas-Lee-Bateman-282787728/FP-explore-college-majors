7776392,4,B01H3TVVDU,"Overall I liked it but let me spell out the good and the bad for you...... The GOOD: It's the original tubes members in all their glory. Fee, Bill, Vince, Roger, Prairie, Rick and Michael at the height of their popularity after ""The Completion Backward Principle"". While I've seen the current version of the Tubes I never got to see the classic line-up so that is a treat. The BAD: The picture and sound quality are not that great. No remastered audio and video here. The audio sounds like a mix straight from the sound board while the video reminds me of a copy of a VHS tape. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers. Worth the price for true Tubes fans.",1481846400,6,650,4.380165289256198
7776393,5,B01H3TVVDU,"I saw the Tubes in 1983.!! Excellent musicians and I feel underated terribly time and time again.!! Are you a Tubes fan.?? If so, this DVD is a must.!!",1477785600,3,151,4.241379310344827
7776394,4,B01H3TVVDU,"I always liked The Tubes. As a gift for my 18th birthday my then girlfriend/now wife decided to let me choose 3 albums for a gift. I decided on three albums by people Id never heard up to that point in time. One was SIREN by Roxy Music, the next BORN TO RUN by Bruce Springsteen and the third was the debut album by The Tubes. Odd to look back now and consider that all three were critical darlings but never had a hit at the time. So to say Ive been listening to the Tubes since they began is not just a catch phrase but the truth.

The band had its ups and downs over the years but in 1981, after releasing 5 albums that didn't sell well, they finally hit it big it big with the album THE COMPLETION BACKWARD PRINCIPLE. The album produced their first hit single with Talk to Ya Later and they began making appearances on shows like SCTV. The thing about the band was that their claim to fame lay in their live shows, much talked about stage performances where any and everything could happen. This new release captures some of that.

The show Musikladen in Germany featured numerous bands at the time and The Tubes was one of those. This DVD captures their entire performance on that program in concert format, complete with dancing girls and the off color antics of lead singer Fee Waybil, antics that by todays standards aren't quite so alarming.

With the exception of the earlier mentioned single from the album most won't recognize the songs being performed here. But thats the thing about The Tubes. While their music was well written, well performed and contained some witty lyrics it wasn't the songs so much as those live performances that gained them notoriety. That one of these shows is actually captured and available on DVD is something fans should be thrilled with.

That being said there is a down side to this as well. The technology at the time was severely lacking when it came to concert films. Even the most spectacular and popular bands at the time weren't being recorded live with the best of equipment. Because of that there are moment while watching this DVD that youll wonder if its a disc playing or if someone broke out the old VHS player to show this concert to you. Yes the transfer is good but the source material was lacking.

But thats the only bad thing to say about this. As a fan of the group I enjoyed being able to see them live for the first time other than snippets of them on various TV shows. I was glad that a record of their performance was now available. Songs like Mr. Hate and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman are able to be enjoyed in a live version along with other great songs.

If you love The Tubes this will be a must have for your collection. If you're not familiar with them listen to a CD and then pick this up rather than dive straight into the live area. To do so might scare you off. Then again who would ever have thought Alice Cooper would be considered tame and mainstream. For something just a tad different, enjoy The Tubes and get a glimpse of this concert.",1477008000,5,3019,4.372549019607843

7776396,1,B01H3TVVDU,"Don't waist your money on this awful performance of the revamped Tubes doing songs I never heard before.  It's the 1980's Tubes with all the elements that made that decade make the Police seem like the best band around.  I wanted White Punks on Dope and I got nothing I like at all.  Otherwise it is fine, if like that kind of s***.",1476057600,,332,4.238095238095238

8764589,4,B01H3TVVDU,"Somewhere in the middle of their '81 tour, the Tubes broadcast their set for German TV. Raucous, rowdy and just before ""Theme Park,"" this is who they were for all the world to see. An occasionally missed high note here and there doesn't spoil the fun, and the audience loves it. Devotees will delight in it.",1495497600,,307,4.5

8764592,4,B01H3TVVDU,"First, The Tubes are for fans, but also for a small group about to be fans.  This is the original band if a bit removed from their most corrosive earliest years. Nevermind because theyve matured into excellent musicians besides being the off-kilter musical satirists still evident underneath the added polish as typified by the perfect hair-cuts.  Whats not so polished is this video is the overall quality.  Its pretty much a down and dirty Muskladen TV production wholesale.  The video quality as well as audio quality is dated.  It looks like what you might expect when VHS ruled and mono sound was the only option.  A better technical production could surely do the performance here more justice.  They say beggars cant be choosers and so it is were fortunate to have a video documentation of the band at all during their just beginning middle period.

Again, this is a video for fans mostly.  It is certainly interesting enough for others, but the songs will likely be those already acclimated to The Tubes to really bond with.  They were kind of like a San Fran bargain basement Queen.  Big guitars to be sure, but with a heavy dose of satire and kitsch that polarized their fan base.  It certainly cant be denied that within their wheelhouse these guys were more than competent musicians.  Sometimes it seemed like so many ideas struggling to get out it much was lost in craziness and little need for reigning it in to something more commercial.  Just go with it because art is where you find it seemed to be the filter these guys plowed their field in.  It definitely attracted a certain group of die-hard fans and only occasionally touched the mainstream.  That is where this concert lives.  It shows the band still on the left moving toward the center.  In that there is something special.  So, for the fan and the curious this is a recommended watch and buy.  For most it will be a little too strange and out there.  If you're reading this you know who you are.enjoy.",1490486400,2,1978,4.658959537572255
