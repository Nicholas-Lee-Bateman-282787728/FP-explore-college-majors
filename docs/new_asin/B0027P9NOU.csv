It's the fictional ""behind the scenes"" story of Steven Spielberg's classic JAWS as he (with the help of his good friend George) attempts to salvage the disastrous production of his first big film.  The script is peppered with references to other Spielberg films (so keep your eyes and ears open.)  What really sells the film is the on the nose casting.  While no one is a clone of who they are supposed to be playing, they do a great job capturing the essence of the character.  On top of all that it's absolutely beautifully shot.  The DVD is nicely put together with some bonuses but the main feature is the reason to pick this up.
Overall, while this film clearly walks the line of fan film and tip toes around copyright issues associated with that type of production, it never quite reaches the pop-culture relevance level as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Lucas-in-Love/dp/B000053VC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Lucas in Love</a>&nbsp;did.
