7839247,1,6303144322,"Honestly this special is one of the most disjointed and maligned things I've seen come out of the era of Video Game cartoons, and considering things like the Bubsy pilot that says something. Backgrounds seem to up and vanish from this 22 minute pilot like they cant think to add them in! And to save on having to properly sync up the mouth flaps of characters sometimes when they speak they just cut away to the frozen and lifeless background characters! Sadly this thing actually had potential as one of the better Ninja Turtles knockoffs and I could see it working as a full show, but it has such little effort and care put into it that it's obvious why this failed so badly. This having been based off one of Rare's hardest and most notorious video games makes it all the more shameful! I can get a weird so bad it's good feel from this and a cheap laugh but those of you with taste probably won't. Besides DiC did better video games cartoons anyways like The Adventures of Super Mario Brothers 3 and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog",1450742400,,1036,4.457894736842105

Even more then Batman & Robin if you can belive that. The action is silly & childish. Even The Carebears Movie had better action then this. The lines & battle cries like ""Let's get Worty"",""Cosma-riffic"" & ""psychotronic"" are dumb and made me wish for the jokes from Milton The Monster. The story is luke-warm at best. I seen better stories on TNA Impact. The animation is choppy ala Pound Puppies:The Legend of Big Paw. The music sounds like it came form the 50's instead of the 90's. The ending is a rip-off because no network in their right mind pick this crud up as a regular series. Overall:If you ever see this tape,BURN IT!!!I gvie this tape a 0 out of 10.",1290211200,4,818,4.352941176470588
