BUT NO!  she's hardly in the movie.  i was disappointed.  this left me so dissatisfied.  if anyone is interested in  all 7-90 minute volumes of emmanuelle with krista allen, i have them  available.  that's 10.5 hours of UNEDITED emmanuelle.  every volume stars  the lovely krista allen.  if anyone is interested email me at:  racketfury13@aol.com",959385600,7,453,5.041095890410959
1061559,1,6305731713,"I swear, what a rip off. Krista Allen sells this movie, and shedoesn't even do it. Well, do it right anyway. I swear if you have seenthe cable series, tape those instead... I repeat little to no Krista. WHY?",956534400,2,207,4.333333333333333
1061560,2,6305731713,"Ok, I found out the hard way, but I'm glad I did and now I can move on with my life. Being in love with Krista Allen as I am, I finally saw Emmanuelle in Space on Cinemax, a few of the episodes anyway. So when I  found out that First Contact was coming out on DVD, I got it of course. It  turns out that this movie is the movie that the Cinemax series is based  upon, sort of a ""pilot"" if you will. Therefore, all of the scenes  within the opening credits are from the Emmanuelle in Space series. I hoped  the DVD was going to show the best scenes from the series, but I was  disappointed. If that is what you want, subscribe to Cinemax. Krista is  worth it, because she is extremely nude, plus she has several encounters  with other beautiful women. First Contact gets 2 stars instead of 1 because  Krista does have one decent love scene in it. I wouldn't suggest purchasing  this, guys. Hopefully, the Emmanuelle in Space series will be released in  the future. Wait for that! Late!",955065600,22,984,4.236559139784946
1061561,1,6305731713,"I have to say when I watched this movie I was quite dissapointed. Krista Allen and Paul Michael Robinson really had the chemistry going in this one. But when they started getting hot and heavy we don't want to see ocean  waves going back and forth, clouds rolling by, shots of rolling  plains,etc,etc,etc...... We want to see what's going onnnn!  Too bad the  video company put it out in it's truncated form. There going to loose mucho  buckerinos!  STRIKE ONE TO THE VIDEO COMPANY THAT PUT THIS BOMB  OUT!  GET IT RIGHT!

7893234,5,6305731713,"Emmanuelle gets elected to become the captain of a group of strange, space men and women from a distant galazy, led by Haffron, a cute guy who knows next to nothing about sex.  Haffron has a sort of Patrick Swayze looks and must come from some kingdom too poor to buy any underwear.  Emmanuelle, ever playful, has had a showdown with her earth boyfriend, Philip, not a bad sort but a jealous fellow who won't let her explore her sense of adventure.  With this in mind, she has sex with Haffron as they perform monitored with a hundred wires which allow the rest of the crew to monitor their bodily sensations.

What can Emmanuelle, a lovely girl played by the incomparable Kirsta Allen, teach a bunch of overeducated, brainiac space creatures?  Well, first off, none of them have ever had sex since in their nation, to procreate one must simply slough oneself in two, and that's how children are made, therefore there has n ever ben a need for sex.  Bowever, Haffron so enjoys the earthly delights of Emmanuelle that he becomes a sex addict sort of, and poses as Emmanuelle's brother as she returns to earth to confront jealous Philip, who, as it happens, is giving his missing fiancee a taste of her own medicine by throwing a wild orgiastic party.  She twitches her nose and changes out of Krista Allen's body into another (so that Phil won't recognize her) and attempts to seduce him to test her theory that he's a cheater, while Haffron tries to pick up different [...] at the party.  They succeed and the two couples have sex in adjoining rooms.  Dumb old Haffron picks up a ""professional"" who asks him for $200.  ""What's 'money'?"" he asks in his inane royal hiccup.  When he drops his pants her eyes widen and she rushes right over.  ""Never mind, this is a freeby!"" she announces.

In space, Emmanuelle accepts the thanks of the space people for treating Haffron so well, but says that even becoming their queen  won't satisfy her need for travelling to Egypt so they better let her abdicate.  Instead, they accept all her conditions, and allow her to go on her planned barge down the Nile on a swinging singles cruise.  Haffron accompanies her, telling her he loves her and to prove it, he says, that even if she changes her body for another female passenger, he will still know it's her, instantly.  Farcically he fails to identify her and beds four other women, all of them charming and witty and nubile, but none of them really up to Krista Allen's gold standards.

Badly shot on cheap video stock, but highly recommended nevertheless.  FIRST CONTACT's a winner all the way through.",1154822400,6,2592,4.63238512035011
7893235,3,6305731713,"I'm not sure what everybody is up in arms about. I watched the movie a few hours ago and saw plenty of Kirsta Allen, though, except in the beginning, she was mostly dressed. I think the reason, is the version I watched, which I rented from Caf DVD, was unrated. Anyway the other girls were nothing sneeze at and though the sex scenes could have been more sensual there were plenty of them. Overall I thought Emmanuelle in Space - First Contact was an average soft porn flick. Hence the three star rating but only the unrated version.",1137542400,2,533,4.448979591836735
7893236,5,6305731713,Now if any of you have ever read one of my reviews you know that I take movies at face value. I don't read into them... I don't look to them for hidden meaning or anything like that. That being said why are we trying to find quality in porn. I know this might come as a shock to you all but this is porn... soft-core safe for the teenager in you porn. Nothing more. Saying that I'm disappointed in this movie is like saying that the production value of the hardcore movies is terrible. Why... Why waste your time reviewing this...get what you need out of it (and you all know what I mean) and move on,1040083200,14,600,4.093220338983051
7893237,3,6305731713,I have waited so long to see this movie and i was very disapointed with it. The only thing good about it was Krista Allen and she was hardly in the movie. The sex sceens weren't even that great. There were very dull and boring. Very bad r rated version and im not sure if the unrated is much more. Im glad i didn't spend movie to buy this. If you want to see a good Emmanuelle movie see Emmanuelle 5 the best of all.,971395200,10,416,3.9058823529411764
