3967393,1,B002QH4R54,"When a rural radio station received reports that locals are being infected with a ""rage"" type virus, they hunker down in the basement radio room to survive and to report on the unfolding disaster. When I saw PONTYPOOL with a couple of fellow Zombie film fans; two of us thought that this was a large steaming pile, while our artsy buddy loved it. PONTYPOO, as I shall now refer to this film, is a dialog driven Zombie picture that should appeal to many critics and the art house crowd. Although this dung is quickly fading from my memory, I shall try to resurrect enough of it to qualify my remarks. Many have applauded the psychological aspects of the picture, and if that is your thing then by all means scoop it up. Although the film waffles between being a Horror and a drama picture, most fans of Zombie films want CARNAGE, (of which there was little in this film). Cripes, the one scene that held promise for some serious ripping just showed the backs of the zombies then the camera cut (or panned away). What a tease. That is like making a porn film without T&A. I'm not a ""Philistine"" as I love art & culture, including cinema (even silent films), and most genres of Horror, (including Zombie films). This picture, however, offers little to the connoisseur. Don't bore me either with the social messages that are said to pervade such films as they allow film makers to hide behind a shoddy production. I want to be entertained, and not have to attend the theater with a clipboard in one hand and my University Psychology books in the other. Adding to this bore-fest the film was almost entirely shot in one room. This material is actually more suited to live theater rather than the cinema, (where it would have been far more effective and I would have been more forgiving). Although lead Stephen McHattie did an admirable job under the circumstances, (he carried the film), even he could not rescue this from the sea of mediocrity. I will admit that the build up of tension was very well handled, however, this proved to be too much of a good thing without a pay off. The film also failed to answer many key questions such as what caused the outbreak, though there was an inference that the spoken English language was the agent responsible! WTF! I am as open minded as the next person but the film failed to present such in a credible manner and I was unable to make the leap necessary to buy into it, (though I wanted to). Other random thoughts; the makeup was amateurish, (stage one Zombies again), the set decorating was minimal and uninteresting and the few Zombies seen were unconvincing. Some of the camera work was also spotty though being confined to one room may have had something to do with it. Some of the acting was spot on while at other times it was suspect. The film was also ponderous as the pacing was slow and it seemed to take forever to see a Zombie. Further, that the movie poster appears to show an exploding Zombie head, replete with splattering blood, like a victim of a Romero head shot. Sadly, nothing of the sort happened here, and I conclude that the poster is actually misleading. Also misleading is a reviewer's comment on the front of the box art that says this film is ""Funny"". One of the few good things about PONTYPOO is that it is straight as the Director avoided the dreaded Horror-Comedy combination. This is (thankfully), a serious attempt at a Horror film. There is nothing funny about it. So, the box art is also misleading. In fact, that about sums it up, that PONTYPOO is nothing but a big tease. The positive film reviews I have read are just another example of what I call ""The Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome"". In other words, despite the praise, this is a marginal film at best, but just watch the sheep jump onto the band wagon because others have praised it for being different as well as a superior Zombie film. That in itself is not really a positive as most Zombie cinema is indeed wretched. I can see some positive elements such as McHattie's shock jock DJ performance and the tension build up in a claustrophobic setting, all of which were well executed. In reality, however, the film maker took the safe and easy ""Psychological Horror"" route because he was unable to blend true Horror with the classic Zombie. That in itself is a tall order, but pull it off and you will have a monster hit. PONTYPOO is still the tease that fails to deliver and offers further proof that there are many so-called ""Horror"" fans out there who are easily satisfied. This is an economy Zombie film that while featuring a couple of new twists with some professional gloss & convincing psychological drama, remains largely formulaic, that is; survivors hunkered down in a fight for survival, (though there is not much of a fight). You will either love or hate this film. Not recommended for hard core fans of Horror, though artsy-fartsies and pretend fans of Horror will have a field day with this one. Just watch where you step...
Note: Check out SOCKMONKEY's Amazon review titled; ""I'm sorry, kiss is...what?"", which is located in the book section under the title, PONTYPOOL CHANGES EVERYTHING, (though the review is for the movie). SOCKMONKEY's summation, (quote); ""I think this is a unique case of subtext crowding out the enjoyment of a horror film"", best sums up the issue I had with this film. This reviewer also dared to challenge the mind set of the Canadian art house movie scene, to the scorn of others. Right on! Again, the Emperor's New Clothes syndrome at work...",1257552000,13,5518,4.620162932790224
3967394,4,B002QH4R54,"While broadcasting his daily show from the local radio station in the small Ontario town of Pontypool, shock jock Grant Mazzy discovers some strange things going on. As he reports on the infestation of a strange virus that leads local residents to behave violently, he comes to suspect that he is himself spreading it through his words.

Pontypool is a small and deceptively simple film, that takes place almost entirely inside a local radio studio, but manages to feel dynamic and engaging throughout. The isolation of the location suggests a central theme of the film, how easy it would be to lose contact with what's really going on for one who characteristically spins the truth, and whose contact with the world outside (at least for several hours each day) is through the medium of screened phone calls and wire reports. Until the fairly recent big budget Hollywood zombie craze, the zombie phenomenon in film almost always stood in for larger social issues, and this Canadian thriller revives that tendency. While provocative and shocking radio is often entertaining, what does it do to our psyches? What happens to culture when dangerous and sometimes outrageous ideas and interpretations of current events, intended to keep people listening to the radio, begin to be accepted and embraced as truth? Crazy ideas can, after all, spread like viruses, raising fear and paranoia and anger. There's also a distinctively Canadian theme here, suggestive of the Canadian francophone fear that the universality of the English language may corrupt culture.

Of course, what you really want from a zombie film is terror and thrills, and, at least in the latter half of the film, Pontypool delivers the goods in a mostly satisfying way. It's not a perfect film, as there are a few plot gaps and underdeveloped characters and elements and a bit of lag time and at times the modest budget shows, but on the whole this is an entertaining and provocative film, that looks good throughout and keeps you involved and guessing.",1256860800,,2016,4.997023809523809
3967395,4,B002QH4R54,"Pontypool is not your typical horror flick. In fact, the movie is more than half over before you see the first drop of blood, and even then there is hardly any gore or carnage in the film. The majority of the film takes place inside a small, rural radio studio in Canada during a snowstorm. The characters inside are hearing about mysterious things taking place in town, and trying to figure out what is going on-- and how to keep whatever is happening out there from happening to them. The beginning of the movie is a little slow as the characters are developed, but the tension keeps on building up as bits and pieces of information filter in to the studio. There are some scenes of attacks, but what is actually scarier than those few scenes are the scenes featuring telephone calls from witnesses describing what they're seeing. Somehow, hearing from a person who is obviously terrified and in danger intensifies the listener's feelings of dread and horror more than actually seeing it. Definitely sends chills down your spine.

Another great thing about Pontypool is that it isn't your typical zombie or monster movie. The film is based on a short story by Tony Burgess called _Pontypool Changes Everything_. Without giving too much away, the story is about a horrific virus that originates in Pontypool, and this film is about those early moments when some people are just starting to become infected and others are just starting to figure out that something very, very wrong is happening. The virus itself is one of the most original and unique concepts to come out of the scary/horror movie genre in a long time.

All in all, this movie features hair-raising suspense, original ideas, and a minimum of gore. The perfect ""thinking person's"" scary movie. Hope you like it as much as we did!",1256342400,3,1796,4.771704180064309

3967397,4,B002QH4R54,"I discovered author Tony Burgess from a short story in VICE magazine, then went on to find and read other works by him. What amazes me about this film is that it successfully translates Tony's sometimes difficult, playful, experimental writing into film. (He wrote the screenplay.) I hadn't read the source novel so didn't know what to expect, but this is a pretty well-done film. Despite being set basically in one location the whole movie, it keeps the viewer engaged with a lot of stuff going on on a lot of levels,and is well-acted and darkly funny. The character of Sydney drove me nuts in the beginning with her micromanagement and attempts to keep things sunny and shallow, but things take a twist with her, which I found impressive. In this film you get a lot of Tony's trademark themes: gore, bodily disintegration, zombies, language, and surrealness. I think I might like an adaptation of the n-Body Problem a little better, but this is worthwhile viewing. French-Canadian horror, largely psychological but also a little violent/gory, set in a depressing yet beautiful deep winter.",1469059200,,1091,4.967213114754099

What I got was a very ""talky"" film where 90% of the events weren't shown, only described, by an off-location reporter.

3967407,5,B002QH4R54,"The main concept of this movie, that a deadly virus can spread by words/repetition causing violence, horror, and death, is not a completely new science fiction concept. However, the twist the movie brings to the concept is amazingly well executed for an indie film.

While the film is not the same as the book at all, the concept in science fiction/horror has precedence in books like ""Snow Crash"" (Neal Stephenson) and to some extent, as early as ""Blood Music"" (Greg Bear). About 2/3 through the movie, I realized what was tickling me in the back of my mind (ironically enough, given the subject).

One of the central concepts of the aforementioned novels as well as ""Pontypool Changes Everything"" by Tony Burgess, on which this movie was based, was that a virus could be both transmitted by blood as well as by sound to hit the deep structures of the brain. That is what this movie invoked with the main concept of the movie - that a deadly virus can spread by words/repetition, causing violence, horror, and death. While that isn't a new concept, how the movie brings it slowly, terrifyingly to life on the screen is amazingly well executed for an indie film. One particular example that was unbelievably well done was the 'kill is...' scene. You truly aren't sure how it will end.

Kudos to the director and actors, especially Stephen McHattie and his IRL wife Lisa Houle. It is impossible to convey most complex books in a movie - but this movie pulls it off. The sci fi/horror concept was not immediately clear (though it is introduced almost immediately, which becomes obvious later on). Since it is a new, unusual idea, it takes time for both the characters and the audience to realize what is going on.

The characters were believable and likable from the start; you want them to survive, to win. Once the epidemic is well underway, the story builds to a heartstopping conclusion. The use of v/o instead of music at the end was a nice touch, particularly when the broadcaster catches the virus himself.

NOTE:  There's a cute scene at the end after the credits between McHattie and Houle.",1442102400,2,2097,4.7315068493150685

3967422,5,B002QH4R54,"Grant Mazzy is a talk show DJ who's just been fired.  Coming into his last shift, he and his two producers get some disturbing news about a riot taking place in their small Ontario town of Pontypool.  The situation begins to spiral out of control, and people start dying, and the world as we know it may never be the same.

I won't say much more about the plot; it's hard to describe PONTYPOOL without spoilers.  Perhaps this best describes it: it's a thinking-man's zombie film.  Although it's not really a zombie film, but there you have it.  It's a film that explores culture and linguistics, that pits the horror genre against itself.  It's a character study (anchored by a fantastic starring role from character actor Stephen McHattie) set against an apocalyptic backdrop (probably).  Tony Burgess's script (based on his novel) is smart and savage, with doses of dark humor that actually enhance the horror going on.  Bruce McDonald's direction is sure-handed and solid, limiting the film mainly to the radio station studio.  The supporting cast--Lisa Houle, Georgina Reilly, and Hrant Alianak--give realistic performances.  The entire film is anchored in reality; this is one of those movies you watch and think, ""Well, if this were to happen, this is how it would happen.""  This reality, combined with the intelligence behind the premise, is what makes PONTYPOOL so terrifying.  If you want jumps and dismemberment and the typical cliches, go elsewhere.  If you want a film that will linger in your dreams, will keep you thinking the next day, give PONTYPOOL a shot.",1402790400,,1573,4.9541984732824424
3967423,3,B002QH4R54,"This movie was interesting, but wasn't the greatest.

This movie is about a burnt out radion shock jock in small town/somewhere Alaska.
At the start of his radio shift all is well but as the day progresses strange happenings, Happen.
Next thing you know people are going insane, the crazies are out and about and all hell breaks loose.
No one knows how, or why it just does.
At one point a Dr. tries to explain the happening but even he really doesn't know what, how or why. So it leaves you guessing.
The movie kept you going and wondering what was going on.
The whole movie takes place in one room, one building and with only two characters.
You only see zombies within the last 30 min of the movie, if you can even call them that.
They are a horde of people who are infected by a sound virus so its kind of like a brainwashed zombie.
There wasn't much to the story line, no explanations, no hints, no past,
no government cover up and no one person spilling the beans.
So you will be left with a WTF question at the end of the movie.
In my opinion they (the zombies)if you can call them that, are not what a true zombie is but the last of the film seemingly somewhat fits the genre...

I've never seen another flick like it.",1401840000,,410,5.134328358208955
3967426,4,B002QH4R54,"Pontypool is a difficult film to classify, in my opinion. Most who view it will feel comfortable saying it is simply a ""zombie horror,"" which makes sense, but I personally feel the movie moved beyond that in its approach to that which infects the characters. I will say this from the outset, if you want to watch a smart, psychological thriller wrapped inside a zombie horror, with plenty of suspense present, this is a film you should watch.

The film's setting is the small Ontario hamlet of Pontypool which is beset in the dead of a snowbound winter. Stephen McHattie's character (Grant Mazzy) is a radio personality who has obviously fallen on humbling times. You'll find his character is not only enraged at his agent (for his inability to find him a more prestigious market), but Mazzy has been the architect of his own demise to such a low, meager market. Mazzy is a cynical, opinionated, alcoholic whom we find was drummed-out of previous jobs due to his confrontational style.

Mazzy's rebellious nature surfaces quickly when the station producer/head Sidney Briar (played by Lisa Houle) has to constantly badger him about keeping focused on simply reporting the news and playing music and commercials without providing his usually-biting commentary. A sympathetic ear is lent by assistant Laurel-Ann Drummond (played by Georgina Reilly). These three characters are the principle focus of the movie as the overall plot becomes more apparent. This initial character development was extremely well done.

Reports begin trickling into the station about a heretofore unheard of event in this town: a riot. A friendly citizen who poses as a news helicopter (when he is actually sitting in his car on a hill overlooking the area) phones-in reports of what looks to be a civil disturbance at a Doctor Mendez's office, but then unfurls quickly into a violent assault in which the building is partially demolished with several fatalities and the appearance of a convoy of military trucks. ...And then the line goes dead as the citizen loses his cool and simply wants to escape the area. And this is how much of the action is conveyed: via phone reports. I found this to be an extremely effective and unsettling way of painting the setting of a rural area suddenly beset by outright, unexplained mayhem.

More reports begin flowing and then flooding into the station, but Briar in a managerial fashion, demands that Mazzy conduct an in-station interview of a singing troupe cast in an area musical. Mazzy is brazenly nonplussed while listening (and openly mocking them), but the plot is advanced directly on scene. After the troupe finishes their song, one of the singers begins babbling unintelligibly to the confusion of everyone. However, with an additional phone call from the midst of the violence occurring outside, we begin to realize that those committing the violence as well are babbling and repeating strange phrases. The suspense is ramped-up when station assistant Drummond begins repeating her words as well. Lending clarity is Dr. Mendez, who barely escaped his demolished office and appears with the infected on his heels. From there, all involved play a part in solving what ails the town.

What I liked most about this film is in its unique take on a zombie-like infestation, it doesn't degenerate into comedy relief or guns blazing. It was intended to start AND finish as a psychological thriller as well as a horror film. The way the ""disease"" is spread is a brilliant take on this genre especially when compounded by what looks like a purposeful presence of the military. Don't get me wrong, I've immensely enjoyed certain comedic or shoot-'em-up zombie films, but Pontypool was not intended to be this. For an independent film, its production values are not only excellent, but completely acceptable and believable to the audience. You have no choice but to experience the cast's isolation. Bruce McDonald did a great job directing a terrific script by Tony Burgess, on whose novel the film was also based.",1401494400,3,4027,5.013452914798206
3967427,5,B002QH4R54,"When PONTYPOOL begins, you might think it's a noir-style thriller or mystery.  It hooks you in much the same way as one of those.  Once it takes a sharp turn in the horror direction, you're in for the ride and waiting to see what will happen next.  That it manages to go off into an unexpected direction from there is a real treat.

It succeeds as a science fiction movie with some odd twists and turns.  But the best thing about it is the radio studio in which most of it is set.  They could have performed the story as a stage play (and maybe that's what is was, originally), or even as a radio broadcast.  But what I liked most was the studio itself.  Something about that place made me think of NASA control rooms.  It seemed a place from which the world could be saved.  This is probably due to the era in which I was raised -- technology was dials and gauges, pipes and switches.  How I would love to work in a place like that. I loved being in that control room with the characters, and damned if they didn't figure out -- well, you'd better watch and see for yourself.

3967435,4,B002QH4R54,"The movie tells the story of the eponymous town of Pontypool  and a bizarre virus that is spreading through the community, causing widespread chaos and rioting. But this is not your typical zombie (infected) flick. The vast majority of the story is told from a small, isolated radio station where the stations manager, production assistant, and star D.J. are hold up, describing to the listeners what they are hearing from reporters in the field. Adding to the interesting take (spoilers ahead), the virus is transmitted by words rather than microbes, a nice twist on the notion that words can induce action in the people who hear them. Good movie. I recommend it.

4 Stars

Bonus: The first lines may be the best part of the movie. I reproduce them here.

Grant Mazzy: Mrs. Frenchs cat is missing. The signs are posted all over town. Have you seen Honey? Weve all seen the posters, but nobody has seen Honey the cat. Nobody. Until last Thursday morning, when Miss Colette Piscine swerved her car to miss Honey the cat as she drove across a bridge. Well this bridge, now slightly damaged, is a bit of a local treasure and even has its own fancy name; Pont de Flaque. Now Collette, that sounds like Culotte. Thats Panty in French. And Piscine means Pool. Panty pool. Flaque also means pool in French, so Colete Piscine, in French Panty Pool, drives over the Pont de Flaque, the Pont de Pool if you will, to avoid hitting Mrs. Frenchs cat that has been missing in Pontypool. Pontypool. Pontypool. Panty pool. Pont de Flaque. What does it mean? Well, Norman Mailer, he had an interesting theory that he used to explain the strange coincidences in the aftermath of the JFK assasination. In the wake of huge events, after them and before them, physical details they spasm for a moment; they sort of unlock and when they come back into focus they suddenly coincide in a weird way. Street names and birthdates and middle names, all kind of superfluous things appear related to each other. Its a ripple effect. So, what does it mean? Well it means somethings going to happen. Something big. But then, somethings always about to happen.",1388793600,3,2127,4.709677419354839

I hate zombie movies, and the entire zombie craze. I hated it way back when I was bombarded with zombie media as a teen, back in the previous frickin' century. So I am definitely not one of the viewers who expected a gory good time. No, I was told this was a smart horror flick.

Spoiler alert.

Pontypool does a good job of holding an intelligent viewer's interest, but does nothing to pay that interest off. If you want to see a movie where all the characters are likable, and they all die, and you'll never understand why, but you might feel for 30 seconds as if someone's trying to update Mad As Hell and Not Gonna Take It Anymore for the scary West of the early 21st century but with zero conviction or ability to have the message understood, Pontypool is about 95 minutes long.",1384819200,,1121,4.328571428571428

Pontypool is a unique ride into the zombie movie genre.  It is one of those movies that you can watch 20 times and still get something new out of it that changes your perception of the movie quite remarkably which makes it a perfect addition to your movie library.  Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of this movie because the visual and the fear is provided by the viewer in his/her mind, not the movie screen.

Grant Mazzy is a morning radio show host in a small town in northern Canada (Pontypool) where the big news is ice fishing disputes and reading school snow closures.  But when their `eye in the sky' news & traffic reporter in the field, who really just sits on a hill in his Dodge Dart overlooking the town, sees a large crowd around a Dr.'s office and then witnesses the building `explode in an explosion of people' it becomes apparent something strange is going on.

As the viewer, you only can hear the reports coming in from around town and see the confused and concerned expressions on the faces of Mazzy and his two co-workers manning the phones.  As the reports progress, it becomes apparent that there is some kind of outbreak that is making its way closer and closer to the radio station.

I really have enjoyed watching this movie numerous times as it continues to reveal more and more detail as to how this mysterious disease or virus or whatever it is continues to spread.  There are some things that I still don't quite understand so I presume I just need to watch it some more until I finally ""Get it"" but until then, I will continue to avoid using terms of endearment, conflicting phrases, and the English language.

So, what does it all mean?  Well... it means something's going to happen.  Something big.  But then, something's always about to happen.",1376870400,,1812,4.572755417956657
3967442,5,B002QH4R54,"Horror doesn't have to be in your face. It can be about ideas. It doesn't have to be about the immediate, strictly visceral thrill.

The best horror can leave you thinking - actually thinking - for days or weeks after.

Which is why Pontypool is a beautiful little zombie movie. I watched it several days ago and I'll be thinking about the closing monologue and several of its ideas for quite some time.

There's some blood - it's projectile, even - but the film nonetheless leaves out most of exactly what many think is the most important part of a zombie movie - namely the cascading guts. The tale mostly happens in a claustrophobic basement radio station with the zombie attack being literally phoned in - we mostly get only audio of the atrocities until the final reel.
For me, this only heightened the sense of paranoia. We are utterly restricted in point-of-view, confined with characters who are not sure what is real, what isn't. They don't know the parameters of this thing and, for various reasons, the truth is not readily forthcoming from any of their limited sources.

Another reason I enjoyed Pontypool is that I love language and the power of langauge. Stephen McHattie is brilliant as disgraced shock jock Grant Mazzy, who has a deft control of and love for both expressing the truth as he sees it and the spoken word itself. He and his producer, Sydney Briar (played by McHattie's real life wife Lisa Houle), soon begin to understand that the virus affecting the citizens of the small Canadian town of Pontypool has something to do with language - those afflicted begin repeating words or sounds, stuttering, losing the ability to think clearly, quickly degenerating into a zombie-like state. Their grapplings with and solutions to the problem are both brave and brilliant, making for a number of tense and surreal scenes.

I'm giving the movie five stars despite several flaws - partially because I suspect the screenwriter, novelist Tony Burgess, a semiotics and linguistics expert adapting his own novel, might have intentionally included several of them. For instance, there's A Doctor With An Accent Who Figures Stuff Out - he (quite literally) slips into and out of the plot a little too effortlessly, too conveniently. There's an obituary reading which, though poetic in its own twisted way, couldn't realistically happen in quite exactly the way it does. Plus a television in the studio or Skype on someone's cell phone might have changed things significantly, etc.

But these are minor quibbles, and, like I said, given the eventual theme of the film - that language and expectations can be used to make zombies of us all - Burgess and director Bruce McDonald's not sticking to a strictly linear cinematic logic might have been a completely conscious decision.

Note: A freind emailed me to watch while wearing headphones and to stick with it all the way through the credits. I'm glad I did both.",1376611200,,2923,4.869215291750503
3967443,5,B002QH4R54,"Pontypool was adapted from the novel Pontypool Changes Everything by the author Tony Burgess and directed by Bruce McDonald. While the argument can be made that it is a twist on the Zombie genre, McDonald spoke out against classifying this film as a zombie movie at Rue Morgue's Festival of Fear expo in 2008. I won't get into exactly what he said, as there are some spoilers within the statement that I think would do a viewer a disservice to know before seeing the film.

This film is not for the blockbuster amused, or the hardcore gore fans (although it has it's moments). This film is perfect for those with a great imagination and who still find that they can scare themselves at night when they are all alone. The look of the film is very dark, but lit perfectly so that you never strain to see what is happening. The dialogue is what sets this movie apart from the rest. Burgess gives you such great dialogue that it will not only keep your attention, but it will also challenge you to think.

Stephen McHattie (""Watchmen"", ""A History of Violence"") plays Grant Mazzy, the brooding radio announcer who spins a finely silken web of words to appease his new station manager Sydney, played by Lisa Houle (""Emily of New Moon""). Together with Georgina Reilly (""Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal"") as the technical assistant Laurell-Ann, they work towards updating their listeners on local news of the morning when all hell starts to trickle loose.

Although most of the film takes place within the radio station, there are still plenty of shots outside of the station that remind you of just how alone we all are at 6:00am, when the sun has yet to make itself known, and the night still holds all of us captive.

You should definitely give this film a chance and join the cast on a blind journey into the unknown, where fear truly terrifies.",1375142400,5,1842,4.641104294478527

3967445,3,B002QH4R54,"Horror movies and sci-fi movies often fall victim to a particular bad habit that drives me crazy:  the poor explanation.  These movies deal with ""weird"" things happening.  Sometimes, no real explanation of how these things came to be is needed:  we understand a ""ghost haunting a mansion"" without needing a lot of rationale behind it.  Sometimes things just are.  Think of George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  The dead were coming to life and feasting on the living.  Why?  Who cared?  No real effort at an explanation was offered or needed.

Sometimes, though, one of these movies will postulate an unusual scenario that may be very intriguing, original, scary, creepy (or any combination of those)...and it will offer explanations of what is happening.  Yet the explanation is either vague or offered speedily where you can't keep up or is even meant to be somewhat incomprehensible.  For a good recent example, PROMETHEUS seemed to offer up answers...but it only gave a few pieces of a puzzle.  I don't mind ambiguity if that is the intent, but some films either a) think they're giving you all you need to know to understand what's going on or b) they want you to THINK they're giving it all to you, when they're actually holding back.  In either case, it's aggravating.

And it's particularly aggravating when the movie is otherwise quite enjoyable.  I just watched the ""zombie"" movie PONTYPOOL, and really enjoyed great heaps of it...but was flummoxed by the supposed ""explanation"" and ""cure"" that was offered up.  I understood up to a point, but in the final few scenes, the lead characters had some sort of additional breakthrough in their understanding that I didn't follow.  So, instead of enjoying the tense final moments of the film, I was sitting in my seat trying to make some sense of it, and hoping against hope that the final pieces would be given to me.  But sadly, I think the filmmakers thought they HAD given all they needed to.

So the movie ended up making me feel a little stupid.  Perhaps if I watched it again, I'd catch more...but there are so many movies I haven't seen once, I'm not going to spend another 97 minutes watching this one again in the hopes of understanding more.

PONTYPOOL is set almost entirely in a small radio station in the small town of Pontypool, Ontario, Canada.  We see talk show host Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie, never better) arrive for another shift.  He's apparently a big name in talk radio, a shock jock, who has lost his big city job and is now relegated to a sleepy backwater town.  He's asked to report on school closings and community events.  His efforts to provoke his audience are not appreciated by his producer Sydney (Lisa Houle), so he's turned to drink and simply going through the motions.  On this particular day, the snow is coming down hard, and the whole movie is permeated with a tangible sense of coldness.  Grant, Sydney and production assistant Laurel Ann (Georgina Riley) are ensconced and entrapped in their basement studio.  And that's when weird things start happening.  In a series of very effective scenes, Grant interviews the station's traffic reporter Ken (whom we never see) as he witnesses riots turning deadly at a doctor's office and later, babbling mobs killing and eating innocent bystanders.

The word ""zombie"" is never used, just as it never comes up in 28 DAYS LATER...but this is a film about people catching an easily communicable disease that causes them to want to eat uninfected humans.  I don't want to spoil just what seems to be causing this zombie-like behavior...but let's just say it causes the affected to behave in strange and remarkably creepy ways.  This is a tiny, quiet movie about the zombie apocalypse.  But its claustrophobic nature works FOR it.  We actually see very little happening (enough, but less that movies usually give us)...we hear it.  So as the sense of disbelief gives away to horror amongst the crew of the radio station, we feel a sense of dis-ease settle over us.  This is not a scary movie, exactly...it is extremely creepy, however.  A sense of dread is well developed.  PONTYPOOL is based on a novel, but it was also once a radio play.  And this makes total sense...I can easily imagine the radio play, because in a way, the movie feels the same way.  Lots of listening to phone conversations.  Lots of talking.

PONTYPOOL is not a fast paced film, and will not appeal to fans of zombie movies with lots of gore.  Bloodshed is at a great minimum.  But I personally appreciated the uniqueness of the approach...we are sitting in this radio station in the cellar of a church right with these 3 characters...and we listen to the horror going on just outside and closing in ever faster.  I very much appreciated the tone of the film, the fine performances and the unusual setting and approach.

But, as I said before, I certainly didn't enjoy being left out in the cold as our main characters had their big breakthroughs in the final scenes.  Could the writers NOT have been just a little clearer?  Could the actors NOT have enunciated a bit more carefully?  Could an editor not have left a smidge more in?  Could the director not have looked at the final product with the eye of the intended audience?  I admit, I may simply be a bit dull-witted and missed a perfectly clear explanation...but assuming I'm not too stupid, I really feel this largely successful movie let me down in the end.

3967457,4,B002QH4R54,"Pontypool(released March/09)stars Stephen McHattie as Grant Mazzy,Lisa Houle as Sydney Briar,Georgina Reilly as Laurel-Ann Drummond and others. This is a small cast and budgeted Canadian film that puts a very simple concept into action,which blossoms forth into a very scary and deep psychological horror/Sci-Fi film. In other words,it is making something big from something little. And the surprising thing of all is,that against all odds,it works.
The story finds a radio talk host,McHattie,in the rural town of Pontypool,Ontario(in the Kawartha's).He is a drinker and has been fired from his big city gig,and has been forced by circumstances to try his luck out in rural Ontario. His first morning there he spends trying to ""get"" his audience,and their attention(""Take no prisoners""),while getting on the last nerve of his female producer. On his way into work that snowy and cold morning,he had a very brief encounter with a woman who came towards his stopped car,then mysteriously backed away.
The first glimmer of something really amiss comes when the stations ""eyes in the sky"" reporter witnesses the walls of a doctors office burst outward,with many people dying in the process. As they try and digest this their broadcast gets interrupted by a transmission in French,which we later learn is from the military. They ask people not to use any terms of endearment and not to speak English. Things start spiraling downward from here,even to getting a hook up with a BBC program who seem to think this incident and others they have heard about there,are related to separatist activities. The stations""eyes in the sky"" reporter now becomes holed up on a farm and witnesses the crowds walking by and their strange behaviour and babblings. Eventually the reporter himself starts to talk in riddles and they must cut him off.
Time passes and the doctor,whose office walls were blown outward by a sea of people,arrives at the station. The talk host,the producer and doctor,hole themselves up in the sound booth. The station assistant starts to act erratically and she eventually kills herself outside the booth trying to get in. Then the station itself is under siege from the populace. Gun fire and explosions are heard on a more and more frequent basis as the military has moved in and are trying to control the situation,but speaking over loudspeakers,only French. The talk show host and his producer come to the conclusion,with the doctors help,that it is certain words and their understanding of them that have somehow infected the people. This then leads people into a stage of confusion,being unable to express themselves. They then,as it was described in the film,start chewing or biting at other people,usually their faces/mouths. Before they can get their message or ""cure"" out to the locals,the station is bombed.
Yes,words DO in fact kill in this film. It is a verbal virus that turns seems to short circuit peoples minds and turns them into dazed and confused individuals. Zombies,as in viral infected individuals,they are not. The actors here go through a broad range of emotion from the first frame to the last. McHattie turns in a boffo performance as the talk show host who not only has to deal with a career demotion,but his first day there feeling his way through,THEN to top it all off the circumstances that follow. His producer has the same kind of emotional charge as McHattie,yet from her producers perspective. As the tenseness of the action heats up so does the rising emotions of the actors to match it,level for level. It was a fine performance by all.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35;1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary and the radio adaption of the film.

To those that thought it was stupid, I'd suggest you go and watch something else that doesn't require much brain. I like the fact that this got me thinking and wondering about the possibility about such a thing. The idea of an infectious thought is certain no less ridiculous than the idea of dead people walking around eating brains - I'm personally much more afraid of infectious thoughts than the bite from a dead person.

Sure, I'll agree it's not perfect, but honestly, a perfect movie is a VERY rare thing. I just ordered the ""Hellmouths of Bewdley"" trilogy that this falls into the middle of and can't wait to read.",1355097600,2,1076,4.434343434343434
3967465,5,B002QH4R54,"I'm a fan of words. What people say, how they say it, why - I'm pretty passionate about it. And that's what makes Pontypool so intriguingly creepy.

The entire movie takes place within a small-town radio station in the middle of a snowstorm. For the first half of the movie, everything we know about the mysterious events taking place in Pontypool, Ontario comes through the station's callers, in what is literally a game of telephone with stakes much higher than anyone could guess. In the second half, the violence in the town spreads to the station, and the truth behind the epidemic is revealed - or is it?

Pontypool is a clever movie with a few laugh-out-loud funny moments and building tension, particularly in the first half. Stephen McHattie's brilliant voice carries the majority of the film, even when it threatens to get ridiculous. In fact, the movie relies heavily on sound, which is both thematically appropriate and genuinely creepy, particularly combined with the isolation of the snowy station and claustrophobia of the sound booth. Some tension is lost with the dramatic reveal halfway through, but the movie is fast-paced enough to not outstay its welcome.

*Mildest of spoilers* As for the reveal itself, let me say this: it is incredibly unrealistic. As unrealistic as the biology in your typical zombie movie. Probably it serves a similar purpose, as a kind of societal allegory (which I have my own theories about, but I'll let you all decide for yourselves). I'm a linguist, and I know that this twist is patently ridiculous, but frankly, I still found it more compelling than the similar plot point in Snow Crash. Pontypool doesn't make the mistake of trying to explain something that is scientifically unjustifiable - it just takes a ""what if"" scenario and runs with it, and I'm okay with that.

If you want an apocalyptic zombie movie with desperate survivors staving off hordes of undead, this may not be the best choice for you. But if you like radio programs, low-gore psychological horror, or language, give Pontypool a try. Just listen.",1352678400,,2069,4.919770773638969
3967466,3,B002QH4R54,"Out of all the movie I've watched lately I've hardly come across a good one. That's worth my time and PontyPool isn't one of them. It's not a bad movie, it's not a great movie, it's just an okay movie. It's okay because the story never has any real sense that the characters are in danger or fighting for their lives. There's no climatic escape, no near death experiences, no epic battle. It's a horror movie without the ""horror"". With no real action and 99.9% of the movie all occurring in the exactly same place (minus .1 for grants drive to work) the film really never changes gear. It's like it just rides around on cruise control till the end of the movie. Being that I enjoy horror more than just about anything else I found Pontypool lacking what makes a horror movie a horror movie. There's no ""scares"" and certainly nothing to be frightened over in this movie.

 It does put a different spin on the idea of a virus spreading and making people loose their minds but that's mostly it. The rest of it can be about the quirky acting which is good but, the move just feels like a bore once you realize not much is going to happen and never does. It is one of those ""make you think"" movies but these aren't the days of the ""twilight"" zone. Where people sit back and use their ""imaginations"" to carry out what the movies lacking. If anything it makes me want to imagine I was watching something else that was more exciting. It's always hard rating films that have all the elements to be good but never seem to have them applied right to actually make it good. This film has good actors, a potentially good plot but, it never really goes anywhere and just seems stuck on the same note. Its story tries to focus on building fear and danger but the characters never experience those type of fearful situations or real danger. What you really have with this is a ""Science Fiction Film"" disguised as horror. I don't expect a Sci-fi movie to be scary but I do expect a horror movie to be scary, and this isn't horror dammot, It's Sci fi!",1352246400,,2033,4.375661375661376

3967470,4,B002QH4R54,"Pontypool is directed by Bruce McDonalds who has mostly worked in Television as of late though ha s had a few movies in his past. The film itself is an infection and outbreak film that has a few unique twists you won't see coming if you haven't read spoilers and I felt were executed amazingly well. It was written for the big screen by Tony Burgess who is the author of the novel it is based upon, ""Pontypool Changes Everything."" Now while this isn't strictly a zombie film it is close enough where I felt a review should be done. The 'infection' itself does not spread the way a normal virus does nor does it bring back the dead. It does however spread QUICKLY like a regular zombie virus would AND the infected act very similar to zombies. I don't count this film as a zombie movie however it's close enough to style and concept that I felt it worth doing a review to suggest to you.

The film focuses on an ex-shock radio host named Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) who has fallen from grace from the major radio networks in Canada. He recently was fired from a large show that he was doing and now is stuck working in Pontopool, Ontario where he considers each piece of news to be nothing but painful to have to report as there is nothing overly controversial that he can focus on. His entire way to receive ratings is to get people worked up and his new show follows the same formula as much as possible even though he clearly on a much tighter leash than he is used to.

We enter on a day that appears to be perfectly normal for the station but soon realize that something is happening. First a few reports of random violence and murder it quickly builds up as there is an increase of reports building up. The problem is that with the reports we are hearing as the hysteria increases is that there is an increase in people not making sense with what they are saying by either repeating themselves or just not making sense. People are angry, confused, scared, and its becoming nothing but hectic in the streets and soon surrounding the station as well which come to a head as people in the station itself also stop making sense. Grant in a random train of thought comes up with the solution to the problem and it's one that is completely terrifying in nature. Language itself is what is causing the epidemic.",1348963200,2,2312,4.412177985948477
3967471,4,B002QH4R54,"** This review contains spoilers. **

Grant Mazzy is a shock jock who used to be big on the radio, but now is condemned to the purgatory of a small town local morning show. He wants to challenge people and incite a reaction like he used to, but his supervisor, Sydney Briar, is only concerned with the basics. Weird reports start coming in from various eye witnesses about riots outside of a doctor's office. Over time, the details come together and the picture starts to become clear: people have started to suddenly go insane and attack others. People are being eaten and killed out there. Their town has descended in to chaos and all they can do is try to report what they know, which isn't much. How long will they be safe holed up at the studio? What is really causing this frightening behavior in people?

I read the book this movie was based on and it was very strange and nonlinear. I didn't really know what to expect from the film version, but I braced myself for weirdness. The film is linear in its storytelling, but still has the ambiguity and odd feeling of the novel. The film is separated pretty clearly into 2 parts. The first part is simply establishing the characters and then throwing them into a crazy situation that they struggle to figure out. There are only three main characters: shock jock Grant Mazzy who is desperate to keep some of his edginess in a run of the mill job, Syndney Briar who is Grant's supervisor and sympathizes with him but also wants to keep the necessities in her show without alienating her audience, and Laurel-Ann Drummond who is the idealistic technical assistant and slightly enamored with Grant. The radio show goes on like normal for a little while until one of their reporters calls in terrified of a large crowd of people outside of a doctor's office, attacking and eating each other and gibbering incoherently. Then, thing hit close to home when their studio is attacked on all sides and Laurel-Ann becomes infected. They experience the horror first hand and try to not contract the disease themselves.

I really like the new concept of zombies in this film. The disease is a virus transmitted through speech and only exists in the English language. It manifests in three stages. In the first stage, the person gets stuck on a word and keeps repeating it over and over without even really realizing it. The second stage is where their ability to speak coherently at all fails and they get frustrating at not being understood by others. The third stage manifests in violence when the frustration gets to be too much to bear and the person with the virus has to attack and eat other people, usually one specific person whose speech they mimic until their victim is dead. The most frightening version of this in the film is when Laurel-Ann becomes infected and goes through all the stages in front of them. The way she continually throws herself against the glass of the sound booth to get at them with no concern for her own well-being is more frightening than a horde of zombies trying to get into the studio.

Three things worked extremely well for me in this film. One is the part where people are calling in and relaying the horrors they have seen to Grant. It's horrifying to hear and feel their terror without seeing what is causing it. The visuals we as the audience can conjure up in our minds are much more frightening than anything any filmmaker can put on the screen. This scene is quite disturbing and more effective than I thought it would be. The second is the claustrophobic setting. Except for the very beginning, the entire film takes place in the radio studio building with only 3 characters being the main focus. The studio itself is fairly small and gets even smaller when parts of it are inaccessible due to zombies. It makes it seem like their whole world is reduced to that small building (or just parts of it) because the world is no longer safe and the danger will eventually make its way to them. The third is the disease itself. It's so unique and weird, but is used as a commentary for our society. People in this film turn murderous when not understood, but language in American society is becoming more and more distorted and less important. The vast majority of people would rather watch a film than read a book and abhor watching foreign films because reading subtitles is too much of a chore. Language to a lot of people is reduced to 140 characters tweets, Facebook updates, and text speak. Discourse and real language is no longer a priority to our society when Jersey Shore is one of the most watched shows on TV.

I really like Pontypool. It is an unexpected film that is a great addition to the zombie genre. Stephen McHattie, Lisa Houle, and Georgina Reilly give great performances that really set this film apart from the shambling masses of zombies films. The only thing I didn't like about it was the very ending scene after the credits. It just served to confuse the audience. The story is undeniably unique and may not be for everyone, but I would encourage any zombie fan to give it a try.",1347753600,8,5089,4.600220264317181

Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) is a fallen from grace radio newscaster who likes to philosophize his broadcasts to the dismay of his small Ontario town employer Sydney Briar (Lisa Houle).  Laurel-Ann Drummond (Georgina Reilly) who screens calls and runs the boards likes Mazzy's style and sides with him in minor disputes with Sydney.

As Mazzy starts his broadcast the town goes viral in an ""Impulse"" (1984 Meg Tilly) type of way. What I disliked about the DVD cover description is that it gives you the cause of the infestation, which takes away from the fun of trying to figure it out. The production is shot rather modestly inside a radio station. This could become a zombie play, although the infected people are not true zombies even by our expanded movie definition.

The production has a unique plot and well played. It would definitely make for a conversation piece of anyone's zombie collection.

During what he believes to be another standard radioshow, it quickly turns into something more when they get a report from their weather and traffic helicopter reporter Ken about a possible riot at the office of a Doctor Mendez in Pontypool. It's at that point things begin to get more exciting.

Taking inspiration from Orson Welles' infamous radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds, Pontypool makes use of your imagination and that's what makes the movie as great as it is.

Small-town radio station, unique disaster. ""Grade A...one-of-a-kind zombie film. A witty, gory little tour-de-force."" - Schwarzbaum, EW ""Top 5 of 2009."" - DreadCentral""

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!
Unless you are afraid of the English language, you might feel the same as I did when they tell you that English words, and only English words, are how the virus spreads. Once you understand a key word in English your mind acts like a computer caught in a loop, which for some reason makes you want to kill someone and then yourself. I think they have done this movie an injustice calling it a ""zombie"" movie, to me it wasn't even a horror movie. It was a suspense thriller than had a ""The Sopranos"" end. It is implied that the military blows up the town, there is a countdown from 10 and after 1 the screen goes black. I gave this one star because most of the movie made me really interested and excited for the end, but the end was very disappointing. I felt like ""The Happening"" all over again.

3967484,5,B002QH4R54,"It was late, I was bored, and this looked to be a better than average zombie movie. After all, Steven McHattie is a good old B+ grade action hero who can chew scenery along with the best of them, And of course, it was made in Canada, by Canadians, and whether its Da Vinci, Intelligence, or Nero Wolfe, those folks can't seem to let low quality work out the door. I watched Pontypool on Netflix, now I'm here on Amazon to buy myself a copy.

First, Pontypool is indeed a better than average horror movie, with a fair share of edge of the seat moments, and gruesome blood lettings, but it is more than that. Most important, Pontypool shows a quality of writing and delivery of dialog that outclasses any simple B picture. The entire action of the film takes place in a radio station and much of the dialog is just spoken into a microphone, or called in by telephone by reporters and eye witnesses, and yet it is far from dull and expository. Another reviewer wrote that the script could be broadcast unchanged over the radio and, like all great radio drama (and Canada is of course one of the few places where that still exiats) the writer and cast deliver more excitement, tension and color in their spoken words than all the 3-D cameras in Hollywood could ever deliver.

Finally, Pontypool is not just a zombie movie. As I said, it is in one way a better than average horror movie, but then you have to add an extra measure for its allegorical exploration of what we do with our language, and what in turn it does to us. If you've enjoyed any of the Philip K. Dick inspired quasi-SF fantasies of the last few years (A Scanner Darkly, Imposter, Adjustment Bureau, etc.), then Pontypool will give you similar food for thought.",1334620800,,1725,4.473015873015873

This movie may well be the most original horror film I've seen in quite some time! It's a text book example of what you can't see is more scary (down right creepy!) than what you can see in a horror film. At least the first two thirds of the film, & the rest is worth the wait!

They start getting phone calls about mass groups of people killing each other, even eating one another! As their in a basement on a cold snowy Valentine's Day, they can not see the outside world, & at first think it's a hoax, & this is where things get ultra creepy, as their imaginations, & yours, start to run amuck! Their isolation from the outside world in their cave like basement, only makes things more potent!

Superbly acted, directed, & scripted, this is a intimate tour de force of horror! Especially good is Stephen McHattie, as the jaded, sarcastic, morning DJ. His role is one of the most multi dimensional I've seen in a horror film in a long time. His acting is hypnotic!

i thoroughly enjoyed it.  loved it? i can't decide, so i take that to be a no.  glad i watched it?  totally.  would have paid to see it?  probably not.  so why a four star rating?  it was unexpectedly character driven.  i felt like much of the conversation between the characters could have actually come out of a real person's mouth.  also, there is nothing overly done with regards to the set.  obviously being limited to a handful of scene locations means the set isn't huge to begin with, but too often the environment in movies feels staged. this one less than most.

finally the concept of language as a vector of disease is intriguing and while not altogether original in theoretical debates of philosophy and culture, not something i've seen applied to the notion of a real disease.

3967496,5,B002QH4R54,"Pontypool is a unique take on the horror genre that will inevitably be paired with other zombie films.  That's a shame, because Pontypool is so much more than a zombie flick.

Pontypool has superficial similarities to the 2007 zombie film Dead Air.  Both films featured shock jocks (Stephen McHattie as Grant Mazzy) trapped in a recording studio reacting to the zombie infestation on the air, with live reports from their colleagues in the field of the infestation.  The similarities end there; where Dead Air reflects on terrorism in America, Pontypool considers the virality of language.  What if an interdimensional invasion was launched through speech? English words have different meanings depending on tone, inflection, and circumstances - what if certain words, like ""honey"" were infected?

Pontypool reflects on the use and abuse of words.  Throughout, Mazzy the former shock jock spars with conservative station manager Sydney Briar (Lisa Houle) over what's appropriate on the air.  Mazzy discovers a series of harsh truths through his coarse handling of his radio subjects: the cops he jokingly accuses of alcoholism are really alcoholics, the weatherman calling in from his helicopter is actually driving around in a van, and the small Ontario town of Pontypool is not interested in shock talk...until the news itself becomes shocking. Throughout, Mazzy transforms from cynical commenter to a freedom of speech crusader right up to when the ""zombies"" start banging on the studio's doors.

The crux of Pontypool is a question of whether mass communication does more harm than good. Mazzy is torn between going off the air to prevent the spread of the virus and using his mouthpiece to warn the citizens of Pontypool of the plague. Mazzy's ego, like the plague itself, won't let him stop talking.

The word virus in Pontypool is explained by Dr. Mendez (Hrant Alianak) as a scrambling of language from another dimension.  The infected attempt to find an audio frequency and after getting stuck on a particular word, begin to mimic the sounds they hear, eventually chewing their way through the mouths of other victims. Director Bruce McDonald calls the infected ""conversationalists.""

Pontypool could easily be a stage play, relying on the timbre of McHattie's voice and the panicked reports of weatherman Ken Loney (Rick Roberts).  Much of Pontypool's horror is through sound, be it the increasingly terrified Loney or the bizarre mutterings of the infected. Pontypool is a feast for the ears.

Pontypool gradually makes less and less sense as the film progresses. The good doctor conveniently shows up at the recording studio to explain how the virus works. Technical assistant Laurel-Ann Drummond (Georgina Reilly) gets infected, trapping Mazzy, Mendez, and Briar in the recording booth. And then Mazzy comes up with a variety of plans that range from common sense (he wants to leave the studio) to insane (he doesn't want to leave the studio).

SPOILERPOOL: There's a reason for this.  About mid-point through the film it reaches a creepy high point in which we listen to a conversationalist's mutterings...and from then on Mazzy is likely infected.  His dialogue becomes increasingly unhinged.  Knowing Mazzy is infected, when he doesn't, only adds to the terror and helps reconcile the nihilistic ending. But don't feel too bad.  The end credits are proof that Pontypool has a sense of humor...and that transformation through language goes beyond the physical.

Like The Ring and Inception, Pontypool adds radio to televisions and dreams that we didn't realize we should fear all along.  After all, the audience spent 93 minutes listening to the virus.  Not infected yet? Did I mention that lurking in the center of Pontypool is the word ""typo""?",1327190400,4,3760,5.190397350993377

I can't exactly put my finger on why zombies are so interesting to me, but they are. I thought I had seen everything the zombie genre had to offer. I was wrong.

Pontypool is one of the most interesting and polarizing ""zombie"" films I've ever seen. It's not the best one, but it's originality and unique take on how the infection spreads make it one zombie film every horror fan needs to see. I will say this: you will either love it or hate it. After reading many reviews, it's clear that some people think it's brilliant while others think it's trash. I say give it a watch and decide for yourself.

The film is based off the novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pontypool-Changes-Everything/dp/1550228811/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pontypool Changes Everything</a>&nbsp;by Thomas Burgess, who also wrote the screenplay. While they both share the same writer, the book and the film are very different in terms of perspective. The film is more straightforward, but this is not a bad thing. The story takes place almost entirely inside a radio station in Pontypool, Ontario and follows the radio crew as the outbreak begins. Very little of the outbreak is actual shown, with most of the carnage being described verbally. This turns out to be extremely effective because the audience's imagination creates things way more terrifying than anything the filmmakers could've shown on-screen. I know this will turn some people away, but with all the in-your-face shaky-cam horror crap out nowadays, it was quite refreshing to be scared by something so simple.

I didn't want to give away major plot points, but they're why the film is so good and I want to address them - there's a reason I put the word zombie in quotation marks above. You have been warned:

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

The most intriguing aspect of the film is how the infection spreads: through the English language. It sounds stupid, but somehow it really works. Just the idea that speaking certain words can potentially turn you into a mindless, flesh-hungry creature is utterly terrifying. Some people may think this is ridiculous, but the way the film conveys it makes it seem very plausible. Our brains are just computers, right? Don't computers sometimes mess up, getting caught in endless loops or becoming infected with viruses, causing them to behave erratically? The notion that your brain can turn on you like that is very unnerving to me. The director has stated that the creatures aren't zombies but something else, dubbing them ""conversationalists"". Whether or not they can be considered zombies is up to you. Regardless, the methods they devise to combat the virus are ingenious and clever.

**END SPOILERS**

The film's cast also does a tremendous job. Stephen McHattie, who you might recognize from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen/dp/B001FB55H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen</a>, is outstanding in his role. He plays a former ""shock-jock"" forced to do morning traffic reports. McHattie's voice is almost hypnotizing and you hang on his every word, making what would be otherwise boring scenes very engrossing. Special mention must go to Rick Roberts, the actor who voices the radio crew's field reporter Ken Loney. We never see this character, but his vocal performance was so filled with genuine terror that I was literally on the edge of my seat. It actually creeped me out, something which doesn't happen very often. The rest of the cast does a fine job.

The cinematography looks fantastic. It has a very industrial feel to it, with lots of blues and greys, making scenes seem cold and unwelcoming. The snowy setting also increases the feeling of isolation. The score is minimal but highly effective, complementing the action and scares nicely. All of these things really enhance the film's atmosphere and make it all the more unsettling. The gore is minimal but well-done; if you're a gorehound, this is NOT the movie for you.

To sum things up, Pontypool is definitely a thinking man's zombie movie. It presents some very bizarre concepts that it makes the most of, really going for broke. If you're expecting standard zombie fare, you will either be very disappointed or (un)pleasantly surprised. It's a weird and interesting film that is definitely worth a look.",1324425600,2,5180,6.065573770491803
3967507,4,B002QH4R54,"""Just listen to me.""

You wouldn't know it, but this little dialogue blip haunted me just long enough to know that, subsequent to viewing the trailer, McDonald's Pontypool would be an experience I would never forget.  Just when cinema's zombie revival experiment begins to show signs of banality, we are given a gift from an ambitious director that, although certainly difficult to digest, is one the most compelling and original zombie in ages.

Working with truly terrifying source material, McDonald builds a fortress of tension out of, seemingly, nothing at all.  Indeed, nearly the entirety of the film takes place within a radio station, and even then, within the confines of a modest sound booth.  That said, it is a testament to the staggering talent of both the director and his team when I say that what is accomplished with so little is utterly unnerving.  Even for minimalist cinema, this is a film that works with mere shadows, putting its faith in the audience to fill in the frightening details.

Pontypool is that rare horror film that grows more disturbing upon successive viewings.  Given its plot, which I will absolutely not spoil, it is admittedly ironic that, the more you analyze and come to learn, the more creepy things become.  It's a stunning achievement that I cannot applaud enough; it goes beyond mere psychological horror, nestling quietly in the voids of the uncanny and the abstract, and it will chill you to the bone.

Indeed, this film oozes a taut indy style that few mainstream features can replicate, all the way down to a genuinely sharp script that gives the impeccably chosen cast something intelligent to work with, especially Stephen McHaddy's, who's performance is the stuff of career breakouts.

It needs to be acknowledged that, yes, Pontypool is a zombie movie for people who don't want to watch the conventional zombie movie anymore - at least those that aren't directed by Danny Boyle.  And no, it doesn't necessarily require a patient or tolerant mind to enjoy the film.  That said, this certainly isn't something that you would see greenlit by the heavyweight studios, and for good reason; it lacks the docu-mocku style that has become prevalent in the genre; nor is it a shock-fest; and it is completely devoid of recognizable names.  But for those who have the opportunity to get their hands on McDonald's ingenious little gem, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better thinking man's horror film.",1324166400,29,2447,4.951100244498778
3967508,3,B002QH4R54,"IMDB describes this film as ""A psychological thriller in which a deadly virus infects a small Ontario town.""

That's good if you need to describe the film in 13 words or less, but such a description misses the mark. Ponypool can't be lumped in with other thrillers about virus epidemics, it is much more than that. Ponypool is actually quite a unique horror film in the zombie apocalypse sub-genre, with the suspect virus stemming from the psychological. It is base on the story ""Pontypool Changes Everything"" by Tony Burgess, and well worth the watch.

Veteran radio jock Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) is en route to a new gig in Ponypool, arguing with his agent along the way. Driving through near blizzard conditions he stops at a traffic light and is startled by a woman who bangs on his passenger side window. She's hardly dressed for the weather.

She's saying something, but he can't understand so he rolls down his window. She starts backing away from the car as he calls to her. No one else is in sight, be he hears voices. Oddly, the voices are repeating his own words, like echoes.

Arriving at his new job he settles in behind the microphone and talks with his audience. He asks them if they think he should have called 911. After all, the woman could have been in trouble. But actually, she was more like a warning of trouble yet to come.

As the film unfolds Grant Mazzy works on building a relationship with his new audience, and delivers local news items and other information fed to him by his producer and engineer. Only the three of them are present at the studio for the late night radio show. The studio building is otherwise vacant, dark and quiet, except for the loudspeakers mounted outside, broadcasting the show to the winter storm beyond.

One news item involves a local doctor's clinic being overrun by a riotous crowd of people. The station's ""eye in the sky"" roving reporter calls in to cover the event, and he shares observations of strange behaviors. The people he sees are walking funny, talking funny, and some seem to be trying to eat others.

It has something to do with the words. And broadcasting their signal outside may not be such a good idea, because before long a crowd begins to form around the studio, effectively trapping Mazzy and his crew inside. The people are repeating words, over and over.

The doctor who managed to escape the clinic arrives at the studio, and they let him inside. He sheds light on the situation, the virus, and how it spreads. They bring him in to the soundproof control room so Mazzy can interview him on the air, his producer joins them, but their engineer begins acting strangely. She seems sick, and walks away for a little while.

After sharing the doctor's insights with the audience, and warning them of the virus and the zombies, they are startled when the engineer returns, bloodied and crazed. She begins running herself, uncontrollably, into the window of the control room. Mazzy, his producer and the doctor look on in horror.

Trapped, with zombies starting to make their way into the studio, they must learn how to beat the virus, and escape the zombies to survive.

The ending is a little simple, and somewhat anti-climactic, but it works well enough. The ending, after the ending, is odd and has a little Tarantino, disjointed, Kill Bill feel to it. Strange.

In all I found Ponypool to be very entertaining, suspenseful and scary, as well as mildly disturbing on a psychological level. Pontypool, Pontypool. Something is always just about to happen, isn't it? Isn't it?

Turns out that his mouth has gotten him kicked off the airwaves and he's getting one last chance in the only town that would take him.

As the radio host and friends make preparations and baton down the hatches they slowly discover the strange reason for Pontypool's decent into madness.

However, I find the way the ""zombies"" in Pontypool become infected totally absurd... a phrase of the English language turning folks into zombies / ""virus being spread through language"", really? Sure, it is a new spin on zombies and the writers thought outside the box and good for them... but that idea made about as much sense to me as filming a remake of Night of the Living Dead in 3-D... (ooh, giant joint coming at you in 3-D... ahh,  3-D pot smoke in your face), but infection via language just killed the movie for me.
28 Days Later and the remake of Day of the Dead (minus the annoying stereotypical Hollywood action Nick Cannon character) are two great examples of zombie movies where the writers thought outside the box! I just wish the makers of Pontypool had made a non ""zombie"" movie with their new fangled yet far fetched idea, or just stuck to some of the good old ways of zombieness.
And now to touch on the comparison of Pontypool to Dead Air.... I don't care which came first... there is no comparison for me. Not to sound like a zombie movie snob, but when I want to watch a zombie movie, I want zombies (wither infected humans or reanimated dead bodies) trying to eat humans and humans trying to survive and not get eaten by zombies. I also need to be able to suspend disbelief, a ""lets pretend for just a moment that this could really happen."", and language being the cause of ""infection"" was just too ridiculous for me. Dead Air had believability and lots of zombie chomping action!
Pontypool was a well written and produced movie. The actors were great at acting. And the plot, aside from the way people became infected was great, for a psychological horror movie, but there was just not enough zombie action goodness for me.

One thing I will say is; if you're looking for a Dawn/Day/Night of the Living Dead kind of zombie flick (or even Shaun of the Dead, for that matter), then you may be disappointed. HOWEVER, if you're willing and open-minded enough to give this little indie darling a chance, I think you'll be very pleased and probably impressed.

First off, the acting is top-notch. Steven McHattie deserves a lot of credit for carrying this one. The rest of the (small) cast also deserves kudos for pulling off this, ""tell-don't-show"" story. Secondly, the film does a phenomenal and creative job of ""telling"" the audience what's going on without actually ""showing"" you. This, and McHattie's performance, are what impressed me most. The tension is very subtle, but it builds beautifully to dramatic and climactic effect. Thirdly, while the gore-factor is considered low and tame by modern horror standards, what gore there is, is done perfectly, and only adds to an already tension-filled and dire situation.

Bottom line: This movie does exactly what it sets out to do. It creates a great atmosphere filled with interesting characters and a lead actor capable of contending for an Academy Award (if given the right role in the right movie).

The movie is very well made but, the premise is just not that entertaining.

All it is, is a talk radio station that describes a zombie invasion. Instead of actually seeing the carnage, you just get to hear it get described...in dramatic fashion.

While the movie has excellent acting and intriguing atmosphere (which you must have to pull this off), since there is nothing visual going on, your typical horror fan will be bored.

A similar, yet highly superior film, is Oliver Stone's ""Talk Radio"". That movie is so much better because it uses the radio format for suspense but corroborates it with visuals. With that movie, it involved the concept that the DJ was going to get killed with the suspense being who and how would this inevitable killing take place. In ""Pontypool"", the premise of ""zombies"" should require visuals (it's a monster movie after all...show me the monsters!)

If this was a play, I would find ""Pontypool"" mesmerizing. However, in the world of movies, since there is nothing to see, I find this to be boring.",1297382400,,1347,4.946902654867257

3967524,5,B002QH4R54,"A few days ago, a friend who shares my interest in unusual films told me about Pontypool: ""Forget 'Catfish' (a certain movie we'd been discussing).  I can't find it anywhere; get it!"" he told me, with breathless enthusiasm.
I translated this to mean that ""Pontypool"" was going to be somewhat difficult to find; I should, however, locate a copy by any means necessary, view it immediately, and call back for further cinematic discussion.

I located ""Pontypool,"" watched it, and was completely engrossed.

The film's premise, coupled with how it is framed inside a paradoxically rustic and bleak radio station, surrounded by an impersonal landscape, falling snow, and bitter cold, is completely
original: everyday language, but especially the kinds that we take for granted, ""terms of endearment"" (honey, darling, baby), and ""babytalk"" (cooing and burbling), are conveyors of a weird infection that
obliterates people's minds and turns them into raving psychopaths.

One of the film's most fascinating aspects (which is mentioned, occasionally, but not really developed) is that the radio station and its operation may be directly tied into spreading the language virus, thereby
perpetrating the very horror that it is ostensibly trying to stave off.  In fact, when Ken Loney (the guy in the ""Sunshine Chopper"") calls the station and transmits a victim's final words (spoken in French) over his cell phone,
which are simultaneously broadcast to the listening audience and then translated into English, the last words of his message are clear: ""Do not translate this message into English.""  Thus, a kind of linguistic ""tesseract""
is created, giving way to a very, very interesting new horror paradigm.  This destabilizing use of words to explain a problem, which, simultaneously, furthers the problem it seeks to solve would, of course, take the viewer down
a fairly convoluted ""rabbit hole.""  So perhaps the abbreviated explanation/development of this concept is more in keeping with moving the film's narrative along.  But it is a fascinating and weird logistical conundrum, and it really
is the film's underlying theme.

Very good performances from all the cast.  Even the Ken Loney character's disembodied voice (emanating from a make-believe weather helicopter) is effectively eerie and frightened.  Probably one of the most
original and truly frightening movies I've seen in a while.

3967526,5,B002QH4R54,"When the town of Pontypool woke up this morning, they never expected a day like today. Neither did the D.J. taking to the town's airwaves or the people outside of the town or the rest of the world. Something starts to happen, however, and it is one of those weird little things. People basically start to lose it, sometimes in some singular way and sometimes in larger groups, and that leads to massive amounts of madness. As the things start to become worse and the world looks on, the answers become odder and the words said become stranger and stranger.

Pontypool is an interesting idea but it is one that develops strangely. Iy has a lot of ideas it wants to try and develop, too, and those ideas are not exactly the easiest to get across. Sure, some of them sound like they would work when you start to try them out, but how easily does something come across when you put an idea into practice? Vague - I am trying not to spoil anything so it is that. Still, it is a valid concern when you get into just what is driving people to the brink.

When it comes to the acting in the movie, you have different flavors that move througout the film. Sometimes it is one of those moments when a person is trying to say something with overacting in their minds and sometimes it is a perfect delivery that happens to take place. Regrdless, it works out in large part because the movie is a broadcast that we are tuning into, and we hear some of the horro as it plays out. That means that we hear a lot of people, sometimes at the wors tof times and sometimes at their end, and it stretches the notion of what is happening.
I like it, too, and the way it plays out.

The people that become ""infected"" are not in the movie a lot, but when they are they are inspiring to a degree. sometimes it is the way that they showcase madness and sometimes it is the way that they bang their head against a soundbooth. whatever the case, the force of the movie is in that and in the wording and in the motions that sleep between the this and the that.
It is watchable, but it can become convoluted when you hear some of the explanation.

When it comes to wathcing this, I am of two minds. I liked the movie BUT i like a lot of movies, and some of it threw me when it was explained. As I said before, there are ideas and there are ideas with explanations attached. These sometimes are threadlike in their ties that bind and, in the process of showcasing the intellectual, they lose people. This can be a really flawed thing when it comes to the delivery that sleeps in a movie that is not bedgeted to compensate for that, and I am not certain that everyone can overlook that. If, however, you do not mind the ""why"" and enjoy the chase, then this is a nice fim. It has a broadcast that explains everything and it captures a lot of what extras oftentimes try to accomplish. This makes it a strong 4.5 or 4.6, rounding into the B-movie 5 star roster.

It is unsettling, funny, has great performances, and forces the viewer to use their imagination. Most of the action takes place inside a radio station as we hear what is happening in the outside world, and like the characters in the movie, the viewer is trying to piece the puzzle together. The reason behind the mayhem is a mindbending, David Cronenberg-inspired outlandish concept. It's never really explained why it happens and there is much left to interpretation. Thus, this kind of film will ultimately loose 75% of your typical audience that insists on simple ideas tied up in pretty bows at the end.

But yikes, the plot, the set, the dialogue, and the performances felt like something concocted by a high school drama club.  Even the lack of gore (not entirely absent -- still a few bloody, gloopy scenes) looked more like a result of not having a budget to create convincing effects beyond smearing some fake blood on a window and having a little blood dripping from a mouth.

You never see most of the scenes in the movie:  it's literally all phoned in, with three people in the radio station reacting to what they're hearing in the phone calls.  Then there's a zany doctor with a silly accent -- kind of like a Van Helsing character -- who conveniently shows up at the radio station to theorize what's happening for the surviving radio station employees and the audience watching the film.

People who shun zombie films because they usually draw their entertainment value from graphic devouring of victims and colorful destruction of zombies should consider this suspenseful gem, which generates more excitement from the voice of an alarmed reporter in the field, talking over the phone to a broadcaster, than hundreds of silly chompings and headshots in typical zombie fare.

So we get descriptions of the madness and a sense of dread and confusion that the people there are feeling; but we don't see the 'crazies' etc until they overrun the station. There is some blood in a few scenes and those scenes are done as good as any high budget movie could do, and the movie is intelligent and well acted by everyone involved, remember that this is  a lowbudget flick made in french ""canada' and they do make a decent little flick.

Also, given that the entire movie was shot on essentially one set I have to give kudos tot he director and crew. It was shot well, lit well and the color scheme was good. It was directed well to the point of not letting the single set bore the viewer.

The Bad Stuff: As cool an idea as the story is, they don't quite pull it off. The concept is so ""out there"" that they needed to build it up with clues in the first act. They don't. And as a result, when the whole reason for what is happening is dumped in the audience's lap, it's so weird it just seems to come out of left field. No one would come up with the idea without putting together pieces of a puzzle that aren't provided. Because of this, when our heroes try to figure a way out of the mess it seems nonsensical because they are trying to do so without the necessary information.

As this is a Canadian production, and there are numerous references concerning the rub between the English and French Canadians, there might be vital information here that I simply don't get because I don't know the subtleties of the situation.

Everything about the film is top-notch, especially the acting and cinematography. I recommend to those looking for something fresh, original, bizarre, and most importantly: substance over style. The story is what matters here. There is almost no blood, not even much violence. Most of the action takes place through outside reports, but it's all so tense and nerve-racking that you'll find yourself not caring that you can't see the action. I watched this film with three other people, and all of them were dead silent for almost all of the film's running time, completely focused and sitting on the edge of their seats.
  If there is one thing I MUST point out, it's that this film is not about zombies. Those looking for a movie about zombies could potentially be sorely disappointed. The fact that a quote from a critic, on the very packaging of the DVD, claims that Pontypool is ""one of the 25 best zombie movies of all time"" enrages me. Define zombies. Zombies= the living dead. The people in this movie are not corpses. They have not been brought back from death. They are infected by a virus.

Grant Mazzy (played brilliantly by Stephen McHattie) is a jaded old radio DJ who starts his day like any other but ends up reporting on a series of terrifying events. Through the use of long descriptive dialogue from remote reporters and phone-ins, the movie quickly loads itself with non-visual ""implied horror"" and the tension this creates is astounding. In theory, you could pretty much listen to this without a picture, like a radio play, and get the same effect. It's basically a filmed radio play, but a very good one. At least, for a while.

The first half of the movie was spellbinding, toe-curling and completely brilliant. We're left wondering what the hell is going on, just like the characters in the radio station, and a creeping fear lingers in the atmosphere. But then, roughly half way through, a Dr Mendez turns up and the movie takes a wrong turn and crashes into a brick wall. In Dr Mendez we get a ludicrous and highly illogical reason for the madness, and no matter how wildly I allow my imagination to stretch, I just cannot buy into the theory - or the so-called ""cure"" that comes later. It is tragic beyond words that a movie which was playing so perfectly, orchestrating such a gorgeous and thrilling tension, simply lost it all in one lousy narrative moment, and it never recovers from there.

All over the web fans and critics alike are praising this movie for its smart originality and boldness, so maybe I just didn't get it (but nor did the people I was watching it with). Yes - it is certainly original. But at what cost? Is originality always worth it? In this case, I'd argue. I would still recommend it purely on the strength of the first half of the movie, which really is an astonishing piece of filmmaking, but be prepared for a plot twist so strange and ""out there"" that it may leave you as bewildered as I currently am.

Certainly, the strangeness of the movie make the situational horror manifest itself within the confines of several interpretations.

It should be said that the ENTIRE movie takes place inside a radio station (or recording studio).  This means if you don't particularly care for the setting, you don't have a choice but to deal with it.

Did I like the setting?  It's alright.  It DOES give off a claustrophobic feeling which makes the atmosphere and storytelling a cut above the rest.  It's especially good for a zombie flick since it gives off the feeling of being completely trapped and blocked in with nowhere to go.

The fact that the first half of the film is devoted entirely to a group of radio broadcasters constantly trying to figure out what's going on by communicating with people and trying to get answers *did* initially have potential, but you know, after 45 minutes and STILL no interesting conversations taking place, this ends up really damaging the potential this film might have had.

After a while I was beginning to wonder if any actual suspense would even develop or if the movie writers were going for a cheap gimmick and not actually showing any zombie encounters.  Hey, this definitely crossed my mind several times.

The acting is also hard to forgive.  It's definitely average at best, and I don't care how original people think the storyline is- it's no excuse for subpar acting skills.

Eventually however, Pontypool does improve as the zombies make their presence known.

I will give the film credit for a few things- it does develop into a decent atmosphere during the second half, there was a bit of originality pertaining to the possibility of zombies being able to read lips, and the ending is pretty good.  I don't know what the popular consensus is over the ending, but I liked it.

I guess the segments dealing with the signs that people were beginning to change into zombies was a nice example of good writing as well.  The people would begin to stutter and repeat the same words over and over in addition to being somewhat forgetful, which would make everyone nervous because they knew what was about to happen to them.  This reminds me of nightmares I've had in the past, so this was some enjoyable writing.

I'll be thinking about what this film is about for some weeks---wow. I realize this is not helpful.  OK, let me say this: there are no predictable horror genre conventions that prepare you for what this movie is about---it doesn't fit convention.  It draws on convention, but then dumps you into a world of utter confusion.  By the film's end, just when you think you've figured it out, the rug is pulled out from under you.

The film thrives on suspense, and never lets up.  If you're easily annoyed by not knowing what's going on--then you'll hate this. But the terror the film creates is about not knowing what's going on---you experience the same disorientation as the films characters.

The acting is superb.

That is a VERY loose basis for this movie admittedly but where the story goes from there is just as pointless and painful.

Yes, we've seen it all before in the two versions of 'The Thing' and countless isolated zombie incidents that pop up in endless living dead variations , but McDonald makes it all seem fresh and new.

Grant Mazzy (Stepen McHattie)  DJ
Sydney (Lisa Houle) Station manager
Laurel (Georgina Reilly) Switchboard technician

The three employees are all working one fateful day when they start getting some strange calls.  Apparently some violent mobs have been wrecking havoc in town.  Panic slowly sets in as the questions and danger escalates.

This movie gets an A+ for character development.  All three members of the cast are very convincing in their roles.  But just what the hell is going on?  Is this some elaborate hoax?  More disturbing calls come in as the tension reaches its breaking point.  There are no televisions at this isolated station to confirm any suspicions.

It soon becomes evident that there is some sort of infection outbreak through town, apparently spreading through the English language.  Say the wrong thing, it might cost you your life.

That does sound pretty preposterous, but the story is executed extremely well.  The station is stuck with quite a dilemma--try to spread the word of warning or risk magnifying the problem.

This movie obviously has something to say.  Big thumbs up for that.  The developments are not very cut and dried, but overall it is very thought-provoking.  I totally appreciate the efforts, but I think this film might just be too smart for its own good.  Pontypool gets a little bogged down within its own mystery.  Too talky, not enough action or bloody kills.  You gorehounds might be disappointed.  I think this was a great idea that never quite reaches its potential.

3967565,3,B002QH4R54,"This film was listed as a possible best horror films of the past year by many though it usually fell short and was listed as honorable mention instead (since there were a fairly good number of such genre films this year).  So when I saw it I picked it up and decided to give it a try.  The box cover itself had a critic state it was one of the top 25 best zombie films of all time which fueled the promise it had.

The film's premise is of a small town near Hamilton, Ontario and not all that far from Quebec, Canada.  It takes place almost entirely in the office of a radio station.  The main character is Grant Mazzy, the talk show host for radio 660.  His show is one of those mix of news, some humor, politics, things like that and he is in the building with his producer, a woman named Sydney, and Laurel-Anne, a young Afghan veteran who is the jack-of-all-trades employee (almost like an intern).  During the course of the film, Ken Loney, the traffic guy in the ""sunshine chopper"" but actually just driving around seeing traffic calls in and starts explaining that large numbers of people are surrounding a Dr. Mendez's office chanting the same word over and over.  At first, this seems something to do with Mendez and an illegal prescription scam and so it could be just protesters, etc.

Though not a traditional zombie film (the undead walk the earth or possessed from voodoo), we soon think more on the lines of Stephen King's novel Cell or the English films 28 Days Later and its sequel.  Instead we have something resulting in a ""virus"" that may or may not travel through vocabulary and words.  And we soon find out maybe it is related to English rather than anything else (i.e. French).  The setting up of this works really well.  There are a few early bizarre happenings from an encounter at a stop sign to a guest for the show suddenly acting bizarre with an almost obsessive-compulsive disorder with speech.  And the call ins from Ken Loney are very suspenseful.

This film based off its setup (almost like a play and has been written as a play too) will turn a lot of folks off, so it isn't a film for everyone.  But to me, this isn't its weakness at all.  The weakness comes more from the various expositions that happen to explain what is going on (specifically by the Mendez character) and the much too quick understanding of what may or may not be happening.  Also the behaviors and actions during parts of the set pieces are a bit too suspension-of-disbelief; with the ""infection"" of one of the main characters and the behavior of the others to him/her.  My first reaction would have been to help (since there was no immediate danger) but instead there is almost an indifference or aloofness.  And the end came way too quickly where one is left wondering who was infected and who wasn't and if those that were not infected, then why would the survival instinct quit with them especially when Quebec soldiers were apparently very close to the rescue.  And of course, the ""science"" of the ""virus"" is preposterous.

After the end of the credits, there is an odd little piece which puts the film more into the Arthouse crowd and was somewhat unfortunate since it makes one just roll their eyes.  And I'm sure there is various political and social commentaries in here but that's for you to really search out (i.e. an Afghan vet and what's that mean, English Canada versus French Canada, the fright of change versus actual love, white Canada and its opinion of recent immigrants (Arab, Hispanic, maybe the Asian subcontinent, etc.))

Anyways, the film is pretty good.  Probably 3 1/2 stars, weaknesses or not.  It is very suspenseful and works well when it is not doing its silly exposition.  The main characters are bit of the pompous type which is more of a statement for its ""arthouse"" feel, its author, and its director, than more than its story.  I'd still recommend it and definately would give it a thumbs up.  I just wish the main characters were more likeable, the pretentiousness was absent (the author of the story even tries to claim they are not zombies but ""conversationalists""), and the science and exposition worked better.  Having no understanding of what was going on would have made a better story than a half understanding.  Enjoy.",1265328000,7,4269,4.607142857142857

8377784,1,B002QH4R54,"Neither my husband nor I were impressed with this movie AT ALL. I'm not the world's biggest zombie movie fan, but I'd heard over and over again that this wasn't ""your typical zombie movie."" So, unfortunately, I had very high hopes for it due to the good reviews and the fact that we -do- both like horror and suspense. The first half seemed good, though extremely slow. By the time any real action occurred, over half of the movie was over. When the action DID occur, it was all confined to the outside of the radio station. The very few ""scares"" there were all occurred  OUTSIDE of the station. You could only hear, not see, what was going on. I found this to easily be the most annoying aspect of the film. It could have been really good, but the following all detracted from the film:

 Most of the events that were supposed to scare us take place outside of the immediate viewing area (radio station). Why? Wouldn't it have been a lot scarier if we could actually SEE these events? I for one, did not find it more scary to only hear them as opposed to seeing them - if that is what the film was trying to accomplish.

 VERY LITTLE actual action. What action there was, was confined to the last 20 or so minutes of the film.

 The radio DJ, Mazzy Grant, talked me to death. I was bored the entire time. I wanted to watch a movie, not listen to a DJ talk endlessly about very little... but hey, there were lots of weather reports... (snore)

 The one actor I actually -liked- who played the part of Dr. Mendez, was given quite limited screen time. It would have been nicer to see more of him
...which leads me to my next point...

 With the exception of the Doctor and Laurel Ann, I thought the acting was very bad. I seem to be in the minority here, but I did not enjoy the acting, nor did my husband.

 I don't mind slow beginnings to horror films, so long as they deliver a punch at the end of the film. Pontypool did NOT deliver.

 It was a real stretch to believe a virus was being spread by WORDS. I can suspend belief so far but... that is just ridiculous. Even so, with the right producer, director, chain of events and so on, it could have been much better than it was. Really, none of the film was plausible, and even though it's horror and we know it's not real, I prefer movies that bring at least a little bit of realism to the table.

 Not even ONE of the ""events"" that took place scared me or even slightly thrilled me. The film was boring beyond belief. I could have slept through it.

 I agree with one reviewer who said, "" You don't have to watch this movie, all you have to do is listen, as there is nothing to see and not that much to visualize."" There is indeed very little to see in this film. And what one does see is confined to the last 20 minutes. We don't see but a flash of the zombie mob (maybe 5 or 10 seconds?). We see no real horror, other than Laurel Ann's demise.

 One of the most confusing things in the film to me was when Mazzy Grant looked under his desk in apparent horror (they really built the suspense factor here)... to find... NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. And there was no explanation as to what even freaked him out. This is the point at which I quit taking the movie seriously.

 I kept hearing that the movie had a ton of comedic moments, but we did not find anything really funny about the film (other than Dr. Mendez, but I am getting to that...)

 And finally... there is not one actual scare in the movie. At least not for me. People can talk about the film being ""intelligent,"" ""different than your average zombie film,"" and so on all they want, but what it comes down to for me is, there are NO scares here. NO thrills. And NO intelligence to be found, just gibberish. (By the way, I am not a person who needs gore in a film; in fact, just the opposite. I much prefer intelligent thriller-horror movies, but this was just not it.)

Perhaps the one redeeming quality, if there WERE any, was Doctor Mendez's sense of humor, which my husband and I did enjoy. But we saw so little of it, that it really doesn't make up for the rest of the film's negatives.

All in all, I'd rate this film a zero if i could. It's just that bad. I hope whoever is reading this review has a different experience. After all, we are all different and everyone enjoys different things. But for us, at least, it was lacking in everything that it promised: scares, thrills, and humor. I regret making the purchase. YMMV and I hope it does if you spend money on this film.",1508198400,,4499,4.25

On February 14, his drive into the station (in the basement of a church) is interrupted by a strange woman who bangs on his passenger window and seems to be mumbling strange words. Before he can get the window open, she vanishes into the show storm. At the station, it becomes clear he both doesn't like and doesn't understand the small town world he now inhabits. If that wasn't stressful enough, a report comes in of a mass gathering of people at a local doctor's office where they tear the place apart and weirdly chant semi-coherent words. His two female producers, Sydney and Laurel-Ann, try to verify the situation and keep Grant from going into shock jock mode. As reports come in from everywhere but official sources, the tension mounts--the mobs are described as tearing people apart and eating them. Is this really going on or is it some Orson Welles-style gag?

The movie stays in the radio station for the whole running time, giving it a claustrophobic feel and capitalizing on vagueness and uncertainty of the situation. The actors are believable and make the story compelling, helping to smooth over rough patches. As with many zombie movies, the technical explanation of how the zombies are created is very unconvincing. Unfortunately, that creation process is thematically central to the film so if viewers don't buy into it, the rest of the movie is hard to watch. I was willing to go along to see where it would end up but my immersion into the film dropped quite a bit. The zombies themselves do provide enough horror and tension to keep the story exciting. The ending relies a little too much on incoherence and confusion to be truly satisfying, though it certainly leaves a plenty of material for viewers to think about and discuss. This movie probably would reward multiple viewings and at ninety-three minutes is easy to rewatch. I will definitely give it another chance.",1486598400,,2041,4.798295454545454
