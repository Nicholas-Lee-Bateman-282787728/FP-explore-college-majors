1326420,5,B00003CXPV,"This is one of the few movies in recent memory where, at the end, I turned to my movie going companion and said ""Can we make them show it again!? Right now?!"".  Rush is amazing, Caine oozes slime and disdain, Winslet glows in her sexiest role to date, and Phoenix delivers a wondrous performance as the inncocent priest seduced by his own desires (with a little push from the Marquis, of course).  The film begins as a lush visual treat and decends quickly into madness and gore.  Not for the faint of heart (or the morally high-minded), this is a wonderful film that has made MY top 10 list.",984009600,3,592,4.412844036697248
1326421,2,B00003CXPV,"This film functions as an apology for Sade, just like many works of so-called ""literary"" value.  The problem is, when one has read many biographies and historical records of this transgressive novelist (as I have) one tends to become disdainful of any attempt to romanticize this man.
 First of all, there are still hundreds of documents from Sade's period, recorded by the police of his time, which point to the fact that he had been the perpetrator of horrendous acts of rape and sexual violence on prostitutes and working-class women. He was never penalized for these activities (he was a Marquis, they were peasants) until he performed these same acts upon a woman of more respected standing.
 Secondly, reading Sade's actual essays on his personal philosophy reveals a very sexist vision of the world: women are only fit to be used sexually by a male dominator. This belief lead him to kidnap and terrorize hundreds of women.
 Thirdly, the period of Sade's life in which Rush portrays him, is highly inaccurate. By all accounts, Sade was, at this point, overly obese and debauched; his days in the Bastille prior to the Jacobin revolution had lead him to gluttony while he worked on ""120 Days of Sodom"" (published post-mortem).  During his release from the Bastille and the subsequent French Terrors, Sade's death was actually ordered by Marat (when this revolutionry discovered who Sade was and why he was in prison), but Marat was assassinated before the sentence was carried out.
  Although Rush and Winslet performed their roles rather well, and the costumes and cinematography of the film were interesting, this film's attempt to romanticize Sade follows a tradition of literary dishonesty which ammounts to nothing more than revisionism.
 Sade is interesting as a deviant transgressive novelist who prefigured Freud's and Krafft-Ebbing's theories. Read the many accurate biographies about him or read his own works and you'll get a far more realistic picture than this film provides.",983923200,17,1994,5.113846153846154
1326422,4,B00003CXPV,"First of all, to watch a movie so boldly handling issues of freedom of
speech and self-expression by means of sexual freedom was extremely
refreshing (also knowing it has been nominated as the Best
Picture). As usual with film-makers interpreting history, corners are
rounded and contrasts are smoothed giving to M-s de Sade the air of
unnecessary martyrdom. M-s de Sade, who was quite a controversial
historical person, is represented as a forerunner of sexual revolution
(although, by no means he was the first to scribble and publish lewd
verses and obscene stories). However, as it's won't with a good movie,
it's not important, after all.
The plot, in a nutshell, is
inveigling: in a lunatic asylum M-s de Sade (J Rush) keeps producing
his sacrilegious and perverse stories (that would be considered mild
pornography today). A laundry maid (K Winslett), who also enjoys her
mind to be soiled, for a handsome pay smuggles them outside... The
administrator of the asylum - Abe (J Phoenix) is quite human and
progressive in methods of treating his patients: they paint
watercolors, perform plays, sing in a chorus. He also has to put up
with Sade's pranks. He is tormented between earthly attraction to the
maid and his call before God. Dr - a very French name - (M Caine) who
uses quite opposite methods of treatment (like flogging, the Iron Maid
and the drowning stool), arrives to the asylum to check on its
administration and on behavior of M-se de Sade. The latter becomes his
mortal enemy by sharpness of his tongue and indecent
assaults. Passions flare high with such characters and don't expect a
simple ending. As many reviewers have noted, the actors were splendid:
verbal duels between Rush and Phoenix, Phoenix and Winslett, Rush and
Winslett kept me glued to the screen in anticipation how this sinister
spectacle would culminate.
I'm also not the first to warn you that
if you're Puritan of moral and strict of mind, blush instantly hearing
f-words and alike, like simple stories and smiling chirping characters
- you'll abhor the movie provoking you with its violence and nudity. I
liked it very much, but I'll think twice before adding it to my home
collection - my mind kept me returning to some scenes again and again
and it left me disturbed, uneasy and moody.",983145600,,2281,4.866323907455013
1326423,3,B00003CXPV,"Any repressive government is based on a network of power that runs from the head to the lowliest serf.  The Marquis de Sade's principal subversion was to obvious alternative networks of naysaying, the body attacking the body politic, whether in the dissemination of his books, from cell to public, or in the creation of his art, from author to reader.  This latter, distorting pattern subverts De Sade's authority as an author as disturbingly as he did that of the ruling classes.
'Quills' offers a heritage movie closer to the Carry Ons, Jean Rollin and Walerian Borowczyk, exponents of 'lower' period dramas, than the conservative likes of Merchant Ivory; shabby, disintergrating, raucous.  Its didactism is less interesting than Kauffman recovering the style perfected in 'The Right Stuff', revelling in instability of modes, tones, forms, narratives.  The script, while containing much funny dialogue, runs out of steam, and Kate Winslet's part is too big for such a minor character, eventually capsizing the film.  The play put on for Royer-Collard is so shockingly marvellous, though, in its mixture of Artaud and pantomime, that one regrets theatre has generally stagnated.",982713600,,1180,5.32258064516129
1326424,5,B00003CXPV,"Quills is one of the best films of they year.  It's adapted by Doug Wright from his Obie Award winning play and directed by Phillip (Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Right Stuff, Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Kaufman.  It stars some of the best actors working in films today: Geoffrey Rush, Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix and Michael Caine.
It seems an odd time for a film which more or less romanticizes the last days of Marquis de Sade to be filmed and released-yet here it is.  Although it's release is on a smaller city by city schedule, you'll probably want to make a point of seeing it in the theater.
Words are powerful things.  The pen is mightier than damn near anything and creates more fear and controversy than anything as well!!!  The pornographic and satirical writings of the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) are not only escaping from the Charenton Asylum  for the Insane where the aristocratic Marquis enjoys a great deal of creature comforts courtesy of a benevolent Abb Coumier (Joaquin Phoenix), but they are also being published and distributed throughout France, much to the embarrassment of Napoleon who at first wants de Sade shot but then reconsiders and dispatches the sadistic but morally superior Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine)to insure that de Sade's pornography is not seen by the public ever again. The Marquis' writings are leaving the asylum with the help of a laundress named Madeline (Kate Winslet) who's infatuated with de Sade's talent and in unrequited forbidden love with the Abbe'.  Thus, the main cast of characters has been introduced, and the play can now begin.
There's a somewhat overly tidy twist ending which though clever, wraps up everything so neatly we're reminded this has been a stylish work of fiction.  Pity we are not given an ending to match the opening of the film in which we seem to be witnessing a sado-masochistic moment from within the Marquis de Sade's imagination only to realize we are watching a public beheading of a young woman.  There's a true feeling of  being surprised and unsettled at the beginning of the film.  Most will not leave the film unsettled or off-balanced however unless you want to really contemplate.
Geoffrey Rush has finally found his `role of a lifetime'.  At times perhaps you will see a bit of James Woods in Rush's performance.  But Rush goes beyond what I suspect Woods would be capable of doing.  He inhabits the immorality of his character like it was the skin he was born to stretch in.  One forgets we are witnessing a bravura performance.
The more observant will witness a remarkable subtle performance from Joaquin Phoenix which does pay off in a fiery confrontation scene late in the film.  It's not the kind of love it or laugh at it performance we got from him in Gladiator, but a much more textured and less affected performance.
Kate Winslet remains one of the most emotionally honest actresses of our time.  I can't think of another actress working today who is able to seem so effortless and natural and resist the temptation to become overly theatrical when on screen, yet still portray distinctive and powerful characters like Winslet does.  Her character wears a variety of masks, and the seemingly difficult task of playing someone like this in a natural, non-theatrical manner is handled perfectly by Winslet.  She refuses to chew the scenery even when several opportunities beg for her to do just that.  She's simply marvelous and has never been in a better film.
The film dazzles us in several ways.  First is the approach that Kauffman takes.  He is having his cake and eating it too, when he frames this vision of a Marquis de Sade as an 18th century martyr of freedom of thought and opinion.  A man who's pornographic, satirical and sacrilegious writings so influenced the world, he had to be locked away in an insane asylum and persecuted for his `art'.  Kaufman and Wright don't shy too far away from de Sade's words, or from suggesting that his words are powerful, influential, hypnotic and dangerous. These are words that are capable of causing people to act on their animalistic urges and perhaps these are words that will create anarchy if not muted.
Yet Kaufman and Wright can not really show us much of De Sade's work at all.  It would not get past today's censors and it would not be met by an audience with anything short of disgust.  Some of de Sade's writings are beyond gross and a mainstream audience would hardly be able to stomach some of the material.  We do hear snippets of what most would consider the sacrilege of his work, and it's shocking to see him spit on the bible and dismiss it so sharply - but these things are just the tip of an iceberg that the audience is spared from hearing or seeing.
Instead we get a pretty simple morality tale.  Rush's de Sade is so beyond anyone's idea of decency that he doesn't seem very much like a dangerous threat to society as much as a drag queen martyr for freedom of speech and thought.  The character of Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine)  is such a hypocrite, as an ultra conservative who uses his morality as an impenetrable shield, giving him carte blanche to cut with a sword without regard to how many he hurts in the process. He's a slimy villain minus only a few degrees of camp.  We are given almost cliched scenes of melodrama and sequences that could have come from any number of over-written bodice ripper type novels (where caged women yearn to be freed).  It's just here they are taken for a spin in a unique direction.  They have been partially re-invented to fit into a more acceptable tall tale telling of the Marquis de Sade's last days. Even the most obvious and cliched of conceits, Dr Royer-Collard's  teenaged wife Simone wanting to experiment sexually with a young contractor, after reading the Marquis de Sade, is acceptable because of the conviction of  Amelia Warner's performance coupled with a need for something a bit familiar, and overdone to hang onto and feel vastly superior to.
There is some strong stuff in the film and it's not for squeamish or the prudish. It almost goes far enough at times, and it's certainly understandable why it holds itself it back from going any further.
No secret that repression and censorship and prohibition breeds acts and behaviors which rebel against the oppression.  Here we have a film which tidily wraps the story of de Sade in 18th century  clothing, but is quietly shouting messages to all who care to take notice of them. The repression the Marquis endured undoubtedly fueled his sordid tales, and the careful way the film represses itself may make audience members imagine more than what they've really seen.
I loved it.  I enjoyed the deceptively tasty tone the script, actors and direction bring to the material which becomes a cousin to a Greek morality tale as re-thought by a modern Shakespeare, carefully presented for mass audience consumption..
Rather than be overly gross or pornographic the film gives us brilliantly conceived filmed scenes like when the Marquis ingeniously makes his clothing a parchment on which to write his latest story using his own blood as ink.  Or even better when he whispers his stories from in-mate to in-mate until they are finally copied down by the devoted laundress Madeline to be smuggled to the mysterious man on a black horse who will whisk them away to the publisher.
At the end, the film starts to explode into a bloody Spanish Inquisition inspired finale you always wanted to see in one of those Hammer (or Poe inspired)Roger Corman films, where a larger budget would let them show you more debauchery and bloodshed.  But it's then twisted into a too clever and too tidy of a finish.
The decadent look of the film must be credited to Rogier Stoffers' superbly crafted cinematography. He paints with light and film magically. There's also fine supporting work in the film by actors who portray other inmates suffering from various conditions of insanity.  Although at times the in-mates are  used as sort of comic relief, they remain quickly painted memorable portraits or characters, and not merely unimportant props.
There's great detail in the film which I savored with relish.  The frames were used sumptiously by the director and his cinematographer.  A few very memorable images will be replaying in my head for quite some time.
I know the film will disappoint some of you for compromising itself, and it will shock and offend some of you because of its material.  I also know it's one of the best films of the year.

The film presents the Marquis as a kind of 18th century equivalent of Larry Flynt--liberal ideas about a mans unlimited right to express himself are challenged by the disturbing nature of what he wishes to express.  This makes for a fascinating tension in the narrative as director Philip Kaufman and screenwriter Doug Wright deny the possibility of easy answers.  Certain scenes seem to grant the possibility that incendiary language can lead to horrendous real-world consequences, yet the Marquiss efforts to be heard are presented as heroic and the forces against him as villainous.  Perhaps the real damage is caused by a societys efforts to repress its darker impulses instead of giving them a healthier avenue of expression.

Michael Caine as the controller of the asylum is smooth and charming and deeply sinister, whereas Geoffrey Rush (as inmate De Sade) is lucid and repellent but arguably no more insane than his persecutor.

Kate Winslet, in one of her earliest roles, shows why she has since become the go-to actor for roles that require both intelligence and passion.

The effect is true to the essence of Marquis de Sade: his unstoppable compulsion and his affect on the social mores of those around him, in the culture at-large at the time, and to this day in the ""conflict"" between pure desire and ""proper"" behavior. The film is not pornographic, or pornographic for its own sake, using just enough to affirm the power of Sade's appeal and compulsion. Everything else aside, the gem of the film is the depiction of Sade's compulsive behavior: relentless, purposeful, never reflective, unstoppable under impossible circumstances. The film takes place in a mental hospital, where Sade has been confined by officialdom in the hope his volatile influence on French culture will be eliminated (and a progressive pastor/superintendent hopes he may be reformed). But he must write and publish his pornography. Sade will find a way despite every possible effort by the officials to remove any ability. Again and again, just when you think he can't possibly find a way, he does, an in ways that richly illustrate Sade's utter, devouring compulsion. The effect is powerful.

1326703,5,B00003CXPV,"This is one of my favorite movies. From the first few minutes of the film you're introduced to the characters who each have their own unique appeal. The story is about the Marquis de Sade who was a real life author in France. He writes adult novels that are usually contrived of sex and violence and quite often casts men of faith as his characters. He secretly writes them from behind the walls of a insane asylum and sneaks them out to a publisher with the aid of a chambermaid (who happens to be a fan of his stories). Though the content is taboo the country is smitten with his novels. Of course in the time of Napoleon, this is an unforgivable offense so the king sends a distinguished doctor to inspect the facility. The characters all well-rounded and engaging. Geoffrey Rush gives a magnetic performance as the Marquis. Everything about this movie is beautifully done. It should go without saying that this is a show not meant for children.

1326761,4,B00003CXPV,"I've read the Grove Press edition of the Marquis de Sade, to my regret (I wish I could forget parts of ""The 120 Days of Sodom"") and expected a Hollywood version of the Marquis would pat itself on the back for its forthright defiance of musty and repressive convention, without addressing what made him dangerous.  I needn't have worried; even twenty years ago, I saw all three volumes of the Grove Press De Sade on sale at the Tower Records store in Pasadena, California without their attracting the least notice from the teenage clientele (the Marquis' long-winded style and pseudo-philosophical digressions would have bored them before corrupting them); and contrary to the impression left by the trailers and reviews, the movie engages, bluntly, with De Sade's worldview in the opening scene: a libertine woman is guillotined, for the pleasure of her more jaded lover.  (And the entertainment of the crowd in the streets.)

If you can stomach this, I can recommend Doug Wright's excellent script, from his own play, and Philip Kaufman's inspired direction, which accomplishes much more toward contrasting intimate pleasures with public conventions than the wasted opportunity that was ""Henry and June.""  Although far more pointed (the ""scientific"" approach to rehabilitating the mad here consists of devices one expects of De Sade's depraved aristocrats for purposes of torture), and florid with outrageous depictions and juxtapositions, Kaufman now calibrates them precisely for ironic effect, taking note of the unexpectedly more compassionate and enlightened Joaquin Phoenix's Abbe' in tolerating De Sade's writings for purposes of therapy, versus Michael Caine representing Napoleon's anxieties about the moral stability of the nation he rules as emperor, having once been a liberator.

The cast is superb, Kate Winslet convincingly dumbing herself down, as it were, as the lubricious asylum laundress smuggling out De Sade's manuscripts, enjoying their shock value while retaining dignity enough to refuse De Sade's advances, and Geoffrey Rush as the Marquis, imprisoned comfortably enough that he doesn't curb his tongue, or his quill, when Michael Caine as the new order of things comes around.

Only Pasolini's film ""Salo"" even begins to approach De Sade's writing on its own terms, while the Peter Brook/Royal Shakespeare Company film of ""Marat/Sade"" goes far in explicating his worldview in the context of historical events.  (And one is always entitled to ask, Must we burn Sade, a mere writer, when we tolerate so much actual cruelty and carnage with a shrug?) But this film is honest enough, and, with all its provocations and outrageousness, subtle in how it constructs them, to escape the charge of playing childishly with fire.  De Sade has not been exceeded in horror by anything in literature, although often surpassed in real life in our hate-filled, poorly-governed world.  His film does not insult the intelligence of those familiar with De Sade, as I had expected.  This bar seems low; but the film works on De Sade's terms -- those of his lived existence, if not of the mind-boggling, eye-crossing cruelty of his work -- as well as its own.  As long as we permit real savagery in our names, or in anyone else's, out of some vague notion of Necessity or Inevitability, we are in no position to deny Necessity or Inevitability to the human imagination; which, for De Sade as well as for 99.99% of the human race, has always substituted for action.",1408060800,3,3471,5.158362989323844

The Marquis de Sade is a sexual deviant who keeps writing perverse prose. He uses the chambermaid Madeleine (Kate Winslet) to get that prose out to the publisher. The Abbe tries everything he can to get the Marquis to stop, but he simply won't do it. The Abbe takes all his liberties away, but the Marquis manages to find other ways of writing including using wine, his own blood, and eventually his own feces.

This movie was amazing. The acting was very good and the storyline was riveting. Geoffrey Rush has always been a favorite of mine, but after this, he moved to the very top. He was fantastic.

1326768,4,B00003CXPV,"Quills (Philip Kaufman, 2000)

Philip Kaufman is a high-stakes Thoroughbred. Whereas the blue-collar nags run every week or two year-round, you see the big-name guys maybe once every three months. Kaufman, with the exception of the seventies (when he doubled his usual output), has made exactly two movies per decade since his directorial career began a half-century ago. Most of them are well worth the wait, but every once in a while he turns in something, well, less so (think Twisted here), which is one of the reasons it sometimes takes me a very long while to get round to watching a Kaufman joint. Case in point: Quills, which I have now, finally, seen fourteen years after its release. And a very good one it is, though now loaded with all of the necessary hindsight, it is perhaps quite a bit more intriguing than it would have been had I seen it in 2000.

Loosely based on the last days of the life of thew Marqus de Sade, Quills gives us Sade (Shakespeare in Love's Geoffrey Rush) wheeling and dealing his way into being given writing implements and paper thanks to a progressive priest, the Abbe du Colmier (8MM's Joaquin Phoenix), who is willing to allow the Marquis a bit of what we would today call art therapy. Of course, he finds ways to get himself into increasing amounts of trouble with the asylum's upper management, largely with the help of Colmier and washerwoman Maddy LeClerc (Titanic's Kate Winslet). Ultimately, of course, there is a confrontation, and the head of the asylum (Michael Caine) starts going to greater and greater lengths to try and break Sade's will.

I'm never really sure what I'm going to get from a Geoffrey Rush movie. Sometimes you get The King's Speech, other times you get Mystery Men. It should be obvious by now that Quills is much farther along the left side of that sliding scale, at least in my estimation; Joaquin Phoenix, for all his antics (and all his showing up in movies like 8MM), is a very good actor when he turns his mind to it. Winslet, of course, brightens every corner she appears in, and the trio make for a winning combination. The obvious downside to this is how clean everything is. Every time I bring up this criticism in a movie it brings to mind Fulci's Zombi 2, the medical center's disgusting griminess that lends such an air of realism to pieces of that movie. You won't find anything like that here, either in the set decoration or the depictions of the characters. The battle of wills between Sade and the good doctor at times feels like an inspirational movie rather than a fight to the death. In other wordscould have been more than it is, most certainly, and without too much effort. But what we got is still well worth watching. *** ",1395446400,,2717,4.619047619047619

I wasn't sure what to expect though the trailer was ""provocative"" and ""enticing"" enough to pique my interest. What a delight this movie was; with a writer acted wonderfully by Geoffery Rush that is arguably insane in his obsessive need to actually pen his thoughts but also very much still an evocative writer by putting to paper by quill what the society is too prudent to discuss in polite circles. The movie is especially interesting as a commentary of the times and what was considered perverse. The deviant things written by Rush's characters while sometimes abhorrent were at least between adults but was so unaccepted he was deemed insane and locked up for it while on the flip side, the accepted perversion of having a bride that is ridiculously younger than oneself is being justifiably acted out by Michael Caine's character, the doctor (a character I loved to hate). There's also the Abbe played by Joaquin Phoenix who is a marvelous character because of his evolution through the course of the happenings in the asylum and possibly also because of the yoke of being the ""good priest"". I would definitely recommend this movie; as long as one is very willing and ready to be uncomfortable for the sake of good cinema.

1326788,5,B00003CXPV,"I was introduced to this film through a friend, fell in love instantly and it is now one of my favorite films. It's definitely over-the-top; absolutely flamboyant and ludicrous and will leave you wondering if it's really just a terrible film or if it's brilliance wrapped up in an unusual presentation. I've decided on the latter, and it's very simple why. Can't really speak of the filmmaker's intentions with absolute accuracy, but if you're familiar with the Marquis you might say the style was something of both a hat tip in his direction as well as a caricature of him. If you're looking for a historically accurate film this is not for you. It does draw from some fact and includes many actual quotes and other references from his writing, and some little-explained references about his life, but it also completely rewrites him as a person and fabricates quite a bit. It turns a libertine into a freedom fighter. Nonetheless, undoubtedly my favorite part about it all is that although there is a character that fills that traditional role of villain, if you take a moment to sort out the plot and characters, you'll realize that there is no clear cut hero and no clear cut villain. Everybody plays a little of both, despite film being film, and having to have the traditional roles. A person who primarily watches blockbuster types and likes a tasteful, well cut story would probably turn away in disgust. But once again, anyone familiar with the Marquis will understand the sometimes obnoxious and overboard depictions of sexuality (although this is by no means a rival of pornography-for the most part, the most ""shocking"" depictions contain little to no nudity, although there is more nudity than you might expect to see in a 2000 film) Every liberty and artistic license was taken; it takes taboo to the next level in some areas. It drifts between dramatic and heartfelt, to genuinely funny, to sometimes corny and ""too much."" Plenty of it is downright offensive and there's a fair share of disgusting parts. And Geoffrey Rush, though by no means a physical counterpart for the Marquis, delivers the story in an unparalleled way. While definitely the star, most prominent characters and even some smaller screen-stealers all add to a very rich story that is anything but dull and will leave all of your senses positively overloaded. A person with no familiarity with the Marquis' style and who is looking for something ""inside the box,"" and who takes the film purely at face value would take little away from it. On the other hand, anyone looking for something unusual, outlandish, something that pushes every boundary possible in modern film and likes to mull over the more subtle points (with reward!) may very well cherish this.

1326966,5,B00003CXPV,"Unlike most of the reviewers, I don't believe that this movie is about freedom of expression versus religious or political oppression.  Ironically, de Sade would find it amusing that this argument even exists.  As a pretend revolutionary who was proud to be an aristocrat in a time when revolutionary thinking was equated with how many aristocratic heads you could lop off, de Sade spent his life dodging the bullets that contradictory viewpoints tend to bring. His work was designed for two purposes only: to see how far he could push his imagination into the dark regions of lust, and how far he could take others with him.  This movie perfectly expresses that, and does with brilliance, wit, and horror.",1338768000,,706,4.915966386554622
1326967,4,B00003CXPV,"I'm actually a huge fan of Marquis de Sade and I actually obsess over him as a person. He sure is an interesting person, besides the fact that he is a sexual deviant. And to most people, he just is a sexual freak. But I think he's a brilliant poet and a philosopher who chose to write on such subjects as sexual taboos and grotesque acts in sex. I also love his books, such as 120 Days of Sodom.

This film, however, is more of a dramatization of Marquis de Sade's life in prison. If you are looking for something REAL accurate, I'd stay away from this one. But as a film that is dramatized, it's actually quite entertaining and pretty good. Geoffrey Rush plays marvelously as Marquis de Sade in this dramatized adaption. And I say dramatize because this is what the film does. They did add drastic things such as the way he died and even something as small as his physique in his later years in his life. But if you are able to put that aside and actually try to enjoy a ""Hollywood"" version of Marquis de Sade, it's actually watchable. I would not call this film BRILLIANT, but it definitely is worth a watch. And again I emphasize ""HOLLYWOOD"" because you will not see anything philosophical or deep like an art film, but rather more of a period piece for pure entertainment. ""Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom"" by Pier Paolo Pasolini is a better example of an ""art film"" relating him and his writing. So if you are gearing more towards that, I highly suggest you check out Salo by Pasolini.

Quills on the other hand is an exaggerated biopic of de Sade, but fairly fun to watch. And for a HOLLYWOOD film, this wasn't as atrocious as I thought it was going to be. I saw the cast and crew and I wasn't really excited who's in it, besides Geoffrey Rush, but this is not a bad take on de Sade's life. Like I said, this film is purely for entertainment. So keep that in mind before you watch this film for any Marquis de Sade fans out there who are hesitant to watch this film.",1338508800,,1971,4.267379679144385

1326971,5,B00003CXPV,"The word ""sadistic"" being based upon the writings of the Marquis de Sade, isn't the point.  The point is that the brutality of the warden of the insane asylum (Michael Caine) and the angst of animus deliberately heaved by a priest (Joaquin Phoenix) upon the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) is at least as repelling as anything the main character is accused of.  We find a worker (the delightful Kate Winslet) in the asylum entertained by the sadistic writings (as secretly also was the majority of France in general).  Yet as an effort to censure the profitable indulgent writings of a allegedly twisted mind from a man with an obsessive predilection toward hypergraphia disorder, Napoleon Bonaparte orders the Marquis de Sade not only imprisoned but ultimately sequestered into an asylum where he is grotesquely abused and psychologically purged at any cost, to any limit.  In the end, the disorder conquers against all odds.
Brilliantly portrayed by consummate professionals in this film; perhaps what is most chilling is how we knew in our own hearts that the warden and the priest couldn't help but admire the indomitable Marquis de Sade.  But it is the sets and costumes that bring this story to believable real life in the film, and convincingly entertains the viewer.  I should add however, that if you are easily offended by sexuality, brutality, vulgarity, or resistance against the moral compass, then what the heck are you doing considering viewing this for anyway?  It is the biggest argument in history for freedom of speech that ever could be made.  This film hardly intends to present the subject material in any politically correct way, so beware or find something else to do.  Good grief.

There were some scenes, however, that felt to me, close to blasphemy.

The dialogue: THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD IN A MOVIE (there were parts where I wanted to rewind and listen to them again). Some lines of the dialogue bordered on the religiously unforgivable, but rang with piercing truth and human vulnerability.

These characters go from an uncomfortable state in the beginning, and then plunge to a depth that will leave you wanting to crawl away, but you won't be able to crawl fast enough because you'll be hypnotized.

1326974,5,B00003CXPV,"One of my favorite films of all time is 1967's `Marat/Sade'.  I don't really have anywhere that I'm going with that.  I mean, I mention it because this film deals with similar subject matter (the exploits of the Marquis de Sade to be specific), but that's really the end of their similarities.  Both are great films, but `Marat/Sade' is basically genius.  `Quills' isn't quite at THAT level.

Still, a total `A' film as far as I am concerned.

The first time I saw `Quills' I was, well, younger, and it was so shocking to me.  I was completely enthralled in every frame, no matter how absurd and disturbing.  Still, to this very day, this movie shocks me.  The whole feel of the film is intoxicatingly obscene, carrying with it an almost tacky existence yet it is so earnest and so dedicated that nothing here appears even remotely cheesy.  Every line uttered (and there are some very explicitly enticing lines) is uttered in a way that screams seriousness.

Locked away in France's Charenton Asylum, Sade continues to influence and exploit, refusing to be silenced despite efforts to do so.  When he wraps his sensually compulsive talons around a navely curious laundress named Madeleine, there is only one way in which this burning building can fall.

Down.

The finale is utterly chaotic and ultimately so unsettling (from the severed tongue to the fantasies of a `man of god') that it instantly becomes unforgettable.  `Quills' has one of the most haunting conclusions of any film this past decade, one I will always remember and applaud (it should have been all sorts of wrong, but abrasive direction and dedicated performances help craft a finale that breathes utter perfection).

The acting is a major highlight here.  Sure, the direction is impeccable (there is a beautiful claustrophobic air that weaves its way through each strangely seductive scene) and the script is remarkably crafted, but it is the three central performances that really elevate this film.  Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix and Geoffrey Rush chew up each and every scene with ravenous intensity.  Rush has been labeled `hammy' for this performance, but there is no denying that he nailed it in my opinion.  This character (especially in this light) needed a layer of controlled chaos, and Rush completely understood that.  Phoenix was sadly nominated for the wrong performance in 2000.  Sure, he was pretty good in `Gladiator' (although recent viewings have left me with the sour taste of `camp') but he is phenomenal in `Quills'.  The way he underscores his characters own sins with the sharp mark of propriety is beautifully restrained and honest.  And then there is Winslet, the definition of brilliance on screen.  Her development of this woman is outstanding.  The way she sinks into every word uttered by Sade, allowing his very tongue to guide her curiosity; it's just effortlessly captivating.  She crafts a woman coming into her own skin, complete with the perfect balance of seductive modesty.

`Quills' is not a film that any and everyone will enjoy.  It is abrasive and perverse, but it handles those qualities with a depth that allows for a feeling of poignancy.  A film that understands how to make trash, art, `Quills' is an unforgettable journey into the minds of the ugly.",1265673600,,3267,4.952205882352941

1326987,4,B00003CXPV,"What you get out of this idiosyncratic movie depends heavily, far more than in most movies, on what you bring to it. The Marquis himself and treatment of him will evoke any of many different feelings, depending on the viewer's background and beliefs. I choose not to touch on those feelings, except to say that Rush, Winslet, Phoenix, and all the rest did exceptional jobs in dealing with this complex character and setting.

I'm not forgetting Michael Caine, by the way. Instead, I single him out for special recognition. His rendering of the viciousness that de Sade's name attached to is outdone only by the genteel and brutal hypocrisy he brought to his character. Caine has done it before, when he created a startlingly similar character in an utterly different setting, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Statement/dp/B0001GOH7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Statement</a>. Perhaps, in Quills, the character has slightly more awareness of his own dark nature. Outside of that, I find the characters nearly interchangeable.

Given the character it describes and the state of mental health care in the first years of the nineteenth century, many won't find this easy to watch. If you tolerate it, though, its musings on just which lunatics are running the asylum might lead you analogies in many parts of today's society.

1326991,3,B00003CXPV,"This is a good, thought not great, movie.  I was rather disappointed in its simplifying of the life of Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade, aka the Marquis de Sade, into a rather boring, staid debate on free speech and its limits (or whether it should have any limits).  Contrary to popular belief, de Sade was a much more complex figure than people give him credit for.  While he was an indulgent libertine for most of his life, when he decided to start writing (at a comparitively late age), he threw himself into it totally and wrote some of the most startling and terrifying literature ever written.  He was a great writer, though an incredibly bleak, twisted one.  This film just seems to concentrate on the usual ""individual freedom vs. the state"" stuff, along with ""artistic freedom"", and honestly, it's boring.  It's almost like they tried to sugarcoat de Sade, which is not the thing to do with him.  Not to mention de Sade did not die like he did in this film.  Nothing like that.  De Sade died rather quietly, not chewing on a rosary while in the arms of the inquistor (Michael Caine's character).

The film is very well shot, with excellent performances by all, especially Geoffrey Rush as de Sade and Michael Caine as his main tormentor.  It's directed by Philip Kaufman, a very underrated director who has made many extraordinary films (Henry and June and The Right Stuff for example).  This is not an abysmal film, but it's nowhere what it shoudl be.  It's a tame biography of one of the most notorious (yet brilliant) writers ever to be seen by humanity.  Being a student of de Sade, I have to take exception with the rather simplistic way this story was rendered, and honestly, Kaufman should have known better.",1221609600,4,1727,4.675496688741722
1326992,4,B00003CXPV,"The Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) is locked in an insane asylum because of his casual treatment of erotic phrases.

In comes Madeleine LeClerc (Kate Winslet), a laundress with an appetite for dirty novels. In spite of her interests, she remains pure and attracts the eyes of many of the inmates. The town is in a fury over the Marquis' graphic descriptions of the forbidden and sometimes blasphemous acts, so Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) comes to the asylum to remedy the situation. However, the doctor's methods are much less humane than the Abbe's.

An excellent commentary on hidden desires and supression, Quills is a memorable historical film. Unlike the public's assumptions about the behaviors of people in the past, permiscuity existed hundreds of years ago, and this film does a fine job of describing why even now, we believe differently. Quills is no picnic, and as the name implies is often uncomfortable, but it is powerful.

Kate Winslet at her sexiest, her charimsa is easily shown in screen, she was just plain gorgeous, probably one of her best performences ever. Billie Whitelaw, as most are familiar with her as a charismatic actress, delivers a good performence even though her appearence was very brief. Last but not the least, Michael Caine who potrayed the 'Doctor' really well, his performence is beyond words. Almost everyone delivers a worthy performence. I have always been fascinated by movies potraying the 18th Century, ""Quills"" is erotc, steamy, a little disturbing, nevertheless, wildly entertaining if you appreciate the film more of an Entertainment and less of a Historical Biography of 'Da Sade'.

Several of the characters that play a major role in Sade's life in this film really did exist, and they really did play a major role in Sade's life.  Of course, there is quite a bit of dramatization, and fictionalization in this film, as well as characters who did not really exist, so as to make an entertaining story for viewers.  However, there was enough truth added to the story to remain faithful to the legacy of the Marquis de Sade.  For a more biographical depiction of Sade, one should read one of the several biographies that are out there. (I read ""At Home with the Marquis de Sade: A Life"" by Francine Du Plessix Gray).  After reading a Marquis de Sade biography, one can piece together the fact and fiction about Marquis de Sade depicted in this film.  For the casual viewer, this film is enough to get a decent picture as to who Sade was and what he was like, as well as see an entertaining movie.  For those who are more interested in knowing more about this man who was so controversial in his day, Quills is an excellent place to start: not only is it a very good film, but it gives the viewer a taste of the essence of Sade, before going on to read one of the Sade biographies for more in depth knowledge about this man.",1215734400,,1448,4.376865671641791

If you know nothing of Marquis De Sade, then you will have no problem with the fictionalized historical aspects of this movie.

I've read some of DeSade, and well what may have been considered scandalous in his time, you pretty much see on cable teevee every 10 minutes.

1327060,4,B00003CXPV,"Donatien Alphonse-Francois de Sade did not have his wicked tongue cut out -nor did he commit suicide by ingesting an Abbe's rosary. These incidents are the result of playwright Doug Wright's ""artistic license"", as he wrote the screenplay, giving us an intense historical drama that could be said to ""be based on actual events"". The swarthy and histrionic goings on of the plot was often performed by characters based on actual people, but so was BILLY THE KID VS. DRACULA (1966). Later Wright won a Pulitzer Prize for his play, I AM MY OWN WIFE. In QUILLS when De Sade's prose is read aloud several times, it is actually Wright's words, not the Marquis'.

Director Philip Kaufman, a writer that directs, has only given us 14 films since 1965. Two other controversial films having an erotic nature were THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING (1988), and HENRY AND JUNE (1990). To his credit, with QUILLS, even though it is based on a play, we never feel the normal claustrophobic and pedantic responses that adapted plays have given us in the past. The asylum at Charenton became a real place, and the action flowed interestingly. He edited the film tightly, and kept the pace up, leading us cleverly from one plot twist to the next.

In this tale the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) has been a ""guest"" at Charenton for several years, living a luxurious lifestyle in a suite of cells, surrounded by books, wines, and good food, and allowed to continue with his writing. It was all paid for with a ""letter de cachet"" set up by his wife, Renee (Jane Menelaus -the actual spouse of Geoffrey Rush). An empathetic fetching chambermaid, Madeleine, (Kate Winslet) smuggled out his manuscripts and delivered them to a publisher's representative. He was befriended by the handsome asylum director, Abbe du Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), and he is allowed to direct fellow inmates in theatrical plays as therapy; and they become popular to attend with the aristocracy. Monarch Napoleon becomes ""appalled"" at the libertine eroticism of De Sade's provocative prose. He bans the books, which guarantees their financial success with underground presses, and he sent in a callous completely sadistic administrative hatchet man, Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine). After De Sade publicly humiliated Royer-Collard with an erotic and violent play barely masking the real life situation of the good doctor, Collard has De Sades personal belongings confiscated and removed from his cell, including his ink and quills, leaving it even more barren than the others.

But De Sade would not be stopped, feeling that his writing, and the artistic freedom allowing him to write, was worth being martyred for. To get his prose out to his readership, he wrote first in wine on his sheets. When that too was taken, he began to prick his fingers, and using his own blood, he wrote on his clothes. Stripped naked, beaten to a pulp, tortured, chained and censored, on the very day of his death, after his tongue had been cut out, he continued to write with his own feces, filling up the walls of his cell with his odiferous scribbling. Not having the visceral and emotional power of watching William Wallace being eviscerated as he screamed, ""Freedom!"" -still we are left with an image of an artist, a pariah, a political hot potato, lying naked chained  to the floor and walls, but somehow triumphant as he chose the actual time of his death committing suicide by swallowing the Abbe's rosary.

This film presented the Marquis de Sade truly as a martyr, destroyed by the thick arrogance and censorship of church and state. We found ourselves cheering him on, accepting him as a protagonist, watching him manipulate the mob and laugh into the vicious teeth of torture. Nothing could stop him from continuing to produce his writing, not even death; especially death. His prose, erotic and political, irrepressible and conventional, often well composed and refined continues to fascinate, to interest new generations of active minds. It lives on, and this will not be the last film to depict his life.",1192665600,,4056,4.95007342143906

Director Philip Kaufman has created a vision of madness and depravity that will initially stun the viewer, but will eventually sink into the inner recesses of the mind and have a lingering effect that makes one contemplate the question, ""who truly understands the verities of insanity and genius.

Basically a lot of people interpret the movie as a film about ""censorship"" and ""freedom of speech"" - - yet clearly, as the film plays out DeSade is portrayed not only as a madman (which many would agree) but as a madman who's writings were *clearly* dangerous to society.  Everytime he is read from, writes or even speaks, it is as if the devil has come down to earth... chaos breaks loose, fires erupt, and people are forcefully victimized from behind until he's made to shut up. - - Ultimately, DeSade's words destroys not only those he doesn't care about but those closest to him as well... and at the end, he learns a lesson, and everyone else who listened to his ""filth"" get their revenge too... In essence its a film about divine justice and how a person needs be be careful what they say lest their words come back to haunt them.  So how can this be called a statement about freedom of speech?  (If anything its a morality play about how words can come back to haunt people.)  - - In conclusion, though, the movie is not really a story about a martyr of free speech...  but rather an excellent play about a struggle of wills, as well as a tale of sin, repentence, punishment and love.... Taken as pure fiction, it is brilliant to that extent, but if framed as a tale of censorship and literary freedom, clearly God wins out in the end and Voltaire gets sent to hell.

Regarding the ending - - after the ""climax"" the film becomes a bit funny - - first intentionally, then unintentionally....  - - In fact, at times I wonder if the director had toyed with several different endings and decided to use them all... Cuckoo's Nest, Hitchcock, Erotic Fantasy, Irony... or how about something funny (bingo!)

As for the acting... it is intense...  Surprisingly, the Marquis himself is rarely seen during the first 17 minutes of the film... but appears as a shadowy figure...  When he finally does appear, Geoffrey Rush's gushes with the intensity and charisma one would have expected the DeSade would have exhibited.  There is no letdown and it is no surprize that he got an Academy for that role.

The dialogue at times can be funny and campy (be sure to have a pen on paper on hand as you watch and learn how to talk dirty with literary elegance) - - of course, this is a film about Western Literature's first and foremost intentionally distasteful writer/philosopher - - the man who turned scandal into high art.  - - and one who's mind as profound and imaginitive as it was... filthy - - however, while the libertine life is not totally overlooked, the film is about far more than this...  and most of the more graphic portrayals in the film come across as satire moreso than erotica.

As a footnote, the genuine British accents really let you know you're in 18th century France !

1327096,5,B00003CXPV,"Philip Kaufman's ""Quills"" benefits from one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled for a ""period piece.""  A summary of the plot explains why actors flocked to the production:  the infamous Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) is imprisoned in an insane asylum and uses his charms on his keeper, Abbe (Joaquin Phoenix), and his laundress, Madeline (Kate Winslet) to have his debauched writings published and staged . . . but what happens when an enraged Napoleon sends his prince of darkness, Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to put a stop to the Marquis's writings?  Kaufman uses this ingenious plot, based on a play by Doug Wright (and adapted by Wright as well), to explore the clash between artistic license and repression.

Rush has the most fun, hamming it up as the gleefully profane Marquis - think of him as an even more perverted version of the Mozart in ""Amadeus,"" only without musical talent.  Rush stays just on this side of chewing the scenery, and he moves from charming to slashingly caustic in a split second.  That he charms both the Abbe and Madeline is no surprise.

His motives are not complex - the Marquis serves nobody but himself.  He recognizes the benevolent naivete of the Abbe and manipulates it, and he identifies Madeline's artistic soul mired in her laundress social station.  Both of them know better, but blast it, they can't help but adore the Marquis as a harmless, charming, if occasionally frustrating project.

Napoleon, however, wants his new France to be a noble place, with the pestilence of the prior regime washed away by the blood from the guillotine.  He is offended by the Marquis' profane novels, and sends the good doctor to ""cure"" the Marquis.  The doctor's methods are, without embellishment, sheer torture.  This is not Michael Caine's most enjoyable or best performance, and indeed the role is basically thankless.  But Caine can do things that no other actor can, and his ""proper fury"" is a wonder to behold.

""Quills,"" as one can imagine, is a dark movie that descends, bodily fluid by bodily secretion, into the deepest recesses of despair and hatred.  But it is also imbued with a dark humor, and there are a surprising number of laugh-out-loud moments.

What is most refreshing is that Rush and Kaufman do not make the Marquis into a saint.  He truly is a despicable character, but the story shows that even the most wasted being can have some value - even if Michael Caine's performance casts that proposition into doubt.  I was fully prepared for the Marquis to be portrayed as another pure artist condemned unfairly by a repressed system, but ""Quills"" is too complex and intelligent for that - even though it surely contains some of those elements.

""Quills"" is also a beautiful film, which one may not expect from a movie set largely in an 18th-century lunatic bin.  From lush visuals to the seductive purr of Rush's voice-overs, ""Quills"" offers seductions for both the eye and the ear.

Long story short, ""Quills"" is one of the best films of the year.",1160524800,,3012,4.830409356725146
1327097,4,B00003CXPV,"""Quills"" is the loosely adapted story of the latter part of the life of the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush), a French writer and aristocrat infamous for his shockingly pornographic works, and who was kept in an asylum for the insane at Charenton for nearly three decades. The patients at Charenton are tended by the young and kindly Abbe du Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), who encourages them to use artistic outlets such as painting, theater, and writing, as therapy for their various conditions. Unbeknownst to Coulmier, however, de Sade has been smuggling his stories out of the asylum via a fascinated laundry maid, Madeleine (Kate Winslet). When de Sade's novel ""Justine"" is published, the infuriated Emperor Napoleon sends a new man to oversee Coulmier's work. Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine), in stark contrast to Coulmier's kindly approach, believes torture is the best sort of treatment. Under his sadistic rule, things at Charenton begin to unravel in the most sinister of ways.

The movie has been criticized for being a much too loose interpretation of history, and normally I'm an ardent advocate of historical accuracy myself (and I will not argue with the fact that the film does indeed skew and reconstruct many aspects of the real Marquis de Sade's life and character), but in this case I think it is worth pointing out that the writer never intended for this to be a biographical film. In one of the bonus features available on the DVD, he comments that he merely heard of one incident in the Marquis' life and though it would make a great premise for a story. And I think that if only he'd given the characters fictionalized names as well, many of those that have criticized the film's failure to adhere to historical fact could agree that the story in itself here, if you look at it merely as a work of fiction, is a brilliant one.

This film offers us a hair-raising view of the psychological transformation of its characters. At the beginning, de Sade doesn't really seem insane at all. Eccentric and provocative, certainly, but not crazy. Ironically, it seems to be that the very things done in an attempt to ""cure"" him that end up driving him over the edge. At first the Abbe's attempts to stifle de Sade's writing are minimal. When admonishment doesn't work, Coulmier takes away his quills and ink. When de Sade finds other, increasingly creative but also increasingly disturbing, ways to continue writing, the Abbe is finally forced to take away all his possessions, including his clothes. Only then, when he no longer has any creative outlet whatsoever, do things truly start to darken. ""Haven't you seen a man naked before?"" he asks emptily as Madeleine looks on in a mixture of shock and pity. At this moment he is not only physically naked, but emotionally naked as well. Despair is the ultimate form of nakedness. From this point on events in the film spiral steadily and unstoppably downward, signaling a final descent into madness.

De Sade is not the only one who undergoes a transformation. In fact, Abbe Coulmier himself provides an even starker contrast in character between the beginning and the end of the film. In a way he reminds me of a male Alice in Wonderland, constantly trying to reason his way out of progressively more unreasonable situations. Ultimately, even his inherent naivete and goodness of heart cannot hold out, and he is himself consumed by the madness around him. I myself was shocked to see just how dark things get by the end of the story. The first two-thirds or so are almost light-hearted at times, certainly with some ironic humor. The final series of events, however, while thematically ingenious, are much more disturbing. This is a movie that will haunt me for years.

The entire cast is brilliant - one of the best matched groups of talented actors you could hope to find in one film. Rush, of course, steals the show as de Sade. I was already a fan based on his work in other films - ""Les Miserables,"" ""Elizabeth,"" ""Ned Kelly,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Munich"" - but I think this is the best performance I've seen him give yet. The rest of the cast, however, is equally talented. Joaquin Phoenix is an actor who never really grabbed my attention before ""Ladder 49"" and ""Walk the Line"" came out, but watching this movie, it is plain that even years ago he had quite an admirable amount of talent, and I've gained a whole new respect for his skill. And of course, Kate Winslet is as lovely and accomplished as ever. I cannot think of a single film - of the ones I've seen, including ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" etc. - in which her performance has not been superb. Finally, the leading quartet is rounded out by Michael Caine's chilling portrayal of Dr. Royer-Collard. As far as finding a capable cast goes, this film really hits the jackpot.

The DVD also offers some nice special features. The featurette ""Marquis on Marquee"" provides a very interesting look at the background of the story and its translation into film, while ""Creating Charenton"" and ""Dressing the Part"" look at the set and costuming respectively. In addition, there is commentary from screenwriter Doug Wright, a French audio track, and subtitles available in both English and Spanish. Overall it's a great DVD and a hauntingly well-done film, though it won't be a movie for everyone. Despite my view that in this case historical inaccuracies can be overlooked in favor of a brilliant story, some sticklers for realism will doubtlessly still be disappointed. And as I've alluded before, there are sequences in the film, especially the latter part, that are quite disturbing thematically (even with less actual gore than a lot of movies these days), so you should use your best discretion in deciding whether this is the type of movie for you. Only for these reasons do I knock off one star here. Otherwise I have nothing but praise for the film and recommend it highly.",1158019200,6,5968,4.829912023460411
1327098,4,B00003CXPV,"A very pleasant surprise, Quills, is a film that brings to the screen a fictitious story based on an unlikely character, who happens to be none other than the infamous Marquis de Sade.

The setting is Napoleonic France and Napoleon himself has decided to rehabilitate the county's most notorious mental patient, the Marquis de Sade, and prove to his people how able of a man/leader he really is.  Subsequently, he instructs France's most prestigious doctor to travel to the insane asylum and work side by side the resident abbey/director in bringing about their task, which in turn will prove to be rather difficult...

Joaquin Phoenix, Kate Winslet, Geoffrey Rush, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

There are the slightest hints of Silence of the Lambs and The Name of the Rose, which when watching the film will become evident.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

1327099,5,B00003CXPV,"well, well, well, this is a very impure tale indeed. Lets start off with the charcters. first we have of course the dirty writer the Marquis De Sade played by Geofery Rush (Javert in Les Miserable) who is in the Charaton Insane Asylum (where the whole movie is baed in). Next we have Madeleine 'Maddy' LeClerc played by Kate Winslet (Rose in Titanict) who is the launrdy lass and how one says......not Marquis's slave but his dilivery girl in other words he gives her the manuscritp and she would give them to the publisher's delivery man. For you see, since The Marquis was in the Insanse Asylum he couldn't go anywere and also he wrote NAUGHTY BOOKS and they weren't as Nopolain said ""Appropiet"", but I think he had his fare share of Marquis books. Next we have The Abbe du Coulmier who is payed by Joaquin Phoenix and he is the priest the insane asylum. And let me tell you like I said in my other review (Such a Naughty Little Film we Have Here) he is the HOTTEST PRIEST I EVER SAW. Last we have Dr. Royer-Collard who is played by Micheal Caine (Alfred in Batman Begins). Its ashame that he is such a good actor but doesn't get the best roles. His role in this movie was the doctor that treats the patients in the insane asylum. Also he marries a 14 year old girl. Then the word passes on and the Marquis De sade writes a play on it and a book called ""The Crimes Of Love"".

  Now moving on, the sets were fabulous and the costumes were the best. Let me tell you I have seen a lot of period peices but this one tops them all except for Amudaus. Now in this film the Marquis De Sade goes a little crazy because Abbe' takes away his  Quill and paper because they found out that he was piblishng behind there backs. So he goes a little crazy.

1327100,4,B00003CXPV,"I've watched two of the most recent adaptations of the Marquis' life on film - Quills (1999), Sade (2000) and I must admit that I'm quite torn between the two portrayals that invariably invites comparison, namely the roles of de Sade played out by Daniel Auteuil and Geoffery Rush respectively.

I've been exposed to the film Sade on an earlier date so I've to admit my bias to the character portrayed therein, which has since acquired my liking for and the film as a whole.

Both actors practically lived out their roles and it would be a mistake to assume that neither brought into their roles, traces of their own personalities and other characters they played in their other productions. Are we therefore to assume that we haven't a near-to-accurate portrayal of the infamous libertine and man of multi-talents?

Certainly not. For the 'true' portrayal of the Marquis may very well, lie on the cusps of the two - one dignified, deep and restrained, while the other - uncontainable, contemptuous and obscene. However they have more than one thing in common, commonly expressed through writing.

Sade is an important character, if not somewhat sidelined, in the historical movement of Continental Thought. Quills is a parody that examines the role of writing in our recent history. Writing, as it seems apparent from the story, is the medium between thought and action. Sade in Quills has an obsession to reify his thoughts in writing; from the psychiatric perspective, he is merely trying to release his obsessions through a writing compulsion. Not just intent on theorizing his philosophies - Sade's writings are practically depictions of action - writings that appeal to the primal desires of man with the intent to drive them into action. Prior to the advent of video pornography, Sade's writing was a potent force for pornography - his true legacy wasn't Sadism, but the fetish for the power of the written word. Meaning, as it seems, become highly dependent and guided by the signifier that has come to signify them. The text has come to shape and dominate our thoughts, actions and desires, becoming the real tyrant. Sade is but only one of the victims involved in the propagation of the hegemony of text. This reading would prove influential to Post-modern thought.

Back to the film itself. Rush struck terror with his menacing and irascible countenance - his bravura performance could hardly be detracted. Perhaps the only detraction was only in physical likeness - Sade was reportedly obese by the time of his final incarceration at Charenton and Rush look a tad emaciated. Sade ' la Rush revealed no white or graying but jet-black hair by the time of his demise at Charenton.

The set and costuming was impeccable, while the only remaining qualms I had was the casting. While Kate Winslet as Madeleine held a strong presence in the show, her maturity and confidence was unbelievable for a girl of 16. Phoenix's role as the Abb' seemed to be a deliberate miscast to facilitate the forbidden and repressed romance of the couple. His acting was at times, awkward and by far the weakest of the cast, though not without its better moments.

All in all the film is a testimony that period dramas have come pretty much a long way. Viewers wanting to indulge in a fair bit of a Theatre of Cruelty should not miss this cinematic masterpiece.",1148860800,,3346,4.859649122807017
1327121,4,B00003CXPV,"I must say I did not know much about the Marquis de Sade before watching this movie.  I knew of him, but was not familiar with his life.  The current DVD is a fictional depiction of his times that is based on a lot of fact.  The characters depicted in the film are historical, but the details of their lives have been fabricated for dramatic purposes.

Our friend the Marquis de Sade spent time in an insane asylum  by order of Napoleon (and this is a historical truth).  The present film explores what could have happened within the asylum.  The result is a rather unique movie;  at times it is very funny and at other times it is downright grotesque.

Like all good movies about insane asylums, this one has scenes that look to come straight out of Dante's INFERNO.  And, moreover, I would not recommend it to the squeamish of heart.  I admit there were a few scenes that even I found very difficult to watch.

The casting is impeccable;  Geoffrey Rush, Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix and Michael Caine are all terrific.  Much like he did with playing a pirate in PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN, it is obvious that Rush relishes his part as a man whose imagination and sex drive have both gone to warp speed!

If you like period movies, biographical movies or films that deal with the theme of where free speech comes to a head with the machinery of religion & politics, then this movie is for you!",1145059200,,1393,4.450592885375494

1327124,5,B00003CXPV,"A gorgeously shot, involving character study of the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush, who else?), although highly fictionalized, shows the conflict between free speech, art and the moral and religious values that still plague society today. The infamous writer, while imprisoned in the Charenton asylum in the early 1800s, smuggles his sexually free manuscripts with the help of a lovely, nubile laundry maiden, Madeline (Kate Winslet), out of the madhouse to publishers, so that all of France may indulge in its contents.

The Abbe (Joaquin Phoenix) who considers the Marquis a friend, and who loves Madeline with a passion, is torn, as he is a man of the cloth, bound by vows of chastity.

Things change for the worse when a conservative, middle-aged doctor, Royal-Collard (Michael Caine) is sent by the emperor to silence and repress de Sade. But the doctor proves to be a hypocritical tyrant, who resents the Marquis for freely expressing what he cannot achieve himself. Royal-Collard takes an orphaned, sixteen-year-old innocent girl named Simone (Amelia Warner, exquisite star of A&E's Lorna Doone)from a convent as his bride and makes her a sexual prisoner in a secluded ch'teau. The story takes a turn again as the Marquis refuses to be silenced, the Abbe and Madeline are unable to control their passion, and Simone rebels against her husband, purchasing the works of de Sade and discovering true pleasure and love with a handsome young architect (Stephen Moyer). She then escapes the ch'teau with her lover, leaving a taunting note for her husband, causing him to unleash his fury on the Marquis and inside the walls of Charenton, leading to tragic and chaotic results.

The casting of Jane Menelaus (real-life spouse of Rush) as de Sade's wife was pure genius; you feel that she still genuinely loves this man, despite his actions have had on her reputation.

The tragedy that befalls Madeline is one of the most tear-inducing moments in the film, and the grief of the Abbe and the Marquis painfully echoes within in the walls of the desolate madhouse.

An entertaining flick, with the conflicting perspectives regarding free speech.",1141171200,3,2142,5.073863636363637
1327125,5,B00003CXPV,"This is one of the most amazing period dramas I have ever seen. This film, supperbly acted by an all star cast, uses Doug Wrights brillantly play to create a movie unlike any mainstream America has ever seen. This play has all the makings or a period drama, but the issues that it discusses and the candor with which characters address it is is very modern, and very much the style of Sades writting. Wright has written a play that is extremly similar to one of Sade's own works of fiction. Though many may regard the subject as crude, this movie is intillectual and thought provoking. It is brought to life by one of the most amazing casts I have seen in a long time. Kate Winselt is superb as a virginal laundress who works in wards of the criminally insane. Her innnonce and curiosity is something a modern audience is easily able to identify with. Joaquin (sorry for spelling) Phoniex is amazing in this film as the idealistic priest who runs the asylum. I never realized his talent until seeing this film. The sexual tension between him and Kate Winslets character is incredibly realistic, and they have a kind of chemistry that is rarely seen on the screen. Geoffery Rush, the Marquis himself, is amazing in this film. The way he is able to capture the many facets of this character is incredible. Most films featuring the Marquis, portray him as a dangerous, lewd man (usually the bad guy). This film, with the help of Rush's amazing acting, is able to portray Sade as a man whom the audience agrees with, and almost identifies with. For once the Marquis is a victim. Micheal Caine is, of course, excellent as the sadistic Doctor. All of the supporting actors do an amazing job to complete this film. This film was a brave gesture, putting forth ideas that are not often addressed in commercial movies. It is one of the best films I have seen and i stronly reccomend it to anyone who is intrested in french history (particularly revolution), period dramas, Sade, insane asylums or just an intresting and throught provokinng flim.",1140998400,3,2036,4.642659279778393
1327126,4,B00003CXPV,"This film is very good entertainment at several levels. First, the acting of Geoffrey Rush, Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix, and Michael Caine is super. Second, the plot is convoluted and never really predictable while the script is witty and cerebral. Third, the underlying theme regarding the relationship of eroticism and the forces of repression is certainly relevant for any democratic society.

The Marquis de Sade, as played by Rush, is certainly not a very likable character, even if his sarcasm and wit propels much of the dialogue in the film. His eroticism seems somewhat dated in our day and age where we are bombarded with nudity. However, he reveals that the forces of repression in the state or in organized religion will attempt to repress the erotic, which lies very close to the center of man's existance. DeSade resists this repression as step by step his freedom of expression is removed and he responds with defiance. When deprived of ink and paper, he resorts to wine and sheets, then he resorts to blood on his clothing,and finally he resorts to feces on the wall.

DeSade is balanced against two forces; a beautiful young idealistic priest played by Joaquin Poenix and a sadistic alienanist, Dr. Royer-Collard, played by Michael Caine. Phoenix plays a priest who lives in a state of self denial about his own passions and thus is vulnerable. When deSade refuses to cooperate, it is the loving priest who begins the frustrating process of removing one after another of his expressive outlets. However, in the same way that the priest can not repress deSade's self expression, the priest can not repress his own desires for Kate Winslet.

Michale Caine's character is far more intact than is the priest. He is a sadist in his own right, torturing mental patients with all manner of devices. He appears to be vulnerable, like the priest, to his own inner sexual erotic demons. The doctor takes a virgin bride from a nunnery and keeps her captive in a gilded cage. DeSade throws this into the face of the physician in a most entertaining drama performed by mental patients, but the physician does not even blink. Thus we see the difference between those who are the servants of repression and remain in denial (the priest) as compared to those who relish the role of repression and are happy servants of a repressive state (the physician).

High drama carries these themes forward with certain tragedy for the innocent and those the state wishes to crush. And yet, in the end, we are reminded that the erotic, always a force for freedom and expression, will alway rise against the repressive forces of religion and the state. Wonderful entertainment, great acting by top talent, witty and thoughtful dialogue, and an enduring theme well explored - and thus highly recommended.",1140739200,2,2794,4.913135593220339

1327130,2,B00003CXPV,"""Quills"" tells of the last days of the infamous Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush), who wrote erotic stories that shocked and delighted readers in 18th century France.  He is living a rather privileged life as an inmate in an asylum run by a sympathetic cleric (Joaquin Phoenix), where he produces his plays for the nobility.  Sade is allowed to write, but not to publish; however, a young laundry maid (Kate Winslet) admires him and smuggles his work out of the asylum.  The Emperor, Napoleon, dislikes his books and orders that Sade be stopped once and for all.  Sade's paper, ink, and quills are confiscated, and the cruel Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) is sent to oversee the asylum.

The dialogue is literate and elegant and the acting is first-rate.  Rush is dazzlingly flamboyant, Winslet is winsome and sweet, Phoenix is noble and earnest, and Caine is despicably cruel. The story and the brutal way it is presented, however, were repellant to me, and I found it difficult to watch.  If cruelty offends you, you probably won't like ""Quills.""

1327179,3,B00003CXPV,"This is not really a review of the film ""Quills,"" but rather a look at the historical accuracy or lack thereof of the movie. The film has been justifiably praised for its fine writing, direction and acting. But just how ""true"" is it? BE WARNED, if you haven't seen the film there is information in the article that could potentially spoil the film for you. There are also a few unpleasant details of the life of the notorious Marquis de Sade contained in the descriptions below.

Spoilers Alert

""Quills"" purports to be the story of the Marquis de Sade's final years as an inmate in the asylum at Charenton under ""administrative arrest."" Sade's stay at Charenton has already be immortalized in the Peter Weiss play (that was later made into a movie) ""Marat/Sade."" The main characters are Sade; the Abbe Coulmier, the director of the asylum; Madeleine, a laundress in the asylum who helps Sade smuggle his writings to his publishers; and, Dr. Royer-Collard, the chief physician sent by Napoleon to silence Sade. All of these characters are in fact historical persons who were involved in Sade's final years of imprisonment, though, as we shall see, quite differently in some cases than as portrayed in the film.

Sade, the so-called ""Divine Marquis,"" played by Geoffrey Rush (who won an Oscar for his role in ""Shine"") was imprisoned during Napoleon's regime under a kind of lettre de cachet in part because of his alleged authorship of a pornographic novel attacking Napoleon's wife Josephine entitled Zolo (which he probably didn't write) and due to a campaign in the press attacking him for his libertinage and pornographic writings in general, including the novel Justine. Sade had already spent much of his life in prison for various offenses, having been incarcerated under the ancien regime and the Revolution, before being held in custody under Napoleon (nor was he released after the Restoration). Sade was transferred to Charenton due to the urgings of Sade's ex-wife and children, the family paying some 8,000 francs for his upkeep. Sade's comfortable existence in the insane asylum at Charenton, outside Paris, was preferable to incarceration in a state prison.

Sade's room at Charenton included an antechamber fitted out as a study, a library of more than 250 volumes whose windows had pleasant views over the hospital grounds to the Marne, and living quarters with a fireplace. Sade was free to walk about the grounds and was free to be visit or be visited. Sade entertained in his rooms several times a week, often entertaining some of Paris' prettiest actresses. He was also frequently visited by a barber. On one occasion Sade was even allowed to leave the grounds to attend mass St.-Maurice on Easter Sunday 1805. Even Sade's mistress, whom he designated his ""illegitimate daughter,"" was allowed lived with him at Charenton after 1804, had an adjoining room. He also apparently had a valet to look after his needs. On the other hand, however, the police did keep Sade under surveillance, confiscating not only the occasional pornographic writings (which were later burned at the direct order and in the presence of Sade's son) but also various implements of a sexual nature. During one raid, police found ""an enormous wax instrument...which showed traces of its ignoble [self] introduction.""

A description of Sade during his time at Charenton is quite unlike the appearance of Geoffrey Rush in the film, although Sade did affect wigs of pre-Revolutionary styles. Sade was described as ""very big, very fat, very cold, very heavy, a large mass, a vulgar, short man whose head seemed a shameful ruin."" Needless to say, Sade never had his tongue cut out as in the film, though that image presents a good allegory for the supposed censorship of Sade's writing.

The real Abb Coulmier, played by the young, upcoming actor Joaquin Phoenix (he played the Roman emperor Commodus in the film Gladiator), was, unlike the portrayal in the movie, already sixty-one years of age -two years younger than Sade-when Sade arrived at Charenton. Franois Simonet de Coulmier was a defrocked priest and moderate Jacobin member of the Constituent Assembly. Unlike the good-looking young actor who portrays him, Coulmier in real life was described as a ""sort of gnome with gnarled legs."" Coulmier was apparently 4 feet tall (just about the height the film makes the 5' 6"" Napoleon appear), hunchbacked, with twisted legs, bulging eyes and an oversized head - not quite the handsome young abb of the film. Coulmier and Sade ""shared a common taste for women and libertinage, [and] a pronounced penchant for pleasures of all kinds..."" Like Sade, Coulmier was a dandy (in spite of his looks), with refined ancien regime manners (in spite of his revolutionary leanings) and was a bit of a snob. Coulmier, who had gone into hiding during the height of the Terror, rallied early to Napoleon's cause and received the coveted Legion of Honor from Napoleon.

Coulmier's semi-enlightened administration of Charenton was of more concern to France's medical establishment, who opposed Coulmier because he wasn't a medical doctor, than of Napoleon's government. It was Coulmier who advocated the use of the so-called ""terror baths"", which were in use prior to Dr. Royer-Collard's arrival. Coulmier on taking over the asylum at Charenton retained many of the treatment practices which we would see as brutal, including locking the worst cases in a wicker cage, the use of straight-jackets and the ""terror baths"" -all blamed on Royer-Collard in the film. He also employed treatments that at the time were considered quite ""enlightened,"" including diets, bleeding, and purges. After Napoleon's fall and the restoration of the Bourbons, Coulmier was relieved of his duties, probably because of his revolutionary past and given a government bonus of 35,589 francs. He was replaced by M. de Maupas, who was married to Royer-Collard's eldest daughter. Royer-Collard was not a committed Bonapartist, instead he had pronounced Royalist leanings.

Dr. Antoine Royer-Collard, played by Michael Caine, became chief physician at Charenton after the previous physician, a famed gourmand, died from overeating (another indication that life at Charenton may not have been all that horrible). Royer-Collard, as a physician, had a professional rivalry with Coulmier. Upon his arrival Royer-Collard asked for the records of all the inmates -a not unreasonable request-- and Coulmier refused to forward them to the doctor. Royer personally disliked Sade and disliked Sade's special privileges, especially he presence of Sade's mistress and Sade's theater, both of which Royer-Collard though inappropriate for a mental institution. In fact, many of the inmates themselves disliked Coulmier's regime as much as they disliked Sade himself. One was to complain to the government, ""what would you say about a hospital in which balls and concerts, and occasionally splendid dinners, are given to or three times a week, while unfortunate patients are treated like criminals, most of them bedded on straw like dogs, with a tiny bit of worn blanket for cover?"" Compare that treatment with Sade's described above. The theater at Charenton continued to operate until a year after Sade's death. Although the majority of the minor roles were played by the asylum's inmates, the starring roles were usually played by professional actors from Paris. Numerous Charenton inmates complained of Sade's haughty, imperious, and brutal nature.

The last of the film's major characters, Madeleine, played by Titanic's Kate Winslet, was also a real person. Magdeleine Leclerc, whose mother, acting as Sade's procuress was a mere twelve years old in 1808 and was only eighteen when Sade died; a fact that would have made the film Sade look somewhat less romantic to contemporary viewers. Magdeleine was paid 3 francs for each liaison with Sade, though the sixty-year-old Sade, who had a pronounced persecution complex (perhaps with good reason), felt the girl was taking advantage of him. At times he thought her ""one of those spies, placed near condemned men, who attempt to glean their secrets"" and complained of ""her coldness, her insouciance in pleasure and in conversations."" He also thought that there had been ""more forthrightness and honesty in her when she was a child."" Jealous of his young partner, Sade made the teenager promise to attend no dances, have no visitors and go on no dates.

Sade kept detailed, though coded, records of his interactions with the young girl, recording that he first sodomized Magdeleine when she was about fifteen years old (he was reportedly also sodomizing a young boy from the asylum at about the same time). By 1814 Sade had noted in his journal that he had sodomized the girl more than 64 times, along with other sexual encounters with her. All during this time Sade's mistress continued to live with him at Charenton. By the way, Magdeleine was not murdered by the inmates of the asylum -a scene seemingly borrowed from the end of Weiss' ""Marat/Sade"".

It was the government that ordered Sade to be deprived of the materials for producing additional writings after 1810 (Sade had been deprived of writing material while imprisoned in the Bastille during the ancien regime). Sade however continued to write, though he had some trouble obtaining pens, ink and paper. He continued though to keep a journal (a volume of which was seized in 1810 and another in 1814) and in 1813 he submitted a play to the Comedie-Franaise. In the previous year Sade had written a cantata in honor of a visit by Cardinal Maury, Archbishop of Paris, as well as a novel; so the attempts to curtail Sade's writing was not pursued very vigorously.

Napoleon is played for laughs in his brief appearance in the film, sitting like a naughty boy on his oversized throne and conferring with his Marshals and court portrayed as ancient ne'er-do-wells. Francine du Plessix Gray has written the following on Napoleon and Sade ""To what degree was the Emperor of the French involved in the decisions concerning Sade? By 1809, Napoleon was confronted with far more weighty matters than the repression of aging libertines....On two occasions, in 1811 and 1812, he would sign with his own hand the ministerial decrees that ordered Sade to remain in detention...[and] stated that he had ""leafed through the most abominable book [probably, Sade's Justine] that a depraved imagination ever conceived: a novel that even at the time of the Convention had so revolted public morals that [Sade] had been jailed. One of Sade's sons, an army officer, had served with Napoleon during the 1795 Vendmiaire uprising [and was later murdered by guerrillas in Italy] and a number of Sade's plays included couplets in praise of the Imperial family (perhaps in an attempt to curry favor).",1126396800,6,10814,5.096501128668171
1327180,5,B00003CXPV,"I've always admired Kate Winslet's acting skills and her honesty (especially when it comes to the all too-consuming weight issue).  I also admire the fact that she didn't fall into the trap of taking empty, vapid roles after the phenomenal success of Titanic in 1997 (even if she was never nominated for an Oscar for that role).

Quills is about the evils of censorship and the hypocrisy of those behind it.  It's also about the bravery and determination of some people - those who don't have power - to fight the ugliness of censorship every chance they get.

Geoffrey Rush played a fine Marquis de Sade and, in that role, we see that he goes mad from not being able to express himself.  In time, he goes from a plush prison cell to having to write with his own blood and feces.  In the end, he withers away even more, and eventually dies, in shackles and chains.

The viewer should not expect a happy ending with Quills because there is no happy ending with censorship.

While it does feature exceptional performances (especially from Kate Winslet- what a fabulous actress)and has potentially fascinating premise, the end made me laugh too much to take it seriously.  The movie took too many pains to drum into the audience how like one of the Marquis' stories the actual events in the movie were. Are we that dumb that we need so many hints? The 'twist' which is horrifically out of place and woefully contrived left me saying 'oh those tricky tricky filmmakers!' Turning Joaquin Phoenix into a mini de Sade, how clever! While Quills is worth watching for the performances (and the pleasant surprise of finding Lorna Doone from the movie Lorna Doone in a small role as Michael Caine's wife) don't go out of your way.",1120435200,2,822,4.864285714285714

His sexual fantasies make today's smuttiest romance novels look like fairy tales. His work is in defense against the repression and hypocrisy of his society, but can we feel sorry for a writer who embraces freedom of expression with his own hypocrisy? It makes one relieved that this movie was adapted by Doug Wright from his own stage play and is a work of fiction. Beware: Too much blood and nudity!",1115424000,7,800,4.925925925925926

The film begins with a bloody beheading and I personally left near the end when a mentally deficient inmate was put in a small cage to be tortured.  You know, folks, it takes greater skill and creativity to make a point with out the viewers all having to go through hell to ""get it"".

1327187,4,B00003CXPV,"The story of the Marquis de Sade, whose name is inextricably linked with the word ""sadism,"" comes alive in this absorbing but graphic depiction of 18th century attitudes toward love and sex, mental illness, religion, and crime and punishment in France.  Adapting his stageplay for the screen, author Doug Wright sets the action primarily in the Charenton asylum, where the Marquis de Sade occupied a lavish cell.  Philip Kaufman directs this noir film, which is filled with ironies and raises questions about who is sicker--the inmates or their wardens.

Geoffrey Rush, nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor, is a terrifying Marquis de Sade, showing his wild rages, cruelty, and self-destruction, but also his need for understanding and human contact. Obsessively writing pornographic novels from his cell, he has a laundress smuggle them out to a delighted public.  Dr. Royer-Collard, director of the asylum (sneeringly played by Michael Caine) is coldly formal, a believer in cruel punishment as a deterrent from abnormal behavior, his ""punishments"" rivaling anything the Marquis dreams up.

Madeleine LeClerq (winningly played by Kate Winslet), a lively laundress with a sense of adventure, is intrigued by the Marquis and helps him, showing herself to be more human and less a caricature than most of the other characters.  Joachin Phoenix sensitively portrays the Abbe de Coulmier, a young priest who believes in the basic goodness of man, showing him as he agonizes over the conflicts between his church, his growing love for Madeleine, and his revulsion of Royer-Collard's perversities.

This film is violent and graphic, with some nudity, but the screenplay is elegantly written, filled with observations which both illustrate and elevate its themes.  The dialogue is brilliant, though often more formal than one would expect of the inmates, conveying ideas at the same time that it accompanies violent action.  The cinematography (Rogier Stoffers), with its dark prison scenes and close-ups of blood, dismemberment, and torture (some of it self-mutilation), combined with the costuming (Jacqueline West), make the nether-world of Charenton come alive visually.

Though the violence may be accurate and appropriate to the times, it is so pervasive and so graphic here that it seems to pander to an audience's baser emotions--it feels like a stage play given an extremely violent overlay for film.  Still, the cast is wonderful, the story is absorbing, and the themes--what is morality, and how, if at all, should society control it?--are fully explored and presented.

1327217,3,B00003CXPV,"Don't get me wrong, now. ""Quills"" is a very good movie and very well-acted. But I doubt you'd be that impressed by it if you had seen the play first.

 I saw an amateur theatre company (but a damn good one) perform ""Quills"" in July of 2004. The play as written kicks the intensity, violence, and humor up several notches above the film. Ironically, the screenplay for ""Quills"" was written by the playwright of ""Quills"", so it is interesting to see the variations from one medium to the other.

 Rather than go on and on about each and every differece between the two, I will highlight just a couple. In the play but not in the film, the Marquis De Sade's punishments for continuing to write and incite do not stop with having his toungue cut out. In the play, after it is discovered he uses his hands to write on the walls with his own excrement, his hands and feet get cut off. The Marquis is reduced to a tongueless, extremity-less growling stump of a beast [the agonizing, painful moans by the stage actor were absolutely chilling!!!!!]. Yet the asylum's director still feels that Sade is still a ""moral threat"", so he has the Marquis' most private of parts cut off as well, lest the Marquis use that as his ""quill"" (innuendo such as that are even more prevalent in the play than the film). The asylum director thinks that if the Marquis has no ""physical manifestation"" of his pornographic desires, then he will be cured by default.

 However, the asylum director and the young Abbe of the asylum discover yet another seemingly innoucuous story the Marquis had composed in his last capable days. The story is anything but pornographic - it is the brief tale of a young woman getting fitted for a wedding dress. But because the Asylum director is currently humiliated by the infidelity of his wife, he finds a way to ""read between the lines"" of the Marquis' tale and find the subtle yet (in the director's mind) obvious and grotesque pornographic message in it.

 That is one of the key elements of the play that is not touched on very well in the film: Sometimes what is objectionable or deemed pornographic is subjective. There is not a single word, phrase, or idea in the wedding-dress tale that is in itself objectionable, but the director CHOSE to interpret it in the most pornographic way possible, both out of his own personal sexual frustration and in light of the well-earned reputation of the tale's author.

 Therefore, the director reasons, the Marquis is still capable of engaging in his ""despicable"" behavior. So long as the Marquis' mind is still functioning, he can never be ""cured"" of his illness. So the director tells the Abbe to have the Marquis beheaded.

 In the play we witness (or, rather, hear in the darkness of the theatre) each dismemberment and the beheading itself. And the Abbe's act of necrophelia -- the product of his encroaching madness -- is played out as real event on stage, but in the film it is just the Abbe's bad dream.

 See what I mean? The film version of ""Quills"" seems almost sanitized compared to the stage version (or at least the production I saw).

 So why bring all this up in a review of the ""Quills"" DVD?

 To point out that the film, while good, has a lot of unrealized potential. While I believe none of the explicitness of the stage play is gratuitous or deliberately sensational, I do believe that it better demonstrates the essential contrast -- that the vulgarity of what one man can produce (the Marquis' stories) PALES in comparison to the vulgar atrocities launched against him (dismemberment/vivisection/execution) in the names of Science, Medicine, Religion, and Moral Cleanliness.

 The fact that the Asylum director found the innocuous tale to be far and away the most vulgar and offensive of them all is key to understanding that how we choose to respond to material is perhaps more important and relevant than the material itself.

 The film dances around this but never quite lands on it. Too bad, because it would have given the film a much deeper resonance.

 But it might have also killed its chances at the box office. The Theatre can afford to be more eclectic, risky, and challenging than the mass-medium of Film can.",1091577600,8,4195,4.683923705722071

Throw in some action and intrigue, for example, our incarcerated prisoner having to smuggle his lurid works out of the asylum via a sweet, innocent maid who gains vicarious pleasure from reading the stories to self and others.

Geoffrey Rush plays Marquise De Sade with perfection....what other actor could play a pale, ugly, pervert with such conviction.

What after all makes Marquis mind work the way it does?  On one had he writes like a madman about appalling acts that would make even the devil himself shutter; he then suprises us with a twist of philosophical genius that applies to reason and shows us that he has the sort of insight into human nature that tends to disturb us.  Is he truly a madman who intrigues us?  or is he a persecuted genius?  of course we will never know.
The Marquis at the very least makes us think and examine ourselves and what's in our ""particular"" nature. We all have some fantasies that might not be deemed as normal, but we of course don't have the courage to ""amuse"" them as he did for fear of being shunned or even condemend by society.

1327284,4,B00003CXPV,"I enjoyed this film quite a bit, but after a little reflection I realized that it doesn't come close to doing Sade justice.  He was more than just a blasphemer; this movie panders to the fashionable psychological explanation of Sade as ""the wicked believer"", or the religious man so horrified by the world that he sublimates debauchery into religion.  At the conclusion of the film Sade swallows the cross rather than kisses it.  I guess that's supposed to be a big deal, shocking or something.  Whoever played Sade did a good job, but the 'I will not be silenced' bit got overdone and Sade never had to go to any of these lengths to release his work.  He recites passages from ""Philosophy in the Boudoir"" like a fifteen year old reading the Penthouse column to his friends for the first time.
Sade had his own theories, his own passions apart from his hatred of Christianity.  Kate Winslet does a wonderful job.  The priest is also intense, naive and believable.  But the whole thing is simply 'too Sade to be Sade'.  Subtlety is needed for a writer of his magnitude.",1067385600,2,1068,4.608465608465608

Marquis de Sade is locked away in an insane asylum, run by a well intentioned, but somewhat insecure priest, who allows Marquis to ""expel the demons in his head"" through his writings. Things then become interesting, as his writings are smuggled out of the asylum, and spread throughout France. These sexually graphic writings fall into Napolean's hands, and he is outraged, and sends in ""the doctor"" to attempt to silence the Marquis.
I will say no more, other than that this is a powerful tale, with heavy emphasis on the characters, the clashing of their ideals, hypocricy, censorship and SEX.

1327286,4,B00003CXPV,"America's most ""European"" director, Philip Kaufman (""Incredible Lightness Of Being"", ""Henry & June"") once again aims his lens at a literary, historical romance. The ""romance"" in ""Quills"" is not so much about literal love and sex, as it is with the IDEA of sexual fantasy and the freedom to imagine and express it. This is not an idea that translates easily to film, but Kaufman still manages to entertain us without resorting to cheap titillation. The story takes place near the end of the Marquis de Sade's stormy life-spent in an insane asylum. Geoffrey Rush chews up the scenery as the decadent Marquis. Kate Winslet is the virginal yet free-spirited chambermaid who smuggles de Sade's infamous manuscripts out of the institution for outside publication. Joaquin Phoenix gives his best (least annoying?) performance as the young priest secretly infatuated with Winslet and somewhat asexually intrigued by the Marquis. The ubiquitous Michael Caine is the ""doctor"" (today we might call him a ""government spook"") sent by the King to destroy de Sade's literary career (with extreme prejudice). Stylistically, the film sometimes evokes one of Ken Russell's over-the-top biopics like ""The Music Lovers"" or ""Lisztomania"". The film does remind us how precious artistic expression is and why it is our duty to ensure that Church, State and Art always remain seperated (all hail Lenny Bruce and Bill Maher!).",1055721600,5,1401,5.231111111111111

1327288,4,B00003CXPV,"A highly dramatic account of The Divine Marquis, taking artistic license and an unconventional approach to whom I would consider a de-facto Satanist of his day.
Ever the insatiable writer with a fertile, and many would consider ""perverted"" imagination, yet the true 'perversion' would be to stunt the creative process with perfidious and sanctimonious limitations, as the man was only remaining true to himself, honest with his nature, and allowed himself to evolve no matter the cost, even at the price of his own freedom and suffering at the pangs of discomfort and censure. Yet this daemonic tenacity was most inspiring, expressing his craft using what he will to satiate, even if only for a small time, the incessant desire to create. And this is demonstrated very poignantly by the character of DeSade when imprisoned - even from his prison cell encased within an asylum for the criminally-insane, primarily and ironically for his writing, where he continued to produce work; and with the help of the wash girl, whom he had of course copulated with, her mind was so enraptured by his passionate words, she delivered his titillating tales to be published until, his what could be equated to a ""probation officer"", as it were, a priest who is at obvious odds with himself, as his mind often wanders into realms of carnal consideration; discovers the Marquis' forbidden literature is somehow still seeing print. So he orders DeSade's pen and paper taken away, to which he continues to publish nonetheless. It turns out that he had actually been using red wine with a chicken bone upon a blanket to write, along with the help of the laundry girl continues to ingeniously produce.

The next remarkable instance was that after the priest discovers this ploy, the Marquis actually uses his own blood as ink, and his inner shirt as paper, and again sends it out to be published. Finally, this too is discovered, and so he is condemned to remain in the cold, desolate stone cell naked. Yet not even this prevents DeSade, for what should transpire next, but an olfactory literation comprised of feces on the walls, to the utter horror of the clergy man. Ideas spawned in the third dimension brought into the fourth, in whatever manner possible. The voice of genius cannot be silenced, even when all else is taken away. When the priest comes to inspect DeSade, the sight as well as an infernal dissertation by DeSade exposing the priest's inner-most being and repressed psyche summarily drives him insane. DeSade is eventually released, but the priest takes his place within the fetid halls of the asylum, seemingly possessed by DeSade's words which now reverberate in his mind ceaselessly. The impression was as if DeSade's scathing, flaming tongue of undefiled wisdom implanted a demon seed into the priest's brain, and alas, it seems his sheltered and self-righteous, limited comprehension could not process it, and so, madness took effect. But instead of living life to the fullest with this new-found knowledge, he condemns himself to another mental and literal cage bourne of perfidy, much less organized.
In conclusion, for all of the oppression DeSade endured, his body was imprisoned from time to time, but his mind was not. How many artists, musicians, writers, ectetera, would do the same if forced into a similar situation?
Quills is a recommended film for its aesthetic beauty as well as for its penchant to inspire contemplation on all levels of being - physically, mentally, emotionally, and even sexually. In this case, DeSade acted as an iconoclastic libertine to move man's fleshly awareness forward, and was a predecessor to much of the erotic novellas to this day.
Before DeSade came forth, anal sex was known as ""buggery"", his work and reputation would eventually affix an additional title to the fetishistic practice, to be called ""sodomy"" - but that is certainly not all his work inspired, although his antagonists seemed to have focused excessively thereof - he indeed helped to facilitate, mold, and contribute to the evilution of erotica as we know it today.
DeSade was truly before his time - and now, his opuses may be experienced and perhaps ideas shared by his readers, while his oppressors have passed away into forgetfulness. His infamy preceded him, and his scandalous reputation helped him earn a place in history and thus, bestowed immortality.",1048896000,2,4373,5.015130674002751
1327328,5,B00003CXPV,"This review refers to the 20th Cent Fox DVD edition of ""Quills""...

I can think of several films based on historical events or figures that do not follow the facts exactly, yet are enlightening, entertaining and are considered fine films as well. Two of recent times that come to mind immediatley are ""The Hurricane"" and ""The Insider"".These stories gave us an insight into events that we may not have known about or paid little attention to until the film burst onto the screen. Here we have another story that although was inspired by the life and the writings of the Marquis de Sade is clearly defined as an original work by writier Doug Wright.

In the late 18th century, we find Sade(Geoffrey Rush) committed to a mad house, as his literay works are so outrageously sexual and ""sadistic"", that he is accussed of inciting others to act out in evil ways. He, along with the other inmates, is cared for by the head of the asylum. a liberal priest, The Abbe du Coulmier(Joaquin Phoenix). Coulmier is a progressive thinker and allows Sade and the others artisitc freedoms within the confines of the asylum.

Sade has a passion for writing and is smuggling his provacative stories out with a beautiful young laundry maid(Kate Winslet) who has befriended him. They are published and all of France is is eager to read them. Napolean is appalled and appoints Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to oversee the activities at the asylum. Collard's methods and thinking prove to be as cruel as any the Marquis could write about.

The Abbe trying to cooperate begins by taking away Sade's writing material, all his quills and ink, and eventually all of Sade's belongings. Sade becomes obsessed with wanting the freedom to write and goes to great extremes, using first wine, then his own blood and eventually other body excrements to accomplish what he feels is his right.
The more they try to stop him, the more obsessive he becomes. It is also interesting to note that, as these books became banned, the more the masses clamored for them.

Directed by Phillip Kaufman, this film has alot to offer and poses many questions to the viewer. It does not glorify the Marquis de Sade, nor does it make him the extreme villan. So was Sade a madman, or pioneer for freedom of speech? Can the freedom to write pornographic material incite others to act out their agressions? And if so, are these traits already within those persons?  These are issues that are still prevalant today. The story of ""The People vs Larry Flint"" comes to mind as a more contemporary case.

The film is wonderfully made and acted. It is cutting edge and makes great use of the Marquis' wickedness, his wit and his prose. There are stories within stories. All the performances were exquiste and  I especially thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding. The cinematography and costumes add greatly to this period piece. Also adding their wonderful talents are Billie Whitelaw as Madame Le Clerc and Jane Menelaus as Renne Pelagie(Sade's wife). Jane is Geoffrey Rush's real life wife and their chemistry exudes on the screen. The movie was honored with Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor(Phoenix) form the National Board of Review.

There are some disturbing as well as some sexual scenes, so this film may not be for everyone.

A terrific DVD package. First of all it is a beautiful transfer. The film is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen(1.85:1) and is clear and sharp with excellent colors. Sound set-up gives the choice of 5.1 Surround or Stereo surround(Dolby)and everything is clear and distinct. There are 3 featurettes and some very enlightening commentary by the writer(Wright). It may be viewed in French(Stereo) and has subtitles in English and Spanish.

Was the Marquis de Sade a raving lunatic or a great literary figure?  You decide....

Thanks and enjoy......Laurie

1327330,5,B00003CXPV,"This movie is loosely based on the life of the novelist marquis de sade, a man whose name inspired the word ""sadism."" that reveals something about sade's character right away. so DO NOT expect a lighthearted flick about a randy old man! this movie is way dark and graphic. it's rated R for a reason so if you can't handle nudity, violence, and really depressing sex, turn away and don't say i didn't warn you.
THE PLOT
marquis de sade (rush), a french author of graphically perverse S&M novels, is imprisioned inside Charenton, an asylum for the mentally ill. charenton is run by the happy, constantly grinning abbe de coulmiers (phoenix), who thinks that it's good for sade to write his smut to cleanse his mind, as long as they don't get published. but he doesn't know that the raunchy, yet innocent chambermaid (winslet) is smuggling the marquis's chapters out of the asylum with the laundry. the books quickly wind their way to the publishers, where they become huge bestsellers. even napoleon gets hold of the latest copy and becomes thoroughly disgusted with the content. a doctor, royers-collard (caine) is sent to charenton to cure the marquis of his ""madness."" r.c. is known for employing torture techniques to cure his patients, such as dunking them in brackish water, or putting them in isolation. with r.c.'s coming, the (relatively) jolly days of the marquis at the asylum are over. the movie, which started out darkly funny and kinky, filled with innuendo and bantering, now just becomes dark. madeleine the chambermaid is discovered to be smuggling the manuscripts, and sade's ink and quills are taken away. sade begins to grow desperate, and is eventually forced to use his own blood and excrement to write. coulmiers is torn between his feelings for the church, his unusual friendship with sade, the repulsion he has for sade's writing, and his love (?) or lust for madeleine. then r.c's wife gets a hold of sade's writing, which fuels her on to elope with her lover. r.c's anger with sade is now personal and he makes SURE sade cannot write. but sade will not give up. because he has been deprived of all writing utensils, madeleine thinks of a genius way for him to ""write"" another novel. but the power of sade's words turn the ""writing session"" into a horrid fiasco... in fact, the climax of the movie is SO depressing and shocking (the scene with the bleeding crucifix) that the weird and predictable ending is actually liberating and satisfying. let me just say no one came out of this movie smiling.
THE ACTORS
Geoffrey Rush: whoever chose russell crowe over him at the oscars needs to be smacked in the head. rush doesn't need to swing big swords around to prove his worth. all he needs is a quill... i can go on and on about his acting and his grace, even when he's been stripped of everything (and i mean EVERYTHING) he has. he isn't playing marquis de sade. he IS marquis de sade.
joaquin phoenix: whoa. emotional overload there. all those conflicting emotions that bombard him can be seen in those green eyes. his emotional spiral downward is WAY intense, and yet 100% believable. the scenes with madeleine made my stomach flip so many times. (plus, he's hot.)
kate winslet: after watching this movie, i've become a fan of hers. she portrays madeleine as a girl with many facets. madeleine isn't just a ""virginal chambermaid."" she keeps a flirty but platonic relationship with sade, she doesn't sleep around yet she devours sade's smut. she has a real affection for coulmiers, and yet she wants to run away with the horseman. kate makes madeleine a character who possesses all the virtues and vices of a real girl, not a 1 dimensional side character.
michael caine: royers-collard was so evil. so evil. i wanted to punch the tv at the end of the movie. then i wanted to hug michael caine for doing such a good job. the funny man in miss congeniality he ain't.
THE DVD
eh. the special features were so-so. the regular stuff. the commentary, the featurette, the trailers. but you're buying this movie for the MOVIE not the special features, i'm assuming.
OVERALL
five stars!! this is a brilliant piece of moviemaking. good dialogue, good actors, good plot. best movie i've seen in a long time. if you want a dark, sharply humourous, shocking, deep, (a little) romantic, sexy, and emotional gut wrenching ride, then watch quills. this movie is not a biography. it's very fictionalized. so please remember, ""this is a work of FICTION. not a moral treatise.""",1042934400,10,4481,4.768339768339768
1327331,1,B00003CXPV,"I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy in movies, but Quills is outrageous in its misrepresentation of its subject, the Marquis DeSade; for a movie that is ostensibly about the limits of free expression, director/writer Phil kaufmann commits the unpardonable crime of substituting his own words for DeSades when the author's works are quoted on screen.  When bits of ""Justine"" or ""Juliette"" are read, we hear innocuous, harmless erotica reminiscent of Jon Lovitz's ""Tales of Ribaldry"" skit from Saturday Night Live.  DeSade's works are like the diaries of a serial killer -- designed to test limits and make us uncomfortable.  Read aloud in a movie, the MPAA  would slap the film with a NC-17.

  This is among the most moving films I've ever seen.  The characters, while perhaps not 100% true to historical fact, are fascinating and played phenomenally well, from key-player Rush to the minor characters who I still can't name the actors behind them, but are still ingrained into my memory.  It is directed with a kinetic, eye-catching flair and is paced wonderfully; avoiding the boring, dragging mode that most films with a historical base have.
  I feel that this is a very moving film with an extremely positive message, and that its important for anybody to see; not just ACLU devotees such as myself.",1030406400,,881,4.833333333333333
1327375,4,B00003CXPV,"Having read the works of the Marquis at great length, I was quite enthused to see Quills, and I was not the least bit disappointed. It depicts the Marquis as a man of great talent with words, but a man haunted by lust and perversion. His imprisonment in Charenton (a French insane asylum) only inspired his insatiable lust, which spilled out onto paper.
Geoffrey Rush gives his most memorable performance as the Marquis, giving wit and grace, as well as repulsion. Joaquin Pheonix (donning a convincing English accent) plays Abbe, the preist who runs the asylum, who is pushed to his wits end by the Marquis resistance to his treatment. Much of the movie focuses on the duality between these two characters. Kate Winslet and Michael Caine give stellar supporting roles, with Winslet as the laundry lass who falls for the Marquis, and Caine as the menacing doctor who comes on behalf of Napolean to silence the Marquis, who is smuggling his writings out of the hospital for publication. All actors play their roles with passion and compassion, making Quills one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a while.
What was equally striking was the costumes and sets, which were made, at great expense no doubt, to fully resemble the attire and settings of that time. Charenton, in which much of the movie takes place, is amazingly detailed, giving the movie a very authentic feel. What is covered at great length on the DVD is the costume and set design, in which we get to meet the people who labored intensely to create a masteful period piece.
After seeing Quills, you will most likely be tempted to read the works of the Marquis. That is the real gift of a good movie, where it inspires you to think beyond the scope of the movie itself. What you will get from Quills, at the very least, is a well acted, well written, and superbly made movie.",1029628800,6,1850,4.6432926829268295
1327376,2,B00003CXPV,"Reading the jacket for this film one might think it was a cute, somewhat titillating, European comedy about the randy but lovable Marquis and his uptight persecutors.  Uh, no.  The problem with this film is its subject.  I'd heard of De Sade but had no idea how depraved and degenerate his work really is.  The stories that the film would have you believe are breathlessly awaited by a titillated Paris are essentially well written but exceedingly graphic descriptions of the most vile and disgusting ""sex"" acts imaginable.  It is most definitely not erotica.
I am no prude, but I quickly lost any sympathy for this character, which meant I either had to root for his equally appalling persecutors or somehow identify with one of the supporting characters, such as the tormented and confused priest.  No thanks.  This movie is basically well-produced well-acted high-minded [stuff].  The message fails because in the end the ""good"" guy was just as bad, if not worse, than the ""bad"" guys.  The Marquis was not a misunderstood ""artist"" but rather an adolescent pervert who probably deserved to be locked away.  A truly distasteful film, all in all.",1029196800,7,1146,4.952879581151833
1327377,4,B00003CXPV,"Come with me to the bowels of France's unspeakable hell: Charenton Abbey, a madhouse of the 18th century. Here, within its thick stone walls, inmates are subjected to every possible cruelty, many of which are beyond watching, at least for this reviewer.
And now we enter the lavishly appointed cell of the infamous Marquis de Sade, whose brilliant rendering by Geoffrey Rush will leave an indelible imprint on your mind. Incarcerated in the asuylum for his sadomasochistic writings (and doings, one presumes), the Marquis is, despite his predelictions, a sly, brilliant, and totally mad genius. His writing keeps him alive; his life has become narrowed to the point where his writing IS his freedom, and nothing can or will stop him.
Smuggling de Sade's risque and shocking manuscripts out of the madhouse, virginal laundress Madeleine, played wonderfully by Kate Winslet (who is given much more of a chance to show her considerable acting talents than she was in ""Titanic""), is drawn to his writings--and to the Marquis himself--like the proverbial moth to the flame. But their strange relationship is never consummated. Nor is the strong desire between Madeleine and the tortured Abbe Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), torn apart by his conflicting loves of the church and the woman.
Michael Caine gives a chilling performance as the cold, evil hypocrite, Dr. Royer-Collard, sent to take control of the madhouse and silence the Marquis (whose smuggled works are being read by all of France) once and for all.
The darkness and horror of this film, rendered beautifully by Philip Kaufman's inspired direction, is sparked throughout by the increasingly insane brilliance of the Marquis' incredible wit and ingenuity in continuing to write. Deprived of his quills, he turns to wine and a chicken bone, then to his own blood, and finally, his feces as he leads the viewer on an inexorable descent into the madness of despair.
Very hard to watch, very depressing, but so brilliant, especially in the tour de force by Geoffrey Rush, that it is a must-see for anyone who takes film seriously.",1026518400,4,2080,5.084795321637427
1327378,5,B00003CXPV,"The Marquis de Sade has been portrayed on film before, but never this well. Geoffrey Rush is riveting, making him both compelling and disgusting at the same time. A lesser actor would have turned de Sade's scenes into ""moments"" that could be safely played during an Oscar telecast, but Rush is fantastic.
The Marquis smuggles his writings out of the insane asylum he is in through a laundress, played by Kate Winslet. She is under the tutorship of the young priest Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix is trying to help the insane by getting them involved in the arts, and the Marquis is writing popular pornography for the French masses. Napoleon gets in a flutter, and sends the harsh doctor Michael Caine to the asylum. Caine himself has problems as he has just gone through on an arranged marriage with a young teenage girl just out of the convent.
The new bride gets a hold of de Sade's work and eventually runs off with her chateau's architect...de Sade, an outspoken atheist, must find other ways of continuing his writing, and does in some very horrific manners.
There is not really a plot here, as the Marquis' privileges are eventually taken away to the point that he is nude in his emptied cell, and still finds time to butt heads with Caine, and God.
Rush is spellbinding, to use a cliche. Joaquin Phoenix is terrific as the young priest. He fights against temptation as well as any clergyman put on screen. Michael Caine gets back into the kind of juicy roles he used to get twenty years ago. Winslet is great as the laundress.
What Philip Kaufman seems to be saying with this film is that words can and do corrupt, but they corrupt the corruptable. The Marquis' literature has negative effects on the uneducated in the film (the inmates, the asylum's illiterate employees, and the naive teen bride), and when put into context of one's life, words alone will not make one kill or fornicate. The feelings, good or bad, are there already, and the Marquis will not change that. It always angers me when some parents' group or clergyman blames the world's problems on Eminem or ""American Pie."" Impossible to patrol your children twenty four hours a day, you say? Then educate them so they know these words, the music, and the art are just that. Turn the TV off and read to them. If it is rated (R) and the kids are under 17, maybe they should not watch it. This is why I made up my own content warnings and put them at the end of each movie review I do.
I strayed off the topic a bit, but ""Quills"" is an important film that should keep people talking about art, censorship, obsession, love, sex, religion, and madness. And it is ten times better than the moldy ""Gladiator.""

1327380,5,B00003CXPV,"I'll admit it...before I saw ""Quills"" I knew nothing about the Marquis de Sade. I kept asking people to see this film with me but most of them cringed at the offer and muttered something about ""Justine."" Because of my being not only a Popkorn Junkie but a Joaquin Junkie as well I knew I had to go, even if it meant by myself. It's funny, most of the people in the audience were alone....I soon would find out why (it's kind of a dirty movie but not shocking or anything....it's intelligently dirty).
 ""Quills"" is about the notoriously perverted author the Marquis de Sade and his life while imprisoned in a mental institute. Geoffrey Rush plays the Marquis and does an excellent job portraying the character. He delivers his often devilishly loaded lines with precision....there are so many deliciously naughty innuendos in the script that I felt a little guilty taking pleasure in them. Anyway, the institution (that is the Marquis' prison) is run by the good natured and totally gorgeous Abbe Coulmier, played by Joaquin Phoenix (that's how the ""totally gorgeous"" part fits in). The Abbe encourages the Marquis to write because the Abbe feels it is a sort of therapy (he is a real forward thinker considering the times)...if the Marquis can expel the pornography from his mind perhaps he might become cured of his illness. Unfortunately the Marquis devises a plan to smuggle his writings out to the general public (which later on gets the Abbe in trouble and leads to the Marquis' demise). Kate Winslet plays the part of Madeline, a laundry girl who steals the heart of both the Marquis and the Abbe and helps the Marquis with his publishing.
 The main story in the film involves the little love triangle going on between the Marquis, Madeline, and the Abbe but the subplot involves Micheal Caine's character, the evil Dr. Royer-Collard (a far cry from the lovable Dr. Larch he played in ""The Cider House Rules""). Dr. Royer-Collard is sent to oversee the Abbe and the mental institution, however, unlike the Abbe the Dr. feels that patients will only get better if they are physically and mentally tortured (yeah, that makes sense....whatever). Anyway, I won't give away any more of the plot or the climactic ending....you'll have to give in and see ""Quills"" for yourself!
 This film is passionate and at some parts a little raunchy... mostly in an intelligent and sometimes almost poetic way but the cast is what makes this film a ""must see"". Rush and Winslet have a great chemistry together and they clearly enjoy the many chances they have to make plays on words. Phoenix burns the screen up whenever he's on as he captures the tortured feelings of a priest who must struggle with his heart and his duty.
 Recommendation: If you like ""art-house"" type movies, delicious innuendos, or any of the cast members you will take great pleasure in watching this film. But don't feel guilty...it's just a movie!",1017360000,3,2907,4.808

Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Shakespear in Love and Mystery Men), Kate Winslet (Titanic), Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator) and the great Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules) do their best to get the viewer interested but even they can only do so much.  There is nothing in Quills. It's banal, boring, not credible and a general disappointment. If you want to find out about the Marquis de Sade watch the A & E Channel's Biography on him and pick up one of his works.  They are still printed.

Only the most moronic of people would follow the writer/director into this sort of logic in the attempt to make de Sade a cushy likeable character.  The reality is that the film goes to extremes to distort the reality of what sort of man de Sade really was...one who truly did maim, burn, and torture women in his real life.  The film glosses over this with one line from the even more ruthless character of the doctor.  Why Kate Winslet even took her lame role is a question I'm still asking myself...when her role consisted mainly of being at de Sade's door asking for ""linens, please...your linens please"".  The really awful excerpts from de Sade's work was lame...and not at all allowed to build to any erotic point.  As far as I'm concerned the only interesting part of the film was when the maidservant was sandwiched between the maleservants and they were gossipping about what the nuns had told.  Naturally, none of this had anything to do with de Sade or Winslet or Joaquin Phoenix's character.  Speaking of which...the priest was the only interesting character in the film...and even then, his intrigue never really took off soon enough.

1327383,4,B00003CXPV,"Filled with flashes of brilliance, Quills is a literate, intelligent movie. It is not for everyone. Some will find it too slow, while others, especially those with little knowledge of history, will find it confusing. The biggest turn off for most viewers, however, is that it is lewd and shocking. Ironically, the film's protagonist, the Marquis De Sade, was in real life put in an insane asylum because of his shocking behavior and his pornographic writings. This happened in France over two hundred years ago. There is no evidence that he was really mentally ill, but he was certainly one of history's most amoral and notorious characters. The word 'sadism' derives from his name.
The movie opens in 1805 in the French asylum where De Sade spent his final days. The place is run by Abbe Coulmier [Joaquin Phoenix], an enlightened Catholic brother who uses tolerance and understanding as healing tools. He is much admired, but his world is soon to go haywire. One of the institution's servant girls, Madeleine [Kate Winslett], has been smuggling De Sade's [Geoffrey Rush] manuscripts out, and they have been published in Paris. When Napoleon, who has declared himself emperor of France, discovers this, he sends Dr. Royce-Collard [Michael Caine] on a mission to the asylum. He is to stop De Sade from writing by whatever means necessary. Royce-Collard has just married a girl forty years his junior. Later she plays a pivotal role in the story. At first the naive Abbe welcomes the doctor. Later, when he becomes caught in a great battle of wits between De Sade and Royce-Collard, he loses control of both the asylum and his mind.
The cast is brilliant, except for Caine, who, though a great actor, seems out of place here. Royce-Collard requires a more sinister actor. Christopher Walken or Jack Nicholson would have been perfect. Rush's performance is a dazzling one, and his Oscar nomination was well deserved.
Quills asks questions that are still most appropriate today, especially with the rise of conservatism in America. Is freedom of speech to be defended no matter what? Is there no limit to artistic expression? Can a writer really inspire some people to acts of depravity and violence, or does reading about such things satisfy a dark need in otherwise decent people? Is hypocrisy ever the right answer to things that trouble many in society? Except for the hypocrisy issue, Quills doesn't answer these questions. It lets the audience answer them.
Director Philip Kaufman has never been one to leave anything to the imagination. Quills is strong stuff, and I personally have no problem with that. That leaves us with one more question: Is Quills entertainment? Again, each viewer must decide.
NOTE: While all of the main characters actually existed, great liberty has been taken by the script's author, Doug Wright. What you see on the screen bears little resemblance to what actual went on in the asylum.",1016236800,5,2917,4.979508196721311

Somehow, Hollywood's depiction of the Marquis de Sade, whose name is the origin of the term ""sadism,"" reminds me of the fact that a film was also made depicting Larry Flynt, who owns Hustler magazine, as a heroic defender of ""free speech.""

Here, de Sade (played by Geoffrey Rush) is depicted as an heroic defender of the freedom to write pornography, much like Flynt in that regard--a tragic victim of censorship.  Of course the ""bad guy,"" his tormentor--a right-wing (what else!) moralist whom I suspect was patterned after Jerry Falwell (played by Michael Caine), is a closet pervert who ""gets off"" on sadism.

There is a plot to the picture, and the cinematography was good.  The acting was excellent by all concerned.  However, I would hardly class the film as entertainment.  It was brutal, and it glorified pornography explicitly.  The heroine (Kate Winslet) was entranced with perverted sex, although supposedly a virgin.

Altogether, I would class this one as another example of Hollywood propaganda--well made, but with a twisted message.

1327434,2,B00003CXPV,"I was completely ready to enjoy ""Quills"" based on what I had read about it beforehand, but I was sorely disappointed in the movie. Geoffrey Rush plays a feisty and perpetually aroused Marquis de Sade, locked away in an asylum but still producing flowery erotic stories to pass the time. Kate Winslet plays a sympathetic maid who smuggles his stories to publishers who turn them into best-selling bootleg books. That's the first thing that bothered me about the movie -- was there really no one else in Napoleonic France who could produce absurdly overwritten ...P>The characters are mostly devoid of nuance. Rush's de Sade is a one-note leering horndog. Winslet's virginal chambermaid appeals to both de Sade and Joaquin Phoenix's character, the repressed cleric who runs the asylum. I did like Phoenix's turn as the priest who is tolerant enough to become friends with de Sade; I thought his work in this movie was more subtle and interesting than in ""Gladiator"". Michael Caine is a humorless scientist (with torturous medical techniques) appointed as an ""advisor"" to the asylum to suppress de Sade's writing. Even the random assortment of asylum inmates seem like stock characters: the pyromaniac; the giant; the guy who thinks he's a bird.
""Quills"" reminds me strongly of two other movies. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is, to me, a far better look at a free spirit trapped in an asylum that is trying to repress him. The other is ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", another movie which takes the side of the pornographer as the system tries to censor him. ...; in this movie de Sade is portrayed as a wickedly sexual but mostly harmless producer of satirical smut that appeals to everyone but the repressed elite. In real life, de Sade was famous for torturing women and is the inspiration for the term ""sadism"".
I wanted to like ""Quills"" but the snippets of de Sade's writing we are given are absurd and sometimes funny but not really erotic, and while I agree with the anti-censorship theme of the movie, it is not presented in an interesting or thoughtful manner. It's more like a Rodney Dangerfield snobs-vs.-slobs movie where the lower classes are all titillated by de Sade's stories and the upper classes can only shudder and try to squash him. I think ""Quills"" would fit better as a theater production, where the interactions between de Sade and his captors might be more interesting, but the story just doesn't seem ""big"" enough to merit a whole movie. The vast majority of the movie takes place in the asylum, a lot of it in de Sade's cell, and as it played out to its inevitable resolution there just wasn't anything in the way of scenery, character development or originality to keep me interested. I'd instead recommend ""Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""Larry Flynt"", or ""Elizabeth"" if you want to see Geoffrey Rush in period garb.",1013990400,,2831,4.827160493827161
1327435,4,B00003CXPV,"Geoffrey Rush, Joaquim Phoenix, Kate Winslet and Michael Caine are all excellent in this film about the last days of the Marquis de Sade's life. Rush brings the Marquis to life as the lecherous writer imprisoned for writing lurid and perverted materials. The books were outlawed, but illegal copies circulated. The problem, in fact, was that while the Marquis was imprisoned, his books were still being written, still being smuggled out of the prison and published. He was aided in his quest to be published by one of the women working in the prison (Kate Winslet), who smuggled his works out with the laundry. The lengths to which the Marquis eventually goes in order to write (writing his works on his sheets with red wine, writing with his own feces on the walls) are both ludicrous and extraordinary. Joaquim Phoenix plays the sympathetic priest who tries to negotiate with the Marquis, trying to get him to tone down his eccentricities in exchange for the luxuries the priest allows the Marquis to have. When word of the Marquis's perverted books is publicised, scandal ensues and a sadistic ""mental health professional""(Michael Caine)  is sent to ""cure"" the Marquis of his ills.

1327492,5,B00003CXPV,"To say that Quills, Philip Kaufmann's newest work, is a film about censorship, deviant sexuality, or ill-fated inter-relationships would be, at best, icing on the cake.  The fact of the matter is, Quills offers us one of the rare, cherished instances where Hollywood's faint renegade impulse surfaces to challenge the status quo.  Quills addresses the unquestionable sanctity of ""morality"", the privileged position granted to ""science"" over art, and the hollow cliches with which much of the film industry's productions are replete (happy resolutions, lucid distinctions between personnas, etc.)  What we have here is a deceptively simple yet layered event that engages a character grossly misrepresented by history and conventional perspectives.  Geoffrey Rush brings the necessary elegance, wit and command of language that one would expect of the Marquis de Sade, a crafty non-compliant 18th century aristocrat who lived through three regimes and was rejected by them all, not only for his pornographic literature, but for his unrelenting criticism of the decadence of religion and other social institutions.  Joaquim Phoenix does justice to his role as the Abbe de Cloumier, a man torn between passion and righteousness, piety and curiosity.  His solid demeanour throughout the film makes for a great follow-up to his part in the Gladiator. Kate Winslett also delivers an endearing performance as the sneaky and mischievous chambermaid who helps the Marquis ""spread his insiduous gospel"" by smuggling his manuscripts to a mysterious messenger who in turn takes them to an urban press.  She is the thread that charmingly runs through the film binding the Marquis and Abbe's destinies with her own.  And lastly, Michael Caine's stately presence as Dr. Royer-Collard provides the consummating quality of a film worthy to claim its perch with the most revered historical dramas.
  One of the strengths of the film is the multiple dimensions of the principle characters.  Instead of residing singular values and personnas in each particular character, Kaufmann complicates the film by endowing each character with disparate and conflicting tendencies.  The lines between good and evil not only blur, but we are left to ponder their very existence in the aesthetic and polemical sense.  The film's unseemly twists and turns whet not only our curiosity about the Marquis de Sade and the social and political realities of 18/19 century France, but it also serves as a treatise on the hypocrisy and perils of ""moral crusading"".  The film also brings a lofty, but welcome, message to the individual who seeks reprieve from the restraints of expectation, if only for the moment.
  The film does take some liberties with the subject matter but this is hardly a liability.  Quills is every bit art as it is ""fact"", if not more so. It is not academic history nor is it an accurate biography. It does not feign to be either.  It is a film, however, that features valuable social insights as well as counter-cultural criticism and themes.  Perhaps this is the strength of all transhistorical films: the ability to reflect and satirise immediate circumstances, flavouring them with historical topics and backgrounds.  Quills ""merely holds up a mirror and apparently some will not like what they see"".  Granted.  But that is the ""peril of creating such incendiary films.""",1008806400,7,3357,5.258911819887429

1327496,4,B00003CXPV,"It's post-revolutionary France.  Napoleon is in power.  The Age of Enlightenment is in full swing, yet the remnants of the Dark Ages still linger to restrain the thinking of many a powerful monarch, religious leader and rank-and-file common citizen.  In all areas of life, the barriers to freedom and self-expression are rapidly giving way, leaving traditional institutions and values fighting for their very survival.  And this includes that most sensitive of all areas, the one that has, perhaps, caused more consternation for the race than any other in our history - determining the role that sexuality plays in defining who we are physically, emotionally and spiritually.  Long thought of as little more than a necessary evil, sexuality is suddenly starting to be reexamined in the light of other scientific and academic reassessments.  Small wonder that at such a crucial moment in mankind's sexual awakening, a figure like the Marquis De Sade would emerge, a man whose name has since become synonymous with perversion, deviancy and licentiousness.  It is this epic struggle between religion and nature for the soul of humanity that Philip Kaufman captures so brilliantly in his wickedly perverse, mordantly witty and brilliantly acted film, ""Quills.""
Director Kaufman, working from a screenplay by Doug Wright (based on his play of the same name), chooses to start his tale almost at its end - at the period when De Sade was already wasting away in an insane asylum, considered too perverted and dangerous in his ideas to be allowed to run loose among the general populace.  Yet, it's hard to keep a creative genius down - and De Sade has, unbeknownst to the priest who runs the facility, been regularly smuggling out manuscripts to publishers on the outside, much to the chagrin and delight of many elements of the French public.  One of those least amused is Napoleon himself, who decides that he must take action in silencing this reprobate once and for all.  He decides to send a ""specialist"" in mental health - one Dr. Royer-Collard, a man more in tune with the techniques of the Spanish Inquisition than of modern medicine - to take charge and bring De Sade to his senses.  Wright's and Kaufman's other two main characters include the priest, The Abbe du Coulmier, who is keeper of the institution, and Madeleine LeClerc, a beautiful young devotee of De Sade's work who serves both as laundress and chief smuggler for the author and his works.
In many ways, the most interesting conflict turns out to be the one between De Sade and the Abbe, two men seemingly antipodes apart yet somehow able to find a common ground of mutual respect and understanding.  On the one hand, we have a man who has completely thrown away all sexual inhibitions and indeed lives to not only experience every possible sexual pleasure but to encourage others to do so as well.  On the other hand, we have a man who has chosen a life of chastity and celibacy, opting to completely shut down the sexual aspect of his life as a pious sublimation to God - and yet neither extreme seems normal, healthy or practicable.  In fact, near the end, De Sade suffers the torment of realizing that someone he cares for very deeply has become a tragic victim of one of his ""ideas"" run amuck, just as the Abbe, after years of repression, finds himself inching ever closer to the insanity that he is supposed to be curing in others.
Interestingly, the Abbe, the representative of the church that held the world in the grip of the Dark Ages for so long, is actually a beacon of enlightened reason compared to Dr. Royer-Collard, the self-ascribed ""Man of Science.""  Here is an individual actually aligned with the Church's Medieval methods, inflicting any form of excruciating physical and psychological torture on his patients to achieve their ultimate ""cure"" - though we can see by the way he subtly abuses his own sixteen year old wife that ""power"" is, as always, the world's strongest aphrodisiac.
Special not must be taken of the superb performances by Geoffrey Rush, Joaquin Phoenix, Michael Caine and Kate Winslet.  Each does a superb job in bringing these diverse and complex characters to vivid life.
In terms of art direction, costume design and cinematography, the filmmakers do a fantastic job in recreating this strange world of the past - capturing that startling admixture of piety and licentiousness that bespeaks the ""dual nature in Man,"" which has forever served as the basis for the epic struggle between religion and nature.  In a world like the one we live in now - in which explicit pornography has found a comfortable and, indeed, quite lucrative niche - De Sade seems ever more a man ahead of his time.  It was his misfortune to be born into a world not quite ready to accept the ideas he had to offer.  Had he been living in this century, perhaps we would never even have heard of the name De Sade at all.  Perhaps he would be just another anonymous pornographer, using the camera rather than the written word to graphically illustrate his darkest sexual longings.  Then again, who knows?  Perhaps it would be he who founded a world famous magazine and set up a mansion dedicated solely to the propagation of male sexual pleasure.  It is, in the face of ""Quills,"" a thought worth pondering.",1004832000,6,5284,4.827242524916944

The snippets of purple pornography we hear in narration , and the asylum inmates bawdy representations of them, are very funny, in a dark and twisted way.  Apparently, the fun was too good to last.  Although a darkening was inevitable, I feel it was a bit to heavy, and too soon coming. It was also not entirely clear what the final point was meant to be.  The film failed to stay realistic within the boundaries it had set for itself at the beginning.  The climactic scene seemed a little over the top, and the ending, while ironic, was almost too clever for its own good.

Quills is a dark, sadistic and brilliant film right from the very first opening shot, where Geoffrey Rush's voice narrates in the background and we open on a shot of a young lady who is known in town only as a down-right whore and she is decapitated. Then we find out this is just one of Marquis' stories, and we are already into the story of the film. Quills is a film that literally bursts out of the screen with its energy and intrigue, it is a film that feels like you are actually there, experiencing the traumas or happy moments. I felt like I was the Marquis De Sade dancing on the table or writing with my own blood, or like I was Madeline being strapped continuously and been totally engrossed by the Marquis' stories. Unlike some other period dramas, this film is never boring. It always has something going on and you'll find it hard to look away from the screen. I just loved everything about the movie - especially the performances. Geoffrey Rush is a master at this kind of thing. He becomes the Marquis De Sade and I looked at the screen and truly thought it was actually the character. You can't see Geoffrey Rush's acting. He acts in the film naked a lot and puts all of his effort into the making his performance a success. A truly great actor, and a brilliant performance. Kate Winslet also gets naked once again, but we find out there is more to her than a pretty face and a big bust. Joaquin Phoenix is always he always is - strong, real and totally awesome to watch. Phoenix invests his character extremely. He gives a truly memorable performance. Michael Caine was also very good as the villain type guy, but I don't think we saw enough of him. Philip Kaufman's direction is outstanding. He has come up with an excellent film and his effort is truly stupendous. There were some scenes I thought were truly astounding. The play ""The Crimes of Love"" is hilarious and shows off how much The Marquis De Sade mocks people with his absolute truth. The scenes near the end, including one stunning one when a statue cries blood, are all extremely well directed but I don't want to ruin the end for viewers who haven't seen this film. The script for this movie was dark, funny, literal, intelligent and endlessly intriguing. Kudos, Doug Wright. You wrote an awesome play and a better movie. This movie is controversial, brutal and has a lot of rape, violence, language and particularly revealing sex scenes, but it is all worth it. This movie gets a place in my top 50 favourites.

1327500,5,B00003CXPV,"What a brutal, rough, cruel, magical, eye-opening, passionate masterpiece. Not easy on the eyes, I'll warn you. Not easy on conservatives, I'll also warn you.
  The Marquis de Sade (Rush) is living at the Chareton Asylum, and is sneaking is books out by way of Madeleine (Winslet). They're doing this unbeknownst to the Abbe Coulmier (Phoenix). Soon, a doctor (Caine) arrives to silence the Marquis, and all hades breaks loose.
  Geoffrey Rush is magnetic on the screen. You can't take your eyes off of him, not counting his numerous nude scenes.
  Kate Winslet is naive and lovely, seductive and innocent. She's a perfect paradox.
  Michael Caine is a bit too card-boardish for playing the villain, but that's what he had to work with.
  And Joaquin Phoenix is...beautiful. That's the only way I can describe it. Physically, emotionally, subtly, the guy is gorgeous. I can't believe that A) they chose his Gladiator performance (good, but not quite to this level) over this one for nomination, and B) they probably still would've given it to Benicio Del Toro even if Phoenix was nominated for this. His eyes show more emotion and passion than words or facial expression could. You've also gotta give him and Rush props for their sexual bravery. If you've seen the film, you know what I mean.
  The costumes suit each character extremely well. Sade looks all the more devilish in his off-white suits, Madeleine (Winslet) is the perfect-looking chambermaid, the Abbe is the sexist priest you'll ever see in his cassock, and the good doctor Collard looks imposing in his black.

Kate does not show up totally naked as she often does in her movies. Jeff does, if you count careful camera angles. Bummer! So to speak. Kate, excellent actress that she is, is still worth the price.

1327553,4,B00003CXPV,"This tale of the supression and imprisonment of the Marquis De Sade in the insane asylum at Charenton and the ensuing struggle and turmoil caused by the arrival of Dr. Royer-Collard to stop his smuggled-out writings from being published has much to recommend it, especially in the first half of the film. Chiefly the performances of Jeffrey Rush as De Sade, Joaquin Phoenix as the caring and humane Abbe Coulmier in charge of Charenton, and Kate Winslet as the sympathetic laundress, Madeleine, who is smuggling the manuscripts for fun and profit.
This De Sade is a monster of sorts, not so much of depravity, as of vanity and selfishness & self-obsession. He is compelled to write at any cost, and is by turns clever and obnoxious and self-destructive and indifferent to anything or anyone but his own need for self-expression. Well-played by Rush, he is a reminder that art mustn't be confused with the artist--terrible people can create beauty. In this instance, the art of De Sade may not be beautiful and may not even be ""art"" to most minds, but the need to create is real and just as valid with bad art as with genius and must be protected.
Winslet and Phoenix present foils for De Sade in the forms of, by turns,  an enticing virgin intrigued by and intriguing with the Marquis and a conflicted man of the cloth enjoying the intellectual challenge of the man while protecting and seeing to his care. Both are fine.
Alas, we come to the fourth character in this drama, the conservative Dr. Royer-Collard played by Michael Caine. A bureaucrat and a closet sadist, before the name had become attached to the behavior (bit of irony there), he is such a villain that he only lacks a long black moustache to twirl. I won't fault Caine because I imagine he's playing him as written, and, especially in one scene at a door in the Apocalyptic finale I felt expected to hiss & boo him. The finale was a bit much as well.
But it is the Caine character that brings the movie down to my mind. It is too much an obvious and cheap shot. The mendacious conservative. It would have been so much more interesting had the character not been so one-dimensional in his evil. When we first are introduced to him, Dr. Royer-Collard looked to be interesting: a true believer in his own nutty cures (soaking madmen upside down to calm them) so I had hopes of an exploration of two halves of crazy extremes, the libertine (De Sade) and the orthodox conservative, the incendiary & the politician. Both monsters & madmen in their own ways. Well, you won't find it here. What you get is beknighted artist and slimy bad guy.  Cliches. Also, the subplot of Royer-Collard's young wife is a wasted & unnecessary plot device, no more.
What you will find is some extreme behaviour from Rush in a good, but at times mannered performance, [an incomplete] defense of art at any cost, a penny-dreadful villain, some nice honest performances from the younger set (Winslet & Phoenix), a fiery finale that is over-the-top and a bit silly, and an ending that is not a twist or surprise but wants to be. Snappy dialogue isn't enough to carry the day.
Yet, Phil Kaufman is too intelligent and talented a director to make a boring film, and this isn't one. The production values are great and this is a film at least about SOMETHING, and there are ideas afloat here. While I think it ultimately didn't convince me, it is a worthy effort. Probably 3-1/2 stars.",999388800,4,3420,4.632619439868204
1327554,3,B00003CXPV,"I would recommend this movie to people who love literature and history. The casting, acting, costuming and staging was wonderful. The story is about the Marquis de Sade who tries to sell his controversial writing to the public even though he himself is indisposed. An altogether sensational movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Geoffrey Rush did a great job in the role of the Marquis, his acting was superb.",999302400,,419,4.7534246575342465
1327555,4,B00003CXPV,"One thing I can say about Kate Winslet is that she not afraid to take on controversial and demanding roles. In ""Quills"" she plays a laundress in the mental hospital where the Marquis de Sade is imprisoned. Geoffrey Rush is cast as the demented and perverse Marquis who has an obsession with writing down his violent and sado-masochistic stories. He therefore needs quills to write with and, when they are forcibly taken away, he must discover other ways to tell his stories. Joaquin Phoenix gives a fine performance as a priest who tries understand the Marquis and who is himself pulled into the insanity around him. And Michael Caine is cast as a pompous doctor whose methods of cure are as sick and perverse as the insane Marquis.
Set in 18th century France, and costumed well, the scene is set for a weird historical drama which is in itself perverse and sick... so perverse in fact that I found myself retching in disgust. Although some of the sex scenes are bawdy and humorous, it's the scenes of pain and torture that linger in my mind. But, after all, what can you expect from a film about the Marquis de Sade? Frankly, I'm not one to turn away from violence, but this film is a bit much, even for me. I therefore recommend it only to the very few who might be intrigued by the concept.

1327557,3,B00003CXPV,"I probably haven't seen a movie that personally repulsed me this much since Ken Russell's ""The Devils.""  In all honesty I can't say that it isn't well acted, well written and well directed.  Ordinarily that is more than enough for me.  However, I don't need the point of freedom of artistic expression hammered home to me in such nauseating detail.  Rush as the Marquis de Sade needs to keep writing his erotica but faces repression at every turn is the essence of the plot.  He will thus use anything (as pen, ink and paper) and anyone.  Kate Winslet as the virginal laundress, who is enthralled by his work and lured into his web, is up to her usual excellence.

Joaquin Phoenix, as the priest in charge of this facility of possible madmen, shows once again that he can salvage just about any movie single handedly.  Michael Caine is unfortunately wasted as the doctor seeking to repress de Sade. His is the most predictible and hackneyed part.  If thoroughly repulsing the viewer is the test of acting talent, and I can see where it is arguable that it might be, Geoffrey Rush succeeds beyond measure.  If you have a stronger stomach than mine, you may well love this film.

1327561,3,B00003CXPV,"Don't get me wrong. I generally love period pieces. I did not love this one, as I found it to be too depressing, though marvelously acted by a stellar cast. Most of the film takes place in an insane asylum which houses the Marquis de Sade.

Geoffrey Rush is marvelous and shines (no pun intended) as the Marquis de Sade, whom he plays as a deliciously salacious, old reprobate with a highly droll sense of humor. Joaquin Phoenix deftly plays the part of the young Abbe Coulmier, a tortured soul who is trying to fulfill his duties as a priest, while trying to resist his attraction to the virginal asylum laundress, Madeleine, beautifully acted by the earthy and talented Kate Winslet. Michael Caine plays the part of the evil Dr. Royer-Collard, who assumes control of the asylum, after Napolean becomes incensed at the licentiousness of the prose being published by the asylum's high profile inmate.

The story takes place in France at the turn of the eighteenth century in the gothic and forbidding Charenton asylum in which the notorious Marquis de Sade resides as an inmate. The asylum is run by Abbe Coulmier, who oversees the asylum with a gentle hand and believes that self-expression through artistic venues prevents the inmates from acting out those behaviors which got them sent to the asylum in the first place. It seems a serene, almost idyllic, well run place, with a relatively contented population.

Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of the Marquis is brilliant, and he makes the most of the often witty dialogue which the screenplay has provided. As a slightly rumpled member of the nobility, he lives in the asylum in faded splendor, writing  sexual fantasies that he may no longer act out. Secretly assisted by the laundress, Madeleine, who ensures that his bawdy, sexually explicit, salacious stories reach a publisher, his prose becomes the toast of France, whose citizens eagerly await a new offering by the Marquis. His published story, ""Justine"", is ultimately read to the Emperor Napoleon, who decides that the asylum needs someone who will quell the Marquis.

Enter Dr. Royer-Collard, a doctor given to the use of an Iron Maiden and a water dunking apparatus to ""cure"" those unfortunate, disaffected ,and mentally ill individuals who come under his ""care"". It is he who is sent to the asylum and ultimately wrests control from the beleagered Abbe Coulmier, who is wrestling with his own demons and does not, at first, see what is coming down the pike.

Under Dr. Royer-Collard's administration, the asylum undergoes a change. It becomes more repressive. The more repressive it becomes, however, the more the Marquis demands to be heard. The more he demands to be heard, the more repressive the asylum becomes. It becomes a vicious cycle, with issues of power and control dominating.
Invariably, the Marquis rebels against this repression,. His rebellion initially manifests itself by tweaking the doctor. The Marquis tweaks him once too many times, however, and in a most public fashion. This incurs the doctor's wrath. As the doctor gains total control of the asylum, sadistic practices mask themselves as treatment. This, however, does not stop Madeleine from doing all she can to get the Marquis' writings to his adoring public, to her ultimate dismay.

The Marquis continues to write, even as his  paper, quills, and ink, are removed, resorting to using using wine, blood, and even feces to write on sheets, his clothing, and the walls which imprison him. He simply will not be silenced.
Meanwhile, the good Abbe Coulmier is out of his league. Torn by his love and desire for Madeleine, as well as by his own impotence in the face of Dr. Royer-Collard's policies and practices, he begins his own seeming descent into madness. When he finally realizes that the bland and benign countenance of the doctor hides a malignancy greater than that which he had encountered among the inmates of the asylum, it is far too late.

The film is really an allegory, and there it succeeds brilliantly. As entertainment, however, I found it to be too dark and depressing to fully enjoy it.",994550400,3,4093,4.9375

The acting from everyone is fabulous and without flaw (although I could have lived without seeing Geoffrey Rush naked.)

1327603,4,B00003CXPV,"Philip Kaufman has been known for his risque material; it was his ""Henry & June"" that made the MPAA bring out the now-dreaded NC-17 certificate. With ""Quills"", whose uneasy mix of sauciness, dark satire and Gothic horror landed it in hot water with audiences and Academy voters, Kaufman arrests the audience's attention with sumputous and disturbing visuals, elaborating on the dangers inherent with speaking one's mind as well as their pleasures.
The film was shot mostly at Shepperton Studios, England, and it shows. The sets of Charenton Asylum are beautiful in their Gothic mastery, with exteriors serving their seductive purposes also. Costumes are absolutely wonderful too (check out the 'suit-turned-manuscript' on Geoffrey Rush's Sade). For the eyes, ""Quills"" is an absolute treat; for the brain, also, Doug Wright's script is full of witty wordplay at the expense of some of the history, but spends a bit too much time with Michael Caine's hypocritical-but-boring Royer-Collard. Passionate performances all round help immensely: Geoffrey Rush is nothing short of fantastic and brave and it is criminal how Kate Winslet didn't receive an Oscar nomination for her beautiful performance. Joaquin Phoenix follows up his Oscar nomination in ""Gladiator"" with a subtle turn too, hinting at a perversity that could very well match Rush's demented Sade, sharing a certain chemistry with Rush in a few scenes.

When we are open, we consider an idea with a view to adopting it, modifying it, or rejecting it. The one thing we will not do is prevent others from considering it. The one option an open mind never chooses is censorship, for the open mind is not afraid of an idea.
Set during Sade's final incarceration at Charenton, Quills is a fine fable of the horrendous physical consequences that can follow when people are afraid of ideas. Joaquin Phoenix as the enlightened abb who finally reverts to authoritarianism as the pressure rises, Kate Winslet, and Michael Caine give strong supporting performances. Geoffrey Rush's brilliant portrayal of Sade ranges from salacious good humor to outrage at the ongoing efforts to silence him and defiant anguish as the means of writing are successively taken away.

1327608,2,B00003CXPV,"Anti-censorship films have a tendency to be blustering and obvious. In part this is because the issue of censorship is presently such a straw man and all involved must resort to a sort of cinematic McCarthyism: reduce the conservatives to closeted sadists, give the hero a sort of puerile charm (say Howard Stern meets Henry Miller), and dress it up as important social commentary. I don't disagree with their intentions, but I'm always troubled by how facile the final product is. Quills is a good example of this.
The misunderstood Marquis, foil and faux-savior for so many crusading intellectuals, is here reduced to something of a naughty pulp writer. We are of course never allowed to get to the really nasty bits of his imagination. Instead we get innocent jokes about lubrication and de Sade's erectile state. He's not the fearsome evil beast we know, he's morning radio material for third-tier American markets.
Because the film is more about the message than the art form, plot twists are seen miles away. Thus Royer-Collard takes his nubile bride from a convent. Shame. If he had read some of his famed patient's material he might have saved himself the trouble. For as we know, only licentious nuns with hidden stores of vibrating crucifixes can be found there.
But it's the simplification of character and motive that troubles me the most. By making Caine's character into such a devil, all possible moral ambiguity is obliterated. I think this is a disservice to the very cause the film crusades for. To make caricatures of the opposition does not allow for intelligent judgment when weighing issues of social responsibility and artistic license. Instead, it reduces us to the same reactionary state that we condemn.",992736000,13,1729,4.986159169550173
1327609,3,B00003CXPV,"Fine as the casting was, and pitched though the atmosphere, Quills disappointed me. (Then again, I don't think I've seen a single movie that *hasn't* disappointed me since the late 90s sometime.) I suppose it just has to be expected that any film made about the Marquis De Sade is going to portray him as some kind of sleek, crafty, over-the-top devil, as opposed to the girlish, cowardly (though hardly uninteresting) fat man I've been given to understand that he was, and is going to milk those (to me, somewhat tiresome) ""What is Art?"" and ""Where is the line between Madness and Genius?"" kinds of questions.
But in fairness the film must be evaluated on its own merits. And it certainly has a few of them. Much as I would like to see De Sade portrayed at least a touch more *accurately* on film, Rush is a talented actor, and his performance here leaves little to complain about. Phoenix particularly impressed me as the compassionate but confused Abbe who attempts to juggle being a friend to the Marquis while remaining a devout man of God. Winslet, Caine, and the rest of the supporting cast all fare nicely, too.
However, I very much would've liked to have seen the dynamics between the various players developed in greater detail. I wanted to really believe Winslet's maid was longing for Phoenix, and that Phoenix was battling his own attraction to her. I wanted to witness the Marquis encourage and use that to his advantage. I wanted Caine to play more prominently into the story, and I wanted to see a little more of his young bride's transformation and rebellion against him.
It also would've been nice to see the Marquis *before* he was an inmate, maybe through some extended flashbacks or something, just to pull the reins on the cackling, sinister scoundrel/liberator/martyr schtick. I would've like to have seen more evidence that he was in fact a man, with a past.
Also, well-played though the characters are, their actions do not always ring true. I certainly found Phoenix's ... um ... so as not to spoil, let's say, his disturbing scene with Winslet towards the end ... unbelievable. I understood he was struggling and tortured by what had happened to her, but it just didn't ring true that he'd be sinking that low. It was an unsettling scene, but it should've been earned, if it wanted to be truly powerful -- and I don't think it was (earned, or powerful. Just kind of cheaply ""shocking."")
All in all, I guess the simplest way to put it would be that I just wanted more from the movie. Quite a bit more. Like so very many movies of the past five to ten years, Quills is a film which tries hard to raise a lot of important questions, while forgetting and/or neglecting to include an actual, fleshed-out *story.*
Raise the questions it does, and well-acted it is. The sets are captivating and the visual design is nice. But Quills, though hardly unengaging or unworthy of viewing, leaves more than a little to be desired.
Ah, yes, and I'd almost forgotten. The very ending is incredibly laugh-out-loud stupid. Groan-worthy. One of those cheap, gimmick, ""Do you get it??? Hunh?? Do you get what we're saying?? Do you see how clever we are??"" kind of endings. It really should've been cut or altered.",992563200,4,3220,4.690812720848056
1327610,4,B00003CXPV,"Geoffrey Rush gives the performance of the year in ""Quills"", director Philip Kaufman's probing film into the questions of morality and censorship using the infamous French writer the Marquis de Sade (Rush). Rush doesn't play the Marquis, he IS the Marquis. The lecherous sneer when he is around women, the self-satisfied humming as he begins to write, the uncontrollable sobs in the midst of personal tragedy; watching Rush, one gets the feeling of watching de Sade, the man himself, not just the character.
Kate Winslet is luminous as ever as Madeleine, the chambermaid who smuggles the Marquis' writings to a publisher. Her delight in his words, juxtaposed with her sweet innocence and purity, are a delicate balance that Winslet pulls off well.
Contributing a remarkable performance is Joaquin Phoenix as the abbe who oversees the asylum to which de Sade has been committed. The conflicts of duty, faith, and love ever apparent in his eyes, Phoenix (""Gladiator"") further demonstrates that he is an accomplished young actor on the rise.

Worth seeing for Rush's and Phoenix's fine performances, the period decor, and the cinematography, if nothing else.

1327661,4,B00003CXPV,"&#8220;Quills&#8221; was a grotesque, yet intriguing flick.  You've probably read about the detail of the plot and acting in other reviews, so I'll skip right over that stuff.
What intrigued me most about &#8220;Quills&#8221; was its political message.  Yes, it's about censorship, but it's more specific than that, too.  It's also a commentary on the current nature of politics and the recent attempts from the conservative sectors of the nation to attack Hollywood for its production of violent and sexual material.
The Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) writes the filthy material.  In the film, he's seen as a genius; his work liberates his readers from the repression of the period (and of this one, too).  (After all, the buxom maid, Madeline &#8211; Kate Winslet &#8211; is able to release her suppressed passion for the Abbe through the Marquis' writings.)  He's the artist, insane, reviled, locked away.
Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) is the right-wing politician/party functionary and censor.  He arrives at the asylum with strict orders from the Emperor Napoleon to stop the writings of de Sade. Dr. Royer-Collard's true intentions become manifest as the film progress:  he seeks to control the asylum itself, and exploit it for his own profit.  The Marquis only offers a tool by which he can leverage control away from the asylum's proprietor, the Abbe Colmier.
Abbe Colmier (Joaquin Phoenix) is the liberal, the humanist.  Filled with good intentions and a firm belief in God and goodness, he runs the asylum with a compassionate touch.  He encourages the inmates to take up the arts of singing, acting, and &#8211; in de Sade's case &#8211; writing, in belief that these activities help quell the demonic lunacy of the inmates.  He has no ulterior motive, other than to comfort his fellow humans.
Dr. Royer-Collard is quickly seen as a hypocrite.  He attacks de Sade for his immoral writings, yet lives an immoral life, having purchased a 14-year old orphan girl for a wife from a nunnery, and proceeds to bar her door and window and rape her at night.  Caine's character distinctly evokes the shameless hypocrisy of modern-day Republican Congressmen Gingrich and Hyde, who attacked the President for marital infidelities despite their own sordid and unfaithful histories.
And the Abbe is a political naf.  He never discerns the Dr's Machiavellian intentions and allows the Dr. to snatch away the asylum and ruin him in the process.  He never even suspects the Dr's motives, and believes everything told him implicitly.  Again, this behavior resembles the current-day Democrats as they stand mutely by while the younger Bush tramples the electoral process and the environment and sells out California to the energy companies that contributed heavily to his campaign.
The movie is clearly a warning to the political left in the U.S.  ....",991612800,7,2851,5.134199134199134

What impressed me most, though, were the performances of Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix.  I was extremely underwhelmed by each of them in their performances in the box office spectaculars Titanic and Gladiator, respectively.  Here I was spellbound by each of their portrayals and would now place them in the first rank of contemporary performers.  Working with less one dimensional material, each of these artists shows a particularly great ability to act with depth and authenticity.  In fact, their performances both compare favorably with that by Michael Caine (in a lesser role), who is certainly one of the finest of his profession.

1327700,5,B00003CXPV,"Ah yes the Marquis de Sade--a poor fellow who will forever be interpreted poorly in film.  At least that was what I thought until I watched the movie Quills.  This movie is excellent.
The story starts off simply enough.  The Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) is locked away in an insane asylum.  There he is looked after by the resident priest (Joaquin Phoenix).  Sade is compelled to write during his stay at the asylum and his perverse and erotic literature is smuggled out to publishers by a laundry maid (Kate Winslet).  After the writing is published it causes royalty of France much unhappiness.  So in response to the Marquis' words a harsh doctor (Michael Caine) is sent to the asylum to get things in order and shut the Marquis up--however not everything goes as planned.
This movie is filled with witty erotic humor that will make anyone laugh and drama that could make anyone cry.  Rush's acting is so superb as the Marquis.  He gives such an incredible performance showing the Marquis travels deeper into madness.  Winslet comes off splendidly as a laundry maid.  This movie re-establishes that Winslet is a good actress.  Caine and Phoenix's performaces are also extremely well acted.  I honestly feel there could not have been a better cast.  However, a great cast does not automatically make a great movie--It also takes fabulous direction, scripting, costumes, cinematography and much more--all of which Quills has.
If you are looking for a guilty pleasure movie, a humorous movie, a dramatic movie, a great movie--then please check out Quills.",990748800,3,1558,4.9423076923076925

The thing that got me about the film was the endless debauchery, with no other depth. The Marquis de Sade had an infinitely dirty mind, like he couldn't ponder anything other than really dirty and violent sex. I've met people like this (you know who you are), but I don't hang out with them and I don't enjoy their company. That's the main reason I didn't enjoy the movie all that much.
I've heard it described as having a conversation with an intelligent person, when they are constantly swearing. It was like that. I'm sure that it's probably not that big a deal with most people, but for me, it ruined the movie experience.",990662400,,828,4.453947368421052
1327703,5,B00003CXPV,"This is a terrific film about the infamous Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush), who wrote pornography from his cell in a mental institution and smuggled it out to be published to the delight of Napoleonic France.  The story is brilliantly written by Doug Wright, who also wrote the play upon which the film is based.  The rapid-fire dialogue is intelligent and biting and the humor is delightfully nasty and ironic.
Philip Kaufman's direction is excellent.  The pace is exceptionally good and he brings out inspired performances from the entire cast.  The period is well rendered without excessive flourishes.  The costumes are appropriate, but not overly ornate as would be expected of the characters (Jacqueline West was nominated for an Oscar for best costume design for this film).  Kaufman allows the characters to dominate the images rather than trying to insert slick effects and stylish perspectives, a definite plus in this film.
The story is a dark and twisted examination of the Marquis and his relationship with the Abbe Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), who runs the asylum, Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine), who is sent by Napoleon to keep the Marquis under control, and Madeleine (Kate Winslet), who helps him to smuggle his bawdy manuscripts to the publisher.  Despite all their efforts to keep the Marquis from writing, he always outwits them and produces another ""masterpiece"".  The scene where he puts on a play about Royer-Collard and his child bride is hysterical, with the mirthful invective coming so fast that you have to rewind it a couple of times to fully appreciate it.
As good as Geoffrey Rush was in ""Shine"", I thought he was even better here.  Rush is electrifying, playing an extremely complex character on the very brink of insanity.  He plays the role like a man possessed, and ranges from wickedly funny to frighteningly frenzied.  His performance was nominated for the Oscar for best actor that went to Russell Crowe for ""Gladiator"".  Both were deserving of the prize, and it is a pity one of them had to walk away empty handed.
Joaquin Phoenix (who ironically co-starred with both best actor nominees, and was nominated himself for best supporting actor for ""Gladiator""), turns in another fine performance as the Abbe, and continues to prove himself one of the up and coming dramatic actors of his generation.  Kate Winslet emerges from her self-imposed banishment to obscurity (""Hideous Kinky"", ""Holy Smoke"") with a wonderfully rich performance in a supporting role.  No Winslet performance would be complete without at least one frontal nude scene, and this film is no different in that regard.  However, she also provides a well-acted portrayal of a very sympathetic character in Madeleine that makes one think that perhaps her Oscar nomination for ""Titanic"" wasn't a fluke.  Michael Caine, as always, is fabulous as the underhanded Dr. Royer-Collard.  Caine is a highly versatile actor, and he brings vibrancy to almost every role he plays.
This has my vote as one of the best films of 2000.  It opened in theaters in limited release, so many people are not familiar with it.  Now that it is in the rental market, perhaps it will find a larger audience.  It is splendidly directed, the acting is superb, and the writing is intelligent, darkly humorous and engaging.  I rated it a 10/10.  Though not a film that will have mass appeal, it is a delight for the uninhibited intellectual viewer.",990230400,13,3422,4.9982363315696645

It is a surreal, realistic journey into the world of the Marquis De Sade, brilliantly played by Geoffrey Rush. Director Philip Kaufman films ""Quills"" with elegant style and surreal brilliance, this movie reminded me of the great Spanish surrealist Luis Buuel, who ""Quills"" would make proud. The movie is visceral, chilling and shocking. Kaufman is not afraid to venture into the mind of Sade, into the realms of what he was writing. And Rush in his incredible performance shows us the tight-rope between madness and genius. He is charming and savage, vile and romantic, much like Sade's works. The photography and art direction can be hypnotic and the screenplay by Doug Wright is brilliant in its construction and complexity. ""Quills"" is also a look into the mirror with the characters. We see representations of the hypocrites who attack Sade and yet practice what he writes about behind closed doors and nice people who are restrained from even love because of who they are. ""Quills,"" though sometimes strong and gothic, also has touches of dark romanticism and passion. It speaks to the restrained spirit but also to the intellectual debater. It speaks to forbidden lust and to strong moral ground. ""Quills"" is a great film. It is insane, comic, perversely alluring, darkly romantic, and a great gothic tale.

1327706,1,B00003CXPV,"""Quills"" marks a milestone in the career of its director, Phillip Kaufman.  This is the first time he's made a bad - I mean, really bad film.  During the 70's and 80's he made some of the best American mainstream motion pictures: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978) demonstrated his ability to dress up an old sci-fi premise in modern chic; ""The Right Stuff"" (1983) was a wonderfully, boyishly enthusiastic celebration of the early days of the American space program while ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" (1988), his masterpiece, was probably the finest major film about sexuality since ""Last Tango in Paris.""
What all three of those films shared, in varying degrees, was Kaufman's sense of exhiliration of his characters' discovery and celebration of freedom - be it sexual or spiritual - from the binding conformity of the institutions (the US space program, Communist Czechslovakia) which encompass their lives.  Whether its the transient glory of whirling around the globe in a tin can or whirling around the room with a lover, Kaufman strives to convince his audience of the necessity of emotional transcendence - of breaking free of the barriers of one's existence.  His best films have a literate free-wheelingness that's a refreshing contrast to most big-budget Hollywood films.  There's a playful daring in them that's bracing.
Following two rather muddled films - the overwrought ""Henry and June"" (1990) and the almost-good ""Rising Sun"" (1993) - Kaufman made ""Quills"" as an examination of his favorite themes - artistic freedom, sexual liberation, and the repressiveness of institutions. Unfortunately, he's chosen the wrong subject and taken the wrong approach to the material.  The material is poorly thought out, it is underwritten, and ends up being very silly.
The film concerns the final years of the French author and libertine, the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814), as he rots away in an insane asylum.  Sade (Geoffrey Rush) is notorious for writing some of the most hideous and deviant literature in human history but Kaufman treats him as a free spirit shackled to his cell.  The selections from Sade's works are mild at best and don't convey the hideous sexual violence abundant in them. Kaufman's (and his scenarist, Douglas Wright's) Sade is slightly twisted Romantic - misunderstood and punished by a society that doesn't understand or appreciate his art.
Kaufman takes Wright's fundamental misconception of Sade and elaborates it with mountingly absurd mistakes.  The only people offended by Sade's works are the alsyum director the Abb de Columier (Joacquin Phoenix) and his Javert-like nemesis, a doctor sent by special command by Napoleon to cure Sade, Royer-Collard (Michael Caine). Kaufman quickly establishes that the Abb is repressed  - he harbors a secret lust for the full-bosomed laundry maid who sneaks Sade's writings out of the asylum (Kate Winslet) - and Royer-Collard is a sadistic hypocrite - he professes to uphold ""moral values"" while raping his child-bride and torturing the prisoners.
Kaufman provides no additional depth to these characters because they're straw-men set up to prove the point that Sade and his admirers are True To Themselves and Live According To Their Emotions and Celebrate Artistic Freedom while the authority figures are Repressed Control-Freaks Who Stifle Freedom.  And Sade is the agent of liberation. Both Winslet's character and the doctor's child-bride find in Sade's writing a source of sexual liberation that anyone who has any knowledge of his work would find appalling. (Sade's work almost consistently stressed the total submission of women at the hands of an all-powerful male libertines). And to make Sade a combination of Lord Byron and Alexander Comfort is really not to deal with Sade at all - its Sade as reconceptualized as an eccentric counter-cultural hero.  The danger that lurks in Sade's fiction is trivalized and rendered fairly harmless.
Kaufman compounds the problem by filming this ludicrous mess in the most earnest style possible - there isn't a trace of wit in the whole 2 hours.  Indeed, the film has the overwrought earnestness of a fledging filmmaker Out To Send The World A Message.
""Quills"" demonstrates that even intelligent filmmakers with open-minded views can really blow it when they try to force history to conform to them. ""Quills"" alternates between being boring and being risible but never once does it ground itself in anything like recognizable human experience.  Simone de Beauvoir once asked if we must burn Sade; perhaps not - but tomatoes at the screen is the pretty appropriate response here.",989798400,11,4613,5.216216216216216
1327707,5,B00003CXPV,"While I can't help but laugh at the fact they made the Marquis de Sade the central character in a story about artistic expression and sexual repression, I can understand why. Here is a man who wallowed in excess, seeming unconcerned with the weight of his decisions, his only escape and expression the very thing that caused his downfall. The Marquis de Sade was not a martyr for freedom of speech. He was a seriously disturbed individual whose callous disregard for mankind (he thought murder should be a privilage for the rich) was reflected in his writing. But here he is a curious old coot, with a marvelous sense of humor and a deeply hidden soft side. But Geoffrey Rush's performance makes it all easier to swallow. He is a brave actor (appearing completely nude in several scenes) who loves to portray wounded characters and he simply shines. Kate Winslet (likewise great and brave) plays the innocent laudry maid Madeleine who secretly sneaks the Marquis' writing out of the asylum where he is kept and into the arms of a publisher. When these writings reach the hands of Napoleon, the emperor sends an accomplished doctor, Royer Collard (the great Michael Caine), to silence him, undermining the authority of the asylum's resident priest (Joaquin Phoenix), who sees Sade as a creature who must be saved and who NEEDS to write in order to clean his soul. The film is filled with sexual energy, reaching certain points of eroticism that recall director Philip Kaufman's earlier masterpiece 'The Unbearable Lightness Of Being'. This is a beautiful film, nicely detailed and extremely playful. It is also dark and grisly, nothing too graphic yet certainly unsettling at times. I suppose, if nothing else, 'Quills' does stand as a 'freedom of speech' movie. I look at it as a film which simultaneously acknowledges our fasination with sex and spanks us for our dirty thoughts. But it ultimately reminds us that we all have a right to be heard and that everything has an audience. And if you've just finished watching this movie, well then thank you for helping me prove that point.",989280000,17,2085,4.859550561797753
1327708,5,B00003CXPV,"QUILLS tells the story of the infamous Marquis de Sade,  the author of vivid sexual novels in the time of Napoleon's reign as emperor.  Philip Kaufman has given us a film that not only tells the story of the madness behind the genius,  but also a look upon censorship and one man's fight to write his work.  The storyline concerns the Marquis(Geoffrey Rush,  Shine,  Shakespeare In Love),  confined to his asylum cell,  and whose writings he gives to a beautiful and kind laundry girl Madeleine(Kate Winslet,  Titanic,  Sense and Sensibility).  Madeleine gives the writing to a publisher who distributes them secretely. The book is taken by Emperor Napoleon,  whose informants believe is the work of the Marquis,  so he sends a professional doctor to oversee the asylum,  run by the kindly Abbe Coulmier(Joaquin Phoenix,  Gladiator,  The Yards).  Dr. Royer-Collard(Michael Caine,  The Cider House Rules,  Hannah and her Sisters) is a ruthless man whose idea of treatment is dumping the patient repeatedly in cold water for a time until he is well.  He has also taken a wife who is 30 years younger than he.  This story gets around to the Marquis,  who in turn writes a play which is a farce playing upon the situation of the doctor and his young wife.  This enrages the doctor,  and the Marquis is punished severely by losing his furniture,  clothes,  and most importantly, his quills for writing.  However,  he will stop at nothing to continue writing,  figuring out any way possible to write his works.

Two-time Oscar-Winner(Supporting Actor:  Hannah and her Sisters,  Cider House Rules) Michael Caine gives a fiery and fierce performance as Dr.  Royce.

1327757,3,B00003CXPV,"I had very strong reactions to this film, so that I honestly cannot say whether or not this is a very good movie or a very bad one.  It might be most accurate to say that there are things in it that are extraordinary, and that there are many, many elements that I profoundly disliked.
I should perhaps first point out, what others have also mentioned, that you will learn NOTHING about the life of the Marquis de Sade from watching this movie.  Ezra Pound once wrote of a book that it was so filled with errors that an errata slip should have been published as a companion volume.  It would take either a full length book or a documentary film to start untangling the historical errors.  The movie is, therefore, not a biopic, but a complete fiction whose central character is very loosely based on the Marquis de Sade.  The main historical point worth mentioning is that de Sade lived a long life and died in bed of natural causes, with full use of his oratorical faculties.
The virtues of the film are many.  One must begin with the look of the film.  The film garnered an Oscar nomination for art direction, and it was a nomination that was richly deserved.  There are a lot of ""period"" films, but few that will feel as realistic as this one.
Then one must proceed to the acting.  Geoffrey Rush was simply Geoffrey Rush.  I have often wondered if Rush has any limitations as an actor.  Every role I have seen him in he has played an apparent ease and familiarity that few of his contemporaries can achieve.  I wonder, in fact, if he might not deserve crowning as perhaps the best movie actor active today.  And all the rest of the cast was quite superb, from Kate Winslet to Joaquin Phoenix to the least of the asylums inmates.
My primary quibble with the film was that it was unnecessarily unpleasant.  I understand the irony involved in the completely sadistic treatment of the man whose name gave us the word, but it doesn't automatically translate into a likable plot.  Michael Caine's character was so simple and vicious and self-serving that he was almost a cartoon.  And his refusal to intervene in Kate Winslet's rather brutal murder was too nasty to be believable.
This movie is most definitely not for the squeamish.  There is much maiming, blood, and explicit sexuality.  I will add that the movie doesn't try to make de Sade out as a great artist.  Virtually anyone who has attempted to read him will sound the same criticism of his work that most others have:  he is boring, his sex scenes (of which there are thousands) are decidedly unsexy and unerotic, that he describes act after act of the worst kinds of mutilation and violence, and that his characters are cardboardish and unbelievable.  Susan Sontag pointed out that Justine in the novel bearing her name is inexplicably just as shocked the 300th time that she was raped as the first time.  The movie certainly doesn't want to argue with this depiction of Sade as a poor though popular writer.  Geoffrey Rush's de Sade has a compulsion to write, but this does not mean that he writes well.
I think how much one likes this movie depends on how well they can deal with the unpleasant elements.  I did not deal with them well, and as I result I did not enjoy the movie very much, despite being extremely impressed by many things within it.",989193600,41,3310,4.543001686340641
1327758,5,B00003CXPV,"Well. I have to say I am shock. Not really because of the content. It was very well done, and it does leave you with a sense of dread of the hysterical- especially if you understand it as a  writer. It is very graphic and grisly in ways, but at turns dark and delicate at the same time- in a similiar vein to De Sade's own writings. Of course it doesn't come close to the marvel that his writings were- or the perversness, but touches on it. The horror is in the remarkable scenes that are played out- in layer upon layer that gets heavier and heavier. It is like the dark tapestries of the walls in France themselves.
Very well done. The photography is sumptuous, dark, and enthralling, and no detail is left undone. The Marquis himself does not enter the film immediately but begins the voice over, which I thought was a nice touch.
Yyou will love Geoffery Rush's performance. It was brilliant. All the actor's were great, and Joaquin Phoenix once again holds his own, and at very times almost steals things from under everyone's nose.
Other reviews have ripped this movie apart, and so they should. But perhaps what they don't get- and they don't like- which I encounter often, and find rather amusing- is the hypocrisy of society and hypocrisy played out as a ""virtue""- which it most often is- IS the very undercurrent that destroys works of ART- real works of art- and destroys the foundations in which socitey places all other virtues- that are in fact the real ones- and doesn't delinate a place for vices that are pure and cannot be stemmed by others. It is a film that gives voice to the individualists, and says; yes, you can hold your vices intact but beware how you use them, and what you do with them. It conveys morality as something which should be held in high regard, but not used to condemn others. The same should be said of immorality- depending on the way it is seen.
I have to say I identified mostly as a writer- with the blood as ink symbolism, and thought it was well done. There are some liberties taken, but since it will never really be known what went on in the asylum ""as fact"" when De Sade was there- due to the overwhelming prejudice against De Sade, and the fact he was seen more as a monster than anything else. In the end it is a movie worth seeing. If you are looking for mere ""curiosity"" you won't get it here. There are monsters, and there are angels and at times, the lines are well blurred. I fail to see why the critics condemn movies liek this- as I think they are as needed- even more so- than the drivel  that hollywood continually passes off as entertainment. There was more horror in 5 minutes of this film that in the entire ""Blair Witch Project"" a film I detest, and think is nothing but a video taken by someone who had too much beer in the woods one night.
As for Quills, I am hoping it will stand the test of time. I think it's very valid, and while not a historical piece on De Sade, it is a comment on all the things we ""think"" are virtuous, that could easily turn on a dime, and consume us with fire, on any given day.
There is a point in the film where De Sade's wife says;  ""Let me tell you the one true act of horror that he has done...in the folly of youth, he made me love him...""
This sums it up pretty well, and for me- hit home more than I would like to admit.  I think the horror of life is not always living it, it's just trying to get past the facades- and hypocrisy that passes for honor.",988416000,12,3454,4.268702290076336
1327759,5,B00003CXPV,"The quality of DVD picture and sound for Quills is excellent ... it needed to be to do justice to this faultlessly directed drama!
Quills immediately informs its viewers that its primary tale is not the historical truth of the Marquis de Sade, its central character. Instead, but with significant respect for the author who has continued to divide readers' opinions to violent extremes, it communicates how there is a coexistence of contradictory extremes within individuals and within any society where guardians of public morality are involved! To quote from the movie, ""Angels and demons walk among us on the earth and, sometimes, they jointly inhabit the soul of a single man!""
To communicate this universal drama, the actors become transcendent! They become credible historical characters AND timeless symbols of human neuroses/joys/tragedies AND justification for an optimistic vision for ""the great eternal truths that bind together all of mankind the whole world over""! Truly, Geoffrey Rush, Michael Caine, Kate Winslett, Joaquin Pheonix, Billie Whitelaw  and, of course,  the nascent screen goddess Amelia Warner (who plays Simone, the symbol of natural -deliciously irreverent- freedom from history and institutionalization), all the actors. ...  they are faultless!

It has so many diverse elements in such a meticulous metaphor of artistic balance that a renaissance of quality cinema once more seems possible.... A great addition to the DVD library!",988156800,7,1570,5.426229508196721

It was a dark and dreary story with a set of unlikeable characters.  Actually the only character that I seemed to like was Joaquin Pheonix's.  Rush gives an awesome performance that rightly deserved the Oscar nomination.  The story however was a little dissapointing and seemed hollywoodish at times.  The movie tells us the story of the somewhat insane Marquis De Sade (Rush), imprisoned in an asylum for the insane.  There a simple maid, who lives there, smuggles out his erotic stories.  They are published and all of France is in an uproar for them.  Send in the devilish Michael Caine, who plays a man bent on correcting the insane with his uses of torture.

After seeing this movie I can say that it uses DeSade to speak out against censorship, just as the Crucible used the Salem witch trials to speak out against the Red Scare.
This movie shows how taking what is happening in the world and transcribing it onto the written page can get you into trouble, especially if you write about people with power. De Sade wrote about society, what he wrote may have been an abhoration back then but what is worse is that society lived what he wrote about. WHat better way to speak out against censorship than in a wonderfully produce film with one of the most notorious of history's characters? Geoffrey Rush is amazing in his role as DeSade and Kate WInslett is a pleasant surprise. It is a powerful and intense film.
If you like this film you may want to try reading DeSade's work, but believe me don't get yourself all hyped. Compaired to society today it is not at all as bad as people say. Maybe if you are not in The Lifestyle it may be more shocking, but basically he is from a time where sodomy was punishable by death, so a lot has changed.

1327765,4,B00003CXPV,"The infamous Marquis de Sade spent the final months of his life in Charenton Asylum for the insane, where within the confines of his cell, he was free to put quill to paper to record the erotic musings of his imagination, thereby (it was hoped) purging his bedeviled mind of them.  The writings were not, however, to leave his cell; but-- as they say-- where there's a will, there's a way, and soon his anonymous manuscripts were causing a stir among the good citizens of France, up to and including the Emperor himself, Napoleon.  ""Quills,"" directed by Philip Kaufman and written by Doug Wright (adapted from his own play), is a fictionalized account of the Marquis during that period, and of the effect he (and his words) had on those with whom he came into contact, either directly, or through his writings.  It's a film that runs the gamut from the bawdy to the perverse, while maintaining an objectivity throughout that allows each individual member of the audience to judge the ramifications of it all for themselves.  It's an interesting film through which some insight into human nature may be gleaned; or not-- depending upon your own perspective and point of view, as well as the level of sensitivity and sensibility with which you receive the information afforded herein.  Visually, the film is striking; Kaufman successfully captures the essence of the era, and the performance by Geoffrey Rush (as the Marquis) alone is worth the price of admission.  Rush accords himself a freedom of expression entirely consistent with the character he portrays, holding nothing in reserve as he brings him so vividly to life.  His Marquis is emotionally complex-- personable and repugnant at the same time-- and it's that depth of character with which Rush manages to imbue him that makes him believable.  Rush was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor for it, and deservedly so.  Kate Winslet gives a notable performance, as well, as Madeleine, the laundress who smuggles the Marquis' writings from the asylum and turns them over to an agent of his publisher.  There's a natural, earthy quality to Winslet that lends just the right touch to the character and makes her memorable.  And a nod must go to Winslet for making some bold career decisions after her mainstream success in ""Titanic.""  With her pick of any number of ""safe"" roles from which to choose, she had the daring to take parts with substance and character-- like Madeleine-- as well as the roles she opted for in ""Hideous Kinky"" and ""Holy Smoke,"" rather than sit on her laurels and let her talent stagnate.  It's a rare quality in an actress of her caliber, and it would be an injustice to let it pass without comment.  Michael Caine, on the other hand, though arguably one of the most talented actors of our times, turns in a fairly anemic performance as Dr. Royer-Collard, who is personally dispatched by Napoleon to the asylum to rein in the exploits of the Marquis.  And the fault, perhaps, lies not with Caine, but with the character itself; for as a battle of wills ensues between Royer-Collard and de Sade, the good Doctor must maintain a rather stoic countenance, which contrasts unfavorably with the flare and single-minded zealousness of the Marquis.  Joaquin Phoenix, too, as Coulmier, the Priest in charge of Charenton, gives a passable performance, but one that seems somewhat tentative, especially compared to his superior turn in ""Gladiator,"" for which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  The supporting cast includes Billie Whitelaw (Madame LeClerc), Patrick Malahide (Delbene), Amelia Warner (Simone), Jane Menelaus (Renee), Stephen Moyer (Prouix) and Stephen Marcus (Bouchon).  A provocative film that makes something of a statement about righteous hypocrisy, ""Quills,"" taken as the work of fiction that it is, will be a satisfying cinematic experience for most; but be forewarned-- this is not a film for everyone.  The content and subject matter may be a bit too strong for some, depending on personal taste and sensibility.  And, those who come to this film seeking historical enlightenment may be disappointed.  But taken with regard to artistic merit, this is filmmaking at it's best; work for which Kaufman and Co. are to be applauded.",984614400,,4245,4.9675141242937855
1327766,4,B00003CXPV,"I really wanted to enjoy ""Quills"" more than I actually did. In the end I admire the film but I never really felt emotionally attached, which means it has really failed on some levels.
 If a film fails to draw the viewer into the drama, it has failed on some level, and that is exactly what happened here, and all the Brilliant Performances in the World can't turn the picture from merely a Great film, into a Spectacular one; but boy do they try.
Geoffrey Rush truly gives his greatest screen performance yet. He is Utterly Brilliant in his portrayal of the Marque De Sade and it's a Shame that the film has been release against Performance Guggernauts like ""Cast Away"" and ""Traffic"".
Joaquin Phoenix also gives his best performance yet. Kate Winslet has given too many to count, as has Michael Caine, who doesn't have enough screen time to really give a memorable performance.
On a whole, it really is a great film, and in time will still be looked on favorable. But you can't blame a guy for having Elevated Expectations. The Acting is Thoroughly Top-Drawer, the Sets and Costumes are Spot on and the Screenplay and Direction are also Well above average.

7918462,2,B00003CXPV,"Review of Quills
Hot Toasty Rag, November 28, 2017

Geoffrey Rush plays the slightly insane Marquis de Sade, a sexually explicit writer during 18th century France. Banished to an asylum, he still writes his naughty stories, smuggling them out through Kate Winslet, the laundress. While the powers that be want him to stay silent, Kate and his other readers are riveted. Meanwhile, the priest Joaquin Phoenix tries to hide his growing feelings for Kate, and Doctor Michael Caine is sent to evaluate the patient.

If you like extremely naughty period pieces, youll probably like Quills. It feels a bit over the top, but that tone is probably on purpose to fit in with the setting. A low-key film in a lunatic asylum just wouldnt work! Geoffrey does a very good job, but since hes not exactly likable, its hard to root for him. If he had a compulsion to write dirty stories, why did he have to smuggle them out for public consumption? If his were the only eyes to read his work, it would have saved everyone a lot of trouble. It also would have made for a much shorter movie.

I didn't end up liking this film, because besides Michael Caine, Im not a big fan of the cast. And, while Im not exactly a prudish film-goer, I like the vulgarity to serve a purpose in the film, rather than just to titillate the audience. This film has excessive sexual content, both consensual and nonconsensual, and I felt like I needed a good cleansing afterwards.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to  sex scenes, nudity, violence, and strong sexual content, I wouldnt let my kids watch it. Also, there may or may not be rape scenes.",1511827200,,1658,4.625850340136054
