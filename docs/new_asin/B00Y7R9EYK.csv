7207932,4,B00Y7R9EYK,"This is the Costco version (with the extra disc) and I bought it there for $28.99. So, $64.90 seems like a rip off, IMO. This is a nice set to own. I have never seen these episodes before.",1442275200,13,188,3.973684210526316
7207933,4,B00Y7R9EYK,"For those who have never seen these, be prepared.  Yes, it's funny.  Yes, it's well done.  But it's not up to the standard of later season, it's obvious they're ""getting their feet wet"".  You will enjoy it, just be ready for some ""OMG"" moments as you watch.",1442275200,34,257,4.404255319148936
7207934,5,B00Y7R9EYK,"I always laugh at people who write a review !  I am about to place my order for the Carol Burnett  show lost episodes. I have the other ones I watch her every time they show the reruns on television and I cannot wait to get this Dvd. For years I have been looking for a particular episode in which Dick van Dyck, Carol Vicky and Harvey walking in to the screen and sit down and chairs dressed in concert black to play little chamber music on their toes.  On their big toes. It was hilarious. I pray it's in these lost years.",1442275200,4,524,4.067961165048544
7207935,5,B00Y7R9EYK,"I have greatly enjoyed the 2012 ""Ultimate Carol Burnett,"" which - thankfully - turned out to not be the final word on Carol's remarkable 11-year run on CBS.  Here in ""The Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes,"" we can now enjoy 16 uncut shows from 1967-1972.  None of these shows were part of the ""Ultimate"" package.  The great attraction here is revisiting the debut of many classic characters and sketches.  The list is extensive, but my favorites include: the twisted soap opera ""As the Stomach Turns;"" The Old Folks, Carol and Sis, Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus, and anything with Tim Conway.  Conway was not an official member of the cast until 1975, but he appeared in many early shows.  He often steals the sketch.
""The Lost Episodes"" also features a Hollywood all-star list of guests: Bob Newhart, Lucille Ball (Carol's comedy hero), Don Rickles, Bing Crosby, Andy Griffith, Burt Reynolds, and many more.  My personal favorites are Don Adams and the great - somewhat forgotten - Paul Lynde.  Both men are a riot in their respective appearances.
The musical numbers are often dated, but saved by the ""groovy"" period costumes and dancers.  Bonus features spread across the 6 discs include recent interviews with cast members and guests (and a backstage tour led by Carol herself).  Also appearing in bonus clips are current comedy stars (Bill Hader, Queen Latifah) who discuss the impact Carol Burnett has had on their careers and comedy on television.  Bonus sketches from other shows are also included at the end of most discs.
The verdict: hours of great viewing from the golden age of television comedy.  Carol Burnett was - and is - a giant of comedy.  I'm hoping there are more Carol Burnett Shows in the vault ready for release.",1441670400,129,1742,4.844594594594595
7207936,5,B00Y7R9EYK,I have the other Carol Burnett DVDs and just saw that the first 5 years of her show have never been released!  So excited about this because new shows will be so much fun!  We love showing our kids Carol Burnett because they thought SNL is the greatest comedy on TV.  Now they know better.  Carol invented sketch comedy as far as we're concerned.  Can't wait to get these early shows.,1441670400,35,384,4.352112676056338
7207937,5,B00Y7R9EYK,"I'm so excited! Really looking forward to this because these early seasons have never been out before. I loved watching the Carol Burnett Show with my family when I was younger, so I know I'll love these shows!",1441324800,14,210,4.552631578947368

I like the little book that comes with the video with information about each show.  I think she will enjoy not only the shows but looking at the different hairstyles and clothing over the years as well as guest stars.  I like the fact that each show starts with a commercial from the original show.  I think her husband may also enjoy them because he may well recognize and remember some of the characters and times.  Service was excellent ... I received the DVD within a couple of days and had time to preview it a little to make sure everything was good before sending it to her.,1482883200,,752,4.335714285714285

7208148,4,B00Y7R9EYK,"UPDATE!!! This was my first DVD set I bought, as I was planning on buying the Lost Episode sets one by one. The bonus disc is actually disc #13 from the ""Classic Carol"" set which, after opening it, I was very upset about. Nowhere does it say that if you are planing on buying the individual sets, there's no reason to buy this one. I lowered the product by one star just because of this. Basically, my 6-DVD set of ""Classic Carol"" sadly turned in to a 5-DVD set :(

Of course it's great to see the first five seasons for the first time! And of course the extras are lots of fun too. My one main criticism is that the episodes are not in chronological order. Even though it would be ideal, I know that it would be very costly to release each season one by one due to music licencing. However, I would have preferred that the first disc start with the very first episode (which is on disc 2) so that we can see the evolution and progression of the show from day one. I think that most of the fans would have preferred it that way too!",1479772800,12,1032,4.134328358208955

The only complaint I have about any of the dvd series is that you can't just get a ""complete box collection"" of her show.  They keep dividing the series up in different ways and it cost's way too much that way, plus you have to be careful that you don't get a collection with episodes that are in another collection (I haven't looked at all the different series and episodes they contain, but I'm sure there has to be some cross over in a couple of them, there's a ton of collections).

I like the comedy featured on the channel but I also really enjoyed the variety of musical acts.

When I was younger, I enjoyed watching and experiencing the humor on The Carol Burnett Show.  So when the DVD version came out I purchased three of the season sets.  I must have viewed the program with more innocent eyes back then. When I started viewing the recorded DVD season series, I did not realize how much ""Adult"" content (PG-13) was seen on TV back then.  I am not a prude, but I feel a level of responsibility to filter what my young children view and absorb. So I gave a rating for Adult content of 4-star rating (PG-13) for adults, but for the family I give it a rating of 3-stars as it definitely is not (PG) for children.",1453420800,,654,4.344262295081967

7208366,2,B00Y7R9EYK,"Maybe my tastes have changed since the 70's when we saw this for the first time, but, it was one step above low slap stick---variety shows are no longer a primetime center piece--maybe there is a reason. We still love Carol Burnett and her entire crew !",1452384000,,253,4.404255319148936
7208367,1,B00Y7R9EYK,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She is a fan of the Carol Burnett show. She was very disappointed with this offer. I think they should of stayed lost. Not worth buying. Sorry Carol, we still love you.",1452297600,5,213,4.35

7208369,2,B00Y7R9EYK,These are really lame episodes. I've watched 2 and they were painful. 90% cheesy musical numbers and 10% unfunny skits. Do not recommend for a great Carol Burnett experience,1452038400,,173,5.0
7208380,2,B00Y7R9EYK,TOO OLD AND DATED.,1451865600,,18,3.75

And Bob Newhart, Chita Rivera, Merv Griffin and a host of others you'll love to see years later - or for the first time.  This is great comedy that those of you who didn't see it growing up will enjoy.  Carol and company put today's wanna-be sitcom comedians to shame.",1451779200,,338,4.442622950819672

7208386,3,B00Y7R9EYK,Disappointed.  It's probably not the DVD sets issue.  I think it may be more of my expectations.  I remember the skits and laughing so hard.  This has full episodes and the musical guest numbers drag somewhat.  We have forced ourselves to watch 2 of them all the way through so far.,1451174400,2,282,4.450980392156863

7208410,3,B00Y7R9EYK,"I can't say I didn't like it but it's not great either.  1) no captioning for the hearing impaired; 2) sound is iffy especially during the questions part at the beginning of the show (yes, there is a disclaimer in the DVD set), I think they could have done a better job or if they had problems with sound transfer then at least included captioning to help. 3) I can't remember now why I liked this show, a lot of it is slapstick, vaudeville, etc.  Some of the episodes/skits are fun but so far most are just too campy and ""oh brother"" type of stuff.
To be truthful I've only watched the first two discs and formed the above opinion, I can only hope the skits get better but I'm not holding my breath.  I would not buy this for myself nor anyone else even if they were fierce Carol Burnett Show fans.",1450742400,4,799,4.209150326797386

Not only is it really funny, it is a window into the not too distant past and much of the humor remains topical. In her own wacky way, Carol Burnett really pushed the cultural envelope.

7208619,5,B00Y7R9EYK,"The Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes is a 6-DVD set containing 16 uncut episodes from Seasons 1 through 5 (1967-1972), selected by Carol Burnett herself. Though many collections of this show have been issued in the past, these programs are new to DVD and haven't been seen in over 40 years. The variety show originated in CBS Television Citys Studio 33 in Hollywood and ran from 1967 to 1978. It won 25 prime-time Emmy Awards and in 2007 was listed as one of Time magazines 100 Best TV Shows of All Time. Burnett has been honored with more Peoples Choice Awards than any other actress.

CBS wanted Burnett to do a sitcom, but she said she preferred a variety format where she could play different characters each week with a regular ensemble cast. She had achieved success in this format on The Garry Moore Show a few years earlier. Original regulars included Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner. Frequent guest star Tim Conway would become a regular cast member in Season 8. Each weeks show was taped twice in front of different audiences and the best parts from each taping were edited together.

The set includes the sketches The Old Folks, Carol and Sis, Alice Portnoy, V.I.P., George and Zelda, Charwoman, and As the Stomach Turns. Guest stars featured include Don Adams, Lucille Ball, Bing Crosby, Phyllis Diller, Nanette Fabray, Andy Griffith, Steve Lawrence, Paul Lynde, Jim Nabors, Bob Newhart, Bernadette Peters, Burt Reynolds, Don Rickles, Mel Torme, Flip Wilson, and many others.

Included are over 5 hours of bonus features. They include a backstage tour of Carol and company returning to CBS Studio 33; never-before-seen bloopers and outtakes; the featurettes Fabulous Firsts and On the Spot: Carols Q & A; interviews with Julie Andrews, Carol Channing, Burt Reynolds, Alan Alda, Lesley Ann Warren, Don Rickles, and Carol Burnett herself; bonus sketches Morton at the Movies and The Dentist; and the opening number from the 1971 TV special Julie and Carol at Lincoln Center with a new introduction by Carol.",1442534400,22,2039,4.956140350877193
