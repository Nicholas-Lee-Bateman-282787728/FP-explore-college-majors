I enjoy a movie that is a bit off the regular cookie cutter stuff, but usually they are not very good - this is the exception.  Well done.",1362355200,,310,4.083333333333333

5369042,2,B009VCE806,"This movie has a stellar cast, great sets, stunts and the script was not that bad.  I honestly think the problem was the directing.

5369046,4,B009VCE806,"""Give me the mask!"" Six Elvis impersonators are sitting around playing poker, in the morning one of them (Slater) wakes up alone at the table and is quickly accused of stealing a Native American mask. Trying to convince everyone that he is innocent he tries to find the real thief. One by one people wind up dead and time is running out for him. I have said for a while that just because a movie has an all star cast doesn't mean that it's automatically good. This is an exception. I'm not saying that this is an amazing movie because it's not but this is just plain and simple a fun movie to watch. This is one of the better straight to video movies that I have seen in a while. The writing is very witty and funny. Running gags and repetitive one-liners make the movie funny and fast moving. This is the type of movie you can just put in and watch without having to think about. I like those sometimes. Overall, a very entertaining movie with witty writing. I give it a B+.",1357171200,4,975,4.275675675675676

With a shameless rip-off of 3000 Miles to Graceland thrown in because, well, he must have liked that one too. It's awful in a way that is instantly annoying, and just gets worse.

5369066,5,B009VCE806,"If you have ever walked down the rows of movies at Walmart,  you see hundreds of DVDs of movies you have never heard of, or movies with every wrestler known to man. Now most of these aren't good and you know it, so you keep going to the ""known"" movies with A list actors and buy these.  Then you go home and find out these aren't very good either, but you have heard of them.  Most of us are movie snobs pure and simple.  If it is made with ""good"" actors, advertised on tv, and was shown at a local theatre, then it has got to be better than these Walmart  specials.

 I am as guilty as the next man, but every now and then I get bored in Walmart while my wife who is shopping, and to kill time I stop and look at these ""delights.""  Sometimes I laugh at the plots or ""drool"" over the covers and go on, but every now and then one of them catches my eye and I stop.  I have found some jewels here, Pawn, Stark Raving Mad, Possums, and this one.

The cover is the first thing that catches your eye. If you can ignore the girl, you will notice that you know these actors.  There's Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, and Dane Cook?  Next the plot, cowboys, Indians, Elvis, and a stolen artifact? Hmmm, ? Interesting, no?

Guess what, this is a very well made movie with good acting and the plot.......oh yeah!!!  This movie has a goal to entertain and NOT bore the viewer.  It, unlike many well ""known"" movies, does it job, and does it well. It entertains and it keeps your attention, and I dare you to say that you figured out how it would end.  This movie is quirky, funny, and above all not a time waster.

I truly wish I could tell you more about the story, but I can't.  It would spoil the movie for you.  If you are into a ""hair off"" movie with dark humor, and a variety of Elvis impersonators and one impersonator Elvis impersonator then this is it.",1397779200,11,1847,4.137640449438202

5369072,2,B009VCE806,"Don't waste the money - film is long and drawn out when it's not launching into a flashback scene and such a pale imitation of Grindhouse cimema type films it's not funny.

If their intent was to poke fun at Quentin Tarrantino's films (most notable the Kill Bill films and Pulp Fiction) they should have tried harder - it was pretty pathetic.",1376092800,,342,4.516129032258065
5369073,5,B009VCE806,"i buy a lot of cheap movies. i watch a lot of cheap movies. i regret buying and watching cheap movies. But i keep doing it because occasionally i find a movie that makes it all worth it. Movies like this one.

Did this ever go to the movie theaters? i don't remember it so i'm assuming it's direct to video. But on the other hand, it's got a number of well known actors so maybe it had a big budget. Either way, it's fantastic. Super awesome fantastic.

What's it about? All the other reviews already tell you that. The chief of an Apache casino loves Elvis impersonators. He holds contests for them. He lets them play 5 card draw in the back room. And that means they're past the main security, making it a lot easier to steal a ceremonial mask stored in the chief's office. The next day, the mask is gone and all they know is that someone dressed like Elvis took it. And from there begins the movie - everyone is looking for every Elvis they can. The casino owners send out their best men. The Rancher, who owns everything that isn't on the reservation and wants the mask just because he hates the Apache, sends out his best men. The cops want it. The neighbor wants it. Some drop dead gorgeous blonde assassin who acts oddly and keeps throwing out red herrings wants it. Asian Elvis. Midget Elvis. Gay Elvis. Everyone. And poor Christian Slater, a down-on-his-luck nobody who loses all his money and enters an Elvis impersonator contest to impress a girl, is in the middle of it, getting beaten up by every single person in town.

The official review i read said it's like Snatch, Pulp Fiction, etc. i read that it's grindhouse or Tarantinoesque. i have no idea where those ideas come from. i suppose i can see Smokin' Aces, in the sense that it's a movie about a bunch of people wanting another person, but from that standpoint it's also like The Watchmen, 300, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Maltese Falcon, Goodwill Hunting and Roger Moore's debut as James Bond in Live and Let Die. This movie didn't feel like any of those other movies. It certainly isn't vaguely grindhouse and Tarantinoey. The closest i can think of is Lucky Number Slevin, a fantastic movie with a terrible name, although that was about a guy that really was trying to rip someone off rather than someone at the wrong place at the wrong time. So maybe it's more like the spy movie The Man With One Red Shoe and the more recent spy movie The Cleaner. But mostly, it's like Guns, Girls and Gambling.

What type of movie is it? It's kind of funny, but not in a comedian or slap stick sort of way. People get shot and punched but it's no action movie - the longest fight scene is around 5 seconds long, normally with people being shot offscreen. There is no gore. There are two nude scenes, each 2-5 seconds long featuring a bit player who isn't the blonde on the cover. Not much cursing. No one attempts to be cool or stylish (yes, the assassin quotes poe, but always at the start as if it were a code phrase; she only attacks when the other person fails to respond appropriately).

If you're a parent wondering whether you should allow your kids to see this... You know what, that's never going to happen, the movie is called Guns, Girls and Gambling, i'm pretty sure you know whether you're going to let your kids watch this.

It's hard to rate a movie in any way that helps other people because everyone has their own taste but for me personally, my day lit up when i realized that all my sifting through cheap movies had turned up something great. With a name like this, i expected it to be really stupid and B-movie but it was actually a legitimately good movie that i think most people would have loved to have seen on the big screen.",1374105600,3,3711,4.41021897810219

5369080,3,B009VCE806,"This is a wannabe grindhouse. It has all the style, but not the substance. John Smith (Christian Slater) is at an Indian casino and participates in an Elvis impersonator contest. One of the contestants steals a rare mask from the casino which culminates into a hunt for Elvis impersonators.

""The Blonde"" (Helena Mattsson) recites Edgar Allen Poe poetry and rather badly as she too hunts for the mask. This grindhouse aspect of Poe reading was done rather well by Daryl Hannah in ""Eldorado in 3D."" The fact is that they stole the idea and could not improve upon it.

Be warned that Christian Slater performed as well in this one as he did in ""Hatfields and McCoys: Bad Blood"" and ""Soldiers of Fortune.""

The film has some twists, but lacks any serious clues, so don't look for any. The dialogue and jokes become stale as we get a constant barrage of Native American vs. Indian or midget Elvis vs. little person Elvis humor. The Asian listing the stereotypes wasn't funny either. It is a film for those who will watch anything grindhouse, even those that don't measure up. Wayne Gretzy's daughter Paulina has a minor role as ""the deputy.""

5369087,3,B009VCE806,"Guns, Girl and Gambling, now that`s` a great attention getting title, add to that Elvis, midgets and an Edgar Allan Poe quoting assassin and you have all the ingredients for this oddball quirky crime thriller that thinks it is more intelligent than it actually is.

Starting off with Gary Oldman dressed in full Elvis garb and waiting in the middle of the desert for ""le bus"".  This opening scene gives you somewhat of an idea as to the sort of cheeky material that is to follows. That soon a gunfight erupts and then the story is told in flashbacks comes as little surprise, but it will  help you to see the angle of where this material is borrowed from.

Starring Christian Slater, who hopes this storyline won't conjure up memories of the awful 30000 Miles to Graceland, but perhaps the philosophical discussion of the king in True Romance. Co-starring once again with Oldman may also help to do that, but it will also help with thoughts of Quentin Tarantino, who is obviously a key inspiration here, in fact it wouldn`t be wrong to call the film Tarantino-esque, but as such it is  fairly okay compared with the many bad movies he`s inspired.

The set up has a group of Elvis impersonators engage in a heist of an ancient ""Apache"" Indian mask stealing from an Indian casino boss (Gordon Tootoosis). There's an Asian Elvis (Anthony Brandon Wong), a Gay Elvis (Chris Kattan) and even a midget Elvis (Tony Cox from Bad Santa). The real thief though is another Elvis (Oldman), who has also set up the Slater character (named John Smith) as his patsy. The complication include a cowboy (Jeff Fahey), an evil land baron (Powers Boothe), corrupt cops (Dane Cook and Sam Trammell), a blonde assassin (Elena Mattisson) and even a girl next door (Megan Pak). There's a lesbian prostitute (Heather Roop), but she doesn't really figure into the plot so much, at least not until the end, thrust in amongst this over crowded group of eccentric characters. Which if she isn't a major player you can see some of the fault right there, too many characters.

Guns, Girls and Gambling covers similar terrine as the recent and much more successful Seven Psychopaths. There nothing all that clever here, but director Michael Winnick's self penned script sure things that there is. He has a good visual style as a director, but is a rather shallow writer.

Featuring a pretty good cast of mostly actors who never quite become the big stars that they almost became. The cast of interesting actors help rise above this material, which at times is more than a little forced and eventually becomes tiresome. Slater, has lately been a very busy actor in both leads and supporting roles on television and movies both theatrical and video. He is a likable presence who adds charisma to just about any movie he's in, and he currently is in high demand, I can't name how many recent films I've seen him in. However, he's not a sign of quality. Oldman is more of a surprise to see n such a B-level affair, but he is always a welcome presence.

Unfortunately everything in Guns Girls and Gabling grows ever more obvious despite it's many ludicrous plot twists, they are actually pretty easy to spot coming. The movie starts off well enough and is very funny at first, but doesn't manage to sustain itself. Still it's not all bad, in fact it is kind of watchable, that cast helps, and sort of fun, despite it's derivative nature.
