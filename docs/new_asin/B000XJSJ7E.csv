8228704,3,B000XJSJ7E,"This film is so bad its almost good!  This is a tongue and cheek take on the War of 1812.  The production value looks like it was a re-enactor film.  Certainly all of the extras must be 1812 re-eneactors and whoever else they could pull in.  The film draws loosely on events during the second year of the war, 1813.  There is silly plot, involving a fake looking Spainish noble, a Canadian harlot, some cheesey looking indians, and US Marines with bad Southern accents! Make no bones about it, the US are certainly portrayed as the incompitant bad guys in what surely must be a Canadian production.  US viewers may be surprised to see themselves portrayed in this fashion!

The movie tries to have a number of twists and turns, all centering on a sargeant and his file of Grenadiers from the 8th (Kings) Regiment.  This corps was instrumental, along with a few other British regiments in holding what was Upper and Lower Canada against the inept US invasions of the frontier.

The production value is minimal, and the acting wooden at best.  Numbers are so small that the final climatic battle scene looks more parody than anything else.  1812 battles were small, but this film makes them look tiny!  Not a serious production, although good for a few laughs.  Still, this must be one of the only films made about the War of 1812 in Canada.",1207699200,2,1339,4.59915611814346
