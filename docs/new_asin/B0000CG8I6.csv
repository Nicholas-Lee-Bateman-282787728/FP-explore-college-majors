1919138,5,B0000CG8I6,"tired of watching these bullsh*t art house fliks? feel like watching something that you don't have to wonder what the hell is going on? i suggest this movie. i think it's great! i like a movie as straight foward and fun as this one. i don't care what these people say, it's a funny movie and i recommend people check it out.",1071619200,,324,4.241935483870968
1919139,5,B0000CG8I6,"This ain't no ""Citizen Kane"", but it is a ton of fun.  Lots of babes in bikinis, muscle cars and cool music.  What more could you want in a b-movie?  Sure, the storyline is thin, but honestly...who cares?",1071360000,,204,4.315789473684211
1919140,4,B0000CG8I6,"What can I say other than a Ramone playing the POPE? I know, MAYNARD playing the devil!!! Maynard not only a great singer(we're talking great) but is a fairly decent actor! The acting overall is sub-par, the plot is a bit iffy, however, isn't it worth 4 stars just to see the great Maynard act, Dee Dee play a POPE, and a lot of naked woman, I highly suggest this movie!",1070150400,3,370,4.225352112676056
1919141,2,B0000CG8I6,"I bought this movie because I am a fan of Maynard James Keenan.  I am also a fan of hot chicks and muscle cars.  All of which are served up in heavy doses throughout the flick.  Regardless, I bairly made it through my initial viewing, and to date I haven't even considered giving it a second look.  Save your money.",1168473600,,315,4.2
1919142,4,B0000CG8I6,"The majority of reviewers are just not getting this: IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE BAD.  That is what makes it so damn funny.  Tongue-in-cheek humor, etc. etc.  We all know how much Maynard loves Hollywood, now is his chance to give a little back.",1128470400,8,238,4.363636363636363
1919143,4,B0000CG8I6,"JUST AS THE COVER SAYS...POINTLESSLY DEPRAVED!! IF YOU LOVED CHEEZ-BALL FLICKS WITH BAD ACTING AND PURE NONSENSE LIKE PLAN 9 OR AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON, THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU. AFTER SEEING THAT THE CAST WAS MADE UP OF MEMBERS FROM BANDS LIKE DEAD KENNEDYS, TOOL, AND RAMONES, I KNEW THE MOVIE HAD TO BE INSANE, AND THAT IT WAS!!",1126742400,3,334,4.403225806451613
1919144,5,B0000CG8I6,"I'm shocked that most people that reviewed this film didn't like it.  The first time I watched this I immediately played it again and possibly again after that.  Now I've seen it so many times I've lost count.  It's warped, twisted, hilarious, and has lots of T & A.  The G-mart commercials had me cackling, Maynard and his huge doner (swoon, well that says it all), and Corey's dance routine had me squealing with glee.  If you have a slightly disturbed sense of humor you will love this.  However, it will probably offend many which is why I loved it.  I scored hella brownie points when I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas last year.  If this sounds like something you would like then buy two copies because you may wear it out.  And there are very few flicks I can say that about.  Mad props to Steve Grasse!!",1122854400,11,819,4.4
1919145,4,B0000CG8I6,"For those unfamiliar, the Bikini Bandits is a regular staple of short films from atomfilms.com. The movie is a collection of 3 or 4 of these type of shorts, with snippits of false advertisments in between. The first time through watching this, I felt it was hard to watch, but after the initial adjustment I came to love it. What makes this film all the more brilliant is that all of these idiot tool fans latched on to it simply due to Maynard's role as Satan, and then hated the movie. They get what they deserve. Maynard isn't god, Maynard is just a nerd who likes Star Trek (check t.d.n. if you don't believe me) So, is this for Maynardites? Hell no. This is for fans of true avant-garde cinema. Featuring cameos by Corey Feldman (who drops a reference to realultimatepower.net), Jello Biafria (Dead Kennedys), Dee Dee Ramone (the Ramones), and a surprise cameo as extras by Phil and Bam Margera, and Ryan Dunn. The only real issue I had with this dvd are the phone conversations between segments. I don't know if they were meant to be funny or what, but they're annoying and I would have liked to have done without them. But beggars can't be choosers. This is high quality internet short film brilliance.",1098316800,5,1209,4.576036866359447
1919146,1,B0000CG8I6,"This is 2 hours that you will want back so bad you will go looking for them with an automatic weapon.  This movie makes you temporary as dumb as an army cook. It's funny and Maynard as the devil was cool to see. Hearing the pope (Dee Dee Ramone) say ""Hey, f*ck you Satan!"" is the best part of the movie, after that turn it off go watch something from A&E to get back the brain cells you lost.",1094428800,3,392,3.962025316455696
1919147,5,B0000CG8I6,"This film is funny! Seeing Maynard James Keenan as the devil is more than worth it alone, not to mention the other cast, Corey Feldman, Dee Dee Ramone, etc.",1085097600,,156,4.413793103448276
1919148,2,B0000CG8I6,"I will start by saying that I awarded this film two (very generous) stars simply for attempted creative filmmaking. It is certainly not the worst movie I have ever seen, but is certainly not good, either. What is it then? It is unique. I didn't really like this movie all that much (though there were a couple of laughs) but it is an absolutely original film, and for the imagination that went into it, I think it's worth two stars.
The film is pretty much impossible to categorize. I would say that it's mostly a fast paced 'girls and guns' movie (that looks like it was edited for MTV) with plenty of muscle cars and silly comic book action plus odd narrative devices and links. A uniting feature of the film is the interjection of faux advertisements from 'G-Mart' which sells things such the ""At Home Meth Lab For Kids"" and ""Corey Feldman's Underwear"" (personally worn by and autographed by Corey Feldman.) While selling Corey Feldman's underwear the female host of the G-Mart Shopping Channel asks this timeless question of her male co host: ""Sam, who hasn't dreamed of owning Corey Feldman's underpants?"" Other uniting motifs include the ornery ""Zembo"", a guy in a fez who mostly serves to annoy, and animated conversations of two of the individuals responsible for this film, a device that I grew tired of after approximately the first 0.000001 second. This is all topped off with some extremely cheesy computer graphics that (evidently) serve to mock early 1980s computer animation.
Now I have described the glue that holds the film together, I might as well get down to brass tacks and say that the first half of the movie is a quite sacrilegious and offensive quest in which the girls perform a detail for Satan, here depicted as a flatulent Rubik's Cube addict, who sentences people to things like watching Corey Feldman dance to the end of time (and, yes, Corey does dance), in one of the more amusing moments in the film. During the performance of their duties the bandits end up in Amish country hiding out with a character known distastefully as 'Mildly Retarded Amish Boy.' Fleeing Amish country they (of course) appropriate a top secret government time travel machine to go back to Philadelphia in 1776, where we get to see a brawl between Ben Franklin and George Washington (whom Franklin calls a 'homo', in one of the less inspired moments of the film.) After stopping to buy a colonial early pregnancy detection kit, the girls are off to a Corey Feldman Fan Club Sleepover Party where they debate the relative merits of Feldman's movies (I think that they decided that 'Goonies' was best, but the film leaves that a bit open to interpretation) and have a pillow fight. Subsequently meeting up with Corey Feldman and his band of Ninjas (!) the movie provides a useful educational service when it reveals that:
1. Ninjas are mammals.
2. Ninjas fight all the time.
3. The purpose of the ninja is to flip out and kill people.
Needless to say, the movie delves into this subject a bit further after showing us some yoga stretches that you will NEVER want to see again, and a musical interlude by ""Ben Beaver"" in which he sings a song titled 'Why Can't I Fart In Front Of You?' Need I say more?
Ultimately the Pope, played by Dee Dee Ramone (""Pope Ramone""), helps win the day and we are treated to a fight between the forces of the bikini bandits and Corey Feldman's ninjas versus the forces of 'The King of the Massively Retarded Exploitation Underground.'
Toward the end there is an interview with Corey Feldman in which, when asked about making the movie, he says ""It was mostly tortuous, truthfully...I'm really kind of ashamed to be a part of it; as we go on I realize this is a big mistake."" To emphasize that this is strictly in jest, the movie runs a caption saying ""Thanks for being a good sport, Corey."" Although Corey probably did mean these words in jest, I think there may be more than a small nugget of truth in them.
There are many extras on the DVD, most notably a US and French Trailer (""Watch Out Frogs"") for 'Le Bikini Bandits.' Also included are some footage of the premiere, a couple of relevant music videos (notably featuring Toilet Boys and the always unpleasant Ben Beaver.) Particularly un-noteworthy is a short film included in the extras (and excerpted in the movie) titled 'The Adventures of Dirty Sanchez', which is a truly depraved and unfunny bit of filmmaking.
All in all, this is not a good movie, but at least it's short. It's 54 minutes contain some occasionally entertaining (and frequently not)moments spent with such luminaries as Corey Feldman, Dee Dee Ramone, Jello Biafra (of 'The Dead Kennedys'), and a couple of guys insultingly credited as 'Gary The Retard', and 'Hank The Angry Dwarf'.
Like I said, at least it's short.",1084752000,9,4779,4.7040572792362765
1919149,1,B0000CG8I6,"Liking muscle cars and girls in bikinis, and bolstered by all the glowing reviews, I decided to take a chance on this DVD. I will regret it my entire natural life. This movie is AWFUL! There is no plot, the girls can't act, the photography will give you a headache with all it's jump cuts, and Corey Feldman can't dance. I would give it NO stars if that was possible.
This stinker is going to wind up on a dealers table at our movie con next September. I cannot for the life of me understand how it rated 4 1/2 stars, unless the cast and crew are doing the ratings.",1083456000,4,565,4.1454545454545455

7999287,3,B0000CG8I6,"For 5 bucks and free shipping, I thought I'd give this one a try. The only reason I got it was Maynard plays the devil. It was pretty funny, and had pretty much no coherent plot, but it gave me a few laughs. I haven't watched the bonus material yet. $5= worth it, but don't expect much.",1393027200,,286,4.035087719298246
7999288,5,B0000CG8I6,"I only watched this because of Maynard being in it. No other reason. I've never seen the Bikini Bandits on the internet. I'm not a fan of muscle cars at all, nor am I into hot chicks with guns. It's kinda boring to me. I DO like chicks, but this tame stuff just doesn't get my juices flowing. After I put it in and turned it on, things changed.

The girls are hot!! No question of that. The plot is really B-rated, right up Sid the Elf's alley, along with the stale acting. It took me about 15 minutes to let go of the ""this is such a stupid movie!!"" to accepting what I was watching and enjoying the ride. I found myself rewinding certain scenes because they were just funny as hell!! The editing of the movie is the best I've seen since any Quentin Tarantino movie. That along with the various segments thrown in that have NOTHING to do with the plot of the bandits (commercials, the yoga dude), and the cheesy PBS music thrown in at various points really put this movie over the edge.

The extras are pretty good too! There are several behind the scenes segments, including the complete (7 minute or so) Dirty Sanchez movie, several ""live"" ads for g-mart (which get annoying real quick), premier parties and crowd reactions, and a few other things I can't remember.
