7893395,4,6305716846,"This 7th tape in the series continues to follow Spark in his quest against the forces of Marmo.  Not much happens in these episodes, but was does happen is very important to the overall story.  The story continues to be  well told and animated, just watch out for the silly cartoons at the end of  each episode.  The story seems to be moving towards a climax as all the  forces involved are coming together.  Even Karla, the Grey Witch, has  reappeared and may be about to take an important role.  I'm looking forward  to the next tape, Dark Island.  If you're a collector of the series, this  is a good tape.  If not, start at the beginning.",951091200,,642,4.384615384615385
