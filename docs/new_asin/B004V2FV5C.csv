8442815,4,B004V2FV5C,"This is one of the early films i saw as a child and one of the first films i had in my house. A family movie about a happy family that gets sad because of the new daughter in law. This is seen regularly now on Hindi Television soaps, but before that there was this film. Mithun Chakraborty is superb as usual in this movie as the good brother. Shashi Kapoor is only in the first half and does a alright job. Moushumi Chatterjee who gets bullied by the new daughter in law is actually kind of annoying. Her character is so weak hearted and forgiving, i find it hard to believe at times. Shoma anand who plays the daughter in law from hell gives a decent performance but sometimes she goes over the top. The remaining cast are quite good among these are Kader khan.",1305763200,,763,4.232876712328767
