8372369,5,B002L2SD5E,"I have a great love of balloons no matter what kind including
the little ones sold in stores.  I love their colors.  This DVD made
me feel like I was actually up in a hot air balloon.  Great",1357948800,,190,3.9473684210526314
8372370,3,B002L2SD5E,My two year old adores hot air balloons. It is difficult to find a DVD that focuses on hot air balloons exclusively. This video comes close but I think it includes too many cut aways of people milling around or waiting. It's all about the balloons people. Not so much about tourists.,1271289600,4,283,4.461538461538462
