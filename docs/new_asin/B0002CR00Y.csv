2076311,5,B0002CR00Y,"I was so happy to find these David Lean titles abailable, especially those not currently distributed in the USA that have been on sale for $70+ each (Blithe Spirit). All movies are as produced and the Korean subtitles can be shut off in the options on each DVD; and the Korean descriptions on the box don't really matter. At $6 per movie, this was a steal.",1274227200,13,356,4.409090909090909
2076312,5,B0002CR00Y,"This set, at $5 - $6 per film,is an incredible buy.  It is more than worth the price for the three Noel Coward items alone.  Two of the lesser known Lean films, Maleleine and The Passionate lovers, are very good as well.  The video transfers are good, even when viewed on a fairly large LCD TV, upscaled to 1080i.  The only slight problem is color variability at a few spots in the Technicolor films - but this may have been in the films themselves.  Do not be put off by the Korean source.  It is easy to remove the Korean subtitles either using the menu or the subtitle button on your remote.  The packaging is very compact.  This is a good thing, except that one of the discs came off the hub in shipment and was moderately scratched.  However, it played well.",1270166400,15,763,4.316901408450704
2076313,5,B0002CR00Y,"David Lean's work collected here is showcased very well.  We see his character studies and adventures, his vision of classic Dickens novels, and his light touch with comedy.  I was unfamiliar with several of the films in this collection and was particularly bowled over by Hobson's Choice with Charles Laughton, a broad farce deftly handled.

The collection's packaging has only Korean liner notes, and subtitles are available in both Korean and English, but the films themselves are as made - all in English.  I purchased this to obtain Blithe Spirit, which I could not find anywhere else at the time.  The other works included are equally valuable and worthwhile, including the supplementary background material about David Lean's approach to film making from several of the skilled behind-the-scenes pros who worked with him.

Highly recommended for collectors of the finest directors in film.",1252713600,43,896,5.274647887323944
2076314,4,B0002CR00Y,"This collection, imported from South Korea can only be obtained from sellers; the Amazon version, Centenary Collection was issued in UK and plays only on Region 2 players. Either collection gives ample opportunity to David Lean fans to know some of his ""lesser"" earlier works. Aside from the best known (like Brief Encounter and Great Expectations) some, like Madaleine are not available in video-tape or DVD in the United States. That and The Passionate Friends are very much worth watching and knowing about. And you do not want to miss The Sound Barrier, an exciting minor epic that also deserves a Criterion nod. Lean was a first rate director, whose early work has been generally neglected, aside from a few masterpieces mentioned. Should you wish to know his opus in its entirety, try this collection (it does omit his first film, In Which we Serve), if you cannot obtain the UK edition. Obviously copies of copies, the DVDs are not in pristine state,in fact, some are rather poor, but they are watchable, and, should you not know Korean, the dialogue and subtitles are also given in English. Despite their second rate quality, these discs still give not only unexpectedly good entertainment, but offer a chance to know more about the director who was to captivate international audiences with his unequalled five epics for several more decades.",1251504000,15,1351,4.982300884955753
2076315,5,B0002CR00Y,"For me, this is an excellent deal: English Language subtitles on NINE very good transfers of David Lean movies at a good price. My wife and I are very satisfied with the entire set. I believe several of the movies aren't available with captions or subtitles anywhere else: Madeleine, The Sound Barrier, This Happy Breed, and The Passionate Friends.

I am pleased with the quality of this Korean import. I was afraid it would be substandard, but it is fine.

The only flaw I've noticed is actually humorous: It claims to contain ""Blithe Spirits."" Of course the movie itself has the title correct, ""Blithe Spirit."" :-)",1250899200,32,616,4.80188679245283
2076316,5,B0002CR00Y,"I haven't yet seen all of the 9 films in this collection, but most of them. The transfers of all I have watched are quite good. It is easy to turn off the Korean subtitles and watch with English ones if preferred (as I do for non-American English dialogue), or with none at all. Lean was a wonderful director, in any genre he chose -- broad comedy (Blithe Spirit, Hobson's Choice), classic adaptations of Dickens (Great Expectations, Oliver Twist), drama (The Sound Barrier, This Happy Breed)...Some of these are not easily available elsewhere, at least in no-region/region 1 format. I have been looking for an excellent transfer of Blithe Spirit, for example, for a long time. It is shameful that the only modern transfer available in the US at this time is this Far-Eastern import, but luckily it is done much more than adequate justice here. I highly recommend getting this box set; you won't be disappointed if you enjoy classic films (especially at a cost of $8 or so per disc). One more thing -- the compact packaging is greatly appreciated as well.",1237420800,65,1055,4.739130434782608
2076317,3,B0002CR00Y,"Note: though the product title has gone, this review was about the collection of David Lean's films from the 1950s, including Oliver Twist and Hobson's Choice. It was released, but just as quickly withdrawn. The original note is below.

The ""review"" I wrote a couple of weeks ago needs ammending; I first discovered the collection was to be released on a US website; but since the release date has come and gone with no discs, I've checked with some DVD online sellers and discovered that no-one except Canadian sites now lists it, and they all say -- not yet released. The hypothesis is that the set has been withdrawn, for reasons unknown. If that is indeed the case, then don't look to see it any time soon. I also agree with the other reviewer: it's a sin that these discs are being given Region 1 release without the extras supposedly available on the Region 2 releases. It's looking more and more like I ought to get an all-region, overscan correcting player .....",1095552000,,970,4.6395348837209305
2076318,5,B0002CR00Y,"Yes, the movies are those listed, and the details for the UK edition, that I pressume are the same for this one, are:
Fullframe aspect ratio.
English Mono audio track.
English, French & Spanish subtitles.
Theatrical Trailer for just 4 of them.
That's it, I wonder why they didn't put something else like biographies at least. All the discs are coming out alone, or in this box set. Buying the current editions in Amazon.co.uk is almost the same price, and those have a little (or much) more extras than this ones. But those are region 2 Pal, and 2 or 3 movies aren't available (Madeleine). This is a good buy, after all;the extras of the other editions aren't very good in fact. Yet as its own DVD release is sinly poor. I don't know why they decided to get this particular collection, but it doesn't make justice at all. David Lean is one of the greatest director (in my opinion), and the movies are worth of course, but if you have the player, buy the already available region 2 editions, and buy the 2 or 3 unavailable from this ones. I do like the color covers -. I put five stars for the movies, obviously, the box deserves two. Again, it's good that they made a take to this old great movies, but they didn't make much effort. And I'm still waiting Ryan's Daughter DVD.",1087776000,3,1275,4.4297872340425535

2076320,5,B0002CR00Y,"I had put a 3 star rating because of packaging damage.  However, the supplier immediately addressed the problem and is shipping out new holders so I am switching to 5-star.  I am very impressed with this supplier and glad they stand behind their products.  The DVD itself was a gift and the receiver said the David Lean movies are literary classics and this was a great deal!  The transfers are wonderful even though it was an import.  Subtitles can be set to English so this was a perfect gift.",1365292800,,495,4.51685393258427
2076321,5,B0002CR00Y,"David Lean DVD Collection Box Set [9 Discs, Import, All Regions] (Oliver Twist /Great Expectations / Blithe Spirit / This Happy Breed /Brief Encounter /Madeleine /The Sound Barrier /Hobson's Choice) (2010)

First, notice when you read ANY review, but especially those posted for this DVD set, the line beneath the reviewer's name that begins with, ""This review is from:"".  It will tell you EXACTLY what product is being reviewed (barring any mistakes made by the reviewer himself).  Using this caveat, notice that the three reviews for this set that were posted in 2004 were for a DIFFERENT set.

Amazon has a tendency with movies and books to combine reviews for different formats of the same film/book.  For example, a book sold in the hardcover format will probably have many reviews for the paperback version of the same title.  Sometimes this will skew the ratings as the paperback version may not be as rugged as the hardcover version.  This is somewhat the case with this DVD set.

The ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) for this set is B001LU2V78.  This DVD set contains:
- Oliver Twist
- Great Expectations
- Blithe Spirit
- This Happy Breed
- Brief Encounter
- Madeleine
- The Sound Barrier
- Hobson's Choice
- The Passionate Friends

You should know before you buy this set that it apparently was produced to be sold in Korea.  The markings on the outside of the slip case are in both Korean and English, contrary to comments made by some earlier reviewers.  Each of the interior cases within the slip case is labeled with the film's title in both English and Korean.  The description of the film on the interior case is in Korean only.  Each individual disk is labeled primarily in English with a small bit of Korean (the title, I presume) on the disk label.

The DVD's play in English.  That is, all the dialog by the actors is English.  The DVDs default to Korean subtitles when you start them up.  You will have to turn the subtitles off in the disk menu if you don't want to see them.  English subtitles are also available on the disks.

All of that was to try to alleviate any concerns you may have regarding the furor of some reviewers (who, apparently, didn't actually play any of the DVDs) over the Korean.  It's not an issue.

Amazon's Product Details notwithstanding, all of these movies except for ""This Happy Breed"" and ""Blithe Spirit"" are Black and White.  I could not verify that these DVDs are region-free, but they do play fine on players set for the USA.

So far, I have watched only ""Hobson's Choice"" and ""Oliver Twist"" from this set.  Both films are outstanding.  I had seen the made-for-TV ""Hobson's Choice"" with Sharon Gless, Richard Thomas, and Jack Warden years ago and really enjoyed it.  When I searched for a copy, I couldn't find that one and bought this set.  That turned out to be very serendipitous, since this set is truly a gem.

If you are looking for that more modern, made-for-TV version get it here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hobson-s-Choice/dp/B0088Q1T26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hobson's Choice</a>

If you want to buy only the David Lean ""Hobson's Choice"", which is included with this set and which stars Brenda de Banzie, John Mills, and Charles Laughton get it here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hobson-s-Choice-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B001LMU1A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hobson's Choice (The Criterion Collection)</a>

While ""Hobson's Choice"" alone is an excellent movie, for only twice as much money you can buy this set and get the other eight films as well.

Other reviewers have commented on how wonderful these films are, but recognize that they were made from 1944 through 1954.  Don't expect high-definition or surround sound.  If you have realistic expectations of a DVD transfer of a film from that era you will enjoy many very nice movies, all of which were made prior to Hollywood's fascination with sex, violence, and foul language.

Highly recommended.",1360713600,11,4022,5.125960061443933
2076322,5,B0002CR00Y,"These are priceless old movies, at least two of which (Blithe Spirit and Madeleine)are hard to find anywhere else.  The transfers are first-rate, the picture quality excellent, and the sound as good as one can expect from old British films.  Ignore the silly people who said they are in Korean or Japanese.  The edition is from Korea, so the liner notes are in Korean (not Japanese), but the movies are in English and are clearly labeled in English.  They have Korean subtitles, but every DVD player has a button on the remote for turning off the subtitles.  These are wonderfully satisfying movies.",1327017600,7,599,4.833333333333333
2076323,4,B0002CR00Y,"This is a major contribution to our knowledge of film. The movies themselves probably didn't look as good when released as they do now.  This Happy Breed and Madeleine are a bit weak, but this is made up for by the seven others.  Everyone needs a copy of the superb Hobson's Choice.

My only complaint is with the packaging.  The raised centers holding a disc break off, leaving discs to roll around the box. I put CD sleeves between the double discs, and that seems to work and minimize the possible damage.  The five disc packages are also fitted into the box too tightly.  Quibbles.  This is a collection you want to own.",1322870400,3,624,4.469026548672566
2076324,5,B0002CR00Y,"I love Great expectations and Oliver twist! These old classics are the best! I have not watched the other movie selections yet and am eager to do so at my leisure.  I am totally satisfied with the price, quality, and time of arrival for this product!  I feel lucky to have it knowing that this package was originally made for the Japanese market.",1315612800,,346,4.476190476190476
2076325,5,B0002CR00Y,"A great film transcends the time in which it was made.  So it can be said quite simply but with the greatest emphasis about this collection of director David Lean.  These 9 films cover in my opinion Lean's best efforts.  With the exception of Lawrence of Arabia, there are none finer in his creative history.  Whether it is the sex appeal and double entendes of ""Blithe Spirit"" that illustrate marriage and discord are timeless issues and humour can be offered without crude language or conduct and still leave one chuckling at our own fraility and silliness or the sorrow of love lost by any means in ""Brief Encounter, The Sound Barrier"", and ""In Which We Serve"" which is a sorrow timeless in it's truthfulness, Lean outlasts even the talented new directors of right now...this very moment.

I for one am beyond disgusted by the films of the last 20 years or so.  While some are indeed good, most gain their audiences and great fortunes through shameless gore and equally shameless and pointless vulgarity.  Frankly, I would think any director of such items would not wish this to be his or her legacy when they are dead and gone.

As so we come back to David Lean, dead now for 20 years, but having left all of us a collection of films which will live for as long as we as a society watch films.  They are timeless.  All made no later than the mid 1950's, they still capture those very things we humans care about or dream about or even obsess about.  They capture our longings and fears without gimics or special effects or gore or bad language.  Yet such as in ""Madelaine"" or ""Oliver Twist"" these are not stories for children.  These are for the most part films for adults as they deal with grown up subjects.  Ask yourself if you can bear to watch, for I still cannot, the brutal beating to death in ""Oliver Twist"" of a harlot and a poor dog.  Lean does not turn away nor deal lightly with the unpleasant side of life.  In ""Madelaine"" which I am watching again today, see if you know whether or not she murdered her lover.  I still, nor can society, cannot answer one way or another that question.  Lean caught that in film forever; this doubt.  Palpable doubt.  Brilliant.  Merciless killing.  Brilliant.

He was a genius.  Perhaps the best filmmaker we will ever see.  These 9 films represent what he was and how he saw things.  A master story teller in every sense of that word.  And most of all, timeless.  These stories are timeless.  People will see these 9 films for the first even 100 years from now and still marvel at the stories he has left us.  Very few other directors will be able to say that.

The David Lean Foundation cleaned these 9 films up for this release.  I hope you can find good copies.  PAL versions in my opinion are the best and are available here and elsewhere with a little computer exploring.  But buy these films.  Share them with other film lovers you know.

And to David Lean, whereever you are, thank you.",1315008000,4,2945,4.480225988700565
2076326,3,B0002CR00Y,"When the package arrived all the printing was in Korean.  I was hesitant to open it since I would probably return it. It was useless to me in Korean.  I took a chance and opened it knowing it might be a hassel to return it.  I found that English was the primary language with dubbing in Korean and subtitles in Korean and English.  I would recommend that the sender inform the buyer that this is an English version and not only Korean. Or send an English version unless otherwise requested.

Each film is beautifully packaged in an attractive slipbox. Now you have to figure how to get around the fact that the set is labeled in Korean. Thus you will need to open the disc cases to see what the movie is. Thankfully the discs are labeled also in English. When watching the movie simply turn off the subtitles. The quality of the movies are superb and appear to be digitally restored. And best of all they are region free.

Both the Dickens' adaptations are masterpieces. But there are a number of films in this Collection I haven't seen. This is a real treasure if you love David Lean as I do. After Hitchcock, he is my favorite director. The only films of his missing from my collection are Summertime and Ryan's Daughter. If anyone is interested in great film making, you can't go wrong by purchasing this collection.

When I received the collection, I went through all the films to make sure they were in English. As has been said by the other reviewers, the label is Korean but the films are in English. You can turn off the Korean subtitles. If you are interested in learning Korean, watching these films would be a good way to do it. Or vice versa.

Charles Laughton is at his best as the victorian enebriate Hobson beset by his managing daughter in Hobson's Choice, my personal favorite of the nine films included in this collection.
