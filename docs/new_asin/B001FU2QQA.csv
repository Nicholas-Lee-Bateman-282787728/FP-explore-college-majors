8302710,4,B001FU2QQA,"This film is a satire about the American health service of the time and the effects of capitalism in it.  As black comedies go it achieves black farce at times and I think that the points it makes are worth making.  This is not a cinema masterpiece technically like Hoffman or The Optimists but like these it is a mature Sellers classic that has been completely under rated.  Apparently the Region 2 version is edited, so hopefully the Americans will produce a proper edition.",1352505600,3,476,4.642857142857143
8302711,2,B001FU2QQA,"Well, I can't really review the product, since after sending it back twice to the seller, I found I couldn't play ""that region"" dvd on my
stateside player. The seller ""suggested"" I buy (make another purchase?) an all-region player to play this dvd.

 After ""serious"" consideration, I determined I won't buy another player just to play this dvd, and need no other purchases to be made.
I assume my refund was credited to my account, although I never got a
reply from the seller.",1299801600,,477,4.666666666666667
8302712,4,B001FU2QQA,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and just about dying, I was laughing so hard.  I've looked for this movie over the years and have never been able to find it, until I found it here.  It was only available in European format so I had to rip the dvd onto a hard drive in order to watch it, but I do that with all my movies anyway.

It wasn't quite as funny as I remember it being, it's a little bit old, dated and corny (kind of like me, actually), but Peter Sellers is a riot as the lecherous, corrupt hospital administrator.  He could have used a stronger supporting cast, but this is worth watching for his performance alone.
