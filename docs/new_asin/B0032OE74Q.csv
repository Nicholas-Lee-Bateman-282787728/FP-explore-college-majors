8387618,4,B0032OE74Q,This is an excellent boxed collection if you are interested in the 1950's classic Douglas Sirk genre of movies.,1430697600,,111,4.894736842105263
8387619,5,B0032OE74Q,"Douglas Sirk's movies are masterworks in melodrama, and I don't understand why a more comprehensive box collection of his movies hasn't been made for the United States.  During his time his movies were popular among audiences but derided by critics for being fluff, but today critics and filmmakers have caught on to Sirk's ironic and brutal critique of American society and have seen the mastery in his work.  Even if you're not a film aficionado, you can still appreciate these movies for their entertainment value; they are filled with drama and are beautiful to watch.",1340668800,12,572,5.010526315789473
