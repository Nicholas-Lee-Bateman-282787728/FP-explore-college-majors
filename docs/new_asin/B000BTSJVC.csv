8092570,5,B000BTSJVC,"Act of Will is an often overlooked gem by author, Barbara Taylor Bradford. The author herself has called this novel/movie her ""most personal work of fiction."" Act of Will is the story of three generations of women in an English family and their struggles to live up to family expectations. A very young Elizabeth (Liz) Hurley makes her screen debut as the grandaughter. Victoria Tennent (LA Story) is the film's star. This emotional rollercoaster will elicit both laughter and tears.
Highly reccomeded for anyone who enjoys an epic family saga.",1207872000,2,544,5.055555555555555
