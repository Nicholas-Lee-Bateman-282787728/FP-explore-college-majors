I would urge anyone to not buy directly from their site; here is my story with them: It all started when I decided to buy this item directly from INETVIDEO, which was the beginning of a long line of disappointment. After my initial transaction on their site, there was no receipt and no way of checking the status of the transaction, yet they charged my credit card. Their website lacks a lot and is impossible to navigate. I tried calling them but there was no way of speaking to a person, which I found very odd. Every time I called, there would be no answer, or a phony greeting would entertain me before hanging up on me. I actually tried all day, en vain. So I started to panic and contacted my bank to make them aware of the situation and a week later, the transaction was cleared. I was becoming desperate to buy this item for my brothers birthday and continued looking elsewhere until I saw it on Amazon.... unfortunately it was still sold by INETVIDEO -as one of the marketplace- through Amazon. I was hesitant, but remembered that I have always had a great relationship with AMAZON who ensured me that if anything went wrong they would reimburse me or make up for any inconvenience. So with peace of mind, I bought it from INETVIDEO, again, but this time through AMAZON. Everything went smoothly. This time Amazon provided me with a receipt. It took about 2 weeks for the item to arrive. When we finally watched the movie, the introductory song we were hoping to hear again was missing. It was as if this part was cut from the original film, which was kind of a let down. The movie just started right away with a brief introduction of who the captain flam is... In addition to that, somewhere in the movie, the picture started going crazy for about a minute. While the item is suppose to be new. It took a little over a month for us to get the movie - Including my prior experience with INetvideo. If you like the peace of mind of speaking to someone when buying online, this seller is not for you.",1287273600,,2165,4.388059701492537
