8118715,5,B000F7NUV4,I enjoyed watching it with my son who is a fan. I understand it is for the Japanese market but I wish it had  English subtitles.,1368230400,,128,3.923076923076923
8118716,5,B000F7NUV4,Ginga Densetsu Weed is the best show I've ever seen! It's about a young Akita-Kishu mix who must try to rescue his father and save the world from an evil Great Dane. This show made me cry many times becasue it's just so sad! But it's full of great action and I love it. The show is only in Japanese but I think it adds to the show's greatness(If you don't mind reading the subs at the bottom of the screen.)But It's the best japanimation I've ever seen! If you liked Wolf's Rain then you'll love this!,1201910400,8,501,4.175257731958763
