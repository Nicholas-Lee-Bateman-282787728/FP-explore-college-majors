5528544,2,B00AYJBTS4,With 4 stars I was thinking this was going to be a good horror movie.  Not worth the money renting.  Extremely cheesy ending.,1371254400,2,125,4.391304347826087
5528545,2,B00AYJBTS4,"I thought I was getting it free through Amazon prime - but was charged.  The movie is not terrible, but it's just not very good and is predictible.",1370390400,2,147,4.25
5528546,4,B00AYJBTS4,"My expectations were lower than low for A Haunting at Silver Falls. I've seen too many horrible ghost movies in the past 10 years to even count, so I figured this would be nothing new. And though it's not technically anything ""new"", it does feel rather unique, which is asking a lot of movies nowadays. For the first half hour I was not as optimistic, however. The beginning of the movie really put me in the mind of Twilight (which is sooo NOT a good thing!) Too many hints of high school romance, too much focus on a teenage girl adjusting to her new home life, too much blandness. The decent acting was the only thing keeping my eyes on the screen, but I'm glad I continued watching because once the movie picked up I ended up really enjoying it. The twist at the end is what really peaked my interest - totally made the whole girl-growing-up-dealing-with-love-and-ghosts thing seem almost fresh once again. Sure, you've seen a lot of this story in a million other movies already, but compared to a lot of other ones released today - this isn't a bad way to waste an hour & a half.",1370044800,21,1084,4.425
5528547,4,B00AYJBTS4,"This was a pretty good movie that is geared towards kids from ages (approx.) 8-13.  The acting was good and it was simplistic enough.  Basically, it's a murder mystery and ghost story.  The movie revolves around teens (no sex, no real drug taking, no soft porn), and the villains were the adults.  It reminded me of stories my daughter used to read around the age of 10, such as R.L. Stine's Fear Street, ect. All in all a pretty good movie for the age group I mentioned.

As an adult I like films that are geared for adults, such as ""MaMa"" or ""Bag of Bones"".  I rated this movie four stars for the benefit of older kids looking for something ""clean cut"" in the category of ""haunted."" That's a hard thing to find nowadays.",1369699200,33,722,4.350746268656716

5528569,4,B00AYJBTS4,"This having been filmed mostly in my home town of Silverton, I give it a higher rating than most just for the 'coolness' factor of seeing places you know in a movie! As for the story-line it's interesting though too many implausible scenarios such as the convicted dad wearing his ring in prison. I hear a bit about the 'true story' aspect & will explain that although there is no documentation there are similar occurrences that are known to many locals. There have been a lot of 'disappearances' in the Silver Falls area dating back to the 1920's - several 'serial killers' have emerged from Silverton & surrounding areas.

5528607,5,B00AYJBTS4,"A Haunting at Silver Falls is a good ghost mystery full of twists and turns. It's down right spooky at the start, and while the haunting becomes much more sedate, the mystery gets way creepier and darker than I expected. The characters are engaging and just quirky enough to keep me interested, while the cinematography and imagery tell the story in a beautiful way.

If you're look for gore and terror, might be a pass, but for a good ghost story, visit Silver Falls.",1401840000,,468,4.571428571428571

Her new teenage boyfriend is as understanding as possible but only Jordan can figure out this mystery. Twists and turns abound as Jordan struggles through what is real and what is not. On a technical note, Jordan is played by Alix Elizabeth Gitter. She is a young actress who is destined for greatness. A talented girl who you will be hearing about in the future. This is a very good movie which I hope you will enjoy as much as I did.

I'm going to watch it again to see if I can figure out what really happened.,1400976000,,367,4.417910447761194

5528614,3,B00AYJBTS4,"A Haunting at Silver Falls (Brett Donowho, 2013)

I hadn't trolled the bottom of my Netflix queue in a while, so I resorted it then took a look at the titles in the bottom five. The only one that struck my fancy that particular day was A Haunting at Silver Falls, so I settled in to watch, hoping against hope that this would be one of those rare birds where the public was entirely wrong and this was an overlooked gem. It's notthere's a little too much you really expected me to suspend that much disbelief? in the final third of this debut scriptbut it's better than I expected given its position at the low end of that particular totem pole.

Plot: Jordan (The Bling Ring's Alix Elizabeth Gitter) is a newly-orphaned teen who's been packed off to live with her aunt and uncle, Kevin (X2's Steve Bacic) and Anne (My Best Friend's Wife's Tara Westwood) Sanders. Not long after she arrives at the new homestead, she starts seeing thingsthings that turn out (this isn't a spoiler given the cover art) to be the ghosts of a pair of local twins (Gamer's Jade and Nikita Ramsey) whose father is about to be executed for their murder. But why are they haunting Jordan, specifically? And, perhaps more importantly, are they going to get in the way of a possible romance with local nerd Larry (Mansion of Blood's James Cavlo in his feature debut)?

Donowho (5 Souls) and a trio of writers all turning in their first script do a competent job. It's not great, and it's certainly not subtle, but it's watchable enough to spend a quick hour and a half with. The Big Reveal is bats enough that you're either going to love it or hate it. I laughed. That doesn't tell you which side I came down on, though, does it?  I thought it was a barrel of cheesy fun. ***",1399420800,,1749,4.422360248447205

The movie was a nice turn back in time when movies were scary and gave you enough pieces of the puzzle to put it together if you have two bits of common sense. It was not gross by any means and is probably fine for anyone over the age of 12. Nice to have a scary movie we can watch as a family for a change. I think I'll buy this one to add to my collection.

(Small advisory - there are just a couple ""implied"" scenes)

My teen enjoyed it - watched at night with the lights out.  I'm thankful for the other reviewers for their common sense approach...and I agree that it is very similar to an RL Stine-type thing.

This one tried to tell a different kind of story and pretty well managed it. The bit with the therapist and the intervention was contrived, and I'm still puzzled about one minor thing that got left unanswered toward the end, a remark I can't really explain without spoiling something and eliminating one of the suspects before you even watch the movie. Through the makeup, the Brit Twins (as Jade & Nikita Ramsey were called back when they were on Movie Mob) weren't recognizable. I didn't know it was them until the end credits.

However, some scenes tried to be scary but didn't quite deliver. An example was when a ghost was walking around town.

The film is a ghost story that is a mystery. The ghost effects are decent, but there isn't much of a scare factor, as Jordan becomes used to their presence and can't seem to eat her Sugar Pops without them. The film drops clues and at an hour into the feature I thought I had it figured out, but as it turned out I latched unto the head fake instead of the clue and the film ended different than I expected.

A good ghost story who like a mystery more than horror.

Story: Putting pieces of a ring together, that had a sort of Talisman power to invoking these two twin girls. It had twists and turns, it just took awhile to get to the main point.
Plot: was better than a lot of these traditional ghost movies, the fact that we are put in the position to find out who killed these girls was not new, just the reveal at the end was unique. Yet the killer was supposed to be older I would think.
Acting: came a little hit or miss. The lead girl played the role well, and had believable skills, but then again she is a teen.
Supporting roles: Had quite a fun time deciding who was the best out of these b-list actors...Larry was believable and funny, the drug dealer son of a cop was alright; but the couple that she stayed with could have been switched out with another couple.

A Haunting at Silver Falls (2013) **
D: Brett Donowho
C: Alix Elizabeth Gitter, James Cavlo, Tara Westwood, Steve Bacic, Erick Avari, James C. Burns, Tadhg Kelly, James Ralph, Jade Ramsey, Nikita Ramsey
P: A teenager who has been uprooted to a small town after the death of her father is haunted by twin ghosts and must solve the mystery surrounding their death.

Yet another supernatural thriller deceivingly marketed as being in the same vein as The Ring. This one seems to take forever to get going. Once it does, it's just another predictable mystery that would have been better suited as a TV movie of the week.

It's better acted then most. Gitter, in her film debut, brings a solid foundation to the film. Cavlo steals scenes and really pops on screen. He's obviously got a bright future ahead of him. As for the rest of the cast, they all turn in competent performances. Performances that are quite frankly better then what the film deserves. There's also some picturesque scenery and some attempts at character development.

All in all, A Haunting at Silver Falls is an OK film, the type of film you watch once and then instantly forget about. Nothing about it makes it unique or stand out. You'll see it in Redbox machines for a little while and then it'll just disappear with all the other supernatural clones that have been hitting the market ever since Paranormal Activity re-energized the sub genre.

Most things made no sense and was cliche as scary haunting movie. Who ever made this makes you want to head butt them for attempting a scary movie. The ghost girl is barely ghost the whole time she appears in almost every scene and when sshe does ... Well lets just say shes better off being a prop.

The story is basically a whodunit, but the setup doesn't lead to anything, just a twist for its own sake.

It had a couple of ghost girls who would just stand there for the main character to notice from time to time. The story itself was dumb.

To scare an audience, a malevolent presence needs to make itself noticed in subtle ways at first and/or suddenly appear in a shocking manner.  Anyone who watches spooky movies knows this.  How can a producer or director . . . ANY producer or director NOT know this?  Ghost movies, when they are done right, with novelty and imagination, are delightful fun.  Like a roller coaster.

5528677,3,B00AYJBTS4,"Jordan is sent to live with her aunt and uncle after the death of her father, but she has hardly settled in before twin spirits from the surrounding woods latch on to her as a living conduit for their revenge. Alix Elizabeth Gitter stars in Brett Donowho's chilling new ghost tale, A HAUNTING AT SILVER FALLS. Gitter is sweet and sincere in the role of Jordan, presenting us with a true to life character that isn't without her own imperfections. After discovering the ring of one of the missing girls, she is haunted by terrifying visions that lead her to their true killer. Donowho relies on subtly over outright shock, using the nerve-shattering images of the two disfigured ghosts to his full advantage. SILVER FALLS draws heavily from outside influences like STIR OF ECHOES in the outline of the plot, but the blatant clues that are left throughout the film make for a far less impressive finale. This does not detract much from the overall production, however, which serves up frequent scares on a modest budget.
