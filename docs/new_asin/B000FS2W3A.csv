2582757,1,B000FS2W3A,"So, i'm not one to really ever write reviews for movies, tho I do watch a lot....but this movie was terrible.  The acting was fair (which is sad b/c I really do enjoy Steven Webber)...but the whole Jenifer Kills, they have sex, kills, sex, kills, sex...is kinda lame.

Take my advance and don't even rent this from netflix...for real....",1156896000,4,337,4.694915254237288
2582758,3,B000FS2W3A,"Dario Argento directs a strange little tale here involving a young girl with abnormal problems. Steven Weber stumbles upon what appears to be a domestic scuffle. When everything is said and done the girl has no where to go and Weber allows the girl to stay with him and his family temporarily. He soon finds that he has made a huge mistake. This girl is not only just a little abnormal, she is down right deranged. Her depravity leads to more than a few gory cannibalized deaths and after several sexual encounters with the macabre woman Weber seems intranced by her. In the end Weber discovers why the girl may have gotten in the mess he originally found her in. One thing is certain once the movie was over I discovered that blondes with hot bodies really do have more fun reguardless of hideous facial deformations.",1156896000,2,818,4.609589041095891
2582759,5,B000FS2W3A,"Jenifer is bad news.  She's got a ton of baggage, she'll strip you of everything you own and love, she's a lousy conversationalist, and she's got weird growths on her tongue.  I don't think the great sex can make up for all the negatives when dealing with Jenifer.  Who is she?  Where does she come from, and is she human at all?  Who the hell cares?  Do you?  I sure as hell don't.  In the disc's documentary, Dario compares Jenifer to a drug, and that's a wonderful analogy for this film.  Jenifer is indeed like a drug, and Steven Weber's character acts increasingly  more and more like an addict.  Even though the evil is so blunt and apparent he just can't let her go.  She's trouble the moment he brings her into the house.  Right off the bat she's biting his wife and eating his cat(hey, that rhymed pretty good, I should think about taking up rapping).  Realistically, you'd kick this chick's [...] all the way back to the looney bin or call the cops, but Jenifer's strength is the powerful drug-like hold she has over her ""owners"".  Weber loses everything because of this woman and it's an interesting and disturbing journey.  Being the Argento fan I am, I was very excited about this particular installment in the Masters Of Horror series.  And I certainly wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get the full impact until a short time after the film had ended and I took time to reflect on certain aspects of the film.  I can say in all honesty, this was very well done.  In terms of style, it's more like Argento's American works like Two Evil Eyes or Trauma, though totally different at the same time.  Fans will certainly check this out without a review to prompt them.  Some will(and do) just dismiss this as gruesome, unscary and dumb, but Argento's name is bulletproof to fans, so nanny-nanny-poo-poo.  Enjoy!",1155945600,9,1817,4.59190031152648
2582760,5,B000FS2W3A,"I am glad to see that Dario still has the ability to make us squemish watching his films .Although made for TV this is a film to be dealt with .It has all the elements of what I like about his movies , no over explanations of the beginings and why the characters are the way they are ,execellent use of soundtrack (Psycho music)and violence/gore the I've come to expect .As to the reviewer who said he saw the ending coming 5 minutes into it ,that's the point .You know that he is going to ruin his life trying to help her and that's the horror of it .There is no escaping his fate and you know that it's going to be passsed onto the next good samaritan .Enjoy the film for what it is ,a good scare from a great director .",1155859200,4,722,4.055944055944056
2582761,5,B000FS2W3A,"Believe it or not, Steven Weber wrote the screenplay for this installment. I feared that Argento would go soft because of this (considering all the lame Stephen King tv adaptations Weber has done)...but this is all out nasty stuff. It's important to note that none of Argento's magic camera work or unique perspectives are present--it's all straightforward, but this tale of a man trying to care for a grossly mutated young women with a killer body, who SEEMS pathetic and victimized, makes for a perfect short film. It is utterly disturbing and horrific, and one of the best episodes of Masters of Horror that I own so far.",1155686400,5,624,4.787037037037037
2582762,5,B000FS2W3A,"It sounds like Jenifer (yes one n), got under the last reviewer's skin.  It's that type of story, written over 30 years ago by Bruce Jones. Jones is probably one of the best comic book writers of all time.  This story is about obsession.  How a man cannot pull away from a hideously deformed woman with a beautiful body.  If you enjoy the over the top work of Argento, and the art of Berni Wrightson (which inspired the look of the film), this hour of horror will be appreciated. The dvd has a lot of extras as well.",1155686400,9,516,4.23469387755102
2582763,5,B000FS2W3A,"Ok, let me start by saying this. I love Argento. Suspiria was a classic. Granted, ""Jenifer"" is no Suspiria, but for $12 bucks, it well worth picking up. If you love gore... you will LOVE this flick. Plus, the DVD is LOADED with extras. Well worth the purchase. You should also check out ""Do You Love Hitchcock?"", a brand new, full length movie by Dario Argento, also out today.",1155686400,4,377,4.478260869565218
2582764,1,B000FS2W3A,"While I have not seen or purchased the DVD of Jennifer (Showtime's Masters of Horror), I did have the UNfortunate chance to watch the episode when it originally aired.

It's lousy.

Jennifer tells the tale of a police officer who saves a facially disfigured girl and then develops a strange bond with her.  This bond becomes physical, sexual, and leads to the destruction of many avenues in the police officer's life.

I have so many problems with this story that I don't know where to begin.  First, it's not scary.  Second, the ""twist"" ending can be spotted within the first 5 minutes by anyone with an IQ higher than Forrest Gump.  Third, none of the characters relate to each other so there is no sense of shock or loss at the odd choices the main police officer makes.  Fourth, Steven Webber, who is a decent TV actor, is a crappy writer and clearly bit off more than he could chew with this story.  Fifth, Jennifer herself is absolutely revolting...gross out horror is the lowest denominator of the genre.

Now I realize that the Horror genre is probably the hardest for viewers to personalize.  One man's Jaws is another man's Jaws: The Revenge, but I'd find it hard to believe that anyone would find it worth their time to want to own or repeatedly view the mess that is Jennifer.  Perhaps you'd want to spy the extras included on the DVD...in that case just rent it.

If you disagree please contact me, because I have a bet with a friend that nobody will.",1155686400,17,1464,4.541984732824427
2582765,2,B000FS2W3A,"lol, man just pathetic. Argento... what the hell? nothing in this movie makes sense, it's completely and utterly unrealistic. The main character's actions considering he's a COP, make 0 sense. He leaves his wife and son, all for a ugly mutant woman who turns out to be a cannibalistic sex beast, her face it ugly, but hey she's got a hot tongue and juicy little body. Fill in the gaps and you get the whole movie. Jennifer the mutant sex beast murders the little asian girl next door, the main character/cop finds her eating the little girl... the story moves on as if nobody is missing the little girl!!!!!!!!!!, the story just moves on as if her murder is of no consequence at all, on and on... just STUPID. The lady playing Jennifer had an ok body with some tawdry T&A action, that adds one star to this dud. There is not reason to watch this again other than to stare at the screen in disbelief and maybe get a partial hard-on during the mutant sex beast scenes.",1437696000,,966,4.432584269662922
2582766,5,B000FS2W3A,"Jenifer is the best I've seen out of the Masters of Horror series, a little better than Pelts. Is it just another well-made horrorshow fairytale about supernatural beings with powerful appetites, or is it a cautionary tale about powerful contrasts and relentless chemistry in all human relationships dragging us into strange and uncontrollable situations into which we would rather not have entered, but cannot escape? That question is open, but the horror of Jenifer is delicious.",1432771200,,481,5.342105263157895

2582778,4,B000FS2W3A,"The first tale in the second volume of this horror anthology features a tale called, Jenifer, which represents a fine adaptation by Dario Argento of a tale from the graphic novel Creepy that makes you think twice before empathizing with disfigured individuals and revolves around the story of a cop who rescues a hideously mal deformed girl, Jenifer, from being butchered to death by her foster father, and, feeling sympathy for her, takes her in - much to the disgust of his family, and discovers himself becoming infatuated, with her, despite her hideously mal deformed features,  after being seduced by her and protecting her from the law when she butchers his family, and seeking to start a life with her in the shelter of a shack, until she viciously murders a towns boy, bringing him to the realization that she was evil and had to be killed - only to find himself being shot to death in his attempt to kill her by a sympathetic cop who decides to take her in, thereby, starting the cycle again in what philosophers would call ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.",1356393600,,1066,4.762162162162162
2582779,2,B000FS2W3A,"JENIFER is a Master's of Horror Collection movie that fails to deliver on the writing on the jacket. It seems that the makers of the show thought that once makeup had succeeded in making Jenifer's face extremely unappealing that they were through. It's directed by Dario Argento who is well known to all horror fans.

I'm not saying the premise of the storyline was completely rotten but the ending renders the storyline impotent due to diminishing probability. Jenifer is purportedly a seductress, psychopath & succubus all rolled into one. I can buy one of those, not all three. She supposedly has ""untold carnal appetites & I'll leave it to the women, of whom I'm not one, to determine which of her carnal appetites fits untold, woman on top or wanting sex more than once a week.

She does have a lovely body & you get to see it. Her nipples are noteworthy because of a generous portion of erectile tissue. She does have the ""unspeakable violent depravities"" they mention as well as the mental limitations. The first scene of her violent depravities is somewhat shocking but it was done this way before many years ago & they use similar scenes too often. It loses its impact.

A change at the end would of gotten this movie a 2.5 Amazon star rating but with the one they made I can only give it 2 stars despite a wonderful job by makeup. A single viewing will suffice.",1336608000,,1371,4.587755102040816

2582782,5,B000FS2W3A,"This is Dario's adaptation of an old comic written by Bruce jones and illustrated by Bernie Wrightson. Still considered as one of the best horror comic story of all time. It was great to see Dario doing something a little different for a change. As some reviewers had mentioned, this is not the typical Dario Argento movie, it's a lot shorter and Jenifer is not exactly our typical argento's ""Mysterious killer"" but he managed to show us that he's still the best in the genre even when he tries new things!!  This comic adaptation is a good example.

Jenifer is lucky, it seems that every time a man realises how crazy she really is, another one is right there, just in time to save her and give her shelter. Then the whole pattern starts again! Sex, Cannibalism and moral disturbance until they get enough ... Sound a bit simple i know but its an awesome movie with all the right elements!

I know some people are still shock about some of the scenes in the movie but again, thats the whole point to it!  Whatever they say... anyway they've watched the whole thing didn't they? From a horror point of view this is a great film, acting performances, cinematography, enough shocking material to please any horror fan (or any very sensible persons). Definitely one of the best films from the ""Masters Of Horror"" series. Dario proved us once again that he can still shock  people after all these years! For anyone interested, the other short film by Dario in the masters of horror series is called ""Pelts"".  Not as sexy as Jenifer (yes, yes i know... from the neck down only...lol..) but should also please any horror fans!

2582783,5,B000FS2W3A,"This is not a typical Argento movie. In fact, if you watch it looking for Argento's trademarks, you may be a bit disappointed. But as a horror film, this is a perfect little piece.

The short length (just shy of 1 hour) and the strong story are the strengths of this movie - everything is tight with no lingering scenes. There is no mystery here - only the dread of realizing what is going on and the curiosity to see what the characters will do next. And the end, while predictable, is very satisfying.

There is this female named Jenifer in the film that at first you think she's a victum, then learn really quickly that there's something else wrong with her. Yes her face is hidious, but she has a great body. Guess it's true what they say that a man will do anything. Jenifer seduces a cop and he falls in to her trap. Jenifer is quickly transformed from innocent victum to demonic predator. There are a lot of sex scenes for a hour film and Argento gets the story out pretty quickly without wasting time. It just wasn't something I was expecting from Argento. I did like this film, but there could have been many directors who could have pulled this off. I was just expecting A little more from a famous Director. This wasn't even the best film from the Masters of Horror collection.

He also wrote the teleplay based on the comic.

2582797,1,B000FS2W3A,"I saw this movie in a store, looked at the cover and was intrigued, read the back and it made me buy it.
Watched it and as the end credits were rolling, my mind was scrambling for an answer to this movie, ""what was I thinking?"" I made my friend, who is also a huge horror-any movie buff and she thought the same thing as me. Confusion. Reading the back I knew there was gonna be some nudity (and heck i like porn so no biggie) but I really think that they worked harder on the sex scenes than the horror and story itself, cuz i really do think this is a intriguing concept and it could have gotten far. However I felt like i was watching some porn movie and it slacked (even for a porn). There's ways to subtly get the obsession and what not shown.
I was thinking also that I needed more of a story about her like obviously that there's something about her that the obsession occurs. Like, maybe she wants us to  think its because of her body but maybe she like radiates some chemical to make you a retard and so she becomes the predator as you are the prey about to get your innards ripped out.  And i just cross her being abused out entirely, you cant beat up someone that bad to make her face that ugly but leave her body like that. sorry but if Im gonna beat someone Im gonna do it in more than one area. I really wanted to learn more about her and to understand how she got to become. I loved the gore and her being so fantastically gross but to me there needed to be a deeper story.
I read where the person is like if you are a woman or gay you may not get it. And the person who's like that guy needs help. I don't think anyone needs help but trust me I'm a woman and i get it. I just don't understand throwing the life that you worked so hard to get and throw it all away for an ""thing"", ""it"", ""creature"", whatever you wanna call Jenifer? Than realize you need to get rid of her (because hey, look what she's doing to you) and you end up dead! You are dead now, bet you are wishing you didn't fall for her nice body now didn't you CUZ YOU ARE DEAD!! I think the people that rate this movie at a high rate enjoyed it a little too much with her body and technique, wishing they were getting some like that and to really prove that some males think more with that head than the actual head thats on their shoulders. YOU ARE DEAD and she's off having more sex and messing up with more people's life's...to me that sounds pretty crappy. This movie clearly shows how some males aren't being smart at all!!
And Steven Weber, i enjoy him but him in this movie...man oh man, i just wanted to slap him silly.
its a movie that confuses me and it makes me wonder why! but you got to have a not so good hit in your dvd collection. and this one is definitely, I warn people about!",1292371200,,2774,4.0510018214936245

Any viewer who did not feel that their intelligence was severely insulted by this nonsense must be as retarded as the girl was. I mean, I wouldn't have brought her home in the first place, but after she ate the family cat, I'm pretty sure I would've kicked her ass to the curb. And not even chowing down on a little girl's innards was enough to turn this moron cop off to her. Truly absurd, ludicrous beyond anything I've ever seen before.

One reviewer spoke of exploring the storyline of the girl possibly not being human?...(BOOORING)...Been there, Done that!

She knew exactly what she was doing when they were alone. I think she fulfilled many mens dark, politically incorrect fantasies of the perfect woman. She couldn't talk, she was very horny, with the loyalty & submission of a trained dog(referring to the seen when she attentively sat next to him & fetched him another beer after he threw his empty one away). If it wasn't for the fact that she was a cannibal with a grotesquely deformed face, she would make a great girlfriend. Is that wrong?(maybe). But that's what makes this film cool.

2582800,5,B000FS2W3A,"The ""Masters of Horror"" films have always been quite interesting to view.  Despite their short run time of 50 odd minutes each, many of these films actually contain more action and storyline/plot development than most full length films.  ""Jenifer"" is no exception.  The film manages to provide scenes of gore, and total brutality while still completely developing the eerie plot that's full of twists and turns at every possible chance that the film is presented with.

Directed by Dario Argento, the mastermind behind classics such as ""Suspiria"", ""Inferno"", and many other outstanding, timeless horror films, ""Jenifer"" is one of his best titles to date and is a great addition to his already stellar catalog of films.  ""Jenifer"" begins by depicting a team of officers enjoying a delectable lunch in their police vehicle.  Suddenly, Frank Spivey's lunch is interrupted when he witnesses a man dragging a young woman and attempting to decapitate the girl.  Frank warns the man to cease in his actions, but the man refuses, simply stating ""You don't know what she is"" while proceeding to raise his weapon.  Frank is left with no option other than to shoot the man.  The only thing the man says before dying is ""Jenifer"".

Down at the station, no one is capable of gathering any information in regards to the young lady who Frank saved.  The only information they have lies within a note the man had in his pocket that simply read ""Jenifer"".  Jenifer appears normal when the viewer is only capable of seeing her body, a very fine toned, slender, attractive body; however Jenifer is not normal at all.  All of the officers are shocked by Jenifer's appearance, stating that the girl must be deformed and mentally impaired, seeing how she is not capable of speaking and relies on simple grunts to communicate.  Jenifer's face consists of two large, solid black eyes and an extremely large mouth full of rather large fangs.

Frank becomes distracted and obsessed with Jenifer.  Unable to focus even while making love to his beautiful wife, Frank consistently pictures Jenifer in his mind, and fantasizes about her even when he's with his wife.  Upon discovering that Jenifer has been sent to a local asylum, Frank decides it would be better for her if he pulled her out and allowed Jenifer to live with him and his family.  It is here that things begin to take a turn for the worst.

Jenifer begins to grow violent, turning on the family's cat, forcing Frank's wife to leave him.  Jenifer's behavior begins to escalate out of control.  Dead bodies begin to show up at every turn, yet Frank cannot find the courage to leave Jenifer.  Her hunger for physical attention fills Frank with uncontrollable lust, and his cravings for her body outweigh his fears of what Jenifer has become.

Graphic, gory, and very sexual, ""Jenifer"" is a film that is capable of truly captivating the audience, especially anyone who happens to be a fan of horror films in general.  The story line is very good, especially for an hour long viewing experience, and the plot slowly shows the evil nature that lies within Jenifer and her libido that is capable of seducing men and leaving them helpless to watch her violent actions as they occur right before their eyes.  Dario Argento has created a dark, sexual film, that brings forth everything that a horror fan wants from a movie: blood, guts, sex, nudity, and a well played out plot.  The film never contains any unnecessary scenes, and all of the violence and sex does a great job of contributing to the overall story rather than simply being in the film without any actual purpose.  Anyone who's looking for a short, but spectacular film to view, any of the ""Masters of Horror"" films will work just fine, but ""Jenifer"" is a true stand out amongst its peers.",1282003200,3,3779,4.800618238021638
2582801,1,B000FS2W3A,"Whither thou goest Dario?

I am a Dario Argento fan and that
is why I acquired the DVD.
Why does someone with Argento's
talent put out a piece of exploitation
trash like this?
Watch ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" or
""Twilight Zone"" episodes as a point
of reference for comparison.

I felt abused by this episode of
""Masters Of Horror"".
It is an excuse for assaulting the
senses and the psyche with pornographic
images of both the sexual and violent
type.

The basic film noir-ish theme of a man
ruined by sexual obsession is a good
one. Made even more interesting due
to the object of the obsession having
a grotesquely disfigured face and as we
learn is a psychopathic cannibal
(this is masters of HORROR after all).

Do we need to see images of the
cannibalization of a little girl
or soft core sexual pornography.
The special features show Argento
apparently disappointed or regretting
that his original plan to have
Jenifer bite off and eat the erect
pinus of her teenage victim,
explicitly shown,
needed to be edited from the film in
order for it to be accepted

I think this film along with the other
Masters Of Horror film by Argento,
""Pelts"", proves that moral depravity
may be at the heart of Dario Argento's
decline as a film-maker.

The idea that the creature Jenifer
may not be a human being in the normal
sense or that she has some sort of
diabolical power is not even
explored although I am sure that
it occurred to nearly all viewers.

How can this be the same person
whose debut film so many years
ago is the great classic
""Bird With The Crystal Plumage""
and whose films include ""Inferno"",
""Tenebre"", ""Deep Red"" and so many
others, that while cringe-inducing
in their portrayal of violence,
are truly the works of a master
film artist and story-teller.

The plot and themes of this film
have potential,
but that is irrelevant.
It crosses that somewhat vague
line, but a line nevertheless.
As it is, it is trash in the
most profound sense of the word.
Like all trash, throw it away.",1274227200,2,2009,4.607843137254902

The guy she was with in the beginning didn't look like a homeless man to me-he looked like your average professional. Yet, he was repeatedly referred to as ""homeless"" and a ""derelict"". As the movie went on holes in the script annoyingly showed themselves. One minute Spivey is a police officer, the next he's unemployed and setting Jenifer up in an abandoned cabin in the woods. What?? I can say that the ending wasn't bad, all things considered. I also liked the movie's brevity.

Jenifer tells the tale of a cop (Steven Weber) who manages to save a young woman from being savagely butchered by a mad man armed with a cleaver. The women in question is named Jenifer (Carrie Fleming) and she appears to be built from the neck down, like a sultry bombshell, her severely disfigured face on the other hand is anything but photogenic. It appears the title character is a hellish, sex-crazed, blood-thirsty succubus who manages to secure a firm hold over the affections of the men who come into close contact with her. Our cop hero's infatuation with her becomes obsessive causing his downward spiral and leading up to a climax that many including myself saw coming from the first five minutes.

Although the story itself is predictable, very predictable, it still managed to hold my attention throughout as nudity, humor and gore abound and the film more than qualifies as an entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" series. I also liked that the origins of this She-Devil are never explained so the character remains an enigma and the viewer will be left with a lot of unanswered questions. Overall the performances from the lead actors are good which is somewhat surprising considering many entries in the series suffer greatly from bad to mediocre performances. Steven Weber's performance is solid throughout however in my opinion, Carrie Flemings performance stole the show. Although she has no spoken dialogue, she still manages to turn in a rather surprisingly effective vocal performance, she moans, groans, hisses, cries, growls, laughs, grunts etc all to good effect. She also manages to elicit some sympathy from the viewer and make the rather unpleasant title character sympathetic so kudos to her. What I also found interesting is that I being an Argento fan, would never have guessed he directed this film as it doesn't bear any resemblance to his earlier works with the exception of the musical score.

""Jenifer"" is definitely one of the more solid entries in the ""Masters of Horror"" series, many of which are too quirky, comical and lacking in any real substance and suspense. This entry is quirky enough, predictable enough, ridiculous enough but the gore, sex and yuck inducing moments will have the more squeamish viewers heading straight for the shower after viewing.

Though many of the illustrated stories made me shiver, none disturbed me as much as the Bruce Jones / Bernie Wrightson grabber, JENIFER. I never forgot it. Now, Dario Argento has put the tale on film. I like the way Steven Weber fleshed out the story, and his Frank Spivey character is believably bewitched. As for JENIFER herself (itself?), she is a gruesome wonder. Although Wrightson's rendition was more bizarre (especially those hideously dead eyes!), the movie version is still suitably freakish. She goes about her merry business of enslaving the unwary Spivey, then destroying his life, while eating various animals, neighbors, etc. Of course, this is far more adult than the original comic, but that's to be expected. JENIFER is graphic and extreme in spots, so don't let granny or the tikes get a hold of it!

Everything was bad.
The story was bad, the acting was bad, the directing was bad.
NOTHING was good in this movie. It starts of with a cop finding her, and than taking her home. His wife wants her out, but he keeps her.
Then she has sex with him, really badly done, eats a Asian girl and a cat, more sex, and eats a boy. Than he trys to kill her but gets shot.
It was the worst movie I ever saw, and I saw Beyond The Walls Of Sleep. Id rather watch that. Hell, id even see a Uwe Boll movie before I see this again.",1215302400,5,569,3.7107438016528924
2582814,4,B000FS2W3A,"This short work by Dario Argento is better than it's been given credit for.
You probably already know the story--a fugly chick that has an unquenchable sex drive and blood lust.  But there's also some provocative points you might have ignored or avoided.
Jenifer herself has been severely abused.  But because of her hideous appearance, very few might feel sympathetic.  With an unblemished face, the responses might differ drastically.
But since she does have a nice body, some men might disregard her facial disfiguration and feel a sexual attraction toward her.  Sick!  And when they realize how unstable and horny she is, at least one man is quick to take advantage.
This movie construes sex as both violent and empowering.  It's like an animalhistic rage that can't be controlled.  Dario makes a bold statement about the perverse sexual nature of both men and women, how we are hypocritical plus just blatantly stupid, and how we can be quick to disregard any moral implications in life.

So one question--
Who's the real beast in this movie, the man or the woman?",1212796800,3,1069,4.9

2582817,2,B000FS2W3A,"First of all, I am appalled at the reviewers who thought this guy had a good thing. That chick has got to be one of the most revolting I have ever laid eyes upon.
And seriously, Carrie Fleming's body is NOT fine enough to make up for that ridiculous face, or the character's ridiculous behavior. Any of the reviewers who even remotely think so, must lead a very sheltered life.
Honestly, I would not be able to function with someone who looked and acted like that! As soon as she killed the family cat and ate it, it would have been over!

The sick character in the movie and the others around this review board  who actually found that thing arousing say this, in so many words: That they would have had sexual relations with her. One guy said he would have ""done her"". Personally, I would have done her IN...whipped out the ol' meat cleaver and chopped that disgusting head right off of that mediocre body!

Way too many questions left unanswered, also!
Here's one: Why in heaven's name would the main character leave his family behind (pretty fine wife, too, I might add), for that stinkin' skank?
Here's two: Did  Jenifer even bathe once in that flick? After all that sex, she must've smelled like an escapee from a fish factory!  Pewwwwwww!
Here's three: Why didn't the main character's wife make some type of effort to find out what was going on after she left? One moment she's there, and the next, gone! Their marriage certainly didn't appear to be on the rocks!
Here's four: Why is Jenifer spelled with only one 'n' anyway?

Lastly, this farce was WAY TOO PREDICTABLE!!!!!
I knew the ending three and a half minutes into the film.
Garbage! Don't waste your time or your eyesight!

2582818,2,B000FS2W3A,"Dario Argento's first episode of Masters of Horror, Jenifer isn't a return to form, more not bad than actively good. It's a standard boy meets succubus story, with Steven Weber's cop saving an apparently mentally disabled and deformed girl from a homicidal psycho and is pretty soon actively proving the old saying that you don't look at the mantelpiece when you're poking the fire as his whole life goes to hell. Eating the family cat should have been a giveaway that it's not just her body that's built for sin, but even after she moves on to the neighbors' little girl he's still gotta have it...

The ending is predictable from the opening scene so this is one where the execution has to carry the lack of surprise but, while perfectly competent, it's never really particularly inspired. Still, it gets extra points for the playful riff on the opening of the Argento co-scripted Once Upon a Time in the West, replayed with two cops in a car eating a Chinese takeaway while a fly buzzes around them.

If nothing else, the DVD offers a huge number of featurettes, outtakes, interviews and Easter eggs.",1203206400,,1103,4.709844559585492
2582819,2,B000FS2W3A,"""Jenifer"" has a plot and ending that are extremely predictable.  Rather than character-driven, the plot is gore- and lust-driven.  It is a shame that the director is Dario Argento.  It is definitely not up to par with his earlier works such as ""Suspiria"" and ""Opera"" which are noted on the cover.  ""Jenifer"" proves that you can't go back in time.  This gore fest can not be compared to such beautifully filmed giallos as ""Deep Red"" and ""The Bird with the Crystal Plummage"" or such occult thrillers as ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno.""

""Jenifer"" is, however, more watchable than the other Masters of Horror episode that Dario Argento directed, ""Pelts.""  ""Pelts,"" believe it or not, was even more grotesque, and its plot more ludicrous.

""Jenifer"" is a fine example of the ""torture porn"" movies that I don't care to watch.  The scene where Jenifer bounds the teenage boy and eats on his intestines while he is still alive is deplorable.

Dario Argento needs to return to his gothic/giallo roots.",1202515200,3,986,4.885542168674699
2582820,5,B000FS2W3A,"The movie is the perfect mix of revulsion and attraction in one hour-long film. Personally, I think the cop (Frank) had the perfect situation but mishandled it. Think about it. A smokin hot blonde with a face that is a lil scary, combined with an inability to talk, a hunger for raw meat and an animalistic sexual appetite...TOO EASY! Jenifer's mixture of innocence and animal instinct reminds me of the siren story where the lusty sirens would lure seamen to their doom. Jenifer does all the same far too easily. And she does it while making you feel sorry for her and pitying her.

Well, The situation/movie could have turned out better if Frank had just kept a sane head on his shoulders. His family left him but he could have continued communication with them while he was with his new girlfriend. Yeah yeah yeah, she ate the family cat but I mean come on! The dude never fed her! Wouldn't you be hungry after a romp like that!? I know I'd be looking for a sandwich as soon as I woke up out of my romp induced coma! How could the dude expect her to be normal when he SAW how she ate the family cat!?! He should have kept his job and just locked her in the house all day and left her a few animals running around the house for her to stalk and eat. Then when he came home he could clean her up with a nice hot shower and take care of himself and clean up the house. He could take her out for a walk or to a park so she could get some air then come back home and eat dinner himself. Then relax a little bit before taking her to bed and making her howl.

There were a few parts where I wanted to know more...like, did she know how to dress herself, was she potty trained, who owned her before Frank, was she able to eat cooked food, was she teachable, was she a mutant or a demon, if she was a mutant who were her parents, was she just a disfigured abused female that someone kept in their basement most of her life, is she capable of true love or just animalistic companionship, who taught her to use her mouth without her shark teeth getting in the way?....all of these questions bounced around in my mind and they still do.

The movie is gore-filled, with simple but good looking effects - Jenifer is certainly disturbing to see - but intestines and blood do not a scary movie make.  The acting is decent enough, but the part that kills the movie for me is the atmosphere, or more accurately, the lack of it.

The colors, setting and music are all something that I would expect from an early ninties TV show on Sci-Fi, or even Nikelodeon.  Throughout the movie, I was imagining how much better each scene would have been with a much darker, nightmareish theme, more like Eraserhead, but not as frustratingly dull. Instead, we get cheesey, staccato orchestrations and arpeggiated synths with bright colors and predictable scenes, one after the other.

I don't want to say it was bad.  I like the story alright, and yes, there is plenty of nudity (call me crass if you'd like, I'm not ashamed to admit it), but 13 Ghosts set a better mood than this movie... and that's scary.

I was so eager to watch this one I cancelled everything to push it into my DVD player and sit backa and--watched in disbelief. What lost me from nearly the beginning was how could a sharp policeman suddenly become obsessed with such a grotesque person as this girl with the most hideous looking face since Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera. Yes, she does have a good bod but how could a guy get aroused with her--and especially after he catches her gobbling up the family cat and then human beings. She doesn't just chomp down on them. She rips them apart, entrails and all, and dives right in. Yet, the cop keeps having wild sex with her even though she can't speak but only makes gurgling noises and whimpers. You're never shown why the cop is so obsessed with someone so horrific that she looks like she came from another planet. He brings her into his home where his wife--naturally--is horrified.  The cop keeps this female monster even after his family leaves him and he loses his job.  He drags Jenifer around like a treasured family pet. He does get a little upset when Jenifer attacks and starts dining on another human and then the cop does finally get pissed off and he starts to use his axe on her when--no, I won't give away the ending but it's pretty well expected. I found none of Argento's touches in this very brief little film. There were no brilliant camera set-ups, usage of color, snazzy wardrobes, etc. It was like it was made by any routine director to fill an hour slot.

2582823,3,B000FS2W3A,"Italian horror master Dario Argento made his Masters of Horror debut with Jenifer, adapted from an old Eerie comic by horror comic legends Bruce Jones and Bernie Wrightson.  Steven Weber plays a detective named Spivey who saves the title character (Carrie Fleming), who just so happens to be a disfigured girl.  He takes her in to live with him and his family, which leads to Jenifer's devouring of the family cat, the family departing, and Spivey becoming increasingly seduced by the mysterious, vivacious, and incredibly hungry, Jenifer.  While Argento's stylistic direction is undoubtedly the best part of Jenifer, what really hurts the episode is the adaptation by Weber himself.  Plot holes and leaps in logic are abound, which will undoubtedly leave you scratching your head at what develops.  What does develop is so incredibly predictable that you'll know how it ends before the credits roll, but it's Argento's touch that still makes Jenifer worth checking out.  The gore effects are spectacularly grisly (and stomach churning), which are also reason enough to give this a look.

It is undeniably disturbing, but to what purpose?  Despite her spectacular body, I was unable to understand why Spivey and so many other men apparently feel so protective of her since her habits and her face are so thoroughly repulsive.  Perhaps it was the point that the nature of the human male is such that he is willing to overlook a great deal in order to have ready sexual access to a magnificent female form.

Along with Pick Me Up and Incident on and off a Mountain Road, Jenifer has all the makings of a horror movie classic.  Although the movie is a *tad* predictable overall, throughout the course of the story there are many surprises around every corner.  Numerous horror conventions are pushed to the side to create a very original work.  Although Steven Weber would not have been my first choice to play the main character, I thought he did a commendable job in a difficult role, as he was forced to go progressively more insane as the story chugged along.  Carrie Anne Fleming is perfect as Jenifer.  She embodied the strange mixture of innocence and fearsomeness that the character exhibited throughout.  Although she really didn't have any lines, per se, she got everything else right.

The gore and special effects were first rate, as they always are with Argento's work.  Nothing too over the top, but definitely enough to satiate even the most jaded of us gorehounds.

Actually, if you try to take her, she might just take you instead.  Here we have this mysterious person as beautiful as she is hideous who has no past and no identity save for the name Jennifer, which she doesn't even acknowledge--it is the men who find her that endow her with that name.  There is even the potential for a good theme:  sex and violence are arguably one side of the same coin (ie. Jennifer and the boy in the cellar); what exactly does it mean to be perverted if you`re not wearing a raincoat and hanging out at the schoolyard.  Unfortunately what we get instead is too much of the sex and violence, not enough story and the lingering question:  have we all been taken?  Now, I'm as much of a gore monger as you who are reading this probably are also, but on that same note, I don't like to have my intelligence insulted by self-lobotomizing stories whose plot resolution can be seen from a mile away.  Despite the caption on the back of the DVD case, the story wasn't also all that particularly funny either, unless watching an incredibly hot ugly babe having it on repeatedly with the cop who saved her is your idea of a good guffaw.  Add to that a major plot hole--are we truly expected to believe that the police officer who found her didn't investigate the crime scene area, or that the same will be done at the story's end???-- the size of the Arizona meteor crater and you have a mess of an episode.  The good points:  Carrie Anne Fleming-she did a fine job getting across some of the more subtler qualities of our creature without saying a single word in the process; the special make-up effects were eye-popping, especially with the Jennifer character.  The, ah . . . opportunities for development:  the story-Argento has directed some of the finest giallo films in the genre, but this was as suspenseful as watching grass grow; the gore-now, don't take this the wrong way!--despite the fact that Argento had a significant hand in the development of Dawn of the Dead, one of the most ballsout goriest movies of all time, this kind of lingering gore (Jennifer feeding) just isn't his style, as he's tended to focus more on the act of violence itself, as opposed to its after effects.  Dario Argento was and is one of the most important horror directors of our time whose recognition stateside has been long overdue.

Enjoyable and fairly gory horror comedy from Italian horror master Dario Argento is not as good as the Masters of Horror episode of his called ""Pelts"" and is based on a comic book. The music score by Goblin's Claudio Simonetti is good here and creepy like his scores to ""Dawn of the Dead (1978)"", ""Tenebre"" and ""Demons"" and the gore effects by Robert Kurtzman are quite effective especially the sequence where Jenifer is ripping and eating a cat alive.

2582836,1,B000FS2W3A,"This entry into the ""Masters of Horror"" series is, by far, the worst I have seen (of about six or seven of them), a true disaster of a film. Or so I thought until I came here and saw the glowing reviews of so many other people. I am at a loss to understand what they could have seen in the film, so I'll try to explain my reaction and hope that those who read this review will read the more positive reviews and see which seem more in accord with their tastes.

First, the plot. Spivey, a police officer (Steven Weber) stops a man from killing a woman (Carrie Fleming) with a meat cleaver. Spivey shoots the man, who utters one word before he dies: ""Jenifer."" The woman turns out to be a deformed woman about whom nothing is known. Weber somehow manages to check her out of the mental ward and take her to his house, the first instance of a serious plot hole in the film. There, Jenifer eats the family cat, causing Spivey's wife and son to leave. For no reason that I could discern, Spivey makes no apparent effort to get them back.

What Spivey does get out of his relationship with Jenifer is a lot of sex. Why he would want to engage in sex with someone with cat breath is not clear. Jenifer has, it seems, some sort of hold over him, a hold that begins the moment he meets her. He does try to break free eventually, leading to an ending so predictable that it is obvious long before it unfolds.

In trying to reconcile the positive reviews of this film with my own reactions, I have gone over the film again in my mind and tried to figure out what there is to recommend it. The film is shot well, but the cinematography is not spectacular or even especially noteworthy, especially when compared to some of Dario Argento's earlier, better-known work (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B00005ASOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>). The acting is competent, but the characters are so flat that there is little either principal actor can do with his or her role. Weber, for instance, never fully conveys why his character would choose Jenifer over his family, and Fleming is even more limited since her character does not speak. Indeed, Jenifer seems only to growl, eat, whimper, and have a lot of sex. There are some nice homages throughout, notably to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho/dp/0783225849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho</a>&nbsp;(or, more precisely, Bernard Herrmann's magnificent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/score/dp/B000001502/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">score</a>) and to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;(the scene in which a girl throws flowers into water). But allusions are not enough to save this film, at least not in my view.

Obviously, there are many who disagree, and I'm glad they found this film to their taste. For me, however, ""Jenifer"" really does rank as only 1 star.",1175385600,26,3081,5.493670886075949
2582837,3,B000FS2W3A,"Dario Argento, Italian master of filmic suspense and artfully choreographed horror, took the helm for this weird and wonky installment of Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" series.

The tight little teleplay (which does a lot with an economy of dialogue) was written by Steven Weber, who also plays our lead, officer Frank Spivey.  In the first five minutes of the show, Frank kills a fly with a newspaper and then kills a crazy-eyed businessman with a bullet.  You can't blame Frank; the businessman had a butcher knife and was about to go all Dahmer on a poor whimpering blonde girl.  (I'm not sure what implicated the fly; after all, it was only doing what flies do ... maybe that's important, or maybe I'm reading too much into it.)

The blonde girl turns out to be horribly disfigured and incapable of normal human communication.  A piece of paper found on the businessman's body says, simply, ""Jenifer.""  Feeling in some way responsible for this malformed girl (and drawn to the milky curves of her body in spite of her ""Butter"" face), Frank takes Jenifer into his home.  This bothers his wife and son, especially after Jenifer turns their pet cat into dinner.

Yes!  Jenifer is a horrifying she-beast!  Or, actually, she's just a primitive version of anyone else: her primary goals are to eat and mate, eat and mate, and that is essentially this film.  It just so turns out that Frank, subsumed by both guilt and lust, lets Jenifer drag him down into her primally satisfying (and disturbing) world.  He offers up a modicum of protest (Oh no! Jenifer killed again! That nutty Jenifer!), but one gets the feeling that it's only for show.  Weber does a good job of portraying a man who's sanity is succumbing to Id-like destruction, but the flick flags because of the pacing and the all-too-predictable ending.  There's only so many times that the Sex-N-Kill, Sex-N-Kill algorithm can loop before it loses all meaning, or at least all intrigue and suspense.

****NIT-PICK ALERT****

I had to say this: no one else has.

Jenifer, essentially, seduces Frank.  He drives her to the bay to dump her off in the woods, long before she's taken over his life.  This is where she first makes a pass at him, and they make sweet mutant love in his car.  What's my nit-pick?  Thanks for asking; I'll tell you.

Frank initially repels her advances, but she finally sways him with what, as far as the filming shows us, is amazing oral sex (some of this scene had to be deleted to make it on air -- a first for the series; the excised portions are on the DVD).  My problem is that Jenifer's abnormalities would make, I imagine, for a very painful bout of fellatio.  That is, her mouth is frozen in this teeth-bared rictus; she is incapable of closing her lips together.  I'll accept that Jenifer is strong and violent and loves raw meat; but I refuse to accept that she's good at giving ... uh ... that.

Like I said, a bit of a nit-pick.  Especially for a TV show that appears to require some form of nudity in every episode.",1175126400,3,3011,4.619585687382298

The biggest problems that held him back were, in my opinion, bad scripts and horrible dubbing. His visual excesses let him get away with it for a while, but eventually even his trademark flourishes couldn't save him. Shoot in English or in Italian I always said..... the multi-cultural casts and cheesy dubbing became unbearable.

With his latest work, Jenifer and Pelts, it is a relief to see him backed by solid scripts, good acting and decent production values. In fact, cable TV has let him go further than theatrical ever did.

2582839,4,B000FS2W3A,"Masters of Horror: Jenifer (Dario Argento, 2005)

Dario Argento has made some deeply, deeply twisted movies over the years. I've loved most, if not all, of them. Most are just plain fun. Some are disturbing in that kind of ""ooh, wouldn't that be creepy if it were really happening?"" way. Argento distances the viewer from the creep factor most of the time with his operatic method of directing.

Then came Jenifer, where Dario Argento switches gears and comes up with, hands down, the most disturbing, brutal, ugly, misogynist, hateful, offensive, disgusting, haunting, realistic, scary, thrilling, absorbing film of his career, his most beautiful since Suspiria and his most brilliant since Profondo Rosso. (As a side note, it also makes me wonder: if they actually showed this one on television, what on Earth did Takashi Miike do that caused them to yank Imprint?) This short film will knock you out of your chair and send you sprawling across the floor with a bloody lip and a sense of moral outrage, but you'll still not be able to tear your eyes away, and in the end you'll fall in love with it. Because you have no choice. Once it sinks its hooks into you, it will not let go.

Frank Spivey (Steven Weber, recently of The Shining) is a cop who interrupts an attempted murder-- a crazed man (The New Beachcombers' Kevin Crofton) is about to hack up a girl with a meatcleaver. Spivey kills him, and when he goes to rescue the girl, Jenifer (The Tooth Fairy's Carrie Anne Fleming), he finds her face horribly disfigured, yet the rest of her is perfect. Spivey, caught in the throes of a combination of lust, revulsion, and sympathy, starts to realize that Jenifer is, perhaps, not the innocent victim he thought-- but by that time, it's too late.

If there is one word that can be used to describe Jenifer, it is ""explicit."" (In fact, two scenes were cut from the final print; both can be seen in the DVD extras, and they are without doubt the most explicit things I've seen in a non-X-rated film.) The movie (for Argento tells us he did not approach this as an episode of a TV series, but as a short film, and that's how it comes off) is awash in both sex and violence, and in a way that's more aggressive than in most of Argento's work. (That's saying something.) But if that were all there were to this movie, it would be just another exploitation flick pushing the knife in. What twists it up into your guts is Jenifer herself (for those reading this on Amazon, where italics aren't allowed, above I was talking about Jenifer the movie; here I'm talking about Jenifer the character). Jenifer is a nasty piece of work, to be sure, but there's never any indication that she's malicious; she does the things she does out of far more primal emotions-- love, loyalty, jealousy, curiosity, confusion, hunger. She does what she's been taught. In her way, Jenifer (the character) is the distillation of the collective intelligence and will of every zombie in Romero's Dead quartet; she is, in some primitive form, us. And that's what will make you recoil in disgust and keep you riveted at the same time. **** ",1173052800,2,3110,4.647272727272727

And what is with some of the directors they have doing this now!! Even William Malone of ""Fear Dot Com"" gets a go!! Masters my arse. In this episode the only thing remotely good i can say about it is Jenifer's make up is truly hideous and scary to look at it. The plot and acting are equally as scary. How anyone keeps giving Dario money to churn out this cornball rubbish is beyond me. I am a loyal horror fan but this franchise has lost me. I purchased all the episodes so far and only have liked about 3 of them. Enough is enough.

The mute, deformed girl works her way into his heart and life, and quickly he learns that while she's willing to share herself and her life with him, she will require his life, body, and soul in payment.

Jennifer isn't the best out of the Masters of Horror line, but admittedly, other movies in the series have set the bar very high. The movie is funny in places, tragic in others, and down right twist-your-stomach gory. It's a morality play in a twisted sense, and well worth spending the time and money to watch, if you don't mind formula movies. My only complaint was the sheer number of nude and sex scenes with Jennifer. I'm not a prude by any means, and I have seen hundreds of horror movies so I know boobs are almost required in these. Still, it almost appeared that at times the director needed to fill in time, so he just threw in yet another sex scene.

All and all, with it's well executed special effects, twisted little ending, and interesting camera angles I would recommend this horror movie to those of us who grew up on Tales From the Crypt and Night Gallery.

This award winning  tale illustrated by the great Bernie Wrightson has literally haunted me for years (as it did Steven Weber it seems).  I had always hoped that it would one day be made into a feature film.  Well, this DVD is not quite feature length, but I'm glad someone finally took on the project anyway.  For fans of the comic, you may be a little disappointed.  This movie just doesn't get under your skin like the original story, but it's still not bad as the same plot is still there.  For those who never read the comic, this is still not a bad watch.  Very gory, very sexy, and comical at times.

2582843,5,B000FS2W3A,"While most Argento fans will probably regret that he isn't doing nowadays what he did twenty years ago, they are completely missing the point with this, his first effort for the Master of Horror series. Argento is a director who actually keeps renewing and changing with the years instead of churning out the same stuff he has done over and over previously. And this time he really goes way over the top, even giving Lucio Fulci a run for his money. To those out there thinking that Eli Roth or Miike Takeshi are outrageous, you haven't seen anything yet.

It's a pity that Americans get so easily shocked by some nudity and put down this film for the great amount of sex it includes (which by the way are essential to the story). Even sadder is that some scenes of oral sex were considered too much for American TV viewers and so were cut off (you can see them, though, on the documentary by Argento, included in the DVD).

Contrary to some others fan's beliefs, Argento actually chose to adapt this story himself, having seen it in an old issue of Creepy (not Eerie). The original story is probably Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson's best effort ever.

All in all this is the best film so far from the Masters of Horror series(at least from the first season), and Argento is still the MASTER. That's why I give it 5 stars.",1170288000,2,1323,4.481327800829876
2582844,3,B000FS2W3A,"After police officer Frank Spivey saves a disfigured young woman named Jenifer from being killed, he takes her into his home and begins a dangerous love affair with her. (Okay, so I know this has been reviewed a million times over, but I will address issues not previously covered by others.) When Frank later returns home after killing a man and saving Jenifer, he is seduced by his wife. At first, her advances turn him off, but then he is plagued with flashbacks of the dying man and a helpless tied up Jenifer. This makes Frank become sexually charged and aggressive towards his wife. In an ambiguous move on the director's part, it appears as though he rapes his own wife. Later, you will find him sinking to new lows with devastating consequences.

I could not help but notice the many similarities to David Cronenberg's Crash. There is an emphasis on the weird attraction we may feel towards some things that should repulse us. The nude & sex scenes show a heavy contrast between what is beautiful and what is disgusting and as it turns out, there is a thin line between the two.

I have read some other reviewer's opinions and they seem to state that their interpretation of Jenifer is as a monster or severely disfigured woman. Some even called her an ""alien"". My personal opinion is that she is none of the above. I think that would be missing the point of the film. I believe that Jenifer is not a human, but rather a manifestation of man's desire. Inevitably, all the men lose their wives, children, jobs, freedom, and eventually their lives. It is a cautionary tale to all stupid men, uh, well, I guess all men. The good news is that Frank pays for his stupidity in the end. Actually, things come around full circle. And I have to admit, I laughed.

Like a typical Argento film, he covers much ground here. Besides the obvious comparison to ugly and beauty, he takes a look at a corrupt police force. When the man that attempted to kill Jenifer has his nice clothes searched, but found missing an ID, he is written off as a homeless person. It later turns out that he was wealthy. When Jenifer is rescued, she is considered retarded and admitted to a mental institution because ""that's the system"".

While the story itself is great and tackles bizarre subject matter, my biggest complaint is that the nudity goes way overboard. I got the point about 5 nude scenes in. I don't need a paint by numbers cheap porno where the partners switch positions repeatedly. Top, bottom, side, car, bed, cabin, etc. It got very boring, very quickly. Plus half the time the nudity made no sense at all. For instance, if Jenifer is showering in an institute, Why is a male orderly and a male stranger allowed in there to gawk at her? Why is Jenifer walking around naked at Frank's house in front of his wife and young son and no one bothers to cover her? Another thing that didn't make a lot of sense was when Frank quits his job to live in the woods with Jenifer. Why not just hide her there and visit? Okay, to keep an eye on her and bone repeatedly. Fine. But wouldn't his wife and son report him missing? Um, there is such a thing as child support. He cannot just run off with another broad and not expect people to come for him.

Clocking in at a full 58 minutes, the film features great SFX (and in case you missed it, nekkid people). Claudio from Goblin supplies the soundtrack.

Weird Fact: This was the only Season 1 episode to require cuts. 2 shots were removed involving graphic depictions of oral sex. The first one occurred during the awkward sex scene in the car and the second occurred at the end of the film. The deleted scenes are edited into the 'So Hideous My Love' documentary on the DVD, which somehow I completely missed. Uhh, I guess I don't know oral sex when I see it. Or maybe I accidentally skipped over this. Or I got tired of watching this and did something else.

Favorite Quote: Police Chief, ""If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck with a meat cleaver."" DVD Extras: Interview with Director & Cast, Commentary, Stills, Bios, Trailers, and the Screenplay on DVD-ROM.

Bottom Line: An honest look at disturbing subject matter. Incredibly sexual, while lacking in extreme gore and devoid of any scares.

2582846,1,B000FS2W3A,"So, the reason this gets one star (besides the fact that you can't give zero stars) is because it's a made for TV movie, and so you have to give it some leeway as to how bad it's going to suck because of that.

That said, Jenifer is an all-around terrible movie (well, hour long made-for-tv movie). The story is pretty predictable, and really just an excuse for weird pseudo-porn scenes with a woman who has a horribly disfigured face and a great body. Aside from Steven Weber, the acting is terrible, and I usually excuse that because of a bad script, but this bad acting went beyond that. I really feel sorry for the actors involved because it's obvious they either weren't trying, or just haven't got the experience or skill to pull off the scenes.

Basically, a cop, Weber, sees a man about to kill a woman with a cleaver and shoots the guy to save her. Then he finds out that she has a horribly disfigured face (and a horribly disfigured mind as well). What follows is cinematic garbage with illogical plot lines and strange jumps in time that can only be explained by a low budget and a 60-minute time frame. It's really not even worthy of an hour on TV, much less a DVD release. Even if you're a huge horror fan, which I am, steer clear of this one.

The film follows the plight of a cop who stumbles apon a crazed man trying to decapatate a woman by a river. The cop proceeds to shoot the man and save the damsel in distress. Sounds like the beginning to a nice love story right?...no. The cop is shocked to discover that the woman is horribly disfigured, sporting a pair of huge black eyes and razor sharp teeth. After failed attempts to get rid of her, the cop brings her home where Jenifer displays her terrible manners by eating the family cat. This doesn't sit well with the wife and she leaves before losing her lunch. With the wife gone and being in a nice big house alone with Jenifer the cop soon finds that Jenifer is amazing in the sack. (except for a few minor turn-offs like her twisted face and the fact that she sounds like an elephant)He begins to find that he is hopelessly addicted to Jenifer's passion and as that addiction grows so does Jenifer's murderous hunger for blood.

I loved the symbolic ties between the characters (The cop slowly having his life distroyed by sex addiction and Jenifer, the seductive sucubus who's disfigurement reflects in a way her own nature but also the horror that she enflicts in her victim's lives.

About the best thing in this hour-long production was when Jenifer was shaking the house cat back and forth in her mouth, and the cat was shrieking loudly in pain and fear.  You could tell that it was a stuffed animal, and it was funny enough to get me laughing out loud.  Don't buy this DVD without first viewing it.

2582850,4,B000FS2W3A,"Based on an old Eerie comic illustrated by Bernie Wrightson, this is an eerie tale that plays against a number of emotions.  The story starts with a police officer who sees a man try to kill a woman.  He shoots the man before he can cause harm.  The rescued woman is Jenifer.  She has a disfigured face, a killer body, and seems unable to talk.  But no sooner is the case open than the detective begins to become obsessed with Jenifer.  He visits her at an asylum and decides she needs compassion and friendship so he brings her home.  This causes new trouble.

With Jenifer in the house things quickly fall apart for the detective's family life.  Then he discovers that Jenifer has a very active libido and has targeted him.

Also in my opinion, this episode was one of the best of series because I am a fan of the director Dario Argento.  His movies (although sometimes schlocky) are filled with dream-logic and symbolism that set them apart from the waking world of logic and make them like a nightmare from which you cannot find the door.  In this episode, you might relate if you've ever dropped your defenses for a woman who makes you feel protective and who keeps you so obssessively happy in the bedroom you cannot see the bad side in her that all of your friends warn you about, until it is too late.  For fans of the horror genre in general, to understand where his movies bubble up from, I recommend renting the Suspiria special edition and watching the special features.

Also in my opinion, blah, blah, blah....",1159142400,2,1196,4.458715596330276
2582852,3,B000FS2W3A,"Dario Argento, master of the Italian ""Gialli"" and one of the most celebrated horror directors of all-time, needs little introduction to the well-versed horror fan.  Early in his career, he delivered classic film after classic film, too numerous to mention but some of them include ""Deep Red"", ""Suspiria"", ""Phenomena"", ""Tenebre"" and the list goes on.  Unfortunately, the last 15 years have not been so kind, as he has been mired in a bit of a slump.  Every film since the decent ""Trauma"" (1993) has been somewhat lackluster, with the low point of his career being 1998's atrocious ""Phantom of the Opera"".  But I digress.  His works throughout the 70's and 80's are gold and we will always treasure his cinematic output of that era.  While ""Jennifer"" can hardly be considered a return to form, as some reviewers have dubbed it, it is a decent piece nonetheless.

Writer/actor Steven Weber stars as weary cop Frank Spivey, whose life and sanity are destroyed by a fateful encounter with a young girl.  Frank interrupts what appears to be a murder-in-progress: a crazed maniac wielding a meat cleaver over a bound, helplessly cowering female figure.  Frank has just rescued ""Jennifer"", a mute girl with a killer body but who has a horrifyingly deformed face.  Confused by simultaneous feelings of repulsion and sympathy that course through him, Frank takes the girl into his house once he discovers that she's homeless.  He has fallen under Jennifer's morbid spell, as the girl systematically destroys his will, his sanity, his family, and his life.

While ""Jennifer"" cannot be considered terrible, I would still have to rank it as one of the lesser episodes of the strong first season of ""Masters of Horror"".  It has the thinnest and most predictable plot of the episodes I've seen, as the ending can be spotted a mile away.  However, this is somewhat compensated by the generous amounts of graphic sex, violence and pure perversion.  The sex sequences are amazingly filmed, since they combine feelings of both excitement and disgust.  It has some exploitation elements euro-horror fans will adore.

Jennifer herself is a study of contrasts; she has a stunning body but her face is hideously deformed.  She genuinely appears to be a pathetic, withdrawn creature who just wants to be loved yet her ravenous appetite for flesh makes her evil incarnate.  As a viewer, we're not quite sure if we're meant to sympathize with her or to loathe her.

Maybe this episode was not all that it could have been since it was not written by Argento, but by Weber.  Or maybe Argento's time as one of the premier horror directors has long passed and his output from now on will likely never surpass the ""decent"" threshold.  Bottom line is ""Jennifer"" just didn't click with me, it's not horrible but at the same time it's not very good either.  Although some of Argento's trademarks from his earlier movies are here, the excellent camera work, the creepy children's music, and bugs flying around, this piece further goes to show that Argento is losing his touch as the story drags on and doesn't offer much to the viewer save for token scenes of cannibalism, sex and gore.  Argento is on board for an episode of season two so let's hope he can reverse this downward trend he's been on, although I doubt that will happen.",1158624000,3,3299,4.839572192513369
2582853,3,B000FS2W3A,"ok. a lot of people are bashing this flick (M. E Grant) so i gotta speak up. this movie was a fun ride from start to finish. jenifer is a tale of kindness, lust, obsession, and ultimately insanity packaged into a 1hr time frame for the MOH series and based on a very short comic strip. Making a movie based on a short is no small task and actor/writer Steven Weber should be applauded not insulted.

Listen people, there is only so much character development you can place into a 1hr time frame. I thought the dynamic between the cop and jenifer was fantastic. Characters outside this relationship are less developed- but one accepts fully where they are coming from and what their motivations are- and when/if they are harmed there is a definite sense of dread and fear.

Finally, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with gore in the MOH series or in horror films in general. Gore has absolutely nothing to do with the ""lowest common denominator"" as there are no 'rules' for making a horror film and as such no gauge for a highest or lowest denominator.

M. E Grant- chill out man! (i would have wrote you personally but i can't figure out how to do that....)",1157414400,4,1158,4.504761904761905

JENNIFER had most of the things I like in a horror movie. It made me yell at the characters, it creeped me out & It left me satisfied. Not the type of movie that makes u jump out your seat with the typical startle tactics used by some horror movies, but a movie that keeps you glued with a good creepy story.",1455062400,,486,4.020618556701031
