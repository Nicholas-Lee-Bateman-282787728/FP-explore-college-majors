5996360,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"As a big fan of the show,I had tried many of the Biggest Loser dvds but never really loved any of them and recently sold all my Biggest Loser,Bob Harper and Jillian dvds because they all had major dread factor after awhile. This new dvd is definitely a keeper-I loved every one of the segments and worked up a serious sweat. I'm an intermediate to advanced excerciser in my 40's and I had to modify slightly. This was Challenging but fun at the same time and I could not wait to use it again! I was never able to say that about any Bob Harper dvd!!While his dvds made me feel as though I had a great workout,they were just so monotonous and they just did not motivate me to use them again. I did not purchase the last 4 or so Biggest Loser dvds because of bad reviews but this one is worth every penny!!",1393977600,3,803,4.153846153846154
5996361,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"It's kicking my butt; exercises may look simple, but doing them...not so simple. Want a good workout, this will give you one!!",1392940800,2,126,4.7727272727272725
5996362,4,B00FKTCZ3G,"This is a good workout DVD -- it's very challenging and I like that.  At times it's hard to follow the directions because they come a little to late.  Regardless, I would recommend this DVD to others.",1392163200,,200,4.378378378378378
5996363,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"I received the DVD two days ago. I rushed to start the warmup with Dolvett Quince, and wasn't your normal warmup. I felt like it was a burn or 5 minute quick workout. Then proceeded with cardio 2 with Dolvett, and boy was I in for a treat of sweat, and much more difficult than their other workouts I've tried aside from the Power one (other ones are At-Home Challenge, 8 Minute Body Blasts, and Calorie Workout which Bob's are the worst to me) but I pressed through and completed in 15 minutes. Next proceeded with 3-4 minute cool down which is just that--cool! Easiest one yet and stretch those legs that burn so heavily in cardio 3 with Bob (did on day 3). Those 10 minutes are a beast at the very least! My legs are still burning after sitting down for 10 minutes before going through a 8-minute body blast workout up (up to 24 minutes). Cardio 1 isn't any slack or lack either, Bob once again, does his extreme, intense workouts and made me after day 2, want to go back to cardio 2 with Dolvett. Hopefully by the end of the week, will be able to do all 3 workouts with warmup and cool down, up to 50+ minutes altogether.

I try to do this workout with one of the other Biggest Loser DVDs, up to 30-75 minutes, at least 4 days a week to get results and feel great!

If you don't feel the fire, you are definitely not doing this workout or cheating and defeating the purpose! Your legs will burn baby!

5996364,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"Let me start off by saying that I don't normally write reviews (actually, this is my first time), but I am a workout DVD junkie, and really felt the need to write one for this. I have been working out for 2 years now with multiple DVD's such as Biggest Loser CardioMax, Boot Camp, Jillian Michael's BFBM, 30DS, and Bob Harper's Total Body Transformation, Cardio, ect.  I have done MANY.

Anyways, when I ordered this DVD I was worried, as it didn't have any reviews yet, and the Biggest Loser DVD's tend to be a little too easy for me. But, was I surprised! This kicked my butt. Let me just say, if you are not a fan of push-ups, you may want to avoid. There are many different types/sets of push-ups throughout this DVD. You will see burpees. 90 seconds of them, actually. Miserable. (I forgot to mention, I did all 3 levels on day 1)

I liked this DVD as it uses both your body and dumbells for strengethening while giving you a really good cardio workout. Overall, I really like this DVD. And am pleasantly surprised at how tough it is.",1389312000,33,1039,4.345360824742268
5996365,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"Picked up this DVD thinking that, for the price, I had nothing to lose. I've been working out most of my adult life and had been doing spin class at a gym three days a week and running on a treadmill and lifting weights two days. A couple of years ago I did the entire 90 days of P90X. In June of '13 a personal life issue arose which kept me out of the gym and mostly sedentary for six months, after which I was ten pounds heavier and had zero motivation. I'm 5' 5"" and currently weigh 145 lbs,

Since this is a Biggest Loser DVD, I suspected it would be geared to people who are seriously overweight, and thought I'd probably jump right in on Level 3. Fortunately, I decided to check out Level 1 first. This workout is tough! Did I mention I used to teach aerobics back in the 80s? I had no idea that you can incorporate lunges, weights and push ups in such a way that you maintain aerobic intensity sufficient to burn fat, but, I'm now a believer! I appreciate that the cast are real people, and not all svelte athletes. When I find myself flagging, I remind myself that these folks still have more than fifteen pounds to lose (my goal) and are hanging in there, which gives me the motivation to push through my desire to ease off. I've been doing Level 1 for four days now and can finally lift my arms without too much pain. I still need to push off with my hands when getting out of a chair and am walking stiffly, but I can feel my legs, glutes and lats getting stronger already. Very pleasantly surprised.",1388534400,54,1512,4.213793103448276
5996386,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"Great cardio workout. I did (2) Gold's Gym 10 min cardio workouts for about a month everyday before trying this DVD. I think I might have given up if I tried to do it as a beginner workout, its tough but you need to follow the person on the DVD who is modifying certain steps(then eventually you move up).  Its no joke and Bob is great, he walks you through each workout and motivates you through the TV.  You can customize your workout with different levels, warm up and a cool down with instructors voice and music or just the music.
Also try the Weight Loss Yoga DVD it is a great compliment to the 6 week Cardio Crush!!!",1473984000,,624,4.235294117647059

I started doing this DVD when visiting my mom and was hooked and ordered my own. It's a quick high intensity workout but anyone can do it and get good at it very quickly.",1452470400,2,273,4.169811320754717
5996394,5,B00FKTCZ3G,Way better than any machine. Keeps you guessing and very challenging,1450828800,,68,5.2727272727272725
5996395,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"This workout should more aptly be named The Cardio Crush Your Spirit and All Will to Live Workout.  The first time I did it, I was left a soaking wet quivering mass huddled in the corner and wondering what had possesed me to do that to myself.  Then it hit me....possessed...yes....I must have been posssed....

This is a good workout - pretty intense.  Who knew you could do pushups and jumping jacks all at the same time.  This is a worthy addition to my workout rotation, though I urge caution to all those taking this up, as this workout creates quite a fall hazards due to slippery floor conditions created by the pool of sweat.  You have been warned.",1441843200,2,656,4.470588235294118
5996406,2,B00FKTCZ3G,"This is not a beginner workout and the cardio is not steady enough, some moves are too hard to keep up with, find myself feeling discouraged every time he says the word burpee, tracked my heart rate and it kept dropping between moves, too hard if you have any back or hip problem, segments are done in an ineffective way. Really disappointed with this, I workout regularly and do weight training and I could not do this so buyer beware.",1441324800,,436,4.4625

5996408,4,B00FKTCZ3G,"Ok, the good about this video: The first level kicks your butt.
The bad: The first level kicks your butt so much that I don't know how you can continue with other levels. I'm a pretty fit person ( I run about 20-25 miles a week and workout). I ordered this via Amazon instant streaming, which was also a mistake. The reason I say this is because you don't have the option to customize your workout like you do with the DVD. So, I love the workouts, but I'm kind of surprised the first workout is level one as it seems to be the hardest to me. I also miss the ability to customize the workout. It's a great workout and I feel sore after I complete it - the kind of sore where I know I worked my butt off.",1425859200,,703,3.99290780141844
5996409,3,B00FKTCZ3G,"This was a lot more intense than I expected. I guarantee you will get into shape of you can do this workout but I was barely able to get past the warm up. If you are already in shape and you want to tone up more, this workout with fit your needs.",1425772800,,246,3.75

5996411,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"This dvd was better than I had expected!  I did the entire dvd at once which was about an hour long. I usually don't like to work out more than 40 minutes, but the time went by really fast.

Although the title of this DVD is ""Cardio Crush"", it's actually more strength training in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a cardio workout too, since your heart rate will be up.  But, it's more like a strength training aerobic workout.  I say that because the workouts contain many variations of squats, lunges, push ups, and did I mention SQUATS?!

I was drenched in sweat by the time I was done with the hour long workout (and I'm not a beginner).  I recommend this DVD for a great overall body workout!",1421625600,7,713,4.356060606060606

5996413,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"There are 5 options here- the 6 minute warm up (which isn't so much a warm up as a workout, in my opinion), 3 cardio blast options, and then the cool down.  I love this because it's something different from the usual BL or Jillian workout DVDs- mixing it up is always good with me so I don't get bored and my body doesn't get used to the same thing over and over.  Definitely recommend this to anyone who is short on time but needs to get a cardio workout in.",1415145600,,459,4.032967032967033
5996414,4,B00FKTCZ3G,Good work out.  Motivating.  Better than I expected.,1409788800,,52,5.375
5996415,4,B00FKTCZ3G,"Just finished level one today.  It was really tough.  I consider myself in pretty good shape, but had to stop for a break a couple of times.  I wanted a DVD that is cardio intensive to replace days when I don't get in a run; let me say I really do not like cardio DVD's, but this one delivers.  Definitely got my heart rate up in a fat-burning zone and kept it there!

PROS:  Great warm up, fun moves that get you warmed up and ready to go.  I like Bob Harper as a workout leader.  He is tough, but I like his personality.  He is not a jerk and doesn't say annoying things to the cast.  LOVED that it had real folks working out!  This is probably my favorite part - some folks occasionally fell out of the moves or stopped for a breath, which makes it seem very real.

CONS:  As another reviewer mentioned, it is really squat/push-up intensive.  I would have like to have seen a little more variety.  If you have any knee issues, level one is not for you.  (Not sure about the other levels).  Also, I like workouts better if the instructor is working too; as much as I like Bob Harper, he does walk around more than working out with the group.",1409443200,7,1143,4.146118721461187

5996430,5,B00FKTCZ3G,I love this workout. It is hard enough to challenge you but not so hard that you want to give up. Bob is a great motivator. I travel and take this dvd with me and do it in the hotel room so I can always get a workout in.,1400025600,,220,3.510204081632653
5996431,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"this workout is perfect for beginners who have not worked out for a while. easy to follow moves and instruction, yet challenging at the same time. great cast and crew",1399593600,,166,4.566666666666666
5996432,3,B00FKTCZ3G,"I was looking for a workout dvd for days when it's too cold to go out or there's no snow to shovel. (I count that as cardio.) Spring and summer I'm usually outdoors, so that's not an issue. I prefer workouts that have real people doing the exercises, not where everybody is already in shape and they use one of those people as a modifier. I chose this dvd based on that and because as I've seen from the show, I figured their workouts would be effective.

Cons: In this dvd, I felt there was too much ""lunge-squat-pushup-repeat"" going on. I understand you have to do those exercises to strengthen certain muscles, but it got boring (and annoying) quick. The grunting, too. I know that's how people work through the reps, but it was annoying too.

Pros: There's a feature where you can choose to have the instructor's voice present or not. I had to have the voice so I'd know the cues. I figure once you have the dvd long enough to know the cues, you won't need the instruction (but the music is boring.) I also liked the option to choose if I wanted to do a full workout or certain segments. There's real people on it, which I can relate to.
There's not a lot of extra equipment to buy. Just have some dumbbells if you want to add some intensity.

All in all, if you don't mind the lunges and such and it doesn't have to be a ""fun"" workout, it may be for you. The workout will have you sweating and hurting, but it was too boring for me.",1396224000,15,1437,4.237226277372263
5996433,4,B00FKTCZ3G,"I'm writing this still sweaty from only completing level 1, which I had to modify the hell out of to complete. Can't wait to see how my body adjusts to this level over the next few weeks.

8616446,5,B00FKTCZ3G,"I LOVE this workout!.  I purchased it on 4 6 2017 and have used it three to four days a week on average only doing level 2 cardio with Dolvett Quince.  Since doing so I have lost almost 80 lbs!.  After going through cancer treatment, my weight went to an all time high, I could no longer recognize myself and who I once was.  Well, I made it through the cancer treatment and had to find motivation again, while taking small steps.  I tried doing the video but being so overweight I couldn't make it through the first level.  I stopped and watched the remainder video and thought I really appreciated the words of encouragement in segment 2. I focused on level 2 I did exactly what Mr. Quince shared, ""Just keep moving!"" and have had great results.  He clearly shared no matter what your level is, be safe and just keep moving. His instruction and energy is very motivating, and being able to do it from my home, I turned up the sound and when it felt too hard, I just listened to his words and JUST KEPT MOVING even it it meant marching in place.  The first couple of weeks were hard, but by week two I could do a little bit more and even now since the start of my journey it still gives me a workout.  For anyone that may be just starting out, needing motivation with great energy and instruction along with simple but effective moves try this out.

I have many other Biggest Loser DVDs and they typically give you great modification ideas until you can do the regular moves but this one doesn't offer that as much. That's my only complaint.
