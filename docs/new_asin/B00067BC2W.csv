8039736,4,B00067BC2W,"Wow - very cool.  I was there the year they filmed it. I have to say that if you haven't gone to any of the Detroit electronic music festivals (now called ""Fuse-In"") and you want a feeling for what you might experience - this DVD will give it to you.

It's not a history of Detroit techno in any way, shape, or form.  I don't think that was the reason the film was made.  Instead it is meant to convey what the festival is about and the energy that you'll feel all weekend.  It's a promotional device, a souvenier, and an inticer.  In those respects, ""Movement 04: Detroit's Electronic Music"", works very well.  The footage is excellent - giving you a front seat and stage access to many of the performances.  Very well shot and edited.  It does suffer from some audio problems (questions during press interview segments are too low in the mix but I don't think the interviews were set up specifically for this recording).  IN addition, if you're not familiar with all of the artists you won't learn much about them.  While interviewed artists' names appear, many captured performances could benefit from seeing some note of who you're looking at.  I'm familiar with most of the artists by name, but not by face (the cliche of the faceless techno artist comes true here).

Sadly, they lost money on Movement and it has passed into the hands of Kevin Saunderson (shown during the press interview in a white t-shirt) who has renamed it ""Fuse-In"".  The festival is no longer free but it's still worth going to.

The extras are very nice as well.",1120089600,,1542,4.556363636363637
