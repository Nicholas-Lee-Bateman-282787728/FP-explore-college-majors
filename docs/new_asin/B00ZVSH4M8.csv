This judgement applies mainly to the more often performed quartets 2 and 3. It is also accepted that these are demanding works for the listener who would be best to approach them having previously become acquainted with other works of the composer and obtained some knowledge of his individual sound world especially as there are links within the quartets with other works either as structures or as textures etc.

Britten, as he aged, became increasingly intolerant of performers who deviated from his intentions with interpretations.  The 3rd quartet, written in the last year of his life when he knew he was fatally ill, develops this intolerance to the point of obsession. The following extract from Roger Parkers lecture script at the Gresham College makes this very clear  ..the score of this Third Quartet is extremely detailed in bowings, dynamics and other expression marks. Britten seemed to leave remarkably little to the discretion of the performers, and as if to demonstrate this further, he jotted down precise timings (timings accurate to the second) for each movement. What is more, we have ample evidence that the composer became increasingly intolerant of performers who strayed from what he considered the exact letter of the text. (Roger Parker  Gresham College series of lectures).

What the composer required in effect, was performers who had the technical capability and musical desire to deliver the notes as accurately to the written instructions as possible and not to deviate with interpretation, however gripping. This requirement is fully met by the expertise of the Belcea Quartet which has spent years promoting these works in numerous venues. Their audio-only recording on EMI from 2005 has been sufficiently regarded as to be a front runner in these works. Their performance to a small studio audience in Paris is dramatic and adopts frequently challenging fast tempi but all within the context of the written scores. Such playing communicates vividly through the visual medium as here.

This DVD has the advantage over their previous recording by offering nine more years of experience in performing these works as well as surround sound and the advantage of the visual element which is an undoubtedly useful extra in adding markedly to listener involvement. The recording, although only available as a DVD with no plans for a Blu-ray future issue, is clearly of HD definition and delivers both high quality sound and visuals. The camera work is detailed without being invasive or fussy.

The first two quartets come from 1941 and 1945 respectively and inhabit a sound world contemporary with other works of that period such as Peter Grimes and the Sinfonia da Requiem. The second quartet reflects Brittens interest in Purcell as a structural inspiration which is most obvious in the Chaconne of the final movement. The final quartet makes reference back to the opera Death in Venice with all the obvious emotional connections as well as structural considerations. The concluding, and disproportionately lengthy Recitative and Passacaglia with which it ends, is of a whole with that observation. Readers interested in considerable depth concerning these works are recommended to read the full texts of Roger Parkers three Gresham College lectures easily accessible on-line.

There are no alternative recordings on DVD or Blu-ray at present so such comparisons cannot be made. In the meantime this disc offers tremendously compelling alternatives to audio-only recordings of all three quartets in superb recordings.",1446681600,2,3714,5.293718166383702
