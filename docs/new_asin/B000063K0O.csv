1690993,3,B000063K0O,"Animation is good. Selection of girls (hair color, size, etc) is adequate. However, story is a bit confusing and fo the most part simply isn't there.",1317859200,,149,4.769230769230769
1690994,5,B000063K0O,"Caught this on Drive-In channel (which I love) and it's actually pretty dang good.

- it's got a plot!

- lots of beautiful women. Naked! (not nowaday silicone bimbos)

- empowered women! For instance, there's a great line in the movie, one of the best I've ever heard, where a rape victim gets the upper hand and asks the slimeball, ""what's wrong? All the romance gone out of it?"" Love it!!!

- lots of funny moments. I love the phil spector type famous music guy who they have to pull of one of the women and he's panting like a dog. Hilarious!

- Did I mention the beautiful women? Incredible natural bodies and one gorgeous woman actually has short hair, which I didn't think would fly in one of these 70's drive-in flicks.

Man, these movies, which were probably considered to be bad, even dumb, back when they were made, are so much brainier and more fun and waaay less offensive than the crap Hollywood passes these days. Hollywood movies are offensive in much a more slimey, insidious way. Many are just plain disgusting. Even the ""Go Girl!"" movies that come out these days are so obviously written by men and highly offensive.

God, the 70's was easily the best time to go watch a movie.

1690995,2,B000063K0O,"There's one reason and one reason only that I bring CANDY STRIPE NURSES to your attention -- its connection to another movie that's both more famous and rather infamous.  The opening credits for NURSES attribute the music to the duo of Thompson and Tabor.  It turns out that Tabor is none other than Eron Tabor, the actor who played one of the four rapists (Johnny, the gas station guy) in I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.  (My source is the commentary on the Millennium Edition DVD of GRAVE.)  Unfortunately, there's no way to tell how much of the music was composed by Mr. Tabor.  Also unfortunately -- but not surprisingly -- there was no attempt to enhance the soundtrack for the DVD release, and there's significant wow in the music throughout.
As far as the movie itself goes, it's an attempt to graft serious drama onto silly sex comedy, and in my opinion, the graft didn't take.",1070150400,4,875,4.583333333333333

The actors couldn't act, the story if there even was a story line, you couldn't really tell was so slow. I just couldn't sit through it, it was so boring. I turned it off half way through it. I would not recommend this movie at all!",1394150400,,351,3.9577464788732395
7959510,1,B000063K0O,"this is a 70s movie and it shows. Poor plot, and script make this hard to watch. There was some nudity. It was three different plots tied into one and the film lost my interest because it was not well written or performed....Not worth renting",1388707200,4,242,4.4
