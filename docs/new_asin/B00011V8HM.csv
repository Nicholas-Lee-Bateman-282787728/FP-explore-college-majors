SPOILERS- (if u can consider them that, becuz the movie is very predictable)

What was up with the cop trying to hit on Maggie Q while her mom was dying?! He had time to pull out his business card and everything! and why was he walking when he had a car?!

and Jewel Lee???!!! how did she die from some glass??? I thought she was the crazy one that could take pain?!

If you thought So Close was fake .. don't watch this one. it'll have u rolling!!",1093996800,,566,3.982300884955752
1965335,4,B00011V8HM,"Most of us watch action movies to see action.  This one delivers in spades.  The reality and cruelty of the training is a refreshing change from most candied US offerings.  The fight scenes were choreographed expertly and rival Matrix special effects.  Maggie Q has such charisma that she draws you into the movie and you can't stop watching it.  There's a scene where she's dancing for her victim and she takes off her underwear.  Then she tries to kill the guy but he knows in advance and gets the jump on her.  The fight that ensues has her twirling and jumping all over the place yet her slip never goes high enough to reveal the goods.  Is it CGI or just masterful camera angles?  I don't know, but it makes for some teasing fun.  If you have doubts rent it first and see for yourself.  I enjoyed it though.",1090800000,5,812,4.382550335570469
1965336,3,B00011V8HM,"NAKED WEAPON is the story of a group of young girls who are kidnapped by an evil madame (Alma Wong) and imprisoned on a secluded island to be tortuously trained into unfeeling assasins who lure their victims in with their bodies.  Those who try to escape will die.  Those who stay will one day fight eachother to the death.  Only one will be allowed to become the supreme assasin.
This is a pretty interesting variation on LORD OF THE FLIES type survival as innocent girls who form friendships with eachother must determine which is more important, friendship or life.  Those who rent the movie based on the sexy cover which features two attractive women embracing eachother while wearing nothing but camoflauge skin paint might be disappointed to find out that this isn't a movie filled with gratuitous nudity and lesbianism.  There is some brief nudity (by the beautiful Maggie Q) as well as some tantallizing strip tease type bedroom dancing, but the these are all quite tastefully done, and the two women on the cover are strong sister-like friends not lovers.
Highlights of the film include the wonderfully choreographed royal rumble to the death with the girls drawing numbers to see who will fight first beginning with two on two and the number of entrants increasing as each fight ends to take on the survivor!  This is where the director (famed action director Tony Siu-Tung Ching of DUEL TO THE DEATH, FIST OF LEGEND, THE SWORD) really shines.  The fights are high flying and lightning paced with each movement of action and emotion visible to the viewer's eye.  The best action scenes invovle not only beautiful movements, but actors that actually ACT in those scenes as well showing signs of human wear and tear such as fear, pain, and growing exhaustion.  You really see the girls go through these changes as the fights go on making you really root for your particular favorite to make it (although there's really only a few logical favorites to root for based on character screen time).  Other highlights include the chemistry between Daniel Wu's character and Maggie Q's (former real-life boyriend and girlfreind), and the climactic final battle between the top female assasin and a Japanese yakuza leader which should impress fans of MATRIX style gravity defying action.  Also those who hate dubbed films will be pleased to know that this film is in English with only a couple actors dubbed.
Lowlights include Daniel Wu's acting which is very limited.  While his scenes with Maggie Q are a real delight in their naturalness and truthfulness, he does NOT seem believable either as an obsessed cop or as a fighter (his fight scenes are good and his actions are fine, but the weak character he has given us make his fight scenes come completely out of the blue making them feel a little empty).  Other lowlights include the lack of screen time given to the other female characters.  Alma Wong doesn't have any fight scenes, Jewel Lee has no lines, and Cheng Pei Pei is horribly dubbed and also doesn't fight.  The movie moves a little too fast for any of these characters to fully develop relationships with eachother and with the audience.
I recommend the film to those looking for a fast-paced movie who like beautiful women in fancy fights that come fast and aplenty.  (There's a LOT of violence and some sexual content and this movie is definitely NOT recommended for children.)
Fans of female assassin type movies may also want to check out NAKED KILLER (this films prototype and superior), HER NAME IS CAT (in which Alma Wong gets to play the lead assasin), BLACK CAT (starring the lovely Jade Leung), and LA FEMME NIKITA (a grandaddy, or rather grandmommy, of its type).",1079222400,26,3690,4.824088748019017
1965337,4,B00011V8HM,"I saw this movie and I was surprised how good the action scenes were.  There is only english speaking in this Hong Kong movie, and there's no cantonese.  I thought the storyline was kinda interesting.  It's about a woman who was kidnapped when she was a kid and trained to be a professional killer along with other girls.  Then things changed for her during a mission in HK, when she was seen by her mother and caught by a CIA agent who recognize her when they were kids.  After that, there's some twist and turns in the storyline.  What I liked most about this movie was the action scenes.  There's a lot of cool martial arts fighting and unique killings.  Some of the action scenes are matrix like.  The fighting scene I liked the most was Maggie Q fighting Jewel Lee at the house, because of how the fight ended.  What I didn't like much in this movie was some of the music.  The music is kinda cheesy and some of the acting was weak.",1077926400,5,937,4.297142857142857

Much later, there is a ridiculous and awful rape scene, which I found particularly offensive, and irrational to the emerging storyline.

1965438,2,B00011V8HM,"WARNING: There may be SPOILERS below.....

I bought the DVD because the title had the word ""Naked"" in it.... JUST KIDDING. The cover is somewhat deceiving. It was an inexpensive buy at a local store, and the premise sounded neat. A woman kidnaps young girls (12-14 y.o.) and takes them to a secluded island to turn the little snots into assassins. Three of the 40 or so girls (the two main characters are named Katherine and Charlene) are selected (by death/elimination) to be the worldly assassins, usually as hired ""hit women."" They are held captive for over 6 years. The story comes down to a Japanese man who knows about the assassins which have killed his criminal comrades, and his seeking revenge. On a secondary level, the story (in the 2nd half) follows a Hong Kong police detective who has been attempting to uncover the reasons behind the disappearances of young girls, has fallen in love with one of the three women, and attempts to ""save her soul,"" so to speak.

Okay. This sounds like a pretty cool premise, even from the vantage point of a male, but what seems to be a really great idea quickly becomes just vulgar and violent, in both a realistic and ""graphic comic"" way. I enjoyed the island story, with girls pitted against girls to become elite assassins. There is even an interesting level of lesbianism (not vulgar, but almost a type of attachment between girls who have no male counterparts to help them). The movie then turns ugly, with a (predictable) wine-drugging scene and rape of the girls by steroid-filled American men (the island guards), while Madame M watches. The film then changes point-of-view from Katherine to Charlene - we follow one girl in the first half, then that POV changes to the other one. I quickly became disinterested when rape and subsequent unneeded sex scenes (the women prostitute themselves to weaken the men they assassinate) began. I mean, these women are SO good that they need strip for almost 5 minutes before bullets fly?! They could just kill the man without all the silly stripping scenes, but they are taught to use their sexuality to ""lull"" them before killing them. A parallel story about a police detective is just too ""graphic comic""-like and seemed totally out-of-place and nonsensical.

The one plot line that kept me interested is that of the sinister (to say the least) Japanese criminal who traps the one woman (I will NOT give that away), but it becomes silly with the gravity-defying fight scene that ensues.

The ending was predictable, as was much of the story in the 2nd part. I found the sex scenes gratuitous, and many of the ""green screen"" effects, especially in the fight scenes, had that terrible ""cloudy"" effect - a problem with special effects when they aren't done correctly. I understand that the corniness of the story is due to the graphic comic elements found in so many Asian movies nowadays, but the multiple stories seemed more to fill-in dead time. The movie would probably be 30-40 minutes if it weren't for someone just chocking the story full of unnecessary elements. Non-Asian (read: American) men are merely stereotyped comical buffoons or barbaric ""apes.""

I really tried to like the movie, and I did in the first half (up to the gang rape), but then it became silly. The women were quite beautiful, no doubt! However, it takes more than beauty to make a movie. Yes, I'm su re everyone loves Maggie Q, but I am not watching only for Maggie Q.

2 1/2 out of 5. Amazon will not allow 1/2 stars. There are sex scenes and some nudity! There is VIOLENCE (and alot)! This is not for everyone, but if you are into graphic comics from Asia, then you'll probably somewhat enjoy. It falls apart and becomes muddled in the 2nd half. The young girls do a decent acting job. The DVD has an English track and subtitled Japanese original track.

~Note: The movie is almost entirely done in English, so the all-English soundtrack is probably apt for viewing.",1355097600,3,3942,4.737609329446064

1965455,4,B00011V8HM,"Let me say right off the bat that I am a fan of action films, and unapologetically so. Oh I love and prefer to have a good or great story with it, but not at the expense of the action or action sequences. Most actions films seem afraid of the action, I guess to satisfy critics. Luckily for me, this wasn't one of them.

There are more than enough reviews to tell what the story is, so I feel no need to go there again. Few action films satisfy me more, than female kick-tail action films. This one delivers in spades far as I'm concerned. The female lead Maggie Q. was a joy to watch, and was her co-lead Anya. I thought both handled the action and fight scenes well, Maggie more so. Anya said she had no special training, but I thought she did ok. I thought all the women fighters did a good job in it though.

Makes no mistake about it, this is a violent film, with a rape scene that might shock or disgust some. Considering the overall violent tone of the film, it didn't seem that out-of-place to me. This is a film with plenty of hot-looking women in it, with just enough tease and sexiness to satisfy most hot-blooded males. The women even manage to be or look sexy when they are killing each other or many men. This is not a film for kids though IMO.

It's not exactly Othello, but I thought it delivered what it was supposed to. The great thing for me, is that it was done in English without any subtitles. I think there were a few dubbed lines, most notably by the actress playing Maggie's mom. It was nice watching a Hong Kong action film in English though. I hope that becomes more common. I've been hearing good things about Maggie Q., and I think I may have become a fan. If you like all-out female action with a decent story, you'll probably love this.",1253059200,2,1767,4.2373887240356085

1965457,3,B00011V8HM,"NAKED WEAPON is another foray into the ""girls who kick butt"" genre. Maggie Q has been getting a lot of attention in the U.S. for MI-3, Live Free and Die Hard and Balls of Fury; I have quite a collection of her Hong Kong films and this is the film that helped break her into the action genre.  Tony Ching Siu Tung directs and choreographs the fight sequences; the film is an entertaining mix of martial arts action with cool set designs. ""Naked Weapon"" is unrelated to Wong Jing's ""Naked Killer"". Wong Jing started the film but turned it over to Tony Ching in mid-production; the result is not the expected ""exploitation flick"" but pure action ""junk"".

Synopsis partially derived from the back cover:
Like a contagious virus, pretty and athletic girls in their teens are disappearing from all over the world. The mastermind behind the abductions if Madame M (Almen Wong), who plans to train the girls into cold merciless killers. After several years of intense training, only Charlene (Maggie Q), Cat (Anya Wu) and Jill (Jewel Lee) survive and become the world's best professional assassins. On a recent mission to assassinate some one in Hong Kong, Charlene crosses paths with her long-lost mother and as a result she comes face to face with a young C.I.A. agent (Daniel Wu), who vows to aid her in cutting her ties with Madame M.
However, the past threatens to catch up with Charlene and Cat....

It's quite hard to judge ""Naked Weapon""; despite the usual wooden acting (mostly by Daniel Wu) and the very stiff dialogue; I did kind of like the film. The film starts off strongly enough but gets lost in the middle with the usual morality lessons and the canned melodrama. Surprisingly, the film is shot in its entirety in English and I saw both the U.S. and the Asian releases; I was amazed how the U.S. cut was differently framed and edited on some scenes, the Asian cut showed more skin and nudity. (Especially in the shower scene with Cat and Charlene and the love scene between Jack and Charlene) I suppose the best way to describe the film's weaknesses is that while it contains the all the opportunity for ""exploitation"" it just uses them to provide wanna-be emotional sequences. Then, it turns around and shows a rape scene that most people may find distasteful; that it is a cheap shot to emulate raw violence. Looking at the special features, I rather thought Maggie Q, Jewel Lee and Anya Wu were a bit bothered by the footage. I guess critics may say that avoiding the obvious (if harmless) exploitation scenes but instead add a rape scene leaves a bitter taste in one's mouth. For me, I thought it was rather an attempt to shock and to express the cold, bitter world of the female assassins.

To the film's credit; Naked Weapon looks incredible. During the action scenes, there are more shots of individual shots than a good perspective view. The action sequences have the usual use of wires and trampolines that may look a bit over-the-top at times but darned if they didn't look sexy and cool. Realism is pushed out the window with the kinetic action sequences. The use of slow motion is used occasionally, and boy, Maggie Q sure looks awesome with the slo-mo action. Thankfully, Daniel Wu only have a very brief action sequence (he doesn't do them well). The film has its redeeming qualities: decent martial arts action, scantily clad beautiful women dancing, bullet ballet, and limited Daniel Wu screentime.

Naked Weapon has a very strong potential and there is always ""guilty pleasure"" watching ultra-hot women perform mano-o-mano fights in very ""short"" shorts and tank tops. The film is a visual feast for the eyes; especially for testosterone-driven males (like me). I rather expected more of Tony Ching. Despite the poor script, wooden acting and that it fell to the canned melodrama entrapment that falls like a stone in water; the film did redeem itself with the stylish fight sequences reminiscent of ""The Matrix"". The film starts off strong and ends with the usual climactic final fight; the film's lasting impression would be how cool Maggie Q and Anya looks. I still remember the very sexy posturing...

Recommended timidly; definitely worth a rental. [3  - stars]

VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 Anamorphic Widescreen. The U.S. and Asian release both share the exceptional video transfer with deep contrast, natural colors and strong blacks. The transfer is sharp and clean. What tips the scale in the Asian release's favor is that it has a powerful 5.1 DTS track that magnifies the viewing experience.

1965458,3,B00011V8HM,"Naked Weapon is one of those films that isn't very original, but still has a nice, may it be pretty weak, story and is very entertaining. It is a film with which actionfans won't be dissapointed and fans of sexy girls in action will absolutely love. There is enough gunfighting and martial arts in there to keep you satisfied.

The story follows Charlene (Maggie Q, before she got famous with ""Mission Impossible III"" and this years ""Live Free or Die Hard""), one of the many girls who got kipnapped at young age by Madam M (Almen Wong Pui-Ha), who takes them to a secret island and trains them to become the number one hitkillers in the world. The training is very hard and most of all brutal and not everyone will survive. When Charlene gets back in the real world, everything gets out of hand. When she sees her mother and gets in touch with the good cop Jack Chen (Daniel Wu) her life gets turned upside down and choices have to be made.

Yes, an interesting story even though it isn't that original. The movie only is 88 minutes and you feel that the story could have been worked out better. But still, it doesn't really matter. You must take this film for what it is: an entertaining actionpacked sexy-women-in-action film. And when you do that, this film will give you a very nice 88 minutes.

Maggie Q plays the mainlead and does an ok job. Her acting isn't fantastic, but with that beautiful voice and that look in her eyes, you'll believe everything she says and you'll believe that she means it. Also, I found her good at the dramatic scenes.
Daniel Wu is very nicely cast as the good cop Jack Chen. He plays his role in a fun way and even though also his acting isn't that great, it is, just like Maggie Q's, very pleasant to watch.
Anya plays Charlene's best friend and for me was the one that could have been better considering acting. She isn't terrible, but could have acted better. Still, she does an ok job and doesn't bother.
Almen Wong Pui-Ha as Madam M also isn't great considering acting, still, the way she does things as her character with a coldhearted look in her eyes still makes her pretty evil and hateable, in other words, believable as a bad woman. The things Madam M does to the girls sure is brutal and as coldhearted as it can be.
So, having read some reviews at different sites before watching this film, I had expected the acting in this film to be Horrific, but it wasn't that bad at all. Some surporting roles are pretty bad acted, but still, it's all part of the fun. The acting is good enough to keep you watching and having a fun time.

The action is well shot, watches easily and is good entertainment. You will be going from one action scene to another with some small quiet scenes in between. Seeying beautiful girls shooting and fighting there way through alot of guys sure is fun to watch.
Another positive thing to mention about the film is that some of the locations used are very colorful and nice backgrounds to the nice girls.

So overall a nice and actionpacked film that is pretty weak on story, sometimes a bit messy, but very strong on entertainment value. Just sit back, don't expect too much and see it for what it is: an average fun popcorn action film and you'll be pleasantly entertained. And hey, thats what it's all about right?
A film I will definitely watch again.",1183766400,,3327,4.456486042692939

Then, at their graduation dinner, the survivors are drugged and forcibly deflowered - more of their training. Training as assassins, trained to use their bare hands (and other bare parts) to disarm their assigned victims without them even knowing it, and to dispatch them.

There's more here than the super-assassin-babe genre's facade would suggest. Despite the gross artificiality of the environment that M creates, the girls form realistic jealousies and rivalries, but especially affections and loyalty. Combat doesn't create the conflict in this movie, but affections do conflict with loyalites.

Reading much into this movie would mean reading too much into it. Plumbing its depths won't take very many plums. Still, it's not just the stunts and wire-work that pull this one above the ordinary. You really want to like these charming and deadly women, not just because of the cute little girls they start as.

What do you get when you abduct little European and Asian girls and train them as stone cold killers? An exciting movie with a gripping storylines! All the makings of a quality production, right?

Unfortunately this film suffers from the same flaw many modern martial arts releases suffer from: the scenes which should be emotionally gripping come across as utterly silly. The formula of such films is simple: really bad dialogue, awful acting, absurd gruesome scenes or the combination of all of the above (like this film has). The further along this film became the more I was reminded that I was watching a foreign martial arts movie.

But I didn't give the rating I did because I didn't like it! Taking the film as a martial arts movie, I would go so far as to say this is certainly one entertaining film! The storyline is the true gem, if it sounds like you might like it - give it a rent - chances are you won't be buying it anytime soon but at least it'll entertain you.

The acting is what you would expect from a low budget foreign film and shouldn't be that much of a surprise. However it should be noted that the action is fast paced, the women are beautiful, and the men are utterly clueless!

3.5 - I wish I could give it a 4 but that would be misleading, I should note though that I very much liked the storyline and found it surprisingly memorable for such a low budget film (a film I would gladly watch time and again if it were on TV, but again I wouldn't spend my money on buying it).",1145491200,,1754,4.368098159509202

1965475,4,B00011V8HM,"This movie followed its cover synopsis to the letter.  Lots of hot young Asian ladies doing martial arts.  Actually, the techniques are so ridiculously gracious that they are great to watch.  Where else do you see cinematic application of Wushu moves, which are martial arts gymnastics cultured entirely away from combat application.  I guess that's what makes the ridiculous so enjoyable to watch.  You see the typical long fist and other wushu moves performed beautifully .

I'm writing this paragraph due to the other somewhat negative views on the rape scene.  After watching the girls culled by training over years (a few drowned youngsters are even pulled from the surf), killed in testing by guards, culled again to half in the open dormitory scene in which each girl must kill another to leave the building, culled yet again to three in weaponed combat, and lots of males, guards and targets, killed by assassins, some reviewers think that a rape scene is just too darn much.  That's a reflection of our modern society of the disposable male and protected female - all under the guise of gender equality.  Apparently, it's now socially acceptible to kill as many men as you want, especially on assassin assignment.  This movie has at least two scenes killing a naked man during a massage.  Well, I suppose modern social trends on gender-specific violence will be driving future legislation.",1134518400,7,1398,4.982758620689655
1965476,1,B00011V8HM,"When does a trashy movie stop being fun and start being repulsive?  I've been asking myself this question ever since I saw Ching Siu-Tung's ""Naked Weapon"" (2002).  Ching is one of my favorite action directors.  His credits include the underrated gem ""The Terra-Cotta Warrior"" (1989) and better-known actioners like ""The East Is Red"" (1993).  He also provided the fight choreography for several of Tsui Hark's films and Zhang Yimou's two high-profile martial-arts movies.  So, seeing Ching's name on the credits of ""Naked Weapon"" instantly told me that the film would be a quality product.  But I was not only disappointed -- I was revolted.

Now, I don't automatically fault a film for being a bit on the junky side.  Cult cinema certainly has its place, and so-called ""trash"" aesthetics can have their own positive properties that are as intriguing as the more ""respectable"" ones employed by more prestigious films.  So, just because some filmmakers might not take their subject matter seriously, or just because they might revel in the artificiality of their medium, that is not reason enough to condemn a movie.  Films that utilize trash aesthetics include many of John Waters' intriguing works and several enjoyable romps from Hong Kong like Luk Kim-Ming's ""Robotrix"" (1993).

But ""Naked Weapon"" crossed the line from trashy action movie to something more disturbing.  Perhaps we're not supposed to take the film's premise -- a secret Darwinian ""school"" for female assassins where the pupils must kill each other to ""graduate"" -- at face value, but the subject is viewed with a solemnly straight face, not with a cartoonish or ironic distance.  Coupled with Ching's fierce fight choreography, the bloody, nerve-racking events faced by the main character, Charlene (Maggie Q), are harrowing in an unpleasant way.  Like other films I detest -- such as Masaru Konuma's ""Wife to Be Sacrificed"" (1974) or Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Sal"" (1975) -- ""Naked Weapon"" seems to encourage its audience to take sadistic delight in its lead character's misfortunes.

This unsettling element reaches its pinnacle mid-way in the film when the ""school's"" cold-blooded leader, Madame M (Almen Wong), drugs her surviving graduates (presumably virgins) and has them raped by her male guards.  The scene is utterly gratuitous, and its gut-wrenching realism erases any ability to view the moment simply as a make-believe fiction.  The ""making of"" documentary that is included on ""Naked Weapon's"" DVD interviews Maggie Q and the other actresses after the rape scene was shot, and the women seem somewhat traumatized by the experience.  Why would a director want to put his actresses through such an ordeal?  For what purpose?  Furthermore, I would submit that the scene wants the viewer to identify with the rapists, rather than the women being raped.

Now, let me be clear: I am not arguing against all depictions of rape per se.  The aquatic rape scene in ""Erotic Ghost Story II"" (1991) and the invisible rape scene in ""The Eternal Evil of Asia"" (1995) were too over-the-top to take seriously as portrayals of violence against women, as anything other than bizarre performances staged for the camera.  And there are more substantial films about rape where the viewer is made to indentify with the victim.  ""Naked Weapon's"" rape scene is in a different class entirely: a humorless, realistic moment where the (presumably male) viewer is allowed to relish the sexual suffering of beautiful women.  Moreover, Madame M never gets her comeuppance in the story (suggesting that the rape didn't warrant punishment), and Charlene's climatic battle with an out-of-left-field villain implies that it was her ordeals with Madame M -- including the rape -- that enable her to prevail.  Rape, the movie implies, is a relatively positive stepping stone toward female ""empowerment,"" something akin to a difficult step in a Shaolin student's martial-arts training.

Some comments elsewhere on the Internet say that the rape scene in ""Naked Weapon"" shouldn't be taken seriously.  But the moment is played very seriously in this very serious film.  Others say that the scene should be taken within the context of the action genre.  I disagree: ""Naked Weapon"" is already a very grueling film about scantily clad women inflicting pain on each other in order to survive.  The action genre mandates neither the Darwinian violence of the ""student"" assassins against each other (I kept waiting for the girls to rise up against Madame M) nor the male viewer's pleasure in female suffering.  I'm appalled that anyone -- especially a director I respect -- would find this sadistic portrayal of rape and violence entertaining.",1129507200,25,4676,5.1686586985391765

A sexy female assasin dispatches her target and the authorities attempt to close in on her boss , Madame M.

Pretty interesting , and only because there is minimal talking from the actors. Things go downhill when the actors begin to speak , and this is when i knew this movie was going to be hard to sit through. The acting in this film is laughable. None of the characters are believable , and any sympathy the viewer feels for the girls will disappear when it becomes apparent they cant act. Not only is the acting deplorable , but the actual story is lame. It makes no sense why an assasination firm would want just one assasin when they could have an army. The Battle Royale aspect of the film has been done ALOT better by other films. When Madame M states the rules to the fight to the death in the cage and then later says she is going to break her own rules , i started laughing , and i stopped watching this movie when the rape scene came on , it was pathetic.

This movie is just tremendously horrible, a total POS.  There's a lot of copycat stuff from the trio of female assassins to bullet-time slow motion to acrobatic and aerobatic kung-fu fights.  There is no acting, no script, no substance, and not even much female nudity despite the tantalizing title.  (For your reference, nude scenes appear no more than 5 seconds added together.)  I was actually bored by this movie from start to finish, and ended up fast-forwarding through much of it.  I had picked it up (at Blockbuster) thinking it would be an entertaining mindless kung-fu movie with attractive ladies, but, even though the actresses are somewhat attractive (more so than the new Charlie's Angels?), the whole thing just doesn't add up to much of a viewing experience at all.

1965484,2,B00011V8HM,"Director Siu-Tung Ching is probably better known as action choreographer (of 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggeres') than film director on his own ('Chinese Ghost Stories' series).  He is good at handling martial arts fighting, especially when the fighters are ladies, and I imagine he thought of 'Naked Weapon' as a good chance to show his skills -- no matter what it costs.

DON'T look for any coherent story here.  The film starts with a premise which looks like a rip-off of Japanese film 'Battle Royale.'  Little girls are collected from all over the world, and trained to be invincible warriors, or assassins, under the guidance of ruthless leader 'Madame M.'  Only the fittest can survive, including Charlene (Maggie Q) and Katt (Anya) after the various 'tests' which I am afraid are too unbelievable or downright nasty.  Some may call it 'male fantasy.'  Whatever it is, that's director's vision, which he seems to savor.

The latter half changes its tone, looking more like a rip-off of 'Chalies's Angels' without silly humor.  A CIA agent Daniel Wu (seen in Jackie Chan's 'Around the World in 80 Days') is involved as Charlene's love interest, and things get more violent when Charlene's mother (Cheng Pei Pei, seen in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as Jade Fox) and Japanese mafia (or yakuza, if you like) enter the story.  You see, the plot is so inconsistent.

Let's see the actions of the film, which are not bad, but still OK at best.  Compared with other Hong-Kong action flicks like 'So Close,' they look very inferior with too much use of stunts, or fast-forwards or slow-motions, which are clearly trying to hide the fact that the ladies can pose, but not fight.  If I am not mistaken, the girls in 'So Close' are seen  really kicking and punching.

Instead, you see lots of images of leading ladies in T-shirts or very scanty clothes.  Perhaps boys would enjoy it (and yes, I did, I confess), but contrary to its title, the 'naked' scenes (I mean, nudity) is very brief, so guys, don't expect too much from the film, which is at best 'Half-Naked Weapons.'

If you like to see a Hong-kong actioner featuring the good-looking ladies doing martial arts, see 'So Close.'  If you have seen that, and have some extra time and money, you may try this one ... just don't trust the title, though.",1104019200,4,2308,4.756281407035176

there is two male CIA investigators, thats on a stake out in there private car,
on that day, they had a young apprentice ,  in the car with them, you know
to run  arrons and get then coffee and so on,  a gunfight breaks out with the people
and the two investigators are killed , but the apprentice kills the  people
and goes on to run that part of the investigation  moving forward,
he finds out there has been  40 young girls that has come up missing all over four
countries, italy, the Philippines and Hong kong and japan, he finds through his investigation. this young girls, a bout 7 or 8
are being kidnapped by a  women that calls herself madam x, , she is a female assassin, she takes this young irks to a private island
where she trains them from sun up till sun down to be trained killers, the ones that  can't handle it or don't  to be there
are free to go, but , they could be shot and killed and a few of the women do and they are found on the beach dead the next day
six years later, the girls are grown up young ladies now, they now know how to fight to save there lives , that could be the difference in staying alive
madam x decides to have a  battle between the ladies and the  one  fight to the death and still alive after  one is left can graduate
and work for her , so the battle begins, lots of women are dead now, but madam x decides to save three ladies!
she does one other thing, while the ladies and madam x are all eating celebrating, she ask them one at a time
what the name of the wine and the where it was made, they all answer and they all figure out they had been drugged
madam x had trained them to do whatever it took to stay alive and they did this again,but in  three different countries
as you will see in this movie , there is a lot of fighting , kung fo, kind of style, madam x, knows everything that happens
with these ladies and at one point one of the ladies breaks her cardinal rule, you don't associate with your parents, no matter what!
this happens and watch how its handled and  how important this is at the end of the movie, remember the young apprenctice at the first
you will be surprised to see how he makes a big difference in these ladies lives,  you shed a tear or two  and be happy of what happens as well
now if you want to see another movie such as this , but with more intense fight scnes and more blood and guts, i suggest watching the movie
