8509977,4,B0074JODWG,"Trippin' is a clever little horror-comedy. It has the setup of 70's and 80's slasher movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th, but the outcome and the tone are much different. Trippin' relies more on character development and humor than on blood and guts, even though there is a little of that thrown around from time to time. Just don't expect this to be an all out gorefest and you should be fine. And for nudity, we have a blonde chick who shows her breasts a couple of times. Trippin' has it's problems, though. For a while there, I was wondering why Trippin' was even marketed as a horror film. But by the third act, I understood why. It just took its time in dishing out the horror elements. Trippin' was released by Camp Motion Pictures, and we need more studios like that. Camp Motion Pictures has released many fun horror movies on DVD in the last few years, such as Splatter Beach, Video Violence 1 & 2, and The Basement. And while Trippin' isn't perfect, when the closing credits started rolling, I said ""this is a cool flick"".",1334620800,,1053,4.518324607329843
