8579934,5,B00CBMC3LE,"I wish this were ""required viewing"" or required reading.  The information is critical, not only in raising young children, but in understanding interpersonal neuro-biology in any of our relationships.  This is very informative, but also very entertaining at times.  I loved the tantrumming son, changing his negative energy into positive by making a music video to present his case or cause.  The problem dissolved and moods improved almost magically.",1457136000,2,451,5.492753623188406

8579940,5,B00CBMC3LE,"First I have to say that it is wonderfully insightful of the realities of being a busy parent that this book has been made into a DVD presentation. Yay! to all parenting material that is made into an accessible DVD format. This ensures the message gets the widest dissemination. This book/DVD is detailed neuroscience explained in a way that every parent can understand. The ideas in this book and DVD help us understand not only how we speak / respond to children but why we need to handle these interactions in a certain way. Daniel and Tina are great presenters with perfect examples to illustrate the point. Daniel's hand representation of the brain and Tina's stories interacting with her son make this material concrete and relevant. This is relevant for all parents / children but even parents struggling with behavioral issues. It helped me understand my children's interpretation of interactions and also my own reactions to situations.
This is now in my top 3 parenting resources.",1368835200,5,990,4.969879518072289
