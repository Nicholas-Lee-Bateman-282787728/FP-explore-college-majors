The music is pleasing, the images are attractive (if you are in the right age group), and it was wonderful to get a 20 minute break to drink a cup of coffee, clean up the room or wash the dishes.  I don't know how well brain development is helped, but everyone in our house couldn't imagine not having those tapes.  They even made long car rides much more tolerable.  I have purchased and given out probably 15 sets of the Left and Right Brain DVD's over the years when friends or coworkers were expecting their first child.  Every single time I get the same response, ""he/she didn't seem interested for a while and then one day the baby couldn't get enough"".",1485907200,,837,4.333333333333333
