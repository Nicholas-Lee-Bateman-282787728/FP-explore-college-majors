It has decent production value and the story is different - something you'd catch at a horror convention.  The best part are the ghosts.  They'll definitely give you a bit of a chill if you watch this one late at night!  After watching this flick, I held a bit of hope for the other two especially with C. Thomas Howell starring in House of Fallen.  It had great potential, but a few of the actors ""skills"" mixed in with choppy narration took this one down from earning a spot in my collection.  Lastly, and definitely least, Red Hook is a true D-grade.  I really do hate to criticize movies because I know a lot of time and effort goes into making them.  Red Hook, however, is a definite skip.  All in all, I'd say:

Forget Me Not = 2.5 Stars (Rent or stream before you buy, but some horror fans might like this one.)
House of Fallen = 2 Stars (Give it a shot if you're bored, have nothing else to watch, or enjoy religious/supernatural horror. Also worth a watch for C. Thomas Howell fans.)
Red Hook = 1 Star (Skip. I struggled to make it through this one.)",1472428800,,1204,4.2368421052631575

8494533,4,B00682LSG4,"I wound up getting this on Amazon before reading the three reviews.  I wound up reading the reviews before it arrived and woundered if I REALLY had wasted my money on this Bargin Buy (It really is a bargin at the price I got it at).  1) The video transfers are pretty darn good.  I have seen better.  And I have seen far worse (with as many movies as I have, I have some that are REALLY BAD transfers!!!!),  So as transfers go they are on the plus side of mediocre.  2) Out of the three movies, Forget Me Not was good, House Of Fallen I could make a case either way, & Red Hook was pretty cheeseball (AnGELa PLEASE!) but watchable.
  I would not mind making a recomendation to someone about seeing any of these particular films, even Red Hook (I don't mind ""Cheese"" in movies Ladies & Gentlemen).  So if you don't mind buying a 3-set of movies on Blu-Ray for a bargin price, that are actually fairly decent (Maybe not A-List but Rank from B to C as far as movies go) than this is actually a good buy.
  And YES I Proudly Recommend getting this!",1392854400,2,1044,4.1959798994974875
8494534,1,B00682LSG4,"Do not waste your time or a cent of your hard earned money on this collection.  Here we have three of the worst, boring, and least entertaining movies I have seen in my life.  Like another Amazon reviewer here I also plan to *try* giving this set away however I have a bad feeling that it will keep coming back to me like a bad penny and will forever hang from my blu ray collections neck like the stinking rotten corpse of an albatross.",1383696000,,437,4.190476190476191
8494535,1,B00682LSG4,"These are a collection of the worst horror films ever. You've heard of ""B"" movies and these are definately a ""C"". I plan to give my copy away. I rate this a 1 star as that is the lowest they have.",1363737600,2,196,3.8048780487804876
8494536,2,B00682LSG4,Nothing to recommend for this purchase ..Bluray transfers are poor but can be expected since the movies are not on separate discs,1362614400,,129,4.909090909090909
