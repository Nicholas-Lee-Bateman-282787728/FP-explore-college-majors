1847273,4,B00008H2G4,"Tohru Honda's adventures with Shigure, Kyou(my name too), Yuki and the rest of the Sohma family are very emotional. As you get to meet each member of the Sohma family, you begin to see that the curse goes deeper than just becoming an animal when hugged. they each have their own personal problems that they have to deal with and Tohru pretty much mends all their hearts, or tries at least. For the female veiwers, in addition to crying, you will also be laughing I promise. Yuki and Kyou's ongoing feud supplies me with my daily comedic relief. As you watch more and more of Fruits realize that its not all about romance, but is about love.",1072742400,,640,4.478632478632479
1847274,5,B00008H2G4,"First of all, I wanted to tell you, the readers, that this DVD is amazing. This is the best DVD you've ever watch before. If you haven't seen it, then you just want to buy it. The animation is great, and i don't know what is the best word to describe this DVD- Fruits Basket. To tell the truth, I'm like the maniac of ""Fruits Basket"". I watch it once a week, and I've never bored of it. This is a very, very great manga. I bet you really want to find out what kind of anime is this. It's absolutely good, to be sure.",1071878400,,516,3.9238095238095236
1847275,5,B00008H2G4,I myself have all of the fruits basket dvd's and I think that they  are the best.  The animation of the dvd is great and I reccomend this to all people who enjoy anime.  The story is intresting and all of the characters are so cute especially in their zodiac form!!!! I enjoyed it sooo much and I know you will too.,1061769600,3,315,4.048387096774194
1847276,5,B00008H2G4,"If you can get past the weird name of this series (refers to a Japanese kid's game similar to duck-duck-goose) and the girly-girly packaging, it's a surprisingly deep and poignant character study.
The premise: an orphaned & homeless high-school girl is taken in as a housekeeper by one of her classmates, a very shy but very popular boy named Yuki. He's living with his novelist-cousin Shigure in a rather isolated house in the woods, having run away from the main Sohma compound. But the guys have a big secret--they're shapeshifters, two members of a cursed family.
Our heroine soon makes a place in their hearts with her relentless optimism and unconditional love & gratitude, and soon other disaffected members of the cursed family start to gather at Shigure's house. Chief among the arrivals is a violent-tempered but good-hearted young man known as Kyo, who bears the most difficult curse of all, and who's an outcast even within the Sohma family.
The head of the family, cursed himself, is intensely and malevolently possessive of ""his"" family, and he starts to plot his revenge...but at the same time, he hopes Tohru can save the family from the worst effects of the curse.
Very interesting mixture of genuine pathos and wild slapstick, and a great job portraying the gradual change in characters of not only the two boys, Yuki and Kyo, over a period of 18 months, but also the maturation of the heroine, as she develops  courage and strength to match her innate compassion. She goes from being essentially a sweetly-smiling doormat to someone brave enough to stand up for herself and the people she loves--without getting mean about it.
I have to admit I started watching this series with some skepticism, thinking it'd be hopelessly silly, but ended up loving it. A definite keeper!",1057795200,13,1792,4.914191419141914
1847277,5,B00008H2G4,"If you have made it so far into looking at the various Furuba titles, then I needn't go into the technical aspects of the discs...nor do I need to go on about the first three...
It has been stated, by some, that this DVD ( the 4th in the series) is to be the final installment...however, I believe this to be incongrous with the story progression. While this disc, like the first three, has a wonderful storyline, outrageous humor, and heart-rending drama, it does not end with a note of finality. I think that we, the Fruits Basket viewers, can expect more of the ever developing story of Tohru, and the Sohma clan. At least, I do sorely hope so, since I would dearly love to see the series continue...",1054684800,4,703,4.415384615384616

1847280,5,B00008H2G4,I don't know why this and Ouran host club another of my favorites haven't gotten a second season. While I love the Chinese zodiac curse and all of the characters there was so much more left to explore and so many unresolved plot lines. However I'm not a real manga reader I just like watching the anime but this show left me wanting more and now I have to read the manga. I usually hate goody two shoes girls but the main character is so genuine and sincere I loved her. The other characters were really great too and I wanted to get to know more about them and wanted happy endings for all of them.

1847288,5,B00008H2G4,"I ordered this set for my teen daughter for Christmas.  It was so great to hear the episodes playing as my two daughters binge watched it. The voice actors are excellent and the story line is one of the best in anime. My daughter would watch these when she was middle school aged and we still make references to all of the characters. If you like Angel Beats, Clannad, Ouran High School Host Club, than this is a series for you. The story line of the male characters actually being Chinese zodiac animals and the Motherless girl that befriends them is unique and moving. We all love the music too.  Please see my photos for an example. Thanks!",1483920000,4,643,4.440677966101695

1847294,5,B00008H2G4,"The voice actors and story are great and delves into many character's conflicts showing love and consideration can heal issues.  Despite its mostly PG content there's plenty of character development and issues to entertain everyone.  I bought this used and there are a few minor scratches on the disks but nothing interfering with play.

UPDATE: I spoke too soon: V3 was the only one I hadn't yet seen; so I based my review on just it:
  V1-played this twice, 2nd time language got stuck on Japanese only, found a micro-crack which apparently interfered with language selection.
  V2-had issues with ""RESUME"" on my portable player as did V4.
  V3-only appears fully ok
  V4-had a long circular scratch in the middle about halfway  around the disk, had issues playing the 2nd time also.
All 4 disks are non-standard sized at about 7G.

The series is good for the whole family, well worth the small price.",1480636800,2,903,4.823529411764706

Every time I watch it, the jokes never get old, I learn something new, or I fall in love more and more with it. Not so fond of the profanity, however it could be worse (like other Animes). As a more conservative, I wouldn't recommend it to children under 10, simply because of the transforming back to human without clothing. It does not show below the back- however it is implied. Because of its Slice-of-Life genre, it can relate to many people on different levels too.",1478217600,,540,4.4646464646464645

1847317,3,B00008H2G4,"Spoiler alert!

Tohru Honda, a girl on her own, ends up living with the Sohma family, whose members turn into animals from the Chinese zodiac when weak or hugged by a member of the opposite sex. She has to learn how to deal with the various members of the family, who range from the suspicious Kyo to the goofy Shigure, and everyone in between, all while keeping her sunny nature. Sounds like a fun romp, right? Well, yes...and no. There is a fair bit of slapstick comedy involved, which is great, but a lot of dysfunctional family dynamics, which is not so great. I felt like the story seesawed between fun antics and very dark plot points. The mysterious Akito rules the family, and not kindly; this sets up most of the darkness as Akito uses and abuses family members for no apparent reason other than that he can. It's jarring to go from Tohru's kindly nature to Akito's hatred and abuse, and that didn't work too well for the overall story. What there was of it. I was also confused by the introduction of new characters in several episodes near the end of the anime, who didn't seem to have anything to do with furthering what plot there was. I learned later that this anime actually runs through only the first six books of the manga, which may help explain why the story arc was so disjointed (many things happen later in the manga that refer back to the early books). I did like the English cast, but the fact that there were interjections written in Japanese which were not translated made watching it hard to follow.

Overall, I was disappointed in this series.",1459296000,3,1572,4.512280701754386

1847341,5,B00008H2G4,"That's what Tohru Honda has to deal with in ""Fruits Basket,"" the adaptation of Natsuki Takaya's hit manga. And the manga adaptation is a delightful one -- while the ending gets changed, it's still charming, quirky, slapsticky and sprinkled with darker moments.

Tohru is living in the woods, with only her late mother's photo for company. Exploring one day, she wanders down to a large house, and bumps into the owners: flirtatious Shigure Sohma, and his gorgeous cousin Yuki -- the school's mysterious ""Prince."" After Tohru becomes ill and her tent is destroyed, Yuki and Shigure take her into their home as their new housekeeper... especially since the place is a pigsty.

But Yuki and Shigure are keeping some strange secrets. When Kyo Sohma bursts in to fight Yuki, Tohru tries to stop him -- and the three turn into a dog, cat, and rat. Turns out the Sohma family is cursed with the spirits of the Chinese zodiac, and become those animals whenever they're hugged by a member of the opposite sex. Surprisingly, the mysterious family head Akito allows Tohru to stay with Yuki and Shigure, as long as the volatile Kyo also stays.

And soon Tohru becomes even more wrapped up in the Sohma family, and befriends many members of the zodiac. She, Yuki and Kyo must deal with crazed fanclubs, flamboyant brothers, school festivals, New Year's loneliness, Valentine's day woes, trips to the hot springs, visits to Tohru's mother's grave, and Yuki's band of loyal stalkers.

But Tohru also learns more about the curse -- the traumatic pasts that Momiji, Yuki and Kyo keep hidden, the little ""tiger"" girl who is bullied into silence, and Hatori's tragic romance. And finally Tohru discovers the horrific secret that Kyo is hiding, and the true role of the angry, violent Akito...

It takes a little while for ""Fruits Basket"" to get going, but after a few episodes it finds its footing and charges ahead like Kagura. Just don't expect it to really have an ending -- it doesn't end so much as stop, on a particularly moving story about Kyo and Tohru.

There's lots of romantic tension, slapstick fight scenes (usually involving Kyo and somebody else), quirky comedy (Ayame's kooky cosplay shop), and amusingly tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house!"").

But while the anime is somewhat more lighthearted than the manga, there's also a melancholy side to the story, centering on a curse that is ruining its victims' lives. In the midst of the comedy, we get glimpses of Tohru's tragic past, the families torn apart by the curse, and the Sohmas' isolation from the rest of the world.

Tohru herself is the most lovable character of the bunch -- she has a lot of sorrow over her mother's death and the unkindness of some of her relatives, but she compensates with optimism and friendliness. She borders on Pollyannishness occasionally, but is balanced out somewhat by her oddball friends.

And the Sohmas rule as far as quirkiness is concerned -- there's the quiet ""Prince"" Yuki, the volatile loner Kyo, and the charmingly kooky Shigure. The rest of the family is even more eccentric -- the flamboyant, charming Ayame, Yuki's prodigal brother who is trying ineptly to mend fences. Not to mention the volcanic Haru, the tragic Hatori, and half-German, deceptively cheerful Momiji.

""Fruits Basket"" is by turns hilarious and bittersweet, with plenty of wacky antics, sad backstories and quirky characters. Delightful from beginning to end.",1442102400,5,3488,4.957191780821918

1847362,5,B00008H2G4,"Classic! the first word that comes to mind. Here is my review for Fruits Basket.

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Tohru Honda a high schooler freshman mother just died, So she is living in the woods when she is discovered by a near by family who goes to the same school as her. So she is taken in by the family called Sohmas. When during one moment she finds out their long dark family secret. When the Sohmas's are stressed out or hugged by the oppsit sex outside of the family they turn into animals! Animals from the chinese zodiac! So then on are the adventures of Tohru Honda and dealing with the secret of the Sohma Family.

Pros: this is most of the time a light hearted series about a girl who has a super big heart of gold but sometimes is a total air head. She shows that its never wrong to be too nice to anyone. Always having a smile on your face can brighten up anyones day. This contains all 26 episodes uncut. I love this anime alot! its very good for anyone of all ages to enjoy!

Cons: the only con I have with this series is the ending, without spoiling it I feel like it just ended without it really being cleared up, they just left it as (for example) ""well I tried, lets go home and enjoys eachothers company""

Over all: This should be in every anime collectors series! This is also a great starter for anyone who never saw anime at all! with its good story line, character development and sometimes action scenes its good! BUY THIS SERIES!!!",1428796800,3,1474,4.310469314079422

1847368,5,B00008H2G4,"I bought it for me after I read the story. My grandchildren started to watch this and they loved it.  So far my granddaughter have watched it 2 times.

1847370,3,B00008H2G4,"This anime is based on the first six volumes of the manga of the same name. Tohru Honda moves in with some members of the Sohma clan, who, she finds out, are cursed to turn into animals of the Chinese zodiac when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex. She accepts this and becomes just about the only person outside the family who knows about the curse. As the anime goes on, we meet more and more of these characters.

And that is one of the problems with the way the story line unfolds. We keep meeting new characters right up till the next-to-last episode, but there doesn't seem to be any reason for bringing them in so late in the series. It's baffling why the writers of the anime just seem to follow the manga blindly (the manga has 23 volumes, so many of the characters who come in later actually have a reason for doing so, as they become involved in the story later on). It also brings in some of the darker elements of the manga, again with no explanation. It's frustrating to understand Akito's actions, for example, unless you have read the manga.

This anime is (mostly) fun to watch if you don't get hung up on all these plot points, and as such is probably better to watch if you have not read the manga yet. I also was frustrated with the scene change screens, which are written of course in Japanese kanji, no translation or subtitles. I would have really liked to know what they said.

In all, my rating is just OK. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say it was a must-see.",1424822400,2,1496,4.279151943462898

1847405,5,B00008H2G4,"This is a high-quality rendering of the FB series. You get the usual ""must watch ads"" whenever you insert the DVD--unless you watch it on your computer, and your computer remembers where you left off (mine did--and I was just using Windows Media player). 4 DVDs, nice little package. The extras were a bit weak, but whatever. I bought this for Fruits Basket.

The series is a ""faithful(?)"" rendition of the classic Manga. Several key points were left out, so about halfway through the series it goes from ""Hello Kitty cute"" to depressing, confusing, and finally a head scratcher. Absolutely a ""must see"" if you like anime or have read the books. The voicing is perfect, the colors and the animation are expertly crafted. A bit of Chibi finds its way into the overall anime style, but that is to be expected. My biggest complaint is that they did not make more episodes, but that is a complaint to the animation studio that has almost nothing to do with the DVD. For whatever reason, they just chopped up the series. But this is the anime we have, and it will probably be the only Fruits Basket that will ever be made. For all of its tiny flaws, this is a unique and fun classic. It is a weird blend of ""family friendly"" and ""questionable material"" (a lot of inferences) that make you wonder what is going on behind the scenes. Parents should watch it before allowing their children to see the entire series unattended.",1404172800,26,1418,4.582677165354331

1847425,5,B00008H2G4,"Imagine if you moved in with a new family and friends... and found out they turn into animals when you hug them.

That's what Tohru Honda has to deal with in ""Fruits Basket,"" the adaptation of Natsuki Takaya's hit manga. And the manga adaptation is a delightful one -- while the ending gets changed, it's still charming, quirky, slapsticky and sprinkled with darker moments.

Tohru is living in the woods, with only her late mother's photo for company. Exploring one day, she wanders down to a large house, and bumps into the owners: flirtatious Shigure Sohma, and his gorgeous cousin Yuki -- the school's mysterious ""Prince."" After Tohru becomes ill and her tent is destroyed, Yuki and Shigure take her into their home as their new housekeeper... especially since the place is a pigsty.

But Yuki and Shigure are keeping some strange secrets. When Kyo Sohma bursts in to fight Yuki, Tohru tries to stop him -- and the three turn into a dog, cat, and rat. Turns out the Sohma family is cursed with the spirits of the Chinese zodiac, and become those animals whenever they're hugged by a member of the opposite sex. Surprisingly, the mysterious family head Akito allows Tohru to stay with Yuki and Shigure, as long as the volatile Kyo also stays.

And soon Tohru becomes even more wrapped up in the Sohma family, and befriends many members of the zodiac. She, Yuki and Kyo must deal with crazed fanclubs, flamboyant brothers, school festivals, New Year's loneliness, Valentine's day woes, trips to the hot springs, visits to Tohru's mother's grave, and Yuki's band of loyal stalkers.

But Tohru also learns more about the curse -- the traumatic pasts that Momiji, Yuki and Kyo keep hidden, the little ""tiger"" girl who is bullied into silence, and Hatori's tragic romance. And finally Tohru discovers the horrific secret that Kyo is hiding, and the true role of the angry, violent Akito...

It takes a little while for ""Fruits Basket"" to get going, but after a few episodes it finds its footing and charges ahead like Kagura. Just don't expect it to really have an ending -- it doesn't end so much as stop, on a particularly moving story about Kyo and Tohru.

There's lots of romantic tension, slapstick fight scenes (usually involving Kyo and somebody else), quirky comedy (Ayame's kooky cosplay shop), and amusingly tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house!"").

But while the anime is somewhat more lighthearted than the manga, there's also a melancholy side to the story, centering on a curse that is ruining its victims' lives. In the midst of the comedy, we get glimpses of Tohru's tragic past, the families torn apart by the curse, and the Sohmas' isolation from the rest of the world.

Tohru herself is the most lovable character of the bunch -- she has a lot of sorrow over her mother's death and the unkindness of some of her relatives, but she compensates with optimism and friendliness. She borders on Pollyannishness occasionally, but is balanced out somewhat by her oddball friends.

And the Sohmas rule as far as quirkiness is concerned -- there's the quiet ""Prince"" Yuki, the volatile loner Kyo, and the charmingly kooky Shigure. The rest of the family is even more eccentric -- the flamboyant, charming Ayame, Yuki's prodigal brother who is trying ineptly to mend fences. Not to mention the volcanic Haru, the tragic Hatori, and half-German, deceptively cheerful Momiji.

""Fruits Basket"" is by turns hilarious and bittersweet, with plenty of wacky antics, sad backstories and quirky characters. Delightful from beginning to end.",1387929600,15,3602,4.927392739273928

1847450,5,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket is by many considered a classic and i have to agree with that completely. It's the story of a young orphan who moves in with members of a cursed family and changes things up for them. The actual plot i don't think i have to explain because so many people have in their reviews. So i'll just give my opinion: Almost every episode was great you laughed you cried and fell in love with the characters. There were two or three episodes i didn't care for but  that is usually with every anime. I think this is such a great anime and would classify it as a personalfavorite. Some advice though: go read the manga! the manga completely finishes off the story unlike the anime which while it has a emotional ending it doesn't resolve many issues between characters.
So in conclusion:
Pro's:
Amazing,human characters.
Very emotional, inspiring moments.
Comedy that feels genuine and unforced (most of the time)
A exceptional soundtrack  that brings a tear to the eye.

Cons:
Ending feels anti climatic and abrupt.
One or two episodes that felt unneeded and filler like (prince Yuki fan club episodes anyone?)",1376352000,,1113,4.72680412371134

1847473,5,B00008H2G4,"This is such a sweet, heartfelt, romantic, and funny anime. The characters are quite unique. It's so good, I couldn't get enough of this show. I laughed out loud and even cried.

This anime is about a positive, hard-working teenage girl, Tohru, that loses her mother in an accident. She ends up living in a tent in the woods and happens to stumble across a few members of the Sohma family. She is invited to live with them as a housekeeper, but accidentally finds out the huge Sohma family secret. Thirteen members of the family are cursed. If anyone of the opposite sex embraces them they turn into one of the zodiac animals or the cat that was left out of the zodiac. The cat is treated like a monster and outcast by everyone, including the other zodiac members. Tohru is a normal girl, but is able to heal each of the Sohma families fragile hearts and tragic pasts, and even tries to find a way to break the curse that has plagued the family for generations.

I wish that they had told the whole story in this anime and added all the characters that were in the manga, but it's still a very entertaining show. I highly suggest reading the manga. There is 23 volumes. The manga is even better than the anime.",1373155200,,1210,4.397321428571429

On another note, for people who don't have the funds and are debating between the expensive Collector's Edition and the more affordable Viridian Collection; well I bought the Viridian Collection, because I couldn't afford the Collector's. It really is a box with two slim cases and 4 discs, but its as pretty as the Collector's. And it also include extras, for those who thought just because it was a Viridian Collection it didn't include them. I must say I really like the Viridian Collection more. It's smaller (as thin as a regular DVD case) the inserts are really pretty, has all the episodes and the extras.

Tohru does not get into a relationship with anyone in the anime, if you ant to know who Tohru chooses to be with then I recommend you read the manga. Also, Akito is a woman in the manga, but in the anime Akito is a boy.",1364947200,,478,4.546511627906977

I would classify this anime as a more Fantasy/Fiction than more of a romance. The plot is of a ordinary but yet not ordinary girl that is humble and what we all could agree on very selfless, more or less kind of a push-over. She didn't really know who the Sohma family were beyond the fact Yuki was in her class. So she met the Older fellow one morning by the name of Shigure and found out the place the Sohma family were living and the tent she lived in due to circumstances was on their property. After they figured out the situation they let her stay there as their Maid/Cook. To learn their magical secret was a rare sight, but Tohru found it out by accident. So from after that day she got to find out more and more about their family secret and the twists and turns of knowing about it. Will she fit in? (you will have to watch it to find out or maybe even buy it).

When they touch a member of the opposite sex they turn into a different animal in the Chinese Zodiac. The story follows Tohru and her life with this weird family.

I had a great time watching this anime and I think it's fantastic. That being said; it lacked something that could have made it a lot better. Emotion. There were some touching moments. Like the story of the family's doctor, and the ending where Kyo turns into his true form. If the relationships between the characters were developed a little more, instead of everyone being so stand offish the whole time those moments could have been more memorable. I'm not bashing this series at all. I actually really like it. My point is that it had way more potential than was actually achieved.

The animation in Fruits Basket is high quality. The soundtrack and voice acting are also very good. The anime was produced masterfully.

I'm sure everyone has felt different, or has gone through a lot of problems in their life. I suppose I related to Tohru, because I too, had suddenly lost a family member, and I knew how tough it could be to go through. I admired her perseverance, and sweetness. Nothing seemed to bring her down. I related to Yuki, because I was generally shy in school, and wasn't close to anyone. Yuki's fights with Kyo were just comedic. There was an episode about Momiji that made me break out in tears, as it was so emotional.

I would recommend this dvd set to anyone who enjoyed the show. It follows the manga closely, from what I've read, with a few changes to make it work better as a tv show.",1351641600,,820,4.222929936305732

Now...... On to the packaging-- The box it comes in is a chipboard box and this is what FUNi (Funimation) Usually uses for their (Limited Editions) only, which is why I was SHOCKED when I opened it-WHICH IS A GOOD THING! The artwork is all over the box and will make a really nice addition to anyone's anime or dvd collection. It's also LOADED with bonus features which actually has a seperate disk all to itself-which is pretty nice too. All in all i RE-bought this because my single dvd sets were scratched and didn't play properly and second......I just fell in love with this Collector's Edition Box so yeah...If you truly enjoy this series, I hope you will buy it.

Now if you have rea the manga you prob will be disappointed bc there's only one season and it let's off like on the 6 manga. If you don't know what fruits basket is about it's about the sohma family who live with a curse when they get hugged by the opposite sex they turn into one of the zodak signs. A romance kinda stars between tohru and kyo and yuki. Pulling the love triangle but it's actually sweet tohru contacts with everyone in the sohma family.

I don't know what's up with that, but it seems the others who bought it had no problems.

I definitely love the detail, as well as the extras. This does follow a different storyline from the manga though, and there are certain details that are incorrect when compared to the manga. For this set itself, and for a show you can watch together with family members and younger siblings, I feel that this is a good buy. I will point out that amazon has periodic sales on anime, and I only paid $30, and I would not pay $60 for this product. Personally I feel that's too steep of a price for a show with one season, and I tend to try and get deals on anime since I buy so much of it. All of the dvds in the set came intact and were still in place when the set was opened. For the price I paid the packaging is high quality, with individual dvd sets housed within the larger box sleeve. Each set has artwork on it, which my friend seemed to enjoy just looking at. And unlike some past collections, this also has some special features on it as well. Definitely worth the price, and if the price goes back up, I think it's worth waiting for the price to fall again, rather then buying the viridian collection (worse packaging, less features, not remastered).",1326326400,3,1571,4.275167785234899
1847569,4,B00008H2G4,"This occurs a lot but I love the manga and I love the anime to. The main problem is compared to the manga the anime rushes some things and ends at the end of vol 6 or 7 in the manga.

The story is about a girl, Tohru Honda who ends up living with 3 guys because her grandpa is busy doing renovations and both her parents have passed away. Well the catch is when these boys get hugged by a girl they transform into one of the members of the chinese zodiac (watch the anime and it will go into more detail).

In the manga though you meet all the zodiac members and in the anime you only meet a handful which is depressing in my opinion.

Overall though the anime is great. I've heard some people dis the english dub but I personally enjoyed it. It is definitely an anime worth watching with some great lessons to be learned by it as well.",1324857600,,836,4.054545454545455

I got this in the mail just yesterday, and it's amazing! It comes in a cardboard-like box (very sturdy!), with art on the front and back, so however you want to display it is acceptable. The side-out DVD covers have art on the front and back as well. Also, the DVDs themselves have shiny art on them that have pictures of the chibi animal-versions of the characters.

It's really amazing the price I got this for, too, as well! Cheaper than the Viridian collection!

The extras our on their own fifth disk, and I haven't really had time to go though the all, and that should say a lot! There's a lot of little extras!

1847587,5,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket has captured my heart! With lovable characters, a ""What's going to happen next?!"" type of storyline, Fruits Basket had me addicted from the beginning! I read the manga first, and I'm glad I did. The anime does make a couple of plot changes, but it's no big deal.

This anime is also hilarious. At some points it had my rolling on the floor laughing. Characters like Kyo, Ayame, Ritsu, Haru and Kagura always make me laugh. It also has it's serious moments too. Each character has a story to tell, and some of them are heart breaking. It leaves you feeling bad for the characters, and hoping that somehow they will end up being ok. I even felt bad for the seemingly evil character, Akito.

The only main problem with this anime is one thing: it's only 26 episodes long. Which means it leaves out about half the manga series. I believe the anime leaves off around volume 11, and the series is 23 volumes long. And there is almost no hope for a second season, it's been about a decade. Which is just too bad, I would love to see the ending especially with the plot changes in the anime.

Regardless, this anime is great even though it's short. I would recommend it.",1314835200,,1176,4.435185185185185

1847604,4,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket is one of my favorite anime series, rivaled only by Full Metal Alchemist and Trigun - though it shares little in common with those titles aside from quality. While Fruits Basket is technically  Shojo, as President of my University's Anime Club I can provide testament to it's broad appeal even to Shonen fans. It offers a wonderful mix of comedy, drama, and even action.

I could ramble on about it's merits but I'm guessing that, like me, what you really want to know is how this Collector's Edition ranks against earlier releases of Fruits Basket. The answer, in my opinion, is that this Collector's Edition is surprisingly better save for one annoyance.

o--Presentation--o
In my opinion, the box art and DVD menus are far superior to previous releases of Fruits Basket. There's a lot more original artwork here, particularly decorating the interior of the cases, and it's clear that a lot of effort was put into making this Collector's Edition stand out aesthetically.

o--Content--o
The core footage has been remastered and unless I'm mistaken some additional subtitles have been tossed in to explain Japanese text, but honestly I didn't notice many differences between this release and previous releases. Where this release really shines is the additional content, which is why it's more geared towards ""hardcore"" fans rather than casual fans. To break it down by content...

o-Episode 26 Video Commentary: Found on Disc 4, the English Voice Actors for Yuki, Tohru, Kyo, and Shigure provide commentary on Episode 26 of Fruits Basket. This was recorded nine years after the English dub was finished and it's very American - reminds me of a morning radio show, none of them quite know what the say at first but eventually it gets more interesting. Overall though, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.

o-Trailers: Disc 4 comes with trailers for a lot of other Funimation anime. At least these trailers are optional...though the only one that really caught my eye was Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

o-Textless Opening & Closing Songs: Not much to say on this, it's the opening and closing without text. Vocals are available in both English and Japanese.

o-Fruits Basket Rooms 1-3 (Japanese with subtitles): The Japanese Voice Actor for Tohru interviews the Japanese Voice Actors for Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure. I always enjoy the surprise of seeing what Voice Actors really look like and the interviews were fun but interesting. I thought this feature was the highlight of the additional content and I wish that the English cast had done something similar.

o-Behind the Scenes Featurette (Japanese with subtitles): This featurette is scattered but has some interesting information. Honestly, I found it rather boring and didn't finish watching it. I may go back but I already knew a lot of what it was sharing - a danger of being too much of an Otaku, I suppose.

o-Akitaroh Dachi Interview (Japanese with subtitles): This interview with the director of Fruits Basket took place before the American release of the series and I thought it was fairly interesting - though, not really a highlight of the disc. There are some interesting points, like the question of a second season of the anime since the manga was still being released at the time.

o-Eyecatch Galleries (Japanese with subtitles): This is a slideshow of the ""ka-ching"" wipes used throughout the series, narrated by the Japanese voice actor for Tohru. I thought it was pretty interesting but then the ""ka-ching"" wipes always catch my eye while watching the series and it was nice to watch them more slowly with some explanation of the details involved. For instance, who that giraffe represents.

o-English Cast Interview: This mass interview is interesting and fun, but a little overwhelming, it might have been more in-depth one on one. I also wish that it had video - I really enjoy the surprise of seeing what Voice Actors look like.

o-Illustration Gallery (Japanese with subtitles): A small selection of Fruits Basket pictures in slideshow format.

o-Outtakes: This is a short series of outtakes from the English dub, it doesn't last very long and it seemed to focus on the early series. There's no video to go along with it and it all gets a little jumbled together, which cuts back on it's humor in my opinion...but it's still amusing.

o-Outtakes, English Closing Theme & English Auditions: These were fun but again, like the Outtakes, there's no video and it's all jumbled together. There's not a lot of content and the English Closing Theme is woven throughout.

o--Annoyance--o
My only complaint with the Collector's Edition is that Funimation decided to include unskipable commercials at the beginning of discs 2, 3, and 4. I know this is just an inconvenience but it still really pisses me off - if the commercials were skipable this would be a minor complaint, probably not even worth mentioning, but the fact that Funimation forces customers who purchased their product to watch commercials before viewing said product really annoys me. I'm planning to send an irate letter their way.

o--Bottom-Line--o
If you're a casual watcher this Collector's Edition doesn't offer that different of a viewing experience aside from the remastered footage - so go with what's cheapest. If you are a Fruits Basket fan, than this is the definitive edition packed with tons of extra content to help you get your Otaku on. I would rate the Collector's Edition Five Stars if not for the unskipable commercials at the start of discs 2, 3, and 4.",1311638400,63,5532,4.976164680390032
1847605,5,B00008H2G4,"I love anime and have watched anything I can get my hands on from Pokemon and Shugo Chara to Black Butler and Vampire Knight. Fruits Basket is my favorite anime and manga series.
  It's not as cutesie as you may think. There are some seriously funny moments and some times you want to cry but it has this darker undercurrent that keeps it from being annoyingly cute.
  Tohru is a 16 year old orphan taken in by the Sohma family. She manages to turn all their wolds upside down. She is loyal and her personality draws the best out of the people around her. The curse of the Sohma family is that 13 of them are possessed by the vengeful spirits of the Zodiac (Rat, Ox, Rabbit, Boar, Snake, Dog, Dragon, Ram, Tiger, Cock, Horse, Monkey and Cat) although the Horse and Cock don't appear in the anime. When hugged by a member of the opposite sex they transform into their zodiac form only to change back naked. It makes for many laugh out loud moments. It doesn't show nudity. all the characters are likeable and have their funny and serious moments.
  This is a wonderful Dub. I have seen the subbed and dubbed versions and I don't think anything was lost in translation. I think the dub is actually better then the subbed version which is really rare.
I strongly recommend you read the mangas also, the anime covers only 8 out of 23 mangas.",1309996800,,1337,4.414634146341464
1847606,5,B00008H2G4,"This is the first anime I have ever gone so far as to purchase rather than watch free somewhere.  I was introduced to it by my step-daughter and fell in love.  This year, I asked for it for my birthday, after watching it several times on Hulu.  My only complaint is I wish it lasted longer - I'd like to see the kids grow up.  This is a sweet, feel good anime for anyone who ever felt like the odd kid out that no one liked or who has something about them they think is so weird everyone will hate them for it.  It is full of positive messages.  I can see some American families having issues with explaining to their kids how it is that several members of the Sohma family dress and even live as members of the opposite sex.  There are some little innuendos about the relationship between Shigure and Ayame that might be disturbing to some.  Other families who are not threatened by different sexualities might find these to be positive images and messages as well.  Some commentators mention that there isn't a good parent in the bunch - but it is clear to me that Tohru's mother was a great parent (even though she is not conventional - again, this isn't a bad thing), and I'm sorry but out here in the real world there are lots of bad parents and lots of kids trying to deal with that.  Having been there, I can tell you it is reassuring to know there are other people out there who have that problem.  It is too easy to think you have the only rotten parents in the world, everyone else is Ozzy and Harriet, and then to blame yourself, as children often do, for the flaws of their parents.  I also like that Shigure, although he is not a parent, and Kyo's mentor, take the place of the rotten parents - there are other people willing to mentor and love you even if your parents are not the best.  That's something I learned as I went along in life.  Would have been nice to have something like Fruits Basket to watch and fill me with hope until I found them.

In conclusion, I find nothing but good and positive messages of hope, redemption, acceptance, and love in this anime.  Tohru even offers love and acceptance to Akito, who has offered her nothing but violence, threats and hatred.  If you find anything negative here - you must have brought it in yourself.",1309737600,,2269,4.313679245283019

Don't forget that.

The animation is very well done, and the English voices do not detract from the original. I would recommend Fruits Basket to anyone interested in form shifting. I need to actually buy this for myself...",1305849600,3,609,4.536363636363636
1847609,5,B00008H2G4,"Imagine if you moved in with a new family and friends... and found out they turn into animals when you hug them.

That's what Tohru Honda has to deal with in ""Fruits Basket,"" the adaptation of Natsuki Takaya's hit manga. And the manga adaptation is a delightful one -- while the ending gets changed, it's still charming, quirky, slapsticky and sprinkled with darker moments.

Tohru is living in the woods, with only her late mother's photo for company. Exploring one day, she wanders down to a large house, and bumps into the owners: flirtatious Shigure Sohma, and his gorgeous cousin Yuki -- the school's mysterious ""Prince."" After Tohru becomes ill and her tent is destroyed, Yuki and Shigure take her into their home as their new housekeeper... especially since the place is a pigsty.

But Yuki and Shigure are keeping some strange secrets. When Kyo Sohma bursts in to fight Yuki, Tohru tries to stop him -- and the three turn into a dog, cat, and rat. Turns out the Sohma family is cursed with the spirits of the Chinese zodiac, and become those animals whenever they're hugged by a member of the opposite sex. Surprisingly, the mysterious family head Akito allows Tohru to stay with Yuki and Shigure, as long as the volatile Kyo also stays.

And soon Tohru becomes even more wrapped up in the Sohma family, and befriends many members of the zodiac. She, Yuki and Kyo must deal with crazed fanclubs, flamboyant brothers, school festivals, New Year's loneliness, Valentine's day woes, trips to the hot springs, visits to Tohru's mother's grave, and Yuki's band of loyal stalkers.

But Tohru also learns more about the curse -- the traumatic pasts that Momiji, Yuki and Kyo keep hidden, the little ""tiger"" girl who is bullied into silence, and Hatori's tragic romance. And finally Tohru discovers the horrific secret that Kyo is hiding, and the true role of the angry, violent Akito...

It takes a little while for ""Fruits Basket"" to get going, but after a few episodes it finds its footing and charges ahead like Kagura. Just don't expect it to really have an ending -- it doesn't end so much as stop, on a particularly moving story about Kyo and Tohru.

There's lots of romantic tension, slapstick fight scenes (usually involving Kyo and somebody else), quirky comedy (Ayame's kooky cosplay shop), and amusingly tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house!"").

But while the anime is somewhat more lighthearted than the manga, there's also a melancholy side to the story, centering on a curse that is ruining its victims' lives. In the midst of the comedy, we get glimpses of Tohru's tragic past, the families torn apart by the curse, and the Sohmas' isolation from the rest of the world.

Tohru herself is the most lovable character of the bunch -- she has a lot of sorrow over her mother's death and the unkindness of some of her relatives, but she compensates with optimism and friendliness. She borders on Pollyannishness occasionally, but is balanced out somewhat by her oddball friends.

And the Sohmas rule as far as quirkiness is concerned -- there's the quiet ""Prince"" Yuki, the volatile loner Kyo, and the charmingly kooky Shigure. The rest of the family is even more eccentric -- the flamboyant, charming Ayame, Yuki's prodigal brother who is trying ineptly to mend fences. Not to mention the volcanic Haru, the tragic Hatori, and half-German, deceptively cheerful Momiji.

""Fruits Basket"" is by turns hilarious and bittersweet, with plenty of wacky antics, sad backstories and quirky characters. Delightful from beginning to end.",1300752000,15,3602,4.927392739273928

I would say this anime attempts to answer the question: How far are you willing to risk for a friend (loved one)? Hmmm, should I rephrase that? ARE YOU WILLING TO RISK EVERYTHING FOR THE ONE YOU LOVE?? This is what Tohru will attempt to answer as she ventures into her relationship with the Sohmas: Yuki, Kyo, and the rest of the family that hide a curse that burdens each of them. Although the anime's story revolves around the trio of Yuki, Kyo, and Tohru, there are side stories for the other members of the Sohmas that are cursed. I loved that they include these characters and how Tohru interacts with each of them and eventually, unexpectedly on her part, she is able to reach into their hearts and assist them in coping with this curse that they bear. Unbeknown to them she becomes their sounding board and their light in their darkness especially to Kyo who bears the darkest secret of all.

1847624,5,B00008H2G4,"I never picked up a Manga or thought of watching an Anime until a friend of mine submitted her glowing review of this series and told me just how good it was. Even then, my reluctance to try something so culturally different from what I'm used to held me back from trying this series. I'm really, really glad I finally took the plunge and decided to watch this show! Initially, the story is a little slow and the characters seem a little cliche', but the further along you go, the deeper you get into their psyche and realize that their is a lot of pain and sadness being held inside which adds so much more to their dynamic and character.

The perfect Yuki character is actually one of the most fascinating the more you learn about him, as are Kyo and many others. I wasn't truly hooked until around episode six or seven, when the series takes a more serious tone and introduces the concept that the curse the Sohmas suffer from may not be as wonderful as Tohru sees it. This episode is very well done and very sad and definitely starts to show the potential of this series. I was sold and couldn't wait to see the next episode!

This series has a lot of heart and soul and will touch you deeply and make you truly care for these characters and desire them to have a happy ending. The finale itself is very surprising and unexpected, and takes a much more dire tone, which only increases the interest and makes you long to know what will happen next! Fortunately, the story is expanded on and continues in the Manga form, and this Anime series is a great way to get introduced to it. The music is cheerful and emotional at different times, the characters varied and intriguing and re-watching is a must, as each episode has questions and builds up to certain reveals without you realizing it until you watch a second time. It's very good, entertaining, humorous and well acted and directed. I highly recommend this anime and the mangas, which are a must to complete this thrilling, emotional and dark tale that manages to charm and amuse you at the same time.",1294531200,,2060,4.461538461538462

1847626,4,B00008H2G4,"On the face of it, I should hate Fruits Basket (FB).

-- An overly nice girl, surrounded by beautiful (and sometimes sexually confused) men.
-- Cute animal transformations.
-- A predictable (in fiction, the maternal instinct activators always win) cliche uncontrollable bad boy (Kyo) + boring but intelligent and princely pretty boy (Yuki) love triangle, with the nice girl at the center.

But I couldn't hate FB. I loved it. When you list the elements that make FB tick, glossing over the positives, then it reads like something aimed squarely at those without penises. However, in reality it's one of the rare 'genderless' shoujo in terms of both genders being able to derive pleasure from watching it.

FB's heroine, Tohru, could very well be described as kind to the point of fakeness, but that's not how she came across to me. She'd been raised with loving care and taught numerous life lessons by her mother, and that enabled her to show a natural, always giving loving side to those around her. The entire cast of characters fall for and/or like her not because she's kind but because there's no hidden agenda behind her actions. And, occasionally, along with being genuinely sweet, she'd come out with an intelligent insight or two, using an analogy - such as the time she told Kyo he was like a rice ball that didn't realize he had a plum stuck to his back in an attempt to get him to understand that he's unable to see his good points.

Tohru's character alone makes what would be an otherwise uninspiring love triangle worth investing in, emotionally. She stands in the middle of two rivals who hate each other with passion, and she unites them through the love they both hold for her. Because of her, friendship may blossom, but it's also true that their feelings for her may very well push their heated rivalry over the edge - that's why it's so compelling to watch how the trio's relationship develops.

Putting Tohru aside, I did start to tire of the episodic silliness, towards the end. The series reached a point, around halfway through, where the love triangle wasn't advancing at all and nothing new regarding the curse was being revealed. Instead, every episode covered a new but largely pointless character, or brought other already introduced characters back into the fray. It was entertaining, most certainly, but it was reaching the point of becoming old and stale.

...And that's why the final three episodes shocked me so much. I expected a rushed 'original story' finale. Instead, the direction of the show changed completely - the comedy being removed - and, out of nowhere, some seriously hard-hitting drama replaced it.

Kyo's past and the dark secret he has to live with transformed him into a character with true depth - no longer was he a mere clone of every other bad-tempered, simple-minded, aggressive third point of a love triangle. His issues with his mother being afraid of him and not being honest are deep-rooted, and his happiness over Tohru admitting to being scared of him spoke volumes about the writing, as well as further highlighting why Tohru is so lovable.

You see, if Tohru truly was 100% perfect and the type of character that can only exist in the imagination of men, she'd have run right after Kyo after seeing the real him and not once hesitated. But she didn't. Instead, she was sick as she pursued and thought about him, and she couldn't help but admit to her fear. Her actions made me view her as a very human character, and Kyo's... problem means the story is probably going to go in an almost Beauty and the Beast direction. My only disappointment right now is that the anime is incomplete, requiring much manga reading for me to see the story through to its conclusion...

In closing, I'm happy I wasn't so foolish as to assume the worst before giving FB my time. Unsurprisingly, considering they share the same director, FB and Kodocha's humour is very similar, and I'm fond of stories that keep me laughing, even when dealing with difficult subjects that would weigh down other stories in doom and gloom.

If, like me, you have too many chest hairs to count, fret not: FB will not turn you gay. Every girly-seeming anime box set needs a 'SAFE FOR MANLY MEN!' sticker stuck on, and FB is the first I'd attach such a sticker to.",1291939200,3,4290,4.723262032085562
1847627,5,B00008H2G4,The product itself was in excellent shape and arrived quickly.  The Fruits Basket series is adorable and exciting.  I would definitely recommend this to any anime lover.,1289347200,,169,5.222222222222222
1847628,3,B00008H2G4,"I was attracted to this show when i read in the synopsis that the story started off with the main character moving from a tent into the house of a family that turn into animals when hugged by members of the opposite sex.  It showed up on a free movie player so i started it and was compelled to continue to watch.  The characters all have really strong personalities that draws one in, and the humor directed towards adults made me giggle and laugh out loud; but then the redundancies began to pile up.  Toru's incessant selflessness began to get on my nerves, and then the 3 minute monologues of love and caring started showing up.

""i failed a test and now i'm sick, i let you all down"" *crying (actual quote)

awww Toru... now feel better so you can do our laundry, cook and clean for us BEFORE you go to school and your job.  No seriously she does all those things and still is completely selfless and concerned about everyone else being pleased.  I'm no feminist and i start to feel like some chauvinist dreamed this show up to train girls how to be the perfect wife/slave.

Oh and the little tranny boy Momiji's fake crying makes me want to kill myself.",1288224000,,1159,4.383177570093458
1847629,2,B00008H2G4,"I first noticed Fruits Basket was when I was browsing through the Amazon product selection and this anime's unusual high rating caught my attentions immediately. So I quickly watched a few episodes (1- 10) online and I was totally hooked by it. Then I stopped and hit the purchase button right away to order a copy without finishing the rest of the episodes. When it arrived, I quickly put it on my DVD player to finish the rest of the show, but it turned out, as you can tell from my rating, it left me totally disapponted.

To be fair, this anime is without a doubt one of the sweestest and most touching anime I've ever seen in a long time.  As the title suggests, the main character, Tohru is described as a basket, and the fruits represent the variable characters with the curse of Chinese Zodiac animals, but Tohru holds them or unifies them together like a fruits basket despite of their inner differences. Therefore, the message behind this anime is very positive. It's about being youself, to learn to accept each other's uniqueness and differences. At least that's how I see it. Although the show has such a sweet and warm concept, there are a number of undeniable existant flaws that unexpectedly ruin its potential. Among all the flaws, perhaps the lack of character's diversifications bother me the most.

1) I can forget about the main character, Tohru's ultimate selfless, simple-minded and sacrifiable personalities, which comes off as unrealistic and annoying at times, however, it's totally irritated that certain characteristic traits of many characters are overused which comes off as less diversed and less creactive. Momiji (the rabbit), Ayame (the snake) and Ritsu (the monkey) are all described as a gayish gender-confused cross-dresser, which is totally repetitive and ridiculous. Even Yuki (the rat) appears to be very feminine. I don't understand why the creator didn't choose to follow their real personality traits in accordance with the original descriptions of the Chinese zodiac since that would make much more sense. Ritsu and Ayame perhaps deserved to be called the ""poison"" of the show. Not only they both are cross-dresser, but also their other personality traits are equally unbearable. Ayame is narcissistic and not one bit funny and the monkey Ritsu who is described as so extremely depressed and low self-esteem that you would almost wish the character to be killed off just to put him out of the misery. All these mentioned characters except Yuki and Momiji, should be more realistically written instead of being too pathetically similar and negative.

2) All main characters haven't grown or developed in the end. For instance, Tohru, from start to finish, continues to be like the 'Mother Teressa'; Kyo is always hot-headed and foul-mouthed, and Yuki is still the calm, quiet stereotypical strait-A pupil at school. I don't expect their characters should be changed drastically like from a good guy to be a bad guy that type of thing, but I do hope these characters would at least learn a lesson through their adventure so that they would become a much more complete person. But this never happens here.

3) The show is overly sentimental in a repetitive way, which really brings down the enjoyment of the show. Like it or not, the show does work perfectly in terms of emotional impacts and that manages to touch your heart and soul sometimes, however, soon such a magic fades away duo to the same old formula they use over and over in an attempt to touch people, which results in a cheesy kind of way. To sum it up briefly, the show can be described into one situation only: every time a new Zodiac character shows up, who might hate or feel curious about Tohru, who then manages to emotionally touch each of them by saying exactly the right thing he/she likes to hear at the right time, and then the cheesy yet heartwarming ""bababa..."" openning music played at the background, that means finally they all end up being impressed by her and love her ever since.

4) Some important information should've been told in details in order to make the story more completed. For example why the Sohmas got cursed with the Chinese zodiac? Throughout all 26 episodes, we have seen enough the Sohmas' members suffering because of the family curse, which results in dyfunctional family, relationship breakups, unable to touch any unrelated person who's the opposite gender or suffering from depression or lack of self-confidence; however, we don't know why the Sohmas is the only family that got attached such a terrible curse. What exactly did their ancestors do so that they would deserve such a suffering? However, we are not given any answers, it seems to me that such a curse plotline just got totally thrown together just for the sake of making a situation. As a result, such a laziness totally brings down the show's promises.

5) There's also one episode in which the Yuki fangirls following the electric girl home in the hope of finding dirts about Tohru, really bothers me. In this episode, they unusually mix the real scenes such as the Tokyo streets and subways with the animated scenes all together just like the animated series, Tooney Toons, where real people and cartoon characters make up the whole show. Personally I don't think such a mix is appropriate since it would only make the rest of the animated scenes appear even more fake!

6) The story ends too soon. After the disappointing filler-like episodes 13 - 23, the conclusion epsidoes from 24 - 26 finally manages to pick up some interests for the story, but it ends, just like that. It ends so sudden that you would wish they would give you a warning first. It's like all ideas have been used up and they urgently need to wrap up the story without thinking about transitional approach. I think the reason why this happens is because the anime doesn't follow the original managa which caused such abrupt ending. If i remember rightly, there are still two more Zodiac members have yet introduced while the tale has already been arranged in a way towards the end. The last three epsides are so emotionally powerful that you would left feeling unhappy about the lack of episodes.

All in all, Fruits basket is a heartwarming tale with positve message despite of these flaws. Although it's far from being one of the best shojo anime, it does satisfy those who enjoys the topics of love, frienships or life-lessons. I would definitely recommend it to anyone despite of myself feeling disappointed by it.",1283212800,3,6504,4.841726618705036
1847630,5,B00008H2G4,My girlfriend isn't so much in the anime but I am. This show helped to changer her opinion and after finishing the show we are shopping together for a new show to watch. This show is funny and constantly playing on the emotions of human beings. That is the best part of the show. People are sad then happy then angry. The show never has a real slow moment and makes me happy to see a show with a bit of common sense. We all see a lot of times that you go through 'dry' spells with shows. I never had that. There are always new characters that are being introduced and new blocks to be built on. The characters all grow together in a way that you often don't see. This is all based on an ancient concept with a modern twist. ANYBODY can pick up this show and fall in love with it. An open mind can make you pick this up and not want to finish it.

The DVD player would have trouble reading what was on there and skipping. Perhaps this is because of an old player, however, a former friend reported the same thing on her copy as well, which wasn't a Viridian collection edition like mine is. Overall, good buy, great anime, not a bad price. Just wanted to raise that issue. Oh, and please do yourself a favor and read the manga. This goes into volumes 1-8 of the manga series and there are 23 volumes total. They can easily make, like 2 more seasons easy with that material! I for one would so buy the complete series if it ever does come out. The manga also has additional stuff not found in the anime; material crucial to the development of the latter part of the story. Give this anime a shot, and don't take it at face value. I'm a male, and I love this because of it's heart-warming nature wrapped in comedy and drama.

1847655,5,B00008H2G4,"Imagine if you moved in with a new family and friends... and found out they turn into animals when you hug them.

That's what Tohru Honda has to deal with in ""Fruits Basket,"" the adaptation of Natsuki Takaya's hit manga. And the manga adaptation is a delightful one -- while the ending gets changed, it's still charming, quirky, slapsticky and sprinkled with darker moments.

Tohru is living in the woods, with only her late mother's photo for company. Exploring one day, she wanders down to a large house, and bumps into the owners: flirtatious Shigure Sohma, and his gorgeous cousin Yuki -- the school's mysterious ""Prince."" After Tohru becomes ill and her tent is destroyed, Yuki and Shigure take her into their home as their new housekeeper... especially since the place is a pigsty.

But Yuki and Shigure are keeping some strange secrets. When Kyo Sohma bursts in to fight Yuki, Tohru tries to stop him -- and the three turn into a dog, cat, and rat. Turns out the Sohma family is cursed with the spirits of the Chinese zodiac, and become those animals whenever they're hugged by a member of the opposite sex. Surprisingly, the mysterious family head Akito allows Tohru to stay with Yuki and Shigure, as long as the volatile Kyo also stays.

And soon Tohru becomes even more wrapped up in the Sohma family, and befriends many members of the zodiac. She, Yuki and Kyo must deal with crazed fanclubs, flamboyant brothers, school festivals, New Year's loneliness, Valentine's day woes, trips to the hot springs, visits to Tohru's mother's grave, and Yuki's band of loyal stalkers.

But Tohru also learns more about the curse -- the traumatic pasts that Momiji, Yuki and Kyo keep hidden, the little ""tiger"" girl who is bullied into silence, and Hatori's tragic romance. And finally Tohru discovers the horrific secret that Kyo is hiding, and the true role of the angry, violent Akito...

It takes a little while for ""Fruits Basket"" to get going, but after a few episodes it finds its footing and charges ahead like Kagura. Just don't expect it to really have an ending -- it doesn't end so much as stop, on a particularly moving story about Kyo and Tohru.

There's lots of romantic tension, slapstick fight scenes (usually involving Kyo and somebody else), quirky comedy (Ayame's kooky cosplay shop), and amusingly tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house!"").

But while the anime is somewhat more lighthearted than the manga, there's also a melancholy side to the story, centering on a curse that is ruining its victims' lives. In the midst of the comedy, we get glimpses of Tohru's tragic past, the families torn apart by the curse, and the Sohmas' isolation from the rest of the world.

Tohru herself is the most lovable character of the bunch -- she has a lot of sorrow over her mother's death and the unkindness of some of her relatives, but she compensates with optimism and friendliness. She borders on Pollyannishness occasionally, but is balanced out somewhat by her oddball friends.

And the Sohmas rule as far as quirkiness is concerned -- there's the quiet ""Prince"" Yuki, the volatile loner Kyo, and the charmingly kooky Shigure. The rest of the family is even more eccentric -- the flamboyant, charming Ayame, Yuki's prodigal brother who is trying ineptly to mend fences. Not to mention the volcanic Haru, the tragic Hatori, and half-German, deceptively cheerful Momiji.

""Fruits Basket"" is by turns hilarious and bittersweet, with plenty of wacky antics, sad backstories and quirky characters. Delightful from beginning to end.",1230595200,12,3602,4.927392739273928
1847656,5,B00008H2G4,"This anime is certainly not without its flaws...
1) Tohru Honda is not very well developed and can even get on my nerves for being so happy and optimistic all the time...
2) Sometimes, the episodes come off as cheesy...
3) It is an angsty series...
4) It can be hard to understand why the Sohmas do not just leave their dysfunctional family...
5) The middle episodes are formulaic/boring...
6) The ending is not really an ending...

These are counterbalanced by...
1) ...but most, if not all, of the other characters are well-developed - they have decent back-stories that we gradually learn and they gradually change.
2) ...but the general messages about fear, acceptance, love, etc are relevant and meaningful.
3) ...but the angst is generally an understandable reaction to the circumstances. Also, this series is about mainly about teenagers, perhaps the most angsty section of the population.
4) ...but in the real world, it is hard for the abused to leave their abuser. This is intensified by the fact that the family is ""cursed.""
5) ...but there is a large cast of dysfunctional family members. Heck, we don't even meet all the Zodiac members (b/c of 6)...but given the story told, everyone would be disappointed if we didn't meet some of the zodiac members.
6) ...but this is because season 1 was written alongside the manga and stopped partway through the manga. Perhaps there will be a season 2, but if not, the manga is now fully finished (in Japan and the USA) and you can always pick it up to find out the ""real"" ending.

But that doesn't stop ""Fruits Basket, Volume 4: The Clearing Sky"" from being a truly, wrenchingly beautiful end to an adorable series. New zodiac members are introduced to Tohru and more madcap comedy ensues (courtesy of Ayame and the demented fanclub), but it reaches new heights in the final two episodes -- where Tohru's love and kindess are faced with new obstacles.

Yuki and Tohru make a weekend trip to Ayame's special clothing shop, and are promptly swept up into Hurricane Ayame, who is all too happy to regale Yuki with every detail of his oddball business. Can the brothers manage to bridge the gap that separates them -- and what exactly is ""The Thing"" that Ayame's girlfriend is dressing Tohru in?

And Tohru is confronted by a pair of new zodiac members. First she encounters Hiro, the antisocial ""sheep"" who resents her friendship with Kisa. Then she meets the beautiful, hyperapologetic daughter of the hot spring lady, Ritsu... only to discover that Ritsu is actually a very effeminate young man, who suffers from self-esteem so low that it dips below Atlantis.

And since Ritsu drives Kyo and Yuki crazy with his screaming apologies (and is teased constantly by Shigure), it's up to Tohru to help him regain some hope. Finally, the president of Yuki's fanclub is haunted by her impending graduation, only to find herself in conversation with the ""prince"" himself. Unfortunately, her jealousy wells up in front of him -- and she has to face the ugly truth about her own feelings.

But the story takes a truly dark turn when Kyo's beloved master Kazuma arrives at Shigure's house, and reveals a horrifying facet of Kyo's curse -- a ghastly transformation that horrifies anyone who sees it. And as she struggles to help Kyo, Tohru begins to learn the reason for Akito's anger and hatred.

""Fruits Basket, Volume 4: The Clearing Sky"" doesn't end the series so much as hit pause -- the curse remains unbroken and the love triangle is still unresolved. As a sort of series climax, the writers even scripted in a harrowing encounter between Tohru and Akito, which gives the series the vague feeling of having been finished.

Before that end, we get ""Fruits Basket's"" signature mingling of heartwarming comedy and bittersweet drama. There are plenty of roiling emotions -- jealousy, loneliness, self-loathing -- but with the realization that there's always a glimmer of hope. The wrenching emotions reach a climax in the final two episodes, when the reasons for Kyo's loneliness are revealed, as well as Kagura's mad crush on him. Horror, romance and drama just soak every scene.

And we still get plenty of comedy, ranging from spoofs (Motoko's high-school drama) to hilarious sight gags (Ritsu rampaging with shrieks of ""I'm sorry!""). Ayame provides most of the humor -- when he's not being sweet and vulnerable, he's rushing around in bridal drag and chitchatting about fashion with his girlfriend. Not to mention the ""rice ball alien in a sailor suit!"" that pops up randomly.

Tohru continues to be a shining beacon at the series' heart -- she's sweet, kind, accepting, and cannot help but try to be kind to anyone, even when Hiro steals her purse and insults her. On the flipside, Kyo's feelings of loneliness and misery are absolutely palpable near the end -- and considering what he turns into, it's not hard to see why.

In fact, all the characters we see are pretty lovable -- Yuki is quiet, cool and a lot tougher than he appears, while Ayame and his girlfriend are insane and quirky, Kisa and Ritsu are adorable, and Shigure is winningly sadistic. Even the deranged hot springs lady appears (""I'm SORRY! I'll do it again! I never should have put myself into the reel! What was I thinking?! I'm SORRY!"" ""I told him we shouldn't have asked her to come..."").

Horror, romance and drama just soak every scene.

And we still get plenty of comedy, ranging from spoofs (Motoko's high-school drama) to hilarious sight gags (Ritsu rampaging with shrieks of ""I'm sorry!""). Ayame provides most of the humor -- when he's not being sweet and vulnerable, he's rushing around in bridal drag and chitchatting about fashion with his girlfriend. Not to mention the ""rice ball alien in a sailor suit!"" that pops up randomly.

Tohru continues to be a shining beacon at the series' heart -- she's sweet, kind, accepting, and cannot help but try to be kind to anyone, even when Hiro steals her purse and insults her. On the flipside, Kyo's feelings of loneliness and misery are absolutely palpable near the end -- and considering what he turns into, it's not hard to see why.

In fact, all the characters we see are pretty lovable -- Yuki is quiet, cool and a lot tougher than he appears, while Ayame and his girlfriend are insane and quirky, Kisa and Ritsu are adorable, and Shigure is winningly sadistic. Even the deranged hot springs lady appears (""I'm SORRY! I'll do it again! I never should have put myself into the reel! What was I thinking?! I'm SORRY!"" ""I told him we shouldn't have asked her to come..."").

The fourth and final volume of the beautiful, hilarious ""Fruits Basket"" series sadly wasn't able to finish the storyline -- but it's still a brilliant finale.",1229385600,,4043,4.844927536231884

1847666,5,B00008H2G4,"Imagine if you moved in with a new family and friends... and found out they turn into animals when you hug them.

That's what Tohru Honda has to deal with in ""Fruits Basket,"" the adaptation of Natsuki Takaya's hit manga. And the manga adaptation is a delightful one -- while the ending gets changed, it's still charming, quirky, slapsticky and sprinkled with darker moments.

Tohru is living in the woods, with only her late mother's photo for company. Exploring one day, she wanders down to a large house, and bumps into the owners: flirtatious Shigure Sohma, and his gorgeous cousin Yuki -- the school's mysterious ""Prince."" After Tohru becomes ill and her tent is destroyed, Yuki and Shigure take her into their home as their new housekeeper... especially since the place is a pigsty.

But Yuki and Shigure are keeping some strange secrets. When Kyo Sohma bursts in to fight Yuki, Tohru tries to stop him -- and the three turn into a dog, cat, and rat. Turns out the Sohma family is cursed with the spirits of the Chinese zodiac, and become those animals whenever they're hugged by a member of the opposite sex. Surprisingly, the mysterious family head Akito allows Tohru to stay with Yuki and Shigure, as long as the volatile Kyo also stays.

And soon Tohru becomes even more wrapped up in the Sohma family, and befriends many members of the zodiac. She, Yuki and Kyo must deal with crazed fanclubs, flamboyant brothers, school festivals, New Year's loneliness, Valentine's day woes, trips to the hot springs, visits to Tohru's mother's grave, and Yuki's band of loyal stalkers.

But Tohru also learns more about the curse -- the traumatic pasts that Momiji, Yuki and Kyo keep hidden, the little ""tiger"" girl who is bullied into silence, and Hatori's tragic romance. And finally Tohru discovers the horrific secret that Kyo is hiding, and the true role of the angry, violent Akito...

It takes a little while for ""Fruits Basket"" to get going, but after a few episodes it finds its footing and charges ahead like Kagura. Just don't expect it to really have an ending -- it doesn't end so much as stop, on a particularly moving story about Kyo and Tohru.

There's lots of romantic tension, slapstick fight scenes (usually involving Kyo and somebody else), quirky comedy (Ayame's kooky cosplay shop), and amusingly tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house!"").

But while the anime is somewhat more lighthearted than the manga, there's also a melancholy side to the story, centering on a curse that is ruining its victims' lives. In the midst of the comedy, we get glimpses of Tohru's tragic past, the families torn apart by the curse, and the Sohmas' isolation from the rest of the world.

Tohru herself is the most lovable character of the bunch -- she has a lot of sorrow over her mother's death and the unkindness of some of her relatives, but she compensates with optimism and friendliness. She borders on Pollyannishness occasionally, but is balanced out somewhat by her oddball friends.

And the Sohmas rule as far as quirkiness is concerned -- there's the quiet ""Prince"" Yuki, the volatile loner Kyo, and the charmingly kooky Shigure. The rest of the family is even more eccentric -- the flamboyant, charming Ayame, Yuki's prodigal brother who is trying ineptly to mend fences. Not to mention the volcanic Haru, the tragic Hatori, and half-German, deceptively cheerful Momiji.

""Fruits Basket"" is by turns hilarious and bittersweet, with plenty of wacky antics, sad backstories and quirky characters. Delightful from beginning to end.",1190505600,,3602,4.927392739273928

If you're looking for something a little heartwrenching, sweet and funny this is it.  I love all the characters in this anime and while some people say that the characters have no depth they aren't really looking at the anime on a whole.  (Its normal for anime and manga to make fun of its characters downfalls and Fruits Basket is no different).  Each of the characters have their own saddness and misfortune making them real.",1189641600,,556,4.63265306122449
1847669,3,B00008H2G4,"Yes, I am one of those people that saw this series before reading any of the manga. My opinion about manga used to be that it was too expensive to collect entire series and I would rather just watch the anime. However, I eventually realized that some manga does a much better job of telling a story than the corresponding anime does - this series is one such example.

All things considered, the Fruits Basket box set is value priced. When this series first came out the DVDs with just a few episodes on each were around $40, but getting the whole box set of 26 episodes is a much better deal.

I think there are enough reviews to tell you what the story is, so I'll just tell you what I think about it.

THE GOOD:

* The story is pretty original.

* It is full of likeable (and even loveable) characters. I like Momiji ^_^

* The psycho ""Prince Yuki Fan Club"" was pretty funny, and it's one of the few things I believe was actually done better in the anime version.

* It's a good show to watch if you just want something entertaining that you don't have to think about too much. It's undeniably adorable.

THE BAD:

* They constantly show flashbacks of things that happened or things people said like 2 seconds ago. It almost insults watchers' intelligence sometimes because you already know the point they're driving at. I mean, come on, we don't need a recap of something that JUST HAPPENED.

* I agree with some other reviewers who said that Tohru's character is not ever really developed. She starts out the same way she ends up.

* The ending was waaaaaaay too soon, and I found it extremely unfulfilling. It doesn't go all the way up to where the manga ends (heck, at the time this review is being written the manga isn't even all out yet.) So you don't really get to see the actual ending, it only goes partway.

* Some of the episodes in the middle are repetitive and tend to drag a bit. Formula: A new person appears, they don't like the idea of Tohru, then they meet her and end up liking her like everyone else. Yuki and Kyo fight and someone transforms at some point. The end.

Again, I really encourage everyone to read the manga for this series. There are so many important plotlines that aren't even mentioned, or are merely hinted at in the anime. There are so many more things explained, and it is given a lot more depth in the manga. It's hard to explain, but it really is very different. So watch if you like, but please, read also.",1189296000,5,2453,4.341356673960613

1847683,5,B00008H2G4,"This anime is extremely beautiful to the eyes and to the heart.

The colors and animation is perfect for the storyline. There are times when the animation gets silly, and there are times when the animation is absolutely breathtaking.

The characters are all well developed and well explored, even though some characters might only be in one episode.

The voices in the English cast are great! The main three, Tohru, Yuki and Kyo are done especially perfectly. Tohru's inflections d a great job of crossing over the politeness of the character that may not be 'literally' translated. Yuki's soft, but alluring voice matches his looks and his personality which I actually preffer over the female voice used in the Japanese version. Though Yuki's voice is gentle, it is very obviously a man's. Kyo's strong, forceful tone is exactly perfect for his strong, guarded, hot-tempered personality. At times when Kyo shows his soft side, his voice also softens and it really shows how deeep down that hard exterior is a caring human being. Hatori's voice is very monotonous, but I think it works well for that character. Hatori says some of the most heartwrenching things in the anime and the fact that he says them all with very little emotion just hits my heart harder.

It is very original in the sense of it's plotline.

The script is probably what draws me the most to Fruits Basket. The English translation is wonderful! Being an American, some things didn't make sense, culturally to me when I watched the episodes with subtitles on the internet and one really misses out on the effect of watching the translated version. They did a great job and the way they worded things is very touching.",1186358400,2,1688,4.826989619377162

They have the zodiac curse upon them making certain members of the family transform into the animals of the zodiac (including the cat) when they are embraced by a member of the opposite sex or when they are under a great deal of stress.  The three main zodiac members in the series are Shigure, a writer and the zodiac dog; Yuki, the rat; and Kyo, the cat who has a curse worse than anyone can imagine.  This certainly makes for an interesting time when Tohru Honda, a high school girl and classmate of Yuki.  Tohru has a very positive outlook at life and comes to live with these three Sohmas by accident after her mother dies in a car accident.  She becomes the housekeeper for the family and also seems to be the only one that can keep Yuki and Kyo from fighting (well, fighting a lot anyways).  She comes to know the Sohma secret and becomes immersed in the family's life.  Tohru also brings a kindness into the family that everyone of them has been lacking while simultaneously changing everyone of their lives in the process; she is the light in the Sohma family's dark curse.

I recommend the Japanese with subtitles. I won't go into a synopsis, or a summary. It's pointless as other people always do that. But, the story itself is charming, and leads to some very excellent comedy scenes.

I don't know if I'm just gunna spew out the same facts as every other praising review does, but I think that, regardless, this anime deserves all the compliments it can get.

One reason why I love it so much?

Its dubbing doesn't kill my ears -- trust me, this is something very new. The tones, voices, music, and sound effects are something that you take for granted. Watch another anime with bad dubbing and irritating music, and you'll see the difference (in my opinion).

I originally got into this series because of the manga (which I encourage you to buy). I don't keep up with the manga anymore, but recently, I've gone back to watching the anime. Know why?

It's hilarious. And well done. And a cute story. Did I mention hilarious? Subtle lines and character habits, not to mention the characters' interactions kill me every time.

True, if you're not a fan of animes whose episodes end in morals, this may not be the best thing for you. The morals may be ""overdone"" sometimes, but in Fruits Basket, they are presented in a way that is cute, original, and in a way that made me, personally, start to think. Being jealous of someone else's good qualities is now translated into riceballs and plums; kindness is now translated into different shapes and forms, i.e. a candle.

The affection between the characters is twisted, in some cases -- weak, and in some cases -- strong. Bold and stubborn personalities clash. Personal problems cause fights. Mistakes done in the past ruin their chance for a future. Outcasts, facades, protection, love, suffering. Every emotion in this anime is beautiful and expressed not just through what the character's say, but the actions they take.

There is no real romance with Tohru and for that, I am grateful. I love all the characters too much to truly be happy with just one being picked -- another surprise. And no, it's not because all the Sohma's are yummy. ^^

This anime is worth every star I give it. And while the manga is not over, the anime is at 26 episodes. Not too long, but not irritatingly short. I don't care how you buy it, but I hope you give it a try. This anime is not my favorite, but I do adore it enough to write a review.

Need I say more?

""Promise, I'll be fine. And I'll take great care of the house while you're gone! You are talking to the girl who -- THE BATH WATER!! I LEFT IT RUNNING AGAIN!!""

The story is great throughout the show, and the characters develop well (and are very amusing most of the time).  I wish they would come out with a 2nd season or something!!!!!

I wouldn't present this series to children under middleschool-age though.  Also speaking from a somewhat religious stance, there are a few questionable things in this series.  There's a good amount of cussing.  Plus the characters under the ""Soma curse"" are naked when they turn back to their human form (but you don't see anything, everything that's private is covered by smoke).  Also if you're extremely conservative, you'll probably find the sexual orientation of a couple of the characters questionable.  There are also a couple of episodes that are really violent.

Its a good series and not a chessey as you'd expect Its fun at first kind of like a sitcom and then as you get further and further into it you discover how deep this story is(espcially with the manga).

the story is alot of fun to In the anime you get to meet the cat, rat, dog, bunny, dragon,boar, cow,snake,sheep, tiger and monkey and in the manga you meet all of the chinese zodiac. i breing this up because its cool to see how the charecters personality blends with thier animals.  the story  contains some formula anime plot like a perverted charecter,cross dressing, guys with femnine faces, long hair, wierd colored hair and of corse high school uniforms. but it also has some less commen stuff like drama, love triangles,realist relationships, regret, death, hatered(true hate that is), painful times, and alot of change and people moving on. these quirky and serious factors combine for a great show entertaning for most perople

I unlike most people prefer to watch it in english(i tend to prefer english dubbed anime) manily because i was insulted when i saw it in japanese. I may be crazy but yukis voice actor was so clearly a girl it hurt. He already has a girly face and has to were a dress(funny episode^.^) at least let his VOICE match his actual gender:P any way. the only voice i don't like in the english is ritzu. anyway this is just my opinon.

Tohru is a character that represents the values that any parent would like to see in their children: honesty, perserverance, loyalty, dedication, generosity. Being a mom of two girls, Tohru was easy to adore. I would recommend this story for any family to watch together.

A friend recommmended the series and after reading the first 3 mangas, I was hooked. I bought the entire DVD set, not wanting to read the whole manga series and I enjoyed the DVD's. Yet I'm only giving this 4 stars because the DVD series was shortened compared to the manga series. I'm NOT saying the DVD series is bad though because it REALLY was entertaining. It's just the DVD didn't really own up to the manga series. The complexity of the whole story was shortened. Other than that, the Fruits Basket story is charming, sweet, mysterious and all that good stuff. You will instantly fall in love with the story and characters.

The Story:

The Sohma family with a curse that changes them into a member of the Chinese ZOdiac when touched by a member of the opposite sex. The Sohma family has kept their secret well hidden until a spunky, kind-hearted girl by the name of Tohru Honda stumbles upon their secret and the lives of the Sohmas changes forever. Now she must keep their secret hidden or else. As the story unfolds, you'll learn the secrets many other characters esp. those of the SOhma family as Tohru encounters other members of the ZOdiac.

An awesomely good story.",1146528000,3,1314,4.559322033898305

Fruits Basket is that anime I cant begin to describe this anime! It is simply amazing, each character has its very own unique personality, each episode makes you want to see more and more, the music is nice, the situations original, some funny some heart touching but all enjoyable.

And well its the first time I find a character as strong as Tohru. You'll know what I mean when you see it.

If this anime doesnt make you cry laugh smile or move you in someway i honestly think there is something wrong with you, it has all the elements that makes a great anime.

Although they followed the story line pretty good, they totally messed it up in the end, with Kyo, Tohru, Yuki, and Kazuma. In the manga it was totally different, and Shigure barely had anything to do with it. Akito wasn't there, either. Although I know that they had to end it somehow and that they couldn't just wait for the series to be done (although if they wanted to make it good then they should have done just that), they could have made it a little more like the book.

Honda-san fills in various emotional needs that each character lacks as the episodes progress.  She obviously brings the family closer together-the artwork is well done, and the English dubbing is decent for a change-including the music, although you can still pick up the feelings by paying attention to the subtitles with the original Nihongo voice actors.  This anime was unique to me because it really attempts to draw your emotional state into the story, and has many ""feel good"" moments.  I would have enjoyed it a little better, but the ending of the series following Honda-san's ""trial"" leaves you without really knowing the long term resolution.  You just have to assume that everything worked out as the ending disrupts the pace of the story and characters that you get used to.  So I can't give it a 5 star rating because of that.

1847718,5,B00008H2G4,"Definitely, Fruits Basket is a series that will capture you with its charm, friendliness, and especially, its philosophy.

Talking strictly about the series, it features Tohru Honda, a 16-year-old high-school girl that lives in a tent at the beginning of the story. One day, while going to school, she finds out that the garden where she lives is private property, as she meets Shigure Sohma, the owner. She also finds out that Yuki Sohma, one of her classmates, lives there. At the evening of thay day, she is found in the garden by Shigure and Yuki; she apologized and requested for additional time, but then they make a deal and Tohru becomes the housekeeper of the Sohmas as exchange of a room. At first she did not want to bother them living there, but she accept the proposal of the Sohmas. That is the base point where Tohru Honda begins to build a strong and enviable friendship with Yuki and Kyo Sohma, Yuki's cousin who appears later in episode 1. However, the Sohmas are not a common family. Several of its members have a strange curse: when hugged by someone of the opposite sex, they transform into an animal of the Chinese Zodiac; the animal depends on the year the cursed member was born. This fact, at first, surprises Tohru a litte bit, but then she takes it as normal. First proof of the philosophy that Tohru Honda demonstrates: Be respectful of your friends no matter what they look like!

As the story goes, Tohru Honda is always caring about others, especially Yuki and Kyo Sohma, and these demonstrations of her thinkings are the most appealing stuff of this series. She shows that one must be oneself, that one must never give up, that one must be kind with everyone without considerations... and so many other phrases that all together define Tohru's personality. I can say that is why Fruits Basket was in 2001 winner of almost every existent award in Japan: Fruits Basket won even more than Inuyasha, and by a considrable difference: Tohru Honda was so far the most popular character, even more that the sum of the votes for Inuyasha and Kagome Higurashi. This was the main reason I bought this box set, and after analyzing the series, I can say the same results.

About the box set itself, it is bigger that ADV thin boxes, but the discs are a lot better used in terms of content. This set not only contains the episodes but also extras about several facts such as how the anime was made, the seiyuus, interviews and curious features. However, although I understand that Funimation is serious about illegal copy, they go a little bit too far by putting seals on every side of the box set, even over the slots where you put your fingers to open a single DVD case. I ended up with a medium bag of garbage, full of seals and plastic. But this is a minimum and superficial matter, so it is not important after all (unless you consider it).

Therefore, Fruits Basket, this box set, is definitely a great product by all means. The series present a great philosophy that breaks any barrier, which is doubtlessly the main reason of the success of this anime. With these reasons, you must buy this one.",1140912000,10,3121,4.597845601436266
1847719,5,B00008H2G4,"Tohru Honda is a 16-year old girl who lost her mother to an automobile accident. She lives with her grandfather, but his house is being remodeled and she wants to stay in the area so that she can go to school. Deciding she can't be a burden to her friends, she pitches up a tent in the nearby woods to live in. On her way to school, she comes across the home of Prince Yuki Sohma, who is the most admired guy in school.

 Yuki and his cousin, Shigure, are walking back home one evening when they stumble across Tohru's tent. Feeling pity on her, they invite her to stay with them because of the impending dangers one might face out in the woods. Sure enough, a landslide claims Tohru's tent and all her belongings are buried. Yuki, along with some ""friends,"" clean up the area and restore Tohru's things to her.

 Shigure and Yuki offer Tohru a place to live, and in exchange for her room and board, she becomes their housekeeper. Things are just getting settled in with Tohru and her new ""family,"" when wayward cousin, Kyo Sohma, comes back from training in the mountains. Kyo and Yuki do not get along. During a scuffle between the two, Tohru decides to step in and break it up. In doing so, she tackles Kyo and he turns into a cat!

 So begins the adventures in Fruits Basket (episode 5 gives the explanation of the show's title). Come to find out, the Sohma clan are under a curse. If they are embraced by someone of the opposite sex, they turn into animals of the Chinese zodiac! Yuki becomes a rat, Kyo a cat, and Shigure a dog. The consequence of an outsider knowing their secret is to have their memory erased, but the exception lies in Tohru. She is trusted with the family secret and she vows that she will tell no one.

 I took Fruits Basket as a very lighthearted and romantic comedy. Tohru seemed a bit too happy-go-lucky for my taste, but her sugary viewpoints seem to be just the right thing in helping members of the Sohma family cope with their particular problems. Even fiery Kyo can't help but let his guard down and talk sensible with Tohru sometimes, which is really saying something about her persona.

 I was first drawn into FB by the voice acting. The English dubbing is exquisite, although Justin Cook being in charge of the VA made FB feel like a Yu Yu Hakusho reunion of some sort. Immediately, I was calling out the names of Yusuke, Suzaku, Kayko, Kurama, and Botan when it was Hatsuharu, Kyo, Tohru, Shigure, and Shigure's editor on the screen, respectively. If you are fans of the VA from YYH, then FB should be enjoyable to listen to.

 Speaking of sound, be prepared to be bombarded with a lot of background music and realistic sounds. It just about drowned out the dialogue in some parts and at one point I had to put on the subtitles to find out what they were saying.

 Character design is something worth seeing too. Prepare to be throttled by big eyes, especially those of Tohru. Perhaps the animators did that on purpose to really emphasize Tohru's bubbly and lovey-dovey personality. The Sohmas are all attractive, especially Yuki and Kyo, but Shigure is my personal favorite, as he is ever carefree and accepts all the Sohmas for who they are. He also likes to tease his editor and get playful with high school girls. His dialogue is quotable stuff and my sister and I like to talk in Shigure-tongue now and again.

 Plenty of laughs and action (if you're into house demolition and the occasional bout of martial artistry). Language is clean for the most part - no sexual slang and the majority of swearing belongs to Kyo (because of reasons you'll find in the show).

 Fruits Basket is not to be missed. Enjoy plenty of comedic performances, heart felt moments and have a hankie in hand for the finale. A must have in any anime collection!",1137888000,10,3781,4.494890510948905
1847720,5,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket is probably one of the best anime series your going to find. It has everything an anime series would want--comedy, humor, romance, and even some action if you consider the bickering between Kyo and Yuki action.

Fruits Basket is about Honda Tohru, a 16 year old high school girl who lives in a tent b/c her mother had just passed away and she didn't want to burden anyone with having to take care of her. Going to school one day, she happens upon the house of her classmate Sohma Yuki. When the Sohmas discover her tent they invite her to live with them in exchange for the housekeeping chores. But little did she know what she was getting herself into. When she looses her balance and grabs onto Kyo for support he turns into a cat! The Sohmas are a cursed family--when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex they turn into their respective zodiac animals.

What is so good about Fruits Basket? One we can relate to a lot of the events in the show. Though we may not have just had our mother die like Tohru did, we all go through hardship. However Tohru can be seen as such a wonderful role model. Though she has hardship she always looks to the bright side of things, never being gloomy. She is the most unselfish person for she always worries about everyone else's problems instead of her own.

Why is the anime called Fruits Basket? Well you'll just have to watch and see for the reason behind the show's title is reveled in episode 5 when we learn more about Tohru's past and character.

Fruits Basket is an anime I would reccommend to everyone even if you generally do not watch shoujo anime. It has enough humor to keep you addicted and watching (Shigure-san's sarcastic and idiotic remarks). All in all it's a great anime...so if you've never seen it I truly reccommend it.

1847721,5,B00008H2G4,"This is the most heart-warming and touching anime series I've ever seen. It's shoujo, meaning it's geared towards girls but anyone would enjoy watching this. There are no gun or sword battles, transforming robots, or flying demons but even my teenage son loves it because of all the funny and outrageous characters (our favorites are Shigure, Kyo, Momiji & Ayame).

You meet and get to know the cursed Sohma family through the eyes of orphaned high-school student Tohru Honda. Everyone has a story to tell, some quite heart-wrenching. I was touched by all their stories. Heck, I even felt sorry for Akito!

Although I prefer to watch anime in their original Japanese, I think that Funimation did a SUPERLATIVE job of dubbing and translating these series. In my opinion all the American voice actors were excellent! I really liked Laura Bailey as Tohru but my hat goes off to John Burgmeier who was just AWESOME as Shigure!

Only 26 episodes long, it ends a little too soon. Nevertheless, this is a worthwhile investment. BUY this and add an excellent anime series to your collection!",1130889600,38,1083,4.875

GREAT!!!
Fantastic comedy, cute scenes, interesting plot line.
Also many gut-wrenching tear-jerker deep scenes combined with side splitting comedy, combined with action related to strange plot.

In other words, this is the most bipolar anime I have ever watched.

HOWEVER!!!!!

BAD things!
Rather unresolved ending
Some say that things are resolved in the ending, but I was stuck pulling my hair out. Although there are rumors of a second season, nothing has happened yet so its rather frustrating to have such an abrupt ending to the series. Yet it was still also worth every penny for all the really good episodes.

Also the english dubbing is horrible, so it's worth watching in Japanese with subtitles if necessary.",1128729600,8,750,5.065040650406504
1847723,5,B00008H2G4,"The last disc of the first season of Fruits Basket starts off with a visit to Ayami's shop by Yuki and Tohru. Little does Yuki know that when Ayami says he sells ""Male romantic Fantasies"" what he means is that he sells ladies lingerie he designs and hand makes himself. This throws Yuki off, but he decides to try to continue bonding with his older brother anyways, and while he's at it he gets the added bonus of seeing Tohru sample some of Ayami's handiwork.

Another member of the zodiac crosses paths with Tohru; this time it's Hiro Sohma, born the year of the ram. Hiro is roughly Kisa Sohma's age, and it is because of Kisa that he decides to approach Tohru, a woman he finds obnoxious. But he must do it, especially if it is for Kisa. After that yet another member shows up, this time it's Ritsu Sohma, the monkey, a man who is not what he seems at first glance, and has severe anxiety problems.

The height of this disc comes in the last three episodes, all more or less a continuation of each other up into the climax of the series. When Kyo's master shows up the house goes into an uproar. Apparently along with training Kyo, Kagura, and Yuki, Master Kazuma acted as a surrogate father to Kyo, raising him in his own home since he was a young child after the unfortunate death of his Mother. At first Kyo is reluctant to show his happiness at Kazuma's arrival in front of Yuki, but he is nothing short of ecstatic to have his former master about, and he begs him to remove him from that house. Kazuma decides to push Kyo further and forcibly convinces him to reveal his true self to Tohru. This requires that Kyo remove his beaded bracelet, then his original self emerges in all of it's horrifying glory...What will Tohru say when she sees him like this? How will she react? Will he lose her if she sees him as he truly is?

I can't give everything away, nor would I want to. The climax to this series is so moving, I was crying by the end of this three part episode. There were parts that were altered from the manga...or at the very least switched about, I have not read the last four volumes of the manga yet so it is hard for me to say how accurate it is, but there are many tender moments that have been added to create more character depth and dynamics in the plot. Yuki and Kyo have a bonding moment in the end of the ""Revelation of Kyo's true self"" episode, and it's almost obvious where the two of them stand with Tohru as far as romantic love goes. Even Shigure, who is normally there for comic relief, has a few serious moments that turn out to be nothing short of heartwarming. Arisa and Hana show up as well, to show just how much they care about Tohru. Even Akito turns up in the ending of the series, and there are some nail biting screen moments between him and Tohru, but they are resolved well enough to lead into a second season....if there will ever be one.

I guess that could be my only real complaint about the way this series turned out... that the rest of it has not been animated yet. Personally, I can't wait to see where the members of the zodiac go from here. Everything was left at such a cliff hanger as far as character development goes that it would be an utter shame if the studio that produced it failed to get another season off the ground.  Do I have any predictions for the future? Of course I do, but mine come from the knowledge I have gleaned from reading further into the manga series than has been animated up until this point, so I am going to keep those thoughts to myself, for the moment. All I can say is...wow... I hope more gets made soon... I'm going to go into withdrawal until it does.",1128470400,5,3647,4.279710144927536

What ensues is their heartwarming tale of self discovery and slavation via the always sugary sweet, almost to the point of sickeningly so, Tohru Honda. This final DVD is a great conclusion to the anime series, and answers some questions about Akito and the zodiac curse. (I won't spoil it!) However, after it was over, my first thought was ""eeeehhhh??!""

Quite a few people complained or commented on what seemed somewhat like a clipped ending, and the reason why is because it really isn't the ending in the original story! The anime sort of cuts off at volume 11 of the original manga- of a 16 or 17 volume series! The fact is, if you want a little more Furuba or a little more closure, read the manga then watch the DVD- it answers a few more questions and completes the plot a little more.",1127001600,,1236,4.618181818181818
1847728,4,B00008H2G4,"DVD navigation is great as far as I am concerned.

There are many instances when the background music drowns the conversations that I couldn't figure out what the characters were saying even after I tried to rewind it.

My biggest complain though is about Tohru Honda's character. Before anything else, I just want to make it clear that I do not hate Tohru Honda. I have been an anime lover for years and I've never hated a villain or any female anime character. I've never disliked Yanagi of Flame of Recca even when all she could do is cry and say Recca's name. I am the type who would defend Haruko of Slam Dunk with all my might because some didn't like her just because she likes Rukawa Kaede. I do not hate Rukawa's fangirls or Yuki's fangirls. I look at them like humans, with desires and longings and faults and all.

However, I am very disturbed by Tohru's character. She is so unreal. It is very obvious that she was plucked out of a girl's fantasy of being around beautiful men and being swooned over and yet very innocent about it. Now, even Yanagi and Haruko got to be surrounded by bishonens (beautiful men). What makes Tohru so different is that she is so perfect, so perfect that it makes me cringe. At 16, she is pretty, kind, goes to school and works as a cleaner aside from being a housekeeper at the Sohma house. At the Sohma house, she cleans, cooks, do laundry, wash dishes, etc, etc that you would wonder why she still has time to have friends. She smiles all the time and knows how to say the right words at the right time. EVERYBODY LIKES HER! Are you cringing yet? Almost every character in the anime would change their outlook just because they were touched by this kind and innocent looking girl. Take note that those characters are damaged in some way and yet they found some solace in her. Talk about ego.

Rules were bent just to accommodate her. Every outsider's memories were erased but she was spared. Why? Who knows? Even the heartless Akito was touched by her sentimentality. It is not clear if it was because she is pretty and kind. How would the Sohmas know that she won't betray them? Because she is perfect!

I just didn't like the portrayal of Tohru Honda's character. What kind of anime creator would make a girl take her dead mother's picture to the hot springs so that they could bathe together?

Not only Tohru Honda is a typical Mary Sue, she is also a typical big-eyed, short-skirted high school girl. What could be worse?

Yes, Virginia, there is more. All the Sohmas are goodlooking! I don't even feel bad for Kyou when he transformed into a hideous beast because I know it is still him, just a different form. What made me feel for his character is because he was so left out when he was tricked by the rat in the zodiac. And I am a cat lover!

However, parents-dying-and-brothers-not-getting-along plot are so common that it fails to arouse sympathy.

On the plus side, there are a lot of lessons that we could get. How ironic is it that for all the supposedly mature characters, a younger boy would stand out? Momiji has probably one of the most painful and touching experiences. How can anyone not cry when he said that no matter how painful the memories were, he would never, ever choose to forget them? Personally, that is the highlight of this anime.

Hattori is another one who had a very painful past. How tragic must have it been to be the one to erase one's memories from a beloved?

Shigure is probably my most liked character because he is so real. He doesn't fail to make you laugh. He doesn't hide his feelings. He says things as they are and he doesn't care what people think of him. He likes teasing people and doesn't hide his penchant for high school girls.",1125792000,,3725,4.463235294117647

Fruits Basket is about a girl Torouh Honda, who is orphaned and gets to live with the Sohma family. They are cursed by the Zodiac and they turn into zodiac animals whenever hugged by a member of the opposite sex.

It's a romantic anime, and like other costumers have said, you'll laugh a lot, and cry a little, perhaps more if you're like me.

1847730,5,B00008H2G4,"I have my daughters to thank for my discovery of ""Fruits Basket.""  Without their interest in the manga and then the anime series, I probably never would have thought to give it a second glance.  But I'm so glad that I did.

My first impression of the story was that it was the ultimate adolescent girl fantasy: a teenage girl meets several boys who, when she hugs them (usually by accident), they transform into animals of the Zodiac.  What could be more precious...and nauseating?  And yet, the story that develops from this premise -- a family whose members are cursed, generation upon generation, by the Zodiac animals -- is rich in character development and has much more depth than I originally expected.  This is a story of mystery and love, told with both pathos and humor.

The animation for ""Fruits Basket"" is so beautiful as to defy description.  I'd be hard-pressed to find a single frame of animation that wasn't worthy of displaying on a wall in a gallery somewhere, and when such gorgeous drawings are put together in such a clever, unexpected way, the result is absolutely breathtaking.  The drawing style is light and funny, or somber and muted, or bright and colorful, as it serves the story and the characters.

And what characters!  Tohru Honda is the driving force behind the story, the teenager who meets and befriends the Sohmas.  Her story is a tragic one, but the brave face she puts on it and her ruthlessly positive outlook are admirable.  Quite simply, Tohru has a way of looking at the world that is infectious, and affects everyone around her in surprising ways.  Tohru's best friends prior to meeting the Sohmas are Uo and Hana, who make frequent appearances in the story and add a great deal to it.  They go to school with Yuki Sohma (who changes into the Rat), the ""Prince"" of their school with his own fan club of appreciative girls.  Yuki lives with an older relative, Shigure (the Dog), an eccentric writer and perhaps my personal favorite character of the whole series.  Kyo Sohma (the Cat) also comes to live with them, and the long-standing antagonism between Kyo and Yuki quickly becomes the stuff of legend.  As the series goes on, Tohru meets more members of the Sohma clan.  Not all of them shape-change into animals, but many of them do, and before it's over she has met nearly every Zodiac animal.  We come to know each of the Sohmas, and through them, more about Tohru as well.  By the end of the show, these are characters that you can't help but care about.

""Fruits Basket"" has a definite target audience -- adolescent girls like Tohru -- and as such, love and romance play a part.  But the good thing is that romance is not the only underlying element of the story, and it's told in such a clever, charming way that it doesn't become cloying or overdone.  Along the way, the story also examines love that turns to obsession, bonds of friendship, family ties, and acceptance of differences (sometimes big ones) between different people.  This last theme, acceptance, runs through the whole series, but becomes most powerful in the last few episodes.  If you think the original story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" but take away the Disney gloss and bring it back down to its classic roots, then add a background of Eastern rather than Western culture, you might be getting close to the sort of thematic effect ""Fruits Basket"" has.

These themes are all there under the surface of ""Fruits Basket,"" but the surface is a story that made me laugh out loud more times than I can count, and made my eyes mist over almost as often. And in the last episode, it made me cry openly like a little kid -- not quiet tears that slip down your cheek, but the sort of tears that hurt your eyes and make your nose feel puffy.  Only the most jaded heart could watch the whole series and not be moved by what happens in the last episode.  If you think that a bunch of drawings and voices put together with the right story can't pack an emotional wallop...think again.

""Fruits Basket"" is funny, it's honest, it's clever, it's beautiful to look at, it's unabashedly positive, and it's an absolute joy to watch.  If you're an adult and you have kids (especially girls), don't pop this in the DVD player and walk away...sit down with them to watch it.  It's the kind of thing that kids and adults can really enjoy together, and it's something that will stay with you afterwards.

This particular box set is a great value, since Funimation was kind enough to stuff lots of episodes onto each of the four discs. The dub is EXCELLENT, one of the best I've ever heard, and just as good as the original Japanese. One complaint I have is that Funimation didn't put in an extra subtitle track, so you have to turn them on when you see Japanese text that they translate.

Character interactions are truly classic, especially the fights between Yuki and Kyo. Characters grow in maturity and wounds are healed, all centered around the miracle girl Toru Honda. This is what makes it so charming, and the life lessons that are presented are certainly ones we should learn from.

This is definitely a ""shoujo"" anime. If you are looking for an action packed one, this is not your type. Its all slow and calm paced, but done in such a manner as to not bore you. I give this one 5 stars for sheer enjoyability. There is some mild language, but I'd say this is good for all ages.",1117411200,5,1229,4.266094420600858

The odd conceit is that the family has thirteen members who turn into the animals of the Chinese zodiac (you know, year of the rat, and stuff, with the cat added to the normal 12).  They adopt a plucky girl who has been orphaned.

The characters that are so human in their emotions and problems, yet the Somas have their animal characteristics seamlessly blended in.  The character's personalities are not one-dimensional... they are shaped by their experiences.  Momiji is an excellent example.  He seems young and childish for his age, but through the series you discover he has a mature, philosophical side, odd in one so young.  The show makes you think about human interactions, about how one person can make a difference, about who you are, and who you want to be.

There are many other examples of how the plot, humor, tragedy, characters, animation, and theme all appeal to me.  The biggest testament to this series that I can give... is that it makes me feel better.  When I am stressed, upset, depressed, or just feeling out of sorts, I watch Fruits Basket to laugh, cry, and relax.  It sounds hokey, but I end up with a warm feeling inside.

1847741,5,B00008H2G4,"I love this anime not only because of the originality of the story but also because the characters are all so different and lovable in their own way, it just makes you want to hug em' all .. (well maybe not all of them, but most).

The story I thought it was very original, because it's about this girl: Torhu Honda who suddenly finds herself living in a tempt in the woods after her mother died and she decided to not trouble her grandfather. Now, a regular person wouldn't care living with their grandparents, but Torhu is the extremely nice, sweet girl that's always apologizing. At a first glance her personality might seem annoying and just plain stupid, but actually is not so bad when mixed with the other dif personalities on the anime. She is the main character, because of her many things happen in the anime, you'll see. She then meets the Sohma family(don't know if that's how u write it) and starts living with them.

So far is not interesting at all, now here comes the good part. This family has the curse of the chinese zodiac. Which means that they transform into the animals of the zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex, or when they're feeling weak or sick. So the story revolves around Torhu meeting all of the members of the family and basically changing their lives. She is the only person outside the family that knows their secret and that means she is in a dangerous position, given the fact that the head of the family(a guy named Akito) has a history of being violent and traumatizing the family ... so who knows what he'll do to her?

It's a SUPER FUNNY anime, it makes you pee your pants from time to time .. and it has mild romance between 2 of the characters and the girl. Every character is hilarious and it's really an anime you will want to watch more than once!

The ending of the anime leaves you wanting for more though .. they don't quite explain everything and they leave you in the air. Some questions are not answered, to some people that's fine .. but to other people (like me) who just want more, there's the manga!! Characters that do not appear in the anime, do so in the manga. As well as things never mentioned in the anime.

GREAT SERIES !!!!!!!! totally worth your time!!!",1116374400,3,2233,4.4365853658536585
1847742,5,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket is one of the few series that I've seen to the end and the ending has not ruined the rest of it.

First off, watch it in Japanese!  The dub is good too, but I like the voice acting better in the original Japanese.

I'm sure you know the premise of the story if you're reading this.  Sohma family curse...animals of the zodiac...hilarity ensues.

I've read reviews that say that Fruits Basket (or Furuba) is demeaning to women.  That's not true.  I don't like Kisa, but the other women are all very strong (ok don't count the hot spring owner...).  I think of it more as a social commentary.  Women can make a difference too!  Tohru is a strong girl because she can solve so many problems and remain happy in spite of anything.  I feel that Natsuki Takaya was also making fun of how much apologizing and modesty there is in everyday Japanese culture.  ""Gomenasai...hounto ni gomenasai!!!""  (""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"")

Favorite characters:

1st: Hanajima - She is my hero!  I am learning the art of the poison waves.

2nd: Ayame - nothing needs to be said here!

3rd: Motoko - I know some people hate the Yuki club fan girls, but they are people too!

Favorite episodes:

18 - I really like what they do with the layout of the episode.  Also, Hanajima is still the best!

20 - Hehe, she's apologizing to the audience ... and then there's Ayame's store...

I tried to keep track, and I don't think they introduced all of the zodiac.  Also, some of the characters, based on their animals, could not be in the grade that they are in.  For example, how is Tohru (a dog) in the same year as Yuki (the rat)?  And how can Momiji (the rabbit) and Hatsuhara (the ox) be in the same year?  And how can the snake and the dog be in high school at the same time?

Oh, and you can play that game with new characters.  When you're first introduced to a new character, you ask ""man or woman?"".  If you can do that in a series, it really can't be bad!

I don't think you can watch Fruits Basket and come away depressed.  It's really inspiring and funny.  So please watch it!",1115856000,6,2071,4.323759791122716

What I liked, was the broad rage of charc's that portrayed the weakness of humans. What most people don't understand, is that they see Tohru in constant ""happy"" mode. but, more astute readers and watchers, will notice that she uses her happy demeanor as a front. you'll see what I mean if you watch it...

Anways, This anime was wonderful, really it was. I found it very well thought out, and even though some parents won't like the ""cursing"" in it (some words are bleeped for comidic reasons). the conversations were very close to what teens talk like In Real Life.

Now, I was able to relate to some of the charc's, and so were alot of my friends, that I forced to sit down and watched. This is what makes the anime so wonderful and diverse, it can bring alot of people together, and realize that there is always hope. and it just takes a little kindness to realize it. Even the members that are as happy as a rabbit, have had horrible things happen to them.

There are some who feel this anime delves to deeply into the human mind. but in all honesty, I Think it needs to! the deepness of the anime is what makes it so enjoyable and relateable!

1847745,3,B00008H2G4,"What's the most over-used word in the English language?

Tell you in a moment.

For now, meet the Sohmas. They're not your standard family. Because of a zodiac curse, various members turn into one of the Chinese zodiac creatures when embraced by the opposite sex.  So they've shielded themselves (to one degree or another) from the rest of the world.  In the first episode we are introduced to a household with three of the male Sohma's; Shigure (an older cousin/writer), Yuki and Kyo (both high school students). Others eventually join in. Yuki, being the rat, and Kyo, being the cat, do NOT get along. At all. Ever.

Enter Tohru Honda, a high school girl (and classmate of the aloof, distant Yuki) who recently lost her only family member, her mother whom she loves and misses. This doesn't seem to have cost her a generally sunny disposition, though.  One day enroute to school she happens across the Sohma house. After they discover that she's temporarily living in a tent, they convince Tohru to accept their chivalrous offer to live with them. She insists that, in exchange, she repay them by performing housekeeping and cooking chores. Of course she soon discovers the Sohma secret, but is allowed to stay without her memory `wiped', the usual practice for these situations.

Tohru is a textbook anime high school girl; adorable, long-legged, short-skirted, and demure.  With all the cooking and cleaning to be done for the guys of the house this would seem to be the perfect training ground for a submissive housewife.  But ordinary Tohru has extraordinary powers that can potentially change the Sohma's bleak, closed existence; a bottomless well of kindness, unending compassion, extreme empathy, unwavering loyalty, and the ability to gently say exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. Really, it's almost as if Star Trek's Deanna Troi were reborn. Tohru becomes the Sohma's de-facto councilor.  Which brings us to the most overused word in the English language:

`Love.'

OK, maybe it's just me, but it seems like that single word is used to cover so many diverse situations it can become meaningless.  Greek, on the other hand, has a number of words that can be used in place of our one like `eros' (romance, sensuality), filios (family, brotherhood), and agape (spiritual, godly).  As Tohru learns more about the Sohmas, she approaches them with loads of agape, and eventually filios is thrown in.

This is a refreshing change from the standard anime fare when a lead character is surrounded by numerous members of the opposite sex, leading to `fan service' hijinx and a romantic storyline or ending (eros).  But that's not in evidence throughout this series.  Tohru's love for Yuki, Kyo and the rest of the clan is a growing, genuine, unconditional affection and appreciation for the people they are (agape), not the boyfriend that one of them might be.  And Tohru is a wonderful character, the kind of friend everyone wants, especially in high school.

As promising as that sounds, the story tends to be predictable.  The first dozen episodes lean toward a gentle sitcom style with the aura of a nice, quiet bedtime story.  At appropriately inopportune moments, the Sohma's are accidentally `poofed' into their animal forms.  Amusing, yes, but after awhile it's not exactly `filling'.

Changes occur at episode 13.  We find that the Sohma clan is not only cursed, it also has its dysfunctional side.  While this adds a good touch of unease to the story, it sometimes lends itself to characters and sub plots that are more irritating than interesting.  The editor and animators also add a few new techniques to the show's mix; perhaps they were getting a bit bored with the slow going themselves. But still, the rather saccharine base continues. Most episodes from13 to 23 are amusing, a couple feel like filler that could have been easily skipped.

A note to those who crave a more intense storyline; you'll probably be tempted to give up after the first six or so episodes. But if you persevere until episode 24, congratulations! You are about to be rewarded.

Throughout the series, Tohru's soothing of the Sohma's fate and ruffled feathers is fairly effortless on her part.  Just Tohru being herself is all they need to start breaking out of their self-imposed exile, to start feeling `human' again. She becomes completely entwined with the people she has grown to love and the family she is now a part of (filios).  But the tone shifts during episode 24 as storm clouds gather, literally and figuratively.  Tohru must face a horrific secret that the Sohma's have kept from her. Overcoming this will require not merely doing what comes naturally, but an exhaustive effort that will break her if she fails. Or she can run away, forever losing her new family, as well as that part of herself that is the core of her being.  The drama is exceptionally well played, with Evangelion overtones of what it means and costs to be human, living with and accepting other humans.  For the first time, the outcome is in doubt.  It is a worthy ending to an  `ok' anime.

The music is average; violin, piano, flute and music box stuff that tends toward the fitting and uninspired.  Besides the ending theme, nothing here stands on it's own, but it is better than the mere `background noise' that some shows throw on the soundtrack.  The English vocal dub is excellent (kudos to the Tohru, Kyo and Shigure actors), but the original Japanese voices provide a better feel for the characters, especially Yuki.

Fruits Basket is a fine introduction to anime in general, or the modern `shojo' style in particular. Getting the whole story on four disks makes for a great value.  The message is a good one; be yourself. Be kind, compassionate, and loyal to those who surround you, especially when extraordinary effort is required. You never can tell how much you're needed by those with seemingly impenetrable or uninviting exteriors.",1110153600,136,5940,4.901

1847748,3,B00008H2G4,"OK, there's no denying it, I am attached to Fruits Basket. It is a very sweet, sentimental anime that captures your heart... For a while.

The story? Tohru Honda is a cute, soft-hearted girl who lost her father to an illness (pneumonia, according to the manga) at an early age, and just one year ago, she lost her mother too in a car accident. Not wanting to burden her relatives, she decides to live in a tent in the wilderness and look after herself. But it does not go to plan when a freak landslide destroys her tent and results in her living with her enigmatic classmate Yuki Sohma and his older cousin Shigure Sohma. With the arrival of another Sohma boy, a thorny teen named Kyo; all hell breaks loose when she discovers the Sohma's transform into members of the Chinese Zodiac whenever embraced by a member of the opposite sex!

As the story progresses, and more members of the Chinese Zodiac appear, (schizophrenic cow Haru, angsty doctor and part-time dragon Hatori, weak-hearted tiger Kisa...) Tohru discovers that the life of the Zodiac ain't all peaches-and-cream, and this results in more than a few clashes of personality. However, Tohru's continues to turn to her late mother's advice, and it helps her form new bonds and make new friends, and it begins look like a rice ball really can belong in a Fruits Basket after all! (You'll see what I mean...)

Sounds like fluff? Perhaps. But Fruits Basket really is taught and emotional, bringing out very human weaknesses in its characters. In fact, it brings out TOO MANY human weaknesses in its characters, and that, I'm sorry to say, is what beats this promising anime down.

The main character Tohru, tries to stay cheerful and happy in the face of her mother's death, but what starts off as a grieving child soon develops into something of an obsessive mother-complex. Tohru constantly longs for her mother's help and advice, and is always tied to her photograph. You could argue that it's because Tohru only ever had her mother to guide her, but watching a girl who, when her friend Kyo needs her desperately, can do nothing but drag her angst-ridden body through the rain and clutch at her mother's grave, wailing in self-pity, may make you squirm in discomfort. It's true that Tohru eventually pulls through, but only barely. Another quibble I had with her was her unbearably sexist role in the Sohma house. She does all the cooking, cleaning and shopping, and she's not only good at it, she ENJOYS it. And to make matters worse, the entire Sohma family love her for it, and don't bother to help. Even with Japanese gender politics aside, there's no excusing the fact that they let a girl who's living in their house do all the domestic service for free, and spend her wages from another, paying job on buying chocolates for them. It carries an unpleasant undertone, one that says ""go on girls, return to domestic servitude where you belong, all the guys will love you for it!"" Sure, it may not be as bad as a 1950s commercial, but it's enough to put me off the main characters.

Then we have Tohru's prospective love-interests - not that she notices them - Kyo (the cat - yes there is a cat too) and Yuki (the rat), who are about as opposite as would be expected. Yuki is soft-spoken and gentle, but he shies away from close relationships due to abuse in his past. Kyo is foul-mouthed and violent, but people are drawn to his OTT personality and he can function as a ""normal person"". They both got on my nerves. Yuki's unnatural swinging between self-pity and self-satisfaction, along with his role as the stereotypical ""perfect pupil"" may make viewers unsympathetic to his apparent plight. Kyo, who really gets the spotlight at the end, has certainly received more than his fair share of suffering, but that doesn't excuse his downright abusive behavior towards others. Rather than ""accepting Kyo for who he is"", I think the writers should have focused more on getting Kyo to be a nicer person. Neither of them get together with Tohru in the end, and at the rate this anime was going, it's unlikely the viewers will care.

The other characters all follow the same pattern. They have frustratingly difficult personalities, and most of them have suffered in their past. But once again, this doesn't excuse their actions. They really are difficult for the sake of being difficult. Some characters are a little TOO similar, Aya (the snake) and Ritsu (the monkey) for example. Despite their opposite personalities, both are long-haired, effeminate men with some serious gender-identity issues, and they both have unbelievable levels of self-pity due to problems in their past, which, once again, do not excuse their present behavior.

Other side characters also disturbed me. Momiji's mother and Hatori's ex-fianc Kana mostly. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that a woman would have a mental breakdown and reject her child just because he turns into a rabbit. People in real life suffer so much more than that, yet these characters are apparently so weak hearted that they cannot handle their problems. Kana was so convinced that she caused Hatori's injury (even though she clearly saw Akito strike him across the face with an ornament) that she too broke down into madness. It's not only unrealistic; it's a lame plot device to create new and inventive ways for the male cast to suffer. One of the few bearable characters was Shigure, who has no problems in his past, he is kind and he's actually funny. Of course, in the manga, the author Natsuki Takaya found something for him to angst about as well, *sigh*.....

I could go on and on, but that won't change the fact that I continue to read and watch Fruits basket, and it is by no means a bad anime. My advice? Take the cuteness, take the comedy, take the uplifting subject matter, and leave the choppy animation and liberal amounts of human angst. It's moronic, it's self-indulgent, and it completely ruins an otherwise good anime.

3/5. Add another star if you like exagerrated angst or are willing to overlook the sexism.

Advantages - Carries the uplifting message that kindness and empathy can heal the suffering of others
- Inventive, original character designs
- The music suits the mood of the anime
- Excellent English and Japanese voice-acting

Disadvantages - Unpleasant sexist undertones
- Main characters WILL get annoying
- Last two episodes plummet into ridiculous, cheesy melodrama
- The episodes and formulaic (People arrive, people are difficult, Tohru makes a speech to klinky music and the credits roll)
- The ANGST

Another great thing about this set is the anime and music. I was very pleased with this storyline because it's really different from what I normally see, not just in anime but books in general.

It was going to be a breath of fresh air, or so I thought. The first few episodes were great, very mysterious. But as I reached the half way point, things got dry, really dry.

The shows became very predictable- a little bad thing would happen and Tohru saves the day. I felt like I was back in psychology class again with all the narriating of Tohru's thoughts. After awhile, the main character began to get on my nerves with her lack of personality. She was always happy happy joy joy. There were also cross-dressing men which can be fun, but there are so many in this show, they became annoying too.

What was the biggest disappointment, though, was the lack of the director's creativity with the Sohma's curse. I thought there would be a huge crazy spiel with the Sohma's changing into their zodiac animals all over the place in public. I also thought they would take advantage of their ability to change into an animal more often. At the beginning, it looked like the Sohma's could communicate or control their zodiac animals, but it turns out the animals just follow them. Even that aspect wasn't even taken well advantage of in the show! Unfortunately for me, I have some creativity, and the show did not come even close to its full potential of crazines.

And the ending, don't even get me started on that.

I suggest you stay away from this series if you like shows that aren't predictable. I was able to predict what would happen next just like in Pokemon. This show was a major letdown for me.",1106697600,15,1663,4.514950166112957
1847751,5,B00008H2G4,"The series finally ends here! This is the most dramatic out of the 4 Fruits Basket DVDs. During these episodes, you learn a lot more about Ayame, Matoko, Kyo, Akito and another new character, Kyo's martial arts teacher. Also, you get to meet the last two members of the zodiac, Hiro the ram and Ritsu the monkey. The whole happy-go-lucky story changes to a heart-stopping drama when the last four episodes reveal why Kyo always wears the black and white beads around his wrist. And also, why Akito is so dang evil. I personally think this has to be the best of the whole Fruits Basket series.",1106438400,3,592,4.542056074766355

Maybe the reason I loved this dvd set it because I love comedy, romance and drama, and this story has it all.",1106352000,5,532,3.7168141592920354
1847753,5,B00008H2G4,"I'm really surprised there aren't more reviews for Fruits Basket, and I highly suspect that it's because the title is vague and possibly misleading to a lot of people.  So to any skeptics out there, I say give FB a chance and you'll find out what the title means in detail.  Aside from that, you'll laugh til you cry (I did anyway), and you might just cry until you feel sick.  Fruits Basket runs a gambit of emotions and still comes across as surprisingly realistic.  Speaking for myself, I was able to sympathize with all of the characters at one point or another, even the ""Prince Yuki Fan Club"" girls, though most of the time I would have been happy to strangle each one of them.  (If you're wondering why I said that, you'll have to watch the show.  ~_^)

FB's animation is really beautiful, the characters are all interesting and lovable in their own special ways, and speaking as a fan of the English version by Funimation, the dub is fantastic.  There's a little bit of everything in this anime, and fans of happy endings will find Fruits Basket worth every penny.  And so, in closing I'll say this: the last 3 episodes will hit you like a freight train, and if you're anything like me, you'll definitely be left wanting more.  Enjoy!  ^_^",1104969600,9,1247,4.497777777777777
1847754,5,B00008H2G4,"At first I was skeptical about watching a anime called Fruits Basket. I did a little research and decided to give it a try. I am sure glad that I did. I thought that this was perhaps the best anime that i have ever seen, and I have seen alot of anime. I loved the characters that appeared through each of the episodes. Each one had a problem that they needed to work through, it wasn't all fun and games. I think you go through all the human emotions when you watch this one..but don't worry there is comedy and some fighting for all you guys out there...The only thing that I did not like is that there are not more episodes.",1104796800,4,626,4.139344262295082
1847755,5,B00008H2G4,"What a series this is.  When I first bought the box set, I had mixed feelings.  I thought that the price was not worth it.  Well was I wrong.  This is a wonderful series.  The opening theme song grabs you by being calm and not fast paced like most shows are.  The story is simple but gets complex as it goes on.  Every character is unique in his or her own way.  Tohru Honda is a young girl of sixteen and she recently lost her mother who died in a car accident.  Tohru meets the Soma family with a great and funny secret.  I don't like to give away spoilers of any kind.  Content wise this is more of an a adult show.  It does not have sex, graphic violence, but it deals with issues such as questioning one's gender and sexuality which are topics that are covered often in anime and not in santized shows that we have here.  This show can get intense at times, with character development.  I prefer the Japanese version over the English since the Japanese have a great knack for capturing the drama and mature conversation that english censor with bad jokes and stupid useless comments.  They also swear more in Japanese.  Overall this 26 episode series will make you feel inspired, happy and cheer you up from a bad day.  You just got to see it for yourself.  By the way fruits basket is 13+.  It is worth every penny.  This show will stay with you forever.",1104710400,4,1360,4.2795275590551185
1847756,5,B00008H2G4,"Up until a year ago, I've never seen a single episode of Fruits Basket. After reading so many positive reviews and I decided to rent it from rentanime.com and I must say I was totally blown away. The animation and the story are excellent and the voice acting from both the English and Japanese VA's are exceptional. I was planning on purchasing the entire 4 volumes, but when I heard Funimation was releasing a boxset, I immediately had to get it.  The box itself is gorgeous, with various pictures of the Sohmas, Tohru and her two friends, Ansa Uotani and Saki Hanajima throughout the box. Inside, there's a huge picture of Tohru with almost all the Sohmas in their animal forms. Kyo is eepecially funny in his cat form.

This boxset is a must have for all fans and at the low price of $79.98, you save over $24.00. Instead of buying the entire 4 volume DVD individually. So what are you waiting for, go and get it!!!",1104451200,3,918,4.458333333333333
1847767,5,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket is one of the best anime series to come along in a long time, and it helps that it goes over well with both girls and guys.
Combining comedy, drama, a little romance, and a slight darker edge, Fruits Basket becomes an instant favourite for all those that watch it. The characters are endearing and the story deals mainly with interacting with others and overcoming hardships in order to move forward in life.
If you haven't watched Fruits Basket yet, this is a must-see! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel as if you really got something out of watching it, and the DVD release was magnificiently done....what more can you ask for in an anime?",1103673600,,659,4.641025641025641
1847768,5,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket stands out among all the fluff in anime today, but it definitely requires a bit of patience to discover the deep emotions and meanings hidden among the seemingly ordinary, even derivative, storyline. After watching almost all episodes of this series, I can say without a doubt that it's one of the best anime, much better than Ranma (shallow fluff), even better than His and Her Circumstances (very good show, but a bit too self-indulgent and over-the-top compared to FB).

Beneath the seeming cheerfulness and wackiness of the characters, there's a touchingly sad and dark undertone which made this show so different from all others. Almost every character in this show (including especially Honda Tohru, the heroine) has a sad past which haunts him/her, and which he/she alone probably would never be able to bear, but through friendship and kindness to others, one can learn to live with the sadness of the past. The beautiful opening song encapsulates the theme of the show well:

...

Waiting with patience for the Spring

When the flowers will bloom renewed again

Knowing there's more beyond the pain of today

Although the scars of yesterday remain

You can go on living as much as your heart believes

You can't be born again, although you can change

Let's stay together, always.

...

If you're tired of all the fluff in anime today, you should definitely give Fruits Basket a try, and again be patient and watch at least all the episodes in the first DVD. I'm sure most will find FB to be a treasure, a breath a fresh air.",1102550400,5,1548,4.7819548872180455
1847769,5,B00008H2G4,"Yeah! Fruits Basket is one of the BEST anime I have ever seen (that's saying alot). It's about a girl Toru Honda who has discovered the Soma family's deepest secret. When hugged by a member of the opposite gender they change into one of the animals of the zodiac. It also tells how Toru survives all the hardships that have befallen her, and all the great times Yuki, Kyo, everyone had together. It is very funny and it's all for a GREAT price. I think the best part is that it's really believable. It really seems like it could happen. I promise you won't regret ever having watch it. What are you waiting for??? Go buy it already ;)

Also, if you've read the manga before and have never seen this, be warned that this anime stops VERY early.",1101340800,2,743,4.345323741007194
1847770,5,B00008H2G4,"I would have to say that this was one of my most favorite anime. It was different, refreshing. The series were great, it brings out a lot of people. And any one can connect to this. Because you can also relate to many of the characters in the story. It a sweet romantic anime story...but too bad we may never know the real ending except through reading the manga. Why, because the director of the series felt that when he was making it, everything was too rushed because of the deadline, and that people were overworked and were exhausted. This director is well- known for when he is finished with a work and has not been working on it... the chances of him making a second season for this anime is very doubtful. This anime was made back, I think it was in 2001 or 2002 in japan and it have been a few years now. So I guess the only thing that you can do to find out the ending is to read the manga.",1101254400,4,900,4.119318181818182

The only thing that bother me somehow is the lack of extra stuffs in these DVDs everything is great,the quality of sound & picture but it can be better. X.X

This is a great series that shows that being innocence is maybe the greatest gift that you have, and simply understanding how people think and feel your greatest accomplishment. Fruit Basket shows so pretty hard times for the Soma family but it also shows how people can triumph over adversity and their hardships. This is a really romance series, not because there's a lot of kissing and stuff like that. But that you can really see the romantic natures that exist in some of the most unlikely characters. I wish that the ending of DVD four came to more of an conclusion like who the main female character ends up with, and not to mention that not all the members of the Chinese zodiac appeared so hopefully that means there is more DVDs on there way.",1098662400,3,815,4.44

1847775,5,B00008H2G4,"Fruits Basket is quite an interesting anime, at first the show seems to over the top, and can turn off potential viewers with the giant eyes and the crazy fan club girls,  but on episode two the show really kicks off, and with the introduction of new characters, each of whom are unique and different in their own way and devolop quite a bit over the course of the series, the show becomes even funnier, as a note Fruits Basket has an amazing dub, for those who like dubs, in fact, most of the time I watch this series dubbed.
As a note I consider the Fruits Basket DVDs to be really the first truely amazingly done DVDS, at the time (Or at least to my knowledge) most Anime discs had 2-5 episodes and th only features were textless endings (Can you say crappy and boring?) but Fruits basket has not only previews for other Funimation stuff, but interviews, a documentary of the ""eye catches"" (Which are explained in the documentry) and even behind the scenes footage. AND 6 episodes per disc, and the disc has 3 regions, any fan of special features would freak out, why the only way they could get any better would be is if it came with a poster or something rather.
Overall I suguest Fruits Basket to anyone who is willing to give it a chance, the anime has elements from many genres and is a perfect balance of Comedy and Character devolopment.

A beautiful but in some ways an incomplete ending. Yet... i'm thankful that it's 'incomplete'. Fruits Basket is a lot more meaningful than one may expect. Sure it's goofy, and silly, but there are those moments where some of life's greatest lessons, and the better sides of humanity shine through. Ofcourse, where there's a display of positive human qualities, there is also a display of the not so pretty ones...
I got a lot more out of Fruits Baskets than I would have expected. Tohru is definitely one of the most self-less characters ever created, I don't believe there's been one more noble than her. It's beautiful how her existence means so much to so many people, and all the positive influence she has over the people around her. I truly look up to Tohru and I promise I'll try to see the fruit on my back more :).
For those who are interested, I do believe the manga is 11 volumes long? or was it 13... you can always check Tokyopop out :). I'm pretty pleased with the conclusion though... had they made Tohru choose... it would have upsetted me. Through the series I've grown attached to both Yuki and Kyo, to have Tohru choose one over the other would make me sad either way :). Still... it's one of the greatest things I've ever seen and I treasure all the things it's taught me.",1078790400,4,1359,4.44

The final three episodes are grim, dark, suspenseful and emotionally powerful, as once again, Tohru must confront the fact that parts of the Sohma curse--and family--are not at all adorable.  And this time, rising to the occasion to offer comfort and encouragement might even be beyond the abilities of Tohru.  Kyo's horrific darkest secret is revealed, and Akito finally finishes playing with Tohru, and makes his move to destroy her spirit utterly, and plunge his family back into the condition of unresisting despair which is their true curse.
