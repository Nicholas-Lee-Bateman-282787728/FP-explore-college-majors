8081132,5,B000AYYO9Y,A simple love story. Two lovers ultimately triumph over a world against them. Beautiful story! Angelica Houston is ravishing! I highly recommend this film. Anthony Corlan (Higgins) is superb as is Assaf Dayan.,1495756800,,209,5.363636363636363
8081133,4,B000AYYO9Y,I like the movie that was Anjelica Huston's first movie. Nice to find a copy. Keep up the good work,1401062400,,99,4.0
8081134,4,B000AYYO9Y,"A rare look at the young Anjelica Huston and her work. A raw look at the Middle Ages, with settings and theme music that should soothe and please the heart of any fan of the era.",1381104000,3,178,3.9722222222222223
8081135,1,B000AYYO9Y,"Well, after continual complaints from film fans over the past few years, it seems the morons who run the home video division at Fox either are incompetent, or even worse, contemptuous and just ignore their demands that their widescreen films being released in their ""Cinema Classics"" series get released on dvd in their CORRECT WIDESCREEN FORMAT.

Yet here with A Walk With Love And Death being a new release (on July 13, 2013), once again Fox has thrown out a 1:85 widescreen film in a full frame 1:33 format.

I strongly urge all film fans to avoid this U.S. release (especially at the exorbitant list price of $20!) and if they really want it in their collections to seek out the U.K. region 2 BFI release which has a restored version of the film in it's proper widescreen format. Even with a higher shipping cost from the UK it's still a few dollars cheaper than this insulting U.S. release.",1380240000,17,895,4.622641509433962
8081136,2,B000AYYO9Y,"Rarely seen nowaday , this movie could be considered as a study of class relations in the Middle Ages between the Nobles, the Church and the rest of the Nation. If you're not interested in these matters, you could possibly like the main plot describing a love story between a scholar and a noble damsel trying to survive and find happiness in the middle of a civil war. For my part, A Walk with Love and Death is already forgotten. Unfortunately.",1329955200,3,446,4.518518518518518
8081137,4,B000AYYO9Y,"During the Hundred Years War (1337-1453) between France and England, a young student (Assaf Dayan) and a young noblewoman (17 year old Anjelica Huston, still a novice at acting but looking quite lovely) attempt to escape the slaughter by fleeing to the sea and, hopefully, a ship to freedom. Along the way, they find destruction, vengeance, cruelty even from the Church itself while keeping their love alive. While absolutely an anti-war film, the director John Huston doesn't preach to us the insanity of war, he shows us. As these two young lovers, almost still children, walk through the nightmarish existence and images of carnage and havoc, your heart breaks for them realizing it's only a matter of time before they become victims of its apocalypse. The acting is rather primitive (contemporary reviews were particularly unkind to Ms. Huston) but this isn't a film where acting is all that important. Huston's direction keeps the storyline compelling enough to hold our interest. The virile cinematography is by Edward Scaife (DIRTY DOZEN) and there's an eloquent score by Georges Delerue to accompany it. With John Huston as Anjelica's uncle, Michael Gough, Robert Lang and Anthony Higgins.

The MC-One DVD via Germany is an above average anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer with the soundtrack in either English or German. I can't speak for the Spanish version (which I hear is poor) or the British DVD (which I hear is quite nice).",1325808000,11,1443,5.0886075949367084
