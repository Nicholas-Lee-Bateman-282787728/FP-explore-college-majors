4237294,5,B003ZZ7TPG,"Okay, I watched this when it came on the Syfy Channel for the first time earlier this year. When I watched it I thought it was pretty good for a made-for TV movie. I borrowed it from my friend on the Unrated DVD and watched it again. I am now confident with my decision that Lake Placid 3 is much better than Lake Placid 2. Still, it is nowhere near as good as the first one. Now that I've said that, here's the breakdown.

1.  Directing--This was a well shot film. Nice directing from G.E. Furst even though this was his first film.
2.  Script--Well done writing by David Reed. This was his first movie script and it was pretty good. Some bad dialogue here and there but not too bad.
3.  Acting--Well good acting. I like this performance from Colin Ferguson the most. And of course let's not forget the legendary Michael Ironside who is always good. Also notable is the very pretty young actress Kacey Barnfeild who plays Ellie in the movie.

Now for the content review.
Rated R for bloody creature violence/UNRATED

1.  Sex/Nudity=8/10. There are three scenes of nudity, one incuding a brief full-frontal shot. Worse than the first two.
2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. I personally thought that this was more violent than the second one. There is not a ton of bloodshed, but there's enough. Nicely done decapitation.
3.  Language=3/10. There are a few mild profanities in it because it's a TV film. Nothing too bad.

OVERALL---5/5 Rating. I liked this movie. Very nicely done Syfy Original Film. Let's hope for Lake Placid 4 sometime in the future.",1292889600,15,1542,4.656826568265683
4237295,1,B003ZZ7TPG,"A dilemma: 'Lake Placid 3' is a pretty bloody stupid film, with awful acting and risible special effects, but, and it's a MASSIVE but, it contains full-frontal views of divine, rampant Roxanne 'Jo Stiles' Pallett.
(Colonial readers probably won't know who Jo, sorry, Roxanne, is: she was extraordinarily hot in a prime-time British soap called 'Emmerdale' with Amanda Donohoe, Patrick Mower and Freddie Jones (!). She left last year to pursue a career in Tinsletown like so many of her peers. She'll be back in 'Emmerdale' shortly, but for now, brilliantly, we have the dvd of 'LP3' to treasure and remind us of her brave stab at the big time.)

Simmering Jo, sorry, Roxanne, takes just a few short minutes to shuck down and head for the water. Cue totally gratuitous shots of her splashing around, and then, er, splashing around a bit more. She then has porn-style sex with her grinning simpleton boyfriend before dying horribly (Did I mention Jo, sorry, Roxanne, is only in the film for the first five minutes ? No ? It matters not). Reassuringly, 'LP3' follows the tried and trusted b-flick formula: sex = death. When everyone's dead, introduce more sex. When the audience is bored to death, introduce more sex. The never-ending, spiraling vortex that exploitation and b has sadly become.

The remainder of 'LP3' is a soggy disaster. SFX I could do better on my lappy, acting that reminded me strangely of metal fatigue and a work-shy, one-thread script which makes Ed Wood seem like Harold Pinter.
Apart from Jo, sorry, Roxanne, the only other familiar face is Michael Ironside, who is old and fat and just grunts around in a boat. Even in his current shambolic form, he recognizes instinctively he's in (another ?) turkey and cuts his cloth accordingly.

The rest is pure wind on the waves. Jo, sorry, Roxanne, should've drafted in a few of her soap pals to do some rewrites ~ she probably could've had a better go herself. There's only so much ogling of Jo, sorry, Roxanne, and chortling at risible SFX you can do in a short lifetime (sacrilege, I do know ). There's even a sex-pervert who is is no fun at all - and how likely is that ?
I cheered when a horrid ginger dog got snapped up, but apart from Jo, sorry, Roxanne, that was about it.

Now, the dilemma. 'LP3' is a one-star film in pretty much every respect, yet any movie that brags a bare Jo, sorry, Roxanne Pallett (and I need to be fair, here. I've been ribbing her in this review, but she's quite good in her small role, her American accent isn't bad ~ and bod-wise, she is absolutely breath-taking !), deserves to be a straight fiver without any discussion. To give it four would suggest it had some worth, two would suggest a slightly noble failure and three is always a cop-out.
But I feel I'd better stick with the desperate one star, which on the whole, 'LP3' richly deserves. Where would we be if we started raving about awful movies, just because we're drooling over a participant (perfect example: 'LP1' ~ sexual ariel-angel Meredith Salenger is in that one ~ ooh, 5 stars. Yes, but she keeps her clothes on ~ ooh, back down to 1 ).
No, poor Jo, sorry, Roxanne, will just have to lump it. Remember, this time last year she was getting beaten black and blue by ugly, hopeless nutter Andy Sugden, and this time next year, she'll be back for more.
Karma has a nasty habit of delivering a sharp size ten to the gluteous maximus of those who get fancy ideas about the Arts, and it doesn't care if said gluteous maximus is perfect or not. I'm not going to stand here and do nothing....",1292284800,2,3555,4.576138147566719
4237296,2,B003ZZ7TPG,"What a steaming pile of Crocodile doo this is. If I would have looked it up before I spent my $1.00 at the rent box I would have passed on it. But I get to the rent box and this hobo is talking to him self, blowing cigarette smoke down his blouse and turning slowly in circles so I am sure to see he has a pretty pink skirt on over his black stained up jogging pants. I also note the big jumbo shoe tassels he has made from what may have been bloody rags tied to his shoe strings. Anyway I was in a big hurry to get away from my new buddy so I just picked the first thing I saw on the monitor. If you ever have a doubt about how bad of an actress Yancy Butler is please see this fine film, she is so stunningly lame it is worth a look.
Michael Ironside can be the kiss of death for any movie but trust me he is the highlight of this  flick.
C.G.I. ha ha , you must see it to believe it. I had fun just pointing and mocking this movie from start to end.",1290988800,,952,3.736318407960199
4237297,4,B003ZZ7TPG,THIS MOVIE IS OK FOR THE ACTION BUT ITS A BLOODY NIGHTMARE  EVERY WHERE U LOOK SOMEONE IS BEING EATEN BY CROCODILES. THESE THINGS EAT EVERYTHING ANMIALS TO PEOPLE. THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE ONE LADY HUNTER THAT TALKS WAY TO MUCH. WHERE IS BETTY WHITE SHE MADE LAKE PLACID. OK THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PART OF THIA MOVIE.

4237298,4,B003ZZ7TPG,"Try not to think to hard about the impossibilities of cold blooded pre-historic crocodiles not having to bask long hours in the sun. Don't think about the young boy who has fed these same crocs for TWO years without anyone noticing any crocodiles anywhere. Nor think about the giant crocs knowledge of household layouts  or their ability to quickly move and navigate through dense woods. The monster size crocs look like they are made of rubber.

The movie has a couple with a son move into a home when grandma dies. Grandma kept a chainsaw in the refrigerator. On the first day, the son finds the crocs and feeds them as pets, careful not to get too close. Unlike adults, boats, and automobiles, the crocs don't attack him. Dad is a wildlife ranger and mom is a Realtor. There is a sheriff who claims there are no crocs. The lake has been searched with sonar. The are four college kids out camping/ swimming on the lake. There is also a woman who is a guide for poaching elk who takes out a party which include one college kid searching for his girlfriend who is part of the said four. The story is simple. You could probably guess most of it by now and the only real question is who lives and who dies. The movie includes the standard 1980's three gratuitous nude scenes, including one early full frontal in the unrated version. One sex scene. PLOT SPOILER: The babysitter keeps her clothes on.",1288396800,13,1396,4.513833992094861
4237299,1,B003ZZ7TPG,"This a very cheap made movie. The plot and the acting are terrible. The special effects of the crocodiles are so bad and look so fake, they do not look scary. There's no suspense. The only worthful thing to watch is that the girls are damn hot. Thankfully I rented it for one dollar at the Redbox.",1288224000,2,297,4.228070175438597
4237300,3,B003ZZ7TPG,"Lake Placid was a fun, humorous film when it was released in 1999. It was followed in 2005 by the made-for-TV Lake Placid 2, which starred John Schneider and Cloris Leachman. It was entertaining, but it didn't really compare to the first.

Now, Lake Placid 3 surfaces and it fares about the same as the second entry. The special effects are about what you would expect from a Sci-Fi channel film. The storyline is actually fairly good, however. It involves the grandson of Leachman from the 2nd film, played by Eureka star Colin Ferguson, and his attempts to kill the crocodiles after it begins to kill off the elk population in his quiet Maine town. Along for the ride are Yancy Buter (of Witchblade) and the great Michael Ironside (as the rough and tough sheriff.)

It's not a bad film. It is sure entertaining and it is a fun way to kill a couple of hours if you have nothing else to do.",1284249600,28,890,4.45398773006135

The little boy is in serious need of some punishment, the housekeeper was stupid, most of the guys talk badly to the wemon, most of the wemon (except 1) are unrealistically stupid and clueless and constantly need saving like they are helpless, the one guy is a pervert, the boyfriend stalked his girlfriend into the woods, and if I have to hear his shout ""ELLIE"" one more time I'm going to kill someone. I wish I didn't have to give this movie any stars. It has no story just pointless gore, overly rude and perverted men, wemon are helpless or naked at all times, and the alligators look awful.

Colin Ferguson (Nathan) is bitten by a croc on his arm and all he has is a bandage - arm recovers fully. Croc would of taken his arm off with ease and chewed up the woman. AND Jordon Grehs who plays the son is TERRIBLE. He comes on and I just fast forward. Wouldn't be surprised if he was family to head of casting.

4237378,3,B003ZZ7TPG,"Pretty entertaining stuff, so, too, these comments, in similar spirit, intend to be a ramble that diverts and gladdens the reader rather than merely opt to be an excessively longfaced and serious assessment of the movie! ""Crocodiles in Maine?!?"", you may be asking yourself, members of the species which somehow, apparently (but unexplainedly), are winter-proofed, at that, and yet which remain excitingly vicious, too! I love to see one of them devour Teddy, the baby sitter`s obnoxiously yappy li`l lap dawg! Many of these beasts go on to tuck into nourishing repasts which these fearsome critters make also of some lovely ladies and of an overweight sheriff, among other victims, all of which humans make mighty fine crocodile fodder!

Then there is zealous and amourously entertaining Brett, among the characters of the film, as the young Welsh actor, Mark Evans, depicts him. Evans, so far (as of Oct. 2012) has had a paltry cinema career apart from ""Lake Placid: 3"", but he provides one of the movie`s highlights when, overcome with joy and desire, he delivers a stunningly prize-winningly, passionately full-jaws-binding (and noses-fusing) kiss (almost as carnivorous, in its life-affirming manner, as those crocodiles are, alas, in their own, death-dealing way of using their own jaws!) to his lucky screen girl friend, Ellie (played by Kacey Barnfield) which is, indisputably, of world-class, record-setting fervour worthy of a roaring standing ovation! What a shame it truly is (and such a loss to womankind!) that a crocodile devours Brett within so few moments after that extraordinary face-to-face buss with the lower frontal and sidelong portion of Ellie`s head!

My, oh, my! how that Welshman can kiss and woo!
Wow! ah, wow! how those crocs can bite and chew!

(Be it noted, in fact and even less romantically, that Crocodiles do not ""chew"" in the usual sense, but rather that their jaws and teeth bite, crush, and sever, then they gulp down big chunks of any prey too large, like an human teenager or adult, to swallow whole. However, ""chew"" provides a convenient and nifty rhyme, doesn`t it?)

Let`s all hope that a truly enterprising studio eventually will transform a sizzling and funny farce, ""Crocodile Khader"", which a writer already has conceived in his imagination, into a screenplay for a movie. It is the tale of two variously friendly then battling crocodiles, Khader and Khufir, who have come to the Aibitibi to frequent Lake Osisko and the surrounding environs.

In Egypt the two reptiles, Khader being good-natured, Khufir (a.k.a. Kafir) being evil and sadistic, had been pals, sharing the Egyptian Crocodile Community`s awards as distinguished, prize-winning ""Eager Eaters"". There they had lived in and upon the shores of the Nile River, before by various means and at different times they have come to dwell in the Abitibi region of Qubec. In their crackling, crocodilian Arabic-tinged accents, both of them can cackle and grunt in French and English. Khufir himself notably has dined upon his own canine repast, having devoured Fluffy the Poodle, who had been functioning as watch-dawg at a local Chinese eatery. Khufir has not only has digested Fluffy, but he also has replaced that hound as the restaurant`s night guardian.

In that tale of the byways of displaced reptiles in the Abitibi, there is a terrific massacre, a dreadful instance of Death-by-Crododile, wherein Crocodile Khufir, the evil one of the two reptiles, kills and devours many of the children at the annual Christmas party which His Worship, the Mayor, hosts at the local City Hall. Crocodile Khader, on the other hand, loves and protects human children. So, Khader, who is the smaller of the pair but who has the advantage of being bionic, slays Khufir, the bigger croc, in an epic confrontation. Both crocodiles had arrived at the event decked out elegantly in Santa Claus costumes.

At any rate, the improbabilities of the multi-film ""Lake Placid"" crocodiles saga are perhaps only relatively less credible (some even may say, unkindly, only marginally less believable) than what are the unlikely elements in the Abitibian epic-in-the-making. One hopes that the Crocodiles Khader and Khufir get the posher animatronic, more solidly physical, and vividly cinematic effects of ""Lake Placid: [1]"" in re-creating the saga of that pair of reptiles, rather than the cheaper computer effects that the crocodiles in ""Lake Placid: 3"" received with such visually as well as budgetarily parsimonious results. (Hint for real crocodile and wildlife fanciers: for a comedic action film which uses live and genuinely dangerous crocodiles, to far more thrilling effect rather either than animatronic contraptions or than computer generated imagery could equal, see, despite all his goofiness in acting, how Steve Irwin handles these perillous creatures, and several other deadly species, too, in the movie, ""The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course"" with the fascinating extra features of the ""Special Edition"" DVD, Metro-Goldwin Mayer Home Entertainment 4007668.)

Despite all the implausibilies afoot in the impending final film of the series set in Maine, I hardly can wait for ""Lake Placid, the Final Chapter""! Can you? Perhaps Crocodile Khader, surviving back in the Abitibi, will be in the audience, if he really exist, to watch (and maybe to protest) it!",1348531200,,5349,5.226107226107226

This movie is so stupid I don't know where to start. Everyone in it acts as stupid as possible, I ask can people really be that stupid? The answer is yes! Anyone who thinks this movie is worth watching fits into that category. What is the world coming to? The best part of this movie was it finally ended. They should make DVD's recyclable so I don't feel so bad when I throw it away because I certainly won't dump this piece of crap onto anyone else.",1345334400,,664,4.155038759689923
4237380,4,B003ZZ7TPG,"Try not to think to hard about the impossibilities of cold blooded prehistoric crocodiles not having to bask long hours in the sun. Don't think about the young boy who has fed these same crocs for TWO years without anyone noticing any crocodiles anywhere. Nor think about the giant crocs knowledge of household layouts or their ability to quickly move and navigate through dense woods. The monster size crocs look like they are made of rubber.

The movie has a couple with a son move into a home when grandma dies. Grandma kept a chainsaw in the refrigerator. On the first day, the son finds the crocs and feeds them as pets, careful not to get too close. Unlike adults, boats, and automobiles, the crocs don't attack him. Dad is a wildlife ranger and mom is a Realtor. There is a sheriff who claims there are no crocs. The lake has been searched with sonar. The are four college kids out camping/ swimming on the lake. There is also a woman who is a guide for poaching elk who takes out a party which include one college kid searching for his girlfriend who is part of the said four. The story is simple. You could probably guess most of it by now and the only real question is who lives and who dies.

The movie includes the standard 1980's three gratuitous nude scenes, including one early full frontal in the unrated version. One sex scene. PLOT SPOILER: The babysitter keeps her clothes on.",1340755200,,1395,4.509881422924901
4237381,2,B003ZZ7TPG,"The first two films in the ""Lake Placid"" series featured Betty White and Cloris Leachman, which made them first-rate high camp. Unfortunately, there are no octogenarian crocodile aficionados here to flesh out the cast and provide humorous comic relief. ""Lake Placid 3"" comes across as a much more routine giant aquatic creature gone wild movie from the folks at Syfy. If you are into creature features played straight against terrible CGI, this is a great choice; if you were hoping for a more tongue-in-cheek approach, this may be disappointing. The film opens with Syfy regular Velizar Binev as Dimitri, a grocery store owner with anger management issues giving two teens a ride into the woods. The girl is extremely cute, but unfortunately she doesn't stick around long due to a bad case of crocodylus interruptus.

After a rapid progression of flashbacks, we meet the protagonists, Nathan and Susan Bickerman (Colin Ferguson and Kirsty Mitchell) and their insufferable son Connor (Jordan Grehs) who are now vacationing in the cabin on the lake which comes fully furnished with a chainsaw in the refrigerator. Nathan is a geeky EPA zoologist, Susan is an abhorrent Realtor, and Connor is the idiot who steals roasts from Dimitri's store to feed the crocodiles, because he's really smart. Michael Ironside is the best actor present playing Sheriff Willinger, a no nonsense kind of guy who denies the existence of crocs in the lake. Absolutely terrible dialogue plagues the film throughout: for example, after Connor is caught shoplifting, his horrible absentee mother says ""Did I eat too much chili when he was in my womb?"" Later, despite being 100% to blame for the mess, Connor tries to pin everything on his parents with ""I thought it was a rule of nature that parents took care of their kids!"" (Note to Connor: frequently it's not. Ask your father to explain. After all he's a zoologist.)

I guess there weren't enough characters to make an interesting movie yet, so the film adds another subplot to give more nuance to the production. Four horrible college students are on an outing to the lake, and the least likeable character in the film (well, OK, after Connor, of course) Reba (Yancy Butler,) a poacher and tracker available for hire takes three guys into the rough to poach elk. Two of the three are yokels who just want to kill things, which is also Reba's favorite hobby (her boat is named the ""Carnivore,"" and at one point she actually gets to say ""How many times do you get to shoot a giraffe?"") The third is Brett (Mark Evans,) a hero college student who is employing Reba to track his ex-girlfriend Ellie (Kacey Barnfield, easily the most captivating thing on the screen at any point of the film,) who he believes is having a weekend getaway with the evil Aaron (Nils Hognestad,) a grad student who misled her into breaking up with him. If this sounds quite soap opera-esque, you are right. It's also highly dull. The middle hour of the film devolves into much bogus CGI munching, though it takes way too long for some characters to get gulped down (I'm specifically thinking of the hideous babysitter here.)

Despite the now-obvious giant crocodile infestation, the one thing that they don't do is call 911. Or anyone. Only a couple of people have cell phones, and none of them think of using this handy function. (Remember this was made in 2010. It's all amazingly plausible.) Reba's party is spoiled by the marine predators: this leads to some amazing emoting, and we learn that Reba is also an effective grief counselor. The most entertaining questions are twofold: where does her knife end up, and how fast can she get eaten? You'll have to watch for yourself to find out. There are lots of ferocious battles and a car, a boat oar, and a chainsaw are used in enterprising ways, though I was curious why Reba put down her high powered rifle during the croc charge to duke it out with a two-handed pistol technique of great comedic proportions. Of course I know the answer: because director Griff Furst told her to. Before it's over there is great mayhem, an inexplicable boat catapult stunt, shopping cart violence and ensuing supermarket tragedy, a demonstration of a complete lack of understanding how an emergency exit works (it is not necessary to batter it open with a fire extinguisher; simply pushing the bar is more effective and quicker,) a dissatisfied payphone customer, a gas pump collision, and finally an explosion that might remind the casual viewer of a certain scene in ""Jaws"" in some regards. Finishing it all up is a ludicrous eco-conscious lecture about ""The Maine River Crocodile"" and a finale that begs for another sequel, though I would suggest Syfy look at other underwater perils that are scarier in the future. Giant koi, maybe?

The film only has some previews as extras, but has a bewildering array of audio language and subtitle options: to make sure I didn't miss anything important I watched it a second time in Thai with Portuguese subtitles, which was oddly satisfying. ""Lake Placid 3"" is by no means the worst of the Syfy giant predatory creature films, but neither does it live up to its predecessors in the series. I recommend it to fans of the genre only.",1340496000,3,5215,4.823463687150838

4237387,3,B003ZZ7TPG,"Wow!  What a mixed crocodile bag this is.  It starts out with a bang, literally...in the sexual sense.  That opening scene is sexy, suspenseful, raunchily hilarious, and actually makes you jump in fright.  It's too bad the rest of the movie can't sustain that level of horror fun.  There are two things that do elevate this standard sci-fi horror flick above other time fillers.  One, is Yancy Butler as a tough as nails hunting guide.  She's the only character that's truly likable.  This chick can really take care of herself (and others) whether it be her skill at sexually harassing male waiters or fighting off crocs with nothing but a knife.  Apart from her, though, it is extremely hard not to wince at the stupidity of every other character.  (The one exception is a semi-chubby pervert who's also very likable and funny for the few minutes he's alive, trying to get girls naked before he expectantly becomes just another ingredient in the croc pot).  The stock characters we are given are a Paris Hilton type babysitter with an odd accent who comes complete with requisite poodle, a jerk who wants to get laid, changing clothes in the woods bimbos, standard movie rednecks, a sheriff who doesn't do his job and just denies there are crocs untile he sees them, and worst of all, a boyfriend who got dumped and is trying to find and reconcile with his busty ex girlfriend.  Now that guy's a real tool who needs to be slapped upside the head.  Apart from that, there is a totally ineffective leading man who isn't a pacifist, a manly man, or that smart for a typically lame movie zoologist.  This guy gives no one a run for their money, and oftentimes hides behind locked doors with women and children while he just leaves other characters to bite the dust.  He, along with his workaholic wife, are like many parents today.  They still lead their own lives as if they were not parents, not realizing that their priorities should be in raising and spending time with their child, not just providing for him and leaving him to become a disrepectful little turd.  That child swine steals meat from his parents and the local grocer which he then feeds to lake crocodiles which he thinks are his pals.  Soon, he is unable to provide them with enough vittles, so they start aggressively chomping on people.  The CGI effects work just some of the time.  Most of the time, however, they follow the terrible trend of SyFy CGI and look like badly drawn, see-through cartoons.  I don't know why this trend is happening.  Lately, most of the movies on SyFy seem like they're intentionally being made to be ""so bad they're good"" movies.  That's not how that works, though.  And it's not what audiences want most of the time.  They want fun movies that scare the pants off of you, and make you laugh at how they make you jump.  This one got some things right in the casting of Yancy Butler and some of the gratuitous sexy scenes.  Other than that though, it's hard to praise a film about fake looking crocodiles moving like fake looking crocodiles chasing characters that are just as cartoonish and/or really unlikable.  Somebody's gotta make a movie that bucks the current trend of flaunting creatures that look like bad CGI.  Until then, thank your stars for classics like JAWS, ALLIGATOR, ORCA, JURASSIC PARK, and the original LAKE PLACID that got that part right.",1310515200,,3359,4.674616695059625
4237388,1,B003ZZ7TPG,"In the original Lake Placid (1999), Delores Bickerman (Betty White) was responsible for causing a crocodile to reach larger than normal size, bringing terror to the community around Black Lake, Maine.  The Sy Fy Channel continued the story in Lake Placid 2 (2007), with Delores' sister Sadie (Cloris Leachman) responsible for creating a number of oversized crocs.  The carnage at Black Lake continues in Lake Placid 3 (2010), another Sy Fy Channel Original Movie, that takes the franchise to new lows in stupidity, ineptness, and cowardice.

About a year has passed since Sadie Bickerman became a snack for one of her pet crocs in Lake Placid 2.  Zoologist Nathan Bickerman (Colin Ferguson) is now living in Sadie's cabin, debating with his wife Susan (Kristy Mitchell), whether they should sell the place.  Unknown to his parents, their annoying young son Connor (Jordan Grehs), has taken up tossing raw meat to the crocodiles he has found in the lake, and the ""neglected"" twerp is later busted for shoplifting, trying to procure more meat.

The giant-sized crocs are doing fine, feeding on wildlife and snacking on unsuspecting humans.  While in the woods Bickerman discovers a severed elk head, the remains of a croc kill.  Also present are the obligatory annoying twentysomething campers.  Adding a faint bit of color to the routine drabness is Yancy Butler (who still looks pretty good at 40) as Reba, a wisecracking tour guide, who is out on the lake hauling around a couple of low IQ hunters, and a lovesick college kid (Mark Evans) looking his girlfriend (Kacy Barnfeld), who is among the campers.

Bickerman and Sheriff Willinger (Michael Ironside) are in a boat cruising looking for crocs, when the beasts strike in full force on all fronts, prowling around the Bickerman cabin, chasing after the campers, and ramming both Reba's and the Sheriff's boat.  The rest of the film is totally ridiculous, as the crocs make the most extraordinary efforts to sink their jaws into anything with two legs.

Unless you're a glutton for punishment, there's not much to like about this film.  The few who have the guts to fight the crocs get slaughtered, while others less deserving survive.  As usual, the best part of the film are the kills, but unfortunately the wrong people seem to be dying, which takes away most of the fun.  Almost all of the characters are pathetic, extremely annoying, and amazingly stupid.  Even with the life of his family on the line, Bickerman is particularly unimpressive, leaving a wounded Reba to take on a croc alone, while he hides in the bathroom.  Later Bickerman attacks a door with a fire extinguisher, while the croc tries to devour his family.  Save for a few witty quips here and there, the writing is quite awful.

Hitting a new low, it might be best if this saga came to an end, but with Sy Fy's low standards, this franchise can go on for some time.
