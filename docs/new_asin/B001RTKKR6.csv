8338708,5,B001RTKKR6,"I really enjoyed this movie.  In brief, it relates to an ex-con who is dispossessed on release but, in desperation,  gets a job as cleaner in a gym, run by an aging and broken down ex-boxing champ who trains him to win a title bout. In my opinion the story line is somewhat predictable, if not a little hackneyed, but the performance of Stacy Keach as the trainer is nothing short of outstanding and with a good supporting cast, interest is assured! The focus on boxing training was an excellent reminder of what is necessary to succeed in this ""sport of kings"". Perhaps the ""bad boy opponent"" didn't quite cut the mustard? However, overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1377907200,,666,4.635593220338983
8338709,5,B001RTKKR6,"OK so it helps the hottest man in the world is the star of the movie, but the plot wasn't bad either!  Very inspirational, yet many dull moments!",1365379200,,145,4.178571428571429
8338710,5,B001RTKKR6,"This is a very inspiring and powerful film. The message, that you have to fight for what you want in life, is very true. Plus, if you're a Josh Dallas fan, watch this film. He gives a passionate, inspiring and powerful performance. Probably one of his best. Highly recommended!",1337644800,,277,4.673469387755102
8338711,4,B001RTKKR6,"As in the case of another reviewer, I was interested in this movie because I was impressed by Josh Dallas's recent peformances in ""Once Upon A Time"". I was not disappointed. The boxing in this movie really serves more as a back drop to much larger issues. The main character (JD) is trying to reconnect with family and life in general after serving a prison term for beating up an abusive stepfather (he beat JD's mother); Stacy Keach (a former boxing champ in his own right) takes a shine to JD, employs him in his gym first as a handyman-cleaner and then as his new boxing protege.  The interacton of the two men, the personal problems that they have and are able to overcome are the real linchpins of this film. The boxing is well choreographed without the hyperbolic slugging and training of ""Rocky"" and has a more realistic tinge. A journey of two men who come to terms with  their past, present, future, and each other gives heart to a film that has much more substance than one might expect from the title alone. The presence of a jealous and nasty rival boxer who is hell bent on making life miserable for JD adds just the right balance of ""evil"" to keep the film from being too saccharine while stimulating and motivating the two main characters. In the end, the movie succeeds thanks to the acting and storyline in general because it avoids being a cliche even though it trods familar territory.",1330214400,,1405,4.549407114624506
8338712,3,B001RTKKR6,"I just finished watching the boxer with my wife. I was surprised at the fact she liked this film. I won't ruin the film by telling you in detail what happens. I will tell you that if you love boxing movies this is a pretty decent film. It is low budget and that makes a lot of people tune out. I don't understand why since it still is a good little movie. You don't get awsome effects during the fight scenes, but you do get a good story and that is what this movie is. A good story that doesn't have endless sex and violence. It is a film you can watch with your family and just enjoy. I know my wife enjoyed this film. I have trouble sometimes finding movies that me and my wife can get into. I love horror movies but my wife doesn't. It was a nice change to just enjoy a movie together. So if your looking for a movie to enjoy with your family look no further. If you want sex, violence, and profanity, well then look elsewhere. This is a movie with a good story to tell.",1297641600,3,974,4.025773195876289
8338713,2,B001RTKKR6,"Well I typed this out in detail and just as I entered my first ""tag"" I lost everything. So I don't want to type all this again so take it from me, every scene came out of some other boxing movie (but  as one writer stated definitely not Rocky). I bought it because ""Joe"" (Stacy Keach ) a retired boxer (with a secret) and now gym owner became reluctant Ben's trainer (poor Ben was a reluctant ex-convict who went to jail saving his mother- his secret). Keach was a great actor (in his day). They used every clich used in every cheap movie to evoke emotion and try to create interest in a VERY LOW BUDGET MOVIE.",1270512000,,610,4.213675213675214
8338714,3,B001RTKKR6,"Not sure why Steve (""SLV Video"") is so grouchy about this one.  I'm not tone-deaf, and I liked the music just fine!  It's interesting to see a German production and watch Stacy Keatch in action again... Definitely worth a look.",1244332800,,227,4.65
8338715,3,B001RTKKR6,"Rocky, this is not, and the storyline was pretty predictable. It is though a valiant effort on what I am sure was a very limited budget. I think if the screenplay would have been better would have helped.
 I have seen worse such as Fighting Tommy Riley, which I thought was pure crap. The Boxer is worth a rental, but hardly a keeper for the dvd library. It really could have been so much more. Give it a shot, but don't expect any great thrills or twists.",1242777600,,456,4.241379310344827
