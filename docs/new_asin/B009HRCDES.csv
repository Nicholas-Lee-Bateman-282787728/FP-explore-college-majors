8541631,3,B009HRCDES,"As most of the time, the cd audio is much better than the DVD audio (strange as is the same date and live recording- they could have taken the mixing board recording and use it for the video). So, expect unwanted distortion in the DVD but good to excellent audio on the cd. Great performance in a more 'laid back/jazzy' mood than his 70s productions (like his Mild Maniac Orchestra project) which were more jazz rock affairs.",1405728000,,425,4.532467532467533
8541632,5,B009HRCDES,"Volker Kriegel (24 December 1943-15 June 2003) was a German jazz guitarist and composer born in Darmstadt, Germany, perhaps most noteworthy for his contributions to the European jazz rock genre and for his collaborations with the American vibraphonist Dave Pike. In 1975 he was a founding member of the United Jazz and Rock Ensemble.

Quite simply I was amazed at this stage of the game, 10 years after his passing, that there would ever be much more music seen here in the USA from Kriegel- most of his music is available simply as imports. In fact much of his music is actually out-of-print currently in Europe.
 So to ever expect to see an official DVD release of this overlooked German jazz guitarist in this country was far too much to ever expect. But here it is all the same. And at a price that one simply cannot argue with.
As of right now (March 2013) there's not a whole bunch of info on the contents here, but I did notice it listed as having 2 discs, so I was very hopeful this wasn't a misprint.
I'm glad to report it isn't.
What we have here is not just for fans of the late Kriegel but also of bassist Eberhard Weber (who even gets a short solo piece here) and fans of Euro-jazz in general.
There's a CD that runs 64 minutes and appears to be the entire set of this concert from November 8 1981 at he Jazzfest Berlin '81, and a nice booklet with details of the concert, and even a (quite small) mini-poster!
The sound is pretty good, maybe not 100% perfect, but this is a live performance from 1981 and perhaps the bottom end on the CD isn't exactly quite as clean as a studio recording would be. I don't even think most people would even notice this, it certainly IS still a professional recording.
Though it could be my stereo that i'm playing the CD on isn't perfect because on the DVD of the concert (which is the same music), the bottom end SEEMS clearer to me and the sound pretty much perfect. But again, i'm listening to this on 2 totally different set of speakers.
The DVD has exactly the same music and runs 70 minutes (though the package actually lists the running time incorrectly as being ""aprox. 56 minutes"", oddly!). The extra running time -6 minutes longer than the CD, appears to be just the result of the bands taking a little time from hitting the stage to when the first piece begins, perhaps some longer gaps between songs, and the audience response to the set after the final song (which prompts Kriegel and the band to come back out, take a bow, but explain in German that although the audience very much wants an encore that the band simply doesn't have any more material prepared). I don't speak German, but his brief comment is explained in the booklet. The DVD is nice in that it actually appears to be a real-time unedited playback of the concert. Camera work is decent, just close-ups of the individual musicians and band as a whole. Not Hi-Def or anything like that BUT the audience for this type of thing is simply more interested in music, and the nice possibility of actually seeing such obscure musicians perform live, not MTV-style herky-jerky nonsense or added ""art films"" or special effects, thankfully. Seeing these musicians play is a rare treat and i'm glad it's unhampered by Hollywood-style video nonsense. This would perhaps only be better if the musicians would have been interviewed, or maybe some behind-the-scenes stuff, though i'm sure none of that was actually filmed. Again, I don't know what the original purpose of filming this was. My guess is that it was done for European television.
After all we will never have the opportunity to see Kriegel play again, and possibly not Eberhard Weber either, since suffering a stroke years ago.
This label is new to me and unknown but they have a winner and I hope they can continue to give us more music of this type and even videos whenever available.

The musicians (and this IS a GREAT band):
Volker Kriegel-Electric Guitar, Electric Sitar
Wolfgang Schluter-Vibraphone
Thomas Bettermann-Keyboards
Eberhard Weber-Upright Bass
Ralf Hubner-Drums, Percussion

 A side-note for Eberhard Weber fans: drummer Hubner played on Weber's very well-loved 1st solo slbum ""The Colours Of Chloe""(1973) and 10 years later on Weber's 1983 disc ""Chorus"".

From Wikipedia:

A self-taught guitarist, Kriegel began playing when he was fifteen and formed a trio three years later that won an award at a 1963 amateur jazz festival. In 1973 he founded Spectrum, a quartet that included Eberhard Weber, among others. In 1975 Kriegel spent a month teaching for the Goethe Institute, an organization he worked for at various points throughout his career. In 1976 Spectrum broke up, and Kriegel started another band called the Mild Maniac Orchestra which stayed together in to the 1980s.

In 1977 Kriegel became the partial owner of a label called Mood Records. He also performed as a sideman for various musicians, including Klaus Doldinger. In addition to music, Kriegel was also a cartoonist who appeared in several German newspapers, a radio broadcaster, and a director of films and author of books related to music.",1363996800,,5104,4.739864864864865
