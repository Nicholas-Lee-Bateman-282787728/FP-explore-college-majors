8450310,5,B004ZOTO4U,"I love this yoga series. This is Ki yoga, it is different but if you think regular yoga is too slow you will like this yoga. I also think the people in the series are enjoyable. Yes, they are from Australia/New Zealand they are quirky, but it's enjoyable. From someone who doesn't like yoga, this series made me change my mind.",1504137600,,327,4.377049180327869
8450311,1,B004ZOTO4U,This is a bunch of DVDs that are recordings from some australian yoga TV. Its lame and pathetic. I get better free things from you tube.,1424736000,,136,4.269230769230769
8450312,5,B004ZOTO4U,"I love these DVDs. It have bought different yoga DVDs and I have found a little of everything easy and hard. However, this particular DVD feels easy at first, but as you continuum to the next section it starts to get harder. I really recommend it to anyone from beginners to advances.",1401235200,,284,4.480769230769231
8450313,5,B004ZOTO4U,First yoga work out I've tried.  You get 4 discs and each disc has four workouts. Started out just doing the Foundation disc I'm now doing them all.  Would totally recommend it to others.,1362182400,,187,4.470588235294118
8450314,4,B004ZOTO4U,"I purchased this after getting Power Pilates set at Target. I wanted a yoga to compliment my Pilates. I found this set very useful. The workouts are short and I didn't find the exercise overly confusing. I have had some experience with both styles of exercise for some time. Some of the yoga is challenging and very strength and balance oriented, but it also provides stretching, breathing, and relaxation. I did not find the instructor hard to understand, although some of her cues can be a little late and some poses seem to be held uneven. I love the dynamic movement while breathing, it gives me a sense of a joint mobility and muscle warming workout, but I am actually helping my body release tension to relax.",1331510400,4,715,4.637795275590551
8450315,2,B004ZOTO4U,"I did not buy this at Amazon, but it's the same video set shown here.  This was not what I expected and I am disappointed in it.  I'll admit I'm a rank newbie when it comes to Yoga, but this video doesn't seem like Yoga at all to me.  It's more like calisthenics.  From the description, I expected it to be a beginner level instructional video on the foundations of yoga.  The instructor says at the beginning that it is something called ""Key Yoga"" (no idea if I spelled that right) which is ""dynamic.""  What she means is, it's really more like calisthenics.

In the first two minutes, she basically has you doing crunches.  That is not Yoga, as far as I'm concerned.  Other than one quick stretch while standing at the beginning, it's all quick moving, calisthenic style exercises.

These videos are recordings of episodes from Yoga TV.

Not impressed.  Have ordered some new videos that will hopefully be better.",1327881600,5,914,4.608695652173913
