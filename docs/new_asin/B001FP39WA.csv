Can't complain when have a series this old.",1420934400,,124,4.681818181818182

I bought another set to give to my brother for Christmas.  I highly recommend this if you cherish the nostalgia of an earlier time.",1358121600,2,255,4.382978723404255
8302219,2,B001FP39WA,"The original (currently deleted) Amos 'n' Andy Show Platinum Edition was a 70-plus show box set of 16 DVDs. Episodes were dubbed from SLP tapes of TV broadcasts. Most were overly blurry and had weak audio.

Don't expect anything more from this current smaller gathering.

Sadly, there is no definitive Amos & Andy collection, and may never be. It's a shame too, for these Charles Barton directed shows were darn good (some were scripted by Paul Henning of later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEVERLY-HILLBILLIES/dp/B002JMRR9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEVERLY HILLBILLIES</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PETTICOAT-JUNCTION/dp/B001E6JC30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PETTICOAT JUNCTION</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GREEN-ACRES/dp/B0000V4906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GREEN ACRES)</a>&nbsp;fame).",1290211200,19,938,9.296703296703297

I believe that the master from which these dvds were made was bad.  I was dissatified with the dvds, but not with the amazon experience since I had no trouble returning the dvds nor in receiving a full refund including my shipping costs to return both sets of dvds.",1238716800,52,407,4.328947368421052
