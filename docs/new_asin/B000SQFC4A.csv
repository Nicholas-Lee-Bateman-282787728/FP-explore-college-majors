2888720,4,B000SQFC4A,"I really like Diego because it teaches animal facts and encourages viewer interaction.  Many of the mystical/magical episodes are framed as a mythology or as the characters jumping into a book.  This DVD does not present it that way.  The first episode is longer and strongly magic themed, the other two are not.

Dolby Digital: English Stereo, Spanish Stereo and French Stereo.

3 Episodes:
Diego's Safari Rescue:  Elephants are turned into stone by a mosquito-turned-sorceress.  Diego, Alicia and Baby Jaguar go to Africa to help Juma find a magic drum to turn them back.  In the English version the episode has mixed in Spanish and Swahili words which seemed to be too many.  My toddler was getting used to learning the Spanish words, but an extra language as well as the Spanish seemed a little overwhelming--he didn't repeat either language that episode.

Panchita the Praire Dog:  Diego and Alicia help a prairie dog find a place to resettle her family.

Jorge the Little Hawk Learns to Migrate:  Jorge the Hawk gets separated from the adult hawks; so Diego helps him out with his Hawk plane.",1257552000,7,1098,4.870270270270271

2888722,5,B000SQFC4A,My son loves this dvd! He doesn't find it confusing in the least.  We only wish more Diego DVDs were available with a spanish track.  Im writing this review in the hope that some producer will start adding Spanish (and other language?) tracks to all the DVDs!  there's a market out there for this!,1240099200,2,297,4.462962962962963
2888723,5,B000SQFC4A,my son loves this dvd.  he's 19 months old and he starts singing the songs and dancing whenever we watch it.  he hasn't quite figured out the concept of answering the questions diego asks but he loves it either way.  it has three episodes in one so its great for keeping him busy,1231804800,,279,4.226415094339623

2888726,5,B000SQFC4A,This is my son's favorite dvd. He loves the new characters and wonderful music. It also holds his attention very well. He never gets bored watching this even though he's seen it so many times. It's such a pleasure to see him laugh out loud as he watches.,1208563200,,254,4.3125
2888727,5,B000SQFC4A,I purchased this video for my 16 month old daughter for Christmas.  She loves it. It came in handy during our flight back home after celebrating Christmas with our family.,1198800000,,171,4.7
2888728,1,B000SQFC4A,"Overly complex-even for Diego. Fails to engage our Dora-loving toddlers. The Spanish track is exhausting to follow due to the bizarre nature of the English/original story.  I loved the idea of Diego in Africa (I'm half African), but it gets lost amid the truly weird - versus creative - stories.  Back to Dora for us.",1198713600,4,317,4.745454545454545
8206292,1,B000SQFC4A,"This may have been a wonderful movie, but we were not able to watch it. There's some kind of code that every movie consists of for different regions & we was in the wrong region of the world, I reckon! We cannot get it to play & we've tried & tried. So my children were extremely disappointed & I was very upset. I think Amazon.com needs to check on this matter before selling movies.",1485820800,,384,4.202702702702703

8206294,5,B000SQFC4A,Go Diego!  This is a great video for kids.  I would like to see more Diego with African or African American characters to help portray black youth in a positive character.,1415577600,,171,4.483870967741935
8206295,5,B000SQFC4A,Great movie - my youngest son loves this one the most out of all the Diego movies. Great price!,1407628800,,95,4.052631578947368

8206301,3,B000SQFC4A,"Truly disappointed in the magic/sorcery themes in this DVD. My almost 3 year old loves Diego because of all the animals but Safari Rescue is less about animals and more about magic and sorcery.  I now know why this was the least expensive DVD on Amazon.  Buyers beware!  Oh, and the only reason I gave 3 stars is that the other two episodes on the DVD are good otherwise it would have been one star.",1324771200,,399,4.293333333333333
