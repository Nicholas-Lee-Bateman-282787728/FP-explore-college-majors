4894504,5,B005UQQR06,"THIS SHOW IS MY GUILTY PLEASURE
CANT WAIT TO SEE ALL MY FAVORITE CONTESTANTS WHENEVER I WANT.

4894505,3,B005UQQR06,"RuPaul's Drag Race continues to wow me season after season. Their was no hesitation when it came to buying Season 2 on dvd. I am glad to see that it is uncensored...BUT WHERE IS SEASON 1? Season 1 was what started it all with some of my favorites, Nina Flowers & Ongina!!! AND WHERE IS UNTUCKED!? Untucked is a HUUUUUGEEEEE part of the show...this season cannot be complete without seeing Mystique yell ""BITCH I AM FROM CHICAGO!""

Also i know LOGO explained why the first season would not be released, saying the music could not be cleared and instead of Untucked...that their would be lots of bonus features...yet there was only a few. The bonus features include meet the contestants, a closer look at the outfits from the ""gone with the window"" episode, Grand finale acting scenes & Reunion fan questions answered.

Overall i am happy with the Season 2 Release, but i can only rate this 3 out of 5 stars. I hope to see Season 1 & both seasons of Untucked released soon!!!",1318809600,2,973,4.554285714285714

4894515,5,B005UQQR06,It was great to see Season 2 all over again. The Countdown to the Crown highlight episode was gagworthy.

And this talented cast doesn't disappoint, neither with looks nor drama.  Heck, checking even the most recent reddits and FB the juicy reality show bitching is still as fresh and alive today.  No other season provided this much staying power to keep us drag race addicts riveted.  Whether you're for Team Tyra camp or Team Raven, these binge-worthy episodes are a celebration of campy drag in all its glory and gory.

To me, all of the seasons, but 7, are great, but why they never put Untucked on (until Season 4), I never understood.

The *only* reason that this gets four stars is because they charge $30+ dollars (depending on the season) for DVD-R media which means I can basically put this into a DVD Burner on my computer and burn it for free. The quality is what Logo produces and thank god my receiver and TV both know how to up-convert it from the standard SD to something a little less than HD since it's not shot in HD, but a DVD-R? Really, Logo (or whomever produces the DVDs, themselves)?",1464480000,,656,4.368852459016393

If you've got to watch mindless television, RuPaul's Drag Race is fun, progressive, and entirely innocuous.  I was never particularly a fan of RuPaul Charles's before this show primarily because I was generally unfamiliar with him and the art-performance of drag.  This show has not only endeared me to RuPaul's creativity, but has also showcased that underneath the clothes (male or female) and inches of makeup, he's actually a font of innate and experience-based wisdom who absolutely deserves a platform to make his voice heard.",1437177600,2,674,5.165137614678899

I was recovering from a plastic surgery and was bored and depressed and I watched hours of it, and it was entertaining, funny, uplifting, creative and it kept my mind off things. If I could have a group of gay men or a group of drag queens in my life every day all my depression and any other life BS problems would vanish. How refreshing that the world is changing slowly and accepts all types of people and RuPaul's dragrace opened alot of eyes. I have a redneck friend for many years who is just awful to the core, but I keep him around for stories to write in my book one day and he had the worst views on drag queens and gay people and I forced him to watch it and a light bulb went off and he changed his views and kind of enjoyed the show. THis is a true redneck people. I don't even let people know I talk to this man. He was my first boyfriend at 16. He moved to Texas and became an alcoholic pot smoking redneck. Hes so entertaining though I have to keep him around, so if he can change his mind, so can others. I loved all the personalities in the show, loved RuPaul, loved the fashion, just loved it. My Father walked in on Mom and I watching this show and couldn't believe we were wasting our time watching it!!!!!!!!!!!! The NERVE! He was out in the living room every night watching cage fighting!

There are fan favorites Pandora Boxx, Raven, and Jujube, which makes us wonder how Tyra won - her low profile, her somnambulance, and her tangible sparklessness are all rather obvious to see.  The trouble with this show is how choppy it seems.  Though it's gotten better of late, I always feel that we're not seeing a lot - a lot! - of what's really going on, what it takes to be a drag queen, the work involved, and the emotional toll of working in a field that doesn't get much respect.  The challenges themselves are always heavily edited (Snatch Game in particular), so the results may not make a lot of sense to viewers.  OTT and loving it.",1361923200,,753,4.35

I watched RuPaul's Season 2 Drag Race on Netflix as a lark; something I would see and then lose interest in.  Well, that didn't happen.  I became completely immersed in the show and hung on every judge's critique and snap from a queen.  What made me keep going through the seasons and to purchase the ones not available on Netflix was RuPaul herself.  The Glamazon has grace and genuine kindness that is not overstated; it's very subtle to see and realize all she is doing for the contestants and for queers in general.

It was so much more, the contestants on Rupaul's dragrace not only stunned me with their fierceness, but truly inspired me to go get out in the world and be who I am.  Entertaining, jaw dropping and at times suspenseful, this show had it all.",1348531200,,341,4.483870967741935
4894704,5,B005UQQR06,"Although I am a gay man, for so long I found it difficult to swallow that gay culture existed.  Our social group seems to be obsessed with sex and superficial squandering.  And in a time when ultra-masculinity is the new moustache, nothing feels exciting or refreshing anymore.  I understand being different is difficult and folks want to fit in and show the world the gays can be just like everyone else, but when did we stop expressing our authentic selves?

Enter Drag Race.  Start with Project Runway . . . toss in a little Tyra, a lot of humor, and finish with a ton of sass.  That's the show.  The contestants have a new challenge every week, each progressively tougher, and in the end the ""Next Drag Superstar"" is crowned.  The production value increases from Season One and there are more and better contestants.  You'll definitely find one hell of an entertaining ride here.

I grew up watching drag queens perform in the gay bars, and to be honest I found them a bit scary.  I believe many people, especially men, feel this way because we are uncomfortable with our feminine side, which these gentle-wo-men find so easy to express.  After watching the show, you'll have new respect for drag queens and see it's definitely an art form.

So in terms of gay culture, Rupaul gives it.  He shows us that while being different is tough, nothing is more valuable than loving and expressing yourself.  I've never been more impressed or proud with a gay celebrity than I am with Rupaul.  He is truly a Super(role)model.  YOU . . . better . . . WORK!",1343174400,18,1550,4.578181818181818

4894706,5,B005UQQR06,Rupaul shows his girls how to be a supermodel and it really fun episodes full of quirky little twists.  Season 2 has some interesting judges including Kathy Griffin..,1335398400,,166,4.928571428571429
4894707,5,B005UQQR06,"I was waiting for the RuPaul Drag Race to come on DVD, I got Season 2 first due  that was my favorite, It contains 3 disc and 12 episodes, including the audition and reunion episodes, some bonus scenes not seen on TV. the whole collection is worthy for any Drag Race fan. the quality image is as good as on Logo TV.",1329264000,,315,4.080645161290323
4894708,5,B005UQQR06,"This show is a giant leap for drag artists (like my self)
And I was so excited to find out that seasons 2 and 3 are available on DVD.
The package came wayyyy before it was suppose to.
And there is a lot of extra footage and a ""meet the queens"" cast interviews.

If you haven't watched this show I really recommend that you do.
It's funny, smart, and the queens, as well as rupaul are gorgeous.
It comes on the logo channel.  On Monday's @ 9/8c

Watch out for me (Nhala LaReine) on season 5!

WERK!!!",1328745600,,499,4.11340206185567
4894709,1,B005UQQR06,"No Season 1 due to ""music not being cleared"", no Untucked, no Drag U, no Bluray option...?

Thanks but No Thnx, get back to your loyal fans who are just DYING (!!!) to buy this long overdue product when this herrific, drag-injustice is cleared up.. This is not Mildred Fierce LOGO TV!!",1321056000,2,285,4.480769230769231
4894710,1,B005UQQR06,"I have to say, I got SO super excited reading these shows are coming out on DVD and not just iTunes but when I read the DVDs do not include The Untuck Episodes, I became very disappointed, I mean the untuck epidoses are part of the main show so why not include them on these releases?  It makes no sense whatsoever to give the fans only half of the entertainment of what RDR has become to SO many fans worldwide.  I will not even go into the drama behind the Season 1 DVD release.  It makes me even more upset, I mean who uses other people's songs and not get clearance first?  Not cool at all to deprive the fans from owning these tremendously funny and riot episodes.  And yes, I know there is always iTunes but not everyone is into downloading stuff, some of us still prefer actual DVDs/CDs.  Needless to say, I will not be buying these DVDs as I feel they are incomplete!  I can only hope there is a second edition somewhere down the road with eveything included for each season, :-)",1320883200,5,987,4.274193548387097
4894711,5,B005UQQR06,"Just like everyone else, I was ecstatic to see these shows finally get a DVD release. But just like everyone else, I had some questions I wanted answered before purchasing. Rather than freaking out and spamming the comments with ""WHERE'S SEASON 1?!?!?!?"", I decided to go straight to the source and ask the team over at RuPaul's Drag Race directly, via Facebook. These were my questions, and these were their answers:

Me: ""Is Season 1 coming to DVD as well? And are the ""Untucked!"" episodes included with the Season 2 & 3 DVD's?""

LOGO: ""Hi doll, lucite heels are clear, but some of our music for season one couldn't be cleared. Untucked isn't on the DVDs but lots of extras.""

So understand ladies and ladyboys, they did try to put Season 1 on DVD, but licensing the music (probably Destiny's Child) was probably a bit too expensive. But don't be sad, Amazon sells all of Season 1 digitally, so at least you can own it in some form.",1320796800,57,934,4.5476190476190474
