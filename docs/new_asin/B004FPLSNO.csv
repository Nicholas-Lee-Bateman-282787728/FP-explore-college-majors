4370844,5,B004FPLSNO,"Great workout for the body and soul!  I also have Theresa Rowe's ""Pilates for the Soul"" DVD and I love that one as well.",1363305600,2,120,4.0
8428174,5,B004FPLSNO,"Great work out. About the right speed. Many senior exercise DVD's are too slow and take too much time explaining. This moves right along and you get a good workout in 56 mins, or you can divide it up.",1528416000,,200,4.153846153846154
8428175,3,B004FPLSNO,"This is a very basic strength training dvd. The exercises are clearly communicated and it is a good workout for someone just getting started. I would have given it a 4 star review, but the reduction of 1 star isn't for the dvd it's to let the seller know that this dvd had an absolutely awful smell! Kind of like dead fish smell. I have no idea where it could have been stored to make it smell like this, but it is nasty!",1527465600,,421,4.0843373493975905
8428176,5,B004FPLSNO,"Would give it a six if possible. Our exercise group are 65 and over. This dvd is the best for strength, stretching and overall exercises, with a Christian base and good Christian verses, which is a plus! It lasts 55 minutes and you will need weights and a chair. Well worth the money!",1527465600,,284,4.377358490566038
8428177,5,B004FPLSNO,Just what I need to get back into a regular exercise habit after a long hiatus.  I  especially like the lower body workout.,1501804800,,123,4.304347826086956
8428178,2,B004FPLSNO,"Nothing great, very low aerobic",1455753600,,31,5.4
8428179,1,B004FPLSNO,Didn't care for this. The pace was not easy to keep up with. Seemed confusing.... Gave it away.,1455148800,2,95,4.333333333333333
8428180,3,B004FPLSNO,I wish I could give an honest review about this DVD.  The exercises seemed to be just what I was looking for as far as strength training went but the DVD would not play.  Well it would start (I got the FBI warning) and then it would stop.  I would hit the play button again and it would start and then stop.  I know it's not my DVD player because I put in another exercise DVD (Prayfit 33) I had and it played perfect fine.,1450051200,,423,3.9411764705882355
8428181,3,B004FPLSNO,Surprisingly tough work-out... a little long without combining moves.  Not my favorite.,1434585600,2,87,6.25
8428182,5,B004FPLSNO,"An excellent workout that can be tamed down for those with injuries or needing a gentler workout or ramped up by using heavier weights.  Theresa shows modifications and the workout is not so complicated that you could not devise your own modifications.  I am moderately in shape and workout regularly at a gym, so I used heavier weights and sometimes used both arms rather than one at a time.  I also have several joints that need special protection, and so glad that I was able to work up a sweat and workout safely!!!",1420675200,3,519,4.559139784946237
8428183,5,B004FPLSNO,Very helpful!,1415318400,,13,6.0
