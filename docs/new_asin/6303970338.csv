7858981,4,6303970338,"This series makes it to my top 10 for Japanese Animation, unfortunately it seems to have fallen under the radar. Hopefully they'll transfer it to DVD one day, but for now since it was only ever a short mini-series its been put on the back burner. The story & characters are very well thought out, to go with the normal kill em all & tounge & cheak sexual inuendo. Since it is a mini-series & not a seasonal show every minute is at full speed. Yet it's all balanced & does have a message, but that to is balanced with the entertainment of the story",1191715200,2,547,4.219047619047619
