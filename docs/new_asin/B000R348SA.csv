2857548,4,B000R348SA,"THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE LEGEND FILMS DVD: BLUE COVER, SHOWING LAUREL & HARDY IN COLOR AGAINST A ""CURTAIN"" BACKGROUND. THERE IS ANOTHER ""BEST OF LAUREL AND HARDY"" WITH DIFFERENT CONTENT.

To my very pleasant surprise, this is not the usual DVD repackaging of public-domain Laurel & Hardy material. It's really the very obscure 1968 compilation feature THE BEST OF LAUREL AND HARDY, compiled by James L. Wolcott using 1930s footage licensed from producer Hal Roach. This new Legend Films DVD offers the film in a pleasantly colorized version as well as in black-and-white. There is no narration or original musical score, the clips are not identified by film title, and there is no attempt to bridge them together; each sequence stands as a separate comic episode, with the original musical underscoring intact.

There are 11 Laurel & Hardy comedies represented, usually in lengthy excerpts. In order of appearance:

NIGHT OWLS features the boys as ""cat"" burglars (who make meowing sounds!). In BELOW ZERO they're street musicians who offend everybody, including Amazonian Blanche Payson, who looks meaner in color with her thin, grim mouth! A quick clip from ONE GOOD TURN has them trying to sell their old Model T for $100. THE LIVE GHOST has Stan and Ollie hired to shanghai a crew for a seagoing skipper. PARDON US, the team's first feature film, is represented by the opening sequence, the ""dentist's office"" scene, and the climactic jailbreak in the last reel. (This last sequence reads very well in color, with the added tints distinguishing what had been a drab monochrome cast.) LAUGHING GRAVY involves Stan and Ollie trying to protect their dog during a snowstorm. BE BIG! picks up in the middle of the original subject, concentrating on Ollie trying to take off his too-tight leather boots. COUNTY HOSPITAL is seen in its first reel, with Stan ruining convalescent Ollie's hospital stay. OUR WIFE has Mr. Hardy trying to elope (a tapestry visible in the doorway is carefully colored). The ""telephone"" sequence from THEIR FIRST MISTAKE is shown, ending with Mae Busch angrily chasing the boys away. The final sequence is an intelligently compressed version of the feature OUR RELATIONS, with Stan and Ollie appearing as themselves and their seafaring, good-time twin brothers. This compilation ends as OUR RELATIONS ends: the picture fades and the vintage-1936 end title appears.

Legend's color palette in this one is subtler and more realistic than the garish colors seen in Legend's Three Stooges DVDs of 2005. Careful attention was paid to the color (Stan wears a brown suit in the first sequence only; for the rest of the movie he's got the authentic gray flannel suit.)

Bonus features, all in black-and-white, include coming-attractions trailers for THE DANCING MASTERS (in a superb print, even better than the one included in 20th Century-Fox's own DVD release) and A CHUMP AT OXFORD, as well as Laurel & Hardy's only appearance on live television in the ""This Is Your Life"" biography program. Print quality of ""This Is Your Life"" seen in this DVD is fair to middling; casual fans will appreciate its inclusion here but dyed-in-the-wool L & H admirers can find an upgrade sold elsewhere on the Amazon site.

Very few Laurel & Hardy buffs have seen THE BEST OF LAUREL AND HARDY, and the new colorized DVD adds even more novelty value. At 84 minutes, it makes a nice sampler of Laurel & Hardy's brand of visual comedy, and it's entirely suitable for the whole family. Hats off to Legend for finding an excellent print of this ""lost"" feature, and for making it available in such an enjoyable, viewer-friendly form.",1353974400,11,3629,4.98019801980198
2857549,3,B000R348SA,"If you're a big fan of Laurel and Hardy,like I am,then don't bother with this. If you're looking for their solo work,it's already available elsewhere and probably better quality. When is it that companies are going to start releasing the shorts they did for Hal Roach and quit recycling the same old thing all the time??I would love to see the box set that was released in Britain last year or year before released over here. It has everything the Boys ever did,including the foreign versions! How come we don't get that??Don't we deserve that at least?? Buyer beware:Some copies,like this one, might be transferred from VHS and not digitally remastered. You deserve better!",1184976000,34,674,4.921052631578948
2857550,3,B000R348SA,"***2013 update*** Amazon is confusing reviews by combining reviews for different products. This is NOT for the 1968 feature just released, it is for an older collection of Laurel & Hardy solo shorts***
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Laurel-Hardy/dp/B000R348SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Laurel & Hardy</a>&nbsp;and the GO ENTERTAINMENT 6-disc GREEN Box DVD & Book set.

This DVD is designed to mis-lead buyers.  First the title of the DVD implies they are a team as ""Laurel & Hardy"", but this is their solo work.  Then they use a picture of Laurel & Hardy from around 1935 when they were a team in their top form, but these shorts are 10 to 20 years earlier when both were refining their screen personas.

This is hardly the ""Best of Laurel & Hardy"", it is more like a study of Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy's solo work.

***To confuse matters further, GO ENTERTAINMENT is selling a 6-disc GREEN Box DVD & Book set also called ""The Best of Laurel & Hardy Prermium Collector's Edition"". (Currently not sold on Amazon)
This set features films digitized from VHS tapes poorly mastered from 16mm prints. Do not confuse this set with another called ""Laurel & Hardy Premium Collection"", that one is much better!

Again, this is NOT truly a collection of the Best of Laurel & Hardy. And the book has nothing to do with the films in the set, it talks about the team. & includes a filmography of their teamed films. Don't waste your money on this green box set, the films look awful & the book (which holds the discs) tells nothing new.

****Now there is a 1960's feature compilation of clips from their classic films released on DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Laurel-and-Hardy/dp/B008SOS994/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Laurel and Hardy</a>.  This was actually called ""The Best Of Laurel & Hardy"" in theaters, and it truly is the best of Laurel & Hardy. But it is just clips of their Hal Roach sound shorts, not a collection of the complete films.****",1183507200,47,3604,4.912828947368421

alot of 10 minute clips that are taken from longer films &
shorts, but very funny and NOT the common footage always
shown. A bargain! Despite the conflicting reviews on this dvd,
(which confused me, on which material it actually is) I took a
chance and listened to the POSITIVE one, which was in this
case CORRECT!  Also, the colorization was absolutely awesome,
not garish at all but very well-done. This one is a steal!!",1373241600,,480,4.714285714285714

The last half hour of 1hr25mins is solely showcasing Our Relations (1936) film & this is good. The film print has been digitally restored & is swappable in B&W + colour versions. This film is worth collecting as virtually unheard of in Sons circles as it was not issued to public domain only cinemas. It has 3 trailers,babes in toyland,a chump at oxford & the dancing masters + 30mins of L&Hs This is your life in america(1954).Its well worth money at less than a $7.5 a disc & will become a rare collectable item,grab it while you can,I'm sure it won't ever be released a 2nd time in any form.
