8729232,2,B013YZMYBU,"Dopey and slow moving Hong Kong thriller about a man who killed his wife (Lau Ching Wan, excellent) who was found insane and sent to an asylum.  After several years there his psychiatrist (Huang Xiaoming) deems him sane as long as he takes his medication and releases him back into the world.

Hong Kong movies aren't generally known for the high quality of their screenwriting and Insanity is simply way too dumb to pull off what it is attempting--although with a rewrite a Korean or American remake could make the material work.  Basically Insanity is juggling three different types of stories and never figures out how to incorporate them smoothly into a single slick thriller.

Story number one concerns whether Lau Ching Wan's Fan was ever insane in the first place or fooled the courts and the doctors and got away with murder.  This plot strand never really goes anywhere because Fan isn't given a strong enough motive to want to kill his wife if he wasn't insane.  Story number two concerns Fan's mother-in-law who basically wants to pull a Psycho 2 and get Fan to pay a greater price for murdering her daughter by driving him to suicide, murder or insanity.  Plot number two doesn't work because it's underdeveloped and all but abandoned after the film's first half.  Plot number three is the old psychiatrist tries to frame his patient for a crime the psychiatrist has committed or wants to commit.  Plot number three doesn't work because it isn't introduced until way too late in the film--that should have been in the movie early and part of the reason the psychiatrist pushed for his patient's release in the first place.

Insanity looks great and Lau Ching Wan at least is good although he is stuck with a badly underwritten character whose mental state and motivations are never really very clear because of the muddled plotting.  Huang Xiaoming's Doctor Chow is never interesting and the big reveal about his past is handled very poorly.

Unless you are a die hard fan of Hong Kong flicks it's hard to imagine a reason someone would actually want to sit through this--it's a total failure as a thriller with zero suspense and fatally sloppy plotting but it does have the polish you expect from Hong Kong productions--Insanity has the sleek look of a Johnnie To crime film but beyond being pretty to look at it's dumb and mostly very dull.",1440979200,,2354,4.756756756756757
