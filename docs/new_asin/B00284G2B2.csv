3871811,5,B00284G2B2,"As with previous 4 seasons, this one was very entertaining.  But I thought that the quality of the designers was not quite up to snuff compared to prior seasons.  Especially the early eliminations - some of these designers were just odd, and not so talented.  The final 4 were quite good, though.",1253577600,,296,4.653846153846154

""Project Runway: Season Five""
(Bravo, 2009)
----------------------------------------
Despite the behind-the-scenes production delays and legal wranglings, Season Five of ""Project Runway"" emerges as one of the strongest shows to date, perhaps rivaling Season One in terms of its narrative arc.  The season starts off slow, with a cast packed with the usual mix of narcissism, talent and self-delusion, but as the season progresses many, if not all, of the unlikeable contestants wind up seeming pretty sympathetic. It's not clear that the raw talent or wow factor is as widespread this time around, but the winning designer's runway show is breathtaking, and really feels like a world-class fashion production. There do seem to be a lot of questionable calls on the judges' parts -- sometimes I found myself wondering if they were tailoring their decisions more for the drama of the series, rather than for pure fashion. (Really?  You like those drapey, flowy things that much? Hmmm.) Also, I think their decision on the elimination from five to four contestants was just utterly wrong: the rock'n'roll outfit was exactly, spot-on perfect, and way better than the other designs. Oh, well. Poor guy.)

Anyway, it was a fun season, and fans of Tim Gunn should be especially pleased with how much more of his persona comes through.  Looking forward to Season Six! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1253059200,2,1436,5.368888888888889
3871813,4,B00284G2B2,"There is nothing like wasting an entire weekend watching a Project Runway marathon.  Ahhhhhh,it is FABULOUS!

Season Five features some interesting competitors who have fantastic talent and creativity.  A few (Kenley!) are annoying, but they still have a unique point of view that is fun to watch.

The bigest disappointment was the lack of any interesting extra features.  True, the episodes themselves were extra-long (and worth the extra footage!)  but there is little else.  I would have especially enjoyed an episode featuring the search for the competitors....it is always fun to see what the eventual winners bring to their auditions as well as the wacky creations of wannabe fashion designers.  Additionally, would it be so difficult to put on extra features with outtakes from the show?  What about Tim Gunn commenting on what he REALLY thought of the designers?  (""Tell me Tim, didn't you just want to strangle Kenley?"")  What about Heidi making some extra comments?  I'm sure she has some...

Definitely something for a fan to buy, but I'm always wishing for more.",1252713600,3,1075,5.109195402298851
3871814,3,B00284G2B2,"I LOVE project runway. since it doesn't run in germany (where i live) i always order the dvds from the US. so i wonder everytime why they cannot just NOT tell the winner on the backside of the dvd?? this time i just didn't look on the backside, but then the winner was shown in the menue of the dvd....
i missed the reunion and also the ""wear are they now"" - there was just a short interview with the winner. the extras are too few.

heidi strikes me as quite heartless - there is never any empathy and she just says her lines.

but still i watched the season in almos just one go! it's marvellous. but no project runway season will ever come up to season 2 (santino!). that was the BEST.",1252627200,13,688,4.126865671641791
3871815,5,B00284G2B2,"I've never enjoyed the reunion show.  So I didn't miss it at all.  I watch this show to see the design challenges and then the shows resulting from those challenges.  I am somewhat interested in the personalities on the show but that is a much more distant interest.  There always seems to be one character everyone hates and that was true of this season too.  I think that is just human nature, especially in a competitive setting.  I thought there was a lot of talent on this season.  By the time we got down to the final four contestants, I was having a heck of a time choosing and I usually don't have this much of a problem.  Usually the soon-to-be-winner is standing out by the time we get down to that few.

One thing that always bothers me about this show is that there is never any prize for the two runners up.  I think there should be some consolation prizes for them.  Certainly all these companies involved in this show can come up with something for them.  If nothing else, give all three of them a free vacation at a spa so they can recuperate from all that tension and hard work.

This is the last season that was shot in New York.  For Season 6, which I am now watching, the show has moved to L.A.

I must also say that Heidi Klum continues to irritate me season after season.  I don't know what is so offputting about her but with each season I renew and intensify the feeling that wouldn't it be nice if I never had to hear or see her again.  I do not have that problem with Tim Gunn, Michael Kors or Nina Garcia.  They are fine.",1252195200,2,1548,4.207482993197279
3871816,4,B00284G2B2,"Season Five of ""Project Runway"" is still fun and addictive entertainment like the previous seasons. I also agree with one of the reviewers that criticized Tim Gunn as a judge in the final runway show, couldn't they just choose one of the winners from the previous seasons, like Christian? He is the mentor and taskmaster, now he has to fill in as a judge also?  Season 5 contestants are an interesting mix, but I can think about some past seasons as a bit more sophisticated. Also you could guess who would be the winner, if you watch the show from the beginning, so there is less suspense compared to previous seasons. I watched all the seasons, I definitely hope the later seasons on Lifetime would be getting better. Project Runway is still one of the best reality shows on TV. I happen to like the Amazing Race also.",1250640000,,820,4.54054054054054
3871817,4,B00284G2B2,I watch this in the UK and eagerly awaited the delivery of Season 5 but it's not up to the standard of the other seasons and I felt short changed - particularly missed the reunion!,1250208000,2,180,4.171428571428572
3871818,3,B00284G2B2,"I am a great fan of PR so I would buy this anyway. But in terms of getting your money's worth - this DVD is so sadly lacking the extra trimmings that the other 4 seasons had - no behind the scene, no reunion show!! Why?? The only bonus in the BONUS is a follow-up on winner Leanne during her Elle mag photo-shoot. The box said the DVD included extended episodes - but I didn't notice them, so it's hard to see where the cost of the DVD is justifiable.

I love Tim Gunn but do not agree with Tim Gunn being the judge for the final runway show, it diminishes his impartiality and integrity as a non-bias mentor. Surely they could pull in another celebrity guest judge! Even Fern Mallies had to be better than Tim Gunn.",1250035200,3,716,4.188405797101449
3871819,5,B00284G2B2,"Our daughter Jennifer made it onto Project Runway Season 5 as a designer. So of course, we think this DVD is top notch! Season 5 designers received very little fanfare - no promos, no opening credits, no reunion show, etc. There was a lot of speculation on why, but we're hoping that the extra footage promised on this DVD shows more of her and the other designers. While she was raised in East Syracuse, NY, she's been living in Italy for the last several years. As PR5 makes its way around Europe this year, Jennifer's being recognized more and more. We even heard she got recognized by an American tourist the other day! We look forward to having a copy of this DVD. It's like watching home movies when we see her on air. If you appreciate her designs, see some of her Suite line on etsy.",1248998400,10,791,4.387755102040816

3871837,5,B00284G2B2,"I don't sew, but I adore this show!

Each season begins with approximately 12-16 up-and-coming fashion designers selected to compete for the opportunity to design a show for Fashion Week in Bryant Park of New York City.  Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints.  The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).

In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show.  The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!""  And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques.  And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.

But at the core of it all is the fashion.  It is really interesting to watch the clothes come to life in each challenge, culminating in a runway show.

If you like fashion, you'll love Project Runway!",1341705600,,1285,5.04739336492891

3871839,2,B00284G2B2,"My daughter and I thought this season was disappointing.  Not many of the contestants were likeable, their designs weren't spectacular, and the last challenge (evening gown)was so banal that I thought the designers were going to be told to get back to the workroom and really CREATE!  We DID miss the reunion show although I imagine it would have been rather catty. The ""WEAR is the Winner Now"" segment just showed her at the ELLE photo shoot and didn't give any information on what she was doing 6 months after the show.

Then add to this mix the judges, designers and the crazy challanges (can YOU make an outfit out of a garbage bag?) and you have a show that you just can't miss!  I LOVE THIS!  Season Five was not a disappointment, either.  It delivered the goods!  Lots of excitement and watching your favorite designer get voted off, or one who SHOULD get the boot but stays...well, it's DRAMA plain and simple!
