8252524,5,B0013PVGI6,"Serials were very big in the 1920's to the 40's. Most people who think of serials think of Flash Gordon,Buck Rogers,Batman,Gene Autry but there were many others over the years as a matter of fact over 230 sound serials were released fro 1930 to 1956. Before the fade out came with tv. Tailspin Tommy was a comic strip in the 1930's so when Universal Pictures decided to release this serial it put the kids fannies in the shows every saturday afternoon to watch one chapter at a time for the next 12 weeks. Very popular and in 1935 they released a sequel Tailspin Tommy and the Great Air Mystery. Ok the airplanes are old and it's black and white but a great serial and the copy looks great for being 83 years old.imagine that, I got it from Amazon.com it came fast.

8252526,3,B0013PVGI6,"1930s serials can have a charm of their own--wonderful nonsense. And coupled with aviation history, this makes ""Tailspin Tommy"" an interesting entertainment: How did those wobbly, fragile aeroplanes stay in the air?! And then what about that Oedipal subtext!",1317513600,,258,5.641025641025641
8252527,5,B0013PVGI6,"""Tailspin Tommy"" was released in 1934 by Universal Pictures, based on the newspaper strip by Hal Forrest.  It stars Maurice Murphy, Patricia Farr and Noah Beery, Jr., and was directed by Louis Friedlander (aka Lew Landers).

Would-be aviator, Tommy Tompkins (Maurice Murphy) and his buddy Skeeter Milligan (Noah Beery, Jr.) help Milt Howe (Grant Withers) whose 'plane has been forced to land in Littleville.  Howe's arm was broken in the landing, but with Tommy's help he is able to complete the test mail run.  For his successful, if rough landing of the 'plane and saving the mail contract Tommy and Skeeter are given jobs at Three Point.  Tommy gets his pilot's license, and is soon flying missions, along with Milt Howe and Betty Lou Barnes (Patricia Farr).  Working against Three Point is a new flyer, Bruce Hoyt (Walter Miller) who is really an agent of Wade ""Tiger"" Taggart (John Davidson), head of a rival air service.

The style is as suggested by the original advertising, ""Your Favorite Cartoon"" and the characters are remarkably (and appropriately) two-dimensional, played with apparent enthusiasm by the cast.  The citizens of Littleville are especially delightful in this respect.  While the chapters end with cliffhangers, the serial is episodic, with most of the adventures complete within a chapter or two, the only continuing story being the attempts by ""Tiger"" Taggart and his henchmen to sabotage Three Point.  Much humor is present, and handled very well in this serial.  There isn't much background music, as expected for a film of this age, but some rather familiar themes used in the 1936 Flash Gordon serial show up in the ""next week"" and chapter introduction titles.

VCI's edition, #8527 is on a single DVD.  The main title has a copyright by Serials Incorporated over a grainy still-frame, and the focus is a little off.  The edge focus of the chapter ""recap"" titles is also a little soft, but the chapters themselves are a lot better, the image clean and sharp, with good gray scale and very few splices.  The sound is clear enough most of the time, though some form of low-level noise limiting seems to have been used, occasionally muffling the dialogue a little.  Still, a remarkably good transfer.  As ""extras"" there are four serial movie trailers, for Tailspin Tommy, Captain Video, Tim Tyler's Luck and Junior G-Men of the Air.

That's quite a combination of good factors; for those not allergic to films of the 1930's and naive plots this is an excellent release, and it shows what Universal could do with a serial movie when they made the effort.",1306108800,3,2582,4.923787528868361
