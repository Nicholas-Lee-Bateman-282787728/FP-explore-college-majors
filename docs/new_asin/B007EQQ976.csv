8515469,1,B007EQQ976,"I am a long time Shakira fan. There may have been one fact I didn't previously know. I'm not sure who thought that this DVD would be good to sell. There was a lot of repetition by the interviewed narrators and the voice narrator, making it seem longer than it really is. The girl in the video is just some random nobody who seems to not even know anything about her although she is really excited to be on the video. The background music isn't Shakira's. The live pieces covered in talking and repetition. The only good thing about this DVD is the cover.",1372636800,3,554,4.336538461538462
8515470,1,B007EQQ976,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I wasted $13 on this. It literally is a bunch of people who I've never heard of and have no credentials (beyond being Shakira fans) parroting things they were told to say or read on the web. I didn't notice the microscopic ""Unauthorized"" note until I had gotten home. Other credits from this director include ""Amy Whinehouse: Fallen Star"" and ""Taylor Swift: American Beauty"". When I am done with this review I am contacting FYE corporate headquarters (the outlet where I purchased the DVD) and demanding an explanation as to why their Quality Control department didn't sort this bloodsucking leech of a DVD out before it was deemed shelf worthy.",1347148800,3,688,4.7899159663865545
8515471,1,B007EQQ976,"Like the other reviewer, I am truly a huge Shakira fan.  I have purchased similar UNAUTHORIZED bios of musicians that I like but I am always wary because they can end up like this one.  This DVD gives you no more information about Shakira than you can pull off Wikipedia.  There is no unique or ""previously unseen"" video of Shaki, just a few very brief snip-its from some of her videos.  I know more about Shakira than the people ""interviewed"" on this DVD.  They never met her.  One young woman, when talking about Shaki, states ""I think Shakira probably....blah blah blah.""  Great, baseless speculation from a lucky fan about what they think Shakira's musical motivation is.  Really.  The ""Man on the Street"" or ""Fan on the Street"" interviews offer nothing.  They should have put me on this DVD because at least I have actually been to a Shakira concert (Atlantic City - AWESOME) so in these terms I have more ""first hand contact"" with Shaki than they do.  There are no interviews with actual friends or relatives of Shaki, no interviews with any band members (I'm looking at you Shaki's drummer Brendan Buckley) or musical collaborators/ producers, and NO INTERVIVEW WITH SHAKI. What this disappointing DVD points to is Shaki's fans really want a truly authorized informative comprehensive bio / background DVD about Shaki that includes Shaki.  C'mon her story is GOLD.  Colombian roots, musical beginnings to her transformation into one of the coolest, most talented singer, songwriter, dancer, philanthropist and general human ball of amazing energy & talent.  So Shakira, if you are reading this, please get with your people and put together an AUTHORIZED bio DVD because you know all your fans would love it.  Hips don't lie and neither do I.  PS - Call me........",1343865600,5,1770,4.889261744966443
8515472,2,B007EQQ976,"I am a Shakira fan and hoped for some performance clips mixed in with this biography. At no time in the ~1/2 hour play time, do we ever hear Shakira sing or speak. However there are many passages when we see her sing and speak while another person narrates related info. The video quality is fair, at best. The audio quality is poor. Three unknown, but well-informed, fans comprise much of the biography. With much narration, this is a good summary of her history and an excellent recap of her significant career events. The typical FBI warning about not making unauthorized copies of this DVD are published, however it would be a waste of time, media and resources to make such a copy. If you want my copy, it will be for sale at the Amazon used category soon.",1340928000,3,761,4.482014388489208
