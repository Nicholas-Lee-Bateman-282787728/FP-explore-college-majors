6340191,5,B00J9BZ4O8,"Great product, excellent movie and 3D presentation. This double feature, at $30, is cheaper than the now out of print 3 disc set of HUGO.  In fact, the package includes the same discs (3D blu, 2D blu, and DVD)!!  I only bought it for HUGO.  OWL is a nice family oriented CGI animated movie that I had never heard of. That film includes 3D blu and 2D blu discs. 5 discs in all, individual titles are in 2 separate blu cases with original labeling.",1468540800,2,446,4.285714285714286

6340197,5,B00J9BZ4O8,After collecting and viewing hundreds of 3D movies I must say I am an old school pop out effect guy..but I also enjoy 3D Depth when it's done right And boy does Hugo knock it out of the park with depth..nothing better that I've seen as far as depth for 3D..inside the clock tower especially where alot of the movie takes place.with the gears and mechanical parts are constantly spinning..inside noticed very little ghosting on my equipment.. This movie was Martin Scorsese's first 3D attempt and he knocked it out of the park..wow what a masterpiece of 3D Depth ..This film makes my top 5 list out of hundreds of 3d movies on depth alone..my top 5 are as follows #5 A christmas Carrol with Jim Carrey animated film.#4 Hugo #3 sammys adventure 2 .#2 sammys adventure a secret passage (Hong Kong version) and #1 Thunder and the house of magic..all of the top 3 are made by nwave productions..and are the best pop out 3d effects of my entire collection and best effects I've ever seen..check them out on amazon..you want be sorry if you buy and watch and love 3D pop out effects like me and my family. .,1453420800,5,1100,4.477611940298507

And both set come with 3d Blu ray disc, Blu ray Disc  and DVD there the same if you buy them separately but separately they cost more around 40 bucks plus taxes.

Legends of the Guardians was terrible and I give it 1 star.
Forget this twin pack and just buy Hugo.",1426896000,,182,3.945945945945946
6340356,5,B00J9BZ4O8,"The 3D in both of these films is fantastic! Some of the best I've ever seen. I would buy these movies for the 3D effects alone. I like that, even though it's a ""double feature"", each movie still gets it's own case. I really do feel like I got a 2 for 1 deal here!",1426291200,8,263,3.8

8648945,5,B00J9BZ4O8,"Hugo shows the true imprint of an original artist like scorsese. Through this film we gain insight not only to his creative process, but also his soul. Watching this at the cinema literally made me tear up during the history of cinema montages. Through this we see such an expression for the love of cinema that Scorsese has.",1523491200,,325,4.620689655172414

8648947,5,B00J9BZ4O8,"I've had the Blu-ray of HUGO from the day it was released and consider it be one the true classics of the screen. Recently I purchased a projector that has the ability to project the 3-D format and wanted to add the 3-D version of HUGO to my collection. I came across the Double Feature 3-D of HUGO and LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS. I consider HUGO to have the best use of the 3-D process that I have ever seen. GUARDIANS, which I had seen in 2-D, is also much more effective in the 3-D process.",1489017600,,490,4.114583333333333

8648949,5,B00J9BZ4O8,"The Double Feature was cheaper than Hugo by itself, and they both still came in their own individual cases inside the slip jacket. Hugo is a beautiful movie, the Owl movie is exciting, a nice bonus, truly a Double Feature, like buy one for less than full price, and still get another one free. Especially grateful because 3D blu-rays are often pricey. Hugo is shot in native 3-D, no post conversion, and really is incredible.",1487808000,,425,4.68
