7861604,5,6304096593,"I suspect this is NOT on DVD because of probable clearance issues with the music used on the soundtrack (such as Vince Guaraldi's ""Cast Your Fate To The Wind""). Disappointing. Everything is so caught up in legal bulls*** these days.",1433203200,2,232,4.825
7861605,5,6304096593,"This tape was used in support of an aviation history class I teach at the local community college. It has excellent historical footage and stills of the construction and early flights of the Spirit of St Louis, which I have not found in other resources. It also has clips of his ill-fated competitors in the Orteig Prize race. It deals only with the events surrounding his flight to Paris and doesn't drag in unrelated trivia or speculation. It also deals with Lindbergh's discomfort with his unexpected fame, in a way that helps explain why he was so immensely popular. Highly recommended. If only this were available on DVD...",1237161600,2,628,4.824074074074074
7861606,5,6304096593,"My son had just written a biography on Charles Lindbergh and I thought I'd rent this documentary for him.  I wound up watching it.  It was unbelievable!  Fantastic use of real films and sound recordings cleaned up.  I found myself rewinding and watching the clips over and over.  With the airplane only 15 years on, it really shows how scary this must have been.  It also shows the surprising effect this had on Lindbergh.  The music is a crazy but stragely appropriate mix of Ellington, Miles Davis, Whitman and other long lost late 20s bands.",1237075200,2,544,4.663157894736842
