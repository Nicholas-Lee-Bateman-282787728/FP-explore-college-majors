7927789,5,B00004YZH4,"I love, love, love this postnatal workout.  Too bad I'm moving on to other workouts now that I feel back in shape.  This video has it all for getting back in shape gently after giving birth.  Some of the exercizes/stretches can be done as soon as you feel like it, while others you would want to work into as you recover.  This tape progresses nicely from very easy stretches and poses, to more intense poses.  There are modifications for all fitness levels and the instructions are clear.  The exercizes are geared to target the exact muscles that need to be toned and strengthened after childbirth.  This is an effective workout without being strenuous or exhausting (after all, who really feels like a strenuous workout after a few hours of sleep?)",1071446400,3,751,4.730769230769231
