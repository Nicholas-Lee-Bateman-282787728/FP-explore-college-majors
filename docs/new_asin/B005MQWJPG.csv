4835014,4,B005MQWJPG,"Hiccup's got a good heart and a bright mind, and likes to try new things.  Unfortunately none of those traits are in demand among the Vikings ... and, as it turns out, he's a young Viking.  They pride themselves on brawn, rather than brain.  They value the ruthless and courageous, the dragon killers, rather than the clever and kind and empathetic.  Of course, since he's the star of the movie, we know he's going to show that what he has is what they need, and that he'll save his village and prove himself to his father along the way.  It's the same tried and true formula that has formed the emotional core of so many animated films, about an out-of-place young person who proves himself to his people and his parent(s) by being completely different from them and doing just what they would never do.  It's what made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudolph-s/dp/B000A345E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudolph's</a>&nbsp;nose bright, what made Remy's nose sensitive (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratatouille/dp/B000VBJEEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratatouille</a>), and what made Flik so clever (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bug-s-Life/dp/B00007LVCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bug's Life</a>).  What keeps folks following the formula is that it works.  We all root for the under-appreciated underdog, because, at bottom, we all think we are one, but what we really want for the outsider is that he or she (and we) be accepted by the insiders.  The formula, though, feels fresh enough here to work quite well.

With this film and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Panda/dp/B001ECQ75A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Panda</a>, it seems the Dreamworks folks have finally learned that the the easy laughs that come with the endless pop cultural references (of shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shark-Tale/dp/B0006JMLRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shark Tale</a>) just make a movie seem stale on a second or third viewing.  While that one was amusing enough the first time in theaters, by the time it came out on dvd it just felt lame.  Kung Fu Panda, though, feels fresh after a few viewings, and I'm certain this one will too.  The range of personalities among the Vikings makes them all consistently interesting, the dragons, especially in flight, are delightfully rendered; there are moments of awe and there are slow moments where you can really connect with the characters.  While I wouldn't consider this a flawless film - the final showdown and the final revelations about the dragons that came with it seemed a bit too easy and contrived - it is nevertheless a beautifully animated and very enjoyable film.  My kids loved it, and I liked it a lot.  Recommended.",1270166400,13,2917,6.095354523227384
4835015,4,B005MQWJPG,"This movie was the perfect way to spend a rainy day with the entire family.  We have young boys who both loved it (we did too).  The storyline was great but I subtracted a star for the less then stellar 3D effects.  Technically, it met the requirements as it added depth to the movie but it lacked the gotcha factor of having something coming right out at you.  It has flying dragons people!  The 3D felt like it was added as an afterthought.

As for the movie itself, sit back and enjoy this tale of a thin young viking boy, Hiccup, who just doesn't fit in and it doesn't help that his father is the ruler of this Viking village.  It starts out with the villagers fighting off dragon attacks.  Hiccup has come up with a contraption to that shoots ropes and rocks to tangle dragons up and is determined to try it out on the deadliest dragon of all - the Night Fury.  To his surprise it works and he manages to capture a dragon but cannot find it in himself to kill the beast; instead, he finds a friend.  One who teaches him valuable lessons about dragons and himself.  Suddenly, the least likely to succeed ends up being the winner at Dragon Training School.  Having Astrid, a girl that Hiccup liked, becoming a side kick made for a few ""eewwws"" when she pecked Hiccup on the cheek but that's about it.

Hiccup tries to show his fellow Vikings that dragons are not the enemy and that there are bigger meaner beasts to fight.  He is not successful and his beloved dragon ends up being captured by the Vikings. Hiccup does his best to help his dragon friend with the help of other friends from Dragon School.

At the heart of this story is the question - are dragons good or bad?  We learn that some dragons are good and some are bad, just like everything else.  More important is the lesson that one should never prejudge.  This is proven when Hiccup is judged to be less ""Viking"" by his father and yet it is Hiccup who ends up determining their fate and not the strong leader.

As a parent, I enjoyed this movie and I know my kids did too.  The movie flew by at 98 minutes.  This movie is based on the popular book series with the same name.  After watching this film, my boys were eager to read the books (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Train-Your-Dragon-Book-1/dp/0316085278/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Train Your Dragon Book 1</a>) and I consider that a bonus.",1269907200,2,2416,4.569767441860465
4835016,5,B005MQWJPG,"After Shrek I had given up on buying DVDs of Dreamworks movies, but this one is worth the purchase.
[1] Storycraft:  Pixar always excels in achieving a finely honed storyline.  But in Dragon, the Dreamworks team finally focused more on the relationships:  between Hiccup the young Viking and the Night Fury dragon he befriends, between Hiccup and his father, and between Hiccup and the villagers--- and less on the gags.  It pays off.  The first few minutes are slightly chaotic, as if they were in a hurry to set the scene, but the rest flows seamlessly and you will feel transported to their world.  In this movie, Dreamworks did not rely on current cultural references for its gags (like the Puss in Boots in Shrek II telling the police that the catnip that fell out of his pocket was ""not mine."") Instead, the jokes are fun, plentiful and useful for carrying the plot along. (At this point I shall resist the temptation to spoil jokes from Dragon.)  Dragon will be fun to watch in DVD for years to come, as it will age well, appeal to both kids and adults, and not feel dated.
The final reason ""Dragon"" will take its place among the ""classics"" in your collection: in the end, because of what happens to Hiccup.  Not your usual ""happily ever after"" ending.  Again--no spoiler information here.  Suffice it to say, it takes the story a cut above the usual Dreamworks fare.
[2] Character development:  Dragon developed a wonderful array of dragons--who are really animals displaying lots of recognizable animal characteristics; and not people cast in creature costumes. Cat lovers, dog lovers, horse lovers, pet owners and animal lovers of all kinds will love these creatures.  Dreamworks did a fine job with the Hiccup, Astrid (the girl interest), and the rest villagers too, in particular the kids who start off as bullies to Hiccup.  In the end it is an imaginative, believable culture-- pro-environment and family friendly.
[3] Better than the flying scenes from ""Avatar.""  The flying scenes in each movie have their advantages, but while the flying scenes in Avatar culminated in a DRAMATIC moment, the multiple flying scenes in ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" score more ACTION.  Thumbs up to ""Dragon.""
I think the movie is best seen in IMAX or 3D but I also saw it in 2D and it was terrific.  I highly recommend the DVD.",1269734400,8,2324,4.758104738154613
4835017,4,B005MQWJPG,"I was hooked since the first time i saw the trailer. There were different types of dragons and awesome looking vikings, specially the leader of the vikings. It has many funny and touching moments, i'm anxiously waiting for the dvd. This is definitely the best i've seen form Dreamworks, they keep getting better and better. I took my family to see it and they all loved it. This is a keeper. It's not just for kids, i'm an adult and i love these types of films. I wonder what Dreamworks will do next...

VIKINGS AND DRAGONS RULE!!!",1269734400,,531,4.474226804123711
4835018,5,B005MQWJPG,"This film endeared itself to me from the moment I heard the name of the young hero - Hiccup! Yes, apparently, in Viking lore, the more unpleasant one's name, the greater the chances of avoiding trolls and all manner of unpleasantness. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a young Viking lad, who lives in an isolated Viking village far from the rest of civilization, and where most of the population is engaged in defending their village from marauding dragons of all kinds. Hiccup feels he is a disappointment to his father, Viking leader Stoick (voiced by Scotsman Gerard Butler) whose sole purpose in life is to kill dragons. Hiccup initially believes the way to his father's heart and that of a comely Viking lass, Astrid (America Ferrara), is to prove himself by killing a dragon. Since he possesses a small build, his only hope of killing a dragon is through ingenious means, and Hiccup invents a contraption that elicits derision from others, but one night, during a fierce dragon attack, Hiccup actually manages to catch a dragon. Unfortunately for Hiccup, the dragon disappears into the forest and no one believes him.

Later, Hiccup who has already been labeled a hopeless case by his peers and fellow villagers is compelled to enter dragon-fighting training - with fellow trainees Astrid, Fishlegs (Christopher Mintze-Plasse), Snotlout (Jonah Hill), and twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut (Kristen Wiig and T.J. MIller). This is also the time Hiccup discovers the missing dragon, which turns out to be of the Night Fury variety of dragon - so swift that never has one been captured and nothing is known of it.

The story moves along at a suitable pace and never lags - nor is it paced too fast. The story is allowed to develop as well as the characters- especially of the dragon ""Toothless"" and the boy Hiccup. The evolving relationship between dragon and boy is one of the sweetest highlights of the movie. The viewer gets to witness the slow progression from mistrust and suspicion (on the part of the dragon) and fear (on Hiccup's side) to gradual friendship, trust, and a deep, abiding sense of loyalty. The dragons featured in this film do not speak, which to me is a bonus - they convey their emotions through their eyes (and boy, does Toothless have a pair of expressive ones) and actions.

The dragons are a joy to watch - there are all sorts of varieties, from the clumsy, stocky ones to the long-necked, elegant ones, and truly ferocious, mean-looking ones. The twist halfway through the story kept the plot interesting and fresh. There's also a startling twist towards the end that challenges the traditional manner of approaching kid's movies (to say more would constitute a spoiler).

The humor is pitched at an appropriate level - kids will get most of it, and adults will find some amusing bits as well, though this is very much a kids' movie (no pop culture references here) and a movie for the kids in all of us. I loved the messages conveyed in this movie - that it's okay to be different, in fact marching to the beat of a different drum (as portrayed by Hiccup's character) is something desirable and not to be mocked at or belittled. The movie also provides educational insights - Hiccup's methods in gaining Toothless' trust and obedience is reminiscent of how humans train dogs/horses, and his various experiments in determining what repels dragons will encourage inquiry thinking in young children (great discussion point for parents and children here).
The concept of hands-on learning is prevalent throughout the movie. The themes of friendship, loyalty, and communication between parent and child are also strongly emphasized to good effect.

The effects are amazing - watching dragons in flight, especially in 3-D is pure poetry and the battle scenes are well done, without going over the top on the violent bits. The movie is rated PG for sequences of intense action and some scary scenes, and brief mild language. I did not find anything in this movie which was offensive, and we (husband and I) took our 5-year-old to watch it - all three of us enjoyed it immensely. The movie runs about 98 minutes. Final verdict - fun and wonderful entertainment for the entire family, and certainly worth splurging on the 3-D.",1269648000,,4243,4.854972375690608
4835019,4,B005MQWJPG,"In the tradition of some of our better animated films, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" establishes a thoroughly engaging friendship between a boy and an animal -- so engaging that we do in fact hurt when it appears that one or both is in grave danger. Animated films have always had that kind of power over audiences, maybe because an animal gives the filmmaker the perfect opportunity to convey emotions at their most fundamental. When they're happy, they're completely happy. When they're sad, they're completely sad. When they suffer, they express themselves so clearly that we suffer right along with them. It matters not that, in this case, the animal is a dragon, which doesn't exist; in the world of an animated film, entertainment tends to take precedence over reality.

The boy is a Viking teenager named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), an outcast amongst his people for being too short, too skinny, too clumsy, and too nonviolent in a village where dragon slaying is practically a religion. He thinks he wants nothing more than to be a mighty warrior, and for a good portion of time, he tries to get by in training, in which he's pitted against caged dragons in an arena of sorts. But after injuring and ensnaring a dragon all on his own -- an elusive and (supposedly) lethal kind, classified as Night Fury -- he finds he doesn't have the heart to kill it. He then befriends it, humorously dubbing it Toothless, and quickly realizes that his people have it all wrong: Dragons are not evil beasts that must be destroyed, but merely frightened creatures who are provoked into violence.

Toothless, who hides in a clearing beyond a waterfall, is large, graceful, majestic, and ever so slightly cute. This is good, not only for the children in the audience, but also because we need to care for him just as much as Hiccup does. And speaking of Hiccup, he's now faced with the task of leading a double life. To everyone else, including his crotchety trainer Gobber the Belch (voiced by Craig Ferguson), he seems to have transformed himself from a village disgrace into one of the best dragon fighters the people have ever seen. This doesn't sit too well with the tough, athletic, determined Astrid (voiced by America Ferrera), Hiccup's secret crush; she becomes increasingly suspicious of him, especially since his methods of subduing the dragons are not exactly what one would call violent.

Matters are further complicated by Hiccup's father, the brawny Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler), who up until now has always been disappointed in his son. Unfortunately, he has become proud for all the wrong reasons. He has yet to find out about Toothless, and he still doesn't understand that Hiccup has absolutely no intention of ever killing a dragon in battle. It's a classic case of the reluctant parent struggling to understand his child, of never listening to the child when he's trying to say something he feels is important.

Indeed, the general plot is a classic case, relying on themes of friendship, acceptance, and courage to get its point across. But what this movie lacks in original ideas it more than makes up for in heart, humor, and sheer visual spectacle, made stronger by its presentation in 3-D. Some of the film's most impressive scenes involve Hiccup riding on Toothless' back as he soars triumphantly above clouds, through craggy peaks, and over the sea; they're not merely stunning examples of camerawork and computer imagery, they're also exhilarating. And yes, there are a number of frenetic battle scenes, especially in the latter half of the film, at which point the Vikings are pitted against a monstrosity the likes of which no one has ever seen.

All this is in good fun. But for my money, the strongest element of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless, who against all odds became the best of friends. There is nothing here we haven't seen before, but can you honestly say you weren't touched at some level? The moment when Toothless is finally trusting enough to butt his head against Hiccup's hand made my heart glad. Maybe I'm too sentimental, but there you have it. There are also some genuinely funny moments involving Hiccup's attempts to feed Toothless, one of them ending in a less than appetizing way.

One could easily fault the minor details. Could any Viking, however muscular and well armed, physically defeat a gigantic winged reptile capable of breathing fire? Could anyone keep a large, noisy dragon a secret for as long as Hiccup did? Would no one have discovered the secret dragon nest long ago? If you think these questions are worth asking, you'd probably be better off seeing a different movie. ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" adapted from Cressida Cowell's book, is terrific family entertainment -- fun, heartfelt, and a pleasure to look at. Its greatest achievement is its ability to resonate emotionally, something all stories about unlikely friendships need in order to work. Without it, you'd have nothing more than a mindless action piece, with plenty to see but little to identify with.",1269561600,7,5086,4.887601390498262
4835020,5,B005MQWJPG,"I am an 18 year old girl and this seemed like any old kids movie with 3D animation. I wasn't particularly interested in it. However, my 13 year old sister was dying to see it so she took me with her to see it when it came out (today). I was thinking it was ok during most of it, but when it ended I left thinking it was an excellent movie. Normally I'm too lazy to write reviews on anything, even something I like, so it takes a lot for me to review something. Well, my thoughts on this movie.....I LOVED IT!!!

  I cannot comment on the DVD as it has not come out when I wrote this. I can however, comment on the film itself because I just came back from seeing it in the theater. I am not going to talk about the story because that is available on many other websites that have summaries or synopses(es) on the movie. Instead, I'm going to write what I think of it.

  This was very good for a children's movie however, there were some pretty PG things in it. For instance, the main character's father gives him a hat made from his mother's breastplate, and he ends up calling it the ""boob hat."" I thought that was an odd thing for little kids to watch. There is also a lot (but not too much) violence in this movie because dragons are mostly hunted and killed. This movie had lots of beautiful music throughout the film and makes it even more enjoyable. The creators were very creative when coming up with dragons to animate because I don't remember seeing the same type of dragon more than once (except a group of three smallish dragons that were no bigger than puppies).

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN A POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!

  The big dragon battle in the end was real exciting and what happened to the hero was surprising. I actually thought that was more realistic than other children's movies because it shows that the hero doesn't always make it out in one piece (if at all). Sure maybe evil (or whatever's bad) will fail in the end (eventually) but that doesn't mean the good guys will be in great shape afterwards. This may sound worse than what really happened but chill out, it's not so bad. Of course it has a happy ending. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just watch the movie. Trust me, it's great!

P.S.

  Just in case anyone's wondering. This is based on a book but from what I've read (I haven't read any of the books but I've read synopses' and such), the movie is really not much like it. There are many differences between the two. Just a heads up between those who have read it.",1269561600,10,2516,4.314225053078556

4835097,5,B005MQWJPG,"Vikings were never like this, but in an alternate universe, I hope they are.  The plot is just another version of that old chestnut a boy and his dog.  The boy (Jay Baruchel as Hiccup) dreams of dating (who knew Vikings dated!) a fierce competitor (America Ferrera as Astrid).  He wants to make his dad proud.  He has simple needs.  And while he is quite inventive making doodads and gizmos, they need him to be a dragon killer.  They also expect him to be the chief one day.  But.  There is a little hiccup in everyones plans..............a dragon named Toothless.  And a HUGE dragon aptly referred to as the Red Death.

A bit intense at times.  The anachronistic youth are a hoot, the grownups are not.  This should have won the Oscar for best animated feature but that went to Toy Story 3 instead.",1479600000,2,800,4.479166666666667

4835112,5,B005MQWJPG,"Fantastic animated film. This is one of my wife's favorites and she loved the follow up too. The story doesn't conform to all of the traditional standards and ideas of the children or animated genre. Without giving away any spoilers, the story centers around a Viking adolescent who knows he is very different from his father the chief of the village/tribe (voiced by Gerard Butler) in physical size, interest, desire to dominate dragons and demonstrates quite clearly that there is more than one way to skin a cat (deal with dragons).
The film is very well animated, the voice actors chosen well and if you let it will really draw you in from just viewing to feeling connected with the characters and the stories they tell.
I have a 5 month old son, and so I've started to think more and more about what is age appropriate. In this case, appropriate depends on your child's exposure to fast moving plot lines, willingness to be exposed to dragons (that could be perceived as 'scary) and the goals of many Vikings to capture and kill dragons. The twists in the plot lines with character and story development should hold the interest of smaller children. I'd be confident letting a child as young as 3-4 watch this as long as I was satisfied they could handle the aforementioned action",1472428800,,1285,4.6902654867256635

4835185,5,B005MQWJPG,"A surprisingly heartwarming and exciting film. I was skeptical of this film when it came out since I hadn't been satisfied with anything Disney has produced in the way of animated films lately, so I was skeptical of Dreamworks studio, as they have always appeared to play second fiddle to Disney.

On one off night, I took a chance on this film from a local DVD rental near my home. Then, I watched the sequel on Netflix. Then, I watched both again the next morning. And then, finally, I bought both from Amazon. HTTYD is one of the best children's movies to see the silver screen in recent years, and the mesmerizing relationship that builds between Hiccup and Toothless brings back feelings of childhood amazement and wonder that you might have forgotten existed. This film is well-scored, well-written, with a great ensemble cast of voice talent and breath-taking animated scenes of flight and action that form a truly incredibly story.

If you haven't seen this film before, I MUST recommend that you watch it, and if you have seen it before, then what exactly are you waiting for? Go ahead and add it to your collection!",1454457600,,1125,4.73469387755102

This kid is basically the laughing stock of his village. But when he shoots down a legendary dragon and nobody believes him, then subsequently beforehand the dragon and process everyone wrong...he becomes a bit of a local celebrity. It's a lot like a classic underdog story. Always nice to see the low guy on the totem pole come out shining like a star! I loved the story about Hiccup and his friends and how he, in a weird way, showed people that dragons didn't have to be the enemy...they they could actually be domesticated and be somewhat like friends.

4835317,5,B005MQWJPG,"For years now DreamWorks Animation has almost always been a step behind Pixar, with the occasional ""Shrek"" making some inroads but not usually matching the sheer heart Pixar always puts into its pictures.  So it's a pleasure to see DreamWorks come up with one that matches practically anything Pixar has made.  That would be 2010's ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" one of the best films of the year.

OK, I admit I didn't have high hopes for it going in, despite my having heard that a lot of people liked it (I looked it up and found at the time of this writing it was the eighth biggest-grossing film of 2010).  Maybe it was the corny-sounding title that put me off.  I had no idea the filmmakers based the movie on a best-selling book of the same name by Cressida Cowell.  Title aside, the film is as cute, sweet, funny, exciting, and touching as anything you'll find.

The story takes place in Medieval Scandinavia in the little Viking village of Berk, which the main character describes as ""twelve days north of hopeless and a few degrees south of freezing to death.""  The main character is Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), a young fellow the townsfolk would rather keep out of sight because he's small and hapless, and they're all big and strong and capable.  And everyone else enjoys killing dragons, one of the citizenry's main occupations, and Hiccup is rather reluctant and inept at it.  Poor Hiccup is, in fact, the laughing stock of the town.

Stoick (Gerard Butler) is the strapping huge, bellowing chief of the tribe, who fights dragons with his bare hands.  The dragons in the neighborhood are plentiful, and the Vikings spend a lot of their time fending them off or hunting them down.  Oh, and Stoick is also Hiccup's father, something that grieves Stoick no end.  Like father not like son.

Stoick and the villagers, including Gobber (Craig Ferguson), the blacksmith for whom Hiccup works as an apprentice, expect Hiccup to kill dragons; it's what all the young guys and girls in the village do when they're old enough:  They go to dragon-fighting school and learn to slay dragons.  That, however, is the last thing Hiccup wants to do.  Among Hiccup's classmates are Astrid (America Ferrera), a feisty young lady who becomes a rival and a romantic interest; Snotlout (Jonah Hill), a big, dim-witted lug; Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plausse), Tuffnut (T.J. Miller) and Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig).

The plot centers on Hiccup accidentally ensnaring the most fearsome of dragons, a Night Fury, one evening, and a few days later finding it in the forest tangled in Hiccup's rope and missing the part of its tail that acts as a rudder when it's flying.  Although Hiccup knows he should kill the beast while it's defenseless, he also knows he cannot.  He frees the creature instead, and helps build him a new tail, for which the dragon is eternally grateful.  It seems dragons aren't such bad animals after all.

From this point on, the friendship between Hiccup and the dragon, whom Hiccup names ""Toothless"" because it has retractable teeth, resembles a variation on the old Aesop fable of ""Androcles and the Lion.""  We can pretty much see what's coming, but we can enjoy it all the same.  Toothless turns out to be quite smart, learning fast, and before long in their relationship we have to wonder who is training whom.

Yes, there is a good deal of sentiment in the movie, yet the sentimentality never turns sappy.  Yes, there is a degree of violence in the film, yet while the action is exhilarating, it is never too intense for younger viewers.  And, yes, there are morals, life lessons, applied, yet they are never excessive or preachy.  The filmmakers temper the movie's ingredients just enough to make the balance acceptable to everyone.

""How to Train Your Dragon"" is fun, funny, stirring, poignant, and all things a good, wholesome family film should be.  The 3-D CGI animation is gorgeous--vivid and alive with intricate detail, shadows, color, and depth.  It's a joy to watch.  What's more, the movie is humorous without being crude or demeaning.  A father-son talk between Stoick and Hiccup is moving and amusing at the same time, and a climactic battle is as thrilling as any action sequence you'll see in any picture anywhere.  In fact, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is delightful and appealing, rousing and friendly, and it's thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.

""Everything we know about dragons is wrong.""

Video:
The DreamWorks video engineers catch all of the film's grandeur and beauty using an MPEG-4 codec and a dual-layer BD50 for some of the most-stunning high-definition imagery you'll find on Blu-ray.  The HD reproduction of the 2.35:1 ratio picture is as good as anything I've seen from any studio, DreamWorks or Pixar.  The colors are rich, deep, and strong; the blacks are inky dark; the definition is precise; and there are absolutely no traces of digital artifacts, noise, or manipulation.  The PQ is simply first-class, as good as it gets.

Audio:
The lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio almost matches the picture quality in its breathtaking scope, although John Powell's musical track (which is quite good) and the peripheral sounds come close to overwhelming the dialogue on occasion.  There are not only wide dynamics involved, a broad frequency range, and a strong impact, there is a wonderful use of the surrounds as well, from the film's musical ambience to its pinpoint aural effects.  The whole soundtrack really comes into its own and proves its worth in the final twenty minutes or so; wait for it.  Of course, there is always regular Dolby Digital for people unable to play the lossless TrueHD track.

Extras:
The Blu-ray disc comes loaded with extras, most of them exclusive to Blu-ray.  The first item is a sixteen-minute bonus film, ""Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon,"" where the characters from the movie set sail on a new adventure, done up mostly in 3-D CGI animation like the original, with some segments of 2-D to fill in gaps.  Following that is ""Viking-Sized Cast,"" eleven minutes with the filmmakers and voices behind the animated characters.  Then, there is ""Technical Artistry of Dragon,"" ten minutes on the computer graphics involved.

After that are three deleted scenes in rough-draft form, with director's introductions.  That's followed by ""The Story Behind the Story,"" a seven-minute look at bringing author Cressida Cowell's book to the screen; ""Racing for the Gold,"" segments of Winter Viking Olympics; a short bit on ""How to Draw a Dragon""; a question-and-answer session about yourself in ""Your Viking Profile""; a full-feature commentary with co-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois and producer Bonnie Arnold; ""The Animators' Corner,"" a full-feature picture-in-picture affair with the filmmakers discussing things, showing you storyboards, and providing behind-the-scenes footage as you watch the film; a full-feature Trivia Track with pop-up pieces of information about the movie as you go along; and a DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox where you can play music from other DW animated films.

Next, we get a series of bonus items labeled ""Keep Out!""  Here, you'll find previews of coming attractions in theaters and on disc; several games from previous DreamWorks releases; and some promos for ""Shrek the Musical.""  Finally, there are seventeen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; English audio description; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles, and English captions for the hearing.

The bonuses wrap up with a second disc, a DVD edition of the film with a filmmakers' commentary, a ""Viking-Sized Cast,"" and ""Technical Artistry of Dragons.""

Parting Thoughts:
""How to Train Your Dragon"" catches all the spirit of good high adventure and combines it with poignancy and humor, producing a picture the whole house can enjoy.  Believe me, it's not just another children's film, but, rather, it's in the tradition of the best Disney cartoons, something both old and young can equally appreciate.  With the Blu-ray disc's superb picture and sound, it's also a joy just to look at and listen to, making it an experience every videophile and every movie lover can enjoy.  I know I did.",1433548800,,8222,5.021386430678466

4835325,4,B005MQWJPG,"Somewhere along the way, my life got busier than it used to be, and the activity that has dropped off is trips to the movies.  Thats why I am just now catching 2010s computer animated movie How to Train Your Dragon despite all the glowing reviews Ive heard about it.  And it was certainly enjoying.

The movie introduces us to Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel).  Hiccup is a Viking, but hes the smallest and scrawniest of all.  His village is regularly attacked by dragons, and he longs to go out and fight them, but every time he does, he gets in the way.

Then one day two things happen.  First, he actually captures one, but instead of killing it, he lets it go and even befriends it.  Then he is offered a chance to be trained to fight dragons.  Does he still want to fight dragons?

I thought I knew where this story was going early on, and I pretty much did.  In fact, in the early stages, I found the execution so predictable that I was just a little bored.

But somewhere along the way, I began to really care for Hiccup and Toothless (the dragon hes befriended).  I wanted them to have a happy ending.  And at that point, I was very invested in the story and didn't care how predictable it was.  I was having fun.

Speaking of fun, there were some scenes that were so pleasant I had a smile on my face.  Not to say that the entire film was that way.  Some scenes near the end are rather dark, easily earning the film its PG rating.  I did enjoy the story they told, so Im not criticizing, just warning that the film isn't all fun and games.

As with many Dreamworks films, the animation is good in a stylized way.  Im not just talking about the characters who are fine for an animated film.  There is a look to their films that never quite lets you forget that you are watching something that was created on a computer.  Still, they manage to sneak in a few truly breathtaking shots, especially one late in the film involving fog.

The voice acting is great.  Jay Baruchel has to pretty much carry the film since there are many scenes that are just him.  The cast is filled out by Gerald Butler, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Robin Atkins, Downes, and Kristen Wiig.  They all do a great job, and its easy to forget who you are listening to and enjoy the characters they are creating.

While the story started out familiar, I got caught up in the fun that is How to Train Your Dragon.  If youve missed it, make a point of watching this enjoyable flick.",1432684800,2,2457,4.291938997821351

4835594,1,B005MQWJPG,"Didn't do much for me. The animation isn't bad, but the story is just predictable and, to be honest, these really don't look like what you'd expect from dragons - in fact, the main character's dragon looks more like a large bat. The hero character is also something of a brat. I realize I'm in a minority on this one and probably won't score many agreements but I don't care. There are better animated films than this one.",1419120000,3,422,4.423076923076923

Amazon showed me a vendor that would sell it for $9.95 and that was just right.  The film itself is your classic coming of age story with the twist of a Viking teen who doesn't fit in according to Dad, the head warrior.  The graphics are great with really good sound.

The DVD/BD itself came with the extra footage, but the digital code did not allow consumers to watch the extra footage (like with the 2nd movie purchase). The code only allowed viewing of the movie itself, which was a little sad. Just in case people were wondering what you'd get when you buy this product.

Of course, these are just my opinions...they are worth exactly what you paid for them.",1413936000,,337,4.403225806451613

4835695,4,B005MQWJPG,"A decent CGI children's actioner with just a couple of quibbles;

1)  Vikings didn't have Scot's accents.
2)  Vikings didn't have horns on their helmets (that was the Visigoths, and they sacked Rome)

Having said that, this is actually a darn good movie experience.  Aimed at kids there's a lot of sappy moments that actually put a smile on my face.  The dragon itself, the main dragon character that is, is a cross between a black cat and a flying lizard, and maybe a little puppy dog too.

I don't have much to say about this film other than you don't need to see it in 3D.  It works just as well as a normal movie going experience.  The characters are decent enough, and the character design is also excellent to fit the voices, and vice versa for the casting.  Major kudos to lead Jay Baruchel, and the animators who storyboarded and skethed out the scenes before animating them.

A very respectable CGI toon experience.  Great stuff.",1413849600,,938,4.550898203592815

4835728,4,B005MQWJPG,"Given Dreamworks Animations reputation for mediocre cartoons, I ignored the first How to Train Your Dragon when it came out in theaters. When I later saw the kinds of reviews that it got, though, I regretted that choice. It just so happened that a nearby theater held a double-feature of both the first and it sequel. Naturally I got a ticket for myself and attended that double-feature.

How to Train Your Dragon is about a Viking village that has withstood attacks from dragons for generations. A chieftains son gradually tames a rare black dragon. The graphics and animation are impressive. Actually, it looks truly great in 3Dit was rightly praised a shining example when 3D movies were revived at the start of this decade. Frankly, its among the best 3D that Ive seen in terms of fullness and depth, so if you have the equipment find the 3D version by all means. The storys basic structure looks like a typical spiel of a boy and his animal. Its very well-done, though. The characters are memorable and there is real emotion.",1410739200,,1030,4.722222222222222

4835858,5,B005MQWJPG,"With ""How to Train Your Dragon"", DreamWorks really shows that not only can they rival Disney and Pixar, but they can also surpass them.

I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel like too many people have not seen this film.  It's a masterpiece.  DreamWorks has hit a grand slam with this one.  Not to say they don't make quality animated films, because I have affection for ""Shrek"", ""Kung Fu Panda"" and even ""Megamind"", but this is a special animated film.  The first company we think of when we think of animated films is Disney of course, with all their classics, but DreamWorks has really stepped up as a legitimate rival, and this is their strongest product.

How to Train Your Dragon is a story about a young boy and dragon befriending one another after being bitter enemies and change the way their world works in the midst of becoming heroes.  There's obviously more to it, but typing it up just doesn't do it justice.  It's the character development, the voice acting, the music, cinematography and the beautiful animation that will make your jaw drop, all enveloping a strong story that will leave you misty-eyed.  But it's not just a cutesy film.  DreamWorks courageously throws in some dark elements that very few animated films really venture into.  And it makes for a more complete feeling by the time the credits roll.  So they get more kudos for that.

It's not an overly silly movie compared to other recent animated films and the humor is more dry, but this film has it all.  It's from the creative team who gave us ""Lilo and Stitch"" and it shows drastically, especially with the main dragon character, named Toothless.  If you are looking for a more comedic film like ""Shrek"" you might be a tad disappointed, but I think this film's emotional punch would still leave even those people satisfied.

A lot of noise has been made recently with films like ""Tangled"", ""Toy Story 3"", and ""Frozen"". Those are all great films.  But I think to put it simply: How to Train Your Dragon is better than each of them.  Toy Story 3 had a lot of nostalgia working for it, and Frozen is a very good story, but as a whole combination of everything you can want in a film, I got to stand by my guns.",1404259200,,2197,4.505050505050505
4835859,5,B005MQWJPG,"I actually watched this movie twice before realizing how good it was. Admittedly the first time I watched it I was skeptical since it was not a Pixar or Disney movie so I did not pay full attention to it.  Lo and behold my surprise when I watched it again a few years later and realized how much detail went into each dragon and how endearing Toothless was.  He's not the prettiest or cutest thing but his behavior, facial and body expressions make you want to have one of your own.  And since I am all about animal rescue, adding dragon rescue to the list was only logical.  There are plenty of laughs and if you listen closely you realize how much good humor was written into the script.  Gotta hate it when it's axe return time... Anyway, I am officially obsessed and it is now my go-to feel good movie.",1404172800,,806,4.311258278145695

4835894,5,B005MQWJPG,"The story of Hiccup and Toothless is one of the best that I have seen. DreamWorks reaches a depth rarely seen in its films, as it explores the longing to belong, to be loved. Hiccup wants to be a real Viking, but all that he does ends up as failure, and shames his father, the one person he wants desperately to please. But Hiccup learns that he is a Viking, and one of the best.

With amazing scenery and breathless flight scenes, this movie makes you feel like you're right there on Toothless, flying with Hiccup. The animation is stunning, and there is no language or crude humor. There are a few mentions of Viking deities, and lots of Dragon-to-Dragon or Viking-on-Dragon violence, with big explosions and plenty of fireballs. This is an action movie, but the heart in it is easy to see. That, coupled with the beautiful music and colorful characters, makes this movie of a lonely boy looking for a friend one that you will want to see again and again.",1400457600,,957,4.5

4835898,5,B005MQWJPG,"I begin this review with a disclaimer -- I have not read the ""How To Train Your Dragon"" books.  Normally I will pass on a movie until I have read the book it is based on (such as ""Holes""), or will hunt down and read the book once I learn a particular movie is an adaptation (such as ""The Never-Ending Story"" or ""The Last Unicorn"").  And in most cases I find the book superior.  However, I'm also a HUGE dragon enthusiast, and so I opted to watch the movie in theaters before reading the books.  I already knew that the movie would probably be very different from the books, but I figured even if the movie bombed, it would still be fun to watch the dragons in action.

I still haven't read the books... but the movie remains one of my favorite animated movies of all time, and I eagerly await the sequel.

Hiccup is a scrawny blacksmith's assistant in the village of Berk, a Viking town that's frequently besieged by fire-breathing dragons who burn down houses, steal livestock, and otherwise make life difficult for the inhabitants.  While Hiccup's father, Chief Stoick the Vast, plans an attack that should keep the dragons away from Berk forever, Hiccup tries to improve his miserable standing in the village by killing a dragon of his own.  His efforts go awry, and he instead ends up befriending an injured dragon, a mysterious Night Fury named Toothless.  Over time he comes to learn and understand more about his reptilian friend and others of his kind, and learns that much of what the Vikings think they know about dragons is wrong.  But when the village plans an assault against the dragons' home, one that could have devastating consequences for Viking and dragon alike, it's up to Hiccup, Toothless, and the rough-and-tumble Viking girl Astrid to stop the attack and unite humankind and dragonkind... before an even worse threat than the dragons is set free.

DreamWorks has been somewhat infamous for making films that rely too much on pop culture references, gross-out humor, and cheap slapstick -- the ""Shrek"" films, ""Madagascar"" films, and ""Shark Tale"" were particularly infamous in this regard.  ""How To Train Your Dragon"" does have some slapstick and bodily-function humor (with the infamous ""hat scene"" being the most notable), but for the most part it draws much of its humor from snarky wit and situational humor, and it doesn't fall back on quickly-dated pop culture references to be funny or to appeal to adults.  This is a refreshing turn for DreamWorks, and a trend they seem to be continuing with in their more recent films, such as ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""Rise of the Guardians.""

The characters are fun bunch as well.  Many kids will identify with Hiccup's quest to fit in, and his fascination with the world around him and his willingness to learn and adapt are great character traits.  The other Viking kids and teens are a varied bunch -- obnoxiously arrogant Snoutlout, nerdy and scaredy-cat Fishlegs, warrior girl Astrid, and the rude and ever-bickering twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut -- but help provide some memorably funny scenes.  Stoick and Gobber are the only notable adults in the film, but they're strong and even sympathetic characters, and its hard not to like them.  And Toothless, despite having no actual dialogue, is a great character all his own, the right mix of awesome and adorable and with some of the best facial expressions in the film.

The animation in this film is spectacular as well, right up there with Pixar's best.  The dragons are all imaginatively designed, some spiky and toothy, some streamlined and sleek, and some chubby and knobbly.  Someone had a LOT of fun designing these beasties, and many of them look to be direct homages to the illustrations from the original books.  And the flight scenes in the movie are incredibly done, with fantastic visuals and amazing camera tricks.  This movie must have been a blast to see in 3D...

One of DreamWorks' best films, this is an amazing movie, and even if it's vastly different from the books it's still well worth your time.  I just hope the sequel is good too...  Best for ages 8 and up due to some violent sequences.",1399420800,,4126,4.751753155680224

4835901,5,B005MQWJPG,"I love this film, not only for its high quality animation, but its story, characters, setting, and its message. There is not I can say that hasn't been said by others. I especially like the idea of a isolated colony of Vikings on a remote island where they set up their own community and traditions. The idea of the nerdy screw up outcast becoming a hero is a cliche done too often, but the idea of a dragon being a pet and a workhorse for the settlement is interesting. The whole settlement learns better and not to fear and hunt dragons, but to use as pets and transportation. I especially enjoyed the character of Astrid as a brave warrior-to-be, who first is contemptuous of Hiccup, but after some time grows to love him. Also her outfit, including the belt of skulls hints at a fierceness within her that is appealing. No passive women in this film. This heroic fantasy film creates a new breakthrough in high quality animation and a strong story that is enchanting, exciting, and rewarding. The setting of the film is also very interesting and different from other films. I also note that the dragon Hiccup captures is given cats' eyes, in fact the dragon seems to me to be a playful flying cat that resembles a reptile in appearance. An excellent film overall.",1398643200,,1267,4.58590308370044
4835902,5,B005MQWJPG,"Very cute and adorable. I love the relationship that grows between the two. The animation is amazing; I can't wait for the sequel! I would most definitely recommend this movie to people of all ages, because it definitely worth a watch.",1398643200,,235,4.7560975609756095
4835903,4,B005MQWJPG,I have been adding more animations to my collection of late and we enjoy this one quite a bit.

4835909,5,B005MQWJPG,"I will admit I loved this movie when I first watched it. I totally fell in love with Toothless. Such a cute dragon. I want one. I did name my pet Bearded Dragon after Toothless from the Movie.

Ok so this movie about a boy who first injures a dragon, becomes best friends with the same dragon. Saves the tribe, becomes a hero and changes everyone's mind about dragons.

If you read the book by Cressida Cowell you will know this movie is nothing like the book, some of the characters names are there, Berk is there, Hiccup is still there and still unlikely Viking. Toothless is a lot bigger than in the book. A lot less Whiny. Hiccup is a better Viking than in the book. He is picked on by the bigger Viking boys.

So the movie is still awesome, even if really the only thing that came from the book is some of the characters names and a couple of dragons and the Vikings of Berk. It is a fun story for all ages, great family movie. I highly recommend it. I am anxiously awaiting the next movie myself. I hope it is as good as the first.",1397606400,,1037,4.149253731343284

4835976,5,B005MQWJPG,"Going into HtTYD, I was quite skeptical about the whole affair.  Being more of a Horror-Movie buff than anything else, I don't really expect much out of other genres - although, to be fair, I don't expect much out of Horror either.  Few movies have the kind of insight; synthesis of talent; and stellar presentation to win me over; and if you compound this general statement of artistic scarcity with a marked lack of even the most petty of scares, I'm usually ready to not watch and say that I did.  Well, this happens to be one of the occasions where I'm glad I was talked into watching.  Despite a silly, somewhat childish approach to the topic (although this was almost necessary, and actually lent the movie its charm), HtTYD does what few movies manage to do: it engaged me on an emotional level.  Indeed, even having watched this movie once before, I still found myself reacting as if I'd never seen it before - an unusual event for any artistic endeavor.
  Story-wise, from the standpoint of the generally accepted ""NO SPOILERS"" rule, there's not much to tell: Vikings kill dragons (like they do); boy meets dragon; boy saves everyone because of dragon.  But this simplicity does nothing to detract from the experience, as it's character interaction and dedication to the roles that wins the day on this venture.  Despite humor that ranges from goofy to pre-adolescent, never once did I feel myself becoming disengaged from the spectacle.  No one character is overbearing or underwhelming; and all of the actors manage to pull their roles together in a way that does nothing but show this gem for what it really is.  In short, and without being too mushy (which I doubt I could stand for more than a picosecond), the film does so much right as to make me promote it as a family classic.
  For those of you with a serous case of TLDR: good presentation and good acting turn a silly movie into a charming one that managed to make my day without even one drop of blood spilled - impressive for a bunch of Vikings.  I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone, particularly if you have young children.",1388188800,,2109,4.634408602150538

4835978,5,B005MQWJPG,"I have enjoyed a few of the recent 3D animated movies from Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks, such as ""Toy Story"", ""Cars"", and ""Shrek"". For me, their appeal has always been in their comedy. The few more serious movies of that style usually bored me and I couldn't really get into them. But the title of this one was, naturally, appealing to a fantasy lover such as as myself. I had kept the movie in the back of my mind and finally saw it not too long ago when a friend of mine recommended it.

What a cute and lovely film! The story is so sweet and in a lot of ways, pretty original. If you're anything like me, you were probably expecting some sort of ""Eragon"" rip-off (which would be kind of strange as ""Eragon"" itself could be considered a rip-off anyway). But that isn't the case. The story is not one of a revival of ancient magic or of defeating an ancient enemy to return to the old way of doing things - there is no magic other than the existence of dragons (which I suppose could be considered magical in some ways), and until Hiccup and Toothless a human's friendship with a dragon is a completely unheard-of thing in Berk. The focus of the story isn't on some great enemy that must be defeated, but on the main character's journey to discover himself and find acceptance as he is.

Another unique aspect is the way the dragons were designed; none of them look even remotely like most people imagine or depict dragons at all, and each species was very different from the others. I enjoyed that. It's fun to see something different. All of the animation was great, some of it even a bit jaw-dropping for me because of how real it looked.

The score is epic and beautiful, with a celtic sound to it. The acting is also great, and despite having a more serious plot, there are actually a lot of funny moments in the film.

I don't dislike every Disney film, but the more animated movies I watch from other companies, the more I realize how much Disney's usually fall short. Dreamworks really outdid themselves with this one, and it's definitely worth watching over and over again.",1388016000,2,2082,4.456692913385827

4835984,5,B005MQWJPG,"So I had no issues that I saw in the one-two-three star reviews. Some complaints called it boring. Well, it opens with a dragon attack on a village. Um. That's dull? To whom? I am a huge adult fan of animated features, and this may have needed some help with fleshing out a few things---but it's intended for kids. That is, people who can't really sit through 3-hour-long tour de force performances by Oscar-caliber (or Oscar-wannabe) actors. Is it ""The King's Speech""? No. And while I know this isn't exactly ""Citizen Kane"", it is one of the top animated films I've seen in a long life. I own it. That says a lot. I'd have given it 4 1/2 stars if the option existed, but rounded up. It's *fun*. We need that. But if you have VERY YOUNG KIDS? No. I'd say ten and up. To be safe.

NOTE: TO those criticizing the ""bad Scottish"" accents? Gerard Butler (voice of Stoick the Vast) is Scottish. So saying ""Get someone better"" is a puzzle to me.",1387497600,,938,4.36

Unfortunately the rest of the village, and his own father, still see Dragons as something to be feared, battled and killed and it is up to Hiccup to change that mindset.",1383436800,,614,4.572727272727272

4836020,5,B005MQWJPG,"I recently saw the movie again, and the emotions I felt when I saw it the first time in the cinema resurfaced and prompted me to write this review =)

I have to say that I arrived to the cinema with really low expectations of the film. I'm an adult and I've always hated Dream Works movies (Shrek, Madagascar...), so I really was expecting odd jokes that don't make me laugh and forced plots. But Boy was I surprised!

I was pulled inside the film from the first minutes and enjoyed a ride with Hiccup, Toothless and everyone else!
The animation is awesome, something that I really enjoyed about it are the small details, like the freckles on the Vikings faces or the little scar in Hiccup's chin, it made them seem real.

--------SPOILERS*******************

The flying sequence with Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless is really something pulled out of a dream, you really get to feel what it's like to ride a dragon, and at the same time it makes you feel nostalgic that it's not real. The score accompanying this scene wraps everything in a perfect environment to make you soar along the characters.

As most of you have commented, the ending of the movie really made the whole audience gasp, including me. This special bond that now Hiccup and Toothless share was beautifully done for a children movie (and really any kind of movie). I kind of expected it after Gobber's comment, but I really didn't expect it to be really included. But it was just perfect. It has opened the gate to something we rarely see, a human hero, disabled and with limitations we all humans face.

Seeing this boy that everyone avoided be able to prove that he is capable of achieving his goals is what makes this movie so special, to see him struggle and grow as we all have to do someday. Of course that having Toothless by his side makes it even better!

I can't wait to see the development of these characters in the sequels!",1380758400,,1903,4.546783625730995

SPOILER ALERT

The only thing that I've noticed with kid's movies (especially now days), is the mature content. For this movie, it was Hiccup losing his leg. On one end it was ""cute"" because Hiccup and Toothless sort of match each other in injury and become each other's better half, but on the other hand it made me question how a child would/ should interpret that.

4836084,5,B005MQWJPG,"Well Just to be frank, This is a great movie for the entire family. I am not a big fan of Dreamworks (excluding Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Over The Hedge, and now this) but I must admit, this movie really took me by surprise.

Jay Baruchel plays the main character Hiccup;the funny thing is, I can relate to his character. I myself know what it is like to feel like you can't make the people closest to you or the people around you proud. Gerard Butler brings the mighty force he had in 300 to voice Hiccup's father Stoick who is ruler over the vikings, he did a good job. America Ferrera plays Astrid the fearless girl who Hiccup has a crush on, Jonah Hill stars as Snotlout, Hiccup's cousin, Craig Ferguson portrays Gobber, and Christopher Mintz Plasse stars as the know it all about dragons, Fishlegs. The Cast was excellent

Another thing I happen to find surprising and worth mentioning is the film itself is really deep for a kid's movie, no I mean SERIOUSLY it is. Maybe I feel that way because the title character is more relatable for myself; I do not know. Toy Story 3 is the only animated film I can remember actually crying at, and although this movie does not exactly bring tears, it does have just as much emotion and a strong positive influence behind it.

How To Train Your Dragon is not only smart, but is one of the more visually impressive, creative movies I have seen when it comes to animation. And as of now, I find dragons extremely awesome and if I had one, I just might name it Toothless.

The dragons were also a jumping off point for imaginative play. Doesn't everyone love dragons? The characters provided lots of references for imaginative play.

As for the movie itself, the animation is very well done. The storyline connects with kids. The acting is good. This is a movie that the kids watch over and over again and often reference either in play or to make some point in real life.

Yes, that's the giant turtle monster from one of the Greek-myth movies (I get the stories mixed up; the directors seem to, too). But we all love how animators draw tributes and slip in thousands of little jokes and references. Some of the most beautiful landscape matte painting you'll see outside a gallery.

4836115,4,B005MQWJPG,"Have you ever felt like a disappointment to everyone you know? Someone your parents and peers think of as an anchor dragging the rest of them down or as a mere inconvenience? How do you get past that?

  Berk is a small, Viking village located near the Arctic Circle. At least, that's an assumption I made based on the main character's statement that ""it snows nine months of the year and hails the other three"". That main character, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is the only son of the village chief, Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler). The village is under near-constant siege by outside forces. Those outside forces being dragons. Hiccup (Baruchel) is short, slim, and in no way strong. The one trade all villagers learn in their lifetime is the art of hunting and killing dragons. Gobber (Hiccup's employer and the proprietor of the village armory, voiced by Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup stop all of ""this"" while gesturing to all of him. Gobber (Ferguson) is a man who has lost several limbs over the years, all during encounters with dragons. Hiccup, being seriously lacking in physical strength, designs and constructs a machine to propel the weapons that the other villagers simply throw by hand. Of course, during a trial run in front of Gobber, the machine strikes a villager. Hiccup takes that same apparatus to a mountaintop, fires on one of the few species of dragon that's never been captured or seen and, miraculously, causes that dragon to fall to earth. Overjoyed by this victory, Hiccup shouts in triumph but is soon set upon by a species of dragon that can breathe fire and produce fire throughout its entire body. He's rescued by his father who expresses disappointment in his son and disbelief in Hiccup's claim to have landed a blow against a Night Fury. He treks through the woods the next day, determined to find proof of his accomplishment, but finds something far more significant.

  Now, unlike a lot of ""adults"" I maintain my affection for ""children's"" movies. This is not to say that I like all, or even most, children's movies. For example, Despicable Me, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and Eight Crazy Nights disappointed me to a degree that I cannot express in words. But, in spite of its flaws or maybe because of them, I loved How to Train Your Dragon. Casting Baruchel as Hiccup was genius. Hiccup's peers, voiced by Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, America Ferrara and others, fit the roles they're given perfectly. If you have children who haven't seen this movie, you should take steps to remedy that.

Now whether or not both (or either!) are listening and hear the message is case-by-case -- but this is an example of a movie that addresses issues of both.  Rather than spoil it for you with a blow-by-blow, suffice it to say, in this movie Dad is Mr. Stud, an overachiever who is also overprotective of his less-than-studley son, and son doesn't comprehend the vast love behind all the bluster and expectations of his father.  Through the course of the movie and the circumstances that unfold, both come to realize that they are better together -- that both were wrong -- and that the combination of being the best you can be as well as extending grace to those who seem to march to the beat of a different drummer, will help a person get a clearer picture of what real love looks like.

4836180,5,B005MQWJPG,A very funny warm hearted film about a young man whose interactions with the dragons in his Viking village do not mesh well with his parents' generation. Turns out dragons may not be so bad after all. Very well done action scenes. And the movie shows that one does not have to be the largest and strongest kid to accomplish great deeds.,1364515200,,336,4.435483870967742

4836182,5,B005MQWJPG,"First of all, this movie was a sleeper for me in 2010, but by the time I saw it, it was in 2-D only. Still, loved the humor, pacing, heart and the deft way it combined visuals with a sweeping musical score. I think I held my breath during the first viewing of ""Test Drive.""

The 3-D version does a good job, I think, though I don't consider myself any sort of expert on home 3-D. But the kids and I enjoyed the heck out of it on a 42-inch LG passive screen with Sony 3-D Bluray player.

Mostly the 3-D is nicely done. In a few fast moving scenes (the aforementioned Test Drive) it fails a bit, but these were not prolonged or particularly distracting deficits.

If this is a limitation of home systems, or my system for that matter, would love to hear how people address it. Would also like to see the cost of 3-D disc come down a little, but for me, this disc was worth it.",1364083200,,874,4.099415204678363

4836190,5,B005MQWJPG,"Dreamworks is just amazing. Disney Pixar does not hold a candle to them. (And after disney is screwing up things with Marvel and Star Wars, I love giving money to their competitor.) This is quite possibly my favorite movie ever. I suggest you watch it, all three short movies, and the entire TV show before you see the second movie on June 20, 2014. It is so worth.

Plot:
The plot is fantastic. It never gets dry; it never gets boring. I've watched it three nights in a row. They drop a couple of one-liners that really make me happy. (i.e. ""First to ride one though."") I love how the adults all have Scottish accents and the kids don't. They symbolization is uncanny.

Casting:
Whereas Jay Baruchel's voice is perfect for the main protagonist, I could help but notice that it did not quite fit Hiccup's demeanor. I don't think they should have recasted Baruchel, but possibly redesigned Hiccup? That being said, the cast was fantastic, perfect even. There were a couple that were much better than expected. America Ferrera played the blonde-haired, feisty heartthrob very well; I did not expect this because she is the opposite. (Not that she's ugly, but she's not, looks or personality, anything like Astrid.) Jonah Hill had my favorite line of the movie. He was hilarious! And getting Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson was genius. The only two famous Scots in America being in this movie was really the only thing they could have done.

So if you're wondering if you should buy this movie, do it.  I promise you will not regret it. You'll probably have a new favorite movie.",1363392000,,1577,4.682310469314079

I can watch all up til that point (literally only about a second or two of the movie) with a problem, but when I get to this point; I can't do anything except skip to the next chapter and rewind to the point where it freezes. The movie then continues throughout the end like nothing is wrong.
Overall, a good buy just because I love the movie, but because of that little issue; it is only good instead of great.

4836199,5,B005MQWJPG,"We had the normal Blu-ray version since its first release and the kids and adults both love the movie.
Since we have a decent system that allows us to watch 3D now, we thought why not upgrade and give our old disc to friends.
We charged up the LG Glasses, got everyone their juice and sat down for some saturday night fun.
The 3D images were entertaining and engaged the whole family. knowing the storyline gave us a good heads up and a way to compare the two discs.
Sound track was fairly similar. As in I could not tell any differences, except to see how the 3D images matched up better with sound track making the experience more engaging.

The kids thought the 3D version was better and their parents a heroes.
no one suffered any headaches or blurry vision, the images and video didn't seem as dark as Thor did when we watched it in 3D.
that alone was a bonus.

if you already own the blu-ray and have 3D see if you can get it on-sale like we did and sell your old blu ray or give it away.
this movie was a hit with the family in 3D.",1361750400,,1038,4.133663366336633

4836227,5,B005MQWJPG,"I'm a kid of 59 who is completely in love with this wonderful movie! I had heard of the title, but never watched it until my husband told me it was a don't-miss-it view. It drew me in from the first scene; by the end I was in happy tears because the protagonists made it through! Needless to say, it's now a treasured part of my DVD collection.

I have 4 cats (and am well on my way to the rank of Crazy Cat Lady), and there is no doubt in my mind that Toothless the dragon is solidly based on a cat. His facial expressions, body movements, and personality is utter cat-like. It's clear that the artist(s) know and love cats very well. One of my furbabies, a Russian Blue named Shadow, is Toothless to a ""T"", so much that we've started calling him Toothless (especially when he's mischievous). It's silly, but I am totally in love with this dragon.

Hiccup is the kind of kid I'd love to have as my son. I remember feeling left out and ""different"" many times as a teen, so I identify with Hiccup's dilemmas. He's a real diamond in the rough; maybe not the Viking his father Stoick the Vast is, but intelligent, creative, thoughtful, and compassionate. His friendship with Toothless is wonderfully touching, because Toothless is not his pet but his companion and a respected equal.

For me, this ranks in my top 10 all-time best movie list, up there with the ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogies, as well as classics like ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"".

The dragons don't talk and there aren't a lot of interesting side characters. The viking students are okay I guess, but there's no Furious Five in there. I do wish there was an actual treacherous villain instead of a Giant volcanic dragon. I think the story and characters are obviously too similar to ""Ratatouille"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"", but that doesn't mean it's bad, just not as good as those films are.

What, then, if the female lead came to love the man who abused her in these ways?  Would this film be good entertainment for your young daughter?

It's terrifying that a female treating a male character the same way qualifies as children's entertainment.  Unfortunately, How to Train Your Dragon openly depicts this kind of abusive relationship as a happy relationship.

It's been over a year since writing this.  I'm leaving the above as-is so that the replies can be read in context.  Some of them, even the disagreeing ones, are very thoughtful and shouldn't have the context ripped from them.

Gender isn't the issue.  Abuse from romantic partners is the issue.  No one's sons or daughters should be hit by their partners.  No one's sons or daughters should be so ashamed of their feelings that they feel the need to hit their partners.  The feelings shown masked by violence should be some of the happiest emotions a person can feel.  Love.  Affection.  Happiness.  Those are the good things in life and should not come with a compulsion to abuse or be abused.  This is a human matter.  Abuse in reality is not the joke presented in this movie.

Yes, I have spoken to my kids.  I asked them why they thought Astrid was hitting Hiccup.

""Because she secretly loves him.""  A person hits when that person loves, and it's never questioned.

I really think that conversation needs to come with watching this movie.",1355184000,17,1704,4.653198653198653

4836296,3,B005MQWJPG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 Who knew? Fire-breathing dragons deep down inside are really touchy-feely creatures as long as you know how to train them right. That essentially is the premise of the much-acclaimed Dreamworks animated film, 'How to Train Your Dragon'. Of course there's a deeper message here (quoting the late Rodney King): ""Why can't we all get along?"".

This is perhaps the first film I can remember where the great pillaging clan of Vikings are not pitted against human opponents and hence their reputation as a group of sadistic, murderous thugs is tempered by the aggression of their dragon antagonists. Leave it to the film's protagonist, Hiccup, the young nerdy son of the Viking leader, Stoick the Vast (curiously voiced by Gerard Butler, with a Scottish accent!), to teach his community an important lesson: it's better to use your brains instead of brawn.

It takes a while for 'Dragon' to get going as the break into the second act doesn't occur until Hiccup begins nursing 'Toothless', the cute but hyperactive dragon (that he's responsible for injuring), back to health. Toothless looks like a leopard with wings but appears to have the temperament of a lovable canine. It turns out that the dragons have an excuse for all their bad behavior: they're beholden to a giant 'killer' dragon who the Vikings fear but who have never seen. Hiccup uncovers the mystery of this frightening behemoth when he flies into its lair after figuring out how to pilot Toothless, without falling off of him, in the air.

Meanwhile back at the Viking village, Hiccup, much to his chagrin, is forced to participate in dragon training school with a coterie of fellow young misfits. Voiced by such comic luminaries as Jonah Hill and Kirsten Wiig, Hiccup's 'associates' all follow the 'macho' Viking line: kill the unpleasant dragons at any cost. Much of the antics of the youngsters are rather one-note, as they parrot the macho posturing of the community at large. Finally, Hiccup, through his sensitive handling of the out of control creatures, turns his colleagues around and trains them how to calm the dragons down, without killing them.

The stakes are raised when Hiccup refuses to kill a dragon at the end of the training and his father disowns him. Stoick, raises an armada of his heavily armed Vikings, and with Toothless in tow (now chained on board the lead vessel), head out to the island where the big, bad monster awaits them. Leave it to Hiccup and his buddies to save the day by flying out to the island on board the formerly imprisoned dragons (back at the training school) and eliminate the monster in a rousing fight to the finish.

With the bad dragon eliminated, the dragon population 'understands' that the Vikings are really on their side and are now quite amenable to being house trained. And of course, even macho Stoick, sees the light and ends up apologizing to his son. I suppose all this is an acceptable children's story but adults will feel a little less satisfied. If underneath, this is a tale about how humans treat animals, it's a rather fanciful conceit that leopards or tigers (which the dragons seemingly represent), can so easily be domesticated. If on the other hand, if the dragons represent a misunderstood group of humans (demonized by the Vikings who lack the insight into their nature), the fact that they ALL suddenly become peaceful (because they're now treated with 'sensitivity' by humans), hardly seems to reflect the reality of true human-to-human interactions. Throughout history, attempts to mollify belligerent peoples through appeasement, have resulted in disastrous consequences.

In short, 'How to Train Your Dragon', is a feel-good tale, politically correct tale, best suited for children. Adults, however, will still be much impressed by the excellent, sumptuous animation, painstakingly created over a number of years by a group of highly talented animators. Whether the animation is enough for the viewer to overlook the rather lackluster story, is a matter of personal taste. For me, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is worth a look, decidedly for its impressive technical achievements, as opposed to its rather predictable narrative.",1349568000,,4209,5.037356321839081

4836301,1,B005MQWJPG,"(Written by my son - Jesse):  I am a HUGE fan of the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" book series and this movie is the one of the worst book-turns-movie's that I have ever seen.  If you haven't read the book, you may not care, but for true fans here is my list of where the movie went wrong:

1: Fishlegs, Hiccup's best friend:  In the book Fishlegs is small and timid.  In the movie, he is very big and lots less timid.

2: Camacazi, Hiccup's girlfriend:  In the book, Camacazi is not a Hooligan tribesman.  She is a member of the Meathead tribe.

3: In the book, Hiccup's dragon is in no way big or deadly.  In fact he is a totally unremarkable, small, common breed that can't do much of anything.

4: In the book, the tribe does not fight dragons.  They have them as pets and they feed them and all that.

5: SPOILER ALERT - SKIP IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK AND PLAN TO DO SO:  The end of the book involves two sea dragons that fight each other.  Hiccup creates a plan to get them to attack each other.  The plan does NOT work as it did in the movie.

6.  Finally, lots of small parts were messed up as well, but that would cause the list to exceed 50 points.

So, I highly recommend that you read the book.  It is way better.  Obviously, the creators of the movie did not read the book.",1346803200,17,1287,4.027777777777778

The use of 3D was not just to draw you in with some artsie-fartsie way but used as pop and depth, it was used in a very good way and it did put you into the movie with the use of 3D in the best way when the Dragon was being ridden.

Would I have been more impressed if it was done in Avater fashion,  Yes but the full on 3D when the Night Fury was flying was so good that it puts the movie in the just under Avatar in 3D but equal to Avatar 3D no.

4836304,5,B005MQWJPG,"This film is a masterpiece in the ""kidult"" (kid/adult) movie category. All family will find something to love here - younger children will love the funny dragons and Vikings, teenagers will most probably be seduced by humour and music and the adults will certainly appreciate the most excellent dialogues and especially this incredible first date during which the main hero steals forever the heart of the girl who just one hour earlier furiously, insanely, visceraly and totally hated his guts!

Without providing too many SPOILERS, I will try to describe the appeal of this film focusing on four points: the main hero, the First Contact with an alien intelligence, the PERFECT First Date and the PERFECTION of the scenario.

1. The hero. From the first moments of the film it is simply impossible to not like, at least a little, a young boy named Hiccup the Useless (a.k.a Hiccup the Horrendous), son of Stoic the Vast, of the tribe of Hairy Hooligans, from the land of Berk...))) Living amongst possibly the proudest and fiercest tribe of all the Vikings, Hiccup has problems to fit in, as he has less muscles and natural born ferocity than his kinsmen.

Having suffered from social isolation for most of his life, he developped a very sarcastic and bitter sense of humour, a solid complex of inferiority and a taste for staying away from others, in the safe haven of the workshop of the blacksmith Gobber, of whom he is the only apprentice.

It would be however difficult to see him as a loser, as he spend most of his time since early childhood working very hard and also intensely studying - which made him into the chief tinkerer of the whole Viking village and a very promising future blacksmith. However, his love for extravagant contraptions put him in a lot of trouble many times and many Vikings of Berk consider him almost as a threat to the public safety...)))

Now, the Vikings of Berk are tough customers, because since 300 years they wage a desperate war against the local dragons. The land of Berk is poor in natural resources and dragons try daily to steal every scrap of food they can find in Viking village - sheep, fish and even chicken are stolen at the first opportunity. Unwilling to starve, the Vikings developped weapons and tactics to fight the various dragons and until now managed to survive. But the fight is getting tougher and tougher and when the story begins the food supplies are running exceptionally low - and the long and cruel winter will be coming soon... In such hard times everybody is needed to fight to the best of his abilities and Hiccup is send finally into military training together with other youths of his age: Fishlegs, Snotlout, twins Tuffnut and Ruffnut and especially Astrid, the girl with whom he is hopelessly in love like since always - and who despises him openly and comes even to hate him passionately...

Now, Hiccup, although being weaker and less bloodthirsty than other Vikings, is definitely not a peacenik. He certainly likes tinkering - but what he builds are war engines! He is also all in favour of waging the war - but as the story develops he will realise that it is crucial that his tribe starts waging the RIGHT KIND of war... And ultimately it will become clear that far from being a loser, he is in fact the greatest warrior of his tribe as he will face, defeat and slay the most powerful, terrifying and evil creature that his tribe has ever met! And there are some moments in the story, in which he displays a steel strong determination and he even can be a little bit ruthless... Combined with wits, humour, honor, courage and generous heart, all this makes him a very likeable and exceptionnal hero of a movie for kids... Small wonder that he finally manages to tame the (lovely and clever) shrew whom he loved from the first sight when they were both barely out of their diapers...

2. The First Contact with an alien intelligence. Of all the dragons the Vikings of Berk ever faced, there is one, which even the most ferocious warriors fear - the Night Fury! Nobody ever saw the Night Fury and lived to tell the tale, so even after 300 years of war, nobody has any idea how this dragon looks like... But it exists, that much is certain and it is an absolutely deadly creature. The Night Fury is so fast, that it is impossible to see it clearly in the night sky (it comes out of its secret lair only after sunset) and it creates supersonic blasts when it accelerates! Also, its flame blast is exceptionally powerful - so hot, that it is white-blue and so fast, that it hits the target before even people on the ground realise that they are being shot at. And the Night Fury is also more clever than other dragons, always avoiding traps and always attacking in the weak spots of Viking defences. In one word, Night Fury is death.

But because of his intelligence and courage (and also a little bit of luck) Hiccup will manage to see this particular dragon - and even better than just see... During the film the teenager and the deadly but intelligent alien creature will establish a truce, then an understanding, then an alliance - and finally a very deep and sincere friendship. This gradual process is shown with a breathtking perfection, a great intelligence and attention to details and tons of humour - and it is very, very touching...

3. The PERFECT first date. I will not enter into details here, because it is important that you discover this great moment of cinema unspoiled, but this is one of the most beautiful scenes I saw in a film ever. I am now a married man and a father of two children (so not really a teenager anymore) but the PERFECT first date from this film very pleasantly reminded me of this time in life when the world seems to smile to us, when the sky is singing, when nothing else counts that this magic moment and when everything is good, pure, beautiful and exactly as it should be... Allow yourself to open your heart beginning with the scene in which Astrid beats Hiccup with her fists and the handle of her battleaxe (definitely a required thing for the PERFECT first date) and let yourself be seduced by the magic of everything that follows. Believe me, you will not regret it...

4. The perfection of the scenario. The film makes a full circle and the ending of the story connects perfectly with its beginning (including a very clever use of words ""pest"" and ""pet""). There is not even one moment of weakness. There is absolutely no one scene which could be deleted without harming the film and I can hardly imagine what else could have been added. The dialogues are simply perfect - full of wit and humour, they all have their importance. All characters are very well developped - other than Hiccup, Astrid and the Night Fury, those who are the most crucial are Stoic the Vast and Gobber. A good thing is that the film doesn't bash any characters - there is no ""bad guys"" amongst the Vikings and even when Stoic the Vast makes a huge mistake of judgment we can actually very well understand his reasons - and also there is no doubt that although pigheaded and very conservative, he is nevertheless a very brave and absolutely selfless man, entirely dedicated to the survival of his tribe. A very succesful character is Fishlegs, a somehow obese young Viking who clearly played too much ""Dungeons and Dragons"", as he knows all the dragon statistics by heart... As a long time ADD player myself I laughed out loud during all his nerdy comments and interventions...)))

The story gets quite serious towards the end, by showing that the real evil (with capital E, V, I, L and an exclamation mark) can not be ignored, escaped or appeased - it must be faced, fought, defeated and mercilessly eraditcated. But when there is a fight there are casualties on both sides and there is no blodless victories - and so even the greatest triumph brings its part of grief, loss and sorrow. The great thing about ""How to train your dragon"" is that although there is a happy ending, it is not precisely an eezy peezy pink candy sweet kind of happy ending - it is a surprisingly serious happy ending in which relief, happiness and cheerfulness are mixed with just a tiny little bit of sadness (not enough to make little kids cry though).

Bottom line, this film is a treasure and a pleasure. If you didn't see it, go get it. It will make you laugh a lot, cheer you up no matter how bad was your day. And the PERFECT first date scene will mend many wounds that time unavoidably inflicted to your heart (as it did to all of us) and certainly make you smile with just the right kind of nostalgy (if you are a fully grown up adult) ot just the right kind of expectation (if you are still in your early teens). ENJOY!",1344470400,,8709,4.572069186418962

4836307,5,B005MQWJPG,I am normally really picky about 3D movies and only really liked Avatar before seeing this as a movie worthy of having 3D and how they did it. Aside from the movie being great and my kids loving it. The 3D depth is done wonderfully in this version. I am not really big on extra features so that was not a big factor to me on this version. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys 3D and especially to those who already enjoyed the movie it does really add to the experience.,1344211200,2,484,4.159574468085107
4836308,5,B005MQWJPG,"At the time this movie came out, I still had a rather low expectation of Dreamworks' animated movies. With the release of Kung Fu Panda, however, it finally seemed like Dreamworks' may have been moving past the painful jokes, boring plot themes, and agonizing ending dance sequences of some of its previous titles. But, after seeing the sub-par trailer for this movie, I dismissed it as ""Another one of -those- Dreamworks movies"" and thus completely ignored it until just a few weeks ago. And here I am weeks later, egg all over my face, still geeking out about this movie.

I was definitely not expecting this movie to be as good as it is. The characters and the connections between them are deep and powerful (with an exception). The story does a great job of introducing tension and drama, but it can still be lighthearted and humorous when needed. The designs of the characters, while obviously aimed at the younger demographic in that stereotype-influenced way, does a great job of making the people feel alive. The dragons are very well designed, expressive, and feel genuinely threatening or friendly as needed. All these things wrap up into a thrilling adventure that never feels boring.

I must also give special mention to the soundtrack. Especially my favorite song, ""Test drive"", which is both powerfully emotional and impressive. The music fits perfectly with this movie, and wonderfully captures the emotion and tone within the scenes. The soundtrack is easily worth a purchase on it's own.

In terms of the movie itself, if I had to put some problems down, I would say that the story is a bit formulaic and a tiny bit predictable. I think the choice of voice actor for Hiccup could have been better. Lastly, my biggest problem with the movie was the romance which feels way too artificial and, in my opinion, completely unneeded. On the technical side of things, I really don't like the aspect ratio of this movie. It leaves some unsightly black bars on my monitor.

All of these relatively minor complaints aside, as the movie stands it is great. Really great. Easily one of my most favorite movies of all time. I highly recommend it to all ages and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel.",1343865600,2,2201,4.78421052631579

4836319,4,B005MQWJPG,"A dragon will always, always go for the kill.

This is the Isle of Berk, home of some Vikings.  They are led by Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler) a bulky dragon-killing warrior.  His son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), hasn't inherited many (or any) of his old man's attributes.  He's weak, brainy, and a bit sensitive.  Instead, he works in the smithy with Gobber the Belch (Craig Ferguson).  During the opening battle/dragon raid, Hiccup pulls out one of his contraptions and pulls down the most mysterious dragon kind of known and nobody believes him.  When he comes face to face with the dragon, he can't bring himself to kill it and sets it free.  He then has to start up his dragon-killing training (with the regular kids, including hottie, Astrid (America Ferrera)).  Well, as he becomes better acquainted with Toothless, his pet dragon, he finds that his Viking brethren don't really understand the dragons.

How to Train Your Dragon (2010) is a (rather loose) adaptation of the book of the same name (published in 2003).  I've not read it.  I imagine it's quite nice.  Apparently, the central story is completely different.  Just thought you'd like to know.

It's a really good story.  It's not completely outside our experience as the would-be killer changes their views about the enemy once they actually meet one.  But that totally works in the hands of people who know when to play the right music, which these people seem to do.

That's not quite fair to How to Train Your Dragon because the movie actually performs the task much better than most.  In a movie like Avatar (2009), the main character runs around with the ""enemy"" for a bit and then comes to love them.  In this movie, Hiccup's inquisitiveness and sensitivity is what brings him closer to the dragon(s) and that takes time.

He slowly learns about Toothless (crap name, by the way) and applies those lessons one at a time.  He grows in confidence and becomes his own man.  It's very well done and it makes this movie well worth the time.

Now I'll get into slagging it off.

A little too preoccupied with giving us a RPG-style description of the dozens of dragons they've got.  If you don't know role-playing games, I'm guessing the ""level 5 shield"" was complete nonsense to you.  I liked some of the latter, but not so much of the former.  Am I supposed to remember all of these kinds of dragons?  Is that going to be important?  No?  Then chill.

It cuts both ways, of course, because Hiccup's learning about the dragons helps him to deal non-lethally with the dragons.  We need to understand both the dragons and the Vikings' views of them to make sense of things.  So, there's a balance to be set here, but they probably could have done it more elegantly.  Much less at the very start, for one thing.

I wasn't a huge fan of the animation style.  The humans look like Bratz while the dragons seem to be inspired by Puff.  Obviously, this is a kids movie primarily, so there's no reason to expect Beowulf (2007), and a good thing too, but they could have added some texture.  It keeps things playful.

The playfulness, though, is also a bit of a problem.  They talk about killing dragons (thousands in fact), but we never see them do it.  Of course we don't, that would break up the BAM, SMASH comic fighting with too much reality.  And yet, when they've got to [Spoiler] the [Spoiler] [Spoiler], when it comes time to finish it, they've got to change gears on that theme.

Another time, during dragon slayer training, Hiccup seems to come within an inch of being blasted to death.  But that fire gets completely absorbed by the shield and nobody gets hurt.  I'm saying there's some mixed messages there.  When should we get nervous?

I'm not sure what a director does in these kinds of films, but Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders directed.  They also wrote along with William Davies.  For writing credits, it went both ways, as I mentioned, but I'm willing to allow a little over-zealous exposition when it's got well-paced development on the back end (at least as far as Hiccup is concerned).  Outside of Hiccup, characters are pretty functional, but that's to be expected.

I'd put the voice acting at about par.  They weren't asked to get very deep, but they didn't seem to try very hard.

One of the few animated films that doesn't rely on a relentless barrage of zingers, but relies entirely on its charming plot.  You've got to respect that.  Personally, I prefer a movie like Rango (2011) that gives you both, but I prefer How to Train Your Dragon to the one-liners-only movies that were the sequels to Shrek (2001).",1337990400,,4593,4.644278606965174
4836320,5,B005MQWJPG,"First, this has little to nothing to do with the book of the same title.

Second, this is loads of fun.

Young Hiccup lives in a Viking village routinely raided by dragons (they don't leave because of ""stubbornness issues"").  He wants to train to fight dragons himself, but he's a skinny little boy, barely suited to the task.

When he finally does get his chance to kill a dragon, he learns very little is what it first seems, and that is true of himself as much as it is true about the dragons.

Thematically, this is about acceptance, and self-acceptance.  It's about using one's unique skills to succeed.  It's about looking deaper for the truth.

In tone, it's hillarious.  One character, on speaking of why they're going to hunt dragons, says ""We're vikings.  It's an occupational hazzard.""  It's suited to small children, even sensitive small children.  Adults will enjoy it too.",1337817600,,886,4.7947019867549665

The opening battle scene is impressive, presenting background information while capturing a chaotic ""fog of war"" feeling.  The flight sequences are absolutely amazing.  The story, too, is well-written:  a universal plot, awkward teen comes of age, in the imaginative setting of an ancient Viking settlement.  Some twists and turns happen along the way, but everything turns out right in the end.  The pacing is great, not a dull moment, and some lesser-known but well-chosen actors voice the characters.

First of all, why do all the dragons except one look cute?  What's the point of that?  It's extremely unrealistic, and I don't think the fact that this is a family film is a good excuse for cute dragons.

The adults are viewed here as dumb compared to the kids who seem to have the bigger brains than the adults.  Sometimes it drove me nuts.

Unfortunately, this film was pretty unfunny.  I can only remember one joke that I chuckled at, but it was a potty joke, go figure.

The way the movie ended was dumb.  I'm sorry, but it bothers me when two kids start falling for each other so early.  Not to mention, the ending felt way too good to be true for the character.  Think about Toy Story 3 or Despicable Me where, while the endings are happy happy joy joy, it actually gives off some good emotion for the characters that makes us happy for them.  Here, the ending just felt too good to be true for the character, I mean, it's not like all of the character's troubles will be gone forever, and I expect an ending that isn't SOOO happy, sorry, maybe i'm a killjoy here, and it's not like I don't like happy endings, but I expect happy endings that has some emotion for the character.

The story's quite different than the one in the children's book it's based on, but I didn't mind at all.

4836353,4,B005MQWJPG,"It's all a little too easy to feel like Dreamworks Animation is still struggling to clinch the number one spot with Pixar.  Lord knows that they have their work cut out for them.

But, they're learning, and it's not necessarily from flattering imitation that Dreamworks is quickly becoming a worthy challenger to Disney's powerhouse.  Nope; they deserve more credit than that.

It began with Shrek, cemented itself with Kung Fu Panda, and now comes to fruition with Peter Hastings' Dragons.  And, although not everything it throws at us accompanies its soaring to the heavens, this is still something very special.

There's an innocent majesty present here that not even Pixar replicates on a regular basis.  Some could say that this is hollow alternative wording for a movie that simply knows how to present itself, but it goes beyond that.  Here is finally an animated film that strikes the perfect core with 3D cinema.

It exhilarates without overplaying, without shamelessly capitalizing upon the gimmicks that can accompany this new breed of filmmaking.  Rather, this film flexes its engine with grace, and the results are quite awesome, particularly during the flying sequences.

From a structural standpoint, the plot stretches itself thin over the course of an hour and forty minutes.  It's timely and developed without an ounce of sagging or clumsiness, but the charming nature owes its strengths largely to the loving craft that the tech artists have put into the characters and their chemistry with one another.  The dragons, especially, affix themselves to our adoration with their quirks and oddly feline idiosyncrasies.

Predictably enough, these reptiles are the undisputed stars of the show, and they make every scene worthwhile, even when the pacing drags at the midpoint.  Still, you cant criticize the team from taking a methodical approach to the character development, and it eventually pays off in the long run.

The film gets another massive boost from its two lead performances, perhaps forming one of the most unlikely effective pairs yet seen in Dreamworks Animation.  Both Butler and Baruchel couldn't be better as father and son, making their plays off of one another sound easy.  It goes a long way towards making the drama effectively moving.

All of this aside, I suppose I must admit that this is a film about dragons flying around, through and through.  Everything stems from this strength and, taking this solely into consideration, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a staggering success.  Neither vikings nor dragons have been very successful at the box office, and it takes a lot of work for an animation team to rise from the shadows of their establishes superiors.  Hastings and company's ""Dragons"" seems destined to do both.",1324166400,,2759,5.111607142857143

Not many movies have grabbed my attention like this one.  We kept the movie for 2 weeks and watched it every night.  After I returned it, I bought it from Amazon.

4836362,5,B005MQWJPG,"I bought this quite some time ago in an auction because at the time it, like Avatar 3D, was proprietary: Dragon with Samsung, Avatar with Panasonic.

The craft in this film by Dreamworks Animation is the equal to what Disney has been doing recently. The actors are perfect, though it is not clear why the Vikings (played by Scotsmen Craig Ferguson and Gerard Butler) speak with a Scots accent while the kids (Jay Baruchel, America Ferrara) sound as if the stepped off a California beach. But it works. The story has been changed from the book series by Cressida Cowell on which the film is based in that the many types of dragons that frequent the Island of Berk start as protagonists. The slightly built Hiccup decides to capture a dragon with his cannon/net invention and surprises himself by knocking the dreaded Toothless out of the night sky, injuring him in the process. With another invention Hiccup fixes Toothless's problem and gains his trust, but he fears the reaction of the adults as well as his peers if they discover his pet dragon -- which, of course, they do.

How to Train Your Dragon was nominated for two Oscars (best animated film, best original score) and to my mind it should have won BOTH. The score by John Powell is epic in its scope, and uses Celtic themes that play off the Scots accents. I rarely buy CDs of a film score, but I bought this one. The track ""Test Drive,"" accompanying the scene where Hiccup takes Toothless out for a spin, literally, is as good as many a John Williams classic and is stunning in its emotional ride. (The track by Jonsi (of the Icelandic group Sigur Ros) that plays over the credits is great in its own way but unnecessary.)

My only complaint with Dragon is that the 3D screen ratio is 2.35:1 -- very wide screen. I have to agree with James Cameron in his decision to released Avatar at 1.78:1 because, he stated, the extra visible picture (rather than black bars) top and bottom on a wide-screen TV results in an enhanced 3D effect -- a greater sense of depth. I wish there were a bit more Dragon.

But that is a small complaint relative to the grandeur of this animated film and its story and score. Bravo!",1320796800,30,2168,4.5229591836734695

Although if you want to get one in the future 3D will always be an option. The 3D looks just as great at home for this movie. It also includes TrueHD, unlike many blu-ray releases today. It makes a huge difference in the audio quality and the true movie accurate surround sound. I should mention I have an LG PASSIVE 3D HDTV meaning it does not use battery powered active shutter glasses. I highly encourage everyone to consider getting an HDTV with passive 3D.

The story is engaging, delightful, and touching. A young lad who doesn't quite fit in with his community ends up redefining his community for the better.

The technical execution of the animation is just amazing. You will see an astonishing attention to detail in all the gestures and facial expressions... that is, if you aren't totally absorbed in the movie.

The voice acting: top notch. I especially enjoyed the voice of the Viking Chief (the actor played Leonidas in 300)

Extras: the DVD comes with two mini documentaries on the making of the film, both of which are fantastic. (Lots of self-promotion in them, to be sure, but I'm ok with that.)

In the category of stuff that I didn't like but probably wouldn't bother others:
The scene where the dragon tries to smile - sappy; didn't buy it
The engineering of the tail fin - not credible

4836376,3,B005MQWJPG,"I wanted to like this movie.

And it does have engaging things.

The Night Fury dragon, Toothless, that Hiccup adopts is cute and likable.  In the commentary, the animators talk a long time about how hard they had to work to fashion a cute, yet still scary, face.

One look at ""Stitch"" from ""Lilo and Stitch"" will show that they needn't have worked so hard.  They could have stolen Stitch's (maybe they did).

Likewise, the moral is engaging: better to understand and befriend than demonize and kill.

Also, Astrid is cute, and the love-story is humorously un-romantic.

But still, I had a hard time liking it.

One reason was Jay Baruchel's voice for Hiccup.  In the commentary, Baruchel becomes effusive with what a super, great, life-changing and world-changing movie this was.  But it isn't.  I can't tell if Baruchel actually believes this, or is just protesting too much.  Baruchel gets the ""Christian-Slater-Talk-Alike"" award, but his whinyness gets old fast.

Another reason is the static appearance of Stoick, Hiccup's father.  Yes, he is mildly engaging, but only mildly.  The animators talk at length about what a breakthrough he is, but his braided beard and furry coat look merely painted on, and his body moves like a robot.

The dragons are uniformly cute and interesting, but the human characters are uniformly monotonous.

Despite the raves of all the people who worked on the movie (in the commentary), really it is nothing special to look at.  And even if it were, mere appearance can never make up for mediocre characters.",1316995200,3,1542,4.929961089494164

They weren't wrong. My partner and I took the film with us on a recent long plane flight and were pretty blown away. We were expecting a fun, cute romp, but what we got was not only a fun, cute romp, but also a clever, polished, and beautifully animated tale with a surprising amount of heart and some really genuinely poignant moments. The characters are all very sympathetic and feel very real, and the relationships between them are fleshed out but subtle. There's plenty of fun for younger kids, but there's also a lot of wit and more complex emotions for older audiences to enjoy as well (finally, a film for kids that does not rely on crude humor and doesn't dumb itself down for its younger viewers). On top of all of that, the score is actually really fantastic - given that a plane flight isn't the greatest environment to hear musical subtleties, we watched it again when we got home - and absolutely deserved the Oscar nomination it received. All in all, this film is without a doubt a solid favorite of mine, and definitely the best thing to have come out of DreamWorks Animation since ""Shrek"" (although the two are quite different films), and, in terms of not only animation quality but also storytelling and emotional core, right up there with Pixar greats like ""Up.""",1313020800,,1527,4.516245487364621
4836391,5,B005MQWJPG,"My wife and I love this movie but one tiny thing bugs me a bit every time we watch it...why do the Vikings have Scottish accents? Being Norwegian & Swedish (as well as German & Irish) myself I'm the first one to admit that actual Norwegian or Scandinavian accents probably don't sound as ""neat"" as Scottish but kids being as impressionable as they are & with little sponge brains remembering everything they hear I hope none of them get teased at school if they imitate a Scandinavian with a Scottish brogue! But then some ""adults"" today probably don't know the difference either!
That's really a very minor critisizm because otherwise we love the story & think the animation is incredible. The details are amazing. I do think some of the critiques here are probably accurate but I hope some of them remember & appreciate just how unbelievable the quality of animation is today! We grew up with Snow White, Cinderella and Fantasia for movies and Popeye, Tom & Jerry and Huckleberry Hound for televison so the current crop of animated movies is nothing short of absolutely amazing.

In this day and age when quality animated features are the rule rather than the exception, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" still manages to beat all comers with its charm, imagination and honest sentiment.

Based on the story by Cressida Cowell, the movie focuses on Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Jay Baruchel), the scrawny young son of a Viking leader (Gerard Butler) who worries that his boy may not possess the mettle a true Viking warrior must have to smite the many dragons that periodically swoop in on the village to steal its food.  It's not that Hiccup doesn't WANT to be a dragon-slayer; heck, he's even enrolled in a dragon-slaying course replete with real dragons for the students to practice their moves on.  No, the problem is that Hiccup has met and made friends with an injured dragon in the wild (a beast he calls Toothless) and the lad soon discovers that dragons are not the natural-born enemies to Man that he and the other Vikings thought they were.

Beyond its glorious visuals, eye-popping action sequences, and terrific voiceover work, ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" written and directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, emerges as a surprisingly compelling human tale of a boy who wants desperately to live up to the high standards his demanding father has set for him, but who just can't betray his new-found best friend in order to do so.  Without getting sappy about it, the movie provides fine moral lessons for the youngsters - though, one should point out that the intensity of the action scenes may prove a tad disturbing for the very littlest in the audience.  Its soaring flight scenes are some of the best we've ever encountered in an animated movie, and its canny combination of humor, adventure and sentiment catapult it to the head of the class among recent animated films (along with ""Toy Story 3,"" that is).",1312070400,,1851,4.783699059561129

At first it was pretty scary and she sat on my mother's lap throughout most of the movie, however, it is now her favorite and she askes to watch it everyday.  The PG rating is appropriate and I would say it is a bit scary for the younger crowd (<5).  The dragons spit fire and attack the city.  The story is great though - a boy that does not live up to his father's (and society's) expectations of bravery, overcomes his fear and saves the town and the dragons.  There is a pretty scary fight scene toward the end between the Vikings and the Dragon ruler, but in the end, good overcomes evil and the dragons and Vikings live in peace.  I probably would have waited until she was a bit older (5-6) to introduce her to this movie, but it all worked out ok...",1310947200,,859,4.2073170731707314
4836396,5,B005MQWJPG,"`How to Train our Dragon' has such charming buoyancy about it, a delightful air of warmth that sucks you in and keeps you glued to every frame.  Taking the source material and using it as a mere foundation for a far more accessible story, `How to Train Your Dragon' is one of those rare films that gets the clich&eacute;s just right.  I'm certainly a skeptic when it comes to clich&eacute;s, but certain films underscore them in a way that makes them feel pertinent to the story, and that is the case here.  Instead of transferring the oddly uninspired prose developed in the children's book to the big screen, `How to Train Your Dragon' is something completely different and far more effective thanks to the sharp changes made to the story itself.

The film follows an unlikely hero, Hiccup.  Hiccup is a Viking, son to the chief and yet he is, well, not very Viking-like.  He's small and scrawny and peaceable, as opposed to big and brawny and violent.  When all of Hiccup's fellow villagers are waging war against the dragons, slaying them left and right and training their hardest to defend their livelihoods, Hiccup is befriending them.  Soon it becomes apparent to Hiccup that the misconception surrounding these winged beasts needs to be addressed, and changed for the betterment of the Viking people and for the dragons themselves.  With his newfound friend, a rare and dangerous dragon he names Toothless, Hiccup attempts to change the minds of his people, but that is easier said than done.

One thing of note regarding this film; it is visually arresting.  The CGI animation is superb, truly.  The character details are wonderful (Toothless himself being a wonder to the eyes) and the editing is as sharp as they come; splicing through scenes with marvelous effect.

The story, one of acceptance and love and growth, is exemplified by the simplistic approach to the script.  Like I said, it is one of those films that takes advantage of the clich&eacute;s it possesses.  Having read the source material (and not caring for it much at all), it is nice to see the themes presented in a much farer fashion in this splendid film.  The humor is subtle, yet effective, never beating the audience over the head with manipulated gags and one-liners.  Instead, the film allows the softness of the story to transcend.

The themes of loyalty and love are given a nice touch with each passing frame.

With tons of excitement and charm to boot, with a story that will appease both kid and adults, `How to Train Your Dragon' is yet another notch in the animation belt of 2010 (god, what a great year for animated films).  Don't worry too much about the thrills here either, as the action is presented in a way that the humor can shine and the scares don't last.  You'll little ones won't be hiding under the blanket or complaining of nightmares here.

Of course, the actual DVD was fairly bare bones.  This is not the 3D version or the one with the short film attached.  I've actually seen that version, and while the short film was cute, I didn't want to spend the extra bucks to purchase it.",1309996800,,521,4.309278350515464

Unfortunately, what keeps this movie from earning a four or five star review from me is its pacing.  The start and end felt very rushed.  I thought there were too many action sequences, and they dragged on a little too long.  I could not help but think that the action was there purely for spectacle-some of the scenes certainly did not warrant the amount of time given to them.

This was not a hilarious movie, but it did make me chuckle in places.  I thought the dragon was cute.  I did wish more time had been spent to developing some of the other characters-they didn't feel like they had much depth, and that was a shame because there was potential there for them.

Overall, this is a fun movie but nothing special.  Don't go into it expecting too much, and you won't be disappointed.",1309737600,2,973,4.3259668508287294

4836406,3,B005MQWJPG,"I wanted to do a review not on the movie (which I loved) but on the Single Disc Blu-Ray itself so you can determine whether you want to buy the Single Disc or the Two Disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo as it relates to bonus features since this info wasn't readily available when I was trying to make my decision.

Overall = 3 1/2 stars

Movie = 5 stars

Blu-Ray Single Disc Features = 2 stars

Like many reviewers of ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" I loved this movie!!  There were so many wonderful aspects of this movie that other reviewers have already noted (e.g. the unique take on the dragon story, the outstanding animation, the wonderful voice acting combined with the life-like expressions of the characters, the musical score, etc.), that I couldn't wait to get this on blu-ray when it came out.  The issue was which version to get since I only wanted to see this movie on blu-ray, and didn't need an extra disc.  Therefore, the easy solution would be to buy the Single Disc.  However, I also wanted all the extras (such as the deleted scenes and the 17 minute extra short story, along with your other typical extras that are found on disc).  The problem was that there is no description on what the bonus features would be on the Single Disc or what's missing.  So, I did a little research of the reviewer comments, did a global search online and even called Amazon's customer service, all of which/whom had limited or conflicting information.  I guess the safe thing to assume moving forward is that if it's not listed, there are probably very few extras.

However, I took a risk and purchased the Single Disc blu-ray since there was no conclusive info either way, and I didn't want to end up with a DVD I was never going to use (particularly given the $4.50 price difference between the Single vs. Two Disc Combo).  When the Single Disc arrived, I checked the package and it alluded to extras but didn't contain a listing so I literally had to open the disc and play the blu-ray.  Here is a list of what you get with the blu-ray that's contained in the Single Disc vs. the blu-ray contained in the Two Disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo b/c they are quite different.

EXTRAS IN SINGLE DISC BLU-RAY
* Viking-Sized Cast
* The Technical Artistry of Dragon
* Filmmakers' Commentary
* The Animators' Corner
* Trivia Track
* Dreamworks Animation Video Jukebox

EXTRAS IN BLU-RAY CONTAINED IN TWO DISC BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO PACK
Blu-ray includes:
* Legend of the BoneKnapper Dragon: Hiccup and the gang return to search for a mysterious dragon in this all-new adventure
* The Animators' Corner Enhances the Movie-Viewing Experience through Picture-in-Picture Storyboards, Behind-the-Scenes Footage and Insightful Interviews
* Uncover More Dragon Fun Facts through Pop-Up Trivia

And More Fiery Fun!

DVD Disc:
* Filmmakers' Commentary
* Viking-sized Cast
* The Technical Artistry of Dragons

So, if you're focused on getting a lot more extras on your blu-ray (like me), I would highly recommend getting the Two Disc version (vs. the Single Disc that I ended up buying).  If you are mainly focused on the movie itself and a handful of extras, then go with the Single Disc.  Hope this helps in your decision-making.",1308614400,257,3407,4.713322091062395

4836408,5,B005MQWJPG,"I'm a 23 year old male and even I like this movie and have recently ordered it from here. I'm a sucker for animation movies, so this was on my list to check it out. Which I did and I got to say, I loved it. When I watched the whole thing my first thought was this movie seemed a lot less generic like most movies are of today. That and well, dragons are cool no matter what age you are! The movie had almost no cliches that I can think of and felt like someone really did put some thought into this rather than basing the movie on pop culture and recycled ideas (see Shrek- I'm a Shrek fan as well, but that's what they do). There's really not a bland moment and I have a serious case of jitters where if something remotely bores me I got to go and do something else. This movie, however, achieves my attention. I can watch the movie from beginning to end without any problems.

Movie Overview(In a Nutshell):

I hate people giving me spoilers on the movies I'm about to watch, so I like to spare people of that myself, but here's just a little overview of the movie. Hiccup is the son of a viking leader who can't seem to impress anyone, including his father. After he takes down the baddest and fastest dragon (a Night Fury), they laugh at him, and he's sent home. Hiccup, however, has a problem with obeying and slips out the back door (literally) to check out his catch. He finds out he does catch it, but also finds out that the fear the dragons put into them is a mutual feeling amongst those they despise the most. After seeing he damaged the dragon's flying abilities, he decides to help him out, but can dragons and humans co-exist?

The Likes:

Hiccup is great for a few laughs, but in my opinion the comedy comes from the main dragon, Toothless. At first glance he looks like he could rip your head off, but then you will realize that he's as gentle as a cat (which is what he reminds me of). He's spunky, got's attitude, and is very intelligent. The plot is great and feels new, which is a major plus with me. I HATE generic movies and this doesn't feel like that. The ending is also pretty good as well.

The Dislikes:

Well, I can't really think of any to be honest, but I guess if I was to pick one it would be, I think it needs a cliffhanger. There's a planned sequel for 2014, so why not put a cliffhanger in there? Other than that, I can't think of any.

4836417,5,B005MQWJPG,"I love, love, love this movie!  In fact, I love so many things about it that it's hard to know where to begin.  Let's start with the plot.  This is a thoroughly charming tale of a boy and his dragon in a society that (to say the least) doesn't exactly like dragons.  Unlike so many animated films, it never dumbs down the story to reach a wider audience, it doesn't have hip pop culture references, it doesn't have poop jokes, and in general, it treats you like an adult while still being great for children.  The story is engaging and frequently moving (I found myself wiping away tears more than once), and the arc of the story, while not profoundly original, is very well handled.  Visually, the movie is absolutely gorgeous, with rich and vibrant colors that will take your breath away.  The movie is perfectly cast, and the characters are interesting and intelligent.  I have to particularly single out Jay Baruchel as Hiccup; his sardonic, self-deprecating wit really breathes life into his character.  The 3-D animation is absolutely fantastic; the dragon-riding scenes are just as exciting as similar scenes in Avatar.  As an ex-skydiver myself, these reminded me a lot of my own experiences in the air; the scene where Hiccup is falling from a great height astounded me, as he positions his body in a perfect skydiver's arch to give himself maximum control!

I've left the best for last.  This movie is full of great messages that are worth teaching to any child (and worth relearning if you've forgotten them as an adult), and this gives the movie an emotional core that sets it apart from other animated movies.  These messages include: kindness to animals, looking behind surface appearances for deeper truths, not blindly trusting authority, and being yourself even if it means you will be rejected by your peers.  We've seen all of these messages before in other films, but they are so integral to this movie and are so well integrated with the story that they give the film real depth.

The story line is well developed and the characters are funny and charming. Highly recommended. 5/5.,1304467200,,411,4.722222222222222

The opening does an amazing job at setting up the characters and what to expect from the rest of the film. Its exciting, entertaining and the characters are some of the best. The relationship between the Hicup and his father is an incredible story in itself. Other characters are funny and lovable. I can't get enough of this film!!",1304380800,,428,4.72

The movie easily gets a 5 out of 5 from me; it's not quite Toy Story 3, but it's just as great in its own way (I just slightly prefer Toy Story 3). The DVD quality looks great, and the bonus features are good, there just aren't enough of them.

4836434,5,B005MQWJPG,"This film is magnificent. I watched it on Netflix and then ordered it for my 12-yr-old honors grandson who is studying visual arts. I wanted him to see the special features on the animation.

In truth, this 68-yr-old woman found herself in tears at the end of this film, it is so touching. A great-grandmother was sitting in her living room cheering for the dragons! (I originally put it in my Netflix queue because I'm a Craig Ferguson fan...)

The first few minutes had me wondering if I was watching a video game, as that was the only part of the film that was sub-excellent. The animation is superb -- and I am a graphics artist, myself.
The story is thoughtful, but just a little scary for small children -- maybe, maybe not.

Gee, I never knew there were so many different kinds of dragons.

My personal favorite device was having the dragon guide book written in ""runes"" on the close-ups while the character reads aloud in Amer-English. Yes!",1303862400,,948,4.591715976331361

This is basically a well done tale of a boy and his ""dog"" with themes of acceptance at the forefront.  My nieces and nephews loved this one.  Adults should like it in varying degrees as well.

The main character, Hiccup, narrates into the story and really does a great job leading you into the story. I felt very bad for him in the beginning of the movie, as he like the skinny nerd of the movie. But after he first tries to kill the adorable black dragon to prove himself a real Viking- he realizes he cannot do it and sets it free. Afterwards he discovers the Dragon stuck in a canyon unable to escape after being injured. He then befriends the Dragon slowly and discovers the battle the Vikings have with the Dragons for years is not what it appears to be. The Dragon is terriably adorable, makes me want to have him at home :) They do a great job with giving him lovable personality you would not expect from a Dragon.

Dad then is lead to the Dragons nest and discovers the terrifing sight they are now up against.

. There is a growing-up story of the main hero, there is a getting-along component all the way through, there is a team-building theme present in the training scenes, lush eye candy with every frame, and characters you can really understand and sympathize with.
. The plot is rich but complete within the movie, the actions of the characters fit well with their expressed personalities and the situations they find themselves in, and there are bright spots of humor even in the darkest parts of the story - and there are indeed dark parts, since you can't have a glorious victory without a true foe.

Hiccup is a Viking who wants to be like his dragon-killing father Stoic. In the beginning, he actually shoots down the most feared dragon of them all, the Night Fury.  No one believes Hiccup since no one saw him shoot the dragon down.  But, they do see him run away from another dragon.  Hiccup ends up running away.  While running, Hiccup finds the Night Fury and instead of killing it, he decides to let it go due to feeling bad for it. The dragon almost goes for the kill, but in return for his release only roars in Hiccup's face. Apparently, the Night Fury lost a little bit of his tail wing from the crash during Hiccup's attempted capture.  Scared, Hiccup runs home and his father decides to let him train to fight dragons, only Hiccup now feels that he shouldn't.  Hiccup joins some other Vikings including his secret crush, Astrid, to begin training.  Taught by his lifelong teacher Gobber, Hiccup doesn't do so well in dragon training.  He finds the Night Fury again at a secret cliff.  After a few close encounters, Hiccup becomes friendly toward the dragon and he begins to invent a prosthetic replacement for his injured tail as well as inventing a saddle to fly on him.  He even names the dragon Toothless and later discovers secrets on how to get a dragon calm.  He uses those 'secrets' in dragon training, soon stealing all the attention from Astrid, who soon grows jealous, especially after it is decided that Hiccup would get to kill a dragon. One day, Astrid follows him into the woods and discovers Toothless after having a pep talk with Hiccup.  Toothless responds negatively to Astrid when he first sees her, and ends up taking her up on the saddle and ignoring Hiccup's commands, even making him say, ""Thanks a lot, you useless reptile!"" Astrid then apologizes during a sickening spin, and Toothless begins calmly flying. Astrid then begins to like the experience of flying on a dragon. But when she reminds Hiccup that he has to kill a dragon, Toothless overhears and flies at fast speed toward a secret location. They run into other dragons and go into a cave where they see the dragons tossing their food down into a fiery pit, which later is revealed to be a tyrannosaurus rex-type dragon who eats dragons that don't give it what it wants. Realizing they had found the ""nest"" that his father had been looking for, Hiccup tells Astrid not to tell anyone. The next day, Hiccup's father returns to the village to hear from his fellow Vikings that stayed behind that Hiccup had become top student in dragon training. Stoic is proud and gives Hiccup a Viking helmet made of his late mothers' breastplate. Hiccup comes up with an idea to convince everyone of the truth about dragons. The next day is the match where Hiccup is supposed to kill his first dragon, and he drops his weapons to try and be nice to it. But his father then gets enraged and the dragon gets spooked, causing the plan to fail. Hearing Hiccup's scream, Toothless comes into the field and fights the dragon off. However, he is later kidnapped by the Vikings and Stoic is angry at his son. Hiccup accidentally then reveals to him that he found the nest and Stoic goes out ignoring his son's warning. Stoic gathers a band of Vikings to go out with Toothless tied up on their boat. Stoic orders him to lead them to the nest. Toothless leads the Vikings to the nest, and meanwhile, Hiccup debates with himself on why he didn't kill Toothless in the first place. Astrid then reminds him that he was the first Viking to ride a dragon, and it makes him come up with an idea. Hiccup then convinces Snotlout, Fishlegs, Ruffnut, and Tuffnut about the truth on dragons. They then fly to the island where his father and fellow Vikings have already arrived, and they blast the cave open, scaring away all the dragons inside it. Following that, the tyrannosaurus dragon comes up from the ground enraged and tries to do away with the Vikings. Hiccup and company arrive and set up a plan to trap and kill the monster. Most of the Vikings are unsuccessful upon their jobs, but upon seeing that his son was right, Stoic saves him and Toothless while Hiccup was trying to save Toothless after the ship sunk from a fire blast by the dragon. Hiccup and Toothless fly into the sky and lure the tyrannosaurus dragon to fly up with it. After hiding from it in the sky, it fires at it into the mouth and causes it to fall. Unfortunately, during the blast to destroy it, Toothless crashes into the tail and causes him and Hiccup to fall into the flames. Toothless manages to rescue Hiccup alive, and his father finds them.  He ends up losing one of his legs (though he isn't shown without his leg) and is replaced by a prosthetic leg invented by Gobber. Hiccup then wakes up to see his people riding dragons. Hiccup is convinced by his father that they have realized the truth about dragons. Hiccup continues flying with his dragon and even gets a kiss from Astrid, as he would say, ""I could get used to it"".

The animation is absolutely breathtaking, and it seems like the most realistic animation of 2010 (ranking alongside Tangled and Legend of the Guardians). The action and peril seen is somewhat intense, though it isn't necessarily violent and it flies clear of bloodshed. The character Toothless is more adorable than menacing, and a character design that resembles closely to Stitch from Lilo & Stitch (probably because How To Train Your Dragon was directed by Lilo & Stitch's directors Dean DuBlois and Chris Sanders). There's also a few funny parts, particularly with Snotlout, Fishlegs, and Ruffnut and Tuffnut. It's comedy relief from some of the most dramatic parts.

Getting into further detail, I do have to say that there may be a few dragons that might scare young children, particularly under the age of 6. But, the combination of great action and pure heart make this movie a winner. The best release yet for DreamWorks Animation, and I am honestly looking forward to a sequel.",1297728000,,6208,4.649635036496351

4836463,5,B005MQWJPG,"""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a fun animated Dreamwork's flick to just sit back and enjoy.  It is based on the book by Cressida Cowell and the hero is shy ""Hiccup""  (Full name is Hiccup Horrendus Haddock III).  He is the skinny 13 year old son of a big and mighty Viking leader.  As part of Viking culture he must kill a dragon to prove he has warrior qualities and will be able to succeed his hero father in the Viking kingdom.  After Hiccup downs a dragon beast, he finds he cannot kill it.  He names it toothless and they become buddies as they help each other out.  The story shows how the kingdom has dragons of every ilk and many of them to boot!  It keeps you interested as the tide of opinion turns and a fantastic ending.  The only criticism I have is that the Vikings seem to have a Scottish accent instead of Nordic, and Hiccup's is just as American as can be.

4836470,5,B005MQWJPG,"First, something I've said in the past.  It's the script, stupid.  This script is brilliant in such a way that most of the reviewers here utterly miss it.  Let me explain.

You have a complicated fantasy world, with its own spin on Vikings and all different kinds of dragons.  Each kind of dragon has important strengths and weaknesses that are at times critical to the story.  The movie almost seamlessly gives you a lecture in Dragons 101 and the life of these Vikings, without being irritating or boring.  If you cannot understand the dragon side of the movie, you never should have watched it because you were determined to be bored anyway.  Plus the initial voice-over explaining all of this ties into action, and visuals, that both kick-start the narrative in high gear and mixes it with action sequences that both show what's being explained, and keep it fascinating and funny.  I wish my workplace training videos had 1/10th the effort put into them.

The story is fairly basic, but it's been claimed there are only seven main plots in literature (depending on whom you read, of course).  The fun is how you get there.  Yes, you have the outsider kid who is not interested in what all the other kids are into.  He makes good, and becomes the hero.  There's a girl involved too but anything else would be a plot spoiler - however, since you see her in her armor with skull decorations (small) in her first scene, I can safely reveal that she's definitely no shrinking violet. There is the plot line of maybe looking at why the other side is doing what it is doing, and the main character's (named Hiccup) questioning that is what provides for the story and much of the conflict.  Contrary to some other people's spin on it, there is a truly evil nemesis, and no amount of understanding is going to change this bad guy.  Understanding gains allies who had been adversaries, and the chance to win the final conflict.  But final conflict there is, and boy it's a doozy.

I wish I'd seen it in 3-D.  We saw it at home on blu-ray, and the video quality and sound-track are superb.  My seven year old daugher has declared it her favorite movie, and both my wife and I, who often take 20 minutes to agree on a movie, both love it and will watch it again.  Instead of trying to be pseudo-realistic the animation revels in being just that, and the movie is the better for it.  I am happy I do not have to vote on best Animated Film this year.  The three nominess we've caught, Toy Story 3, Tangled, and How to Train Your Dragon are all so different, and so well done, that I would have trouble choosing, Luckily, I can watch all three on Blu-ray.",1296259200,2,2644,4.473903966597077

4836496,4,B005MQWJPG,"I purchased the How to Train Your Dragon DVD for my children after seeing it in theaters last spring. This story of a skinny, nerdy, non-bloodthirsty young Viking boy was engaging and in many ways not the usual kids' movie. I can't think of a single pop culture reference, bodily function joke, or pratfall.
The movie is a little intense at times for very young children. There are several emotionally charged scenes back-to-back with no comic relief. In most movies aimed at children, if there's a dramatic or sad plot point, something funny will be thrown in to break the tension. That's not the case here. For example, when Hiccup's father (Stoick the Vast...ha!) disowns him, goes off to find and kill all the dragons, and takes Hiccup's newly befriended ""pet"" dragon Toothless away in chains, there are no potty jokes thrown in to lighten the mood. I think that's good, but my five year old was really stressed and worried the first time we saw the movie. Honestly, I was a little stressed and worried myself!
It's also unusual for a child's film to see a main character causing permanent harm to another character. Hiccup tries to kill Toothless early in the movie, because he's been taught that Vikings MUST kill dragons.  When his shot takes off part of the dragon's tail, he realizes Toothless will die if he doesn't help him learn to fly again so he can find food. It's in this process of trying to help Toothless that Hiccup begins to see there could be a way for dragons and Vikings to live together. The dragon paid a high price (he can no longer fly without Hiccup's help) for that lesson, and Hiccup also loses something he can't replace in the end while helping both the dragons and the Vikings overcome a common enemy.
The film is visually stunning, particularly the scenes of dragon's in flight. This isn't a belly laughs kind of movie, but my kids and I were engaged in the storyline throughout and there are some funny moments as well.
As a sidebar, there are several references to Odin and Thor (as in, ""Odin help us!"") and my sons wanted to know who those guys were. If you've got kids who ask a lot of questions, be prepared to explain they were Norse gods.
Overall, this was a good film. It requires a little thought about right and wrong and taking responsibility for one's actions, which is never a bad thing in my book.",1294185600,2,2346,4.572446555819478

It was a most enjoyable film and the characters were charming, including the dragons.  The voice of Craig Ferguson added to the enjoyment.  Being a 69-year-old woman I didn't expect to be so entertained by an animated film.  I would recommend this film to anyone regardless of their age.

4836509,5,B005MQWJPG,"I had to go with that title, because this movie just IS perfect, at least to me.  I simply can't think of anything that would make it better.

I'm pretty conservative with giving movies 5 stars. And frankly, DreamWorks animated films usually leave me cold with their lack of subtlety, their overuse of ""bathroom humor"", the general tendency towards hit-you-over-the-head obnoxiousness, as contrasted with Pixar movies, which tend to be more - what's the right word? - classy. (With the exception of Toy Story 3.)

BUT this one hit the right mark and goes straight into my Favorite Movies of All Time list.  It manages to be exciting, subtle, endearing, hilarious, awe-inspiring, poignant and thrilling.  The beginning, the middle, the end and everything in-between are all just right.  So, so rare to find that.  Need I mention the animation and graphics?  Jaw-dropping.  The soundtrack?  The production design? The script? The voice-acting? The story itself?  And ohhhhh, the dragons!  Can't resist.  Have to go with awesome!  And while it's wonderful for kids and all, this is a movie that adults should enjoy just as much if not even more, and they'll finish watching the movie feeling better than when they began it.

4836519,4,B005MQWJPG,"This is a graphics feast for your eyes. There is a lot of breath taking wide shots of meticulously created seaside and mountain top scenes. It takes you on a virtual ride on the back of a dragon and the film is a thrill ride in more ways than one.

The story centers around a youth called Hiccup (Jay Baruchel also of Sorcerer's Apprentice) who is an under-achiever as far as the ways of the Vikings go. Unlike his father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler also of The Ugly Truth) who is a much accomplished fighter and dragon killer, Hiccup is more of a brains than brawn type of guy.

With his technical skills his is able to construct a device that is able to capture the mysterious Night Fury dragon (that no-one have ever been able to capture or kill). However, the device damages the dragon's tail, and he is no longer able to fly properly. Hiccup soon constructs an artificial tail piece for the dragon, and then he also makes a harness for the dragon and learns to ride it.

Each time he goes for a ride on the dragon, it is like a surreal adventure in the skies. The adventure element of this film is pretty high, but there is also a lot of action sequences as the story develops.

The voice acting is superb, and Jay's voice of uncertainty/frustration adds depth to his character and conveys his odd situations quite well, Gerard also does a very good job.

The underlying message of this movie is not to judge anyone too quickly without knowing the full circumstances under which they are making their decisions.",1291593600,2,1519,4.469314079422382

4836521,5,B005MQWJPG,"This is a great, great movie!  My whole family loved it.

It begins right in the middle of the action. It has great pacing.  The main character is trying so hard to make is father proud and yet he is not at all what his father expects him to be.  There are so many great moral characteristics explored in this movie: friendship, loyalty, altruism, bravery, expectations, honor, responsibility, coming of age, etc...

Hiccup (the main character) isn't perfect.  He does sneak out of the house, disobey his father and such, but he really does try to protect not only his father and friends, but also his entire village.  So these make for great conversations if you lean toward trying to discuss the characters bad choices.

This is also a great movie about not fitting in exactly (along the lines of Meet the Robinsons or Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.)  With so many options today like Netflix streaming, I've become a lot more selective about what movies to actually buy for our home movie library.  How to Train Your Dragon is a no-brainer though.  Great movie for the whole family. Highly recommended from this mom & dad, 11 yr. old son, 9 yr. old daughter, 5 year old daughter and 2 yr. old daughter.",1291507200,6,1208,4.598130841121495

It shows that things don't always end perfectly, that adventure can be dangerous, that there may be a large price to pay for being different or for trying something that no one has ever tried before.  But it also gives the message that even bad things can have a plus side.  For older kids the message may be too simplistic.  For little kids, however, the ending shouldn't be too scary and gives a positive twist.  I liked it.",1291420800,3,597,4.422018348623853

Hiccup has been led to believe that all dragons are evil and must be killed before the dragons kill them.  Believing what he's been hearing, Hiccup makes a special weapon of his own to bring down one of the feared dragons.

Hiccup manages to bring down a night fury; the most feared dragon of all.  But instead of being excited for his deed, Hiccup feels bad for the injured dragon.  Soon, the two have become close friends, and Hiccup has named him Toothless.  In no time, Hiccup has fashioned a saddle and is soaring high in the sky on Toothless' back.

But, Hiccup still has his father to deal with.  Stoick, thrilled at Hiccup's bringing down the dragon, has insisted that he begin formal dragon training.  The only thing that Hiccup likes about it is that he gets to be near Astrid (America Ferrera).  During the course of his training, Hiccup begins to learn that the dragons aren't really evil at all; they are just like the vikings, hoping to survive.  However, convincing his father will be another matter.  Hiccup and Toothless soon discover that the dragons are merely pawns in a larger game controlled by a huge, menacing creature.  Will Hiccup, Astrid, and the others be able to save the dragons, or will the creature destroy both the dragons and the vikings?

I've seen numerous animated movies with my children, and I have to rate ""How to Train Your Dragon"" as one of the best.  The special effects are excellent, and the story is good, too.  I enjoyed watching the relationship develop between Hiccup and Toothless, and the comedy left me laughing out loud.  My three kids are big fans, too.  For a fun family movie, watch ""How to Train Your Dragon"".  Highly recommended.",1291075200,4,1958,4.702941176470588

4836540,5,B005MQWJPG,"With a review title as ambitious as mine, some justification is definitely in order.  See unlike Pixar (with a little help of the Disney promotion machine), animated hits with the potential to become pop culture icons aren't a given for DreamWorks.  Sure they've had Shrek but ask anyone and you'll discover that 4 feature films and a variety of spin-offs have milked the franchise past its worth.  Kung-Fu Panda came next with signs of brilliance.  Proponents however were quick to point out the fact that marital-arts references simply aren't universal enough (however hilarious) to challenge the clever-ness of your average Pixar piece.

Enter How to Train Your Dragon, a 2010 animated work based loosely on a 2003 children's book by Cressida Cowell of the same name.  Coming in at a runtime of 98-minutes, Dragon gained enough critical acclaim to warrant a video game series, a sequel planned for release sometime in the summer of 2013, a Cartoon Network animated weekly series beginning in 2012, plans for a live-tour, and the Blu-ray earning a spot in Samsung's Home 3D Starter Kit.

I was vaguely aware of the hype surrounding this one going in, and even so came away absolutely dazzled with the end result.  But before digging into what it is that makes this motion picture a crowning achievement, let's assemble a small summary of the plot, shall we?

The story takes place in a mythical Norse world called Berk and follows the exploits of a skinny Viking teenager named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel).  Residing in a land torn by constant threat of brutal dragon invasion, Hiccup finds himself struggling to gain the approval of his gruff father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler).

Insisting on entering into battle (to prove his valor), Hiccup ends up using one of his inventions to take down a mysterious and highly feared Night Fury class dragon but is seen by the villagers as only the cause of unnecessary destruction.

The next day, after tracking his fallen prey, Hiccup is faced with the fact that he can't bring himself to kill the beast (and hence instantly gain the respect he wants most out of life).

Instead, Hiccup and the black dragon, whom, thanks to retractable teeth he dubs Toothless, forge a friendship that leads to his discovering that humans have misjudged the entire species.

Further complicating the relationship is the fact that Hiccup finds himself enrolled in Dragon Training; a gamut of human versus captive dragon barbarism that ends with one of the students having to slay a dragon before the blood-hungry town.

It turns out that in Berk, just like in reality, a better understanding of one's enemy can often prove more impactual than centuries of doing battle with them.

So if right now you're thinking this all sounds cute and clich&eacute;, rest assured that there is charm in this one no summary will be able to capture accurately.  The direction and pacing are absolutely spot-on here, so much so in fact that it often becomes difficult to even remember that this is an animated film (often considered the ultimate compliment to any animator).

The characters and corresponding cast is marvelous with enough passion and range to keep the viewer's attention precisely where it should be (on the story).

Visuals, as one might expect on a film that cost an estimated $165 million, are stunning- especially the fire effects and flight sequences (that look amazing on the home screen in hi-def even without the much ballyhooed 3D).

Additionally noteworthy is the fact that overly expressive animal eyes and the development of the bond between Hiccup and Toothless is conveyed here virtually without dialogue, which suggests that DreamWorks has been paying close attention to Pixar's mastery of the medium.

John Powell's score adds to the delicious flavor with its heart-thumping tension on down to heart wrenching intimateness and everything in between.

In all, even a film as hyped as this one can stand to have a bit more praise heaped upon it simply because it delivers in just about every conceivable level.  Truly the business-model driven DreamWorks has its masterpiece that even the nerd-farm that is Pixar need be envious of.  Don't miss this, one of the finest specimens the genre has to offer!",1290556800,3,4251,4.963328631875881
4836541,5,B005MQWJPG,"This is the first non-Pixar animation that I can give 5 stars to (well, maybe the second - I thought ""Bolt"" was pretty good too). Especially when they advertise it as ""from the makers of Shrek"" (which I thought was a bore). They infused it with all the subtle mannerisms and facial expressions that give it that added level of realism and amusement. The animation effects are first rate. It really makes me wish I had seen it on the big screen and in 3D. Most of the bad reviews come from those who said that it strayed too far from the book. I never read the book and loved the film. I was glad that ""Up"" received the Oscar, but after seeing this, I now know that the competition was a lot closer than I had previously thought.",1290470400,3,728,4.244604316546763

4836544,5,B005MQWJPG,"(Don't worry, no spoilers!) I was, first off, flabbergasted by this beautiful film. That looked, frankly, in the ads, like a forgettable animated throwaway. The dragons looked ugly. The clips emphasized the pop culture references of 'Madagascar' and 'Shrek' in ways that didn't look BAD, just shallow. I'd seen it before. So I stayed away.

Boy, was I dumb. Meet one of the year's best films, animated or no. A beautiful and moving journey that addresses war and peace, man and animal, love and hate, and even disability and wholeness. The dragons are not ugly, but are more like birds and bats (with a dash of cat!)--squat and weird on the ground, yet gorgeous and graceful in flight. Toothless's flights make the flights in 'Avatar' look clumsy, honestly (and I'm not dissing 'Avatar,' I totally enjoyed it).

The flying sequences are gorgeous, poignant, joyful and moving. These scenes are something special. When a character runs a hand through the air above them, blissfully, feeling the feathery cool, previously untouchable, clouds against their fingertips, it's almost impossible not to feel their joy.

""How to Train Your Dragon"" is, in fact, an utter delight, a moving and witty and incredibly deep exploration of people and animals, no less, who dare to envision a different outcome for themselves. (Yeah. I cried.)

The growing friendship between the misfit boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless is eerie, quiet (nearly wordless) and gorgeously depicted--helped enormously by John Powell's lovely score. It will remind many, in fact, of the quietly humorous scenes in Carroll Ballard's classic ""The Black Stallion"" over three decades ago.

I found myself so invested that I held my breath more than once. And did I cry at other scenes? Heck yeah. And filled with wonder, at some of the eeriest and most beautiful moments I've ever seen in an animated film.

What I loved about the writing for HTTYD, along with so many other animated favorites of mine, as well, was that there was this obvious care taken with the script and story. Because every animated moment costs so much, every moment matters. Everything comes together in a satisfying and literate way. Watching it made me wish more live-action filmmakers took half as much care with the stories and scripts they create. (I love movies in general -- always have -- but honestly, the past 4-5 years, I'm lucky if I like even 2 or 3 a year anymore.)

Two other things that really struck me in the film:

1. The repeated refrain of ""I did this."" It's said several times throughout the film, in happiness, regret, disappointment, etc., and it's a really subtle way of empowering the characters. They take responsibility for what they do, for good or ill. I really like that.

2. The fact that Toothless and Hiccup are a mutual support system -- friends whose challenges mirror each other's. That's all I'll say. But the last 5 minutes of the film I found incredibly unique for a kid's film. And really moving and poignant. There is a deep love between boy and dragon that will resonate for anyone who's ever had a much-loved pet. Sometimes that bond can seem like mind-reading. They simply know what you need, and provide it.

All I'll say, remaining vague, is that I was in tears for the final 5 minutes of the film, and the emotions were too complex to name. There's regret, joy, love, and acceptance. That's enough for me.

And best of all, [the ending of this film] really packs a wallop yet is utterly unpreachy. It's just the satisfying culmination of a really well-told story. And for a cute little animated movie that I kind of expected to forget almost as soon as I watched it, that totally knocks me out. There's a lot of depth to this story, and I found myself thinking about it even the next day. It's awesome when that happens.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1290384000,11,3848,4.761261261261262

4836549,5,B005MQWJPG,"To begin with, I'm not a fan of Dreamworks at all. It's not their animation quality that bothers me... I never paid attention to their animation vs. Pixar until I saw How to Train Your Dragon. What bothers me about Dreamworks is most of their movies come out really crude and indecent. I suppose it's not a big deal for everyone, but I steered clear of Dreamworks as a rule and rolled my eyes at anything that `Dreamworks was making.' I don't want any kids that I might someday have watching Robots, Shrek, or KungFu Panda (thought Panda was better than Robots, I will admit as far as content goes).

When I look for a good movie I look for cleanness (no implications, crudeness, etc. or if there are those elements how prevalent are they? Are they always around the corner or is it a `there was one little part' not even 10 sec. long?). I also look for a good, meaningful and sentimental story. I love friendship themes (like in LotR); I love characters that grow; I love characters who are so driven to desperation and/or sad that they're lonely and sad. I can feel more for them if there is something to pity.

I watched Eragon expecting JUST that: a beautiful friendship, cuteness, and epic noble/adventure. I got less then three minutes of it, and hated the movie because of how dark it was. Dark in a way that I felt sick (trust me, I've never seen Twilight, never will, but I saw a 10 sec. clip at Wal-Mart and had nightmares three nights in a row). I don't like dark stuff, so Eragon was definitely off the list of `likes.' Three minutes of some pretty neat scenes with Eragon and his pet dragon wasn't sufficient for the movie to pass the test.

I had `heard' of How to Train Your Dragon and thought it was a `race around like a show-off-cool-dude and somehow do something that's not really noble, but Hollywood will make the hero be rebellious but somehow noble for somehow saving the world in a really stupid way.'

So with my outspoken `blah' prejudice against Dreamworks (I'll tolerate IceAge if I'm in a good mood), when the kids I was babysitting brought the DVD to watch and I saw `Dreamworks' I had red flags going up right away. `Dreamworks. Uh-huh! THAT'S not going in Mom's DVD player.' Then to be `fair' (after all it had dragons on it, I like dragons as a writer of fantasy who has a darling little character who has a pet dragon name Drzarr) I thought: `let's see what it's rated. If it says anything about crude humour, it's not going in. Period. Action? Violence? BRIEF language? Are you serious? Is this really Dreamworks?'

By then I started getting hopeful, `maybe I can get one or two ideas from the movie for my book that might *help* my book a little.' I put it in, and was coming in and out while cleaning the bathrooms. `This is Berk...' I thought that was a pretty clever `intro' with a voice over from Hiccup. You see all you need to see, and you find out just from his stance/part in that scene where he stands with everyone. I saw instantly that he had the potential to be a weasel, sappy kid (I can't stand sissy guys), but he had chance enough to redeem himself. After all, it wasn't that he was afraid of dragons. He was made different, he was built different, he TRIED until he almost killed himself trying to do what the others do-- fight dragons. He's not afraid of them; he's just not gifted.

Sure it's clich: kid doesn't fit in. Father hates the fact: `excuse me barmaid...' It was different though. You like Hiccup; he is brave; he just can't do what he tries so desperately to do.

Once I saw Hiccup faint after being `screeched' at by Toothless, I was giggling and couldn't wait for the bathrooms to get clean so I could sit DOWN and watch it. By then my brothers and sister were standing there laughing and saying: `this looks SO good!' My brother had to go run an errand and didn't want to.

Everything goes on: Astrid and all the other Viking teens are clich. Astrid is the `I can totally take care of myself'; Snotlout: `I'm buff, I'm cool.' Ruff and Tuff: `we bicker, we don't read.' Fishlegs: `I'm a videogame junky (speed 8? Plus 5 speed)' And yet, you didn't roll your eyes; it was really new and different. You enjoy the characters, most of the time. I don't appreciate Ruff and Tuff's comment about Hiccup or Astrid. You can ignore that-- by then I was a little worried: `I hope there's nothing else like that. This is turning out SO neat!'

And for the I-Hate-The-Eragon-Movie's-Guts goose (me) because there was no real meaningful friendship between Eragon and his dragon, I was in for a real treat when the scene Forbidden Friendship came up. I had chills. I was so happy. I was laughing because some of it was funny, but mostly because it was so cute and heartwarming. I laughed for delight, and the music was sweeping me away. If I ever get married I'm using the soundtrack title Forbidden Friendship for my bride's maids and for myself!

And when Toothless started drawing like Hiccup I was going: `aaaaaaaaaaaawwwwww! How stinkin' CUTE!'

After that scene I knew I would definitely buy the movie. It only got better. The parts with Hiccup discovering all these `dragon secrets' was wonderful-- we laugh every time (and we've seen it 10 time in less than 2 weeks). Test Drive was-- *I have shivers at the thought* epic! I can't describe how beautiful it was. I love epic scenes-- not to be confused with action, (blah!) I don't care about action-- give me characters who grow-- but I love epic/nobleness of it all. I don't even like car-chase/hotrod scenes. I couldn't get over how neat the hotrod scenes of Hiccup on Toothless was. It was so neat! It was breathtaking, ended perfectly by Toothless's little triumphant blast of fire and Hiccup's slouching: `come on!'

Not So Fireproof was a dear scene. I love it to pieces.

I did predict a lot of what was going to happen; I saw Astrid on the cover of the movie: `she'll discover his dragon; he'll have to convince her Toothless is okay; she'll like Hiccup then; they'll come back and tribe will discover Toothless anyhow; and then there'll be a mess.'

The Green Death was a completely new element I wasn't expecting. But it was brilliant. I love that sequence.

The Kill Ring and how Toothless comes to rescue Hiccup. My heartstrings are attatched to anything sweet, sentimental or anything along those lines. I was transfixed when that scene came up, and when I saw the Vikings tackling Toothless I was like: `great scott! Now Hiccup's going to have to tame Toothless all over again because Toothless won't understand-- that movie just lost two stars!' (I hate movies where animals start `distrusting' after so much trust). I was fully expecting a Smagol `men hurts us, master tricksed us' little play and then Hiccup would have to fix that friendship and trust all over again. There was none of that-- I was open mouthed as well as delighted.

So they defeat Green Death, and wow, I was so happy to see Toothless going down to save Hiccup from falling into the fire. And then the `Where's Hiccup' scene is beautiful. I liked it that Hiccup didn't `hiccup' a little cough and wake up. It was more dramatic and touching that the audience gets the idea that he's honestly, seriously hurt-- so much that he doesn't wake up till he's at home again.

And did I tell you how much I laughed for delight over Toothless going nuts in Hiccup's house? We have a cat that looks and acts just like Toothless (we also have a cat that is just like a Gronkle-- fat, cranky, lazy; and another cat that is really like a Bone Knapper-- she knaps washcloths when she's lonely); so that was endearing.

I love the hotrod flying scenes at the end and Hiccup's re-narration of `This is Berk...' `The only plus-sides are the pets... ...we have dragons.'

So... clichd characters? Yes: but with different twists that make them new and unique. Hiccup is a hero who proves himself over and over; he's smart-- just not gifted the way the others are. He can't slay a dragon to save his life, but he can tame one, ride one, and understand what they are and realize that it's the Vikings antagonizing them. Some people might say that's overkill on the `stupid kid ends up being really smart.' Well, no, not really, I think it's okay; sometimes the misfits who watch movies like that will feel more for the Hero if he's a misfit because he is different.

So... any suggestive words? A few... brief; it's ignorable. Overall you feel for Hiccup and Toothless-- you feel so sorry for them; you cheer when they triumph; you laugh for delight over their perfect friendship. I'm just barely 21, and I love this movie; yes, it is my favourite animated/cartoon. It's up there with LotR and Narnia. Seriously. The humor/wit is clever and we laugh hysterically. Our whole family goes around quoting that movie to death: `excuse me barmaid!' `Thanks for nothing, you useless reptile.'

Should you watch this movie? If you like Narnia, LotR, or fantasy, yes. If you like animals and think they're cute, yes. If you like sweet, sentimental, friendship movies, yes.

The only downside? Well, this last summer before I had watched the movie (I only saw it two weeks ago from today November 18, 2010) I had decided that `my dragon will act like a cat-- cute, purring, etc.' I saw HttYD and thought: `that is NOT fair! I haven't even told anyone except my sister about the cat idea and they stole the idea! OH well, at least I know it's cute and people like it!'

But, I give Dreamworks a big thumbs up. For being one of their 'works' I was surprised; there was actually depth to the movie; it was a real story, not just a piece of dispicable junk like Robots (I still don't remember the point of that movie, I was so disgusted by it).

From now on, any Dreamworks movie that comes out will be carefully approached without the former prejudice! Three cheers for you, Dreamworks! I love this movie. I look forward to watching it a hundred more times!

I've only just orders the Art Of (this movie) and the soundtrack... as a fellow artist who draws pictures for her story, that was a must! And as a lover of music (soundtracks: LotR, Gods and Generals, North and South BBC, Enya) the music blew me away. I'm listening to it right now. It feels so epic and beautiful, you could see it being the soundtrack for something like Narnia or LotR (my sister and I lament Narnia's music wasn't like this) despite the fact that the Rohan fanfare fiddle is the fiddle that graces the Hiccup-Astrid theme. The soundtrack was an instant 'my book themes are just like that!' (I assign my characters music themes) :)",1290038400,3,10571,4.536482939632546

4836562,3,B005MQWJPG,"Basic story is that a young Viking, from the North on the Island of Berk, who was keen on hunting trolls, gets his opportunity at an elusive dragon. When he confronts his Viking ways he must decide for himself weather to dispatch his prey or will he come to an understanding of the true nature of the beast.  If you own cats you can see the dilemma and the conflict. Not that any feline is in danger of being dispatched.

There is nothing unique about this movie.  The story is old as the hills. The animation while not intrusive to the message is not unique either. There are no news truths or insights or anything.  There is the standard minus and a boy coming of age with others attempting to do so also. It is refreshing to find the single family parent is the father however it is the old single parent family conflict. The one big flaw in the story is that the only dragon that could use befriending was targeted for dispatching by everyone including fellow dragons; what kind of message does that send?  I have to admit I did not read the book so I cannot compare the book/movie.

On the positive side they picked some good voices (see the DVD extras) for the individual characters. They did not constantly bombard the movie with unrelated background music. There attempt at cute contemporary dialog works pretty well. The dialog was not drummed down as most of the later Disney movies.",1289088000,,1393,4.507936507936508

4836565,5,B005MQWJPG,"Call me a sucker for animated films, but I can't help it.  They're almost always a win in my book, as I usually find myself engrossed in the world of CGI.  DreamWorks new feature, How to Train Your Dragon, fits great into the scads of computer-animated films that I like to say I enjoy.

The story takes place on the island of Berk.  Young Hiccup, the Viking chief's son, is a walking disaster.  Everything he touches breaks.  Even venturing outdoors often invokes fear and awe in the villagers.  Hiccup is a scrawny lad, lacking all the rugged muscle and bulk all the other Viking's have.  His father is the most famous of all dragon slayers, and though Hiccup longs to be like everyone else, he's hampered by his physique.

But Hiccup has more than just daddy issues to work on.  His village is constantly attacked by dragons.  They come in the night and steal their livestock, burning down the homes as they fight the mighty Vikings.  One night, during an attack, the dreaded Night Fury, a dragon so mysterious and dangerous that no one's ever even seen one, shows up.  Hiccup, in an effort to prove himself, decides that he will capture and kill the Night Fury, thus earning his father's respect, the admiration of the town, and the heart of the cute little blond Astrid he's had his eyes on.  While the village is occupied with the dragons, Hiccup sneaks away and launches his plan, and things will never be the same...

As I mentioned, I really like animated films.  They seem to pack more of a punch than many live-action movies.  Mayhap this is because we feel a little safer when dealing with imaginary situations.  Maybe it's because we see them as children's movies and we let our guard down.  Whatever the case is, many of the computer-animated films deal with heavy issues (see Up if you don't believe me).  How to Train Your Dragon was no different, dealing with daddy issues, self-confidence, and moral objection of societal views to name a few.  And while movies like this often have ""feel good,"" happy endings, I don't feel cheated or mislead when I see them.  No, I cheer.  Our lives have too many problems as it is.  If I can see achievement and accomplishment in someone else, even if that someone is a computer-animated Hiccup, then I can find meaning and apply it to my life as well.

This movie is different from other CGI films, too.  I was expecting a lot more comedy (like Shrek) thrown in with the adventure, but instead it was the other way around.  The worldbuilding is massive and creative, filled with possibilities for adventure, and our hero finds himself on one.  The movie does succeed in delivering funny jokes/scenes, but honestly I was more excited about the plot.

My favorite thing of the film, however, was definitely the dragons.  (What fantasy reader can resist dragons when they're done right?)  The writers have imagined many different kinds of dragons.  Some are small and dorky looking.  Some are fierce monsters as large as a building.  Some have thick scales.  Some have multiple heads.  All of them were visually stunning and beautiful.  Yes, there are plenty of dragons in the movie, and my favorite was definitely the Night Fury.  This dragon reminded me of my pet dog Stella.  Some of the mannerisms and actions were identical, so it was hard for me not to like the Night Fury.  In addition, the relationship between the dragon and Hiccup was endearing and heartfelt, harkening up familiar feelings to anyone that's ever owned and loved a pet.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  I watched it in 3D (as we had my 8-yr-old brother-in-law with us), and it was impressive, but plain-ole 2D would have easily sufficed.  DreamWorks has some failed movies in its past, but How to Train Your Dragon isn't one of them.  I can easily recommend the movie for anyone who wants to be thrilled and entertained.  To me, it was worth the full-price of the movie ticket(s) on a weeknight, so that's saying something",1288828800,,3956,4.677793904208999
4836566,3,B005MQWJPG,"I've been recommended this film many times since it was released, and it has tons of glowing reviews, so I expected to love it.  I'm obviously in the minority, but I do not think this even comes close to rivaling a Pixar film for quality.  My husband and my mom watched this with me (no kids).  We have enjoyed many Pixar films, but all agreed this was disappointing.  Yes, this is an excellent film for kids, but not for adults.  I did love that the dragons had cat-like characteristics.  It was an interesting take on them that brought some humor to the story.  Plus, the graphics were top notch.  Visually, the movie is great.  However, it is the story that falls short.

This felt like a 30 minute film had been stretched to an hour and a half.  The entire first hour was very slow, even boring at times.  It's almost 45 minutes in before Hiccup even starts training the dragon.  And the story has a ""been there, done that"" feel.  Scrawny kid that no one respects, bullied by his peers, uses intelligence to save the day.  A great lesson sure, but lacking originality.  Plus, none of the characters stand out besides Hiccup.  After watching the film, I cannot recall the name of any other character besides him and Toothless!  What saved the film for me, and the reason I gave it 3 stars, is that the last 20-25 minutes were fantastic.  It was a very exciting, action-packed happily-ever-after conclusion. I would watch that part again.  Overall I am glad I did not pay theatre prices to see this.  I understand that a sequel has already been green-lit. I might give it a try if it has a more original storyline.  Recommended for families.",1288828800,4,1643,4.517006802721088

4836568,5,B005MQWJPG,"Hiccup is a Viking ahead of his time. He is able to look at his own society much as an outsider would view it (Similar to ""Eric, the Viking""). The village is besieged by dragons, but such is life for a Viking.

Hiccup, as an intellectual Viking creates a weapon that is able to injure the infamous Night Fury Dragon, one that has never been seen by his people. Hiccup tracks the injured dragon on his own, however is unable to slaughter it when it lays defenseless trapped in ropes from his own weapon. Rather he cuts the dragon loose. They become friends as he brings it food. Hiccup splits his time caring from the dragon he names Toothless, and attending dragon school. He learns secrets by about dragons by caring for one.

He applies what he has learned to dragon school, much to the amazement of his fellow students and instructors, becoming a child hero and legend. There is a young blond Viking lass he wants to impress. The plot is predictable and the movie is wonderful.",1288656000,,980,4.5
4836569,5,B005MQWJPG,"Craig Ferguson's voice is a perfect natural for this 2010 release Viking based, animation film, ""How To Train Your Dragon.""  Yes you need to bring your imagination and let go of being too much of an adult as you view this 2010 release.  Dreamworks gets a big kudos from me for their efforts sharing the epic story of Hiccup (Viking young lad) befriending a dangerously lethal, special forces dragon he names ""Toothless"" (retractable teeth).

We all have a sentimental romantic concept of what and who the Vikings were back there in the Dark Ages from 800 A.D. to 1000 A.D. with their two handed battle axes that could split armor and shields with ease, arriving by longboats in or around regions such as Constantinople, Iceland, Russia, Greenland, Newfoundland, Ireland, Britain and other parts of Europe known as Scandinavian (Norse) savages, explorers, warriors, merchants, and pirates, and one of my favorite depictions of those rough hewn enduring epic folklore people was brought to the screen in a 2005 film named ""Beowulf & Grendel"" starring (pay attention) Stellan Skarsgard, Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson, Gunnar Eyjolfsson, Philip Whitchurch, Ronan Vibert, Rory McCann, Hring ur Ingvarsson, Elva Osk Olafsdottir, Olafur Darri Olafsson, Steinunn Olina Persteinsdottir, (I'm not kidding) and one other name that helped make this earlier epic saga film authentic and believable, which of course was the outstanding actor Gerard Butler.

Well, heed my warning about that 2005 version of ""Beowulf & Grendel"" being not for the squeamish or easily-given-nightmares type viewer.  THAT film isn't animation, it uses real people, with real places, and realistic terror.  Although not as terrifying as the 1999 release of ""The 13th Warrior"" with Antonio Banderas (also an epic saga about Vikings), ""Beowulf & Grendel"" (2005 release with Gerard Butler) still has its moments.

On the other hand, ""How To Train Your Dragon"" is animated.  Therefore it by default isn't intended to be as frightening to the point of heart stopping dread and intrepidation.  It still can be pretty scary at times though for any child under 10 years of age.  The ancient dragon king that comes out of the abyss can be interpreted by impressionable minds as equivalent to the devil out of hell (which is terrifying for the deeply religious).  I'm just giving you a heads up for that potential, I'm not saying it was intentional by the makers of ""How To Train Your Dragon.""

Gerard Butler is the voice of a main character (the dad) in this 2010 animated film, and has obviously studied the Viking culture.  Whereas I will readily agree you can't help but fall in love with the dragon dubbed ""Toothless"" I also have to add my perspective that it isn't only the weak, frail, timid, and outcast kid (who fails at almost everything else) who can and does have wisdom and empathy enough to consider sentient life worth respect and having a charitable ""live and let live"" objectivity as a good way of discovering that everybody else's enemy isn't necessarily your enemy too.  But putting aside the idea that a fierce, deadly, gruesome ""night fury"" dragon can be trusted unconditionally to love a helpless boy enough to team up with an otherwise useless failure personality and become heroes (which has a spectrum of connotations that almost gave me an aneurysm), if you can overlook how a father who disowns his son and gives up on mentoring him to be equipped for survival and acceptance among his own people, then later on after the son does the most rebellious, against-the-grain thing imaginable, the dad tells him how he's proud of him, well then if you can overlook those details, then yes this is a good movie.

The point I'm trying to make is you can over analyze anything.  This movie is supposed to be an escape from reality, softening and conquering what frightens us, overcoming brutal ignorance from those who would barricade our dreams, and making friends out of otherwise potentially deadly enemies.  Come away with Hiccup to an island called Berk, where he wins the heart of his overly macho village champion father by making friends with a few of the dragon creatures who make a habit of destroying their homes and food supplies, and maim their fellow villagers who manage to survive.  Try to forget the psychological impetus possibilities off on whatever tangent, and just enjoy the awesome depiction of camaraderie that you don't have in your own reality.  It is a cartoon for crying out loud.  Let go of logic, and step into fantasy.  You know, like believing your boss knows how valuable you are on your real life job.

Very enjoyable, fun, and I wish I had a dragon friend like ""Toothless.""  Buy this DVD movie and enjoy it over and over with the family (except kids under 10 who might have nightmares).  Bravo Dreamworks.",1288569600,2,4807,4.935483870967742

4836572,5,B005MQWJPG,"Although, This is an animated movie, It still has a somewhat theme from the Blockbuster Eragon. Riding Dragons. We start the story with a village Idiot, named Hiccup. Who always screws up, one way or the other. He shoots down the legendary Night Fury, and everyone thought he was lying(but he wasn't). Hiccup was on a search mission for th Night Fury. He found it and was going to kill it, but he couldn't because the dragon was scared. He keeps visiting the wounded dragon, and forms a friendship with the dragon. He start to learn how to fly and becomes somewhat of an expert, He starts to call the dragon, Toothless. He win the training and is forced to kill a dragon, but the dragon attacks Hiccup, and his friend/Pet Toothless rescues him from the dragon and is capture by his people. They used Toothless to find a nest of Dragons, they believe is responsible for their troubles. Hiccup knew what is hiding in the nest, a Godzilla-type dragon hides in there. He sets up a rescue mission to save his dragon, and his people from the Godzilla-Dragon. This was one of the best animation films I have ever seen, that gotten a lot of good reviews. It wasn't the first. Alpha and Omega, may have gotten a ton of bad reviews, it still did pretty good for Box office releases. It may have been in 5th, it beats not having to have nothing.

Yet Hiccup does not inherit the strong burly momentum that his father does. So instead of going up against his tribes enemies, the dragons he is sent to work as the lowest of the low in the fight, until he decided to accidentially trap one of the rarest of the rare. When his father finds out he did he is proclaimed a hero and when he finds his catch he tries to do something none of his tribe has ever done...learn to befriend it and understand it. What Hiccup uncovers is a major secret in the world of Dragons and that there is a way to put a stop to years and years of rivalry.

This movie will make you laugh and make you feel true emotions as it portrays a classic Father Son tale. The cast is amazing from the leading role played by Jay Barruchel all the way to Craig Ferrgeson.

A truly fresh take on an ages-old plot, with probably the finest computer animation to date.  Although somewhat predictable, the plot, action, and emotional involvement only get better throughout the picture; no anticlimaxes or lame ending here.  Hiccup's warm sarcasm, hard-working character, and take-it-on-the chin attitude are very constantly likeable.  Toothless the Night Fury is a CGI masterpiece, and his unique and spellbinding 'performance' makes him one of the most immediately loveable characters invented for the screen - ever.  He is a rare piece of truly original and beautiful design in a time of re-hashed, copy-cat, crass, run-of-the mill animation.  The relationship that develops between the main characters happily surpasses the medium of 3D animation and stamped plastic DVD and his truly well written and heart warming.  The humor is also well timed and appropriate, understandable to children and adults alike (The 'breastplate' gag is real winner and tactfully presented).  But, best of all, this one readily endures repeated viewing as it is not too long, the plot moves along quite well, and the CGI work is enthralling - especially the final scenes.  Pick up a copy, make three bags of popcorn, have a great evening with your family, and send the kids off to bed smiling at a decent time.",1287964800,,1431,5.1072961373390555

4836591,5,B005MQWJPG,"How to Train Your Dragon ( loosely based on a series of novels for children by Cressida Cowell ) is one of the most clever and engaging films I have seen in ages. The story arch: brilliant, wordplay: brilliant, Hiccup's sophisticated outsider view of his Viking world: brilliant; the message of the story; brilliant I haven't been overly impressed with Hollywood in the past couple of years, so I was delighted to discover this.

The film is surprisingly empowering: Hiccup, the burly Viking chief's son, is the scrawniest Viking in his clan. Apprenticed to the local blacksmith, Gobber the Belch, Hiccup is more than resourceful, but his physiognomy and disposition hinder him from excelling at the most prized Viking trade: killing the dragons that plague the morose village of Berk. The dragons are pests: they fly in, scoop up the sheep, set things on fire and fly out again. The Viking chief, aptly called Stoick the Vast, and many of the brawniest of the clan's teenagers have no trouble fist fighting the large reptiles.

Hiccup, however, is clumsy and kept from dragon training and forced to stay in the forge and belch out weapons to help his kinsmen defeat the monsters. Stealing a catapult one fateful eve, Hiccup downs a Night Fury: the most dangerously elusive dragon of all. Called a hybrid of lightning and death, Hiccup knows that proof of the dragon's demise would win him the regard of his father and his townspeople. On finding the dragon alive, however, and looking straight into his cat-like eye, Hiccup is unable to perform the task and thus begins what is the most charming and giddy and wonderful plot I have seen unravel before me in a long time. The movement and curiosity of Hiccup's new dragon friend ( named Toothless for his ability to reign in his large teeth) as well as his facial expressions make me want a dragon as a pet.

Kids will be delighted! In fact, in my audience, many audibly were! Hiccup becomes an unlikely hero merely by challenging the norm of his Viking society and characteristics. Moreover, it is Hiccup's lack of physical strength and his brains and compassion ( and not, as is customary, what he calls his ""raw vikingness"" that ultimately saves the day). A lesson on ignorance and prejudice is indeed blatent here. But, so is a lesson on actions and consequences. Not everything ties up neatly and Hiccup has a large price to pay for standing up for what he knows is right. This may sound odd ( seeing as we are talking about a film centered on a boy and his dragon) but this film had an emotional resonance that stayed with me a long time.

I am sick of kids' flicks wherein heroism is drawn by some supernatural or fantastical power ( Yawn, Harry Potter, Twilight and the lot). Hiccup is smart, mortal, resourceful, self-deprecating and very, very perceptive and funny. I guarantee any one who has ever felt that their giftings were different than the rest of their clan, so to speak, will find ultimate validation here. Also, there are some FANTASTIC lines including the following: ""Trolls exist. They steal your socks. But only the left ones. What is with that?"" Adorable.",1286928000,6,3130,4.748161764705882

4836593,5,B005MQWJPG,"""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a fantasy adventure film from DreamWorks Animation. Unlike hilarious ""Shrek"" (I'm talking about the first one), the company's new computer animated film does not rearrange or subvert the genre's conventions much. Instead, with the straightforward narrative suitable for the material, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" tells a good story in a compelling way; in short, thrilling actions, likable characters and great animation.

Set in the Viking village of Berk, the story begins with a young boy Hiccup (voice by Jay Baruchel, ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice""), who wants to be a real warrior, despite his obvious lack of skills, if not courage. One night, during the dragons' attacks on his village, Hiccup sets out to fight on his own with a weapon of his own making though his father and village leader Stoick (Gerard Butler) orders him to stay inside. Hiccup's reckless action results in the friendship between him and a wounded dragon the Night Fury or ""Toothless.""

The story takes an unexpected turn when Hiccup realizes that dragons ""have to"" raid the village. The film is orthodox in its storytelling - a son who wants to impress his father, a feisty girl who wants to prove herself, rivalry and romance between them, etc. - but with the well-drawn characters you relate to, the film is never boring. Also, the film's exciting aerial sequences should not be missed.

""How to Train Your Dragon"" is directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, a team known for their joyful Disney animation film ""Lilo & Stitch."" The film adaptation of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is exactly what you expect from the creators of those two lovable characters. Enjoy the ride.",1283990400,11,1681,4.953900709219858

The 3-D effects along with the color & graphics blended with rich scenery were mind blowing and I had to actually look away during some of the battle scenes (yes, it was THAT intense for me).

4836599,1,B005MQWJPG,"How they could misrepresent the books so badly in this movie I can't figure.  My son and I saw this movie and were distraught with how they had ruined a much better story from the book(s).  Everyone's so impressed with the CGI, so what?  The characters are entirely different and 100% more interesting in the books.

The character development in this Dreamworks film is no different than any other CYI film - totally unoriginal!!  Snotlout, for example, is nothing as odious as the character in the book, and looks like he was copied from Buddy in the Incredibles.  Who the heck is the girl?  What's her role in this: oh yes, to fill the girl support stock role, I forgot.  Give me Camicazi any day (see the books) - a totally original and unpredictable female character.  How could they have emasculated Gobber in such a way?  Why wouldn't they get better voices with Scottish accents (hear the audio CDs by David Tennant if you want to know what I mean).  Oh, and by the way, that isn't Toothless, it's Windwalker.

If you read the books you'll realize how many great elements have been lost in the untelling.  I'm thinking I'll stick with books, they're so much better than the influx of mediocre, impaired CGI stories that are coming at us every week.  And what were they thinking by taking off his leg at the end! They have also made it impossible to stick with any of the future book story lines.  I would say the leg scene is too graphic for small children!

I really don't understand the author - did she lose control or just go for the cash?

Nevertheless, I strongly recommend the books and audio CDs.",1280534400,52,1611,4.5190311418685125
4836600,5,B005MQWJPG,"We meet Hiccup, the unlikely Viking hero in the animated movie How to train Your Dragon, as his hamlet is being attacked by dragons, once again.

The dragons sweep over the village setting the thatched roofs afire and breaking havoc among villagers and sheep alike, while the warriors retaliate with arrows and mighty blows of mallets and swords.

This, Hiccup tells us, is how things are, how things have been for as long as everybody remembers.

Hiccup, who is the chieftain's son, wants to kill a dragon and prove himself a warrior, but being scrawny and uncoordinated, he has a novel approach. To his father's dismay, he builds sophisticated devices to shoot at them. And this time, he succeeds. He shoots a mighty dragon out of the sky. And not any dragon, but a Night Fury, the fastest and deadliest of them all. But when the time comes to kill it, Hiccup hesitates, and a friendship is born between dragon and human.

That summer, while the Viking warriors go into yet another quest to find the dragon's legendary nest and Hiccup and his peers learn how to fight against captured dragons, Hiccup trains his dragon.

The return of the defeated warriors and a timely discovery sets humans against dragons in a final battle that will destroy them both unless Hiccup finds a way to stop it.

How to Train Your Dragon is, no doubt meant for children, but it has a lot of charm and a strong story, not to mention a sympathetic protagonist, a cute dragon, and a girl with the coolest outfit (check her boots) this side of animation. So if you need a family movie to watch with your kids, give How to train Your Dragon a chance.

4836603,5,B005MQWJPG,"DreamWorks has hit an absolute homerun with How to Train Your Dragon.  Holding its own against anything from Pixar, the animation is nearly unparalleled.  The story of Hiccup (Baruchel), a gangly Viking teen with pipe-cleaner arms, is one of courage, understanding, and acceptance.  When all other Vikings are learning to engage in war or actually battling the evil dragons alongside Hiccup's conspicuously-named father Stoick (Butler), young Hiccup must ignore his fears and unfortunate name to show the others a more delicate and ultimately superior approach toward winning over the dragons.

The primary draw of HTTYD is of course the animation.  One scene in particular shows multiple characters flying over an ocean that literally made me want to dive in.  The waves, the colors, the breakers, the motion, it was all perfect.  The water itself could have been replaced in any non-animated movie and not a sole would have noticed.  The rest of the animation came in a close second, with amazing detail in every blade of grass, every eyebrow raise, every gust of wind.  Stunning.

Not simply a movie for the kids, this is perfect for all ages.  It's truly wonderful, with all facets of comparably good films represented.  The score is magnificent, allowing a viewer to be absorbed into the action.  The characters are well developed, diverse, interesting, and heartwarming; they blend perfectly.  The story itself is a classic tale of underdog winning by unorthodox methods to save the day, become famous, and get the girl.  Nearly everything works together seamlessly.

In my opinion, there are only minor negatives of the film.  First and foremost, Jay Baruchel's nasally, whining voice fits the character, but comes across as fingernails on a chalkboard.  The other flaw as I see it, and it is admittedly minor, is the grayed moral relativism.  The primary antagonist was doing nothing wrong, merely surviving, and I couldn't help but compare her/it to Bambi's mother as an innocent character who met its demise.  Is it only sad when an ugly character or creature suffers?

Nonetheless, I can't praise this movie enough.  I give it my highest possible recommendation.  There is a story and lesson for every age.  DreamWorks has really produced an outstanding movie that deserves repeat viewings.

4836604,4,B005MQWJPG,"How to Train a Dragon is a coming of age movie. The usual stuff. The overbearing father, with the son who embarrasses him because of his lack of mini-me-ness, tries to force said son to man-it-up and get on with it already. Son does the one thing he can think of to impress his whole village but screws even that up. But while doing so he discovers truth that will change everything his dad, his whole village, his whole world believed. Add humor, fighting, action and a few scary moments, make it animated, throw in a love interest and lots of dragons and you've got an entertaining movie. My Viking fanatic friend would have a hissy regarding the Viking hats. Apparently the Vikings did not have horns on their helmets. But I digress.

My one complaint. It's a kid movie with enough stuff to draw in the adults and keep their attention, too, but they took it beyond dragons. There is a mini makeout scene. And the tough girl love interest throws out some very realistic stand-in ""cuss"" words during a temper tantrum. Not needed. I don't know if those elements are thrown in for teens, to get them interested. But for the 8-10 year old little boys, all it would take is the dragons....",1278720000,5,1186,4.5162790697674415

The music is perfect, the cinematography is great, and the story is touching. There are not many female characters, but the ones who are in the movie are strong, independent, and treated like equals. There is also an underlying theme about accepting individuals with disabilites. I can not think of another children's movie that has three major characters with prosthetic devices. I love that Hiccup's success is not attributed to him simply being smart. The movie clearly shows the work that go into his inventions and the many failures he has before finding successful designs.

In the movie, a scrawny Hiccup would do anything to show his fellow Vikings that he has what it takes to fight off the local threats - dragons. Too bad his efforts usually end up worsening the situation. His status as an outcast is only made worse by the fact that his burly dad, named Stoick no less, is the town's chief and embarrassed by his son. But in his attempts to prove that he can kill with the best of them, Hiccup befriends a wild dragon and discovers that what he and the Vikings know about the creatures is completely wrong.

This was yet another film I had no intention of seeing, but for some reason the bf really did (something about good reviews or whatever.) Well I was captivated from the get-go. You quickly get wrapped up first in a boy's wish to belong and then in the bond between him and his dragon as if it were any other domesticated animal. The climax had me on the edge of my seat, freaked and clutching onto his arm (dragons are no joke, people), but that's when I understood why Alice in Wonderland just wasn't up to par with work like this. This was what good 3D looked like; the movie truly came to life. It sucked you in and the flames engulfed you.

It was good enough for me to go and watch three times, though the only time I saw it with more than just me in the room was when a mother brought her two young kids to see it. I felt a little uncomfortable at first being an adult watching it alone, but that didn't last long once the movie started. I guess what got me interested in the movie in the first place was that I love dragons, which is no surprise. The movie is great to me just for the vikings being able to find peace with the dragons and co-exist, but it was also the simple things that made this movie great. The animation was amazing, and if you love 3D, you have to see it in this movie. I thought the voices for the characters were perfect as was the emotion. The story of the movie was great and well told and the lessons to be learned from it were powerful. Also, when it gets to the parts where those lessons would be revealed, those moments hit you hard. I was struck with the moment when Hiccup learned that the vikings knew so little about the dragons, although they knew so much about their war abilities. Plus, the moment at the end was powerful as well and you'll feel that one no matter who you are.

4836618,4,B005MQWJPG,"""How To Train Your Dragon"" may be the best non-""Shrek"" animated film DreamWorks has produced. It is a funny, charming, well-animated film using 3-D to enhance everything about it.

A small Viking village constantly battles a number of dragons that repeatedly attack their small seaside hamlet. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel, ""She's Out of My League"", ""Knocked Up"") is the thin, slight young man who wants to play a bigger part in his town's defenses. But every time he steps outside of the family cottage, he ends up causing trouble. His dad, Stoic (Gerard Butler), a big, commanding Viking who is in charge of the town, wants him to remain at the blacksmith shop, under the watchful eye of his friend, Bogger (Craig Ferguson). But the dragons continue to attack and they need to train new recruits, so Stoic sneaks into a new training class and meets Astrid (America Ferrera, TV's ""Ugly Betty"") and they form a rivalry. Bogger throws every species of dragon at them and Astrid handily beats them while Stoic has to pay attention to keep from tripping over his own feet. One night, during an attack, Stoic tests an invention and seems to strike one of the infamous black Night Flyer dragons, hard to see when they attack at night. The next day, he escapes to the forest and finds the felled beast. They form a friendship, naming his new friend Toothless, and Hiccup begins to learn how to handle the beasts that have plagued his village for so long.

Directed by Dean Debois and Chris Sanders (the team behind ""Lilo & Stitch""), ""Dragon"" takes a welcome step back. Instead of trying to make everything super-realistic, the film is designed to look cartoonish. The male Vikings are big, but top heavy with broad chests and full beards. Hiccup is a tiny, gangly kid. Each of the types of dragons is different with a personality of their own.

When Hiccup meets the Night Flyer dragon he has injured, he first tries to kill the beast, but he is unable to. Dubbing his new friend Toothless, they start to form a friendship and Hiccup learns about the other dragons his friend knows too well, using this knowledge to impress Astrid, Bogger and ultimately his father, Stoic.

As their friendship grows, Hiccup learns the dragons are really just trying to protect themselves. In fact, they would rather just fly and play and cavort through the skies and forest. Just as this happens, his dad, Stoic, leads a group to infiltrate the hidden dragon lair, they have finally learned of the location. Hiccup tries to intervene, but his dad is determined to put a stop to the attacks.

As Hiccup and Toothless become more familiar with one another, they become friends, and eventually play with one another. These scenes are the most endearing to me because Toothless (and the other dragons for that matter) have the characteristics or kittens and puppies. Toothless' behaviors and mannerisms could have been modeled on my cat; he prances around and pretends to hide, playfully waiting to attack Hiccup, a sly grin on his face, ready to roll around and play. The animators have done a great job of capturing this look and feel and translating it to these creatures, making them appear more familiar to us.

Jay Baruchel does a great job providing the voice for Hiccup; he perfectly captures the pre-adolescent gravely voice reinforcing the fact he is barely a teenager, yet he lives in a society forcing these kids to become men before their time. Despite his scratchy voice, he is eager and willing to become a Viking, to fight the dragons, to use his inventions to help his father and their fellow villagers battle these beasts. Later, when he meets Toothless, he realizes he has something he never had before. A friend. Also, his friendship with Toothless provides him with an empowering freedom he has never enjoyed. As Hiccup rides his new friend, they fly through the skies. Initially, Hiccup is terrified, but he quickly learns to appreciate this newfound freedom. In fact, he seems to savor the new freedom.

Gerard Butler's gravelly voice is perfect for Stoic, the leader of the Viking village. At times, his voice is so 'Scottish', you might mistake it for Mike Meyers doing a riff on his ""Shrek"" voice. In fact, I initially thought it was Meyers, as I watched the trailer the first few times. Later, when I learned it was Butler, it seemed odd two animated films from the same studio would have such similar voices. But watching the film, I quickly forgot these initial thoughts and went along with Butler. Butler's voice is so thick he seems the perfect choice to play the leader of this Viking kingdom. His character is exaggerated in the right places (overly broad torso, tiny waist, big arms), giving him the most complete feel of a cartoon character I have seen in some time.

Craig Ferguson is also good as Bogger. Honestly, I didn't realize it was Craig Ferguson providing the voice for this character until I read the credits. Often, movie and television stars appear in animated films and simply retain their own speaking voice. When this happens, you have to ask, ""what's the point?"" If they aren't going to add anything to the character, couldn't anyone play the part? In Ferguson's case, he does a great job building a character and hiding himself behind the faade of this Viking's voice.

America Ferrera plays Astrid. Astrid is a fun character; a woman in a male-dominated society, she constantly wants to prove herself and make everyone realize how tough she is. As she has a reputation among her classmates, she is confident she will be able to excel at the dragon taming classes. She knows everything and is fearless enough. But Hiccup begins to use his newly acquired knowledge and quickly becomes the star pupil. Astrid becomes jealous and inquisitive and sets out to find his secret.

Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse play the other two students in the class. They are OK, but don't really have enough time to create very memorable characters.

""Dragon"" combines a lot of elements typical to animated films, even some things that could be considered stereotypical or overdone. The beauty of this effort is these same elements are handled with a great deal of skill, making them seem interesting, seamless and believable. At the heart of the film is a fairly standard story about a boy trying to prove to his dad he isn't a loser. We've seen this a million times, but in this film, it seems more endearing somehow. Perhaps because the characters are so un-realistic and ""animated"", the film reminds us we are watching an animated movie, we are basically watching a moving picture book. And because of this, I found myself remembering simpler, more magical times.",1273276800,4,6686,4.810269799825935

I wasn't going to go, being this was just another animated film. Boy, was I wrong! It held my attention throughout the nearly 100min. My daughter is an art school graduate and love the film on many levels, including the technical perspectives and approaches. Both her and her mom will sit through the closing credits, as they did last night.

Okay, we ducked in the Borders before they closed and latched onto the soundtrak. Today the Art of Training your own dragon. The DVD when it comes out.

I felt like I was flying with that kid. I felt the adventure. I needed the boost and the escape.

We are helping our daughter realize her dreams. Us, movies like this help us to recapture our dreams

All of you folks that got something out of this movie, never give up on your dreams. And let your kids teach you to fly dragons.",1272499200,15,961,4.292817679558011

4836621,5,B005MQWJPG,"""How to Train Your Dragon"" -- I saw this animated film on an Imax screen in 3D, and it was a delightful experience. The setting is a Viking village where the men are big, brawny, husky warriors, and the wives are pretty imposing as well. The village is besieged by dragons in all sizes, shapes and colors who swoop down and take away livestock and anything else edible. Hiccup is a nerdy kid whose father does not have faith in him as a dragon-slayer. The kid does bring down a dragon, but no one believes him.
 He goes hunting for the downed dragon and finds that he has only wounded it, shot off one of its tail fins so it is unable to fly. The kid miraculously befriends the dragon, and clever boy that he is makes a new rudder-operated tailfin for the dragon. The boy learns that dragons are basically friendly, and they can be tamed and made into pets.
 The scenes where the boy on his home-made saddle goes soaring through the air on the back of the dragon are worthy of scenes in ""Avatar."" He wins over a girlfriend by showing her his prowess with dragons. The boy is clever, resourceful, a good artist, and compassionate.
 Most animated films made primarily for children have worthy lessons to impart which are embedded in the story. They don't preach but they do teach. Hiccup's super-macho father comes to admire and respect the boy's skills, and they are brought closer together.
 The movie is a mixture of daredevil action sequences, comedy, pathos, and the need for empathy between man and natural creatures. Kids, I think, will learn a lot about Viking ships, costumes, customs, food, and the world of the early Norse society where men were men, and the women were hefty too.
 The movie becomes somewhat cutesy in the old Disney style when the dragon becomes endearing and coy. I highly recommend this movie for all.",1271721600,,1830,4.584097859327217
4836622,5,B005MQWJPG,"I can't wait to own this movie! I saw the preview while attending another movie. I thought it looked like it might be fun. So I asked my boyfriend if we might be able to see it. He wasn't really up for the idea of seeing what he thought to be a silly animated kids movie. I own a retail store where we sell fantasy gifts and jewelry. Dragon related items being among them. I love dragons and always try to have the coolest ones. I really wanted to see this movie. My boyfriend finally said... ""If you really want to see it we'll go."" I really don't ask for much. This I wanted. Without giving anything away, at one point in the movie I got a little teary eyed. My boyfriend noticed,  leaned over and whispered in my ear, Me too. The movie was great! At the end, I kid you not!
My boyfriend said.... ""That was a wonderful movie! I'm so glad we came."" The story was interesting and entertaining enough for adults. The animation was amazing! So even if children of a very young age couldn't quite follow the story,  they could still very much enjoy the colorful characters and action. I would highly recommend this movie, and I feel safe in saying so would my boyfriend. We are both in our late forties, and still very young.",1271462400,4,1222,4.285714285714286
4836623,5,B005MQWJPG,"If I could give this movie more stars I would have.  It is an amazing work that is at the same time full of heart and action.  The writers did not sacrifice one for the other.  The movie has a surprising depth to it also.  Not just in the relationship between boy and dragon, which is magnificent, but in the many other relationships played out during the film.  It is a great family film.  If children are young be sure they don't scare easily or wait on it till they are older. I will watch this film again and again!  Enjoy",1271462400,4,526,4.148514851485149
4836624,5,B005MQWJPG,"I LOVED this movie! I am a dragon collector from long ago because our school mascot was the dragon. Since 1954 I have been entralled by dragon design, dragon antics, dragon effects on audience, dragon expectations, dragon portrayal, etc. All of which made this movie a delight and horizon-bending. I must admit, I was completely and pleasantly surprised by the story, the personalization, and the portrayal of, especially, the main dragon character. I had never thought of dragons with feline attributes, but it worked! Never have I linked any of my hundreds of dragon designs (Eastern dragon serpents, Western dragon dinasaurs, Loch Ness dragons,fire-breathing menace dragons, Puff the Magic Dragons, Lollipop dragons, etc.) to my beloved cats, but Toothless definitely revealed a kitty prototype. Interesting. Fascinating.

The one reservation I have is for the one-eyed or single-vision movie goer. I was sorely disappointed and irritated when I could not understand the profound audience reaction to some of the intense 3 D scenes. That is not a fault of the movie, but I think I would have liked to be warned that I would be handicapped by my monovision. I was not able to see in 3 D--duh! You would have thought I would have known--having only one eye to see from. But I didn't. I felt cheated because I could not respond with the obvious intensity that my fellow watchers did. But that's MY problem, not the movie's.

I am on the waiting list to purchase the movie for my library and for my dragon collection--no less because the movie speaks to other kinds of physical handicaps in an unexpected and thrilling way. Ooops! Almost gave too much away. That would spoil one of the best parts of the movie.

Go see it.",1271116800,2,1721,4.8668941979522184

It is just a whole lot of fun from start to finish, and it has a great tone to it - very fun, exciting, and funny as well. I loved the animation, the voice work, the story, the characters, heck pretty much everything. But overall it's just a whole lot of fun, moreso than any other animated feature I can recall. The critics reviews do not do it justice. It's a very spirited romp. Loved it. Definitely going to see it again!

4836627,1,B005MQWJPG,"1) Making the main characters too ""modern"". The kid had an ""emo"" 2010 haircut that will look dated 2 years from now.

2) Making the dragons into basically cute puppies, or otherwise have the same mannerisms as dogs.

3) Lame ""simtcom-my"" acting by the characters (created by the 3d animators.) Specifically the scene where the dad gives the boy the hat, and they sortta act uncomfortable. This same lame situation can be seen thousands of times on every ABC sitcom.

4) The boy character has an annoying ""juno-esque"" sarcasm and ability to be smarter than all the adults in the world.",1270944000,30,584,4.762376237623762
4836628,5,B005MQWJPG,"There's so much to like about this that I'm not even sure where to start. First, the animation: Superb, as always, and things like hair and fur just get better at every turn of technology. Second, the plot: inept boy makes good despite the wrong-headed grownups, and the cute girl likes him in the end (as does everyone else).  Third, the misfits who just happen to fit together very well. You'll find out about that when you see it. Like a great chef making wonderful pastry from ordinary ingredients, Dreamworks cooks up these common elements into a delectable treat.

So much for the big things, which all come together well. The little things really make this movie. For instance, there's the grizzled old wardog explaining that he lost his leg to a dragon because he's delicious, but that's just one moment in the ongoing banter. The fearsomely capable girl is good too, even if that role has become a commonplace. She'd whomp our hero at any known skill, so he comes out ahead using unknown skills. The awkwardness between dad and teen son has warmth enough, in a way that might bring the viewer's own past awkwardness back to life for just a moment. The dragons have as much personality as the humans, if not more, together with a few charming feline traits. And the hat ... again, you'll have to see that one for yourself.

Art, story, characters: it all comes together in a great family entertainment. I'll see this one again.

4836630,4,B005MQWJPG,"Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), a puny Viking boy wants to kill dragons to impress his fellow vikings and to prove he's as tough as one of them.

But can Hiccup get the point across to his macho dragon hunting father (Gerald Butler) ?

  How to Train Your Dragon is easily one of Dreamworks best. Hell, I think I even enjoyed it more than anything else they have done. The movie is funny, exciting and even some-what moving. The animation is also top notch. The story may be similar to live action dragon films like Dragonheart and Eragon but this movie is much better than both of those films. The story is better executed and the action is more exciting.",1270684800,2,842,4.454545454545454
4836631,5,B005MQWJPG,"Not since Dragonheart have I seen a movie with the mythical creatures that was actually worth watching. How To Train Your Dragon is a wonderfully entertaining children's movie, but is just as fun for adults who grew up dreaming of Dragons. Hiccup is a loveable hero who does what nearly every child has ever wanted to do: meet and ride a dragon. The story of friendship and belonging is one that can be appreciated by adult and young audiences who have ever (and who do still) loved dragons and the magic that seems to roam with them.

The movie is sweet, intelligent, fun, and heartwarming. The characters are likable, the Dragons are amazing and the animation is breathtaking. John Powell's score only adds to the wonder of this film. And there have been few movies I have seen that have kept the child-sized audience so quiet. So enthralled is everyone in the movie that few even bother to make the noise generally heard when a young audience gets restless half-way through a story.

The story is amazing, the visual graphics breath-taking (the best 3D I've seen yet!), and suspenseful parts keep you on the edge of your seat! I was extremely pleased and impressed with the movie (and my husband calls me a movie critic becuse I will criticize every movie I see). I will certainly buy it the day it is released on DVD. That said, this is not a movie I would show young children. The opening scene is of a village being attacked by dragons, and there is a whole lot of fire and explosions. The suspenseful parts mentioned above might be way to much for a young child to handle. The final scene is even more exciting/violent than the begining, and the ending is shocking for an animated film (though quite emotional). I would caution parents to view the movie before sitting their children in front of it. But for me, this is a new favorite and I highly reccomend it!
