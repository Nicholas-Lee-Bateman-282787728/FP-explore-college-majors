Excels in 2D and is Excellent in 3D. Popular for Relaxation videos and the huge & growing interest ib sealife, the disc covers many species.  It's in itself a Necessary addition to any Ocean Lovers, library.

Sharp, Clear Visuals of Vivid Beauty are it's strong points. Throw in Extensive filming o various  fish, corals and often a Different take to the vast display of creatures. Perhaps it's due to having German Producers. Whatever the reason, magnificent results, abound..

Musical Accompaniment is Very Nice, the Documentary part, easy to follow. The only Negative is lack of a LOOP feature, which allows, easy use as a TV Aquarium.

If you Love Beauty, nature, sealife,  coral reefs, or just need something to lower your blood pressure, look no further. One of the Best on the Market.

I use these to test and compare blu ray players.  This indeed is a primo choice, with color and contrast to the Maximum!",1365897600,,1139,4.860103626943006
5384583,3,B00A6OLT32,"If you have viewed Imax:Deep sea 3d or Imax undersea adventures than this movie is hardly going to do anything more for you than either of those other two films have done, you definately are not going to find that scene that makes you feel like your purchase was worth it.

With Imax Deep sea you had multitudes of scenes where the 3d depth wasn't only great but those occasional Pop Out scenes that made you say OMG! that was cool... not to mention the audio quality of that film paired by entertaining narration made it worth every penny.

With Undersea we had one of the most significant 3d pop out scenes ever, the one scene alone made it worth owning the entire disc.

Unfortunately this release was kinda flat to me, it had some okay 3d depth but nothing near what the other underwater films have brought to 3d, the pop out was very limited as the only things that appeared to pop out were the fish left in 2d as they were closest to the front, but this is more because of the added 3d depth in the background and not because they were made to appear popped out. The only genuine pop out effect was the fishes poop and other particles floating in the water throughout the film I literally waved my hand in my face a few times cause It was like having a nat/fly/misquito near your eye which is more of an annoyance.

To make matters worse the audio in this is almost entirely boring as for the better part of the film it has some bubbles new age sounding music/ambience playing and could easily make one ready for bedtime. The pacing of the film is equally dreadful having the narrator talking about clownfish than changing subject then okay were back to clownfish again. the film paced itself terribly as it randomly changed subjects and just felt forced almost as if the narrator had a gun pointed to his head and he was being forced to speak.

The film isn't entirely bad but it definately lacks what others have brought to us in the past, nothing that makes it a must have can be found here whatsoever, The only thing it managed to do was be crisp and free of ghosting with exception for one small scene showing black clown fish the white stripe did create some ghosting but it was miniscule and easily overlooked to the normal viewer. So the only thing this film did better than any other in its underwater documentary category was its lack of ghosting but then again it took no risk and came out flat overall.",1357948800,18,2420,4.4049217002237135
