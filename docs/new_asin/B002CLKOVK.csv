8364125,1,B002CLKOVK,"This film is incredibly dull, boring, mind-numbing at times and NOT a thriller, as the cover suggests. It lacks any depth for psychological games with viewers. The story as it is could have been packed into a 30-minute short film.

Now, some might say the protagonist had to go through is own journey to become a tough guy like his father, but falls sadly short and goes postal instead, but I don't see that kind of depth here. It is simply a long journey to nowhere - as the title suggests.

The only audience who might really enjoy it are splatterpunk fans, who may appreciate the gory torture scenes.",1258848000,,603,4.522935779816514
8364126,5,B002CLKOVK,"""No Through Road"" really sneaks up on you to deliver a brutally fun wallop. The story starts simply with a meek photographer finding a terrified girl hiding in his house one night. She claims she's been raped by three thugs who now block the only exit out of the cul de sac where the photographer lives. But, is the girl telling the truth or is she hiding a larger secret?

What begins as a psychological tug-of-war between those in the house and those outside eventually turns into a bloody confrontation when the thugs go to extreme lengths to get the girl back in their clutches. The photographer isn't quite sure who to believe, but makes a stand to protect the seemingly helpless female.

The action gets quite gory as the plot progresses, but what makes the film really shine are the strong characters and the terrific, twisty script by director Sam Barrett and Robbie Studsor that keeps the audience guessing as the gore starts to really splatter.",1253145600,,954,4.706586826347305
