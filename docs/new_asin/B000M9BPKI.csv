8749825,4,B000M9BPKI,"I watched the first Secret Skatepark Tour after watching all of the Tony Hawk Gigantic Skatepark tours.  I enjoy the skating as much as I enjoy the off day antics of the mad crew.

I really wanted this DVD to see Rodney Mullen doing some of the tricks I only dream of.  He's there and seems like such a neat guy.  Most of the crew are there as well.

For some reason I felt this was a lot shorter than the other DVD, but I am not sure if that's right.  Watch the extras, especially for the one called 'Get it Petit' about one of the cameramen who also skates.

All in all it's well shot and edited like you'd expect, but I just felt that it was shorter than the first one in terms of skating content which is why it doesn't get 5 stars.",1213747200,,736,4.0
