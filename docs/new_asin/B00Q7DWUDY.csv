6859284,4,B00Q7DWUDY,"As you've probably surmised, LEVIATHAN is not the film to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting, nor is it for those who crave fast action with lots of dizzying twists and turns. Nevertheless, this film brilliantly incorporates a fairly simple, straightforward plot with a rich variety of complex themes, and while it may seem slow-moving to many, it's truly gripping and full of surprises with a quietly powerful soundtrack. It has much to show about the futility of trying to fight fire with fire. It moves at such a natural pace that it often seems slice-of-life, but there remains a solid beginning, middle, and end to this story. Certain key events that most Hollywood films would show in graphic detail are left out of the picture, which will disappoint some viewers; all the same, these omissions serve a definite purpose. With special mention going to Sergey Pokhodaev as young Roma, a truly sympathetic character, the acting by all is as immediate and real as acting can be, which helps to convey the subtle, complex, and ultra-intelligent development of virtually every character here. Without being at all heavy-handed, it espouses certain Christian ideals, skillfully contrasting them with the frequent hypocrisy of the church organization. LEVIATHAN is obviously no comedy, but it's far from completely humorless. Set and filmed in a small fishing town near Murmansk in northwestern Russia, the scenery is as bleak as most of the other elements. But again, this only serves to enhance the sad realism of a film that's not easily forgotten.",1430265600,39,1572,5.05
6859285,4,B00Q7DWUDY,"Leviathan (2014 release from Russia; 140 min.) brings the story of Kolya and those around him. As the movie opens, we see Kolya, a 40-some guy, leave his isolated but beautiful house to pick up someone from the local train station. Turns out to be Kolyas friend Dmitri, a lawyer in Moscow. Dmitri is helping out Kolya to try and stop the local mayor from taking Kolyas house and land by eminent domain (supposedly to build a communications center). We get to know Lilya, Kolyas (second) wife, and Roma, his 12 yr. old son, as well as his circle of friends. Then one day, at a picnic, Dmitri and Lilya are found out as fooling around, which enrages Kolya. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev, whose previous film, 2011s Elena was equally top-notch but in a very different way. Where Elena was intimate and small scale, Leviathan is brash and epic. Second, ""Leviathan"" is set in Pribrezhnyy, a remote village near the Volga river, some 500 mi. southeast of Moscow. Rugged but beautiful, the village itself feels like another character in the movie. Third, much has been made about the political undercurrent of the movie. It is interesting to see that as the opening credits roll, the Russian Ministry of Culture is listed prominently as one of the primary money sources for the movie. Did the Ministry scrutinize the movies scenario beforehand? What is clear is this: the movie spares no-one, and in particular the local politicians, judiciary and clergy all get the heavy treatmentbut no mention of Putin is made whatsoever. (Since the movies release, the Minister of Culture has disavowed the movie, and going forward has promised to crack down on any such similar movies.) Fourth, the overall bleakness of life in todays Russia (at least as portrayed in this movie) is striking. Everyone drinks like a fish and smokes like a Turk. It leads to some unintended hilarious scenes: at a dinner party where everyone is drunk out of their minds, a woman asks her husband: are you okay to drive?, to which he mumbles drunkenly: uhuh, Im the traffic cop!, ha! In another scene, where the guys are practicing shooting their guns at empty bottles, one of them suggests better targets and shows them portraits of past Russian and Soviet leaders, which sounds lurid but it plays out just funny (""I've got a Yeltsin in here somewhere!""). Last but not least, pay close attention to the scenes involving the local priest, who encourages the reawakening of the Russian soul Bottom line: this is one heck of a movie, and surely one to stay with you long after you have left the theater. This movie has very deservedly won a BUNCH of prizes, including at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival (where it premiered), but also the 2015 Golden Globe for Best Foreign Movie, and was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar (it lost out to Polands Ida).

The movie played at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati for a couple of weeks in March, which is when I saw this. The early evening screening when I saw it was attended okay but not great, which didn't really surprise me, That said, this is one of the VERY BEST foreign movies Ive seen in the past year, and there is a good reason why this has garnered so much critical acclaim. If you have a chance to see Leviathan, be it on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, by all means do no miss it. Leviathan is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1430092800,5,3539,4.688102893890675
6859286,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"This is a powerful, intense, and forbidding Russian movie directed by Andrey Zyvagintsev. This film was inspired by Marvin Heeymeyer of the United States who was outraged over the outcome of a zoning dispute in Colorado and was adapted into a Russian setting. The story takes place in the coastal town of Kolya on the Barents Sea. The main character is Nikolai a fisherman ( Aleksey Serebryakov) who is forced to fight back in the courts when a corrupt mayor Vadim ( Roman Madyanov) tries to seize possession of his property that has been in his family for generations. Nikolai enlists the help of his old army friend Dmitri (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) now a enterprising lawyer in Moscow, to help fight the illegal repossession of his property. Dmitri uses compromising documents against Vadim, but it only stops the ruthless mayor for the moment. Nikolai's life begins to unravel when he learns that his wife Lilia (Elena Lyadova) and Dmitri are having an extramarital affair while Vadim finds a way to use his superior resources and power to seize the property once and for all to build his development.  The film is mesmerizing: story, characters, setting, cinematography, acting, directing: from beginning to end. When you are watching this movie on the big screen in the theater you are one with it, all distractions fade away. This movie is a beautiful work of art. I purposely left out some of the storyline because I think it should be revealed while you are watching the movie.",1429833600,11,1483,4.884920634920635
6859287,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"Simply put, Leviathan is a masterpiece in every respect. It is a cinematic parable about Russia: Class, religion, drinking, autocracy, guilt, fear and hypocrisy. It is easily the best film by Andrey Zvyagintsev, of several, and easily the best film of 2015 by a mile (sorry, Birdman, you didn't fly at all). The cinematography is extraordinary, editing perfect, acting so natural, you would think you were in Novosibirsk, and the musical score riveting. There are more metaphors to leviathans in this film, than can sink a ship, but that's OK, because they are integral to this Chekovian tale of greed and loss. The ONLY mystery is why Putin did not ban this film in Russia, as it is hardly complimentary to current and past leaderships. Unlike most Russian films that touch on the Russian Orthodox Church, it is also not very complimentary of Church hierarchy and I don't think Solzhenitsyn would have given this film five stars, given it's religious cynicism. I saw this when it first came out in Washington, DC, and ordered the DVD as soon as it was released. For the serious and artistic filmgoer, this is a MUST. The opening and closing of the film is as haunting, as the cold night wind in a Siberian winter. If you want to understand what Russia does, and understand what it doesn't, you must NOT miss this film. It is flawless.",1429401600,98,1335,4.733905579399142
6859288,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"Leviathan (2014) looks like a movie that could have been easily made by an Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke.  It has this very Haneke-ish feel to it...and those people who are familiar with Haneke's film-style know what I am talking about.  To quote Haneke on his own work: ""My films are intended as polemical statements against the American 'barrel down' cinema and its dis-empowerment of the spectator. They are an appeal for a cinema of insistent questions instead of false (because too quick) answers, for clarifying distance in place of violating closeness, for provocation and dialogue instead of consumption and consensus.""  So there you have it.

Leviathan is a story about life, or rather mediation on life and its hardships.  It is a story about  Kolya (former fisherman now a car mechanic) living in a small village/town in one of the picturesque northern provinces of Russia, near Finland.  Kolya lives in a big wooden house with his teenage son Roma and his younger concubine Lilia.  Kolya is going through some difficult times in his life.  He has to deal with his difficult son, who is not accepting Lilia as his new mother, and on top of that the entire family is about to get evicted from their home...Kolya confronts the problem of eviction by calling on his long time friend/lawyer Dmitry, who comes to Kolya's help all the way from Moscow...from there the events turn from bad to worse...

Here are some professional reviews of the movie:

""It's a cry of despair and soul-shaking desperation, leavened with shades of Dostoyeskan  angst""--MIAMI HERALD (2014)

""Simultaneously a modern essay on suffering, an open-ended thriller, and a black comedy, it is most importantly of all a thinly-veiled political parable drenched in bitter irony that takes aim against the corrupt, corrosive regime of Vladimir Putin""-- THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER (2014)

WELCOME TO RUSSIA !!!",1426377600,2,1884,5.074675324675325
6859289,4,B00Q7DWUDY,"On the remote Kola Peninsula, near the Russian border with Finland, Kolya lives in the house he built with his 2nd wife and son from his first marriage. The corrupt mayor(Vadim)of the local town wants to acquire the property for redevelopment, but with the help of a childhood friend, now practicing as a lawyer in Moscow, Kolya attempts to resist the compulsory purchase. The first half of the film seems to be the fight of David vs Goliath but due to the insertion of adultery and vodka drinking it doesn't quite live up to this. Also the woman's role seems to be diminished to be the bearer of pain. Kolya's son has no respect for his step mother.

Kolya asks, pleadingly, ""Why, Lord?"" during a moment of suffering, but religion offers neither answers nor hope. Indeed, it is a priest who expressly persuades Vadim to stick to his guns in the land dispute, to regard his own power as synonymous with the divine one. The cards are stacked against the working classes. Any opposition (even with a lawyer)or protest is crushed by the local mafia. Might becomes right. Injustice flourishes like the wild waves crashing around the shore. Kolya becomes Job. The fatalism means Kolya will never triumph against the system. There is a beautiful scene where the son sits by the skeleton of a whale on the beach. Hilarious court scenes show a judge offering a speedy monologue without time for questions or breath.

This story heavy with symbolism of the fusion of power and religion is emphasised by the title(with allusions to Thomas Hobbes's book,which states man because of his pride and passions be submitted to government).The power of the governor(the mayor) is compared to Leviathan. Without a contract between governed and governors life becomes `nasty,brutish and short.' There is a scene where they have portraits of ex-Soviet leaders to use for target practice and Kolya asks if they have anything current. The policeman replies that the current one can ripen a little longer on the wall. Obviously they are talking about Putin, Medvedev etc. Also, on the TV at Kolya's house you can see something about Pussy Riot (just the name), but the fact the movie links state corruption with the church's hypocrisy makes you think this is a statement of support by the director.

We also get the glimpse of whales in the Barents sea and the playing of Phil Glass's music from Akhenaton. With the current idolisation of Putin by ordinary Russians this film is very topical(we get shots of Putin looking down from a portrait on the wall).The film offers a savage portrait of the corruption and lawlessness endemic in contemporary Russian society. How this film got past the censors beats me. Maybe the authorities don't care how they're perceived by the West. Maybe they still need the revenue knowing it would go down well in the West. Yet I
feel the film doesn't quite live up to its bleak cosmic scenery and poetic cinematography.",1426118400,,2927,4.838323353293413

6859291,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"A film in the darkest Dostoeyevskian tradition, a modern Russian version of Job: very much like the Coen Bros. ""A Serious Man,"" but without the irony.  This is a straightforward account of injustice crushing upon one man: as the world judges him, squeezing the life out of him blow by blow, the world in turn is weighed in the balance and found rotten to its core. State, church, and private power combine in a nexus that leaves no room for justice but in the next world and even that is gamed.  Although the story can be taken as a microcosm of ""life in Putin's Russia"" (with the obligatory photo of El Presidente in the Mayor's office) its theme of corruption and injustice is universal and by no means unknown in the happy little place where you live.

The measured pace does not detract from the film, nor the extended opening and closing shots: nature goes on its timeless way as if none of this story happened or its people mattered.  Perhaps that - as opposed to the false arrests, infidelity, betrayal, and violence suffered by its characters - is the film's most disturbing element.  This Russian tragedy is a solid counter to the moralistic, can-do happy ends demanded in Western literature, a product of a place with a sadder but wiser take on humanity.",1500940800,7,1264,4.625

6859300,4,B00Q7DWUDY,"Leviathan is a Russian Drama set in a coastal town. The story follows events that surround Kolya (Aleksey Serebryakov) his second wife Lilya (Elena Lyadova) and his son Romka (Sergey Pokhodyaev). Kolya was having problems with Mayor Vadim (Roman Madyanov) and his lawyer friend Dimitri (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) traveled from Moscow to help.

Kolyas home was built on property that had been in his family for generations, and the mayor decided that he needed the land for development. He then takes him to court and offers an undervalued sum as compensation. Dimitri arrives from Moscow to help Kolya using his knowledge as a successful lawyer and together they attempt to fight the Mayor in the local court system. However, things start to take a turn for the worse after the court rules in favor of the Mayor. Kolya, a known hothead, goes to the police station with his wife and his friend Dimitri to report the Mayor for an unlawful activity they witnessed. He then loses his temper and yells at the officers and they throw him in jail. Meanwhile, Romka struggles with the events taking place and is still reluctant to accept Lilya because she isn't his biological mother

The use of the camera in the film was wonderful. They were able to capture the beautiful scenery of Russia very well, and appropriately for the direction of the film. One scene that is a good example of this is in the very beginning of the film when they start by showing the ocean working their way to the beaches and town. They were also able to utilize the camera very well to guide us through the film. The way they cut scenes and shifted focus was smooth and guided our focus as well.

The acting in the film was also very good. They displayed a range of emotions that attached us to the characters and made it feel more real. One particular example is when we see Romka and Lilya in the beginning. Romka is reluctant to accept Lilya as his mother and it shows their emotions well. It is taking a toll on both of them and it is wearing down on Lilya while we also see how upset Romka is.

Overall I thought the film was excellent. The acting and film-making are great quality and the story was very intriguing and thought provoking. I highly recommend this to those that enjoy foreign drama films.",1489017600,3,2276,4.598522167487685
6859301,4,B00Q7DWUDY,"Leviathan is an emotional drama movie whose main themes are greed, tragedy, and even deceit, in my opinion.

The movie starts with the main character, Kolya (Aleksei Serebryakov) is an average car mechanic in the town of Pribrezhyny in modern day Russia. The mayor of that town (Roman Madyanov) is corrupt and wants to demolish Kolyas house and use his land to build something, but you're left in the dark about what it is until the end. Because of the mayors influence and power, Kolya meets up with his friend, Dima, who happens to be a lawyer and helps Kolya out with his problem. From then on the story truly unfolds.

The acting and the direction of this movie is phenomenal. The director, Andrey Zvyagintsev, really captured the essence of corruption and greed thats prominent in modern times. Although this film is Russian, a diverse group of people can relate to it, in my opinion. As for the acting, I find that its expressive and full of emotion and I think Zvyagintsev picked the perfect cast for the movie.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie besides the ending, but I suppose that was the point Zvyagintsev wanted to make.",1488931200,,1141,4.723618090452261
6859302,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"Leviathan is a Russian drama. The main characters are Kolya played by Aleksey Serebryakov, Lilya played by Elena Lyadova and their son Romka played by Sergey Pokhodaev. Other notable actors are Roman Madyanov and Vladimir Vdovichenkov. The movie takes place in a coastal town near the Barents Sea.

  The main problem in the story is that the mayor of said town is trying to take Nikolai's land. It is obviously an issue for him because he says that his grandfather and his father had lived on that very land. He says further that he built the house himself so naturally the house will have a great deal of sentimental value for him. Kolya had served in the army in the past and asks an old army comrade, Dima who is now a lawyer, from Moscow to help him out. Unexpectedly, this serves to be a problem for Kolya, but not so much for Lilya. Roma struggles throughout the whole movie. He is a troubled child who suffered throughout his life. He struggles with his dad being an alcoholic while losing his biological mother earlier in life. Dima catches a break when he digs into the corrupt mayor's past. After having his past exposed the mayor becomes extremely paranoid and makes Dima's life miserable.

  The acting in the movie was excellent. You can sympathize with every character in some way whether it be Nikolai finding out his land is being taken away or with Roma when you hear about his past. The acting is so good that you feel yourself loving, hating, and becoming attached to the characters.

  The director picked breathtaking scenes showcasing the beautiful Russian wilderness. One of my favorite scenes from the movie is when Kolya family and friends decide to go to a remote location to grill up some food drink and shoot some targets. This is my favorite scene because the landscape is absolutely stunning from the hills to the view of the ocean.

6859314,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"But should be seen on the big screen to appreciate its epic richness.  I was fortunate in this way, because the imagery is large and deserves a commensurate showcase.  Unlikely that you will see it in a theatre soon, however as the events in the film actually happened in America and were transposed into a story of contemporary Russia.  The U.S. government hated it as did Putin, which, when it comes to their respective handling of questions of justice, makes perfect sense. They have their thugs.  We have ours.  And Zvyagintsev does ask questions about the foundations of justice, in the deepest sense. Is justice, relentless and inexorable, like the ocean pounding the rocky shoreline in the magnificent opening frame of Leviathan, inviolate and coldly pristine, or is it merely a petty, ruthless vehicle for human greed and exploitation?
When it comes to direction, many try, but few have really got it. Zvyagintsev  is a contemporary master.  When I think of the directors that Hollywood is fond of nowadays and compare them to Zvyagintsev, I've got to laugh. First off, Zvyagintsev knows how to move the camera.  There is a scene that follows a fly across a windowpane, shot with such depth, precision, beauty in fact, and pathos, perfectly placed in the film, that is worth the whole catalog of numerous major Hollywood filmmakers.  More importantly, he knows how to move the story - with gravity.  We call that quality discipline.
The level of the acting has been commented on.  Zvyagintsev  has a way with child actors.  Also, I think that had I run into the actor that played the heavy coming out of the theatre, I would have torn him to pieces.  An incredible performance, all the way around.
As I read some of the reviews here, I cannot bring myself to understand how one could not have shed at least an inner tear, if only one, at this testimonial to the current malaise of the human condition.",1458259200,4,1909,4.762917933130699

6859320,3,B00Q7DWUDY,"One of my top 10 favorite movies of all time is My Dinner With Andre.  I point that out just to illustrate that I'm not even close to being a cultural-ADD-riddled American.  95% of all the movies I watch are independent or foreign.  I don't need explosions, car chases, gratuitous sex, or blaring soundtracks to hold my attention or to keep me from looking at my FB account or phone every 5 seconds.

But this movie...Really?  Beyond being just boring, I got irritated by the fact that virtually every scene depicted the characters as drunk.  I mean, if this was a movie about alcohol dependency, fine.  But it got really annoying to listen to the slurred speech in virtually every scene.  Is the film suggesting all Russian people live every moment of their lives while drinking vodka heavily?

The setting/scenery of the movie was breathtaking.  Beautifully shot.  That is the primary reason I gave it 3 stars.

6859355,3,B00Q7DWUDY,"Why does Leviathan violate its alleged realism?

Ponder a car mechanic owning a SUV, a repair garage and a house  several times bigger than the average Russians home.  The film depicts Nikolai as fixing his friends cars for free.  How he had become a successful businessman in his poverty-stricken village?  What had been the source for his income?

Perhaps Nikolai has his own methods of corruption, not explicitly stated in the film.  I could easily believe that in many countries, including America.  But if so, why his wife Lilia has a such stinking (literally) job in the local fish factory?  Lilias fellow worker and girlfriend Angela with her traffic-cop husband Pasha are entirely credible.  Nikolai and Lilia are not.

I really wanted to like this film.  Corrupt politicians, corrupt bureaucrats and corrupt bishops are hugely important facts of life in current Russia.  There is no need to exaggerate.  Unfortunately Leviathan commits several howlers.  (If you dislike plot spoilers, stop reading at this point.)

The real chances of the Russian Orthodox Churchs seizing an individual familys house are probably zero.  If such an scenario were actually to happen, you can be sure that the many critics of the church would rightly and loudly denounce it in Russia.  It has not happened.  The closest events in genuine Russian history have been seizures of Roman Catholic and Protestant church buildings now in the hands of the Russian Church.  Those land-grabs were committed by the Soviet state decades ago; only later the Orthodox bishops became the indirect beneficiaries.  The bishops in those cases should be seen not as thieves but as fences  far from saints but also far from this films depiction.  In the current mood of opinion neither Moscow nor Hollywood wants to highlight western Christian churches as victims.

(To be absolutely precise, there has been at least one post-Soviet case when an Orthodox monastery evicted lay residents from their homes.  Those buildings were on land originally belonged to that monastery before 1917; the church was demanding to recover its own property  -- quite different from fictional Nikolai's ancestral house.)

Important for this film is another piece of Russian history, the 1990s reconstruction of Moscows huge Cathedral of Christ the Saviour  not in any alleged parallels but rather in key dissimilarities.  The Orthodox sought not to steal somebody elses property but to recover their own pre-1917 churches demolished by the Soviet regime.  The hyper-rush, hyper-expensive cathedral project was actually the Moscow mayors brainchild, not the bishops in the 1990s.  The Russian Churchs top leadership behaved in its typical servility to the Soviet and post-Soviet secular state  far from being the dominant partner.  Leviathan reverses reality  depicting the local mayor as the junior partner and the local bishop as the top boss.  In the characters words and body language the film should have given the alpha-male role to the mayor, not to the bishop.

I love the films symbols, both verbal and visual, of a ruthless leviathan partly inspired by the British philosopher Hobbes.  Unfortunately the screenplay depicts a Russian priest mangling the Old Testament.  Nikolai the car mechanic is indeed a Job figure, but an authentic Orthodox priest would never describe Jobs wife as trying to knock sense into her suffering husband.  In the Bible she, not he, was ready to provoke Gods wrath.

Thus this film is seriously flawed.  If you want an honest Russian film about church-state relations, try Tsar (2009)  available via YouTube with English subtitles.  Sadly, both Moscow and Hollywood provide too few fair-minded movies featuring religion.",1438732800,4,3707,5.232993197278912

He makes a living and by doing  odd jobs and fixing his neighbors' cars out of a shed on his property. A property owned by his grandfather and his father before him (a significant fact in Russian culture).  It has become a piece of  prime real estate coveted for development by the village's corrupt mayor.

6859376,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"Given the way Russia appears under the Putin regime, it's amazing that LEVIATHAN got made at all, especially when the producers acknowledged financial support from the government-sponsored Ministry of Culture.  A savage parable of contemporary life, the plot focuses on Kolya (Aleksey Serebryakov) an inhabitant of the wasteland of the north who has lived there for generations in a house built by his forefathers.  His way of life is threatened by corrupt mayor Vadim (Roman Madyanov), who has manipulated the forces of law to buy the land on which Kolya's house has been built, so that he can knock it down and build a church in its place.  Kolya engages the services of hotshot Moscow lawyer Dmitry (Vladimir Vdovichenkov), who takes on Vadim: initially with some success, but finds the task much more difficult as he goes on.

Stylistically speaking, Andrey Zvyagintsev's film has distinct Chekhovian echoes, with Kolya's family and close friends spending a lot of time reminiscing about the past, fueled by vodka.  Contemporary Russia is a changing world in which family ties and loyalties count for nothing: money always talks.  In truth Kolya will always be the little person, perpetually caught up in Vadim's power-schemes.  If Kolya tries to resist too much, he is either thrown in jail or convicted on a trumped-up charge so as to get him out of the way while the family house is demolished.

Roman Madyanov gives a memorable performance as Vadim - a fat, fleshy man reveling in the way he can successfully manipulate the police as well as the church to serve his own ends.  He is virtually untouchable - even when Dmitri confronts him with a long list of misdemeanors, Vadim managed to emerge unscathed with the help of his troupe of bully-boys who follow him wherever he goes in their expensive-looking four-wheel-drive vehicles.

LEVIATHAN is an angry film, no more so than at the end, when Kolya searches for help from the church, but receives only a canting speech in return, telling him to learn the patience of Job so as to cope with his ordeal.  The film ends with a Sunday service, where the local Russian Orthodox Church minister tells his congregation - including Vadim's family - to observe the teachings of Jesus and live a modest life caring for others.  The camera pans the assembled company, all piously listening to the minister's words; and invites us to reflect on their hollowness.  Nothing, it seems, can resist the great god Mammon.",1436054400,2,2464,4.9227053140096615

It is a raw view of people's efforts to work, love and overcome the formal and informal obstacles to living a life.

In Russian with subtitles but still very enjoyable. Based on some friends, it accurately depicts the reality.

6859417,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"A great movie that captures the troubles facing ordinary Russians. It is moving through its acting and storytelling, yet also enlightening. It gives insight into the lives of people living in a very different world.

Several reviewers have commented on the slow pace of the movie. It is certainly slow by Western standards, but as someone who practically grew up on Soviet era films, let me say that it could have been a lot worse. The aesthetics of these filmmakers were very different from the aesthetics of those who make American superhero flicks.",1432598400,,551,4.924731182795699

6859419,1,B00Q7DWUDY,"Oh. My. God. I knew when this opened with a 5-minute shot that c=should have been edited down to 5 seconds, I was going to need matchsticks to prop my eyelids open. I hung in there for another two hours, partly because I thought I'd end up more cultured and partly because I was trying to demonstrate my artful selection of world cinema to my wife, but it just got steadily worse. Very little happens in this two-plus hour snooze fest and what does happen isn't exactly going to brighten your day. I'm sure the art-house folk are eye-rolling me right now but if you expect any type of entertainment or normal enjoyment from a film, this is one to avoid.

The best scene is in the courthouse where a judgment is read very quickly for a full 4 minutes of screentime and the captions try to keep up. In most scenes, peoples are either drinking, getting drunk or already are drunk, while most of the audience wishes they were doing the same. None of the characters are engaging so it's hard to know whether to root for them or forgive Hollywood for the endless parade of superhero films and just hope that Ironman would arrive and give us a finale.

It's just so slow. So, so slow. Criticize American films all you like but at least we have pacing. There's a big whale skeleton in there too - that's the leviathan of the title that has nothing to do with the plot. What a train-wreck of a movie.",1432425600,16,1391,4.366795366795367
6859420,2,B00Q7DWUDY,"This was a very political movie. Forgive me if my critique includes my own political reaction.

I've seen some beautiful Russian cinema and my expectations were high.  Even the old Soviet propaganda movies (e.g. The Battleship Potemkin) are fun to watch..  Leviathan was the inverse of that, not so much a Russian film as an anti-Russian film. Exceedingly bleak, unredemptive. and yes, depressing. The acting was excellent.

The movie was highly political, and its depiction of Russia was so negative, it's hard not to view it in the context of  the non-stop anti-Russian propaganda we get in our own party-controlled media (here in good ol US of A).  We are currently in a second cold war with Russia and back to the specter of nuclear holocaust.  The movie dovetails perfectly into the new status quo, making the point that  current Russia is no different than the old  communist USSR.  There was a scene in which framed black and white pictures of the old USSR party bosses and more recent Russian leaders were all grouped together, just in case anyone wasn't getting the point that nothing has changed.  To me, it seemed strained, disingenuous, and, in terms of propaganda, on par with The Battleship Potemkin.

There was some analogy attempted between the plight of this poor Russian alcoholic and the tribulations of the Old Testament character, Job. It didn't work at all.  There were several CG shots of whales (the Leviathan mentioned in Job)  and an eerie shot of a whale skeleton on the shore.  It was an allusion to something profound that didn't actually exist in the movie.  It would have been a more profound work if a Leviathan (ala Godzilla)  had come out of the sea and eaten Moscow.",1432339200,3,1701,4.810344827586207

6859425,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"much like our own government and minions in local municipalities, this story is one of a family torn asunder to satiate the greed and thirst of those in power who will stop at nothing to get what they covet. call it mafia, the black ops, whatever, there are evil forces at work let loose on unsuspecting families and populous whom consider them/us fodder and livestock. too be round up, corralled, then cut up, cut out, separated, and finally disappeared. like a whisper in the wind, they were never here. no record of their ever been here at all to the root cause of borders without control, men whose might is one dimensional, selfish, maniacal, and self gratifying.

in his 4th film, our director uses the ruin of a family of three to reflect what has become normal SOP for a Russia out of control. what I see is little difference in what they can do, what we do also. only we are better at the cover up, and no mention ever, even in the midst of total naked recognition. a seething and mean film that bespeaks volumes in silence of denials that crosses oceans in an unspoken partnership in that we come get what we want. you never mattered. poof you are a fairy. poof you are gone/invisible. you were always nothing. only nature wicked in all ways, sea, rock, and shore might have a final say. one could hope. brutal and beautiful, sad and honest, brave and cowardly. a magnificent telling from an ever maturing cinematic auteur.",1432080000,,1433,4.554263565891473

The first mistake he makes is underestimating his adversary.  The second is overestimating his allies.  Almost everyone plays a minor part in sending him down the river.  Of course, the small town Russian location will make it a bit more brutal and corrupt than average.  But these types of shenanigans could happen almost anywhere.  It may seem a bit slow paced to some viewers.  But despite taking place over a few days, the dangerous consequences this man faces unfold in a slow and subtle way.",1432080000,7,632,4.580357142857143

6859428,3,B00Q7DWUDY,"Leviathan is set in a small coastal town in Russia. Kolya, his wife Lilya, and their teenage son Roma are plagued by a local corrupt mayor who is trying to take away Kolyas business, house, and land to develop the area. Kolya calls in an old friend, now an Moscow attorney, for help. Together, they fight back, collecting damaging facts on the mayor.

The film, which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, is a study in contrasts. Kolya is a simple man who just wants to remain living in the house he built with his own hands. The mayor is a boorish, power-hungry bureaucrat who cares little for those he believes are beneath him. Every decision he makes is based on how it will benefit him, personally.  Essentially a David vs. Goliath saga, the movie is adept at providing a faceted portrait of Kolya. Hes not a perfect individual, given to rage and too much drinking, but his determination to take a stand against injustice lllustrates both perseverance and nobility.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, Toronto International Film Festival Q & A with director Andrey Zvyagintsev, commentary with the director and producer, and a making-of featurette. The film is in Russian, with English subtitles.",1431907200,4,1236,4.904306220095694
6859429,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"Kolya, an army veteran, has carved for himself, his second wife, and his teenager son from his first marriage, a small fief in far northern Russia. They live in a large, by local standards sumptous house, built by Kolya on the beach. Kolya does well running a car shop, but his wife has nevertheless to work in a boring and demeaning fish processing plant. Kolya's world is shattered gradually by the local mayor, who by terror and strongarming steals Kolya's property. The descent of Kolya into utter misery and virtual hell, without any recourse in the graft cum violence ridden Russia follows an inexorable course of Greek tragedy or Conrad'esque destiny, with Chechov's admixture of angst and truly Russian melancholy and despair. Although many see the movie as a scalding critcism of Putin's Russia, I my opinion it reflects mainly universal human condition. Kolya is a contemporary Job and the mayor, the modern equivalent of Leviathan. There is no recourse to God's cruelty.
Beatifully directed, filmed and set to music with great acting by all, even secondary characters. One definitely can feel the atmosphere, including the permeating fumes of vodka, which is drunk by everybody as if to quench thirst, a variation of Coke it seems.
One jarring note: towards the end of the movie there is a long speech by the Russian Church Bishop, in cahoots with the mayor (also his spiritual leader). The speech tries to put Kolya's fate into the context of the self-evident result of the Church/Crime/Business unholy union. In my opinion, this is an unnecessary political statement.
A really great movie.",1431388800,23,1602,5.026315789473684
6859430,5,B00Q7DWUDY,"Kolya is a simple man making a living by being a small town mechanic on the coast by the Barents Sea. He has a young son, Romka, and a wife who is not the maternal mother to Romka, he also has the house which he has built himself and which stands on a nice part of the coast. This parcel of land is `needed' by the town's Mayor who wants to build some corporate building on it - it has nothing to do with the splendid views or anything like that.

Well Kolya gets an army buddy turned lawyer down from Moscow to try to help. They don't realise that they are a long way from Moscow and even Party connections will not carry that much weight and it soon becomes crystal clear that the Mayor has the whole town in his pocket. What follows is a David and Goliath tale but this one does not have its ending writ in the Bible.

Director Andrey Zvyagintsev has made a film that can take your breath away, seethe with emotion and empathise till your heart aches. This is all wrapped up in stunning cinematography and a story that comes across as both a fable and a modern indictment on all corrupt societies. Its Oscar nomination was well deserved but even without such plaudits this would remain a towering achievement in cinema.",1430524800,28,1222,4.308695652173913
