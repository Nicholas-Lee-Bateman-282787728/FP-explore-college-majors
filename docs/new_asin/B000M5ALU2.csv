8166373,4,B000M5ALU2,Nice reference for those headed to Truk to dive.  A convenient way to show others why you want to go there or even what you saw once you come back.,1377475200,,147,3.9

8166375,5,B000M5ALU2,"The wrecks of Truk Lagoon are a silent testimony to the futility of war.  All of those ships, all of thoses supplies, and most of all the human wreckage.  There is great beauty amidst all this destruction, which shows how these islands have healed themselves.  This battle was a great victory for the us navy, and a shattering defeat for the japanese.  The war rolled on, the islands of Truk were a backwater.  But the hardships of the inhabitants and the japanese troops went for over another year.  But it is nice to witness destruction transformed into beauty. These islands are at peace, as are those who gave their lives for this struggle.  JRV",1366416000,,649,4.640350877192983
8166376,1,B000M5ALU2,"This is an amateur attempt to produce a TV documentary on operation Hailstone and shipwrecks of Truk lagoon. Although the historical reference is fairly well presented, the consultants speak and look horribly boring and disinterested in the subject. The selection of underwater footage shows that the filming team didn't prepare themselves and plan the dives properly, as they didn't show the most interesting subjects at all - probably they were not aware of them!. However, my biggest remark is on all underwater footage which is of totally unacceptable quality for today's standards. It is obvbious that the underwater videographer deosn't have a basic knowledge about underwater filming or any filming, he didn't have a reasonably good wide angle lens, so what you get is a series of shaky, unstable and totally confused and uninteresting underwater videos, after which all you get is a headache.
So these are the reasons why this project failed and I rated it as unacceptable.",1357171200,,981,5.176100628930818
8166377,1,B000M5ALU2,"If you know anything about Truk (Chuuk), or expect some decent dive footage, don't waste your time or money.  This video is poor quality in every way. Don't expect HD since it was completed in 1999 (probaby Hi8), and don't expect very much underwater footage. The audio of the narrator and expert is also lacking in quality.  The graphics used are elementary at best, with some 'scenes' obviously used for filler.  They provide no value except to further diminish the overall quality of this DVD.

Since Amazon does not provide any information on who created this video or what year it was completed, and only provides two sentences to describe the content, I relied on previous reviews in deciding to purchase.  What a mistake.

The video attempts to describe the US task force operations that sunk many Japanese ships in two days, with a small narration on how the attack effected the Lagoon residents.  If you want to learn about what occurred at Truk in 1944, and see decent video of the wrecks, I suggest you pick up Klaus Lindemann's book, ""HailStorm over Truk Lagoon"", start reading, and then go to YouTube and search for dive videos of Truk.  You'll learn more from Klaus, and see better video of the shipwrecks with much of it HD quality.  You will have a much better experience than viewing this DVD.",1357084800,5,1310,4.7105263157894735
8166378,4,B000M5ALU2,"Marvelous stuff.  Great detail.  Would recommend a read prior to diving on
these wrecks to give a diver a better understanding of what they are looking at with each ship.

Thankyou",1256256000,,180,4.741935483870968
8166379,5,B000M5ALU2,Well not really but it gives you a good idea what to expect. Good background info on the battle and wrecks.,1238976000,,107,4.142857142857143
8166380,5,B000M5ALU2,"Since it's so hard to find anything (video) on this subject, it starts earning points junt for being made. On top of that, it turns to be very interesting, complete and fun to watch. I recommend it.",1184112000,3,198,4.378378378378378
