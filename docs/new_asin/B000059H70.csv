1406617,5,B000059H70,"Just got the shipment from Amazon and am listening while writing this review.  It is beautiful!  has all the best songs from Air Supply. Although in term of technology, it can't compare with the lastest and the greatest (Eagles DVD, etc.), hey the songs are great!  It offers both Stereo and Dolby 5.1 and both are up to the job (I like the stereo better).",1016409600,4,356,4.446153846153846
1406618,5,B000059H70,"Great songs, bringing memories to everyone listening. Great band, great sound, old videos but greatly remastered.
I can hardly wait for another Air Supply DVD release. I am a fan and this DVD worths every penny. But I promise that if you are not a fan, you will become one.
So go for it!!",997142400,2,288,4.351851851851852
1406619,4,B000059H70,"It's definitely one of my collectives eventhough not all songs recorded are to my expectation. ""Every Women in the World"" even though live recorded, but the sound quality wasn't very good. However, there are more good ones then just this song,like ""Making Love out of Nothing at all"", ""Young Love"" and ""Here I am"" and also YES ""Sweet Dream"". I rather prefer the music video together with the song re-mastered that those live performance recording. U can see both singers with high quality video and high quality soundtrack and they still look young, I mean I'm geting old too.",991785600,2,576,4.828282828282828
1406620,5,B000059H70,"I absolutely love this DVD, and am so thankful that someone thought enough to put it together.  I cherish it for so many reasons...the interviews with Graham and Russell - two men who have inspired me more than they'll ever know.  After all, they've sung about things I've felt deep in my heart, they've written words I haven't been able to so eloquently speak (Graham Russell, I love you for that), the memories, and the promise of more Air Supply in the future.  I'm delighted that this group has stood the test of time, and that they continue to make music that means so much to so many of us.  Thanks to them for being so generous to their fans over the years, and for not being too discouraged when times got tough.  The video clips of past concerts in this DVD are such a treasure!  It warms my heart to hear the music, it touches my soul to re-live the memories, and has left an everlasting impression in my life!  Thanks Air Supply!",988848000,16,940,4.367816091954023
1406621,5,B000059H70,"I think this is a good DVD, it's really pretty to remember how they see at the begining. This DVD has fifteen songs, some of them in live, only four of them have lyrics, I'd rather like if all of them have lyrics. The interview telling about every song is good in order to understand in their own words how they feel about the music. It's a great DVD.",988675200,4,351,4.101449275362318
1406622,5,B000059H70,"This is a pretty good DVD with all of their greatest hits. You can put the sound to 2 channel stereo or dolby digital 5.1. It sounds much better on 5.1 even if you don't have a 5.1 setup. The videos that I found the most interesting and likeable that are not that boring were 'Even the nights are better' & 'Making Love out of nothing at all'. I also liked the big late 70s disco collar that one of the guys in the band had in the 'Lost In Love' video. There really isn't much for the 'Lost In Love' video just Air Supply singing, not very creative, ah but you just gotta love that disco collar! All in all you will like this DVD for the known bigger hits, the other half of the DVD I really didn't much care. The DVD opens up with Russel and Graham who look pretty aged making an intro to every video before it plays but you can bypass that by pressing the forward button once which takes you to the video. Not that bad.",987897600,,921,4.038251366120218
1406623,5,B000059H70,"This is a wonderful collection of the great Air Supply songs of the 1980's. The description given by Amazon is incorrect in that there are no performances from the Live in Hawaii special. Also Air Supply was wrongly overlooked and not invited to the Arista 25th anniversary special. However, the footage is wonderful. There's a nice mix of videos and live performaces. It's great to have this all in one package and on DVD. The best part was to hear Graham and Russell in the present talk about these old hits and share their thoughts about them. Definitely worth every penny!",986688000,13,576,4.712871287128713

1406681,5,B000059H70,"The dvd is one powerful collection of hits by two men who could sing the high notes better than most.

Relive Air Supply's songs again like: 'Lost in Love', 'All out of Time', 'Keeping the Love Alive', 'One More Chance' and more.

Enjoy fifteen songs of which four are live, and extras that contain an interview with them and lyrics.

It was estastic to see them again performing songs that made people sit up and listen. Although it is still worth having in your collection I gave it four stars as these collections are always too short.",1383868800,,538,4.525773195876289

Just look at the C(see) with your eyeball straight ahead to the television even on the go.

1406719,2,B000059H70,I like Air Supply songs. This DVD is a big disappointment. Sound quality could have been better.,1155859200,,96,4.705882352941177
1406720,4,B000059H70,"Definitely a must have product for a true Air Aupply Fan.  A trip back in time to the late 70's and 80's.  I have to admit, I actually saw them live in concert in the mid 80's while going to college in Providence Rhode Island (hey, I also saw U2).

Now on to the video selections and descriptions.  The Amazon.com review is more accurate - it indicates the DVD has 15 videos and opens with the guys from the band talking about how they met.  This is accurate.  However, the product description names 18 songs - 7 of which are NOT on the DVD I own.  The DVD I own (with a UPC number that matches the Amazon.com listing: 078221469296) has 4 songs that are NOT listed in the Product Decsription.

I purchased my DVD through an Amazon Seller, and everything about the product appears real (it was still factory sealed).

Regardless of the product content error, the collection is still excellent, and the overall quality is very good to excellent as well.

Here are the 15 tracks on the DVD version I own (the ones with an asterisk * are not listed in the product description):

1. Lost in Love

2. All Out of Love

3. Every Woman in the World

4. The One that You Love

5. Here I Am (Just When I Thought I was Over You)

6. Sweet Dreams (Live)

7. Even the Nights are Better

8. Young Love

9. Making Love Out of Nothing at All

10. Just As I Am

11. The Power of Love (You Are My Lady) *

12. Lonely is the Night *

13. Keeping the Love Alive *

14. One More Chance *

15. Now and Forever",1143590400,24,1486,4.094076655052265
1406721,3,B000059H70,"I am surprised to see how much they aged on this DVD.  They look a lot better now in the recent August, 2004 performance at Casino Rama. Russell voice is even stronger and richer comparing to those early years. I am totally impressed. It was a  great concert.

North American fans may not have a chance to listen to 'Keeping The Love Alive' on air . It was a big hit in Asia and they deliver it live on this DVD. Now and Forever are tastefully arranged showing clippings of their past performances and still pictures. Still wish 'Without You' is included in this DVD. All in all, this DVD made you travel back in time to those late 70's early 80's years.",1093996800,3,654,4.300813008130081
1406722,5,B000059H70,"I have always been a fan of Air Supply.  The music soothes something within me and I feel so uplifted every time I listen to their songs.  The songs describe my feelings of love exactly.  I wish I could express to Graham and Russell how wonderful I know their music is.  I grew up listening to them and I will continue to listen to their music.  There just isn't anything bad anyone should be able to say about this group. I love, love, love Air Supply!!",1092441600,3,454,4.232558139534884

Some of the older videos does not have such good quality, but that is probably due to the time when it was recorded. Overall I think this is a good DVD. I'm glad I purchased it.",1075507200,5,310,4.098360655737705

I love this DVD and it really brings back sweet memories!

I am really looking forward to have more Air Supply DVDs in the future.

1406725,3,B000059H70,"When purchasing this dvd i had not heard many Air supply hits, but the dvd is hit and miss... some songs fine and some a bit too old fashioned ...actually i come from England and thought Air supply was American.... just shows how wrong i can be, but i do have a good general knowledge on different types of music...
but if you know Air supply well then i think buying this dvd would be well worth the money...ps my girlfriend sang along to a few songs, so it cannot be too bad",1016668800,,476,4.129032258064516

STYX put out a musical dvd when they performed back to back ""The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight; non stop! To have all their MTV videos would be great too.",1434240000,,381,4.366197183098592
