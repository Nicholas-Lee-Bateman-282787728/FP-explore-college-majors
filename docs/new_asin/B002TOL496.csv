8380388,5,B002TOL496,"A wonderful film with Ida Lupino  portraying a lonely and timid soul. She eventually discovers love,and her performance displays her emotional strength to over come her pitiful circumstances. THe rest of the cast are great, and the photography is first rate. Thank you Amazon for making this film available, and thanks for speedy delivery and safe packaging. I bought this for my self  and On Dangerous  Ground for my husband. Review soon from Coral Vic. Australia.",1515888000,,465,5.092105263157895

8380390,4,B002TOL496,"This is one of my very favorite Ida Lupino films. I think she is as an underated actor and unfortunately forgotten today, remembered more by people for having been a pioneer woman director in the 1950's, but she was just as strong as Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck when it came to her acting talent. Just look at this film or ""The Hard Way"" or ""Roadhouse"" and you will see what an excellent actor she was.",1333670400,6,407,4.368421052631579
