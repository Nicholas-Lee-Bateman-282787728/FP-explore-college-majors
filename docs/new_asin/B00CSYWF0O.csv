Mr. Iturrioz performs several lesser-known Godowsky items, very impressively.  And the story of Godowsky's life is presented in a compelling manner, with lots of rare photos.  This DVD is sure to create more interest in this still relatively unsung pianist and composer.",1488931200,,440,4.75
8585951,5,B00CSYWF0O,"This is a superb view into the life and work of Leopold Godowsky brought to life by the brilliant playing of Antonio Itturioz who produced the film.
I recommend it highly to any pianist and/or music lover who is interested in the history of the piano. Bravo!",1474502400,,258,4.51063829787234
8585952,5,B00CSYWF0O,"I received this DVD as a gift, having never heard of Leopold Godowsky before having met Antonio Iturrioz.  I have studied music for many years, and yet the importance of this man remained to me undiscovered.  Antonio Iturrioz has championed the story of this great pianist, musician, and composer.  What is astoundingly evident from this documentary is Godowsky's genius and intellect.  In his later years, as twentieth century music developed and as the musical tastes evolved, Godowsky's music became out of fashion and fell into relative obscurity.  Thankfully,  Mr. Iturrioz, through this DVD brings his story to us.

Selections of Godowsky's music, known for it's technical difficulty, are played on the DVD by the director Antonio Iturrioz, an internationally acclaimed pianist.  This documentary is enlightening and respectfully represents the work of this great man.",1387843200,,874,5.470149253731344
8585953,5,B00CSYWF0O,"This work is monumental. It not only shows the craft that was refined and celebrated through the genius of Godowsky, But it also allows the viewer to enter into the world of the master himself on a personal level. I have such respect for his music but now even more for how he influenced the lives of others with his gift. This is a remarkable musical documentary/performance that will delight your ears, mind, and imagination of just how you too can impact the world in a great and positive way.

Mr. Iturrioz, a celebrated and internationally acclaimed pianist has directed and produced a DVD which depicts the life of Leopold Godowsky, hailed as the most brilliant pianist, composer and teacher who was influential in the careers of the worlds most famous and adored pianists.  He was known as the pianist for the pianist and many brilliant  famous musical wonders followed him and were privy to his teachings and guidance.

Godowsky's life reads like an inspiration.  An only child of a young widow, he found his way from his grandmother's piano to the musical expression that would result in enormous contributions to the piano literature and exponential influence on so many careers.  He immigrated from Poland to the US and studied here before making his NY debut at age 14.  His career took him across the globe for performances and the DVD will take you from Poland to NY, Berlin ( where his magnificent performance placed him in the pages of history as a piano wonder and marvel), Vienna, England, USA, Asia and more.  He played almost the entire piano literature in his life and produced a huge bounty of compositions, transcriptions and left hand literature in his 68 years.

You will meet composers liker Paderewski, Rachmaninoff, Busoni, Caruso, Hofmann, Gershwin and even Fats Waller and Art Tatum in this DVD.  The story is studded with many musical performances by Mr. Iturrioz ( with his own exquisite tone and brilliance ) and they are beautifully and artfully woven in the story line to the listener's delight.

Mr. Iturrioz celebrates Godowsky and personalizes this idolized genius. We get to know him as a human being as well as a piano super star. The DVD is simply enjoyable and the format is delicious to the eyes and ears with gorgeous music and photography.

I love the DVD and I am a very basic student and pianist and my cousin who has performed internationally and studied at Juilliard and Manhatten School of Music enjoyed it even more.  My friends have thanked me for it.  I am so happy that the Godowsky Society and Mr. Iturrioz have kept this genius alive for all of us to enjoy!",1387584000,2,2253,4.741025641025641
