If you know of Mother Ann and the communities her religion built, this is a beautiful way to view and hear about a religious movement that had profound affects on our nation and a life style of simplisity that we might review for suggestions for the lives we follow today.",1441324800,,363,4.27536231884058

7859845,4,6304048734,"Ken Burns' film about the religious sect ""The Shakers"" is typical of the superior work he has done in making historical documentaries for PBS.  The film is less than an hour in length so of course it is a fairly superficial look at this fascinating group and their contributions to American history. However Burns does delve at least somewhat in to the history and religious beliefs of this group that was originally called the Shaking Quakers and was founded in  18th century England by an illiterate woman known as Mother Ann.  The church grew to have nineteen thriving ""societies"" in the United States that aside from their beautiful simple furniture developed high quality seeds, cattle breeds, brooms, architecture and many other perfectly designed products. As in most Burns documentaries  quotes from journal entries and contemporary writers and observers are read by actors and authentic pictures and photographs are used throughout to illustrate the story.  The most memorable part of the film for me was the interviews with two elderly women who were long time Shakers and who radiated peace and contentment as they told of their long lives in the community.",1209340800,4,1168,5.0942408376963355
7859846,4,6304048734,"Ken Burns brings his inimitable style and ""emotional archaeology"" to one of the most fascinating and least understood religious sect in American history.
I love the images and the sweeping scope of the narration.  But that is where I have to fault the film -- I don't think it goes deep enough.  Some of the most engaging images and topics are treated with only a cursory touch.  I wanted to hear and learn much more.
Unlike Burns' later work, this film actually felt a bit rushed in places.
As a primer on the Shakers, this film is virtually peerless, but I'm afraid it had me asking more questions than it answered.  Still and all, it is beautiful and compelling.

7859847,4,6304048734,"This video was helpful in my studies of the Communial Communities that sprung up around the US in the advent of our country. However, I was unhappy that the director omitted the fact that these communities depict early socialist ideals. It is important in the understanding of where American Socialist movements began or where their inspiration may have come from. I recommend this movie if you are looking for religous movement info or insight on the first  religous ""Great Awakenning"" that took place in the US.",1063756800,7,513,4.965116279069767
7859848,1,6304048734,"Although this video does contain some interesting photos andmusic, it's attributes end there. As a historical work it ismisleading at best by perpetuating uninformed myths andstereotypes.  He does nothing to really explore the foundations ofShaker spirtuality, which gathered thousands to Shaker Villages fromMaine to Kentucky. He neglects to give the viewer a true insight toMother Ann and the Church that she brought to America. But ratherfocuses on the temporal by products of their faith (furniture,architecture, and the like).  Worst of all Mr. Burns leaves theviewer with the incorrect notion that the Shakers are about tovanish. A total misrepresentation of the facts. The community atSabbathday Lake contuines to grow and is excited about thefuture. Even at the time this video was made several new coverts hadrecently joined the community at Sabbathday Lake. It seems odd thatMr. Burns would leave such an important detail out of hisdocumentary. Or maybe editorial is a better word.  The BBC did videoon the Shakers in 1990, 4 years after the Burns video. It is stillavalable, and will give you a much better picture of the Shakers pastand PRESENT.",978912000,21,1157,5.346153846153846
7859849,5,6304048734,"While I was watching this documentary by myself (the fam is more into action packed dramas), my hubby stuck his head in the door, became interested in this video on Shakers and watched most of it with me.
Now  *that's* an endorsement!
It is a very well done piece with some amazing  insights into the day to day life of Shakers, with many interesting tidbits  about their history and American history.
They were an ultra-strict group  and they strove for perfection in everything they did. Some of the tidbits  I enjoyed most - a woman Shaker is credited with inventing the circular saw  and Shakers are also credited with the invention of the clothes pin.
Shakers were devoted, devout, quiet, principled and deeply religious  people. Above all, they were highly disciplined, rising at 4:30 each  morning to begin prayers and chores.
I highly recommend this video - even  if you have only a passing interest in Shakers. It is a compelling  documentary.",960422400,17,952,4.820987654320987
7859850,5,6304048734,"In The Shakers:  Hands to Work, Hearts to God"" Ken Burns truly hit his stride as a documentarian.  By combining personal journals of shakers, historic and social commentary of scholars and contemporaries, and  wonderfully insightful interviews with present day Shakers, Burns tells a  simple story, but tells it beautifully.  By illustrating the Shaker life  and ideology, Burns presents a group of dedicated people who strove to put  God into every aspect of their lives.
If you know the Shakers for only  their furniture and ritual dancing, then this film will illuminate your  understanding of early America's most powerful Utopian movement.",958867200,15,644,5.36
