8326097,5,B0014K49NE,"This DVD has two short featurettes on the Greater Rochester area in 1963. In part, the featurettes were made to celebrate the opening of the now-defunct Midtown Plaza, which was a downtown fixture for 45 years (until it was closed and condemned earlier this year [2008]). As I am a native of the Rochester area, I enjoyed revisiting the time when I first was able to explore downtown Rochester on my own, and was glad to see ""The Clock of the Nations"" again, if only on video.

If you grew up in the Rochester area in the 60's, I highly recommend this DVD.",1207699200,,556,4.398058252427185
