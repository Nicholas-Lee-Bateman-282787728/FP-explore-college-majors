6506851,2,B00LU7K55M,"From the cast and crew that brought you Bad Teacher, comes Sex Tape, and on the surface it had all the makings of the next big comedic hit. Many people were saying that Sex Tape could be the next Hangover, as it is an original idea with an all-star cast, but sadly it falls well short of expectations. Annie & Jay's marriage has become a little stale, so one night they decide to spice things up by making a Sex Tape. Jay is a music producers and inexplicably neglects the fact that his laptop is connected to many other devices, and the tape finds its way to the cloud. Once again, Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz have absolutely no chemistry. They are too different types of actors that just don't compliment each other and they are even less believable as a married couple. If that were the only issue with this film, maybe I could have gotten passed it, but the real problem, as with Bad Teacher, is that the writers don't know their audience. This is an R rated film about a sex tape and in no way meant for children, yet the jokes are on a sixth grade level. As an adult going to see a raunchy comedy, I'm not interested in jokes about erections and diarrhea, it's in very poor taste and isn't something many adults will respond to. This film is supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy, but there was barely even a snicker in the movie theater, which basically tells you all you need to know about this film. Sex Tape is trying to get people to see it under the guise of being raunchy and featuring some pretty attractive stars, that fans hope they will get to see naked. The truth is that it is very amateurish, you really don't see all that much, and the jokes could be out of PG movie. All in all, Sex Tape is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time.",1405900800,4,1761,4.244047619047619

Too bad critics did not see the brilliance in the story and humor.

Everyone in the theatre was howling.
So how could the critics not like it is beyond my understanding.
I will predict this movie will thrive when the video is released.",1405814400,,408,4.76056338028169

_______________________________________________________

When the internet couldn't be any more dangerous we get Sex Tape, directed by Jake Kasdan, a comedy about a couple who unwittingly release a sex video for all to see. The movie stars, Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as Jay and Annie who try to ignite their love for one another by the very thing that started it all, sex, sex, and more sex. After years of marriage, caring for two kids, and a busy work schedule, they decide to spruce things up and record themselves having sex. But with Jay unclear about the cloud, the video goes viral and both Jay and Annie must race to delete the video before its too late.

The trailer for Sex Tape didn't come off as a movie that could be taken seriously. The premise is simple and everything there after was fluff. If youve seen the trailer then you basically saw the movie with little to no surprises. It was disappointing to watch cause the movie was spoiled from the trailers and with every scene you can see coming. On top of that a lot of the laughs were not even all that funny; rather they fell flat and were poorly written into the script.

When it comes to the acting, the chemistry between Diaz and Segels characters were a bit odd; almost teenage like? A rather lengthy prologue that shows how Annie and Jay came to be was tasteless and childish. The setup is ridiculous as it only tries to be dirty and cheap. They didn't really seem comfortable in their roles and had opposite personalities that didn't match. A lot of the blame is in the script and how poorly it was done. Actor Rob Lowe, as Hank, was an oddball character; especially his interaction with Annie when she and Jay went over to his house.

There were just a lot of things the audience had to accept; for instance, Jay and Annie offering friends, family, and clientele all Ipads. Or how Jay has a computer and other technologies and he doesnt know how to upload or take down videos? The writers tried really hard to make the case for the sex tape to get loose and be the main driver of the movie. If you plan on watching a comedy this weekend, go see Chef (click here for review) cause Sex Tape will leave you in tears; and I don't mean that in joy.",1405641600,2,2290,4.471291866028708
6506855,3,B00LU7K55M,"The last time we saw Cameron Diaz (ignoring The Other Woman because it's terrible) she was straddling a car while Javier Bardem watched in awe/horror in The Counselor. She's shaken her butt in two Charlie's Angels movies and used male body fluids for hair gel. Basically, raunch is not something she's afraid of in the least, but what will surprise those expecting her new comedy Sex Tape to be full of it, they'll find it's more sweet than salacious yet still very funny.

Reuniting with Bad Teacher director Jake Kasdan and co-star Jason Segel, Diaz is the star of this show because, like in the world of adult entertainment, nobody cares about the dudes. She plays Annie, a married mother of two who is trying desperately to figure out where the passion in her marriage has gone. Recounting her sexual history with husband Jay, they started off hot and heavy in college, thinking they'd retain that physical desire through pregnancy and marriage. The flashbacks, which feature Diaz and Segel distractingly aged down, are hilarious for the novelty and frequency of their characters' sexual acts. But years later the romance is gone and they can barely remember what sex is supposed to be like.

She's a blogger who writes about motherhood while he has a nebulous job at a radio station, and their seemingly disparate careers collide in ways neither could predict. When a major corporation agrees to buy Annie's blog to turn into a wholesome family destination, it's a cause for celebration. Sending the kids away for the night, she dresses up like Roller Girl from Boogie Nights and engages in an epic 3-hour (""That's the length of the movie Lincoln! You did the full Lincoln!"") sex romp with Jay in which they do every position in Joy of Sex. And as part of this renewed coital vigor, aided by a healthy dose of tequila, she also suggests videotaping the night. She demands he erase the footage afterwards, but of course he forgets and this is where his job screws things up even further. Jay has these amazing playlists stored on his IPad and is constantly getting new ones and giving away the old IPads as gifts so others can have the same music. But what he didn't realize is their sex tape would also be synced and sent out to all of the old IPads he gave away. Of course this is stupidly far-fetched but Jay is just enough of a moron that we can accept it and the wild goose chase that follows.

For a couple of reasons Sex Tape reminded me of the first couple of National Lampoon's Vacation flicks. Jay's forgetting to erase the tape was a call back to Clark Griswold's doing the same to his wife, and her image ended up plastered all over Europe as a result. Their increasingly zany journey to collect every single IPad ever given away is one that we know is doomed for failure and significant amounts of property damage. Accompanied by their horny best friends (Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper), Annie and Jay's weirdest stop involves a run-in with the publishing guru who wants to buy her blog. Turns out he's not so wholesome (his collection of Disney-themed art is creepy as Hell) as his public persona would suggest, and as played by Rob Lowe it's probably the most inspired sequence with drugs, rabid attack dogs, and more. It's basically the centerpiece scene and the script by Segel, Nicholas Stoller, and Kate Angelo jams a lot of craziness into it. Pacing becomes an issue as a result, with the energy dipping substantially as a crop of useless subplots emerge to pad out a thin narrative. We get the central message within the first five minutes; marriage is tough and maintaining passion is even tougher, and it would be great if the issue was tackled with more of an edge. Yes, there are glimpses of nudity and kinky sexual acts in the beginning but once that's over the film is fairly inoffensive. Fortunately, Diaz is versatile enough to shine no matter what, and she's really been hitting her stride as of late. Segel, looking gaunt now that he's gotten into shape, doesn't get as many laugh lines as Diaz but he's got impeccable chemistry with her that elevates the humor a great a deal.

Sex Tape has plenty of laughs but is less like a racy secret rendezvous than an enjoyable date night at the movies.",1405641600,,4228,4.6559571619812585

Thankfully somewhere around the middle of the movie the couple make their way to the home of the wife's new boss played by Rob Lowe.  This was the saving grace of the movie, as Rob Lowes character was insanely funny!  A straight laced looking fellow with a freaky wild side when his family was out of town.  While Cameron Diaz's character partied with her boss, her hubby was being chased by a killer German Sheperd throughout the house, and that was also hilarious!

6506953,5,B00LU7K55M,"We got this movie courtesy of a free week or so of Starz and while we had been anticipating this comedy, we began to get a little wary of it after finding mainly one star reviews. Thankfully my husband and I are ones that enjoy making up our own minds and forming our own opinions on things, especially movies.

Before I go any further let me warn you that there are graphic scene's and that the content is not suitable for younger viewers. Something, that given the title of the movie you would think would be a given but you never know these days.

Anyway, the movie starts out with a mommy blogger sitting on her couch talking about the time at the beginning of her relationship with her husband and all the erections and sex they had. She talks about how that can disappear under the strains of marriage and children.

The best part of this movie is that it is believable, Jason Segal and Cameron Diaz have such great chemistry that it is extremely believable that they were married. The couple had a quirky sarcastic banter that reminded me a lot of mine with my husband.  Perhaps that was why I enjoyed the movie so much.

I loved that it felt so realistic.

I can easily see someone making a Sex Tape as a way to put some more oomph in a long married relationship, accidentally forgetting it and it getting leaked out.

This is seriously a movie I would add to my own collection and watch over again.",1451692800,,1407,4.367816091954023

6507004,2,B00LU7K55M,"Jay and Annie are a married couple with two small children who decide to make a three-hour sex tape of themselves trying all of the positions in ""The Joy of Sex"" and, instead of deleting it, they accidentally forward the video to everyone they know.

A lot of funny scenes could have come from this idea, but whoever wrote this movie didn't know what to do with it.

The only funny part of the entire movie was the scene with Rob Lowe and his paintings.  The scene could have been funnier if they left out the cocaine, which was pointless.

There was a scene with Rob Lowe's dog which was horrible, where Jay is running from the dog and almost kills the dog.  Not funny.  The dog attacks him, and Jay leaves Rob Lowe's house covered in blood and limping.  Later in the movie, Jay jumps from a balcony and breaks one arm and one leg.  Not funny.  Annie never seems concerned over Jay's injuries and treats her husband like a moronic nuisance.

Jay and Annie's married friends ""skim"" over the video and become turned on by it, and they then have sex in their car.  Not funny.

A 12 year old boy, who is a friend of Jay's son, sees the tape.  He blackmails Jay, and they argue back and forth, with a lot of cursing and threats.  This was a horrible and unnecessary scene between a child and a stupid adult.

There is a lot of cursing.  There is a lot of nudity, but nothing at all erotic or romantic.  The sex looks awkward and tries to be funny.

The movie ends with the message that a couple should remember ""why they started F*%$#ing each other in the first place.""
In other words, this couple have been married for a long time, and they have lost the romance and kindness and attraction and ""urgency"" toward each other that they had before they got married, which is really sad.",1436313600,,1779,4.33939393939394

After having two children and have less opportunities to make love,they decided to re-ignite their sex life. Amidst their difficulties especially Jay who is having difficulty to have an erection by making a sex tape. They try to do every sexual position known to man and have their video entitled,The Joys Of Sex. Later,they get to realize that their sex tape have been spread online after Jay made a computer error. The couple do some actions to prevent its further spread and remove its existence online.

This film stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel together with Rob Corddry, Ellie Kemper, and Rob Lowe. Too bad that despite of the talented cast involved,the film was simply boring and corny. Despite having sex,crudeness,profanity and vulgarity involved in the humor of the film and comedic scenes,it fails to provide fun and manages to elicit only a few scenes of laughter. The plot definitely misfires as it tries to provide all the necessary sexual positions that Jay and Annie perform which I felt was far from being funny as well considering that Diaz and Segel are obviously uncomfortable doing their scenes which only made it less realistic and unintentionally unfunny and ineffective as comedic scenes.

Like there is no clear path to where the movie was going and the supporting cast could have well been extras for the type of roles they were given. To me, it fell short. Cameron just wanted to prove she had a banging body (but even that was more well portrayed in the Other Woman- which is pretty good) and Jason just wanted to prove he can act on the big screen and hold his own next to a huge celebrity ( which like Cameron, he did better in another movie- Forgetting Sarah Marshall). It's a filler movie for both the actors and the studios and for that, it only got three stars from me. Happy Watching!",1430179200,,1194,4.1731601731601735
6507041,2,B00LU7K55M,"The basic story is this: A man and a woman date each other for years, and have LOTS of sex together. They get married, and then they have less sex. To spice things up, they decide to make a porno. The husband promises to delete the porno, but he unwittingly uploads it on his iPad (which makes the video visible to anyone with an iPad). The movie goes on from there.

This movie is a mixed bag. On one hand, the movie was entertaining. I don't why it's watchable, but it is. The acting is also quite good, and there's some nice laughs.

However, that's just the problem: laughs. Considering that this movie is a comedy, it should be funnier than it is. There's too few laughs considering that the film is 94 minutes long. Perhaps a one-time watcher, but that's it. Definitely not a keeper.",1429920000,,789,4.397260273972603

6507056,1,B00LU7K55M,"S.Tape may have been clever back when Ipads first arrived, but not now. As others remarked, the chemistry is so off and uncomfortable to watch. Segal looks like a meth addict with rings under his eyes. I'm sure this wasn't what Diaz expected when he showed up to set. The dude looks like a ghost. He appears to have starved himself and could faint at any moment. Segal also made a derogatory comment about their son in the movie which I thought was crude. I already disliked his actions and now he's calling his son a cuss word behind his back and we're supposed to find it humorous. It appears the director told the actors to act like they're on speed and they'll only be getting one take per scene. A desperate movie that wouldn't be funny in an SNL skit even. Film roles must be drying up in Hollywood. I also don't think it would be that big of a deal if a buddy of mine got a hold of a tape of me. I see him joking for maybe two minutes before giving back. He probably wouldn't want to see it anyway. People are more mature than these two idiots in the movie.",1428451200,,1064,4.195121951219512

it had a few funny parts. the part where the husband is being chased by a German shepherd while the wife was snorting coke was moderately humorous.

showtime promised nudity and ""strong sexual content"". there was some nudity and some sexual content but not as much as the hype might have you believe.

if you like this kind of mindless and plot less movie you may appreciate it more than I did.

6507095,1,B00LU7K55M,"This is the first - the FIRST - time that I've actually wanted to give zero stars to a movie. I've seen lots of people say that in other reviews, and I've always thought, ""Nah - there were a few funny bits that rate at least 1 star."" Not this time.

**Spoilers**

Let me put it bluntly - exposing a child to profanity and pornography is not funny. EVER. Having an adult actor SWEAR at a 13/14 year-old child who SWEARS back, while discussing a SEX TAPE, is WILDLY inappropriate. I'm not uptight, nor am I easily shocked - but every scene with Harrison Holzer turned my stomach.

I'm also completely MORTIFIED that I rented this from my public library. Obviously I thought it would be a raunchy-sort of comedy, like Cameron Diaz movies tend to be, but nothing I'd be embarrassed to admit I watched. The last one of her movies that I saw (The Other Woman) had me howling with laughter. So I thought this movie would be funny BECAUSE a sex tape got accidently sent out - NOT an ACTUAL sex tape movie! This was essentially soft-core porn! It was nothing more than 90 minutes of constant profanity + half naked people humping each other. It was just completely gross.

If this was supposed to be a comedy then I just didn't get it. I couldn't even laugh at the Siri line - I was too busy cringing at the slow-motion shot of a beautiful dog being slammed into a wall. Sorry, but after all the swearing, porn, horrible drug scene, boring dialogue, and ridiculous plot - I guess I just wasn't in the mood to laugh at animal abuse either.

I'm also seriously annoyed that I just watched a 90-minute Apple infomercial. Apparently Apple thinks I'm too stupid to notice the CONSTANT gushing about all the *great* features the new iPad has (like the ""high res camera""). Ugh. My only vindication is knowing I've never spent a penny on any of their products, and any desire I ever had for an iPhone is now completely GONE.

I'm going to have to put this thing in the late-night drop box at the library when no-one can see me returning it. Good God - hopefully the very sweet volunteer librarian - who is older than my GRANDMOTHER - didn't realize what she was scanning when I checked it out.  Just having this thing out in my name makes me feel dirty - and I mean that literally, not in a *wink-wink* sort of way. I'm not sure what's more shocking - this disgusting movie or the fact that my local library had it!

That sounds like a great comedy premise.  However, after about 5 minutes in, I realized I had made a mistake.  The movie is chock full of cursing, to the point of it being unnecessary, and I never thought I would see Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel's full nude backside and Cameron's nude side chest region (you know what I am talking about) which was... interesting?  Now, I am not a prude, and I know people curse in movies, but when literally every few sentences contains the ""F"" word, enough is enough.  Aside from that, the movie, itself just isn't funny.  Like, at all.  There were maybe 2 times in which I laughed, but it was more of a nervous laughter and sort of a ""oh my god! what just happened?!"" type of reaction.  Case an point?  Jason smacks a dog over the head with a book and it becomes unconscious.  Now, that is not to say the movie didn't try, there were plenty of instances in which I knew the writers were expecting me to laugh, but it just wasn't there.  Like out of no where, Cameron and her boss are together and start talking about doing Cocaine while Jason's character is running around her boss' house being attacked by a dog... Okay...?  The writing of the movie is also horrible, I knew I was watching a movie the entire time and everything sounded forced and punched out.  Not believable at all. And the fact that their video is in the hands of their best friend's, like, 15 year old child who tries blackmailing them for $25,000?  Not buying it.

6507269,3,B00LU7K55M,"This movie takes about half an hour to get to what we know it's about, a couple make a sex tape and upload it onto their friend's, potential employer and mailman's tablets by mistake then try and get to those devices before those people view them.  That first half hour is just boring as, I considered stopping the movie a few times but thought gees it's got to get better than this.  The two aging actors also have a flash back scene to when they were teenagers and first hooked up both are too old to pull that off, they should have got younger actors who looked like them.

When the actual pursuit to delete the video part of the film kicks in, the movie never reaches great heights but does get a lot better, albeit the two characters complicate their situation by ignoring the obvious solution (as pointed out by a child character). Spoilers follow - and even if they didn't realise they could do that, simply explaining the situation to the job interviewer for example, ""look my idiot husband here may have uploaded something stupid and embarrassing on that Ipad I gave you, do you mind if he just deletes it"" would have worked rather than pretending the car broke down and ""oh hey is this your house, can he use your bathroom.""  The dog scenes with Segel were the highlight of the film, although in reality the dog would have got him in seconds.  Ridiculously long Jack Black rant got old after a few lines and what are the odds the server would be in the exact city they live in and not India or Russia or something?  Again you'd think you'd just phone the place and ask them (or offer money) to take it down.

I'd rate this overall two and half stars, one for the slow boring first half hour, four for the implausible but amusing at times rest.",1419897600,,1753,4.3919753086419755

The first hour was a depressing, deconstruction of marriage that went 59 minutes too long, the one slightly wacky scene with Rob Lowe had promise, and then ended with a strange anti-climax (pun) at a school benefit which occurs after the supposed ending (a weird break-in scene and strangely accented Jack Black). All told, this was a poorly-edited and scripted, muddled, depressing, off-rhythm movie that never found its footing. Cameron Diaz tried *really* hard, but a gaunt Jason Segal seemed to be brow-furrowed and laconic from start to finish and not willing to play ball.

However, the direction, production (choppily transitioning between performers, weird angles and perspectives) music, sound (like it was an inexpensive after thought) and dialogue left much to be desired. I wanted to push through watching it, which I did, because I kept thinking it would smooth out. It didn't and was like being hungry and anticipating someone making you a wonderful peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a cold glass of creamy milk. Instead you get a trip to the kitchen wondering where it all is and see your three year old finishing up by slapping the peanut butter half against the glass and the jelly half jellied on both sides.

6507484,2,B00LU7K55M,"Let's start by saying this up front. The idea of a sex tape may have been controversial about 10 years ago but with the number of celebrities who have had them mysteriously released and talk on daytime talk shows about people doing this to spice up their marriages it's an old topic now. I guess the makers of this film thought it was a funny idea when they started but the movie they've delivered leaves much to be desired.

Cameron Diaz plays Annie and Jason Segel plays Jay, a couple which met years ago and fell hopelessly in lust. Yes it seems that when they met in college years ago the attraction was more about how many times and places they could have sex than anything deeper. The progress to the point where they decide to get married, have kids and then suddenly things change. Reality sets in. Instead of making whoopee all the time they now have to do things like work, get the kids places they need to go, feed the kids, spend time with the kids...you know, real life stuff. With all of this going on they have no time left for one another and when they find time they're both too exhausted to do anything.

One night when they do have some time alone Annie suggests to Jay that they make a sex tape, one of the things they've heard so much about. Their plan is to do as many positions from their old JOY OF SEX book which they will film with their iPad. When done, they'll have a laugh and delete the whole thing. Of course since we know the title of the movie we know that this won't be what happens. Jay routinely gets iPads and when the new one comes in he gives the old one to someone else like his in-laws or kids or friends. Since he mixes music he leaves on a syncing program to each one that downloads everything he leaves on his iPad so they can get updated music mixes he does. Unfortunately he keeps the sex tape for himself forgetting all about this.

Suddenly the pair are running around like mad in an attempt to locate every single iPad that Jay has handed out starting with their kids, moving on the his in-laws and then to their friends. One of the big ones though is getting it back from a possible employer Annie gave one to with her video resume on it. As played by Rob Lowe he does his best with the part given to him but his recent DirecTV commercials are much funnier.

This isn't to say that there aren't occasional funny moments in this movie. The problem is when you try to go back and remember what they are the chances of coming up with one are slim. No one involved here feels like this was a movie that they just couldn't wait to be in. They bring little life to the movie which results in your just not caring enough what happens to them. Diaz gives it the old college try but she's done so many roles like this they've all begun to blend into one another. Segel has done much better than this and here just seems to be walking from one soundstage to the next with no enthusiasm.

I guess if there is nothing much else to watch on TV or on cable or at your choice of rental locations this might be one to pick up. It can't hurt (but definitely not for children as if that needs said) but it's not a film I would say you want to rush out to rent let alone buy. As I think back I'm not sure I'd even pick this one up once it hits the discount racks at Walmart. Even $5 seems too much to pay for this one.",1417564800,2,3349,4.162037037037037

The F bomb is pervasive throughout the movie, and is what they, as a married couple refer to the act as also.

Yet another comedy that really has a plot and forgets to be funny. I think this is one of those movies that really aims for a certain demographic (couples 20-40 possibly with children) and hopes to cash in.

6507670,4,B00LU7K55M,"While ""Sex Tape"" tends to be uneven as many such, ""guy-oriented"" sex comedies are these days (think of Seth Rogen's ""Neighbors""), it does, like the best of that lot, pull itself above the sophomoric humor -- before, during and after -- long enough to show both heart and true wit in the writing and acting.

Jason Segel -- who co-wrote -- is definitely one of the better actors of his generation, with just the right amount of goofiness and gravitas.  And Cameron Dias has more than lived up to promise she showed way back when in ""The Mask"", with great acting roles in drama (""Gangs of New York"") and thrillers (""Knight and Day"") and, most of all comedies.  HER ability to go from full-on dramatic to full-out goofy is always enjoyable (there are a few actresses, who shall remain unnamed, who CAN'T navigate comedic waters to save their lives).  She always gives off the brainy but fun vibe, in her acting roles.

This one's a fun, no-brainer, with a big heart -- and one that can be enjoyed by couples, married or not

There were none of the usual ""negative"" characters in these types of movies (e.g., the idiot husband, the b***h wife, the mean friends, etc.)  It was pleasant to watch.

One thing that did bother me though was the age disparity.  The couple marry ""too young"" after getting pregnant in college.  So why is their son 9/10 year old, and they're close to 40?  If they married at 20, they should be 30.  Why even bother with the college story?  Why not just have them marry in their late 20s so the ages would make sense.

We were soo very wrong,  NOT THE CASE AT ALL!!! It had an actually decent story line, which as I said above, that was just ""light"" & easy to watch,  nothing very ""deep"" at all. We were sooo very wrong with ALL of our preconceptions of this movie & actually laughed aloud through the majority of it. It had a decent story line involving friendships & family,  etc, which I think many people go thru at one time or another in their own relationships & glad they included that in the film. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND (already have to family & friends) WATCHING,  NOT a waste of time & you will really enjoy if you're looking to watch a funny or ""light"" film instead of many movies that you may have heard were great but are quite long with ""deep"" story lines that make u really have to pay close attention to every single word or u may miss something. .I know for myself,  I have to be in a certain mood to watch that type of film & this past wkend was just looking for something to give a few laughs & not have to really think much & we got much more than had ever expected!! We both laughed throughout but also spoke about the few more ""serious"" scenes, that were meaningful to the entire film, afterwards.
Overall a  ""2 thumbs up"" movie for me & also my husband(who is a tough movie critic!!). Worth the Watch!!",1415145600,3,1638,4.3019480519480515

The one thing that did grow tedious was the ridiculous overuse of straight intercourse. Here's a couple supposedly trying to spice up their sex life and this is all they can come up with? And the ""jumping on him"" was just stupid. It would have broken him and damaged her. Stupid. But...the actors are so on their games, including all the supporting actors and extras that it more than makes up for it and for a comedy moves it for me into 5 stars.

It's good in theory but I feel that everything else in the story was just a lame idea.  Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz's acting are just very poor performances in this movie.  They try to make it believable but they just failed miserably.

The scene with the dog in it where they were in Diaz's boss's house and she was distracting him so her hubby could look for the ipad was just too long and drawn out.  And the one funny joke in that scene where he asks Siri how to perform CPR on a dog was in every single preview/commercial for this movie ever, so when I finally saw it on the big screen, it wasn't funny anymore.

People trying to fix something and everything being much much harder then it has to be. The two Segel and Diaz have great chemistry and watching them interact is hilarious.

6508000,4,B00LU7K55M,"Once in a while a film comes around that sets its sights on exploring something fundamental to human existence at one pivotal moment. A film that presents a cautionary tale that shakes the philosophical core of a generation. A film that whole-heartedly immerses itself in the journey to discover the answer to a ponderous question that plagues each and every one of us, especially in this digital age. The question: What happens if my sex tape is accidentally uploaded to the public?

Thankfully, director Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher, Orange County) has taken the challenge of answering this question with his new film, Sex Tape. Sex Tape finds married couple Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) in the clichd marital funk that inevitably and cinematically arrives when kids are introduced into the relationship. Once erotically charged, Jay and Annies marriage has displaced its sexual component so much that they apparently don't even know how to do it anymore! Naturally, the next logical step to rekindle that spark is to send the kids to grandmas, dust off that copy of The Joy of Sex, set up the iPad, and record what happens. All is right with the world until the mysterious Cloud uploads Jay and Annies sex tape to all of Jays devices including the ones gifted to their best friends Robby and Tess (Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper), Annies hopeful new employer Hank (Rob Lowe), and even the mailman. Now, with the clock ticking on the decimation of their reputations, Jay and Annie begin a city-wide quest to recover the iPads before their tape is viewed and their lives are screwed.

Now if you cant tell from the tone of this review, the worst thing you can do with Sex Tape is take it too seriously. The set up to the film is breezy and enjoyable, as is the films second act where Jay and Annie recruit Robby and Tess to help them. The film does hit some snags in the third act where the ridiculousness quotient is pushed to the limits and the movie loses some of its zeal. Also unfortunate is that Sex Tape now joins the crowded subsection of films that include a snooping character who is suddenly pursued by the homeowners dog, culminating in a fall out of a second story window.

These faults aside, Sex Tape has some good laughs and Diaz and Segel commit, no doubt about that! Also, Lowe, Corddry and Kemper are always fun to see and are welcome inclusions to this cast. On the most part, Sex Tape is funny, but for a supposedly adult comedy about a very adult subject, it feels more childish and goofy than it ought to, especially that third act (perhaps a result of being written by two of the writers of The Muppets). Nonetheless, Sex Tape has its heart, among other body parts, in the right place. B

6508004,3,B00LU7K55M,"Okay.... This will be a PG-13 review about an R-rated movie. Rest assured, this is every bit as raunchy as the title would imply as we watch a happily married couple discover that the personal sex tape they made the evening before might go viral. (Their sex life has become humdrum, so they try all the variations in the book, ""The Joy of Sex."")

The first part of the film shows us the lusty beginnings for this couple, directed with a fairly heavy hand by Jake Kasden (""Bad Teacher""). Their early life together is lots of fun and establishes their characters. We always want some to root for and this is a very likable couple. I found the double takes and reaction shots a bit overdone, although the actors gave this project everything (and I mean EVERYthing) they had.

Here is part of the cast:
  * Cameron Diaz (""The Other Woman"") Annie is a generous, loving (and very flexible!) woman who adores her family. She may have a buyer for her blog, which would set her up with a welcome income. This actress will cherish this film long after her shelf life expires; she looks terrific!
  * Jason Segel (""This is 40"") Jay is successful, stable and a bit over- domesticated. When he discovers that their home-made tape may be in ""The Cloud"" he has to admit not only does he not under- stand it, NO ONE understands it! BTW, I have never seen this guy look so appealing.
  * Rob Lowe (""Parks and Recreation"") Hank is a charming businessman interested in expanding Annie's readership for his wholesome, family-oriented publication (but check out what he has in his bedside table).
  * Rob Corddry (""In a World"") Robby may be a good friend, but he and his wife Tess (Ellie Kemper) would really like a peek at that video.

Expect lots (and LOTS) of nudity, profanity, drug use, and simulated sex. To my relief, I saw no gunshots, no vehicular mayhem and no blowie uppie stuff, but there is a ferocious dog. I laughed out loud many times but it would have been even funnier if the mugging had been toned down a bit.

The actors have to have good chemistry and play off one another well, the writing has to be quick, witty and not stupid. The timing has to be right, and the players must have the capacity to be genuinely funny. When something is off, the whole thing is off.

""Sex Tape"" sounds like something that shouldnt even be playing in an American multiplex - it aspires to be a modern Hollywood filthy movie - a ""sex comedy."" This kind of comedy hasn't worked in many years. For every ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Knocked Up,"" theres ten ""Gigli""s. ""Sex Tape"" falls somewhere in between the two.

Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) are a couple that used to have an animalistic attraction to one another in college, but two kids and fifteen years or so of marriage later, they are more like roommates than spouses. In an attempt to get some of the sizzle back to her marriage, Annie suggests that the two film themselves having sex - what could possibly go wrong?

In this day and age, the way something can circulate on the internet is a truly terrifying thing. Their home movie goes into the cloud, which leads to a frantic effort to try to get the thing erased and save their reputations.

Diaz and Segel play off each other quite well, and the jokes are sometimes quite funny. But its never original, and infrequently memorable. The film boasts quite a few belly laughs that aren't even shown in the trailers. Its also never gratuitous or tasteless in the sexy moments. At the heart, its about a couple that is trying their best to keep their romance alive. Its really more sweet than salty, for better and for worse.

Theres nothing truly bad about Sex Tape, and leaves the viewer in a warm-fuzzy place. Its just never as good as it could have been.

At this point she comes up with a clever line that integrates her relationship and the film.  Instead the writers dropped the ball, as I felt they did the entire film.

The story is a simple one: with a view to reigniting the spark in their relationship, a married couple make a loving private video. They lose it in the internet cloud, then they try to recover it and stop it being seen by the world.

That premise gets the story going, and the humor stems from their efforts to regain their privacy.

6508010,1,B00LU7K55M,"Sex Tape, the new film from the people who brought us Bad Teacher (which should have been my first clue this firm would suck), is a film that squanders a pretty good premise due to poor execution. Worse, with two pretty obvious changes, the film could have been so much better.

Annie (Cameron Diaz), a mother of two, writes a daily blog about parenting that is drawing the interest of a super-conservative toy and baby product company - they want to buy the blog, to help reach more of their customers. Jay (Jason Segel) is a producer at a local music station who uses a lot of iPads to store and come up with the playlists - when he gets a new iPad, he gives the old ones away. Because Jay and Annie are so busy and the kids take up so much of their time, they feel it necessary to schedule when they are going to have sex. But to celebrate the potential sale of her blog, Annie takes matters into her own hands. When Jay arrives home, Annie appears, wearing very little and the message is clear. After some aborted starts, they decide to make a sex tape of them performing every position in The Joy of Sex (I know, not exactly a modern idea). Cut to the end of the marathon session and Annie sleepily asking Jay to remember to erase the sex tape. The next day, Jay gets a phone text complimenting him on the video. Uh - oh. Not only did he not remember to erase the video, it has been synced to all of those iPads he gave away to friends, family members, the postman, Annies potential new boss (a very creepy Rob Lowe, but maybe thats redundant). They have to get all of the iPads back and erase the video, to save their embarrassed egos.

Directed by Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher, Zero Effect, Walk Hard) and written by Kate Angelo (The Back-Up Plan) and Jason Segel, the films amusing beginning is quickly squandered when the story becomes weird and unfunny during the interminably long middle act before a slightly funny end tries to redeem all of the mess we were just forced to sit through.

Before we go any further, let me address something about this film. There are two words used repeatedly throughout the film. The first is the f-word. The other is iPad. Seriously, I think iPad might be used more than the f-word and the f-word is used A LOT in various incarnations. There is also a significant amount of screen time setting up the improbable way all of these people will get the opportunity to see this video; Jay gets new iPads at work, puts a playlist on the iPad, gets a new iPad, gives the old iPad away to friends and family, but his new music selections continue to get synced to the iPads. When he realizes the mistake, he and Annie have to visit everyone and get their iPads backs before they watch the video synced to their iPad. Hi, do you have the iPad I gave you? I kind of need that iPad back? The iPad I gave you with the music? The playlist is the gift, not the iPad! Wow. It is easily one of the most obnoxious uses of product placement in a movie, even more than Transformers: Age of Extinction. At least in Transformers they promote different products. In Sex Tape, Apple must have been a co-producer. I can't think of any other reason a product would become a character in a film. Too bad they didn't pick a better film.

The first act is all build up to the creation of the sex tape. After a few bad starts, they finally decide to make a video and set-up an area of debauchery in their living room. Okay, here we go. They open The Joy of Sex and start reading before the film cuts to the next morning. Its an interesting decision, to not show any of their amateur work, and it sort of promises that there will be something even wackier coming up. Cutting out any part of the sex tape seems to say there isn't enough time for that. Wait till you see what we have up our sleeve.

When Annie and Jay realize what happened, they visit friends to retrieve their tablet and then realize one of the iPads was given to Hank (Rob Lowe), her potential new boss, and they have to get that back. They go to his house and find him alone at home. Jay begins to search the house while Annie tries to keep Hank occupied. This scene seems to go on F-O-R-E-V-E-R. And the filmmakers try to make it funny (some visual gags in Hanks house are amusing), but Hank just comes off as creepy. Lowe simply smiles the whole time, in a lecherous, pedophile kind of way, and the things he does while Annie is around are just wrong and unfunny.

When they finally leave Hanks they have to go to a few more places, and then another obstacle and then another.

But none of these shenanigans live up to the promise of the sex tape. It simply doesnt deliver.

As mentioned, Kasdan makes two mistakes... In the final moments, there is a barrage of material meant to be funny. This same material could have been used throughout the film, to punctuate Jay and Annies journey to retrieve the iPads, giving us little moments of laugh-out-loud raunchiness. But instead, it is all at the end of the film. A missed opportunity if you ask me.

The other mistake is to have Rob Lowe play Hank. Rob Lowe was probably an obvious choice for the film, given his own reported history with sex tapes. But he is playing a creepy guy, who does strange things, and it just sort of reinforces all of the preconceived notions we may have of the actor. And he isn't funny. Just creepy. Did I mention that he seems a little creepy?

In the beginning, Cameron Diaz seems to be portraying your common middle-class mom, (although 'middle-class' - by Hollywood standards - their house is huge and they live in a tony LA- area neighborhood) she seems fairly natural. Post sex tape, she becomes a little more hyper, but she strangely seems to be dow- playing Annie. It makes for an odd, not entirely satisfying performance. She showed more range in The Other Woman, and that was a pretty broad comedy. Jason Segel also seems to be going for a more natural performance until they begin the hunt for the iPads. Once they start to visit their friends and family, Segels Jay seems to become a male Lucille Ball, getting into one physical altercation after another.

Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper (TVs The Office) play a married couple, Jay and Annies best friends. They have a couple of amusing moments, but nothing so funny you will remember it beyond the viewing of the film.

Jake Kasdans first film Zero Effect showed a lot of promise. It was strange, offbeat, funny. Since then, he has worked on television shows (Ben & Kate, New Girl) and disappointing films like Walk Hard and Bad Teacher. I think the common theme among his films is they seem incredibly forced. The funniest films have at least a thread of naturalness running through  the situation creating the laughs or comedy may be forced and unnatural, but at least you believe the characters would get into this situation because something about them makes them real to you. If everything seems forced, it becomes more like a television sitcom where everything happens at an accelerated pace because they don't have the time to let things happen in a more real environment. Kasdans real-life moments just don't seem all that real and only add to the artificial nature of the narrative. This happens again and again in his films and seems to indicate he doesnt have the ability to pull them off. Unfortunately, ""Sex Tape"" does nothing to reverse Kasdan's trend and only seems to be more of the same, showing us that maybe this once promising director has little new or exciting to say.

Sex Tape is a movie that squanders its few funny moments and spends too much time, way too much time, on material that isnt.",1406246400,6,7639,4.4471428571428575
6508011,2,B00LU7K55M,"Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz star as Jay and Annie, a married couple with a couple kids living in a nice suburban neighborhood.  Everything seems hunky-dory except their sex life has all but disappeared.  No time, what with Annie's blog and Jay's...uh, whatever it is that he does.  Kids graduating from the 5th grade.  Oh, the horror of it all.

Jay has a habit of buying scores of $600 iPads, loading them up with his most recent musical playlists then giving them away to family, friends and even the mailman.  So generous.  In order to spice up their love life, they decide to make a sex tape on the iPad.  I suspect I can stop now, because even a casual film watcher can guess the rest of the story.  Yep, Jay ""forgets"" to delete the video and mistakenly synchs it to all of the iPads his given away.  So the rest of the film has the couple tracking down iPads before they see the video.

Even if you get past the unlikely premise, the film fails from a poor script, a lack of comedy and worst of all, very few naughty bits.  Sure we get to see plenty of rear-enders.  And as Jay says to Annie, ""your ass is your best part."" Well, he's right about that.  But no frontal and just a whisper of side-boobal.  Save your money.",1406160000,2,1227,4.296943231441048
6508012,4,B00LU7K55M,"Okay.... This will be a PG-13 review about an R-rated movie. Rest assured, this is every bit as raunchy as the title would imply as we watch a happily married couple discover that the personal sex tape they made the evening before might go viral. (Their sex life has become humdrum, so they try all the variations in the book, ""The Joy of Sex."")

The first part of the film shows us the lusty beginnings for this couple, directed with a fairly heavy hand by Jake Kasden (""Bad Teacher""). Their early life together is lots of fun and establishes their characters. We always want some to root for and this is a very likable couple. I found the double takes and reaction shots a bit overdone, although the actors gave this project everything (and I mean EVERYthing) they had.

Here is part of the cast:
  * Cameron Diaz (""The Other Woman"") Annie is a generous, loving (and very flexible!) woman who adores her family. She may have a buyer for her blog, which would set her up with a welcome income. This actress will cherish this film long after her shelf life expires; she looks terrific!
  * Jason Segel (""This is 40"") Jay is successful, stable and a bit over-domesticated. When he discovers that their home-made tape may be in ""The Cloud"" he has to admit not only does he not understand it, NO ONE understands it! BTW, I have never seen this guy look so appealing.
  * Rob Lowe (""Parks and Recreation"") Hank is a charming businessman interested in expanding Annie's readership for his wholesome, family-oriented publication (but check out what he has in his bedside table).
  * Rob Corddry (""In a World"") Robby may be a good friend, but he and his wife Tess (Ellie Kemper) would really like a peek at that video.

Expect lots (and LOTS) of nudity, profanity, drug use, and simulated sex. To my relief, I saw no gunshots, no vehicular mayhem and no blowie uppie stuff, but there is a ferocious dog. I laughed out loud many times but it would have been even funnier if the mugging had been toned down a bit. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.",1406160000,,2053,4.521621621621621
6508013,3,B00LU7K55M,"Whats it about?

A couple make a sex tape and it accidentally gets uploaded to a bunch of synced iPads. They frantically chase the iPads.

What did I think?

A sex tape is often a source of entertainment, cringe worthiness and titillation. This one certainly has all three but not in any large quantities.

There are certainly laughs here  though possibly not enough to sustain 94 minutes  but there was an odd chemistry between Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz that didn't quite mesh. Its a B-Grade comedy about sex that feels too long. Some interesting commentary on sex inside marriage but nothing overly original outside of some blatant iPad promotion. Not bad ,but like most sex tapes, perhaps wait for the DVD or download editions.",1406073600,,733,4.824
