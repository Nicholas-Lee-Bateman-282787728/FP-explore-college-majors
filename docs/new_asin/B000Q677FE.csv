8194677,1,B000Q677FE,"terrible,terrible, terrible. Mainly bought it because they had sabu on the cover and in many interviews the ecw originals say that xpw was the place to be , that it captured what the original ecw was all about. what a load of crap ,all it is glorified backyard wrestling with some money. the prime example if you run the company(if you could call it that) don't involve yourself in the action/storylines yourself.as it started playing it was all down hill from there.  I can say the only ""exciting"" part of this whole thing is the intro . it looks so badass and its like i can't wait to watch it and then boom! clips of bad matches , terrible promos, and very bad production and terrible commentating mainly that idiot ""cuban"" guy. during a lot of the promos it looks like the cameraman is messing with the settings during the whole thing. I don't know how many times i wanted to throw a brick through my tv. makes me appreciate the indy shows in my area that aren't much better than this garbage. how these guys got a tv deal beats me. whats sad is that a lot of these guys on the cover aren't in the dvd, false advertising? Anyways top it all off when these guys went out of business, the owner is looking for someone to buy the rights to this s*** fest, mainly the wwe. I laughed my ass off when i read that crap. I guess the best bet for these guys is to put it on a free cable access channel and see if it catches on again.save your money and just youtube this stuff , save your money.",1445212800,,1490,4.228070175438597
8194678,5,B000Q677FE,"I had always heard about XPW and how they were beginning to get attention mainly via the internet. Television exposure was limited unlike their competition. Getting to see these episodes on the first season set was exciting. Matches I've never seen, rivalries renewed, and twists that most wrestling promotions only imitate now. This is a must buy item.",1242777600,,353,5.103448275862069
8194679,1,B000Q677FE,"Since most critiques have voiced like opinions to my own, I'm gonna try to render mine in a nutshell. Please consider the following before you assume that this is worthy enogh to compare XPW to ECW:

1)The set is full of snippets and highlights as opposed to full length matches(the best of which can be found in the Episodes/Matches features).

2) There are actually some good matches...but given all of the fragmented matches, the only one worthwhile over all is the main event: Sabu vs Abdullah the Butcher. As a matter of fact...Sabu is the only reason I purchased this set to begin with.

3)The action is great at times, but the quality is amateur.

4)I found Shane Douglas's comments about Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and the like to be tasteless(considering he failed in WCW, WWE,ECW and TNA).

5)Avoid the episode feature unless you're into sleazy drama plays and pointless commercials/interludes...it's like watchin' B grade WWE, xtra cheese.

Again...this is only a keeper for the action and for Sabu. I also enjoyed Messiah, Supreme and the like. But if you're looking for more action thatn drama...go for TNA, ROH, or old school ECW instead.",1219708800,2,1147,4.88659793814433

Gripe one:
WARNING!!!THERE ARE ONLY A FEW FULL MATCHES IN THIS COLLECTION!!!
I hope that got your attention. I got this Dvd because the box says it has matches from some old faves of mine Sabu, Shane Douglas, Chris Candito and Abdullah the butcher as well as public enemy and the pit bulls. Well i was lied to... You will not find a complete match of these wrestlers in the entire ten hours. This dvd set only features highlights from the matches.

Gripe two:
Quality is HORRID! I can usually look past something like this considering the older ecw footage was poor. But this was supposed to be the year 2000! It looks closer to the year 1989. Did they steal my parents 1989 RCA camcorder to film this? Oh man, that reminds me. In the ""special features"" Is where the three (and only) full matches are... And they were filmed by a fan in the audience! But thats not the worst part... the fans footage is the best quality out of the entire ten hours!

Gripe three:
The announcing literally made me mute my television. They don't announce per-say. They more like tell you what your looking at on the screen. Isnt that what you have eye balls for?

I cant tell you not to buy this dvd. I can only ask you this... would you like to own four hours of wrestling clips plus four hours of the worst acting in wrestling history and MAYBE a few hours of crappy matches sprinkled with the worst ""commentating"" your ears have ever had the misfortune of hearing? If so this is the dvd set for you. But if your like me and a little thing like quality and substance matters then i would get either ECW's blood sport or extreme rules.",1199491200,11,1669,4.342948717948718
8194681,1,B000Q677FE,"This review reflects the product (DVDs) in question. It does not reflect on the promotion itself. First off the compression or Bit Rate is to extreme. In other words the video quality is not the best. My VHS recordings made via A1-TV via C-Band Analog Satellite Feed are far superior in Audio / Video quality. The music is different than the original airings. The language is totally edited. Nudity and kissing between Lizzy & Kristi is blocked out. The adverts for Kristi Mist & Jasmine St. Clair have been deleted. The episodes have been edited down to approx. 38 minutes, not the 42 minutes (minus commercials) they ran when first aired. The keepcase stores all three DVDs in one stacking ring and the DVDs are very difficult to remove. To say the least this 3 disc set is a total farce which I should have expected from Big Vision. If you didn`t watch or record these shows when they first aired then you will probably enjoy this set but what a let down to loyal fans and the promotion itself. Although I don`t approve of Rob Black`s adult films (which landed him in jail) I really feel for the wrestlers and how their matches and interviews have been butchered. They probably receive no residuals from this set either. Contractural agreements guys, not just a paycheck. This advice from a past AWA employee. Enjoy, if you can?",1190937600,7,1331,4.6440677966101696
8194682,4,B000Q677FE,alright after reading over 50 peoples reveiws of xpw i think its time somebody spoke on xpw's behalf. i am tired of people saying that xpw is crap and that this organization cant premote. yeah well id like to see you promote wrestling. its not exactly easy you know. but anyway this product im writing a reveiw for is supposed to be 13 episodes and in my opionion is a pretty good idea.,1185840000,2,386,4.301369863013699
