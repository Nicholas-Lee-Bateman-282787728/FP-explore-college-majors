7897716,5,6305943567,"This is definitely a must buy for film lovers. I really enjoyed watching this special. Love to see the famous scenes of the screen legends in one DVD. Whether it is Henry Fonda having his ""I'll be there..."" speech, Audrey Hepburn crooning Moon River, Bette Davis in a ""bumpy ride"", Stewart with the Holocaust and fireworks speech, Stanwyck seducing Fonda in Lady Eve, Joan Crawford slapped in the face by her daughter, Gable not giving a damn, Cary Grant in Mount Rushmore, Brando's I could've been a contender, Gene Kelly singing in the rain, Judy Garland over the rainbow, Bergman and Bogart enjoying Paris, or Hepburn giving her knight in shining armor speech to Fonda in On Golden Pond! I mean honestly it's overwhelming I want to cry because all of these actors are gone (large majority of them). Very moving and nostalgic.

 The stars who gave their insights were very passionate with their comments. You can just feel that they were inspired as actors by these people. Sharon Stone cried when she was talking about Katherine Hepburn. Bridget Fonda couldn't hold her tears when she talked about Jimmy Stewart, Goldie Hawn cried by the mere mention of Judy Garland or Cary Grant. It was a touching mini tribute by the speakers.

Some of my favorite guest stars are Whoopi Goldberg, Cher (she loved Audrey Hepburn, her eyes just sparkle like a child when she talks about her), Richard Dreyfuss, Jim Carrey, and Sharon Stone.

As for the rankings, well of course there will always be arguments about their placings. Personally I would've chosen Jimmy Stewart as the #1 screen legend instead of Bogart. Dietrich lower and Stanwyck a little higher, And also where's Deborah Kerr in the list, I think she should've been there and also Olivia de Havilland. As for those who did not qualify because of the criterion that he/she has to have his film debut on or before 1950, such great stars like Jack Lemmon (one of my all time favorite actors), Paul Newman, Shirley Mclaine, Clint Eatwood were left out. Maybe they'll make it in the next list but they seemed out of place there, with actors probably like De niro, Jane Fonda, Michelle Pfeiffer, Streep, Pacino, Hoffman, Nicholson making the list.

I love this DVD, just buy it. It's a very personal experience watching the special and it's definitely something you would want to watch more than once or twice.

7897717,5,6305943567,"The American Film Institute (AFI) & over 1800 Leaders in the Film Community in 1999 determined the TOP 25 Male & Female American Film Legends from a compiled list of 250 Nominee Stars. The final 25 Male & 25 Female American Film Legends were determined...
Many are critical of this Top 100 (50) American Film Legends List, while others praise it.  I found after I understood the judging criteria the Final 50 American Film Legends were justified.  This was a subjective decision based on the following criteria:  STAR QUALITY (charisma, screen presences, mythic persona), CRAFT (acting aptitude & versatility), LEGACY (body of work), POPULARITY (fame) & HISTORICAL CONTEXT.  Must be feature length film greater than 60 minutes.  Screen debut on or before 1950 but whose death has marked a completed body of work.
The TOP FEMALE LEGEND - Katherine Hepburn & TOP MALE LEGEND - Humphrey Bogart.
AFI's 100 YEARS - 100 STARS America's Greatest Screen Legends is now on a Full Screen DVD (135 minutes).  A 3 hour CBS TELEVISION SPECIAL, Hosted by Shirley Temple with a cast of over 50 stars & Hollywoods Best star commentaries.
This 3 Hour CBS Special was presented in a 50 Legend countdown starting with the #25 Female & #25 Male Legend Stars, Ava Gardner & William Holden.  Many Guest Stars & Movie Professionals provide commentary and statements regarding their favorite Legends.
This is an excellent DVD & a very delightful collectors edition.  Shirley Temple does an excellent job in hosting this Legend Special.  A must for the DVD FIlm Library.
The AFI DVD series introduces us to the complex world of the American Film Legends over the first 100 years.  With this list whether we agree or not allows us to experience & get to know these Film Legends & their contribution & how they are immortalized forever in the American Film.

SALIVATE over the wonderful clips of these stars and then RUN to the closest movie rental star so you can see the ENTIRE FILM!  You will be AMAZED at how many of these stars you have never seen!  You will be OFFENDED that your favorite stars are ranked so low or left off the list entirely!  You will ARGUE with your friends over this list, but NOT as much as you did with AFI's 100 Years, 100 Movies list.  You will compare the STARS OF TODAY to these GREAT STARS OF THE PAST and find them pretty inferior.

7897719,5,6305943567,"Many, many years ago, there was a terrific television special called ""Life Goes to the Movies"" which was packed with great film clips from the whole history of cinema.  Unfortunately, this is not available anywhere, but this AFI program is one of the best I have seen on the movies since then.  While the previous 100 Years, 100 movies was okay, it suffered from too much talk and not enough clips.  The AFI has learned from that error and given us much more time on clips, which is what it is all about, the movies we love, right?  The special focuses on stars who entered films 1950 and before, and whose careers were completed by the time this special aired.  The modern stars talking about the past screen legends are very affectionate tributes to people who inspired them.  I can highly recommend this DVD.",978393600,9,811,4.597222222222222
7897720,5,6305943567,"This is a wonderful t.v. special counting down the top 50 American acting legends.
 It is  done in two parts-the top 25 males and the top 25  females.
 Even though I disagreed with the ordering of the list, I can't  complain over the number one stars. Also, even if your favorite star isn't  number one, you can still see clips of there films if they are one the  list.
Although only 50 stars were honored by the AFI, 50 more introduced  them, so that is why it is titled so.
Also by the AFI-100 Years 100  Movies, and 100 Years 100 Laughs",967680000,3,539,4.205882352941177

It goes through the AFI'S choice of the 50 greatest stars ever to grace Hollywood presented by 50 of today's stars. It  provides commentary of the defining roles of such stars as Bogart, Brando,  Stewart, Grant and the Hepburn's.
