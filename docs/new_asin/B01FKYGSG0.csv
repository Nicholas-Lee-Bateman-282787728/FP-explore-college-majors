7750735,4,B01FKYGSG0,"After reading the reviews from May 2016, and then the October 1, 2016 review, I purchased this box set.  When I received it, the DVD package clearly showed the Region 4 symbol.  Based on the October 1, 2016 review, I contacted Amazon via the call back feature of the help page.  I got a call within seconds of clicking ""call now.""  My question to the customer service rep was ""Did I receive the wrong box? Ie: Are there two different items sold by Saver Sales where one is 'Region Free' and the other Region 4?""  I didn't want open the package, have the disks not play in my Region 1 player, and then not be able to return it.  The Amazon rep looked into the item, and after a brief hold, advised me that because it was fulfilled by Amazon, I would not have a problem returning it after opening.  She recommend I open it and test it.  I went a step further and did the test with her on the phone.  As Season 3 was the primary reason for the purchase, I spot-checked Season 3 Disk 1.  After inserting the disk in to my Region 1 Panasonic DVD player (SA-HT920) the Copyright title card appeared, a good sign.  Then the VIAVISION title card. Then the DVD menu appeared.  The video was stable.  The sound clear (no pops, crackles, hiss, etc) from what I could hear.  I selected the second episode so as to see middle of the disk.  The episode played.  The image was not the best quality in that it looked like the video was a transfer off of a screen (a ""poor-man's"" Telecine transfer as I could see vertical lines equally spaced on the background image, an underwater ocean scene).  But otherwise, the video played with clear audio.  Because I still had the Amazon agent on the phone, I only scanned about 20 seconds of Episode 2, and moved to Season 3 Disk 3 to spot-check that.  Again, Copyright title, VIAVIDEO title card, and then the menu.  Selected the second episode on the disk, and it too played.  Conclusion:  Though the package showed the Region 4 icon, the disks I spot checked played successfully in my Region 1 player as noted above.  That DVD player is connected via Y,B-Y, R-Y component to a Samsung 52"" LCD TV (LM52A630M1F). Neither S-Video output nor composite (NTSC) output was tested prior to this review's posting.  I included the model numbers of my testing devices because not all customers may have the same experience with their own tests with their own devices, as every manufacturer can be different.  I did not test any of these DVDs in DVD players of other manufacturers.  Season 1 and 2 disks not tested prior to this review's posting. [I seldom write reviews for anything I purchase as I value my privacy. However, as a Broadcast Television Engineer, I felt a review with the results of the testing I performed may be of value to other buyers.  Also, the Amazon rep could not herself post the success of the testing as she heard from her end of the phone call.]",1477958400,22,2889,4.463740458015267
7750736,1,B01FKYGSG0,"In my younger days, I loved this series and still do.  But typical of modern day marketing I won't be able to get the full series.  I bought seasons 1 & 2  as soon as Amazon offered them, and was disappointed to see that Season 3 was ""Currently Unavailable"".  Now there is an offering of the entire collection including season 3 as a package.  But I already have seasons 1 & 2  and I'm not a big fan of redundancy, so until Season 3 comes out as a standalone product in a format I can use in the U.S., I guess I'll just save my cash and do without.",1477958400,4,548,3.981651376146789
7750737,5,B01FKYGSG0,we loved sea quest when it was on tv we are very happy to fineley have it at last thanks.,1477612800,2,89,3.5
7750738,5,B01FKYGSG0,Wow! What a find!,1475452800,,17,3.5
7750739,4,B01FKYGSG0,The best thing about this collection is that it includes the final season. Despite what other reviews say this is playable in all regions.  I know that for a  fact because I asked Amazon directly and they were able to confirm this. It was explained to me some folks did receive defective discs. That actually ended up happening to me too. But they sent me a replacement set the fastest way possible. These discs have no playback problems at all.  They seemed genuinely concerned about this and are doing what they can to make sure it doesn't happen in the future. So I would definitely recommend this set.. Perhaps not the best sci-fi show ever but it has some memorable moments worth revisiting!,1475280000,6,696,4.642276422764228

7750742,2,B01FKYGSG0,I also bought this item as it was listed as being playable in all regions.  Found out it only plays back in region 4.  False advertising.  Seller should be corrected about this.  Hope not too many more buyers get conned.,1464652800,18,220,4.425
7750743,2,B01FKYGSG0,"I live in Region 1.  This was advertised as viewable in all regions.  Before I got through Season One my VHS/DVS player began to develop a vibration that cause a ""chattering"" noise audible when the DVD was fairly quiet.  I thought it was the player so I bought a new one.  When trying to play the last DVD of Season One, it began an even louder vibrating noise immediately.  Took the machine back to the store and they tried it without problems.  Brought it home, other DVDs played just fine with no vibrations.  Thought I spotted a flaw on the last DVD that wasn't on the ones from Season Three, so I tried to play it. Not only did I get the same vibration and ""chattering"" noise, it would not play at all.  I only purchased this collection because I thought I would finally be able to get DVDs for Season Three that are viewable in Region 1.  My $90.00 DVDs, in the end, cost me $261!",1464566400,31,886,4.25748502994012

7750752,5,B01FKYGSG0,"I love to watch this series, I have the first two seasons but it was hard to find season three so when I saw this I bought it.  I contains all 58 episodes from the three seasons.  There are great guest stars that appear in the series and even some surprise changes of crew between seasons 1 and 2 and 2 and 3.  There is even a change in command in the third season and two of the civilians on board become officers to be able to stay of the boat.  Each episode deals with real issues and gives a sense of what it would be like to be on a ship under the water.  This is a great series about life under the sea and how we can live there.",1479600000,5,635,3.816793893129771
