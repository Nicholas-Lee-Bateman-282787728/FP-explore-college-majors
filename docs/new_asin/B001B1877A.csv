8281083,2,B001B1877A,"UFC 9 is the weakest outing for the UFC at a time when they were facing mounting financial and political problems.  Those political problems actually led to this being a horrible event.  The Detroit government were considering banning the event even the week it took place.  In an effort to avoid having to cancel the event the UFC agreed to only open handed striking (closed fists were a violation of the rules and actually the law).

The main event has been dubbed ""The Dance in Detroit"" as Dan Severn and Ken Shamrock squared off in the last SuperFight title match (the winner was placed against Mark Coleman to become the first HW title holder in the UFC).  But for most of the fight the two seemed scarred to engage and they circled endlessly before any action happened.

The undercard featured Don Frye, Gary Goodridge, Mark Schultz, Cal Worsham, and Zane Frazier.  But it is hard for that action to erase the memory of the main event.",1301184000,2,941,4.632530120481928

1. ZANE FRAZIER VS CAL WORSHAM-the first fight does not go to long after the feeling out process. Cal gets it to the ground and pounds out his opponent, this is actually a good fight from the early days. Good display of ground and pound from Cal. 4/5

2. RAFAEL CARINO VS MATT ANDERSEN-this is another pretty good fight this time between two newcomers. It goes much like the first fight with Carino taking it to the ground and working into the mount. Once he gets it he starts laying bombs on Hendersen and it is over. 4.5/5

3. MARK SCHULTZ VS GARY GOODRIDGE-this is an excellent fight right here with both of these warriors. Mark dominates this fight and cuts Gary open bad. But Gary never gives up and makes the time run out taking shot after shot. The doctors won't let it go to over time and Mark wins. 5/5

4. MARK HALL VS KOJI KITAO-this is a very quick fight only lasting 40 something seconds with Hall taking the victory after Koji broke his nose. Very fun fight because of the adudiance. 4/5

5. DON FRYE VS AMAURY BITETTI-this has got to be the best fight of the night as these two battle it out. The fight lasts all the way into the over time period with Frye taking a hard fought win. Still Frye dominates the last half of this fight and Big John stops the fight. 5/5

6.[SUPERFIGHT] KEN SHAMROCK VS DAN SEVERN-this is the rematch from their historic first encounter were Shamrock was the victor. This one though is the exact opposite as nothing happens in this fight really for the entire 30 minutes. They just circle each other and exchange very few short times. Severn shoots in at one point and Ken gets the mount. Still nothing really happens. The deal with this is they were told before the fight not to strike each other with fists. This was during the time when senator John McCain was trying to change the rules and every thing. During the last couple of minutes of the fight Severn turns the tables and punishes Ken from the top. The first over time looked just like the first round, circling. The final over time is the same until Dan gets that last second take down. Dan gets the decision win and the super fight belt. 3/5

this was a good event even though the main event was a bit of a disappointment, still a worthy addition to the collection.",1250380800,6,2278,4.371158392434988
