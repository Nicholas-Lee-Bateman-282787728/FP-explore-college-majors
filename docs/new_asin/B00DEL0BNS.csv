8592555,2,B00DEL0BNS,"This series falls well below its predecessor, ""Living with Lions"". While it tries hard to apture behind the scenes moments, it's editorial slickness makes the end product seem more documentary than fly in the wall. Sterile and without emotion on just about every level.",1390089600,,269,5.136363636363637
8592556,5,B00DEL0BNS,"The 2013 Lions Tour was one of the greatest sporting events in years and an outstanding advert for the game of Rugby. Having not won in Australia since 1989 the team faced a huge task and succeeded at the end in dominant fashion with a victory that fans of any sport would find thrilling.

This compilation shows what it takes to succeed, including behind the scenes footage of how a team should be on tour. It also has all three Test Matches, the last one of which is worth the price on its own.

I can't wait for Lions Tour 2017 to New Zealand.",1389052800,,546,4.240384615384615
