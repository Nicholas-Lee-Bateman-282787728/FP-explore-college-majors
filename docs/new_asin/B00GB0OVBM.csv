8621762,5,B00GB0OVBM,"These are amazing video performances from some of the giants of 20th century classical violin and cello.  If you have any appreciation for these instruments and their astounding classical repertoire this collection is precious. For better or for worse it is also a documentation of the progress of audio and film/video recording and musical film/television/video production.  But the technical restoration of these recordings has created a product where an appreciative listener and attentive viewer can enjoy the essence of these performances without the technical realities detracting excessively.  This is a slice of a past reality you can't get otherwise.

The music is entertaining, these performers are stellar.  I've been fascinated by Nathan Milstein's live and playing, and you get a healthy serving from him here.  I also appreciate the Giltis material which I haven't heard or seen before, he is quite amazing.  And so are the other greats on this archival collection.  I can't wait for the volumes with Heifetz, Oistract, Sigretti, Elman, Perlman, Mueller, Hahn, Miadori (you can be living and still be great!), etc.",1406937600,,1128,5.369318181818182
8621763,5,B00GB0OVBM,"The concept behind this series of long-playing Blu-rays:

Quite apart from the considerable musical content of this disc, all of which has been seen and heard for the purposes of this review, the huge playing time probably needs some explanation for those of a sceptical disposition. The Blu-ray format has a capacity of several DVDs in just the same way that DVDs have more capacity than VHS tapes and, in an earlier generation, LP (long playing) records had much greater capacity than 78 rpm records

The greater capacity can be used in two ways. Usually it is used to carry High Definition files which, because of their high definition, require much more capacity. However, it would be just as possible for the Blu-ray disc to use its greater capacity to have much longer playing times when the source material is of lower resolution and thus requiring less capacity per item.

Technical considerations:

That is what has happened here. The original source material is that of television broadcasts taped on video tape and at the quality associated with television broadcasts of the 1960's and 1970's. Videotape could be described as Low Definition by contrast with modern High Definition recordings. Consequently we are able to experience all that broadcast material conveniently gathered together on a single disc.

Audio-video recording has been an area of great advancement since these live broadcast recordings were made. The quality of these recordings falls far below the standards achieved by EMI for example in the 1980's or Metropolitan Munich in the 1980's-1990's. As described above, these are standard definition recordings made at a time of infancy in that area of recording. Modern standard definition recording, let alone HD recording, is vastly superior and fundamentally a totally different product in terms of recording quality. In addition, those wishing for equivalent audio recording, LP or CD source, from the 1950's will be greatly disappointed. That, however, is to miss the point entirely. These recordings derive from French broadcasting of very limited audio-video quality but of high value in terms of archive footage which is otherwise unavailable. It is on that specific basis that these recordings must be judged and will appeal mainly to collectors with that interest in mind.

The contents of this disc and general observations

Thus we are introduced to the work of the following key violinists - Ferras, Gitlis, Grumiaux, Milstein, Stern and Szeryng plus cellists Fournier, Rostropovich and Tortelier. In a review of a disc of this duration and coverage it would be invidious to single out items of superior merit. However it is fair and essential to note that each soloist is well represented with some core personal repertoire and that the 'live' nature of the broadcast material ensures a degree of special frisson which, for many, will overcome the obvious deficiencies of the recordings of those times.

The 10 featured soloists average out at just over 104 minutes each. They are shown playing a range of music typically including at least one representative concerto plus chamber music. The concertos are usually played complete as well as the shorter items such as Ravel's Tzigane. Other items can be represented by individual movements rather than complete works, but none of the movements is heard incomplete. The featured concerto works heard complete are Ivry Gitlis playing a simply scorching Tchaikovsky concerto, Szeryng playing the Brahms concerto, Stern playing Mozart concertos 3 & 5, Milstein playing the Beethoven concerto, Grumiaux playing the Beethoven and Mendelssohn concertos, Kogan playing the Beethoven concerto, Ferras playing the Sibelius, Stravinsky and Mozart 4th concertos, Rostropovich playing the Shostakovich 1st and the Prokofiev Sinfonia Concertante, Fournier playing the Schumann and Saint Saens 1st concerto. Each of the soloists plays a range of smaller works, many of which are also heard complete. It will be noted that the concertos are all major works which have particular significance in terms of the featured soloists.

This is a collection that makes no claims of being comprehensively finite in terms of the featured string players or their featured repertoire. What it does offer is a valuable resource chronicling the work of some of the finest exponents of violin and cello playing from the early days of television broadcasting. As an inevitable consequence, it also offers purchasers the chance to observe these famous musicians at an earlier stage in their careers and at a time when some were still in the process of establishing themselves or confirming their eminence. As such it deserves the gratitude of interested collectors who will find it to offer very good value as well as musical illumination.

Summary:

This collection will be of great interest to those who have an interest in historical recordings and these have been gathered together and presented as a very convenient collection similar to that of the Classic Archive of Strings to be released shortly. The use of the Blu-ray format with its larger capacity has been imaginatively used to maximise access to a considerable amount of historical material which might otherwise have been lost to collectors of such material.",1393459200,7,5284,5.2562277580071175
