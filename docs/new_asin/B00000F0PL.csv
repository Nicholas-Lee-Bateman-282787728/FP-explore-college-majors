This is a powerful documentary.  Its strength is in its depiction of the dehumanization of soldiers during World War One and the futility of this war.  Some of my students have been moved to tears and most have recorded (in their journals)a new-found respect for war veterans.  I highly recommend this.  (A great companion documentary is The Great War.)",1035417600,4,479,4.734939759036145
