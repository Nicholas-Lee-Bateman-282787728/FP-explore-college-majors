8215346,5,B000UWMSHG,"I teach a Modern Asia history class and was looking for videos that my kids could watch.  Although this video is slow, the analysis provided by its commentators is great.  This is a primetime TV special from 1966 hosted by Walter Kronkite.  It tries to cover Minh's rise to power.  This video covers how Vietnam could have been helped by the West but was shunned.  Thus, there was a possibility the USA could have avoided conflict.  It also offers analysis of what intellectuals (not hippies) thought of the Vietnam War.  One man says to the effect - Vietnam is an underdog to beat the USA, the US is not France, but if anyone can do it Ho Chi Minh has the resolve to see it through.  No interviews with the Vietnamese or American politicians, but still a great Walter Kronkite special.  Recommended to have some background knowledge before watching this video.",1363046400,2,861,4.6490066225165565
