5061803,4,B0077PBPVE,"So very Charles Dickens...
It matches the title, because it was an absolutely shoking mystery!!!!!! It was the story of a mad man, who unseemingly to the rest of the world he lived in was unhinging at the seams. It was super twisted.. there were times in this period drama where i did not know how the movie would end.",1344124800,,318,4.316666666666666
5061804,5,B0077PBPVE,"Being something of a Dickens purist, I very rarely watch new adaptations of his novels, television or otherwise, and after being badly disappointed by the BBC's 2011 soap-opera-like adaptation of ""Great Expectations"", I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film; in fact, I didn't even catch it when it first aired on PBS. After reading the novel (or half of one, anyway), I really wanted to see this and find out just what kind of ending the filmmakers came up with. I was astonished at just how excellent it was, and would rank it as one of the best productions of Dickens I've seen since ""David Copperfield"".

""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" was Charles Dickens' last novel; he was only able to complete half of it before he died in 1870. He intended his story to be a thriller, requesting that his publisher accept the book in twelve parts instead of the usual twenty. That being said, the film reflects that ideal in spades, clipping along at a nice pace that rivals even the best modern-day mystery novel and incorporating a healthy dose of psychological drama for extra suspense. The dramatic tension is there from the very first scene and doesn't let up until the end credits roll. Highly atmospheric and oftentimes chilling, it would be hard to imagine a more ideal production.

The second half falters a little bit, owing to the the lack of true Dickensian dialogue and plotting, but the numerous twists and turns and surprising character development never really feel as though he couldn't have written them himself. Some people might dislike the ending, but I found it unexpected and very appropriate. Dickens wasn't above resorting to using the ""deus ex machina"" device himself, so who's to say it doesn't belong here? While he probably had a different though equally surprising finale in mind, the one devised by screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes isn't exactly shabby.

The only real reservation I had about this film was that it would feel too ""modern"". To my delight, the historical side of the film is never once questioned: there's never a single moment over the course of all two hours where you don't feel that you're truly in 19th century England. The fact that it was actually filmed in Rochester, Kent, the place where Dickens based the fictional town of Cloisterham upon, gives it a whole new layer of authenticity.

I was also quite impressed with the cast. Not only do they look their parts, but they also perform them flawlessly, giving real yet Dickenesque portrayals. Freddie Fox is entirely wonderful as Edwin Drood, literally embodying the phrase ""laissez-faire"". Tamzin Merchant is a steady yet perhaps a little too pert Rosa Bud, but that would be my only complaint. The true star of the show is Welsh actor Matthew Rhys, who just lives and breathes the dark, brooding, obsessive opium-smoker John Jasper. He brings out the character's passive-agressiveness to perfection, and his intense, emotional performance will keep you on the edge of your seat.

In short, I absolutely loved BBC/Masterpiece's 2012 adaptation of ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"", and would recommend it to anyone as one film not to be missed.",1337904000,81,3138,4.902071563088512
5061805,1,B0077PBPVE,I could not bring myself to finish watching this piece. Acting was unimpressive-the story line was very disjointed. Did not grab my attention in any way! Big disappointment.,1337558400,5,173,5.214285714285714
5061806,5,B0077PBPVE,Very well done cast and crew. Mysterious and eventful storyline kept me involved to the very end. Excellent in all aspects.,1334620800,4,123,4.904761904761905
5061807,1,B0077PBPVE,"This is a lazy, monotonous production of a Charles Dickens novel that has captivated and frustrated reading audiences for over 100 years.  Our fascination with the novel, albeit an unintended fascination due to his death while writing it, is that each reader can imagine how Dickens would have continued the story.  We all get to ponder whether Jasper killed Edwin Drood or just thought he did.  This Masterpiece production should have focused on the unfinished, yet still substantial novel; should have given more time to the memorable minor characters; and should have allowed the viewers to decide where the story should go.  Instead, an unaccomplished script writer, Gywneth Hughes, ineptly chooses an ending that she thinks would be appropriate and rushes the viewers through to the end.  The second half of the Masterpiece production by Ms. Hughes overplays the gothic motif to the point of absurdity.",1334534400,17,907,5.184931506849315
5061808,1,B0077PBPVE,"The sets were good and the actors did the best they could, but Dickens' story was truly bastardized -- along with most of the cast!  It started to get comical -- who would be revealed next as a bastard?

And blaming poor Mrs. Crisparkle for Jasper's addiction was unfair to a delightful character.

And not only did they provide a very mingy ring to represent Edwin's mother's ring, they changed the story and he gave it to Rosa!

I could go on and on, but this production was really a mess.",1334448000,13,491,4.362637362637362
5061809,5,B0077PBPVE,"It was the novel Charles Dickens never finished. Halfway into the narrative, he suffered from a stroke and died the following day, leaving his mystery unfinished. No one knows how he intended it to end, but after a viewing of this recent adaptation by the BBC I must admit, it has a certain Dickens-esque style.

There is only one woman for John Jasper (Matthew Rhys). Unfortunately, she happens to be introduced to his younger nephew, Edwin Drood (Freddie Fox). An ambitious young man who dreams of foreign travels with a cherub face but has too little respect for his fianc to please his uncle, he cannot seem to understand how blessed he is to be engaged to such a lovely girl. But Jasper is profoundly aware of it, so much so that his opium-induced fantasies in a darkened corner of a local den often include dispatching with his blonde nephew and taking his place in Rosa's arms. His attention is unnoticed by most but not by Rosa (Tamzin Merchant), who is uncomfortable with his affection and seeks to avoid him whenever possible. Having remained silent on the matter, she confides her concern to her new friend, Helena Landless (Amber Rose Revah), a recent arrival to the school from India.

Unfortunately, that very evening Helena's hot-tempered brother Neville (Sacha Dhawan) and Edwin come to a dispute in Jasper's rooms over the young man's treatment of Rosa in public, which leads to an estrangement that threatens to grow into something more as Jasper's obsession with the young woman deepens. His obsession with the crypt beneath the church also causes suspicion when Durdles (Ron Cook) is hired to carve a new monument for one of the graves, and the child commonly about the church and grounds has an encounter with the older man that leaves him shaken. But none of them are prepared for what is to come... and some of them may not emerge from it unscathed.

Writing an ending for a famous unfinished novel is no easy task, but I was impressed with this adaptation that takes a different twist than former versions I have seen. The writer consulted as much information as she could find about Dickens' intended ending and crafted a story that easily fits into his usual style, with frequent twists and turns in the final hour that bring all to light. Although this two hour film feels too short and ends rather abruptly (it is a conclusion that made me smile but long for more), it's also very cleverly written and full of the same wonderful characters Dickens is so known for, ranging from shut-in bookkeepers longing for fresh air to the ornery little boy who is always about chucking stones at people. It has occasional moments of sheer wit and hilarity, such as when the child complains that the singing of the choir could put a ""good man off his lunch,"" but also some downright creepy material.

The best thing about it, however, in my opinion is the casting - Matthew Rhys is a brilliant John Jasper. He has the charisma to draw the audience to him and make them fond of him, even sorry for him, while at the same time hinting at a darker temper that keeps us continually on edge. Whether brooding in a corner or ""devouring Rosa with his eyes,"" he mesmerizes us in a way that few actors accomplish. Some have complained that the second half is convoluted and absurd, with plot holes and melodramatic scenes, but I disagree... I think it is brilliant. I loved it and its darker nuances, as well as how neatly everything ties together based on small but significant clues in the first hour. That said, I would have liked another hour in which to further pursue some of the secondary characters and plot lines!

Maybe this isn't the ending Dickens envisioned when he created the unusual story of obsession and revenge but it is an entertaining and deeply thought-provoking way to spend an evening.",1331251200,75,3815,4.696562032884903

5061814,5,B0077PBPVE,"I had always put off reading this so was pleasantly surprised that it was so....Dickensian after all.  Durdles, the young scamp & Bazzard  - great Dickensian characters who really saved a very dark tale. Darker than many others, near the end of his life, have to wonder what else he might have created, but that this has been made is great.  I wonder how differently we evaluate John Jasper today versus back then. His drug addiction, his view of Neville, the ""romantic"" obsessiveness, the hypocrisy - so many current themes. All in all, this production made me laugh, made me fearful, disgusted & hopeful, what I expect from Dickens.  And Matthew Rhys - role after role, he is excellent.
BTW, the Matthew Pearl book - the Last Dicken - good book I may need to 're-read now",1468108800,5,773,4.62043795620438

5061829,4,B0077PBPVE,"A well worked out solution of the mystery Dickens left unfinished at his death, although I suspect Dickens intended the fair Rosa to find a new suitor in the seaman Tartar, who was not included in this rendering of the tale. Lovely portrayal of the character of Mr. Grewgious warmed my heart. Matthew Rhys convincingly obsessed and dangerous, the young Landless brother and sister nicely done as was the muscular Christian, Mr. Crisparkle. Ian MacNeice gives a wonderful performance as the amazingly vain Mr. Sapsea, and there's a most original presentation of Bazzard / Datchery! In fact I really found all the actors and actresses did a lovely job, from the ingenue portraying Rosa Bud to the crypt-keeper Durdles. The setting was suitably dark, the cathedral music lovely. I had to go and reread the fragment afterwards.",1465689600,,823,5.014598540145985

5061910,1,B0077PBPVE,I think they should have left this story unmade into a movie. Characters are weak and the story is underdeveloped due to the fact that Dickens died before finishing it.

5061955,3,B0077PBPVE,"I like Dickens and this little-known story is somewhat of a departure from his more popular stories. The main character is an opium-addicted choir master who entertains fantasies about killing his nephew, who's bride-to-be he lusts after. The nephew is a total jerk so you often find yourself hoping the uncle will in fact kill him sooner rather than later. Two mysterious orphans from India appear midway in the story and provide diversion from the main characters. Without totally giving the plot away I found this production a bit slow moving.  It is worth a watch but not my top choice.",1437177600,,590,4.841584158415841

5062124,4,B0077PBPVE,"When Charles Dickens died in 1870, he left behind a half-finished novel called ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood."" It was published as-is with no conclusion, since publishers hadn't yet started hiring people to finish such books.

So there's a slight obstacle in adapting that half-finished book -- how do you adapt a story whose entire final act is missing, including the revelation of who committed the droodful crime? Well, you make up an ending. And while the big splashy climax of ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" relies too heavily on convenient timing, the story overall is an enjoyable mixture of darkness and light, with solid acting all around.

It's made pretty obvious what's going to happen at the beginning, when choirmaster John Jasper (Matthew Rhys) has an opium-fueled dream about murdering his nephew Edwin Drood (Freddie Fox).  Edwin has just arrived in town to see his fiancee Rosa Bud (Tamzin Merchant), who doesn't seem particularly eager to marry him.

At the same time, the kindly Reverend Crisparkle (Rory Kinnear) welcomes half-English twins Neville (Sacha Dhawan) and Helena Landless (Amber Rose Revah) as his houseguests. Neville immediately clashes with Edwin, whom he sees as spoiled and unworthy of Rosa. And as Rosa and Edwin's engagement goes through its final turbulence, John doses himself with opium and strangles his nephew, because he's madly in love with Rosa. Yes, this seems like a big spoiler, but we're never left in any doubt that it was him, and it's so heavily foreshadowed right from the first scene that it comes as no surprise.

Of course, Neville is immediately suspected since he got into two fistfights in one evening with Edwin -- but he rebuts with a shocking revelation. But with little evidence and no corpse, Rosa's lawyer Mr. Grewgious (Alun Armstrong) and his funereal secretary Bazzard (David Dawson) begin investigating other possible motives for murder... and discover a long-buried secret.

""Masterpiece Classic: The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" is one of those mysteries where the question is not WHO did it, but HOW the crime will be uncovered -- and in the final act, what exactly happened. It's obvious from the very first shot of the movie who is going to commit the crimes, so the suspense comes from seeing the events that follow unfold, and the toll they take on the people present.

The miniseries is half murder mystery (despite the lack of a corpse, Edwin is presumed dead... for some reason), and half study of John Jasper's slow descent into evil and madness. It also makes good use of Jasper's drug use, washing certain scenes in color, Dutch angles and weird distortions, as well as having lots of fun with crypts, shafts of pale light in a darkened church, and eerie scenes set in darkness.

Fortunately, there is some lightness in the story, mostly provided by the hobbity Mr. Grewgious and his hilarious secretary. Bazzard is like a lost Monty Python character -- a sort of goth before there was goth, making dramatic complaints and occasionally talking in an awful Scottish accent.

And all the actors do an excellent job as well. Rhys plays Jasper as a bitter creep fueled by his passionate desire for his nephew's fiancee, slowly descending into black-hearted, empty-eyed madness. Kinnear plays the exact opposite: a sweet, slightly naive man who is true to his Christian beliefs. Dhawan and Revah also give nice, barely restrained performances as the twins with a dark past, and Ron Cook as a weird undertaker who constantly refers to himself in the third person. As for Armstrong and Dawson, they should have their own wacky ""Psych""-style series.

The one big problem? The ending. Admittedly it's not surprising that the final act is not up to the standards of the preceding ones, since it was written by Gwyneth Hughes and not Charles Dickens. But for things to turn out properly, it needs a several coincidental meetings ALL AT THE SAME TIME. In fact, one of the characters pops up out of nowhere, having inexplicably told NO ONE where he was all this time. Really?

""Masterpiece Classic: The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" has a last act that stretches credibility badly, but the overall experience is an enjoyable one -- a twisted little mystery with some surprises at the finale.",1402185600,,4248,4.943899018232819

5062126,2,B0077PBPVE,"I know it's blasphemy, but I just don't like Charles Dickens. I've read every major English writer from Geoffrey of Monmouth, Spenser, and Shakespeare, through Dickens, Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, Oscar Wilde, WB Yeats, and Thomas Hardy, clear up to moderns such as Kingsley Amis, AS Byatt, Julian Barnes, Douglas Adams, Neil Gaiman, and Jonathan L. Howard. So I'm not a troglodyte, k? I. just. don't. like. Dickens. I find his dialogue contrived and his plots maudlin and saccharine. The fact that he was a horrible human being (see his systematic emotional abuse of his devoted wife) doesn't help.

I overlooked all that because of the mystery surrounding the book (it having been unfinished at the time of his death). I should have known better. I couldn't bear to watch it. All that mincing...all that smug cleverness... :::shudder:::

Dickens gets caught up in obsessively detailed descriptions of absolutely everything to such a degree that I find it hard to pick up the story line.  The last time I attempted Charles Dickens in print I found myself shouting in the middle of chapter two, ""good God man, I see it already! Now, let's get on with the plot!""  Reading Edwin Drood several years ago was a similar experience.  I thought it was a wonderful plot and I almost enjoyed it, but in the end I wasn't completely satisfied because the details often caused the story to stumble.  As luck would have it, I stumbled across the excellent BBC Masterpiece Classic movie version of Edwin Drood which was completely satisfying.  The movie was well cast with every actor quite convincing in their role.  Matthew Rhys is perfect as the emotionally conflicted, opium addicted, older brother of the favored son, Edwin Drood.  Child actor Alfie Davis, blew me away in a well-beyond-his-years portrayal of Deputy, the street urchin.  All in all, a delightful performance.",1391904000,2,1140,4.746192893401015

This has all of that, but it doesn't do it in the suspense-filled way that Dickens is famous for. This makes sense being that Dickens only completed half of the book. The added material flows seamlessly into the original material. The plots and character motivations work. It just runs too fast and is a bit too predictable to sit in the same class as other Dicken's work.

If you are a Dickens fan, I think you will enjoy this. If you are a fan of mystery and who-dunnits, you might feel unsatisfied by the predictability.

5062198,4,B0077PBPVE,"Spoilers ahead!  Of course the novel ended after only 50 percent of the book was written--there was the ""Sapsea Fragment,"" though some think Dickens didn't write that piece at all, and that it was the product of Forster's hand  Dickens did sketch out notes; and he instructed the artist he had chosen to illustrate the periodical version for which he was writing month to month, on the sorts of things that would be needed in the second half, and that's why Drood nerds--the ""Druids"" as they are sometimes known--have been arguing about this novel for many many years.  It takes big balls to go ahead and finish it, but on the other hand it's almost irresistible.

Part of the problem is what we know of the plot seems irretrievable obvious.  Many are convinced that Jasper, in a fit of opium induced madness (""wickedness"" is the word constantly in play in the novel) kills his beloved nephew and throws him into the quicklime of the cathedral underbelly.  And that the second half of the book would feature Dick Datchery bringing Jasper to justice.  But if this is the case, argued the Victorian writer Andrew Lang, there is no mystery whatsoever, except that it seems clear that Datchery himself is someone else we have already met under another guise, and his unmasking might provide a surprise.  And so, there have been zillions of continuations, but a paucity of actual suspects outside of Jasper.

The BBC version shows an awareness of many of these issues and actually surprised me with an unexpected ending.  As soon as Datchery starts inquiring (in some scenes definitely not written by Dickens) into the career of the elder Edwin Drood (thought to be long dead), well, my little mind was going, No!  They can't be playing it that way!  But play it they did and by Gad, I liked it!  The post-colonialist reading of Edwin Drood is especially marked in the new second half, but you figure, Dickens was going somewhere with the Landless pair, they weren't just dropped out of India into Cloisterham without a social justice point to make.  My friend Alistair Johnston has complained on his blog that not one single font visible in any of the many words, signs, or texts visible in this film had been invented in the 19th century, so that to a specialist like himself the show is unwatchable and, he would argue, even to one without any knowledge of typography, one's unconscious registers the disparity and smells out the falsity anyhow.  For me it was the casting that disappointed.  Matthew Rhys was fine in the part of Jasper but just too magnetic and charismatic to play the unassuming sad sack guy no one notices slipping in and out of Princess Puffer's opium joint.  Why get someone who smoulders more than Olivier, more than Logan on Veronica Mars?  And on the other hand, the young people are all properly young, but they're all ugly!  Rosa Bud is supposed to be gorgeous, well, a perfect flower, but this girl reminds me of Sissy Spacek in the last scenes of Carrie, and Edwin Drood is like something John Jasper scraped off of his shoe, what a mess.  The actor is called Freddie Fox and both first name and last name are lies!  Oh, I know, does anyone remember the US movie of 1980,""FAME""?  And Paul McCrane played the young, sad, gay boy mooning over the comedian boy?  Paul McCrane when he still had hair (big, permed. Bozo hair) and his name was Montgomery?

Curiously the adaptation makes one plot decision exactly the same as Madden does in his completion.  No spoilers here other than to say it involves Crisparkle.

What I liked about the production was that it was about a mystery not just a murder.  True there was little suspense, but at the same time, the ending, while feeling ""right"" to me, built up to a climax that could actually have been made longer.  There were also some Dickensian points that were ignored.  To those who know the book, there was no quick-lime mentioned anywhere.  But I suspect the script might have been longer initially and cut to fit a two-hour time frame (or two one-hour, if you must).

  So here is the good: Dickens' fascinating characters, fine production values, a really talented cast and a lovely filming location. An adaptation of an unfinished mystery novel is a pretty impossible endeavor so credit is deserved for even attempting the project.
 The bad: unbelievable twenty first century behaviors and beliefs wallpapered over Dickens' nineteenth century characters.  No one likes poverty, racism, class prejudice and the subjugation of women and children but it existed in Dickens' world and to create an adaptation that negates that reality is pretty feeble. The offered solution to the mystery is adequate and ties up all the loose ends in a big sloppy bow.

Because Charles Dickens never completed the story, it's been fun to see how others have tried to  tie all the plotlines together.  * The unfinished novel gives Dickens' original foundation and lets you imagine for yourself where the plot was headed (it's a little eerie to reach the last page, which ends abruptly, and realize the author suddenly died at that point!). * The odd-but-entertaining stage musical lets the audience vote on the ending at each performance (Helena Landless was a hilarious standout when I saw it at the Lakeside Players' production in Tacoma). * Of the three filmed versions I have seen, this one is my second-favorite. The actors did a fine job of making Dickens' eccentric characters ""real"" as human beings. The film is wonderfully atmospheric, and even the ""minor"" characters (Bazzard is a hoot! A new favorite from Dickens' world). It was fun, too, to see how the screenwriter worked several surprises into the ending. But if you have not seen it, I still think the BEST ""Drood"" is the film starring Robert Powell (1997?). It has all the strengths of this newer version; but is darker, more suspenseful, and presents (in my opinion) and more satisfying and fitting end.

The tale, on one level is a simple mystery.  However his production adds layers that amplify the almost alchemical symbolism of this work of art.",1497657600,,300,4.94
