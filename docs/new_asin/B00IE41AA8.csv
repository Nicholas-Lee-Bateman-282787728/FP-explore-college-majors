6260060,5,B00IE41AA8,"This was honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It had everything that you could possibly want in a movie: Excellent acting, beautiful stars, a tremendous plot, and beautiful cinematography of the most amazing spots in the entire world.  What was even more amazing about this movie is that unlike the incessant and insulting, if not nauseating at times, bs Hollywood continually pumps out these days, this movie dared to tell the 'truth' in a completely natural and yet uncensored way.

To be clear, there was nothing preachy about this film.  It simply told the TRUE story of a young man's amazing odyssey for meaning: to catch teh perfect wave.  It also beautifully portrayed the tremendous support received from a mother who simply would not give up on her son.  Her prayers would save his life, even though he was lying clinically dead in the morgue half way around the world.

If you see just ONE movie in 2018, make it this one.  You will love it, and I don't even surf.",1515974400,,988,4.605714285714286

6260073,5,B00IE41AA8,"The Perfect Wave is the true story of a surfer from New Zealand, Ian McCormack.  An atheist son of a Christian mother who prays, he rejects everything he grew up hearing in church and sets out for the ultimate surfing adventure involving the most popular destinations and big waves in Indonesia, South Africa and finally Mauritius.  The camera work is fantastic and Scott Eastwood who plays Ian does a superb job-- convincing without over playing his role.

The plot and imagery is captivating as the story progresses.  It doesn't stray too far from the details of what Ian McCormack actually experiences as he faces death.  I found this story inspiring and thought provoking.  So much so that I found his actual testimony after watching the movie and listened to that also.  What an amazing thing to be given a second chance to make a different in the lives of others.",1495497600,,869,4.753333333333333

6260090,5,B00IE41AA8,"Many years ago, Ian McCormick appeared on ""The 700 Club.""  His story was riveting.  Happy to see it recreated on film.
Glad the script fleshed out Scott Eastwood's character so the viewer knew ""Ian"" as a nice kidnot completely amoralbut one who
at least didn't do drugs or favor ""one-night stands.""
Sorry, naysayers.  I liked all the storyline from the development of the characters, to the sting, & to Ian's redemption.
Especially liked the surfer characters, Lachlan & Mark.  Simone (Marty Kintu), one of the islanders, may have been acting, but was so believable.
Didn't care for the characters, Greg, Ian's best friendorAnnabel, ex-girlfriend (too high-maintenance).

I think somebody turned the lights off.""  Horrible, horrible, WAY over-the-top acting. God doesn't say things like, ""If you close your eyes you'll never wake up"" to me!

6260100,5,B00IE41AA8,Loved it!!! I met Ian back in the late 80's when he passed out a home made vcr tape for free to share his testimony. He is an amazing testimony of a deathbed salvation and Gods love for all. This should encourage people who aren't sure if a loved one made it into Heaven. Keep praying Moms!!!,1455062400,,292,4.140350877192983
6260101,3,B00IE41AA8,"This movie certainly has some beautiful photography and lovely island locations. Scott Eastwood is nice to look at too but there is way too much back story and little of the actual event that changed Ian's life.
This true story actually occurred back in the 70's so the cell phones and flat screen TVs are quite a bit of movie magic.
This move lacks the drama that the original low budget film has with Ian giving the play by play of what happened. Even Ian's personal testimony is more cohesive and has more real drama. The The Perfect Wave just spends too much time on stuff that is not really relevant to the turning point in Ian's life.
Go to YouTube and search,' Ian McCormick: A Glimpse of Eternity' if you are interested in what actually happened to Ian on the Island or watch any of his many testimony's.",1452297600,,812,4.456375838926174

This is not a movie depicting the usual NDE. I've worked in palliative medicine and heard loads of stories from patients. It is extremely rare that an NDE aligns with a specific religion. People typically come out of an NDE LESS religious and more spiritual. They report that God is Love - literally - and that religion is invented by man. They tell us that all the specific rules of religions miss the point entirely.

6260146,5,B00IE41AA8,"Im fortunate to have purchased The Perfect Wave dvd back in February 19, 2015 for just five dollars and 39 cents (counting shipping). My preference in learning about various religious and spiritual faiths when it comes to the afterlife and heaven is what indirectly contributed to my interest in getting this dvd. Scott Eastwood plays Ian McCormack, a man born of religious parents who love him very much. Ian McCormack enjoys his life very much in New Zealand and enjoys hanging out with his friends and surfing. Ians parents seem to be supportive and understanding of his interests, but are concerned about his lack of spiritual faith. For Ian, everything seems fine and he is so passionate about surfing that he ends up successfully convincing his parents to allow him to go on a trip related to his surfing interests. My only caveat to the movie is that there were not enough scenes that I had hoped for when it came to depicting what he saw in the afterlife.

The real Ian's story is fascinating, but this is about the worst way to tell it that I can think of.

Scott Eastwood is one of the worst actors I think I've ever seen, there is not one moment in this movie that I actually believed his performance. The storyline is choppy and doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of sense the way jumps around.

6260151,4,B00IE41AA8,"Based on a true story, ""The Perfect Wave"" has good acting and a dramatic conversion to Christianity for the main character. Ian, the person the movie centers on, rejects his mother's faith when quite young, and decides to travel the world as a young adult. In his travels he has a lot of fun surfing and meeting new people. He falls in love, there is the usual movie relationship drama. Ian goes diving at night with friends, and that is where he runs into trouble. This part of the movie is extremely frustrating and annoying because he needs medical help, but others laugh at him and give him no help at all. I wanted to reach into the screen and make them help him! Knowing this is what really happened--that all those people were so uncaring and mocked him--makes these scenes very difficult to watch. This happens several times, so it's a long time before he gets help. His mother, played by Cheryl Ladd, who gets messages from God, knows he needs help and prays fervently for him. Then, a friend helps him, and Ian has an NDE (near death experience) and talks to Jesus the Christ (who, for some reason, has a British accent). Unfortunately, this happens very late in the movie, and we don't get to see how it changes his life in the drama. However, after the movie, there is some text stating how this is a true story, photos of the real person, and the influence he has had on the lives of others, and that he has brought many to Christianity. I saw this account on a show about different people who have had NDEs, and think this drama about it was well done, but would have liked to see at least half of the movie about what happened after his conversion, which is the most important part of the movie. In the movie, he talks to a friend who tells him he believes his story, has started reading the Bible, and that's pretty much the extent of it. Too much time of the movie was spent about his travels and girlfriend, so it's almost as if they got to the climax of the movie and ran out of time so they added the biography portion at the end.

6260170,2,B00IE41AA8,"The best part of this movie was the scenery.  The plot in this movie is definitely flawed.  If you merely read the synopsis of the movie you'll know that there is a life altering event for the main character but the movie doesn't get to this part until the last 10 minutes of the movie, I guess supposedly in a climax.  But really, there is no build up to this climax, it just happens, then all is well and we see just one or two minutes of the main character's changed life.  A better plot would have placed this life altering event near the beginning of the movie then showed how the main character's life was changed and how he recovered but that's not what happens here and instead the story merely plods along from one beach to another.  Add to this, some of the forced dialogue between the characters and essentially you have a very so-so movie.  I enjoyed the surfing scenes and lush beach settings but otherwise didn't care for much else.",1426636800,2,946,4.408045977011494

He finds her showing attention to another man and he assumes it is an old boyfriend. He wants to be the one and only so they break up.  Is stung by a jelly fish and almost dies and has a new death experience.  He is told to return and testify that Christ is real and we need to become believers.  The movie could have been better if it hadn't spent so much time for Scott Eastwood to wander around the world and have spent more time showing how he changed and fulfilled his mission for Christ.,1425427200,,785,4.228187919463087

6260192,3,B00IE41AA8,"I really wanted to like this film. Knowing that it was based on the true life story of evangelist Ian McCormick made me want to know more. But as a movie it left much to be desired. Of all things the biggest problem didn't stem from the source material but from the way the story is told.

Ian McCormick (Scott Eastwood) is a young man with little on his mind except for surfing. In his early twenties with no job prospects in mind, he decides to travel around the world in search of the perfect wave, a surfer's goal. His parents aren't pleased with the idea, especially when he sells his car to pay for the trip, but off he goes with his best friend on his search.

This is where things begin to take a turn for the worse. Not for Ian but for those of us watching. The movie begins to take on the feel of one of those old travelogue movies from the past, showing us highlights of the countries that Ian travels to with a dollop of surfing footage along the way. That footage never lives up to what we've seen in past films, notable THE ENDLESS SUMMER, and just seem like filler here.

In his travels Ian meets a young girl and falls in love with her. But problems follow when his jealous side rises and another opportunity for something deeper is lost in this story. She seems interested in Buddhism but that's never explored. It could have been since the underlying story of this film is one of faith, displayed regularly by Ian's mother (Cheryl Ladd) and lost on Ian. Early in the film he feels no connection to faith because he never hears God speak to him while his mother says she does. This loss of faith becomes the center of the film...except that rather than appear in the center it pops up in the last 15 minutes of the film when a life altering accident takes hold of Ian.

Perhaps it's me. Maybe it's just that I wanted more focus placed on Ian and his conversion, his acceptance of God, rather than a movie that just took us around the world showing different surfing locations. The makers of this film have been involved in numerous faith based movies and perhaps that's why I expected as much. Instead is supposed to be the most important moment in the life of the real Ian McCormick feels like it was tossed in at the last minute.

One interesting note is Scott Eastwood. Yes, he is Clint's son and at moments you will see a camera angle shoot him and be amazed at the family resemblance.  He comes off here as a talented actor and I see good things coming from him down the line. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well. I just wish there were more for them to work with here.",1413763200,12,2600,4.274390243902439

his legendary father but what I thought of this movie was that it was a true story that I am
