8388998,3,B000F9RL76,"A typical 70s generation gap film rife with stereotypical hippie vs backwoods morality.

The plot is based on new ideas vs the old establishment clich&eacute;s / a small town son who moved to Hollywood became a satr decides to ride his motorcycle back to his redneck home town where it seems all the town folk hate his successful guts.

A little slow at times / but an interesting snap shot of time and small town atmosphere ripe with gloom.",1265155200,2,441,4.569620253164557
