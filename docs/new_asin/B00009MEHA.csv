7991647,5,B00009MEHA,I love the movie. And I really like the five star performance of the seller. Great job. I highly recommend both the movie and the seller. George Peppard did a really great job as the star of Man against the Mob,1459900800,,210,4.146341463414634
7991648,4,B00009MEHA,"This Chinatown(1989) is not the original movie ""Man Against the Mob. (1988)""  Chinatown is the sequel to the original 1988 movie.  Man Against was a better movie than Chinatown in my opinion, yet the Chinatown came out in dvd and the original one never did.  All I have is an old vhs copy which I have just about worn out.  I love movies from this era and collect them, but it seems they never will come out with the original ""Man Against the Mob.""",1414195200,2,448,4.2976190476190474
