7902379,5,B0000039BH,"Woman On The Run is a true story of a wrongfully imprisoned police officer.  Tatum O'Neal delivers an authentic performance, She is clearly familiar with the role of someone put in an awkward position, but is able to stand strong to the end,having integrity, conviction and the support of her family. Filmed in the States and Canada, this is her greatest ""Adult"" performance since her earlier work.  I don't think another actress could have displayed the passive-aggression any better. Moving from start to finish.  Way to go Tatum. 180 minutes.",1112313600,,545,5.033333333333333
