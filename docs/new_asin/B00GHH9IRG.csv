6075642,4,B00GHH9IRG,"This inimitable series continues amidst Midsomer's deceptively bucolic hills and dales, whilst denizens inflict numerous creative demises upon one another. Three new, feature-length Midsomer mysteries are a welcome arrival. Of a fond and generous heart towards Midsomer, this would merit five-stars, but for the first episode and a fine cast of actors coping with material that is occasionally too contemporary, with less humorous banter between the main characters. These issues get ironed out. DCI John Barnaby is wonderfully played by Neil Dudgeon, while Jason Hughes has been given too little to work with as DI Ben Jones. On a musical note, loyal fans loved Midsomer's iconic score, composed by Jim Parker, and performed on the appropriately weird musical instrument, the theremin. Ears perked at Midsomer's spooky, inimitable opening notes. Unfortunately, a decision was made to replace the eerie theremin with a violin, resulting in a loss of continuity. There needs to be a return to charming but deadly places like Badger's Drift, with peculiar, humorous puzzles. Like a lace doily blotched with tea, Midsomer's coziness has a sinister stain, darkness seeps in at the edges.

The running time of ""Midsomer Murders, Set 23"" is approximately 278 minutes; subtitles are available; Extras: audio commentary for ""The Dark Rider"" with Neil Dudgeon and director Alex Pillai, and a behind-the-scenes featurette for ""Death and the Divas.""

""The Dark Rider""
Written by Michael Aitkens, who antagonized loyal fans with the abominable ""Death in the Slow Lane,"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-21/dp/B009D4RW96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders, Set 21</a>. Barnaby and Jones investigate a series of untimely deaths linked to sightings of a headless horseman. While Midsomer County sports a spectrum of deviant behaviors, this particular offering is overly preposterous and oddly paced, with a number of unsympathetic characters. The mystery revolves around the gentrified DeQuettevilles, who stage an historic battle re-enactment every year. There is silly competition with grating and obnoxious neighbors. At least there are bits about Barnaby, his wife (Fiona Dolman), and Sykes settling into Midsomer.

""Murder of Innocence""
Written by Elizabeth-Anne Wheal, this moody Midsomer mystery inveigles DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) with the protection a hated offender. Momentarily, the beginning is a bit off; Midsomer fans prefer views of chocolate-box villages, hedge rows, and tree-lined lanes, as compared to bleak bus stations. Hang in there. Released from jail, the parolee, guarded against angry villagers by Barnaby and Jones, lodges in a super-dismal cottage. Past and present collide, and a local barrister dies in suspicious circumstances. The accused culprit claims to be innocent of the crime he was locked up for in the first place, as well as the barrister's death. The suspense and body-count builds; layers of the past must be peeled back, while previous events ripple into the present.

Death and the Divas
This is a standout episode, classic, quirky, Midsomer, wacky and weird; thanks to writers Rachel Cuperman and Sally Griffiths, who satisfy the macabre appetites of loyal Midsomer fans. The Midsomer Langley Film Festival is underway, and it turns out our Barnaby is a fan of the lead actress and her campy, gothic oeuvre. During the festivities, a writer is murdered whilst a campy horror classic plays on the telly. The murder is ghoulishly like one that occurred in a cult 1960s horror film. This being Midsomer, further murders ensue, each one reenacting a cult-film classic.

6075644,3,B00GHH9IRG,"The latest series of Midsomer, available on Acorn, strikes out in a new direction. No spoilers, but the plots are darker, and the lurking humor that has characterized the series up to now is almost gone. The acting is still superb, the settings marvelous, and the casting excellent, but without the humor it's just another mystery. Well done, but not magical the way Midsomer's been for so long. Someone probably wanted to put their own stamp on the series, and in so doing it's less than it was. I hope enough people react to it so that the writers and directors get the message. Three stars but no more, for a previously five star series.",1385942400,158,640,4.573913043478261

6075663,5,B00GHH9IRG,Neil Dudgeon is an excellent replacement for the great John Nettles. He's just quirky enough to be interesting but serious enough to keep this a series worth watching.,1469923200,,167,5.0
6075664,4,B00GHH9IRG,"There are three Midsomer Murders in this case. In The Dark Rider, an aristocratic family, most of whom are far from bright because of inbreeding, are harassed by a headless horseman who points at a member of the family who soon dies. In Death and the Divas, two sisters are reunited after 40 years and a writer is writing a book that discloses something sinister about them. In Murder of Innocence, a convicted murderer returns and sparks a series of revenge killings.
The new Barnaby and his detective sergeant act in each of the films as they do in other films in the series: Barnaby continues to mock his protg and he, in turn, gives his boss an insight without realizing he is doing so. The stories are light and are nice for bedtime watching. They are filled  perhaps, overfilled  with red herrings.",1468454400,,804,4.615384615384615

I love M.M. so much even now that Neil Dudgeon has taken John Nettles' place as DCI. I'm hoping they will find class act screenwriters to keep the series going. I love seeing the English countryside and the strange and wonderful characters that live there, they remind me of how much I love the British acting.

Ben Jones is no longer subtly humorous, but petulant. Midsomer has always been a special place, not anchored in reality but in nostalgia. The odd contemporary notes in the new scripts are jarring, an obvious but not successful attempt to update the series. I do have to say, though, that the new Inspector Barnaby's wife is more interesting than Tom Barnaby's wife was. She was a little too perfect for words.",1411430400,,573,4.563106796116505

It is the first set after the departure of producer Brian True-May and with this set (and Set 24) there is a definite change in the tenor of this wildly popular show.  The village coziness and humour are missing along with the quirky characters that have so endeared viewers.  The plots may as well been filmed in Sheffield as MM seems to have turned into just another cops show. Even the lighting is different having an odd washed out tone and the acting seems to lack energy.  I do not blame Neil Dudgeon for this change - he's a fine actor and up to this set he was a worthy replacement for John Nettles.

He is worth better than this. Mr. Barnaby has reinvented himself and he seems to be more passive. I like the relationship between him and his wife. He is far less pompous and there are some really funny parts with him and Sgt Jones. However, Jones appeared to be more aggressive and at times quite rude to his superior officer.

6075916,5,B00GHH9IRG,I love the Midsomer Murders series. I can hardly wait for the latest DVDs to come out. And the great thing about them is that you can watch them over and over. The stories are very interesting and they do such a good job filming them.,1397606400,,234,4.108695652173913
6075917,5,B00GHH9IRG,Top of the line in British Mysteries. Great story lines and they get better with every season. The US needs to learn from the British on how to write good police shows without all the gore and vulgar language.,1397520000,,209,4.384615384615385
6075918,5,B00GHH9IRG,"How many times can you write theyve done it again? And yet that is what MIDSOMER MURDERS does over and over. The consistency of quality of the series (with the occasional exception) is remarkable and comes from a willingness on the part of the producers to spend wisely and well, securing good writers to create outstanding scripts, followed by excellent casting and production values.

True, by this time in the life of the show they're not exactly breaking new ground, but then most watchers of MIDSOMER don't watch the show for innovation, they watch because the familiarity and formula are so much fun. And as police procedural programs become more and more graphic, the soft-around-the-edges style of MIDSOMER is always a welcome return to a purer form of entertainmentone that does not rely on shock value. There are still gory bits, but always done with tongue-in-cheek good humour.

The first mystery in this 3 mystery set features a headless rider who terrorizes his victims prior to their death. Ken Russell alumnus Murray Melvin, an actor with a classic-looking face perfect for period pieces, makes a cameo appearance at the top of the show as victim #1. His presence adds a touch of the macabre to the proceedings.

The second mystery has a wonderful twist to it which really mixes things up and keeps the viewer guessing. Close call for Mrs. Barnaby!

Mystery #3 is the star of this set, an absolutely wonderful tale of two movie star sisters whose long-standing feud reminds of real-life sisters Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine, who recently made the news when Ms Fontaine passed away, feud still in place. The brilliance of this episode is that one of the sisters plays a former star of Hammer-like horror films from the 60s and 70s. Its a great touch which allows for some scenes to be imitative of actual Hammer films, utilizing two former Hammer stars, John Carson and Caroline Munro. It seems that John Barnaby is a fan of this genre and it is a quality which really endears him to MIDSOMER fans, most of whom undoubtedly have a soft spot for the Golden Age of British film making. John plays his emotional cards close to his chest and seeing him get excited about the films of his youth is quite a lot fun, making him just that bit more human and accessible, arguably the biggest challenge about replacing John Nettles on the show.

Complementing this unique and entertaining episode is a 15 minute behind the scenes featurette on the making of the show. The care taken to replicate the Hammer atmosphere and the fun of playing those outrageous, bordering on camp Hammer horror bits involving vampires and evil high priestesses is so much fun to watch. One error for the purist, however. The director of this episode mentions that John Carson played Captain Kronos, Vampire Hunter in the underrated Hammer film of the same name. In truth, Carson played the second lead, Dr. Marcus, while German actor Horst Janson played Kronos. Unfortunately, Captain Kronos, Vampire Hunter bombed at the box office and the proposed series of films it was supposed to inspire never came to pass. In light of the films failure, it is remarkable that this almost-forgotten film is referenced in one of the latest episodes of MIDSOMER MURDERS so many years later.

One other note re: the Hammer Films connection. Dame Harriet Walter, who plays diva Diana Davenport, is the real-life niece of the great Christopher Lee, who of course graced so many Hammer films. A fitting touch!

MIDSOMER MURDERS fans will not be disappointed as Neil Dudgeon continues to grow into the role of John Barnaby and makes his own mark on this wonderful series.",1397433600,,3647,4.834935897435898

Still adjusting to the new character but like that he is different from his cousin and plays the part well. Not sure his sidekick is with the new guy 100% yet so the time of adjustment seems to be realistic. A good video and hope for more to come.,1397001600,,409,4.453333333333333
6075922,5,B00GHH9IRG,Love Midsomer.  It is usually very family friendly compared to most mysteries out there.  It has well developed characters and great mysteries.

6075927,4,B00GHH9IRG,The casting of John Barnaby's cousin really was excellent.  The transition from the old the new is so smooth you just feel like you know this new character as well as the old.  As always it is a DVD of good murder with the standard Midsomer humor.  The fifth star was not given because it was too short - it left me wanting more.

But now I think he just has a dry sense of humor.  Actually Tom B would sometimes put his sidekicks down a bit too which is fine.  Now I see some appreciation for each other, and I like that.  Still miss the cast members who have retired, all of them; but these new ones are good too.  Still like the mysteries and the settings -- big old places, pubs, gardens.  We watch the series over and over and sometimes see guilty looks that we hadn't noticed before.  I've seen the early shows so many times that I can do other things while we watch.  Will Ben J ever find the right girl?",1395964800,,713,4.035714285714286

I still have not watched the last one, but Ithis is what I think so far:  The Dark Rider  - it was OK, not the best, but not the worst (I don't think I've seen a ""bad"" Midsomer Murder and I've seen them all).  It could have had some additional twists and turns, but all in all - it was Ok.
The Murder of Innocence - now this one was worth it.  I absolutely loved it, it was a wonderful twisting tale that I certainly did not expect at the end !  I can't wait to watch the last one - Death and the Divas, hope it has some surprising twists also.",1395878400,,639,3.803030303030303

When Tom Barnaby decided to retire I was disappointed but since Jones was remaining I thought I'd give the ""new guy"" a chance.  I'm so glad I did.  I never thought you could replace a main character, but I was wrong.  Neil Dudgeon is doing a fantastic job as John Barnaby.  His relationship with Jones is great, both actors have the right chemistry.  They keep making 'em, I'll keep watching 'em!",1395532800,,447,4.390243902439025

6075944,5,B00GHH9IRG,"After John Nettles' leaving spear-headed a mass exodus from the program, with the exception of Jason Hughes, I began a period of mourning.  I was more than willing to give the ""new"" MSM with Tom's cousin, John, taking the helm of Causton's CID, a chance.  I was sorry to see Nettles leave but, oh so happy that the series would be continuing.  However, I was not thrilled with Set 21 but believed it would get better when the transition from one Barnaby to the other was complete.  I was totally bummed when Set 22 seemed to be worse; I didn't like it all.  I was disappointed in the storylines.  Well, I was unhappy about a lot of things but I shared those in my review of that set.

All this backstory to tell you that I had trepidations about purchasing this set.  In fact, I wasn't going to, I even said I wouldn't, but I did during one night of sleepless boredom.  I'd seen everything!  I needed something to watch to feed my addiction to British mysteries.  In a fit of impulsive desperation I one-click purchased this set. (I definitely need to turn that off!  Note to self: Don't grocery shop when hungry and don't shop Amazon in the middle of the night.)  Guess what happened next? I had buyer's remorse!  When it arrived, I put it aside for about three weeks until again during another sleepless night popped it in the DVD player.  Oh! Bother!  I should have watched it right away.  Miraculously, in my mind it was a miracle, I loved it.  Yippee!  I've pre-ordered Set 24!

Set 23, marks a return to the original quirky but not outlandish (like Night of the Stag in Set 22) stories that made the original MSM of old one of my favorite British mystery series.  I loved the humor that once again made its way to the circumstances surrounding the deadly dramas.  There seemed to be a new affable rapport between Barnaby and Jones that was missing in the prior two sets since Neil Dudgeon's appearance.  I also noted a subtle but definite change in how John treated Jones, which gave an appearance of his having more respect for Jones than I saw previously.  All in all, I am very happy with what I see as improvements.

I enjoyed the storylines: A headless horseman targeting an aristocratic and country family? Ancient battle recreations? Great!  Murder and mayhem from the movies? Wonderful!  A weird whodunit with twists?  Now you're talking!

One indicator, I use in rating films and TV is the ""will I re-watch the episodes"" quotient.  If I will definitely re-watch...five stars.  Maybe...four stars.  Probably not...three stars.  No way...two stars.  If I ""hate"" something, which on Amazon is the one star designation, I usually don't watch the entire film and therefore do not review it.  I will re-watch Midsomer Murders Set 23.  Actually, I'm doing so right now.",1395360000,3,2777,4.630390143737166

Yes, there might be a momentary wish to return to the old cast, after all no one really likes change, but if you continue to watch the program you will find that the new cast is every bit as good as the old.

Keeping Detective Sergeant Ben Jones on was exactly the right thing to do, having him as the anchor point helped with the transition.  Although Im not too wild about John's wife... her character is a bit too narcissistic and disrespectful to her husband for my liking.  Tom and Joyce had better chemistry and were much more believable as a couple because they showed respect to one another and they worked in tandem.

I was worried about what would happen to the show when John Nettles left and was replaced by Neil Dudgeon but I have found that I enjoy his portrayal of DCI John Barnaby.  I especially love the addition of his loyal ""sidekick"" Sykes (the dog) who actually ""assisted"" DCI  Barnaby with his first case ""Death in the Slow Lane"".  Fiona Dolman as DCI Barnaby's wife is adorable and is a perfect foil for Barnaby's snarkiness.  In this series, Barnaby and his partner, DS Ben Jones find themselves investigating a  legend about a headless horseman, who seems to have returned to kill off members of one family; the murders of townspeople after the return to town of a recently paroled murderer of the son of the town's founding family; and a series of murders that appear to be copying murders from 1960's horror films starring  a local resident.  These stories will not disappoint those who are true MIdsomer Murders fans.  I'm only sorry to know that Jason Hughes (DS Ben Jones) will be leaving the show soon but I am comforted by the way the producers/writers handled the departure of John Nettles and Barry Jackson(Dr. George Bullard) so I am sure they will deal with Hughes's departure in a similar manner.",1392768000,2,1349,4.702127659574468

6075999,4,B00GHH9IRG,"I'm watching the shows and wondering why they couldn't be put in order
like first he is working with someone and then meets them in the next show
it's a bit of a spoiler
also - characters seem a little at odds with each other which doesn't seem smooth running - almost like they really are at odds with each other
need to watch more shows
(out of order I'm sure)
to see how it progresses - hopefully they are just robust actors?",1392595200,,428,4.168674698795181
6076000,5,B00GHH9IRG,"Change is always interesting.  Experimentation, too.  I'm watching to see where the risks taken will lead.  I think  our two detectives are on their way to becoming Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  I'm kidding, of course.  I still adore the series and plan to own them all.",1392422400,,277,4.666666666666667
6076001,5,B00GHH9IRG,This set is better than the previous one and will miss Ben. He is so great how he plays off Barnaby.,1392422400,,100,3.8095238095238093
6076002,5,B00GHH9IRG,"Midsomer Murders is a delightful show. I have series 1 up till this one. It is not gory, nor is it fluff. Bizarre killings, sometimes several, wonderful relationships between the main casts , quirky characters. Definite must have",1392422400,,229,5.052631578947368
6076003,5,B00GHH9IRG,"All the main protagonist actors have changed since ""Midsomer Murders"" premiered in 1997. But this is still the same off-kilter series it always was. If you haven't watched the very first episode, ""The Killings at Badger's Drift"" or read the book it's taken from, by the same name, I can recommend them. You will cringe at the weirdness and sly malevolence of Mrs. Rainbird and her son, Dennis. Thinking of them reminds me that ""Midsomer Murders"" has not been so much about real police procedure. It's always been its best as odd and arresting!

Set 23 of ""Midsomer Murders"" has 3 DVD discs or 2 BluRay discs. Episodes run about 93 minutes each. Plus there's one full-length commentary and one making-of featurette, for a total of over 5 1/2 hours of great viewing! English subtitles are available throughout and the episode viewing is in 16:9 widescreen.

The Region 1 episodes are presented  differently than they are in England. Overseas, these three episodes (which aired 01/2013 - 01/2014) are the 1st, 2nd and 4th episodes of the 6-episode Series 15.

Episode 1 ""The Dark Rider"". On the boxed sets, this episode has one extra, a commentary track.
This episode features Death by Gargoyle and Death by Headless Horseman. And not just any horseman. The wealthy DeQuetteville's have a family curse, in the form of Jeffry DeQuetteville, beheaded at the Battle of Nasbey, 1645. As Julian tells Barnaby and Jones, ""Whenever Jeffrey's seen riding around on his horse pointing at someone, it means that someone's going to die. Imminently.""
The question, of course, is whether or not someone is helping the specter dispatch his victims.
COMMENTARY to ""The Dark Rider"": I enjoyed re-watching the episode with the commentary track. Henry Collin moderates, with commentators Alex Pillai (director) and Neil Dudgeon (plays Detective Chief Inspector John Barnaby). Dudgeon says of the prologue, ""It's a great opening sequence, too. It's classic Midsomer territory."" I agree, a headless horseman is weird enough for this series.
James Collins does a superb job of playing the twin brothers, Toby and Julian De Quetteville. The commentators talk about the green screen used  in the scenes where both of him appear at the same time. The special effect is done so well, and Collins does such a good job of differentiating the brothers' walks, speech and mannerisms, that the viewer can be excused for thinking it's two actors.
In one scene, Sasha Fleetwood, a scheming neighbor, is talking to someone in the stables. Pillai remembers it as hilarious, because as they're filming, the horse kept trying to eat the hem of Sasha's dress.
A couple places, Pillai mentions that this or that was done a little differently than would be handled in a real situation. But we don't hold it against ""Midsomer Murders""!

Episode 2 ""Murder of Innocence"". This episode has no Bonus Extra.
It's evening, and a man waits at the Causton bus station. He's taking the bus to Binwell. He has a defeated but defiant look about him. We soon find out he has a reason. A group of townspeople are at the Binwell bus stop to meet him, and they aren't friendly. One shouts, ""We know why you're here. SCUM! ... You come anywhere near us, you won't know what's hit you, Felton.""
Meanwhile, Giles Harrison is leaving the Causton Country Club in a taxi. He arrives home and has just unlocked his door, when someone silently approaches and plunges a syringe into his neck.
He won't be the only victim.
But Inspector Barnaby has more to worry about than solving murders. The police physical fitness test is only a week away and Barnaby has been procrastinating. In a comic touch, he tries some emergency boot camp physical conditioning, and is not sure he'll survive it.

Episode 3 ""Death and the Divas"". This episode has one extra, a making-of featurette.
A woman sits on her couch, typing into her laptop while simultaneously watching an old vampire horror film on TV. She hears her outer door open and says over shoulder, ""Who's there?""
No one answers, but when she looks back, her face relaxes into a smile, ""Oh, you frightened the life out of me."" Since the visitor is not shown and does not reply, you know that this is the perfect entrance for a murderer. Sure enough, just as the fair damsel in the movie screams her last corseted breath, the woman on the couch is attacked, the blood from her wound spreading over her papers.
Not too far away, though, there is merriment. The newly formed Midsomer Langley Film Society is opening its first event, ""The Stella Harris Film Festival"". Barnaby is there with his wife, Sarah, who doesn't really understand his love affair with old horror films, but is enjoying him enjoying the festival.
The retired star of the festival, Stella Harris, lives right there in town. She has just accepted a giant bouquet of roses from the festival director, when she's upstaged by a new arrival. It's Diana Davenport, a movie star who's still working in America as well as England in spite of an ugly hair style. She's also Stella's sister, and they haven't spoken for 40 years. The sister dynamics are interesting and even comic. But what do they have to do with murder?
BEHIND THE SCENES, the making of ""Death and the Divas"" (30 minutes) Commentators include Neil Dudgeon (plays Barnaby), Nick Laughland (director), Jo Wright (producer), John Carson (plays an actor playing a gentleman vampire), Alexander Owen and Thomasin Rand (play actors playing Roderick Usher and Young Diana), Jason Hughes (plays DS Ben Jones) and Pierce Quigley (plays Colin Yule).
We get to see four film ""clips"" in this episode, all mimicking early Hammer Horror films with great affection. Wright says, ""One of the great things we did was bring in some of the stars of the horror films of the 60's, John Carson and Caroline Monroe."" Carson had been in 4 Hammer Horror films, including starring as Captain Kronos Vampire Hunter (1974). And Monroe had been in many vampire films. They appear in two of the pretend film clips that we watch in ""Death and the Divas"".
In addition, and by coincidence, Dame Harriet Walter, who plays Diana Davenport, is Christopher Lee's niece.

Edited to add: The next series, Set 24, continues the oddness that is Midsomer:

6076004,5,B00GHH9IRG,"We have every set of episodes from the very first and have always loved them.  Didn't know if I would like Barnaby's cousin, John, or not ~ but I do.  He has a wry sense of humor and a way of dealing with things that I like very much.  I only wish we would get more than just 3 episodes per set.  That's not nearly enough!!",1392249600,,323,3.8484848484848486
6076005,2,B00GHH9IRG,"Don't buy this drivel. Once again a wonderful series has been destroyed by writers and/or director who have turned these well-crafted, fantastic, humorous, eccentric stories into run-of-the-mill, ridiculous story-lines that insult the intelligence. Everything that made Midsummer Murders a charming success (besides the wonderful acting which is the only reason this has two stars and not one) has been stripped away making this second-rate at best. I would consider myself a fan (having bought every DVD to date) and will re-consider whether I will continue. I'm not sure whether to be relieved that this DVD collection was only 3-stories (as opposed to the usual 4-stories per DVD) or outraged (since the pricing is the same). On the whole, I think I am relieved that I won't be watching any more and that the original series will not be tainted any more by this rubbish!",1392163200,8,873,5.069444444444445
6076006,5,B00GHH9IRG,I wait for each new release and watch the dvds over and over again. Have been a fan since the beginning and have all the sets. Preordering makes it so convenient and worry free. If you like a good murder mystery without the usual blood and guts this is the show for you. It makes murder polite.,1392163200,,294,4.175438596491228
6076007,5,B00GHH9IRG,I love MidSomer Murders.  In some ways I like the new Barnaby character better than the former Barnaby. The new Barnaby has a degree in psychology and uses it to catch the bad guys.,1392163200,,181,4.323529411764706
6076008,5,B00GHH9IRG,"While I recognize that everyone has and is certainly entitled to their own taste, some of the reviews trashing Neil Dudgeon surprises me. I think he has walked into a long running institution admirably. He (or should I say the writers?) has not strayed far from the original formula but brings a nice little something extra to his role. The wit is similar, but I find his character to be just a tad more intelligent and thoughtful, and I delight in the exchanges between him and his pup.  I also enjoy the interplay between him and DC Jones far more than I did before, perhaps because there is seemingly more of a likability, a friendship between these two... the new ME brings a fresh twist also.  We seem to live in a world that doesn't like change, which is ironic since change is one of the few things we can't control. If we'd stop comparing and watch something on its own merit, we just might find we like it. If I have any complaints, it would be that I wish more episodes were included in a series instead of just 3, which seems to be becoming a standard for a lot of shows anymore.",1392076800,,1090,4.338235294117647
6076009,4,B00GHH9IRG,"They've really hit their rhythm in this grouping. Neil Dudgeon is well established as Detective Chief Inspector John Barnaby. Jason Hughes as Detective Sergeant Ben Jones is getting better story parts. His character has ""grown up"". The writing was great in this set and delightfully entertaining! Bravo!",1392076800,,303,5.468085106382978
6076010,4,B00GHH9IRG,"Not as pleased since John Nettles retired -- there was something in his approach that was more satisfying; also his relationships with his DS (Troy, Scott, or Jones) seemed more personable and he didn't ""talk down"" to them (except Troy who couldn't pass a driving course for quite a while) or treat them as ""secretaries"" (which is how I feel this ""cousin"" of Tom Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) does -- must be his psychology degree. DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) doesn't seem to have much to do  -- I hope when he leaves the show they make him a DI as they did Troy -- Jones is a lot sharper -- and he doesn't just become a MidSomer victim.

I at first thought the scripts had turned ""darker"" -- but as re-watching early MidSomers they also were dark -- it was John Nettles handling of his character that makes me convinced we didn't see how dark they sometimes were.",1391990400,,857,4.417721518987341
6076011,5,B00GHH9IRG,I just keep ordering these as they come out and love each and every one.  I thought I would miss Tom Barnaby but John is just as good when you get over the change and learn about the character and methods of the new DCI.  Keep them coming.  I know I can stream them via Amazon Prime but just love owning them.,1391817600,,309,3.9516129032258065

6076013,5,B00GHH9IRG,"My family and I agree that, as much as we loved the show before, it was getting a bit stale. We LOVE John Barnaby! The new plots give a much needed change in the right direction.",1391731200,,178,3.9722222222222223
6076014,5,B00GHH9IRG,A well written detective series.  The characters were well developed and I enjoyed the interaction between the two leading detectives.  I would recommend this series to all who enjoy crime stories with the minimum of violence and good story telling.,1391472000,,249,5.2
6076015,5,B00GHH9IRG,"There are not many shows when the main character is replaced that the show stays on tv.  But not this show, it  has stayed consistently enjoyable.  I have enjoyed the new series, just as much as the older series shows.",1391126400,,218,4.4
6076016,3,B00GHH9IRG,"I have seen all the MSM episodes with Tom Barnaby, his wife and daughter and the three different sergeants and have enjoyed them all immensely. I really hated to see John Nettles retire but it happens. I do not think that MSM is bad with Neil Dudgeon as Barnaby but it is certainly not the same series and not nearly as enjoyable. The chemistry between Tom Barnaby and his sidekick was a big part of the story lines. The subtle humor that existed among all the characters was entertaining and kept the series from being just another run of the mill murder mystery. Those traits are still there but not with the same enthusiasm as before. Neil Dudgeon is a great actor, I have seen him in many movies and the decline of the series is not his fault. He is just not Tom Barnaby. I have several of the post John Nettles episodes and find them watchable but not as entertaining as the pre Nettles episodes. Tom, Joyce and Cully are greatly missed.",1391040000,52,942,4.419540229885057

6076018,5,B00GHH9IRG,"Even though Tom Barnaby has turned over his job to his cousin John, the series is still good. Funny how you get so use to
one actor in a series that it just doesn't seem right to replace him. But I'm getting use to John Barnaby and of course Scott is
still in it, so I will continue to purchase the series.",1389916800,,306,3.9516129032258065
6076019,5,B00GHH9IRG,"Great plots and writing keeps Midsomer Murders at the top of entertainment. Cops -crime -humor -and scenic vistas, a tradition at Midsomer, as sure as multiple murders. Pay attention, because really funny one-line zingers permeate the script. Four regular cast members have managed to keep the integrity of the series intact. Guest stars too numerous to mention all. Not as gritty as some current crime shows, it's more of a mystery pleasure.

Neil Dudgeon is DCI John Barnaby, Fiona Dolman is his wife Sarah. Jason Hughes continues as DS Ben Jones, right hand man, and Kate Wilding (Tamzin Malleson) handles the morgue details.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 3 feature-length episodes
1 - The Dark Rider -Was it a jump, fall, or push off the Quitewell Hall tower? Fleetwoods and DeQuettevilles remain feuding since the mid 1600s. Barnaby and Jones seek Geoffrey the headless horseman. Myth turned reality? Mrs Barnaby creates a conflict by way of a battle reenactment. Guest stars: James Callis (Battle Star Galactica) plays twin brothers; Kerry Fox (Cloudstreet) one of the wives; and Paul Ritter (VERA) as a Fleetwood, other guests too.

2 - Murder of Innocence -Jones's first murder resurfaces. Grady Felton, convicted murder, now released, out for revenge, but finding himself a potential victim in a new murder string. Jones also has a love interest played by Georgia Mackenzie. Sarah leads another sub-plot as she attempts to turn Barnaby into a fitness fan. Many surprise elements. Abundant guests: Sam Callis (The Bill), Lisa Dillon (Cranford), Rupert Hill, Sharon Duce.

3 - Death and the Divas -Actress sisters are at the core of serial murder. An author writing about the sisters' horror film careers is the first of murder based on the old films. Seeing segments of the old film is fun for horror-flick fans. Stella's (Sinead Cusack -North & South) local honorary festival gets upstaged by her sister Diana (Harriet Walter -Little Dorrit; Sense & Sensibility). Emma (Anna Wilson-Jones -`Monarch of the Glen') is a daughter. Henry Goodman (Notting Hill) plays one sister's husband.

I really do not agree with the nay-sayers of Midsomer. The debate ended long ago for me. This show was great from the start, still is. And Brit acting stars clamor yet to have a guest role, to be killed or to do the dirty deed. Everyone desires to be a part of this continuing hit series. All the guest stars combined with a stellar regular nucleus makes for realistic drama.",1389484800,4,2462,4.995121951219512
