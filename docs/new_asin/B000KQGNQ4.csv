I have only started watching the programs, but am impressed with the enthusiasm and humor (and knowledge) of Ms. Mumma.  The shows are easy to watch and understand, and I already feel more confident about my choices at the liquor store.  Additionally, a problem I had with downloading the accompanying PDF files from the web page was promptly and graciously resolved.

I would definitely recommend these programs to anyone interested in developing a foundation in the basics of wine and wine-producing regions of Europe, and am interested in continuing my own understanding in the other regions covered by Ms. Mumma!

Well done!",1207612800,,705,4.9914529914529915
8158733,5,B000KQGNQ4,"After purchasing A Wine Odyssey- Old World Wines DVD series, a group of us got together to watch, taste and learn from the bonus DVD, Wine Essentials. Each person brought a different wine from the suggested list and we set out on our wine tasting adventure together. We found it to be very informative, and fun. Amy Mumma is exceptionally qualified and an entertaining instructor. Tasting along with Amy has helped me to hone my skills and train my palate. The companion manual that I downloaded from the website, as instructed , was very useful and a great tool for reviewing what I had heard and tasted while using the DVDs. From the description of this product, I expected to learn about wine from other parts of the world. This series delivered exactly what it promised, and then some. I didn't expect to have such a great amount of fun while learning as much as I did. Now, I think I'll do it all over again. I hope there are more parts to this series in the future.",1202342400,3,971,4.46067415730337
8158734,1,B000KQGNQ4,"I must admit I was a bit decieved with this series. My impression prior to purchase was that a narrator was physicaly going to the Old World wine producing areas, showing the viewers, vineyards, wineries and general wine making steps, but instead we see a very enthusiastic and knowledgble lady standing behind a table with a few bottles of wine from a particular region (in which  our imagination comes into effect) pouring the wine into a glass, tasting it and then gives her oppinion about the fruit used for that wine. By the way you've got to be quick to see glimps of different wine regions at the end of each chapter. Id' rather drink vinegar than watch this. Then again some people do.",1196553600,,693,4.588709677419355
8158735,5,B000KQGNQ4,"A Wine Odyssey -- Old World Wines is a fantastic introduction to the world of wine.  I've enjoyed wine for years (oops -- decades), but have never really appreciated the subtleties of different wines, grapes, regions, etc., until now.  These DVDs give you the background to understand what it is that you like about particular wines, and to be able to look for certain tastes and smells, and actually find them and describe them.  The ""bonus"" DVD, ""Wine Essentials"", is actually the cornerstone of the package.  All the basics of wine tasting are here.  It also provides wine pairing suggestions.  The other three DVDs expand on the theme, introducing you to Old World wines and wine regions.  I suspect that there's a lot to learn from these videos even if you have a solid background in wine tasting.

Amy Mumma's credentials speak for themselves, but what impressed me was that she makes enjoying wine FUN.  She educates you in a way that's enjoyable and not at all pretentious.  My wife and I have had a great time exploring the world of wine that we previously took for granted, and look forward to sharing the experience with friends!",1169942400,8,1140,4.741116751269035
