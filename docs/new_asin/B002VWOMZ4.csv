4001606,5,B002VWOMZ4,I am absolutely addicted to this series. The writing is so rich! I have to applaud the writers who took the books and turned them into this layered and quite involving series. I am viewing Season 2 now and wondering how long before I'll be able to see Season Three released on DVD.,1267315200,,281,4.320754716981132
4001607,5,B002VWOMZ4,"You will weep, you will vibrate with love for this beautiful wonderful series dealing with people that you wish you could live with and know.  I have Lark Rise  To Candleford 1 and 2 and eagerly await as many seasons as they make. I can honestly say that I feel as close to these characters in this series as I do my own relatives. The settings, costumes and scenery plus an absolutely perfect cast make this the most satisfying hours I have ever spent watching a DVD.  I could not stop thinking of the love, loyalty, heartbreak, hardships,and perseverence of these dear persons as they struggle with temptations, inner turmoil, ecstatic love and doubts as they prove over and over how much they trust and love one another and their strength and loyalty to their own beliefs and feelings.
This is not a sweet sugar coated series.  I actually flinched in some parts as reality seemed too harsh to be bearable, yet the joys and triumphs only prove that,yes, is as it was supposed to be.  It is an absolute masterpiece of how stories should be filmed and told...brought to us by a skillful and loving group of actors, writer, directors and producers who must feel and love their accomplishment with this as we feel and love their films..Thank you for such love everyone...",1266796800,6,1269,4.647321428571429
4001608,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Fast becoming my favorite show.  I thought the first few episodes were good, but the more I watched, the more I loved it.  I couldn't stop watching.  Thought provoking, entertaining.  You'll laugh & cry & think about it after it's done.  Very well done with outstanding acting.  A must, must watch.",1266019200,4,298,4.745098039215686
4001609,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I will not repeat much of what has already been written by others. The ""Christmas Special"" episode could become as essential an annual viewing as Dickens' ""Christmas Carol."" or ""The Snowman."" It is a complete story in itself and does not have its genesis in earlier episodes and does not carry the story forward in subsequent ones. So watching this episode is satisfying in that it has a beginning, a middle and an end. You can then move on to the continuing story from the events in the first season. The new maid, Minnie (Ruby Bentall) may strike you as a bit too muddled and accident prone to be true in the early episodes, but her back story emerges gradually through the series and she develops into an interesting character, and we learn why Dorcas employed her rather any one of a hundred less problematic girls available to her. Twister is revealed as not just a comical figure but that he has a mean streak in him at times. Laura will melt the hardest heart, and I defy anyone not to weep at what I consider is her strongest scene in the whole series, and that is from an actress who shines in every scene in which she appears. I am watching season three at the moment and it is every bit as good as the first two. You have some wonderful treats to come.",1264377600,15,1263,4.378723404255319
4001610,5,B002VWOMZ4,"What else can I say, but that I absolutely love this BBC period drama series!!  (I'm must admit that I'm an avid admirer of most period/historical/costume dramas; and who else makes them better but the BBC?!)

I started watching this series during the time the 1st season was airing in the UK. I fell in love with the characters, beautiful backdrop, and quaint country life of long ago.  I couldn't wait to share this lovely series with my family, so I ended up pre-ordering the 1st season off of Amazon UK.  I also ended up doing the same for season 2- not knowing if or when it would come to the states.  Thankfully,  PBS has since included this gem of a show on it's lineup!  ..I'm just wondering if we'll have to wait as long for season 3 to air, as we did for the last two.  In fact, it wasn't until season 2 had ended in the UK, that they finally started showing season 1.  ..Better late than never I guess =o)

  Anyway, you might recognize some of the shows main characters.  As was noted by another reviewer; Dorcas Lane is played by none other than Julia Sawalha, who is quite the period drama veteran (most recently she also had a starring role in ""Cranford""- another favorite of mine)!!  Then there's Brendan Coyle (Robert Timmins) whom you might remember as Nicholas Higgins in Elizabeth Gaskell's ""North & South"" (BBC).  Laura's mother Emma, is played by Claudie Blakley, who was Charlotte Lucas in the '05 ""Pride & Prejudice"", and maid Martha in ""Cranford"".

 Now to my review..  (I watched all but the first episode.)  Although a few of the characters from the first season are missing (notably ""Sir Timothy""), and some new ones introduced- it seems to flow well, and compliment the 1st season nicely.

  I adore Thomas Brown and Miss Ellison; they are quite the pair!  I'm very  glad that we're able to watch their relationship blossom and come to fruition in this new season!

One of the new characters- Minnie the maid (played by Ruby Bentall; who also appears in ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler"", and ""Lost in Austen"")- takes some getting used to though.  Even through all her childish mistakes, you can see the character learn and grow; and by the end of the season, she is likeable.

I think perhaps my favorite new character (unfortunately only a guest-star for 3 episodes), was Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty; who appears in the ""Return to Cranford"" special).  You couldn't help but be smitten with him-- right along with Laura.  This is her first taste of love; and as most ""first loves"" go, they don't last as long as one might hope (but still leave a lasting impression nonetheless).  ..I'm rooting for a reappearance of him in the 3'd season, but I don't see anything mentioned on his IMDB page.

I was also glad to see that Alf (John Dagleish.. a dead ringer for a young Sylvester Stallone) was able to come into his own in this season; and develop feelings for someone other than Laura (even if the girl wasn't that deserving).  And through it all he continues to be the pillar of strength, and competent provider for his younger siblings- just as he was in the 1st season!

Finally, who can forget the Turrill's?!  You can't help but laugh and shake your head at the funny things Twister does, and commiserate at times with Queenie.  They're a bit of an odd couple; but they make it work--most comically!  (And you'll find out a little revelation regarding their relationship in this season.)

As I mentioned earlier, there is a season 3 (so breathe a sigh of relief).  The first episode aired Jan. 10th in the UK!  ..If the season is as long as season 2 (12 ep's), then it should be available for pre-order this spring (April or May) on Amazon.uk!!  Meanwhile I'll be feverishly checking the IMDB page, and the PBS listings (once season 2 is finished replaying; it's about half over at the moment) to see when it will air in the US!  If not, I can always order it off of Amazon UK again.  If you plan on ordering from the UK, just be sure your dvd player is Region free, or PAL (region 2) compatible.  I have an inexpensive GPX dvd player (# D1816SIL) that I purchased 3 years ago, and they play fine!

My only complaint about the series, is that it doesn't have longer seasons (season 1 had only ten, and season 2- twelve episodes).  It seems like you're waiting forever (about a year) for the next season!  But I guess that can't be helped.  ..Let's just hope that there will be a season 4!!

  Oh, if you're looking for something a bit comparable from the US, please check out ""Christy"" (a short lived series starring Kelly Martin and Tyne Daly), or ""Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman"" (Jane Seymour, & Joe Lando).  Or the ""Road To Avonlea"" series from Canada!",1263254400,44,4692,4.54599761051374

In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivis Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition-A-E-1996/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)</a>). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.

By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. Being a self-made and wealthy man, James settles in Candleford, though he reacquaints himself with the residents of Lark Rise, especially Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) who used to take care of him as a young boy. James opens a fashionable hotel in Candleford, and tries to 'improve' the lives of the Lark Rise residents with mixed results. There is also a strong chemistry between James and Dorcas, though their relationship flounders between attraction and rivalry/conflict. Laura seems more mature and wiser, having learned a couple of enlightening things about the pitfalls of romance, and is taking on more responsibilities at the post office. But then, a young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms, initially. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.

There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store continue to pry into others' affairs whilst dealing with their own emotional dramas. Postman Thomas Brown's (Mark Heap)romantic (mis)adventures continue, and many more. This is truly a gem of a series, and I am hopelessly addicted to it. Each episode is well-crafted and credibly acted, drawing viewers into the lives of these mostly endearing & flawed characters, and making one feel at home in both Lark Rise and Candleford.

4001612,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Such places as Lark Rise and Candleford are towns most of us can only dream of living in.  Darling Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan), oldest child of a Lark Rise family, is sent off to Candleford to learn the trade of postmistress. That all began in Series One which I recommend you view first. See my review.  I ordered my copy of this DVD set as soon as I saw it was available.

English country life could never have been as poetic, pictorial, and enchanting as this dramatization of the lives of those living in and around the two 1880's towns of Lark Rise and Candleford. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period. All of this is to the delight of the viewer of this masterfully done TV series sure to endear any North American who has a tender video heart toward Victorian Britain. Perhaps, consider it a British mutation of ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""The Waltons.""

Filmed locations and sets are to-die-for your next vacation spot. Costumes to dazzle, delight, and disgust, depending upon the event. Every emotion you have ever felt in your past will be repeated sometime throughout this English town saga. The adapted books by Flora Thompson have never been read by this reviewer, but I can't imagine them being as fine as this TV series (and I'm a book lover). A superb British cast has perfected this story.",1262044800,35,1343,4.630252100840337

They should have started off every episode with ""The Lark Ascending"" IMHO.  I have never seen anything that captures the flavor of what I imagine rural England to have been like in the 19th century.  I doubt if it was quite this idyllic but allow me my fantasies.

Every season of Lark Rise to Candleford is essential viewing for all Anglophiles.  Great acting, stunning cinematography and a really great story line throughout.

4001925,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Season 2 of Lark Rise to Candleford is great just like seasons 1 and 3.  4 because of the loss of Fergus Drysdale as Laura's father combined with the condensed number of episodes with a finale that compressed so much that could have been spread across the 6 episodes available (instead of some of the worst episodes of the show), Season 5 is less but still must be watched to see how they wrap up the storyline.  Overall the show is one of the best stories I've watched in a long time.  The story of the poor and working class in mid 1800's England is heart warming.  Nothing in these shows that you have to send your children away from, or would offend anyone.  Simple good old story telling of how the bonds of love and friendship held together these old communities that worked so hard and faced so many adversities yet managed to prevail.  I was touched by many, amused, and generally entertained by a show I simply wish had gone on for many more seasons.  But what there is of it is a great watch, so soak it up because you'll find little to compare.  I myself see it as a combination of Anne of Green Gables, Downton Abbey and a touch of Poldark.  Loved it.",1483574400,3,1163,4.298165137614679

4002428,4,B002VWOMZ4,"This is a nice Family Series similar to Little House on the Prarie (not as sappy) or the Waltons. It takes place in Ireland probably 1800's. It is the story of several farm families living in the country (renting from rich land owners); and their interaction with those living in town. The young girl, Laura, leaves her family to work for her aunt who runs the post office in town. She enjoys it a little too much (as far as her mother is concerned) who actually sent her away, as she had too many children to care for. Laura's father is a bit of a rebel. Always ready to take on the establishment- religious or otherwise. If you want a nice show without cursing and good morale values you will enjoy this one.",1473465600,,710,4.345864661654136

4002549,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This series is so enjoyable!  We will be sorry when it's over.  It's done very well without being cheesy like a Hallmark series or a soap.  It is story driven, not emotion driven.  And it's always fun to see actors from other beloved works, like Mr. Bates from Downton Abbey, Lidia and Mrs. Foster (her ""particular friend"") both from Pride and Prejudice.",1470873600,,354,4.661290322580645
4002550,3,B002VWOMZ4,"I liked the first season, and some of the second season, and then the themes seemed to be mostly love affairs - which could be ok but it started to get old. And people were always getting upset with each other and the drama seemed a bit much. I'm not sure I'll finish any more episodes. Maybe the other seasons are better...

And for the record, I am one of 10 children, my parents weren't rich, and I didn't feel neglected. That episode where Queenie says it's better to stop at five because you can't show enough love if you have 'too many' children is ridiculous. Super annoying.

Lark Rise to Candleford is a combination of Downton Abbey,  The Waltons and Little House on the Prairie. It takes you back to when family and neighborly values, pride, hard work and integrity was the norm.  Just warm and fuzzy feel good show.

The story line always has a conflict ending in a real life outcome with moral meaning.  I like that.  My only reason for giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 or 5 star is the actress Olivia Hallinan.  As much as I would love to enjoy her character, I just can't.  I am not sure if it is the direction she is getting from the director for her character to act the way she does or if it is her style of acting.  But I find the character annoying and trite.",1468454400,2,577,4.1441441441441444

But, the plotting, too frequently, was not sensible.  Sidney's father is never mentioned again.  Making Mrs. Brown into a feminist and champion batter for a cricket team was so far fetched, it's totally rediculous.  I could grove other examples, but I'll stop with this last one.  The hamlet and town are supposed to be 8 miles apart.  That's 16 miles over and back.

4003296,5,B002VWOMZ4,"A story about real people who care about each other.  People who become heros to each other as part of their every day life.

4003300,5,B002VWOMZ4,"The episodes are entertaining and believable. Instead of the upstairs/downstairs focus, the conflict is more about those who have more (Candleford residents) and those who are poor (Lark Rise residents) and how they deal with their problems.

Some of the characters are bit over the top (to me) but this makes their idiosyncrasies more endearing. Laura and Dorcas are outstanding but my favorite character is Queenie. One of the most fun things about these British dramas is seeing the same actors in very different roles. Such a delight!,1465257600,,420,4.467532467532467

4003561,4,B002VWOMZ4,"Picturesque series with many familiar faces including Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey 's Mr. Bates) among the cast.
The episodes take place in the late 19th century in two small neighboring English country villages.  Lark Rise is rustic home to the working class and Candleford the town of the upscale merchant class and local gentry.  Distinctions are made between the residents but they intermingle often to supply much of the light drama.  Most episodes are somewhat self contained, there is an issue or problem which is usually resolved by episodes end while various other plotlines continue throughout the series.  Everything is fairly simplistic, narrated by the young heroine from Lark Rise who moves to Candleford to assist her spinster cousin, the town's Postmistress (a younger Jessica Fletcher type from Murder She Wrote) around whose post office much of the action swirls.
In all its light fare, family friendly, with good acting and some beautiful scenery for those that appreciate their English costume period dramas.",1463443200,,1028,5.288343558282208

Funny and quirky in turns, it follows the adventures of Laura who has been sent by her parents from the small farming hamlet of Lark Rise to work as postal assistant in the ""large"" town of Candleford. Much of the drama revolves around the head of the Post Office, Dorcas Lane, and how she meddles in the lives of the townspeople with unpredictable results.

The acting was brilliant as every character was carved out clearly and made memorable. i could sense an undercurrent of hostility from the writers toward Chrisitans and Christianity. The wisest and kindest of the characters were humanistic, if not, atheistic, while the stupid, narrow minded, and self righteous had an annoying zeal for scripture.  As a Chrisitan myself, it was hurtful to watch biblical principles being portrayed so erroneously.

Several months ago perusing through my amazon instant video on my kindle fire I came across Lark Rise to Candleford. It was free at that time with my trial Amazon Prime membership. Absolutely fell in love with it. Amazing character development. However, as I got busy and was unable to watch a few weeks, and then my trial membership expired I literally chose to renew my membership to watch this show, thats how much I loved the show. I finished season 1. I
A few months passed and then i had trouble finding season 2...suddenly this show isn't free anymore with Prime membership.
I eventually got rid of my kindle fire. I got Amazon's app on my Xbox as I prefer to watch my shows on a bigger screen...and I went ahead and purchased the Lark Rise to Candleford for $35...now I'm on my Xbox and searching and searching for Lark Rise on here...and can't find it!!! :-(

If Amazon could reassure me that it is indeed part of their Xbox content that would be wonderful... :\",1429660800,,1061,4.463917525773196

I watched one full season and the first episode of season 2 and suddenly it is no longer offered on Prime!  Won't pay to see the rest. One of the reasons I pay for the Prime membership is for the benefit of free streaming of older movies and TV shows, and this series is 4-5 years old.  Really a good series - was recommending it to friends on Amazon Prime but won't if there's a cost.

Please go through the customer service links and request this be made available on prime again.  I saw in another review, that someone was told by Amazon, that if enough people requested it, they would renew their agreement to offer it free with Prime membership.",1424476800,7,737,4.437037037037037

4004377,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Fall in love with the characters from Lark Rise to Candleford just as you did with the characters of Downton Abbey.  Set in 19th century Oxfordshire it is a tale of love, intrigue, hope and faith.  Told by the viewpoint of Laura Timmons a young girl who moves from the poor farm community of the small hamlet of Candleford to begin an apprenticeship as a post mistress.  Make sure you have plenty of time to sit and indulge because once started you won't want to stop.  Lark Rise to Candleford . . . my one weakness.",1419379200,,516,4.34375

4004425,3,B002VWOMZ4,"Lark Rise is indeed a heart-warming drama. There is much to love about this ""Little House on the Prairie"", ""Waltons""- style show.  The characters are well-developed and superbly acted.  The plot is at times light-hearted but deals with serious issues as well.  Lark Rise is fun, interesting, and family-appropriate for the most part.

What I don't appreciate is that the two characters portrayed as devout Christians are seen as ridiculous, backward, empty-headed, overbearing, spiritual bullies, and in need of modernization in thought and person.  In contrast, the old lady ""witch doctor"" character with all of her natural remedies, spells, consecration of trees, and practical life advice is hailed as the epitome of wisdom and kindness.  To add to that, Lark Rise seems to be a conservative veil for propagandizing nearly all modern-day liberal causes.

So, on the whole, Lark Rise is a pleasant fifty minutes of decent entertainment if you can stomach the obvious biases and philosophy.",1418083200,2,991,5.273885350318471

This is becoming a great show.  Season 3 is fantastic!  It's strange why I like it.  It is so different from today's choices - so full of heart.

Minnie, the new ""housekeeper"" is not simply carefree, she is lazy, unwilling to take on any work, careless and inconsiderate.  Minnie may not have been raised with much love, but how does that excuse her from being lazy and careless with other people's things and her work responsibility? The things she damaged were invaluable (a mother's wedding dress and a cherished bible) and it doesn't really teach a good lesson to let her stay on.",1415145600,,551,5.111111111111111

4004768,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Great family video. Has clean values and normally has an honorable theme to learn for the family. May be the type of show found on Hallmark, definitely not the tip of show found on network broadcast. Refreshing.",1407888000,,211,4.72972972972973

4004778,4,B002VWOMZ4,"This is the engaging story of two neighboring communities: the squalid Lark Rise and the comparatively cosmopolitan Candleford, which share a common post office.  The story is set in the late 1890's.  The post office is run by Miss Lane, a wealthy woman in the early years of spinsterhood, who has offered a postal position to young Laura, her cousin's daughter and a Lark Rise native. The stories all involve the people of these two towns and the class distinctions between them, with young Laura struggling to straddle the class divide.

While some of the plots seem a bit hokey and a few of the characters a bit ridiculous (i.e. Thomas the postman) the series is generally well acted (including Brendan Coyle and Samantha Bond of Downtown Abbey fame) and enjoyable to watch.",1407456000,,777,4.827067669172933
4004779,4,B002VWOMZ4,"Definitely a ""little house in the English Countryside"" type of show, with some plot lines feeling a bit dated, but the cast is uniformly good and doing their best to be sincere (and not campy).  And it's always fun to spot the actors who have become more well known for other work, such as Brendan Coyle, Phil Davis, and even Michelle Fairley.  The 'simpleness' of it means, however, that it's not for all tastes.",1407369600,,413,4.5675675675675675
4004780,5,B002VWOMZ4,"We love this series. The character development and the look at life situations without oversimplification is wonderful. Great acting.

4004793,5,B002VWOMZ4,This dramatic endeavor spotlights the complex cultures found in the countryside of England at the time.  History books fail to expose the tender relationships and delicate fine lines of the class structures.  Here is all comes to life as you can relate to those at each level of the society.  I throughly enjoyed the story line and the quality acting.  I wish there were more episodes to follow.,1406937600,,395,4.764705882352941

4004798,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This is a delightfully refreshing television show.  With so much violent and sexual content on tv today, it's nice to watch a show about Victorian England and the people who live in these two villages.  It's a calming way to end my day.",1406851200,,236,4.465116279069767

4004800,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Funny, endearing and troubling--I always feel a slight unease after watching Lark Rise to Candleford, along with an insatiable need to watch the next episode. I sense great sadness coming in this show but That's probably because I've come to love the characters so much and can't bear to see them suffer. The actors are excellent; many recognizable from other favorites like ""Pride and Prejudice"" (the movie) and ""Downton Abbey"" and the plot lines keep me guessing with twists that surprise and sometimes sadden, but never disappoint. I'm into the second of four seasons now and I still don't know if Dorcas Lane and Laura Timmins will ever get hitched....and maybe that won't be so bad if they never do. I'm still hooked.",1406764800,,722,4.878048780487805

4004804,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I love it.  To me it shows the beautiful countryside, the close bonding of the poor folk, the variety of the ""gentry"" with both their weaknesses, strengths and vulnerabilities.  It is a good escapism show for me to watch.  So much American TV angry, unkind, ""in your face"", violent, sexual, poorly written, poorly acted and predictable, that I have turned to watching the BBC shows much more.  When I sit down to watch a show I want to escape, forget the world and relax.",1406678400,,471,4.571428571428571

4004852,5,B002VWOMZ4,The best show ever! The only bad thing is that it's very short 4 seasons long and you can tell they had to try to finish the 4th season quicly. It's so romantic and beautiful. It takes you to a better place. I still cannot believe it was cancelled so soon. Their reviews were good and many people watched it. I keep hoping they'll bring it back and that it will continue to be sweet and inspiring. I haven't seen anything this beautifully done and written since I read Lucy Montgomery's books.,1405123200,,493,4.369565217391305

4004860,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Unlike Downton Abbey which is too 'special' to actually give us an episode every week ,  Lark Rise continues its study of the characters introduced in season 1.  Very skillfully done,  the stories move quickly,  and this season there are mysteries to ponder.  The characters are multifaceted and complicated just like we all are,  but nothing is contrived.  I would choose this over Downton now.  The huge gaps in time between the episodes of Downton have left me uninterested now that I have Lark Rise for 2 more seasons!!!",1404864000,,524,4.808988764044944

Each episode can stand on its own yet the series has a flow that is easy to go with.  The British actors are super and the characters are well fleshed out.  Two towns connected by communication and family ties.  Highly recommended.  If you enjoy CALL THE MIDWIFE, or DOWNTON ABBEY, you may enjoy this one.",1402876800,,464,4.337209302325581

4004911,4,B002VWOMZ4,I read the book--the series goes beyond it's scope but is true to the feel and characters.  It's good to watch something that depicts an earlier time but makes one care about the characters as people not just history.,1402531200,,217,4.564102564102564

4004916,2,B002VWOMZ4,this isn't a bad series it's just that the teenage heroine is not very interesting and nothing very interesting happens to her. when the story features her it's mostly about her love life and so far the male characters she's been taken with haven't been written to be particularly appealing. what saves it for me are the surrounding characters who are more complex and funnier. definitely worth watching but I unfortunately don't like it as much as most people do who have written reviews. 2 and 1/2 stars. P.S. the music is overly sentimental for my taste.,1402444800,,557,4.752577319587629

Give it a try and you will find yourself immersed in the daily struggles and triumphs of the good folks in Lark Rise and the town folk of Candleford.  Very well done, extremely well acted, and altogether engaging.  I cannot believe that this wonderful show appears to have been cut short in Season 4.

4005042,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Great acting and beautiful photography make this UK product a joy to watch. Also, we like that there is not bad language and there is always a good moral to the story. Someone learns a life lesson or that you can't always have what you want. If you are younger this series may seem ""quaint"" and not ""with it "". For the older crowd it reflects the values of an older time. Good stuff!",1397433600,,383,4.1891891891891895
4005043,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I am baffled by people who complain this show is too shallow.  How much television have they watched I wonder.  Can't be much, as this is certainly not as shallow as most TV fare.  Folks have noted flaws in storylines, etc, which would matter if this were a genuine documentary or meant to provide a direct story from the books written by the original author, but the show does not pretend to stick to the books, so people need to get over it and enjoy it for the period costumes, quaint characters and well written story lines.",1397433600,,528,4.422680412371134

4005063,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Great show. Season 2 follows a wonderful season 1 with some changes and decisions in the lives of the characters we've now grown fond of. New characters are introduced but it continues the same wonderful pattern of heartfelt stories. I skipped the first episode after watching the first 10 minutes or so of it. Its a bit creepy and disturbing in my opinion with the premise of the ghost of a young girl, and may be much for younger audiences or those of us sensitive to that type of subject.",1396915200,,491,4.466666666666667

Through the course of the series, the 'quirky"" characters are given their own new dimension......brought to life, so to speak.

4005072,5,B002VWOMZ4,"If you like stories that are rich in conversations and enjoy the interaction of characters appearing deceivingly different - this is a must watch. You will find characters ranging from what  we might label in the modern world, if not loud at least to ourselves,  the fool to the wise; and then you will get to discover how similar they are.

Along the way youll get to enrich your soul with the ever true quotes like Hard work is the greatest Alchemy, What a woman wants as a girl isn't the same as what she wants as a womanevery character you encounter in the serious including those that show up once and disappear will really show you a side of a human being, what appears to be buried and forgotten in the modern age delusions.

But there's a lot more here: the moral values and belief system of the country folk, the role of Squire at the time, the opportunities for women and the attitudes of men, the strong bonds of family and community.

I was swept away with the music, the scenery and the acting. I feel as if these people are my neighbors, and how I wish I had the delightful postmistress as my friend.

While touching on age-old issues normal to family and community, it does so with levity. There are several laugh out loud moments per episode. I look forward to returning to my friends in Lark Rise and Candleford, with each episode.

There are 4 seasons, each with at least 10 episodes. Each episode follows the evolution of the characters in the rural Lark Rise community, and their interactions with the citizens of Candleford. Character development is superb. The viewer becomes totally involved with each one; laughing at their joys; crying with their heartaches.

4005106,5,B002VWOMZ4,BBC has always been the antithesis of Hollywood in by-passing looks and skin and delving into character.  Lark Rise to Candleford includes 2 locales full of rich characters with individual struggles and foibles.  The story line is anything from boring.  My only criticism is the title of the series is difficult to remember.,1395878400,,324,5.0754716981132075

I start an episode when I am having tea and toast in the morning, gathering up my work related items and getting dressed for work. I find myself watching more than performing the other morning tasks.

Sometimes it seemed like the writers were rushing it and not taking the time to fully develop the plot as well as with other characters. It's too bad because this show seemed so promising.

Lark Rise  to Candleford is proof that the entertainment industry can keep it clean and still be wildly popular.

It's a nice change from today's blow 'em up, shoot 'em and kill 'em shows that seem to be plaguing today's market.",1393718400,,331,4.483333333333333
4005197,4,B002VWOMZ4,"I loved this series. The costumes and setting were beautiful. I could listen to the various accents all day long with pleasure. The acting was superb.  The feelings shared about life's situations felt real. I began to really care about many of the characters. So I watched every episode happily.  However, some of the story-lines were a little hokey.  And some of the characters were almost cartoonish, although they did develop some as the seasons went on. I agree with one person who said it was a little like ""House on the Prairie"".  It is something you could watch with children and enjoy.  I was sad to see that they cut it off in the fourth season.",1393718400,,654,4.555555555555555

4005200,5,B002VWOMZ4,Outstanding character actors. Fun to watch their skill at portraying their characters with such real and unique emotions. Engaging and addicting series that makes you dream what that bygone era must have been like.,1393632000,,214,5.323529411764706
4005201,5,B002VWOMZ4,I absolutley love this show. To me its a classic that stands right there with The Waltons and Little House on the Praire. It just really good family show. I would recommend to everyone.,1393545600,,185,4.470588235294118
4005202,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Really  enjoyed this series, having watched all the seasons within a week. Kind of a combination of Little House on the Prairie and the Walton's in the English version. Loved all the characters.",1393545600,,194,4.878787878787879
4005203,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I have watched all seasons of LR to C and find it absolutely entertaining. It's much more interest that any of the American TV shows. I wish BBC would produce more seasons of Lark Rise to Candleford. At  present, I am re-watching all of the previous seasons because with their British accents I'm sure I didn't catch all the words the first time around and the wisdom they bandy about is worth catching.",1393459200,,403,4.52054794520548

4005217,4,B002VWOMZ4,"This is ""history"" from the other side. I found myself so engrossed in the characters' story lines that I do admit that I sat and binge watched for two days and then I wanted more. Unfortunately, like all good things, it came to an end, but I truly enjoyed it. Several of the characters were ones I developed a fondness of despite their small flaws. A friend and I found ourselves wondering what had happened to Dorcas and Emma and Alfie. Recommended.",1393372800,,450,4.5
4005218,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Loved all the characters equally. Couldn't have picked any better actors for the characters their portrayed.  It was funny, suspenseful, just waiting or more.",1393372800,,158,5.583333333333333

4005221,4,B002VWOMZ4,Beautiful series! The innocence of it is so refreshing amongst all the oversexed tv shows that saturate tv today. Interesting story line and the characters were well acted. My only hang up is (that's not anyone's fault) which keeps me from making this 5 stars is I wish Laura was a bit stronger. She's was a bit too weepy for me especially since she's one of the main heroines. Other than that excellent series and there should be more like it.,1393286400,,444,4.493827160493828
4005222,5,B002VWOMZ4,Aside from the thinly veiled humanistic theology that is juxtaposed as good against the confused religious fervor of Thomas.  This series seeks to deal with the issues of the human heart that each generation must.  It does portray whether intentionally or not that a moral culture can by choosing God's goodness overcome the evil that can so easily emerge in selfish living.  Something that our culture has nearly lost track of and desperately needs such reminders from History.  For this reason I highly recommend this series that we might look into the mirror of our souls and find selfless sacrifice and the excellence of it's reward.,1393286400,,637,4.981132075471698
4005223,5,B002VWOMZ4,Wonderful weave of personalities in the two towns! Following the lives of the towns people reflects a glimpse of what life might have been in that time period.,1393286400,,159,4.714285714285714
4005224,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I love everything about this show, from the superb acting to the beautiful setting.  Although it takes place in another century and another country, I find the story easy to relate to.  The themes of love and loss, coming of age and aging, and tradition versus progress are universal and timeless.  I watch an episode of this series several times a week, and have seen most episodes 4 or 5 times.  I never get tired of watching them because it is such an enjoyable viewing experience.  I highly recommend this series.",1393200000,,517,4.637362637362638
4005225,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I don't know about many of you, but I get so bored with the traditional tv stories that are portrayed.  Every show that I watch seems to have betrayal, murder, theft, affairs, and so forth.  It gets boring.  This show is different.

The stories from this show surround simple problems that need simple answers.  I enjoyed the sense of community the show had and most of its characters.  It reminded me of watch Little House on the Prairie when I was growing up.

If you are looking for a show with sex, drugs and lots of action, then this is not the show for you.  If you are looking to grab a cup of tea, settle down for the night and find good people working together with good strong values, this is the show for you.",1393200000,,720,4.242647058823529

4005231,5,B002VWOMZ4,Love this show!  It is just a nice feel good program. I would suggest you wait sto start it on a day when you can binge watch because it hooks you in.,1392940800,,150,3.6875
4005232,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I am watching this series for the second time, and I am glad I found it on Amazon.  I love the characters, especially Dorcas and Queenie, both of whom are strong, intelligent women who know how to get their way.  It is also interesting to see the contrast between Lark Rise and the wealthier, more progressive Candleford.  I love the period costumes, especially the clothes Dorcas wears.  Ruby and Pearl are also interesting sisters, and it is fun to see Ruby learning to step out of Pearl's shadow.  This is an excellent series, totally inoffensive for younger views, and most entertaining for mature audiences.  Without preaching, it also is a study in what is moral and what is not.",1392940800,,685,4.714285714285714

4005242,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This is a wonderful show.  No crime scene investigations.  No snarky twenty and thirty somethings slinging pithy insults at each other.  If you're tired of all the junk on American T.V. drama, then just come over to Lark Rise to Candleford, which has engaging actors and engaging scripts.  Wonderful productions values.  Truly enjoyable.",1392681600,,337,5.283018867924528
4005243,5,B002VWOMZ4,We are sorry that the series was cancelled it could have gone on forever as far as we are concerned.  Such a pleasure to sit and get absorbed into the lives of the characters.  We will watch it again and again.,1392681600,,210,4.097560975609756

4005252,5,B002VWOMZ4,Enjoyed it very much. I would recommend this series to women. It isn't the type that men would enjoy. No blood & guts. Girls would like it too. Good clean entertainment. No cussing which I appreciate. Loved it.,1392422400,,210,4.552631578947368

4005254,4,B002VWOMZ4,The acting is fine and the stories teach us life lessons within a time past. Human nature is still human nature in all times of struggle.

4005258,5,B002VWOMZ4,I really enjoy learning history through story telling.  This series reminds me of Little House on the Prairie and how much the family enjoyed reading the books and watching the series.  I like this series because the stories are told well and the costumes are quite well done.  I think it is very much about how my Great Grandmother experienced life in her countryside home during this time period.  I did not know her as she was gone by the time I came along and my family had immigrated to another country.  She was the school teacher in the region.,1392422400,,551,4.47

4005261,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I just found the BBC mini series, Lark Rise to Candleford. It is an excellent story of two communities, one in the country and on the city, yet the people's stories ring true, as folks travel back and forth. They have caught my heart and teach true principles of kindness, respect, hard work, forgiveness, charity. Dorcas seems to be not only the Post Mistress but the local confidant yet has her own trials of the heart. Young Laura has so much to learn as she leaves Lark Rise to begin her service as a Postal Carrier in Candleford. Good family entertainment. A must see for those who want great acting that stirs feelings of the heart and brings memories of life and learning.",1392422400,,679,4.528455284552845
4005262,4,B002VWOMZ4,"I like this series, but will give families this bit of info.  Although there is no bad language (that I have heard yet) or nudity, if you are concerned about morality you may give this consideration.  In season 2 we find out that one character has been living 40 years with her man and they decide to make it legal.  Also, a business owner is found to have had a ""past"", and another business owner is tempted into an affair that is rejected finally because of the threat of being found out.  These things may not bother some, but then again it may others.  Depending on the age of children watching this, one could use these things to teach some life lessons.  Some may want to avoid because of these things.
I found nothing objectionable in the first season -- but then, maybe it went over my head....",1392422400,,802,4.385135135135135

There's Brendan Coyle aka ""Mr. Bates "" as Robert Timmons and also actresses we remember from "" Pride and Prejudice""--remember wild Lydia?!

4005268,5,B002VWOMZ4,A joy to watch. Life lessons in every episode. Only thing that bothers me is that Lark Rise and Candleford started out as a bit less than 8 miles apart and soon seem to become a hop skip and a jump apart.,1392163200,,204,3.880952380952381

4005270,5,B002VWOMZ4,the character are easy to identified yourself with since they are imperfect and down to earth. I love the different stories in each episode and the music. The fist season was better. Season two was a little slower towards the end it got more interesting but over all it is a great series. I am on season 3 and you get so familiar with the characters you get to dislike them in one episode and then love them in another. It shows the true character of human nature.,1392163200,,464,4.284090909090909

I wish that this show was still running. Julian Fellowes had Brendan Coyle chosen for the part of Mr. Bates in Downton Abbey when he saw him perform in Lark Rise. Please keep these wonderful shows coming.,1391990400,,352,4.587301587301587
4005275,5,B002VWOMZ4,"It is Britain's version of ""Little House on the Prairie"" with better scripts and actors.  I recommend this show to anyone who loves Doughton Abbey.

If you are fan of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" Julia Sawalha (Saffy) is the lead in this series as Dorcas Lane the manager of the post office and town authority.",1391990400,,375,4.651515151515151
4005276,5,B002VWOMZ4,Good to go back in history of the series and fill in the blanks for the latecomer.

4005280,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This is a very enjoyable series, reminiscent of Little House on the Prairie but with all the English expressions and history of that time--when railroads were new and small towns were really really small villages and hamlets.  Good acting by terrific actors.",1391990400,,258,5.142857142857143
4005281,5,B002VWOMZ4,This Series is delightful.  The  characters have depth and interest.  They are not all beautiful like so many of our American series characters are.  It is refreshing to watch and get involved with the lives of the people in Lark Rise.,1391990400,,235,4.658536585365853

4005292,5,B002VWOMZ4,I love Lark Rise to Candleford.  It is a great story line and family oriented.  There are lessons in each of the story lines.  As it goes along it builds on itself and I love it.,1391558400,,178,3.888888888888889

4005297,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This series is a true gem: warm, human totally believable plot lines, and the cinematography is unfailingly gorgeous. Brendan Coyle, Mr. Bates in Downton Abbey plays Robert Simmons in Lark  Rise, a poor stone carver. I will be sorry when I am finisheed with all three series. I LOVE IT AND HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT.",1391558400,,311,4.7592592592592595
4005298,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I really enjoyed everything about this show--characters, story lines and settings. In some ways it is ""Little House on the Prairie"" in England, but less heavy handed with the ""lessons"" and with better characters. Thought provoking but escapist at the same time. I would recommend it highly.",1391558400,,290,5.191489361702128

4005301,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Delightful! I love this series so much. It's always uplifting, and the characters each have an interesting story. Sometimes after watching a tough show like The Walking Dead, or Justified, I turn to Lark Rise to Candleford to restore my myself. If you love Cranford, Little House on the Praire, or the old Upstairs Downstairs, you will love this. The characters have their problems, but in the end, they always do the right thing and support each other.",1391558400,,453,4.82051282051282
4005302,3,B002VWOMZ4,"What could have been one of the best shows I ever watched was ruined by the fact that the devout Christians in the show were portrayed as neurotic fools.  And that the ""old pagan belief's"", as Dorcas called them, were portrayed as more sane and compassionate.  One episode had a ghost, that once was given a proper burial, was ""released"" to finally go home to eternal rest.  Another episode had the villagers believing that a tree was bleeding human blood because a woman had died and had become the tree - and the only way to ""release"" her was to perform some ritual consisting of herbs and chants.  And appearing throughout the show, Queenie, an older village woman of Lark Rise, reads tea leaves and accurately predicts the future.  And the Christians, when they react negatively to all this are laughed at or at best treated like they are overreacting.  Conclusion?.......it is respectable to believe that dead people turn into trees and tea leaves know the future, but to believe wholeheartedly that the Bible is God's sacred and inerrant word and is to be obeyed, is foolishness.  Granted, pagan beliefs were and are a part of people's lives, but to portray those as sane and the Christian belief as foolish - therein is the problem.",1391558400,5,1239,4.734883720930233

4005320,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This show is a sleeper. My Wife and I have been watching some of the British shows, trying to find some quality, and just happened onto this one. It is becoming one of our favorites. An outstanding cast, including Brendan Coyle, who plays Mr. Bates on Downton Abbey. Of all of our shows, The Paradise, Downton Abbey, Call The Midwife, and Mr. Selfridge, this one is rising to the top.",1391299200,,384,4.5
4005321,4,B002VWOMZ4,"Think Little House on the Prairie, Avonlea, Dr. Quinn, and you'll get the feel for Lark Rise. It takes you back to a simpler time with a good moral lesson at the end of each episode. It's the story of two towns, Lark Rise and Candleford, country and town, and the people who inhabit them. Central to the story is Laura, a young woman who leaves her family in Lark Rise to take a position with her mother's cousin, the Post Mistress of Candleford. As people travel to and from each place, we see the interaction of families and friends, the deep history of their connections and the changing times. You will find the characters endearing and familiar. I recognized many of the actors from other shows like Cranford and Downton Abbey. It's like spending time with old friends.",1391299200,,774,4.575539568345324

Some characters are introduced and then disappear soon after, which is a little jarring, but I didn't really care for those characters anyways.",1391126400,,372,5.065573770491803

4005334,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I adore history, but don't always love the explicit material that is sometimes included in historical television and movies.  This series is full of beautiful costumes, great acting, and is filled with wonderful and interesting stories, told at a nice slow pace.  Best of all, the characters seem sensible and of a high moral character, and it does not seem to gloss over questions of morality as the characters are faced with them, nor to put a modern spin on what people of the day would see or feel given their situation.  I love the gorgeous colors and shots of the countryside and the historical props that feel completely natural in their placement.  Very convincing and well-written.  I also love the inclusion of historical music -- music that is actually accurate in both its selection and its execution, very well researched and performed in a manner so very true to the characters being portrayed.  Because the series deals with some adult topics, I would probably not watch it with my young children, but because it deals with these topics in such a respectful manner, I would not object to my 10-year-old watching it with me if he was so inclined.  All in all, I find the series to be very believable, and nearly as much pleasure as reading a good old book.  I may just seek out the original books on which this series is based once I finish watching it.

Season 2 continues to be as well written and executed as the first season and, if anything, seems to deepen the characters and make them more three-dimensional as the season progresses.  It is very similar to season 1 and I am very satisfied with the plot progression.  Bravo!",1391040000,,1645,4.657439446366782
4005335,4,B002VWOMZ4,"I'm enjoying the Lark Rise serial, now on series 2. The characters are sufficiently quirky to be fun, flawed enough for a bit of tension between them and as likeable or as annoying as real people. The plot lines are generally tidy and if anything, a little too sweet with the real struggles of poverty and of personal shortcomings glossed over a bit with most everything coming out well in the end. I'm not saying there isn't heartbreak or temptation for the characters, but by and large they find their way handily. Though part of the continuing story, each episode is self-contained. Lark Rise and Candleford are pleasant places to visit with gentle people who are, after all, just trying to love and be loved.",1391040000,,712,4.704
4005336,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I have enjoyed watching this series .  There is not much on TV anymore so I have chosen to purchase a Roku by which I can watch programs of my choosing for much less per month.

4005440,4,B002VWOMZ4,"This is an enjoyable period drama with engaging characters.  While the towns of Lark Rise and Candleford are isolated British villages of the late 1800's, their gentle depiction reminds us that while clothing, customs, and the accoutrements of society change over time, human nature remains the same with its affections, conflicts, sorrows, and humor.

4005489,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I'm a big BBC fan.  I'm also an avid reader and though I'm not ""old,"" I love Masterpiece Theater and the older BBC shows like Midsomer Murders that have quality story lines minus all the graphic carnage.  I love series like Sherlock Holmes, Luther, Downton Abbey, and Whitechapel (which can be a bit graphic but it's definitely for the ""thinking"" person).  Something about the Brits; they can make quality television for intelligent people that many US networks cannot seem to do (with the exception of The Killing, most American shows are just over the top, and mindless, with an attitude of, ""how much can I shock you or put graphic gore or sex into each new episode?"").  Graphic gore and sex does not make for a quality show; good writing and acting does.  If you love Dickens, Austen, and other British authors, you will love Lark Rise to Candleford. Or, if you just like good-hearted, positive stories that make you feel better about yourself and life in general, you'll appreciate the show. The characters are endearing and each episode actually helps you put faith back into humanity (does American Horror Story do that, or, does it do just the opposite?) In any case, this is a gem of a show.  I only wish they had made more episodes.  Once again the BBC does it right!",1388188800,,1277,4.648888888888889

But over the long Thanksgiving holiday, it was something I seemed to be in the mood for. By the 3rd episode I was really enjoying it. Managed to get through the first two seasons during the holidays. Have since watched Season 3 and plan to watch the final season over Christmas. I'll miss it when it's over. I have to confess I'm a little bit in ""love"" with Laura (what beautiful eyes!). But I love watching Minnie as well - she's such fun. Lots of great characters and good story lines.

I have been engrossed in the goings-on of each character in this show since the very first show.  I feel a kinship to most of them.  At times, I feel as though,  I actually live in either of the two places.

So as you can see, everyone of the actors in this series has done an outstanding job.  The writers, producers, directors and all of the crew deserve high praise for all of their efforts.  We need more shows like this to enjoy.",1386806400,,547,4.201923076923077

4005633,1,B002VWOMZ4,An early 19 th century setting with modern social themes and no character consistency from episode to episode was too much to endure. Basically a period soap opera.,1381795200,,164,4.892857142857143
4005644,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Totally hooked!!!
We are watching multiple episodes at a time. Characters are really good in their respective roles. Most episodes have life lessons applicable to today. Just terrific programming.",1381708800,,196,5.793103448275862
4005645,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This heartwarming series is sheer joy!  The variation of the characters are what makes the series so entertaining.  When I first started to watch the series I was skeptical, not knowing anything about it, but that soon changes when you get to know the characters.  Great good fun enjoyment!",1381708800,,290,4.877551020408164
4005646,5,B002VWOMZ4,I wish they had more than 4 seasons of this show. This is a great family show. I would recommend it to everyone.,1381708800,,112,3.9130434782608696

4005648,5,B002VWOMZ4,The character development only improves in this wonderful series and the complex issues engaged are even more relevant--yet without seeming to impose contemporary issues on a previous era.  (See my review of Season 1),1381708800,,217,5.382352941176471
4005649,3,B002VWOMZ4,"When I reviewed the first season I found it wanting. The second season shows definite improvement though it is slight. Yay!  The story lines are still disconnected from one episode to the next. There is lack of overall coherence. But a kind of underlying cohesion seems to be building up. Dorcas, Robert, Thomas, Laura and the unfortunate Twister have interesting roles. Not to mention Emma and the Pratt sisters. This is an idyllic tale of bygone times which is still interesting to watch. It started off without much of a plan but has slowly acquired some coherence. Perhaps, this will end up as something that was slow off the mark but finished strongly. I hope it does. We will watch all four seasons!",1381708800,,705,4.7317073170731705

There is something soothing and uplifting about this show.  Great to watch before bed after a rough day.  Great acting, wonderful settings, fantastic period dress---although I wonder about the Pratt sister's taste in clothes!",1381363200,,379,5.080645161290323

4005669,5,B002VWOMZ4,"The story lines are compelling and the character development is great. You really get a feel for the period and what people were going thru in England in the late 1800's. But the stories also relate to today and what people deal with in today's society. Unbelievably, there is no nudity or foul language and it's good fare for the whole family - yet very entertaining. :-)",1381190400,,372,4.567164179104478
4005670,4,B002VWOMZ4,"I was not a fan of the first season, but I muscled through to season 2 which was much more exciting!

The Pratt sisters and the new characters bring a story that makes the whole of the series that much more enjoyable.",1381190400,,401,4.661971830985915
4005671,5,B002VWOMZ4,"The plot and characters in this series are so artistically and interestingly spun - watching one episode per day just isn't enough!  Instead of one main character that gets all the attention, and so-called action, this is an ensemble of LEAD players.  Dorcas the Postmistress, the Timmons family, the Pratt sisters, Queenie & Twister, Thomas and Margaret, the Arless' s, and all of their neighbors and friends ... each one so human.  And the premise of a small hamlet in England (Lark Rise), interacting with a somewhat larger and more sophisticated village (Candleford), with each episode rich in experiences between the two populations, is unique and entertaining.  AND there is a lesson for today's writers and directors:  the language is clean.  There are no corpses, vampires, filthy expletives, or sexually explicit scenes.  The series, not just season 2, provides an experiences with believable human beings - having a full range of experience and emotions.  I thoroughly enoyed this series, felt uplifted even when the characters met with difficulties, and was so sad when it concluded.  I just wanted to continue watching, and learning, and loving the lives of the people from Lark Rise to Candleford!!",1381104000,,1211,5.1692307692307695

4005742,5,B002VWOMZ4,Why in the world would they just stop filming this great show right in the middle of the excitement?!  It was such a nice escape from the world as it is today.  Even my 8 year old son liked it!  So bummed there's only 4 seasons :o(...,1378857600,,234,3.9361702127659575

4005762,4,B002VWOMZ4,It's a combination of Little House on the Prairie and Anne of Green Gables.  The characters are very diverse and no one character dominates.  Very charming.,1378252800,,156,4.961538461538462
4005763,3,B002VWOMZ4,"Maybe watching these episodes one after the other isn't the best way, but I found season 2 as equally uneven as Season 1. The Pratt sisters seemed to have mellowed and become less catty, but I am finding Robert's self-righteousness boring, Dorcas' sweetness-but-not-all-that-sweet trying, Thomas' religious spouting tedious, Twister's crotchetiness annoying, and a few other characters' idiosyncrasies fast-forwardable. It's well made and produced, but the story-lines are predictable and many uninteresting. And it's sad the way characters come and go like they never existed (no mention of the Squire or game-keeper from season 1, little made of Zilla's passing, etc.)",1378080000,2,670,5.71
4005764,4,B002VWOMZ4,Another great classic story about the positions in society and how basically we all share similar challenges. Great character development!,1378080000,,138,5.95
4005765,5,B002VWOMZ4,This show is well done - it is filled with thought provoking issues of life. The preformances are believable. The characters are pithy and sincere. I love their sense of humor.

4005772,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This series is well made, superbly acted, and very believable. It captures what most in America have probably only I own as a page in their Highschool history book, the developments in society during the beggining of the end of the British class system. It accomplishes believably, moral lesson, and deep character development seamlessly. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys legitimate television programming.",1377820800,,426,5.46969696969697
4005773,5,B002VWOMZ4,"All seasons of this series are worth watching.  Start at the beginning and then follow the story line all the way through.  The characters are very human, delightful and charming.  The stories are not complicated but enjoyable and as applicable today in their understanding of human nature.  There is a serious side to the series too--it is set at a time when England was facing huge industrial and technological changes.  You see the struggle in the people and the struggle of the working classes to keep themselves, if they can, out of poverty.  One can identify with all of the characters in this series.  Definitely an enjoyable watch.",1377820800,,639,4.861111111111111

4005777,5,B002VWOMZ4,This is a lovely series about the people living in the two towns of Lark Rise and Candleford.  When I first started watching season 1 I thought the story lines were just too simple.  But I've found that the stories are as complex as anything going on today with just the right amount of humor thrown in for good measure.,1377734400,,320,4.316666666666666
4005778,3,B002VWOMZ4,"Each episode has a blatantly didactic bent, which gets old.  The postmistress is a not believable paragon of altruism and faith in  humanity.  Too too perfect.  Bleh.",1377734400,,166,5.037037037037037

4005784,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This television show is beautifully acted, scripted, produced, etc.  To my taste, (and I know there are many who would disagree), this is what television should be.  The characters are real, the subject matter honest, and there isn't all of the extraneous violence, language or sexual content that would not add a bit to the storyline.  I am deeply saddened that this series only ran for a short time, as I came to truly love the hamlet of Lark Rise and the town of Candleford.",1377734400,,477,4.588235294117647

4005788,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I am so very tired of all of the tv shows that are on the networks these days.  It seems as though they are all either about zombies, forensic science, ""It's all about me"" reality shows, too much news. I want to watch a show that makes me feel good and reassures me that there is still some good in the world, people who care about each other and are not afraid to show it, and leaves you with a nice fuzzy feeling when it is over.  Lark Rise to Candleford does that in almost every show.  The characters are all well written and each has something different to offer, yet not one overpowers another.  They live their lives in these small communities, and their struggles and problems are worked out in a kind and gentle way.  At least when I watch this show, I can relax and feel the way I wish I felt on a daily basis.  I only wish there were more shows like this being made today.",1377561600,,883,4.1345029239766085

4005805,4,B002VWOMZ4,"I would love to give the second season 5 stars, and it was an enjoyable season to watch. My primary issue with season 2 is that in season 1 I loved the little stories told each episode but I also like the larger story of Timothy and Dorcas. The second season does away with a large over-arcing drama and basically has most dramas neatly cleaned up after one episode. I guess I just miss the Timothy and Dorcas story and was sort of miffed to see it go...the biggest shock, I grew to like the Minnie character who just about drove me crazy her first few episodes.",1377129600,,562,4.261682242990654

4005818,4,B002VWOMZ4,"The only problem I have with this season is that there is too much time spent on the love lives (or lack there of) of Laura and Miss Lane and not enough of the little stories about the townsfolk and hamletsfolk as in the previous season.  Also, enough with breaking Miss Lane's heart already.",1376524800,,292,4.407407407407407

4005826,5,B002VWOMZ4,"The costumes and sets/locations make it worth watching. The stories are good too. They are based books that are somewhat autobiographical, so you don't get the feeling that the charcters are viewing their world with todays ""modern"" views.",1376352000,,238,5.2894736842105265
4005827,4,B002VWOMZ4,I would recommend this show as the people are very engaging and it's just plain good TV.  I got very invested in the different people and looked forward to how things were going to turn out for them.  Can't wait to start watching season 3!,1376352000,,239,4.288888888888889
4005828,4,B002VWOMZ4,"Very good. I was tempted to give five stars. But not as good as season one.

Can get a bit cloying at times, a few of the characters (Miss Lane, Thomas Brown) can get a bit tiring after they have shown their character quirks many times. But still greatly appreciated to have a series with positive stories and lacking the typical violence and sex of other TV fare. And perhaps taken in smaller doses than I do, it might be less cloying.

A few of the episodes ""go off the deep end"" with supposed ghosts and voices being heard. Seemed hardly needed, and not compatible with the realistic tone of the other episodes.

Some of the episodes and characters are very touching. For example, the little boy Sidney is a touching character. I'm interested to see what will happen to him.",1376265600,,777,4.49645390070922

4005833,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This series is one of the best I have ever watched. The characters were cast perfectly. All the acting is superb. The emotions they express in their voices, eyes and body language makes you forget they are acting because they have really become those people. The story lines are wonderful and build on each other. You care about each person and cheer them on when they suffer adversity or feel for them when they suffer heart break and despair. I don't want this series to ever end. The BBC has produced so many wonderful programs.",1376179200,,531,4.6
4005838,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Great series, I am unhappy that I couldn't have rallied when it was airing to preserve such a well written show.  I think we should all wonder ""what would Dorcas Do?""",1376179200,,166,4.354838709677419

4005851,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Lark Rise to Candleford is an absolutely amazing program, with 4 seasons to date. It is one of a kind about two towns, on a village really, and the other a town progressing with the times.

4005865,4,B002VWOMZ4,"I equate ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" as something akin to ""Little House on the Prairie"" in its moral lessons and the interdependence of the locals.  I find it an enjoyable show when I am not interested in a heavy plot or mega-action/adventure, but still seek a storyline with some depth and thought.  These folks show the best of human nature....what we could aspire to be.",1375056000,,371,4.6923076923076925

4005871,5,B002VWOMZ4,I watched all four seasons in about three weeks or so and really enjoyed the settings and the characters. Highly recommended for Anglophiles and anyone missing their Downton Abby or Upstairs Downstairs.  Its a little more slowly paced and episodes are more self contained --not so many cliff hangers as in D.A.  But still very enjoyable.,1374883200,,337,5.0

4005909,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I am so glad I found this British series on Amazon streaming.  It's basically about two English country towns at the end of the 1800s.  Lark Rise, the farmer/unskilled laborer hamlet and the nearby ""town"" of Candleford.  The Lark Risers are proud and hard working, but uneducated - the Candlefordians also work hard, but certainly have a lot more luxuries in life and either inherited their good fortune or had the benefit of more education.  The tale is narrated by Laura, a teenage girl who leaves Lark Rise to work at the Post Office in Candleford.  Each location has its own wonderful quirky cast of characters.  Occasionally, the two classes mix when necessary.  This series has everything you could ask for - humor, hardships, tragedies, triumphs, love, passion, mysteries, rivalries, etc.  It's very entertaining and it has Brendan Coyle (lately of Downton Abbey fame)!  I highly recommend it.",1373328000,,900,5.027027027027027
4005910,4,B002VWOMZ4,I loved this series.  I got caught up in the everyday lives of these charming people. This is a must see.,1373328000,,105,4.0
4005911,5,B002VWOMZ4,Characters are fun to watch as they go through their daily lives.  Each show has been well thought out and endears the characters to you.  Nice family show.,1373328000,,156,4.535714285714286
4005912,5,B002VWOMZ4,I cannot say enough about this series that the BBC has filmed. It is a period piece but the situations and issues that the characters deal with could be those we face today. The show portrays positive family values and characters that are believable that deal with real life situations.  It is positive television done well.,1373328000,,324,4.785714285714286

4005914,5,B002VWOMZ4,This is one of my favorite series.  Absolutely love the character development.  I'd say the character development is some of the most advanced and realistic I've ever seen.  Characters that you originally think ok turn into endearing lovable ones as the series progresses.  Characters who make a great first impression evolve into more complex individuals as their weaknesses are exposed.,1373328000,,388,5.416666666666667

There is much joy to be had in this series. People argue and misunderstand, they make mistakes and break hearts, but they all help to heal these breeches, too. This is how we need to be treating each other now",1372982400,,371,4.636363636363637

4005924,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This show has a very subtle blend of spiritual values. Interesting in its rejection of common contemporary values. More of a traditional American approach to self reliance, work, and family. Seems an odd show for a highly socialist Britain. Think of the 'coin' to the kids, compare J.C. Penny. Interesting.",1372982400,,306,5.14

I have truly enjoyed this look back at the English countryside, two villages, and the interaction of two social classes. It is an escape to a pleasant, simpler time before radios, television or cell-phones. There are not even any automobiles! I strongly recommend this program!",1372982400,,366,5.116666666666666

We enjoyed season 1 very much with all its charm, wit and beautiful scenery and season 2 is equally as engaging.

4005949,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This is an intimate look at life in the country. What make it so special are the many character actors who do their jobs so well. They face challenges our society has long forgotten. From the ""Lord of the Manor,"" to the ""Post-Mistress,"" and the poor of the village, we soon realize that they are all Special People. This was a wonderful series about a wonderful group of people!",1371686400,,378,4.492753623188406

4005956,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I am transitioning from one state to another and don't have cable. I was looking for shows to watch on Roku and this had a high ranking.

I really enjoyed the series. I found myself getting somewhat addicted to Dorcus and her embraceable character. I gave in to her expression....""It's my only weakness...""

The series is somewhat corny but I don't mind that. It is enduring, manifesting human values such as kindness, nosiness, weakness, weariness, hardship and love. It is a series with substance and a great ensemble of actors/actresses. You get over any problems you have with individual characters and end up liking each for it's special contribution.

The post office setting is interesting to watch given everything is manual. The English countryside with struggling farm workers that can barely afford to rent their homes and its' neighboring somewhat wealthier community is different if you are from the U.S. but probably ends up being universal so everyone can relate in the end.

Everyone did a good job on this series from writers and producers to actors. Enjoyed it VERY much! Also, it ended well so I was relieved of this.",1371081600,,1136,4.9319371727748695

4005960,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Larkrise to Candleford was recommended to me by a friend and we love it! The relationships between the characters are real and redemptive. The father, played by Brendan Coyle, is a strong man who leads his family in love and hard work.  So refreshing to watch rather than the typical buffoon that most TV fathers are made out to be. You should watch the show from beginning to end. It's just really, really good.",1370908800,,412,4.5675675675675675
4005961,5,B002VWOMZ4,The story is warm. It reflects human's nature in both side. But it always leads to a positive way. I love it and I felt bad that BBC did not continue Season 5.,1370908800,,159,3.8484848484848486

4005963,5,B002VWOMZ4,"While Season 2 is also quite enjoyable, I preferred Season 1. Season 2 is much more blunt in it's escapades and a bit more racy than probably would have actually been for the time period. Not that it's out of line for viewing, but a bit questionable in nature at times. Excellent series.",1370649600,,287,4.433962264150943
4005964,5,B002VWOMZ4,This is a great series!!!! Great development of characters and plots. Only problem was there were only 4 seasons (last one very short) and last episode not really wrapped up on some story lines and quickly completed with others. I will definitely watch again though.,1370649600,,266,4.933333333333334

This reminds me a lot of the Walton's or Little House on the Prairie and the cast does such a phenomenal job.

4006008,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This series is such a delight.  The writing, the acting, the actors, the photography, the story line - the development of the characters and the several unique ones -  make this story superior in so many ways.  This is also a series that is family friendly without being a children's series.  How unusual is that!",1368230400,,313,4.636363636363637

4006014,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I have watched all seasons on TV and came back to watch again. These two towns are full of characters u will want to follow as they go about their many adventures. The cast is superb.
The story centers around the post office in Candleford and it's post mistress and her staff. It extends to the small town of Lark Rise and their families who are less affluent.
Each episode is a tale of their triumphs and woes.

4006017,5,B002VWOMZ4,"It as about the industrial, pre-train era during the mid 1800 in rural England.  The stories are about life in a remote and nearby hamlet and the social divide amongst an entire population of poor town folks and even poorer farm hands - all so far from 'society' or 'wealth' of any sort, it seems silly to us these days.

But the simple charm of the stories focusing on risky and scandalous behavior .... for the times, is sweet and charming.  The times when anything above the hands not covered was shocking.

Fun to sit and watch the whole series on a lazy weekend.",1368144000,,567,4.423076923076923

4006019,5,B002VWOMZ4,I chose this rating because I found this series so interesting. The characters were quirky but pulled together to help each other when needed. They weren't perfect but they dealt with their problems. It is not a high society English drama. These are working people. There are two communities. One is rural with people that work the land. The other community was a small town. This show is character driven with their interaction making the bulk of the show. I recommended this to my sister and she really liked it also.,1367712000,,519,4.714285714285714

4006025,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I'm not a big fan of TV in general, but I do love PBS. Larkrise is such a great show; pitting the warm, simple farming community of Larkrise against the growing ""metropolis"" of Candleford. I've watched Season 1 and Season 2 and am now enjoying Season 3. The show has its share of ""controversy"" and intrigue, but never compromises the overall morality portrayed in the show unlike a lot of TV nowadays. It has many redeeming qualities and the main characters are very well-developed. I love this show and it's truly become my favorite.",1367625600,,534,4.691489361702128

The series is well cast and believable acted (except when they go 'over the top' with a couple of characters). What else can I say? I am an escapist when it comes to entertainment. ""Lark Rise"" takes me away. I've watched four seasons and would view more.",1367539200,,429,4.5

The setting is in my dreams and the stories are not only precious but so decent...worthy of watching. Thomas Brown and his ""endeavors,"" Dorcas and her one weakness(es), ""Our Laura"" and her young life maturing, experiencing, the Sisters who are not twins, Queenie.. on and on, these people are my friends, and I do not want to miss what happens next between the village and the town.",1365984000,,484,4.5

4006082,3,B002VWOMZ4,"The first episode was downright creepy.

This season seemed to be all about setting up for the NEXT season.  Characters come and go.
Less time is spent in Larkrise, which was really a shame.

I'm moving on to season 3, hoping it is more like season 1.",1365897600,,251,4.297872340425532

4006085,5,B002VWOMZ4,"This wins the contest for quiant!!  Set  in a very quaint Engish village and hamlet, the competition and cooperation between Lark Rise and Candleford, as well as the on-going romantic interests, and Twister's antics (and occasional wise
advice) make this one of the best series ever!  As you watch you become involved in the village life.  My biggest concern is we have almost finished the series, and I will miss my ""one weakness"" ;-))",1365811200,,436,4.851351351351352

4006087,5,B002VWOMZ4,"LOVE this series. Same ""autobiographical"" resonance as Jane Austen or L. M. Montgomery without the modern intrusions inevitable from a contemporary adaptation of a past era. Huge fan of Downton Abbey, but Lark Rise to Candleford feels more authentic.  Addresses timeless themes such as love, gender roles, poverty, fidelity, addiction, disappointment and loyalty with tasteful thoughtfulness.  And, unless you're an aristocrat, the pressures faced by these ordinary characters seem more ""real"" than most in Downton or Pemberley.",1365811200,,528,5.8441558441558445

Great that they are in shorter segments also when you don't have time to watch a feature film. Good stuff!
My husband (who balked when I first introduced them) looks forward to them more than the kids (5 year old to teens).",1365811200,,476,4.666666666666667

4006094,4,B002VWOMZ4,This series is engaging and well acted.  The characters are well defined and believable.  Gives some incite into a small hamlet living in that era although in reality conditions must have been far worse.,1365724800,,203,4.9411764705882355

I enjoy the clear headed (most of the time) Emma, and her challenging and delightful husband Robert. Of course, the postmistress, Dorcas, keeps everyone level headed; rarely severe, she is tender, intuitive, and sensitive, showing kindness and forbearance with everyone, especially the very funny, simple, yet compilcated and quite frustrating maid.  Laura, is a lovely romantic, with intelligence and humour, giving a nice balance to the characters.  I do not really care for the full of himself- James Dowland, but that fact does not hinder my enjoyment of almost every episode; and the son that is produced at the end of the season is a wonderful addition to the series.",1365465600,,958,5.012578616352202

4006102,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I was looking for something to fill the void when this year's Downton Abbey season finished.  I absolutely love this series and cannot figure out why in the world they stopped it after only 4 seasons, and the last season was only 6 episodes.  Each main character is well developed and the acting is superb.  They are all wonderful actors.  It's a shame the U.S. can't make a series like this which is family viewing yet with such good acting and story lines that adults can't wait for the next one.",1365465600,,498,4.43956043956044

4006104,5,B002VWOMZ4,What a welcome relief from regular television programming!  Both my husband and I quickly became engrossed in the joys and challenges of the citizens of Lark Rise and Candleford. Somewhat like a British version of Little House on the Prairie.,1365465600,,242,5.05

4006108,5,B002VWOMZ4,"My husband and I love this series (and all Larkrise to Candleford series). I am not sure why we are so enamoured with these little rustic tales. Perhaps, it is because the stories are touching and poetic. The casting and acting is superb creating memorable characters.
And of course, Dorcas Lane is my one weakness.",1365379200,,315,4.745454545454545
4006109,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I became hooked on this show after watching the first season, and it continues to maintain my undivided attention. I have become so very attached to these characters and places.

4006113,4,B002VWOMZ4,"The series provides an interesting look at the intersection of a small, subsistence farming hamlet and its neighbor, a village being slowly transformed by mechanization and links to the outer world. People work hard and must solve real survival and emotional problems, but there is no blood and gore. The pace is slow--like the daily life of the characters--but letting them grow as individuals is worth the effort. There is a strong emphasis on responsibility for one another and how we develop a personal sense of values to live by. but it's not prteachy. It's an engaging soap opera dressed up in BBC's finest staging, and an escape from today's terror and angst. You'll see lots of faces from other BBC productions, including Downton Abbey.",1365033600,,744,4.96

Many times they were kick to judge by these strict moralities & principles before they had all of the facts. Lots of hearsay always came into play.
This is the prequel to today's soap operas",1364515200,,355,4.476923076923077

I've been told it doesn't hold a candle (no pun intended) to Downton Abby, so I can only imagine that I will become completely submerged in THAT show when I'm done with LRtC. This show is so engaging that I find myself thinking of the characters as I go about my normal day, as if they were people in my life. I am a busy mom and very social, so it is not as if I need fictional characters to fill my head, but they do, nevertheless.

4006143,5,B002VWOMZ4,I love to watch any period style series but this one in particular. The main character is a strong female often able to admit her mistakes or at least learns from them. The series does a good job introducing new characters often enough to keep the story fresh.,1364083200,,260,4.4375
4006144,5,B002VWOMZ4,This series is so real and beautiful.  Family dynamics and friendships studied and solved by a few townspeople. Excellent series.  Looking for more of the same!,1363910400,,160,5.115384615384615

The fabulous fashions of the Pratt sisters are a delight to see. I've just finished Season 1 and 2 and will continue with Season 3 and 4 - all on my Kindle Fire with its sharp clear pictures and great sound system.  I'm recommending this series to everyone.

4006181,4,B002VWOMZ4,"The right ingredients are all here for an entertaining television drama. Season 1 introduces the narrator, Laura who comes from a humble, country village and leaves her home there to take on a position at the Post Office in a slightly larger, more upscale country town - whose inhabitants consider themselves refined. As the episodes move forward, new characters are introduced and established members of the supporting cast fade away into untold storylines. Most of the rollicking good fun and romance, I found to be in series' 1 & 2. As with many shows, series 3 is where the writing begins to falter, but still quite watchable.",1362700800,,630,4.897196261682243

4006186,4,B002VWOMZ4,I love Jane Austen movies and Cranford. This series is really nice because there are so many episodes. I feel like I know the characters well. There are humorous characters and stereotypical characters that you can identify in your own life. A pleasant way to spend 24 hours.,1362441600,,275,4.75
4006187,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I honestly was taken away in this entire series.  I love the characters, the interactions and how well everything fits together.  Characters grow in each episode and learn new things about themselves and those around them.  There is love, and dislike and intrigue.

The story is about parts of British society that are less well represented in film or tv (the poor and middle class), and the characters are very well drawn. Set on the cusp of the modern era, the issues of change are handled with a deft hand showing the range off reactions, but even more appealing are the family relationships. Best to start with season one, though to fully understand the story.",1361491200,,559,4.384615384615385

If you're the type of person who longs for community...then this is for you.  If you're the type of person who puts yourself into the story, just out of camera's view...then this is for you.

The life lessons the show delivers are also very true and relevant today as they were in the pre Industrial and agrarian life in England. Heartbreaking, harrowing, riveting, this show will have you in a roller coaster of emotions from which you cannot escape.

Season One of Lark Rise to Candleford tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivis Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.

By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. Being a self-made and wealthy man, James settles in Candleford, though he reacquaints himself with the residents of Lark Rise, especially Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) who used to take care of him as a young boy. James opens a fashionable hotel in Candleford, and tries to 'improve' the lives of the Lark Rise residents with mixed results. There is also a strong chemistry between James and Dorcas, though their relationship flounders between attraction and rivalry/conflict. Laura seems more mature and wiser, having learned a couple of enlightening things about the pitfalls of romance, and is taking on more responsibilities at the post office. But then, a young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms, initially. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.

There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store continue to pry into others' affairs whilst dealing with their own emotional dramas. Postman Thomas Brown's (Mark Heap)romantic (mis)adventures continue, and many more. This is truly a gem of a series, and I am hopelessly addicted to it. Each episode is well-crafted and credibly acted, drawing viewers into the lives of these mostly endearing & flawed characters, and making one feel at home in both Lark Rise and Candleford.",1334275200,,3242,5.113207547169812
4006279,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I have enjoyed this series so much and sad that it can't go on forever. Dorcas, Thomas and Margaret seem like old friends.

4006281,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Season one was fantastic. And season two is also wonderful. We do get an odd Dickens-like Christmas ghost story to start the season off with (it was a special episode according to what I read on IMDB). But starting with the second episode, we get to continue the magical story telling that we've come to enjoy from this series.

Season two really focuses on individual character stories. Whereas season one had the incidents or happenings that affected the entire town (Lark Rise or Candleford or both), season two seems to focus on the back story or interactions between one or two characters or families at a time.

Alfie has definitely changed, he is not as whiny as he was in season one. Instead he is portrayed as a coming of age young man who develops a friendship with several of the older men, mainly Twister. We do focus heavily on Ms. Lane and the post office, though Laura is not as prominent a featured character. Instead she is more of the eyewitness to events and her character functions well as a narrator in this regard. Other characters are wonderfully portrayed, and it is with great delight that we view these characters grow and become fond of them.

There are a few characters that do not return from season one for various reasons. Though I do miss them, the new additions are very welcome. The gentleman that owns the new hotel is a particularly complex and enjoyable character to watch. Robert and his family do also feature quite a bit as well.

My question is: what the heck happened to Caroline Arless? Last I saw she was home with the hubby, next thing she's gone and nobody mentions why! The other characters that are not returning had story arcs that ended with the viewers knowing what happened to them.

But I think that season two really builds upon the greatness of season one and exceeds it in several cases. Just power through the haunted episode (which is just for fun) and get to the real heart of season two. Whether Lark Rise is coming together to pave a road or the towns turning out for a hotel opening or parish election; the close knit ties that bind these people together are woven into a wonderful viewing experience. Never are the story arcs too 'dramatic' or involve occurnaces that would have been out of place for the time. This is not a world of villains and sneaks and affairs. This is a world of normal people trying to make their way in rural England in the late 1800s. A world where the arrival of a bicycle causes a ruckus. A world where a woman running for a county office is unheard of. A world where just paying the rent or finding time to read a book can be a trial. It's wonderful television.

4006283,5,B002VWOMZ4,"A second set of 11 episodes (plus a Christmas special) from the BBC's delightful drama series LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD, based on the autobiographical writings of Flora Thompson.  Quality is pretty much on par with Series 1, but whereas many episodes from the first series had self-contained storylines, the plots in Series 2 tend to continue on; and while most would do this anyway, it's preferable to watch these episodes in numeric order.  As before, the writing is very strong, with lots of depth and nuance injected into the established characters, and some fantastic new faces thrown in the mix.

The four-DVD set kicks off with a special 75-minute Christmas episode, in which the residents of Lark Rise and Candleford are troubled by the presence of a barefoot young woman, with a ragged dressing-gown her only protection from the bitter chill.  The girl stirs up strong feelings from the people whom she meets, including Ruby Pratt (Victoria Hamilton), who finds the courage to stand up to her domineering sister Pearl (Matilda Ziegler); and Caroline (Dawn French), who fears that her husband is preparing to return to the sea.  Laura finds her loyalties torn when she is expected to go back to her family in Lark Rise for Christmas, leaving Dorcas (Julia Sawalha) to spend the festivities alone.

Series 2 officially kicks off with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former orphan from Lark Rise who has returned to open the Golden Lion Hotel in Candleford - and to no doubt also help usher in a new era of change.  Dorcas and James strike up a competitive relationship as they vie for a position on the local council.  Meanwhile, headaches at the post office are caused by Dorcas' new maid Minnie (Ruby Bentall), a young girl whose flippant attitude to performing her work is matched only by her foolhardy personality - but who also carries a terrifying secret.

Laura is intrigued by Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty), a clockmaker who has been engaged by James to create a clock tower for Candleford, whilst postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) woos Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade) in his own hilarious fashion.  After taking over the care of the latest Timmins baby for a few weeks in order to give exhausted Emma (Claudie Blakley) a small respite from her duties, Dorcas and Ruby both ponder their futures as childless spinsters.  A cruel reversal of fortunes in the Timmins household later threatens to split the family apart altogether when Robert (Brendan Coyle) considers leaving the district to find work.

When Dorcas falls ill with a severe 'flu, it's left to Laura to keep the post office running as smoothly as ever, but with a sleepwalking Thomas and a sudden string of abusive, taunting letters addressed to ""The Girl at the Post Office"", Laura's new position of authority doesn't come without it's obstacles.  Long-simmering tensions between Lark Rise and its neighbouring hamlet Fordlow run riot when Alf (John Dagleish) starts courting Nan Carter (Rebecca Night).  James' past, in the form of a beautiful older woman (Samantha Bond), comes back to haunt him; and in the days leading up to Thomas and Margaret's wedding, James and Dorcas once again find themselves at odds, this time concerning the welfare of a bespectacled, ten-year-old boy named Sydney...

4006285,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I bought season two and three in blu-ray and tried to play in my Sony BDP-S360 but they would not. I updated the firmware and still no luck. I went to Best Buy today (8 January 2012) and took Season 2 along and tried the newest Sony 3D blu-ray BDPBX58 and they still wouldn't play. The salesman and I then tried the LG BD670 and the discs played perfectly! I bought the player, took it home, and we just watched an episode and some extras and all went beautifully.
Now for the series: we were introduced to Lark Rise by our Australian friends (she is originally from the UK) and we were hooked after the first episode. To make you appreciate where we're coming from, I have to tell you the following background information: we have a gigantic video collection with all kinds of classic films and TV series. We have five boys and a girl ranging from seven to 22 years and we've always watched everything as a family, and before Lark Rise we would have told you that some of our favorite movie and tv productions were Lord of the Rings, Amadeus, the original Twilight Zone, classic Star Trek, Alfred Hitchcock movies, etc. We are all in complete agreement that Lark Rise is the most riveting, well-written, best-cast series ever shown on television. The acting is superb - just flawless - and you feel as if you're living with the characters as they draw out every emotion from you.  Unlike Little House on the Prairie, which was so predictable that you could map out each episode about a minute after it started, the Lark Rise writers have you literally sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation (and worry) of what will happen next. We've been taken by complete surprise about a dozen times already.  We are all dreading the end of season four as we wish that this series would have went on forever.",1325980800,,1806,4.503048780487805

Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.

By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. Being a self-made and wealthy man, James settles in Candleford, though he reacquaints himself with the residents of Lark Rise, especially Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) who used to take care of him as a young boy. James opens a fashionable hotel in Candleford, and tries to 'improve' the lives of the Lark Rise residents with mixed results. There is also a strong chemistry between James and Dorcas, though their relationship flounders between attraction and rivalry/conflict. Laura seems more mature and wiser, having learned a couple of enlightening things about the pitfalls of romance, and is taking on more responsibilities at the post office. But then, a young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he initially seems oblivious to her charms. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.

There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store continue to pry into others' affairs whilst dealing with their own emotional dramas. Postman Thomas Brown's (Mark Heap)romantic (mis)adventures continue, and many more. This is truly a wonderful period drama. Each episode is well-crafted and credibly acted, drawing viewers into the lives of these mostly endearing & flawed characters, and making one feel at home in both Lark Rise and Candleford.",1324166400,,2971,5.239495798319328

Season two (2) on four (4) discs again presents gentle non-violent stories about a bunch of very amiable folks that live in the very beautiful, picturesque and idealist villages of Lark Rise and Candleford in the early 1800s.  Through the eyes of Laura Timmins we get to view some gentle happenings to some intriguing country folks in Larks Rise and to some more ""citified"" folks in Candleford through the ""happenings"" at the post office.  These ""happenings"" involve class prejudices, love, family loyalties, jealousies, ghosts, problems of growing up along with the problems of growing old, stewardship, the work ethic, etc.  All of the stories in this season two (2) are so well told without any violence or mayhem that one is able to just sit-back and get involved in the lives of some nice people.",1306108800,,993,4.892857142857143

My wife thoroughly enjoy the great story, the many well developed characters, and the truely professional presentation.  One is transported mentally, as an observer, to a very interesting and, in some ways, fun and much less hectic life of an English country village, Lark Rise, and it supporting country town, Candleford.

There are new and old characters that will continue/begin to melt your heart. I do miss Sir Timothy, and Lady Adelaide,but am grateful the Pratt sisters are back. They are like the Baldwin sisters,of the Waltons series, from the 70's. Highly amusing.

4006316,5,B002VWOMZ4,"My wife, 11-year old daughter, mother-in-law, and I are hooked on BBC's ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" TV series.  During season 1 we got to know the characters that live in the out village of Lark Rise, as well as the prominent citizens of the larger market town, Candleford.  The setting stays the same in season 2, where we get to follow the lives of our friends from season 1 as they continue to toil and make their way in rural 1895 England.

This is outstanding family entertainment, with something for everyone, though it will probably not hold the attention of the children in grades 1-3 or so in elementary school.  It, frankly, doesn't sell too well with my HS son either.  Regardless, this is a great series, and if you haven't yet tried it, I heartily encourage you to do so.

This show is entirely watchable.  There has been nothing in the first two seasons that I have been hesistant about either my 11-year old daughter or mother-in-law seeing.  Get the picture?  Though I have to admit that episode 1 in season 2 was a bit freaky, with everyone seeing the ghost(?) of a girl, and then trying to figure out what that means.  Anyway, the people were still clearly largely superstitious, and comes across here and there.

The stories are engaging, and the acting is top-notch.  I like the characters, the setting of the story, and the way you get to know the characters in this series.

I'm adding this to my review after having watched the series again.  On second watching I found that aside from the Christmas Special (which did have one piece of main plot line in that Alf's dad decides to stay with his family rather than go back to sea), only the last 2 episodes really started to fall off quality-wise.

These well-crafted episodes based on Flora Thompson's book present an interesting mix of interpersonal relationships and the impact of changes and social issues in town and village on their residents. But another aspect of these discs' content earns an unfavorable review -- the frustrating user experience with the BBC introductory material and the menu. It is impossible to play the episodes in Set 2 one at a time (stopping the DVD between episodes) without having to sit through the front-end commercials and annoyingly prolonged copyright warning on every occasion. These discs do not allow the viewer to fast-forward through or skip this material --or at least I haven't yet found a way. I remember the episode selection menu in Set 1 being much more straightforward and user-friendly.

4006328,4,B002VWOMZ4,"Overall I enjoyed the second season of this series. But I thought the Christmas episode was hokey. I also feel that the addition of certain characters, such as an illegitimate son of Dowland (?) shows a certain desperation in trying to keep the series going.",1275782400,3,258,4.7555555555555555
4006329,5,B002VWOMZ4,Season two did not disappoint in any way---it was as entertaining as season one.  I enjoyed both of them immensely and look forward to season three.  I understand this series was very popular and well received in the UK and I'm sure season three will follow.......I look forward to it.,1275609600,,285,4.68
4006330,5,B002VWOMZ4,"My husband & I are addicted to this series.  We've seen season 1 and couldn't wait to buy season 2.  These are clean, uplifting and the acting is outstanding.  We watch an episode every few nights as a reward at the end of a long day.",1274659200,,234,4.043478260869565
4006331,5,B002VWOMZ4,"My husband and I just love this series!  It is clean, witty entertainment that leaves you feeling good.  It is so refreshing to watch compared with so many other movies and shows these days that leave you feeling like you have just wasted your time.",1274140800,,249,4.511111111111111
4006332,3,B002VWOMZ4,"Some heavy weight British talent on this series I had hoped for a bit more depth. Too much of a ""Feel Good"" series. Not a bad show but a combination of Jane Austen meets Laura Ingalls Wilder with
a touch of Father Murphy and Doctor Quinn added.
Actress Claudie Blakley, daughter of musician Alan Blakley, has one of the lead roles and she's wasting her talent on what is not much more than a ""soap"" in period costume.
Season One was just too predictable and the best episode was one in which the fine British actor, Phil Davis guested.

Not bad for light weight entertainment just don't expect shades of Dickens or Austen.",1273363200,3,622,4.504424778761062
4006333,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Well done series making you excited about season 3. My mom is British and really enjoys theses pieces about old England, small villages and the like. We have a mom daughter get together to watch this series and do lunch. I recently discovered season 3 had been on KPBS. Can't wait till season 3 available.",1272585600,,305,4.5636363636363635
4006334,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I stumbled across the first season of Lark Rise to Candleford while hunting something else and discovered one of the most amazing and enjoyable series, I've seen. I was delighted to find a second season and would love to see a third season. It is easy to forget the actors are acting. The attention to detail makes the setting so real it would be easy to go there.  The change coming upon rural England, the daily lives, the courage, humor, joys, and sorrows come to life in these beautiful episodes and amazing characters. This is in the finest tradition of BBC period pieces, The Pallisers, the Jane Austen novels, and Elizabeth Gaskill.",1272240000,,639,4.705357142857143
4006335,5,B002VWOMZ4,"There is something about this series that is so wonderful to watch. Is it a time gone by, when people took their time to do and see others in their lives? Poor people who are happy just being together, something you can not buy. Yes i believe i've become addicted to watching this and will await for the 3rd series to be released. I enjoy all the characters at Lark Rise and candleford equally.
I recommend viewing this series.",1269993600,2,427,4.417721518987341
4006336,5,B002VWOMZ4,"I love what the writers have done to the books by Flora Thompson!  They have created characters to inhabit the county that Flora described.  Almost all of the people are either new or if named in the books, they have been given different personas.  The storylines have been wonderful, full of twists and turns and thoughly enjoyable.  I recommend watching the series on DVD.",1269475200,,374,4.796875

4006338,5,B002VWOMZ4,"My wife and I recently performed a general evaluation of all the movies or television shows we've watched in our 4 years together, and it is our feeling that the Lark Rise to Candleford series has given us about half of our favorite ""movie moments,"" as we like to call them. We cherish our late-night opportunities to catch an episode and relish some of the best acting modern film has to offer (Twister is masterfully acted). If you LOVE some of the incredible moments delivered by Pride & Pejudice (Ehle, Firth) or the latest Sense & Sensibility, or some of the character driven intricacies of plot from Anne of Green Gables and Cranford, you will LOVE Lark Rise to Candleford. Buy seasons 1 & 2 for yourself today, or if you want, you can borrow ours. Everybody else is!!!",1269043200,4,775,4.58273381294964
4006339,5,B002VWOMZ4,"As I said in the title, it is an entertaining, engaging, well-acted period drama. We are partial to shows of this type (the kind of thing that you would see on Masterpiece theatre) especially British productions. The characters are likable, the acting is good and the scenery is appealing. Despite being set in the late Victorian period in rural Oxfordshire, much of the heart of the experiences and emotions of the characters are still relevant and you are always left wanting to know what will happen next. I like the fact that the cast aren't all ""big names"" and familiar faces(except perhaps for Julia Sawalha whom I enjoy watching anyway).

It's also an interesting study of the era and a ""place"" that no longer exists - as were the books on which the series was based.

The Christmas special episode was a bit naff and out of character for the overall series, so don't let that put you off (but then again Christmas episodes often are a disappointment).

Looking forward to Series 3 being released next year.",1268611200,2,1014,4.7175141242937855
4006340,5,B002VWOMZ4,"My entire family loves this series from BBC.  It reminds me of a much more sophisticated Little House on the Prairie. In fact, the more I think about it, it has a lot in common with that series.  We would recommend this to anyone.  In fact, my wife won't even lend it out because she is watching it again.",1268611200,,305,4.135593220338983
4006341,5,B002VWOMZ4,"Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season Two is wonderful.  Most of the familiar, lovable characters from season one return.  The season two series does, however, suffer a problem season one suffered -- it ends far too soon.  LRTC proves that quality entertainment can be achieved without resulting to the vulgar, mundane, or tasteless.  You laugh, you cry, you become totally wrapped up in each of the characters from Lark Rise and Chandleford. It's Victorian with a flair for real-life relationships that are as true today as in the 1800's.  No detail is left undone: scenery, props, costumes, characterizations.  I can hardly wait for season three to make it to DVD.",1268352000,2,673,5.018018018018018

MOST VIEWERS WILL NOTE THAT TIME AND SCENE SHIFTS IN THIS PROGRAM ARE BIZARRE!  OTHER TIMES, PLOTS SEEM TO DEVELOP TOO FAST OR LEAVE YOU WONDERING IF YOU'VE MISSED SOMETHING.  YOU DID.  AS IN OTHER BBC / PBS SHOWS, THESE EPISODES ARE TRUNCATED DOWN TO FIT SOME SORT OF TIME LIMIT.  THEY DID SAME THING WITH DOWNTOWN ABBEY.",1514073600,,436,4.6103896103896105

8382560,4,B002VWOMZ4,"Many, many of the episodes presented here on Amazon Prime are missing relevant scenes that appeared in the original PBS telecasts. To name just one example: at least THREE SCENES are missing from a single episode, Season 2, Episode 5: A scene in which Alf and Robert Timmins sit in a pub discussing Minnie's claim of ""being ruined,"" a scene in which Robert Timmins offers James Dowland some of his personal advice on courting Dorcas Lane, and a third scene in which Emma Timmins talks to Robert about their son's having made a map. I have found many disappointing omissions on other episodes in the series presented here as well, as anyone who has seen the original PBS telecasts will attest. WHAT'S GOING ON, AMAZON? There is no reason to shorten the episodes here. I'm sure there must be a profit motive involved somewhere, but it's not in the best interests of the viewers here. I have also noticed missing scenes from other series presented here, such as NYPD Blue.",1498176000,,969,4.705882352941177
8382561,5,B002VWOMZ4,I loved the series.  It was so well written and so well acted!  Takes you back to a time when communities cared for each other and stuck together.

It is something I look forward to all day.  Very sweet stories with very wise characters.  Good even for children or pre-teens and teens to watch.  I am reading the book, also, and the portrayals and the way of life seem accurate.  I love this show!",1487116800,,406,4.346666666666667
