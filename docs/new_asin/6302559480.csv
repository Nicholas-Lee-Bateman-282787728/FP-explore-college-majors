Although the lenght of the program is too short, it's worth every penny.  Fun, great music, camaraderie amongst them, mistake-free execution of each song, great response from the audience, old Ted being old Ted, and more.

479961,5,6302559480,"The Damn Yankees band, was formed back in 1990 by Jack Blades (former NIGHT RANGER)on bass, Tommy Shaw (former STYX) on rhythm guitar, Ted Nugent on lead guitar, and the relatively unknown Michael Cartellone on drums. Achiving since the beginning an explosive chemistry. Then, the band recorded the first studio album called simply DAMN YANKEES (1990). Featuring great Rock and Pop songs like ""Coming Of Age"", ""Come again"" and the power ballad ""High Enough"" where the ethereal choruses, the emotional melody and the powerfull guitar chords and voices just make one thinks: What a great american band we have here!... Afterwards in 1991 appeared in the market the VHS Damn Yankees with live unplugged and studio videos from the first album. In 1992 the second and last album: DON'T TREAD, were the answer to all the market expectatives with songs as ""Don't Tread On Me"", ""Fifteen Minutes Of Fame"" and another great ballad ""Where You Going Now"", that kept the same group level of creativity and quality.

UPRISING is a DVD where you can be the eyewitness and feel the driving levels of firy intensity and musicality with interpretations of the best songs of the band plus tracks of STYX (""Renegade""), Night Ranger (""You Can Still, Rock In America) and Ted Nugent solo career (""Cat Scrash Fever""). Really a great concert of a great american band, full of scenes of band's comentaries having fun! a good purchase if you like the madness of four guys that play Hard melodic Rock!.... Good Luck!",1176768000,17,1489,4.908730158730159
479962,5,6302559480,"Filmed at a concer in denver in about 1992, this video show a highly overlooked supergroup of the past, who at the time were a the top of the power pop hard rock scene.  Consisting of Tommy Shaw of Styx, Ted Nugent, Jack Blades of Night Ranger, and Michael Cartellone, this band just clicked. The set list includes Damn Yankees, Uprising, High Enough, Don't Tread On Me,  Where You Going Now, Fifteen Minutes Of Fame, Come Again, Coming Of Age, Renegade (Styx), Cat Scratch Fever (Nugent), and Rock In America (Night Ranger).  The behind the scenes footage is as fun as the energetic stage show, and shows how well a bunch of big personalities can just make things flow together into good work.  A mix of power, ballads, souther twang, and you get the Damn Yankees.

This DVD does not have any extras, or special features, videos ect..., but it does not need them, because what is here is pure gold. Sure it would have been nice to see the old videos from MTV, but this is just right as it is.  Get this video for a supergroup that did live up to their expectations.",1173744000,26,1066,4.441025641025641

480071,5,6302559480,"I buy the value DVD's because every now and then, you find a nugget.... This one was a nugget!

Great DVD... Camera work was good, sound was good, Ted was excellent... Whatever you may musically think of Ted, forget all his solo work. This is NOTHING like Great White Buffalo, Stranglehold or Cat Scratch.

I say as a good guitarist myself, Ted brings game to this DVD that I've never heard Ted play!

With Tommy and Jack there's a few sappy ballads but the majority of the songs are rockers.

This DVD contains was seems to be becoming the norm with small interviews between every so many songs. Half of these 60 second interviews are just the guys being either silly or mainly self-gratifying. Then the other half is Ted demonstrating his skill of confidence and the bow and arrow.

Anyway, it's simply good ol' rock 'n roll.... Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.

Great for a Saturday night on the couch with cold beverage in hand and the surround system cranked!

Enjoy....",1359158400,,981,4.603448275862069

480073,5,6302559480,"I had this one on VHS back in the day and then the world changed and so did the formats. I've always loved this band but one of the greatest complaints about my VHS tape was that the sound mix was terrible and I could barely hear Ted Nugent's guitar so when the song would play and it was time for the Nugemeister's solo, I had that reaction that basically goes ""Huh??"". Well that problem has been fixed and I feel like I'm watching this concert filmed in CO for the first time again. The mix is great so you can hear ALL the guitars and since I'm watching this on a blu-ray player, the DVD looks outstanding. Another great thing about this concert is that after each song they show a little behind the scene stuff and you can tell that these guys had a real camaraderie. At the end they play Renegade by Styx, Cat Scratch Fever by Uncle Ted, and (You Can Still)Rock In America by Night Ranger and that last performance is a real treat since the original version has keyboards and there were no keys in this one so it sounds a little different but fun! The most incredible thing about this DVD was the price! Basically $5 for musicianship of this caliber with Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades, and Ted Nugent??? Are you kidding?? Michael Cartellone was a great drummer too! Anybody that enjoys classic or 80's rock should enjoy this.",1345075200,,1324,4.3861788617886175

480075,1,6302559480,The insert for this DVD was not properly aligned behind the plastic so when the security sticker was placed on it was stuck to the insert.

480077,5,6302559480,The band sounded great (I think the person who said it didn't must not have a very good sound system on their TV - the DVD sounds better than the CD).  Ted and Jack are so full of energy and really performing their butts off.  Tommy is a bit stoic until the end but his voice is great and his guitar playing on different guitars is phenomenal.  This band rocks.  The interviews are fun but it is nice to have the option of just listening to the concert.  The DVD was well worth the price and I've a better appreciation for the second album.  Very few bands sound great live to me - the voices are not the same - a few missed notes lets you know these guys are not playing the studio cuts and just running around and having a lot of fun.

You get Ted Nugent, Tommy Shaw (of Styx, also, he is from Alabama), A great bass player (I'm not sure of his name, but he was from ""Night Ranger"" I think - anyway, he's a pro), and Michael Cartellone (from Cleveland on drums - He is now with Lynyrd Skynyrd and has been for about 10 years or so). This ""super-group"" was really popular in the early 1990's.

This is an excellent concert dvd, with interviews of the band members. You get the songs:
Damn Yankees
Uprising
High Enough
Where You Goin' Now
Fifteen Minutes of Fame
Don't Tread on Me
Come Again
Coming of Age
Renegade (a Styx song)
Cat Scratch Fever (a Ted Nugent song)

480115,5,6302559480,"I have been a DY fan since they came out, and never got a chance to see em live. This is one damn fine performace on this dvd. The mix is in 5.1 Dolby which sounds amazing. I love everything about this dvd except a few minor things, which I'll get into.

DVD Chapters-The way this works really is kind of annoying. What I mean by this is they play a song or two, and then they have interview clips in between all the songs. It has a PLAY ALL feature, where it plays the whole dvd from start to finish, and it has another feature which is PERFORMANCES ONLY, where they cut out all the interviews, and they were really sloppy with the chapters. It cuts out a second or two of the concert, and doesn't start right where the interview ends. When it skips all the interviews, there's no fading out, or nothing, it's just real sloppy, it just jumps to them playing.

SETLIST-I was kind of disappointed that Silence Is Broken wasn't included in the live set, and that none of the music videos were included as extras. I have Dokken's Unchain The Night video collection, and has bonus interviews and videos as extras, and was done really well, which was also released by Rhino. 2 tracks I don't really care for on this dvd release is the title track Uprising, and 15 Minutes Of Fame. I would have replaced these 2 songs with Silence Is Broken, and Dirty Dog, which are 2 way better songs. I think the 2 songs they chose were Ted's choice, because Uprising is the only song that he sings, besides Cat Scratch Fever.

Onto the good things about this dvd though, I really thought these guys nail it live. The 5.1 Dolby sounds great, and is nice and loud. When you watch this video, you can't help but have fun because, you can clearly see that the band has fun playing together. There's nothing I hate more than seeing a band perform live, and it looks like they're just trying to get through it without killing each other. For instance, when Tommy Shaw starts the intro to COME AGAIN, he hears Ted do a lead over top of it, and says TED, CAN YOU DO THAT AGAIN? and he starts it over, and after he plays a bit of a solo, he says THANK YOU, GOODNIGHT!...THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME MAN!, you can tell that they have a good sense of humour on stage.

Another thing that's a nice touch is they do 3 covers at the end of the show for an encore. Tommy sings Styx's Renegade, Ted sings Cat Scratch Fever, and Jack sings Night Ranger's Rock In America. The backstage interviews are great, and a lot of fun, but I just wish they would have been included separate, like in a bonus feature kind of section on the dvd, instead of playing between the songs. Other than that, I give this dvd a 5 out of 5. It's that good! I watch it over and over, and have fun watching it every time. Only thing that would make this dvd perfect is if all the videos were included, and Silence Is Broken was included in the live performances. Dirty Dog would have been nice, but wasn't a single, so it don't really matter.

I just love this dvd more than any music dvd I own. I've probably watched this sucker like 100 times so far. And I don't even think I've owned it for a year yet. So for any Damn Yankees fans, or just fans of Hair Metal, 80's Hard Rock, or even just classic guitar rock, you'll love this dvd. This dvd went above and beyond in video and sound quality.

Whatever became of Damn Yankees?  If you're wondering what all the hype was about, it wasn't hype.  DY was the real thang.

Directed by Larry Jordan, who's also done concert videos for Rush, the live concert film is interspersed with ""behind the scenes"" footage of this supergroup collaborating on their second album ""Don't Tread.""

480118,2,6302559480,"I must admit up front that I am a life long Tommy Shaw fan and as such I had strong reservations about the pairing of Tommy and Ted Nugent before the band even had a name.

This video is flacid. The song selection is terribly lacking as very few of their best works are featured here. MYSTIFIED, DOUBLE COYOTE and others should have been included instead of the solo material. Of particular note is how Terrible Ted steals the lead guitar solo for RENEGADE from the author himself, Tommy Shaw.

The MTV style filming is embarrassing (though Tommy is more chagrined by his recollection of wearing DOC MARTIN boots) and the music itself is shallow and staid. Never do the boys really stretch out and showcase their incredible talents (except for guitar solos by Ted.)

I saw the band in concert on several occasions. This DVD is little more than a reminder of what a DAMN YANKEES concert was like back in the early 90's.",1190419200,,918,4.551515151515152
480119,5,6302559480,"Thank God this performance was captured on film and finally released.  If you like good ole' rock & roll, you will love this DVD.  It is my absolute favorite.  No need to add anything more except buy this as soon as possible.  You will be glad you did.",1188172800,,252,4.1875
480130,3,6302559480,"I purchased this DVD with the intention of visiting a band that I never got to see live back in the good ol days, do their thing for their appreciative audience. It was a little disappointing. I have yet to make it all the way through the DVD at one sitting. Individually, I like all three of the main guys in the band, Jack Blades, Tommy Shaw, and Ted Nugent. And a couple of their hits were pretty good. But there just isn't that much to recommend this DVD. Its all pretty average. Its also annoying to have the interview and ""band hanging out"" segments sandwiched between the songs in the concert. So I would recommend this to the diehard Damn Yankee fan but everyone else would probably be happier just renting it once or looking for clips on the internet.",1185753600,3,760,4.397163120567376
480131,5,6302559480,I enjoyed watching this DVD.  It is a classic piece with original band members.,1184976000,2,79,4.642857142857143
480132,5,6302559480,This dvd is truly better than I expected it to be.  The individual performances by the band members and the overall sound quality was exceptional. I am an avid dvd music fan and collector.  This one is now one of my favorites.  This is a must get for Ted Nugent and Tommy Shaw fans.  The other 2 band members are very good as well.... enjoy!!,1181520000,2,342,4.2153846153846155

480136,4,6302559480,"I enjoy this one.  Music and video quality are good.  Performance is great. Very energetic, and Ted is at his best.  Interviews add an interesting side.  Worth the purchase.",1179619200,2,173,4.862068965517241
480137,5,6302559480,The perfect combination of performances and outtakes. The music is a jam and there is plenty of humor too.,1178928000,,106,4.631578947368421
480138,4,6302559480,"Now this lot I have always adored since their debut CD. They combine talents of some of the best bands of their genres from the 80s in the form of Ted Nugent, Jack 'Night Ranger' Blades and Tommy 'Styx"" Shaw. Damn Yankees are a slicker paired down version of all those bands and are truly a supergroup. Take out the pomp of it all and just go for blues-soaked heavy rock of the heartland. All their big hits are on here including ""High Enough"", ""Where you Goin' Now"" and ""Coming of Age"". As would expect with such an outing you get some stuff for their pasts as well. The band banter in between the tracks shows a bit into how this lot of giant talents manage to produce anything without killing each other. There is even a bit of insight into how they manage those close harmonies. This was originally released in '92 on VHS and the DVD version suffers from none of the bad conversion problems that happens so often when using archive material.

One can always hope that the Damn Yankee machine will come back, especially with Blades and Shaw working together again. Until that happens this is a fitting testament to a cracking rock supergroup. Great stuff and well worth the price of admission",1178928000,2,1195,4.506912442396313
480139,5,6302559480,"Damn Yankees brought a rare mix of rock and roll styles into one band. The sound was fun and translated to a great live show. I saw them co-head line with Bad Company in San Jose, CA and they flat out had a great show. This DVD does a great job of capturing the essence of what was Damn Yankees. If you missed them, here is a chance to get caught up, if you are a fan, this needs to be in your collection. They had too short a run, but made great rock and roll.
