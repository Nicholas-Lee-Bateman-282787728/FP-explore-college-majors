4986415,4,B003TFERAM,"Minus one star for tobacco scenes.
  Excellent script writing, excellent casting, excellent acting, excellent sets and costuming, excellent direction and filming. EXCELLENT movie with highly intriguing, charismatic characters in a multi-layered, twisty, changing spy plot. The acting is superlative.
  This is a period piece set in what seems around the mid 1950's cold war era. Just when you think you've got it figured, it twists...and twists... and twists some more. I can't stress enough how well the acting is, and how nostalgic the 50's atmosphere is. This is an astonishingly good movie. Too bad about the cigarettes, or I would rated this top notch movie making.",1481414400,,670,5.2924528301886795

4986420,5,B003TFERAM,"a beautiful wet cinema photograph work, a true and touch story of a good teacher and her students. No any actor and actress involved, but it is a feature not a documentary. it is a good movie to watch and understand the china countryside education status. you will feel the strong connections with the teacher and those kids who try all the way to get their education non-stopping. Great for children to watch, and understand how lucky they are in western countries.
English subtitle is well done, suit well for those  who need practice the chinese language, because the  film's dialog is simple and slow",1294099200,,604,4.742857142857143
4986431,4,B003TFERAM,"I've giving this movie 4-1/2 stars, and the half star off is for the crummy Amazon description. If I didn't have a background in the history of Communism and the tactics of the various leftist spy states, I'd never have known nor appreciated the detail of this movie, and what it means. If you don't know history, you sure wouldn't know that the time and place of this movie is extremely important to understanding it. It takes place the year after the Hungarian Revolution in 1957 (just google Hungarian Revolution if you aren't aware of what happened.)

This isn't just a spy movie. It's a detailed inside look of how the Communist state operated, and the havoc it played with families and relationships, and what it did to individuals who served the state.

It really is excellent, and I highly recommend it. I also recommend that Amazon hire people who aren't historical illiterates when they write the descriptions of what these movies are actually about!",1490486400,7,960,4.8121212121212125

4986469,5,B003TFERAM,"I was surprised by how The Exam drew me in right away. Taking place on the day before Christmas with most action taking place on one street and in two apartments, it is a measured study of deception and paranoia that questions patriotism and personal trust. Jung, a young teacher, is also a government agent who has various citizens reporting to him, telling him what happened and who was there and was there any subversive activity. He in turn must report to others. Loyalty to the Communist party must be upheld and every citizen is suspect. Surveillance is rife and one can never be sure if someone -- a friend, a teacher, a lover -- is what they claim to be. Every citizen will be tested for loyalty -- and they will not know when this exam is being given. I don't want to give away plot lines or twists, but suffice it to say that, yes, we learn very early in the movie that Jung is being tested, but there is more going on than we perceive. The ending was jolting. Superb movie with great acting and suspense throughout.",1485388800,4,1026,4.405263157894737

4986488,5,B003TFERAM,"Despiter the awful English translation of the title (should be 'The Test'), this kafkaesque film about the Hungarian Communist bureaucracy in the 50's builds from a slow boil to a powerful conclusion. Although the end is predictable about half-way through and its hard to tell one set of spies from another, that turns out to the point. Because any note of empathy or kindness is punished as 'failure' and the scenes are uniformly drab, the whole has the feel of a sci fi tragedy with peaks at humanity. Hard to find a more biting critique of the Soviet system or, frankly, of Hungarian capitulation.  'Deadpool' would be a good subtitle.  .",1484870400,,641,4.7657657657657655

4986491,4,B003TFERAM,"Pretty grim as expected communist living.  This film examines the deep seated mistrust and lack of humanity all in the name of a political dogma, while pointing out the cold fact that communism regardless of what is espoused by the Bernie Sanders of the world, consists of the have and the have not's, those with power to do with what they wish to those who have none.",1484697600,,368,4.492537313432836
4986492,5,B003TFERAM,"A very well made film to see what living in a truly repressive society is, something that very few in the west today will ever understand. Based on the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 it's a time and place where party affiliation meant everything. Where you lived, worked, the availability of food, any leisure activities, everything was based on your position in the party. To be excluded from the party literally meant a life of misery and a slow death, not only for yourself, but those you cared for. This film shows you the world where everyone was watching everyone else for that one slip up. Having a progressive thought or a liberal view meant at best prison as an enemy of the people, or just eliminated as a traitor. I wish Hollywood would produce accurate historical drama's such as this instead of their feel good, PC drivel that is their common fodder.",1484611200,9,861,4.671052631578948
4986493,4,B003TFERAM,"Could have been a stage play, the action was confined to a few rooms for the most part.  Taken together with the austere settings, the knotty complexity of plot and premise focuses the audience' attention on content, context and character.  Who was testing whom?  In these respects, resembles a Le Carre tale. It's one of those flicks that are worth a second viewing to see if there were missed hints prefiguring the conclusion.  As at least one comment has noted, knowing the full historic context will help the viewer understand the action.  I was alive at the time of the Hungarian uprising ( though not in Hungary ) and remember the broad outline of the event.  Probably a Wikipedia entry would suffice, so don't complain about the apparent obscurity of the context.  Look it up.",1484438400,8,783,4.7555555555555555

There aren't many first-rate movies about the realities of socialist Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, but this is one of them.  The Exam has at its core the application of Stalinist principles following the failed 1956 revolution in which the ideal socialist man is supposed to divorce his emotions--his every humanness--from his work in uncovering wreckers, traitors, class enemies, etc.  In other words, when socialism fails (and it always does), the socialists blame their failed system on imaginary sabotage at the cost of family and friends.

The reality of the lives people led during those times and in those places were much more brutal and fatal, but this film captures brilliantly the highly charged atmosphere that permeated everything and everyone. Hard to express how well done this film is. Great suspense, which is a tribute to the actors themselves and secondarily how they are directed and filmed. At some points I literally stopped breathing in anticipation of what would happen next. The best suspense is always relationship driven. Will become one of the great films regarding the cold war era. And again, the acting in this film by the entire cast, but especially the leads is fantastic.
One very minor issue, that of the title and end credit music. Satire doesn't come across well usually and especially since the story and film itself were not at all satire but actually very serious. The music for both were just poor choices. I understand the director's intent but geez a major lost opportunity.

4986592,4,B003TFERAM,"Movie that explores a forgotten chapter of history, life in a Marxist-socialist workers paradise.  Takes place in Hungary a year after the Hungarian revolt against Russia was crushed in Budapest's streets.  Movie follows State Security Police ""testing"" the loyalty of one of their own. Lots of paranoid goings on, and mysterious character and personal interactions.  Hungarian language with English subtitles",1482364800,4,408,5.766666666666667
4986593,5,B003TFERAM,"A very good movie about how the secret service workers used to do their job and advance in powerful positions during communism. People coming from ""the eastern block"" will remember exactly how this was happening in their countries at that time. At least they were letting the Hungarians celebrate Christmas but in Romania under Ceausescu's era the Christmas celebration was pushed to the 29th of December and was called completely different.",1482278400,9,441,5.225352112676056

4986595,5,B003TFERAM,"Before watching, I recommend a refresher in history, starting with The Hungarian Revolution of 1956.  The movie aims to depict how life was experienced under Communist rule in Hungary, when fealty to the Party invaded and poisoned all basic human relationships.  The Communists killed off interpersonal trust and replaced it with paranoia, in much the same was as is depicted in Solzhenitsyn's nonfiction books. The movie resonates all the more because it was produced entirely in Hungary, which suffered two humiliating defeats (initial invasion; and crushing of the counter-Revolution) under the brutal hand of the Soviets.  It is heartfelt and rings true to life.",1482105600,46,666,5.384615384615385

4986597,5,B003TFERAM,"Well worth your attention and your time.  It all takes place on a single evening within a very small cast of characters, but effectively pulls the plot inexorably toward its inescapable conclusion... when at last you realize that you have been played.",1481932800,13,251,4.976190476190476

4986599,3,B003TFERAM,"Never have I felt the weight of totalitarian mind control so personally. Did the characters ever see the sun? If the scenery is noirish, the plot is engaging. Not to be taken too seriously. But a couple of well spent hours observing evil in comfort and safety.",1481846400,,260,4.553191489361702
4986600,5,B003TFERAM,"Not action packed , but the drama was good, and it wasn't too long or slow moving.  A communist spy in training is tested to see if he is ready for service. The place reminds me of older small country towns in East Germany or even Tennessee.",1481846400,,241,4.127659574468085

Yeah. Sure. I'll finish it. I'll even add one star to this review for each complete English sentence I hear, up to the max of 5.

Really getting tired of selecting highly rated movies that allegedly have English audio, then discovering that the only English is subtitles. Pretty sure this issue is Amazon specific.",1528416000,,541,4.858695652173913

8497619,4,B003TFERAM,"Very good movie. The photography is reminiscent of ""The Spy Who Came in From The Cold."" It had a very bleak appeal throughout, and the audience could feel the oppression of human spirit. Only those who lived in a surveillance state could fully appreciate how much of the joyless, soulless scenario was correct. The story is very intelligent and direction as well as acting were great as well. One can tell that the actors were all in kind of classically trained. Good show, a bit slower than standard pace of current commercial movies.",1507420800,,535,4.763440860215054

8497621,3,B003TFERAM,The picture was 16:9 and the audio wasn't 5.1 surround. Since I didn't understand the language I read the whole movie. I thought that maybe a small part of the first part was in another language for authenticity but I was wrong. I will not be reading anymore movies. This should have been presented as a comic book. When the words were presented to fast for my reading I just let it go; I didn't back it up. I still got the whole story.,1498262400,,436,4.2023809523809526
8497622,5,B003TFERAM,"Grew up under the Communist regime in neighboring Romania, and even though I was not born when the Hungarian Revolution took place I learned about it from my father, from Radio Free Europe, who years later were still talking about it. I even learned about it from the communist regime in Romania, although the spin they were giving was totally predictable ""Imperialists elements (aka NATO allies) were trying to interfere with the popular will, and our great friends from the East (read USSR) had to come to the rescue"".  So I can relate to the plot and how the secret police operated in the Eastern block.  Nobody trusted anybody, sometimes not even your closest family. Sometimes I look around here in the US and say to myself, who learned what from who! This is a must see movie for all those who think Socialism is ""so wonderful"".

The movie brings back bitter sweet memories. A Christmas tree, that we were not supposed to call Christmas tree, but Winter tree, decorated with apples, foil wrapped candies, and yes, real candles that we kids were allowed to ... gasp... light up only in our parents presence. The gathering of the entire family a the table. The interdiction to call Santa Claus, Mos Craciun (Uncle Christmas) but call him Uncle Frosty, who by the way would not come on Christmas Eve but on New Years Eve!  The old radio that so many families, including mine, used to turn on and listen to Radio Free Europe, or Voice of America. My father's voice telling me that ""The Americans will come and free us, son"" growing tired with every day that went by without the Americans coming to the rescue. The weak signal of those stations, jammed by the Securitatea's jamming equipment. The leather coats worn by Securitatea (secret police) officers when they came to my High School to interrogate me about why did I write to the Japanese Embassy, and their disbelief when I told them I only wanted a pen pall to improve on my Japanese. The long lines in which we were forced to stay for half a loaf of bread daily, or two pounds of bananas/oranges, 30 eggs, a chocolate, 2 bottles of milk, some chicken legs or wings. The disappointment of getting to the counter and be told there is nothing left. The children screaming in the streets ""There is a truck delivering something at the grocery store"" and the people racing to the front of the store, not knowing what they might be able to purchase, if they got there in time.

Overall, excellent educational movie. Top notch plot, top notch acting, accurate description of the period and of the left tactics.",1495065600,4,2562,4.6467991169977925
8497623,4,B003TFERAM,Intriguing. Lots of lurking and unsmiling faces. Good music. Worth the time spent watching it.,1492992000,,94,5.333333333333333
8497624,5,B003TFERAM,"Great movie! Hungary under communist rule. Well worth the time. I can not believe that the biggest complaint some people have is that you have to read subtitles. Unless you speak Hungarian, yes, you do. Not a big deal for the literate ones.",1492819200,,240,4.604651162790698
