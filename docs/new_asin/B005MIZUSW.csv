8479392,5,B005MIZUSW,"I'm a lifelong journalist, specializing in cross-cultural issues and trends in global media. More than 40 years ago at the University of Michigan, while working in the Film Studies department, I participated in one of the first immersive studies of Alfred Hitchcock's body of work. We viewed what we thought was his entire body of work, but this silent (just before the more-widely known Lodger) was conspicuously absent.

Today, if you consult popular books or even websites about Hitchcock, this movie is dismissively described. In fact, I wonder if some of the authors on Hitchcock's body of work ever saw the movie before writing about it. So, I decided this summer to retrace my course through Hitchcock's movies and discovered this DVD now available at least from some sellers on Amazon. (I ordered my copy from ""M & L"" and it arrived in wonderful fashion.)

I'm writing this review to say: What an eye opener! Classic Hitchcock themes are right here in this very early movie. I could write a much longer essay here, but will avoid that. Just a few examples:

The dynamism of the staircase runs throughout his work. The opening scene of Pleasure Garden features an explosion of show girls cascading down a narrow stairway.

Toying with our assumptions about good and evil -- and even deceptive identities, including dark secrets about sexual impulses -- show up prominently in this film.

We all love Hitchcock's world-weary wisdom that he embodies in secondary characters and the two landlords in this movie are classics.

The final sequence on a tropical island involving two women, two men, a drowning, a ghost, a sword and a gun -- I won't spoil the film by telling who does what to whom in this review -- is textbook Hitchcock.

If you love this master of suspense -- don't miss this early gem!",1467158400,,1805,4.82200647249191
