3971320,4,B002R1O51A,"I'm so excited to see Ghost House get a blu ray release! It's one of those 80's video store classics that, although kinda silly, stuck with me and remains a favorite.

The story revolves around a couple who hear a disturbing transmission on a ham radio and go in search of the origin. What they find is a creepy old house, a creepy clown doll, and some creepy supernatural happenings. Despite some cheesy effects and a story that doesn't always add up, Ghost House is full of things that will leave an impression. The score is disturbingly catchy. The doll is disturbingly creepy. And a scene in a funeral home is disturbingly... disturbing.

I recommend Ghost House to anyone who grew up in the VHS rental generation.",1433894400,10,718,4.645669291338582

Eventually, of course, some teenagers get involved, and weird stuff happens in the house, ligtbulbs expand, floors of goo open,a poltergeist-esque clown doll starts killing. Without giving away too much, the ending would be lifted years later for Final Destination. As for Manos, the hands of Fate, anyone  who is familiar with MST#K knows that this movie is the cheese bomb! Probably campier than Plan 9 from Outer Space, a family on vacation gets lost and wind up at the home of Torgo, the Master, and the Master's many brides.

3971325,5,B002R1O51A,"IN MY OPINION THIS IS LENZI'S BEST FILM,

THIS WAS A PRETTY RARE FILM UNTIL NOW TOO.

""GHOSTHOUSE"" WAS DIRECTED UNDER A PSEUDONYM ""HUMPERT HUMPHREES""

OR SOMEHTING LIKE THAT, BUT IT WAS UMBERTO LENZI WHO DIRECTED.

THERE IS GORE, AN ABSOLUTELY CRAZY PLOT, AND REALLY CREEPY MUSIC,

THE EVIL NURSERY RHYME IS WICKED!

THIS DVD IS WELL WORTH GETTING FOR THIS MOVIE!

I WAS REALLY SURPRISED THAT LENZI DID THIS BECAUSE

ITS NOT REALLY ONE OF THOSE CHEESY/CHEAP/ITALIAN FILMS

3971326,5,B002R1O51A,"Ghosthouse- This is a haunted house movie from the 1980s no doubt inspired by Poltergeist, as there is a young girl reminiscent of Carol Ann and her stuffed clown which looks a lot like the clown in Poltergeist that pulls the boy under the bed. Well this clown is just as evil and some teen that are drawn to a mysterious house find out. This is a fun little known gem with some fun scares.
Manos, The Hands of Fate- This is a b-movie cult gem from the 1960s. Torgo, a creepy guy with really big mis-shapen legs is the caretaker of a home inhabited by a cult consisting of the master, his devil dog, and the master's many brides. It's pure camp cheese that's more ridiculous than Plan 9 From Outer Space.

VAGUE SPOILERS: I like the kind of film that centers around characters that are realistic and not completely shallow, this for me is that kind of movie. Jim is by no means a great guy, but when it comes to making choices that can ruin other people's lives and help him and the person he cares about, he actually has a real human reaction to the problem and tries to find another solution that won't cause harm to anybody else instead of taking the easy way out.

The ghostly witch was creepy and unsettling. It felt like Julie's hallucinations were something out of a nightmare or a feverish dream. I couldn't help but feel like I wanted to do something to help her shake her ghosts and wake back up into reality.

There was a lot of production value, between the beautiful locations, the awesome sets and the elephant!

A lot of horror films these days are cut from the same structure and guidelines. This movie took me back to horror films like The Serpent and the Rainbow.

Overall this isn't a bad film, actually its quite good, where it suffers though is how quickly it is wrapped up, as well as some story details which feel tacked on to make things ""work"" made the story actually less workable in my opinion. I don't know if I would go as far as to say it was ""white washed"" as the film does take effort to fill the gap with correct culture... but it just barely does so in my mind.

I liked this movie- it's one of the best ones I've seen in a long time, horror-wise, and it was really well done, in my opinion. The acting was very good, especially that of Scout Taylor-Compton.  I would really like to see her do some other horror films; she'd be good in anything, but the horror genre is really devoid of good actors these days and I think she could revive it.

Now that I've typed enough that spoilers won't likely be seen accidentally, I liked the movie and the premise of it but the whole way the ghost curse comes about is because Julie and her fiance are essentially flagged down randomly in their hotel lobby by to strange Brits. Oh, hey, how are you doing- this is a beautiful hotel, how about you go out and see the sights with us right now? Why would anyone in their right mind, especially in a foreign country, agree to go off with two strangers? And if you're going to go off with two strangers, why would you let them separate you several times? I suppose there are people that gullible, but I've never met one.

Ghosthouse is basically about a haunted house but the music and feel of the movie are just great.  In fact lenzi would make ttwo more 'house' movies.  One of which was ghosthouse 2 and the other was called  the house of witchcraft.  or ghosthouse 3.  that's how successful ghosthouse was around the world. And it deserves the praise because it's just a fun horror film. with a scary little girl as the main feature no less.  It looks better here than on my dvd that I have for sure.  And you must applaud this company for putting two movies on here.  That's the way old movies should be done. At a reasonable price and with two flicks.  Other companies are charging 29.00 for ONE movie. That is NOT cool.  ""witchery' is not a bad flick either.  And you get horror great 'linda blair' in it too.

3971382,2,B002R1O51A,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I love the fact that Shout/Scream Factory has been releasing some of the forgotten classics in the horror genre to blu-ray. They range from some great films to lesser titles but at least those movies that many flocked to mom and pop video stores in the early days of VHS in search of now have a chance to live once again on not just DVD but blu-ray. It doesnt matter if they were great or bad, some of these movie will always have a place in the hearts of people who were kids when they first saw these movies, films that left an impression on them.

That being said, this duo does not make my list of great movies Im sorry to say. So for those who long to watch these again I say more power to you! For everyone else just be wary. The first film, GHOSTHOUSE, starts off with the bloody murder of a family in 1967, with a little girl locked in a closet in the basement along with her doll. Fast forward 20 years later to a young CB enthusiast who continues to get a call for help, some strange music and some weird noises. Using his computer to track down the signal, he and his girlfriend head out to investigate.

Following the directions they end up at a creepy looking abandoned house. There they discover a fellow CB owner, his girlfriend, his brother and his sister. It is this guys voice on the tape calling for help but he never sent it out and cant understand why his voice is on their recorder. With a name like GHOSTHOUSE as the title you can figure out that there is a haunting going on here. It doesnt take long before the little girl or her doll are seen and bodies begin to pile up. The solution to the problem works well but the moments leading up to the end are a bit tedious. This isn't a bad movie, but it was definitely one of those either quick to VHS or straight to VHS movies from the eighties.

The second film on this release isn't much better. WITCHERY begins with the hunt for a witch in the distant past only to have her toss herself from the window of an old house. Fast forward (notice how both of these movies are like that?) to the present where a researcher into the paranormal and her boyfriend are checking out the house, big enough to be a hotel now, without authorization. Problems soon arise when the local real estate agent shows up with the new owners in tow. The entire group gets stranded on the island where this building is located and soon spooky things begin to happen and bodies begin to pile up. The fact that one of the new owners daughters is pregnant means we have the chance for a possession here which of course happens. Who will survive this night if any remains to be seen.

The claim to fame on this title is that it stars not just David Hasselhoff as the boyfriend but Linda Blair as the soon to be possessed pregnant lady. Even though Blair has been through this famously once before her acting chops on this film seem fairly inadequate. Hasselhoff is the Hoff so he can do no wrong. At least in the eyes of German fans who will probably make this release a hit in that country.

Neither film offers a really satisfying horror film for fans of the genre but it will indeed satiate the needs of those I mentioned before, the youngsters of the 80s who grew up scouring the aisles of video stores in search of any and every horror film they could convince their parents to rent (and then let them watch without supervision knowing full well the small amounts of nudity involved would not go over well). In the end those fans as well as horror fans who feel the need to collect any and all horror films will be pleased with these two movies coming out on blu-ray.

UPDATE: First off I stand corrected. A fellow amazon poster informed me that GHOSTHOUSE did indeed have a theatrical release. Secondly I came across an interesting tidbit on these two films and another as well. When released in Italy GHOSTHOUSE was released as EVIL DEAD 3 and WITCHERY as EVIL DEAD 4. The piece I read concerning these two films discussed the lax copyright laws in Italy that turned a number of films into sequels of other movies while having nothing to do with them. There was also an EVIL DEAD 5 which was released here as BEYOND DARKNESS, a movie that is also being released by Shout/Scream Factory as a double feature with METAMORPHOSIS.",1438300800,2,4333,4.35519801980198

In typical Italian film industry fashion at time, they released their own films ""Ghosthouse"" & ""Witchery"" as La Casa 3 and 4 even though they had nothing to do with the Evil Dead films. The awesome people at Scream Factory had paired both of these films on a bluray double feature for connoisseurs of 80's Italian cheese. Even though neither film is very good by normal film standards, they are still a ton of fun for horror fans.

The first film Ghosthouse features ham radios & a killer doll. The second film Witchery features David Hasselhoff, Linda Blair & witches. Neither film makes a whole lot of sense (particularly Witchery) but both feature plentiful & bloody practical effects work along with campy performances which will have you laughing throughout. The transfers are quite clean and detailed though Ghosthouse looks a bit softer than Witchery but are substantial upgrades over previous DVD releases. Each film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1 so there are some black bars on the sides of each image. Sound is presented in lossless 2 channel stereo and the only extras are theatrical trailers for each. Highly recommended!",1436140800,6,1276,4.880184331797235

3971386,4,B002R1O51A,"Okay, these are two very average features.  Ghosthouse has enough bloody moments and odd-ball cheap horror thrills that makes it worth the purchase alone.  Witchery makes no friggin' sense, but seeing Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff try to survive this stinker (though the deaths are comedically bad) kinda makes it good enough to watch once.  More of a background movie, though.  Both need more extras than a measley trailer.  All in all, not a bad way to pass a chill evening.",1435968000,2,479,4.864197530864198
