8217922,5,B000VBB7SM,This video is incredible! I am not sure how I missed it in 1984. Disney should definitely issue this on DVD (but probably won't). Anyone who is interested in what stunt people (men and women) do will enjoy this video. The best part was the discussion that Host Richard Farnsworth had with his stuntman friends about their work in movies and TV.,1278288000,,344,4.564516129032258
