8710292,5,B00VJIIWIO,"Oh my goodness I loved this movie so much I watched it a second time a few days later!

After 18 years in maximum security Viktor is transferred to a minimum security prison farm for 12 months in preparation for his release. When senior prison officer Matt Perry initiates a bird rehabilitation program for injured birds, he puts Viktor in charge of the project. As the movie unfolds we witness the healing of Viktor's damaged soul, along with the physical healing of Yasmine, the beautiful wedge-tailed eagle.

This film is deep, moving and beautiful but also inspiring and uplifting. The acting is superb, truly outstanding performances by the entire cast. The birds are magnificent and the scenery is beautiful, one scene in particular comes to mind where the two officers are fishing and the lake sparkles from the reflection of the sun. There is a wonderful undercurrent of Aussie humour that threads its way throughout the story. I loved the friendship dynamic between the two senior prison officers, Mr Perry and Mr Egan and watching the trust that developed between Viktor and Mr Perry.

It's so lovely to see a film that portrays prisoners and prison officers as essentially decent people. It shows what can be achieved if the establishment makes a genuine effort to support prisoners in their rehabilitation. After all, the film is based on a true story. There is no violence in this film but the ""f"" word is used quite liberally as you would expect in a real prison setting but this is why it's R rated.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1469318400,,1551,4.733333333333333
8710293,1,B00VJIIWIO,Worst movie all year..,1467676800,,22,4.75
8710294,5,B00VJIIWIO,"This is a very good story of redemption, Australian style. Would have loved to have had the option to purchase in Blu Ray format. Nice addition to any film library.",1449100800,,164,4.5
8710295,2,B00VJIIWIO,"Cinematography was good.
The movie was made in Australia.  A lot of the dialogue couldn't be understood because of the Australian accent.
The story was slow moving and not very interesting.
Overall, the film is not worth watching.",1437868800,,230,5.052631578947368
8710296,5,B00VJIIWIO,It was a very uplifting movie and the cast is wonderful and very familiar to American audiences.  Don Hany was wonderful as Viktor.  Five stars!,1436400000,,144,4.72
8710297,5,B00VJIIWIO,"This film, purportedly based upon actual events, deals with the lives of a few individuals in a minimum prison facility set against the background of the beautiful wide open spaces of Victoria, Australia. One of the prisoners, of Iranian descent (sympathetically played by Don Hany), accidentally finds solace in the care and rehabilitation of injured birds. (Some may find an echo of ""Birdman of Alcatraz"", a film starring Burt Lancaster from 1962.)  With the assistance of two youthful fellow inmates (also well played by Mark Leonard Winter and the excellent Xavier Samuel [""Anonymous"", ""Bait"", ""Adore"", ""Twilight"", ""Newcastle""]), aviary facilities are built on the prison grounds (which looks more like a summer camp) and the joy and reward of caring for the injured birds (a magnificent eagle and captivating owl are the two main ""patients"") becomes infectious. A transformative process takes hold and all three gradually reconcile with their respective pasts and current situation.  The birds heal and so do their ""care givers"".  All takes place under the encouraging and watchful eye of one of the top prison guards deftly played by Hugo Weaving (almost unrecognizable with a beard) who also benefits from the ""bird project"".  The real stars of this film are the birds. The soaring majesty of the eagle/raptor and the cuteness of the owl make for a profound visual experience. The closeup of their eyes and wings is magnetic. The relationship between the humans and birds really drives home the point that, in the end, we all share the same planet and must deal with our own particular adversity.  The cinematography was beautful and the acting highly realistic. A couple of side notes:  1) The film has been given an R rating due to language.  A PG-13 at most would have been more appropriate. Indeed, in any other setting it would have seemed more like a ""family movie"", especially since the birds are brought out and ""perform"" before a large group of adults and children under controlled conditions a number of times. 2) For anyone who has heard or read about the fact that the prehistoric dinosaurs evolved into birds, I would invite the viewer to look very closely at the beak of the eagle/raptor and his talons and compare those two anatomical features to those of various dinosaur recreations.",1433894400,6,2307,5.023560209424084
8710298,5,B00VJIIWIO,"Not sure what's with the American DVD cover as the film's prison in Victoria is a final years, become day release open farm type place, there are no guard towers, prisoners wearing orange or guards holding automatic weapons.  That's what makes this film so refreshing, it's not doing the usual Hollywood style prison violence, waiting to get shived, becoming someone's sex toy, corrupt sadistic guards type norm.  It's just a normal everyday minimum security prison.  There is one prisoner bully in the film, but even he's the type if someone punched him in the face (which they wouldn't as they'd go back to a less freedoms prison) he'd fall into a ball yelling I'm sorry don't hit me through his sobbing tears.  Also Hugo Weaving has a beard for the entire film so what's with him clean shaven wearing an American style prison guard uniform on the cover?

Enough about the cover though, this is a really good film, loosely based on an actual rehabilitation program started on a Victorian prison farm by Healsville Sanctuary where inmates look after large birds of prey that have been handed in by the public found injured on their farms, hit by cars and son on. The prisoners build the enclosures and look after them while the birds heal so they hopefully will be able to be released back to the wild when ready.  Of course you can draw parallels between the humans doing time hopefully being made ready to be released back into society and the birds.

Hugo Weaving plays Matt, a prison guard (or more accurately prison case worker as they are called at this level of the prison system) who is an avid bird watcher/rescuer in his time off.  When Viktor, a former violent prisoner sentenced for murder 18 years before is relocated to the prison farm none of the other staff really wants to take him on as one of their responsibilities.  The other prisoners are scared of him so finding suitable prison work for the man to do without needing a lot of staff hanging around to help him be ready for a return to society is looking like a real challenge. However when on a work assignment on a nearby property, a huge wedge-tail eagle is found caught in the barbed wire of a fence.  When another prisoner motions with a shovel to put it out of its misery Viktor who has minded his own business and stayed out of trouble up to then grabs the guy by the throat and lets everyone know in no uncertain terms, that is not going to happen.  Luckily Matt is one of the case workers at the site and calms the situation by guaranteeing he will take the bird to Healesville sanctuary. There he overhears a tantrum throwing management type saying they can't afford to keep feeding all these handed in birds and to start putting them down.  Seeing that Viktor had shown he actually can care about something, Matt comes up with a plan to house (and obviously the government pays so the sanctuary doesn't have to), to take some of the birds to the prison.  The movie of course is about  seeing if that plan will work.

It's a very enjoyable movie, that although obviously pretty predictable it is still a nice journey there.  It is little wonder this won a few film festival awards.",1433548800,,3164,4.563604240282685
