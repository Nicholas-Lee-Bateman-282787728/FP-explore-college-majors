3857391,3,B0026VBOOW,"After watching Evil Bong, Sid considered it only fair to check out the sequel to complete the series. It's become evident Full Moon is taking a stand in getting weed legal by offering some hilarious b horror to support the movement. This time around the original cast, which had to leave their couches for a couple days to make a movie, has been having some issues after destroying the bong. One of the guys passes out every five minutes, one got really fat, and the other can't stop humping everything within reach. They look to their nerdy friend for help and head off to the Amazon to find the origin of the bong. In their journey they find the true bong, the King Bong, and find a way to end their side effects.

Sid enjoyed this one a little less then the first, but still got enough laughs out of it to make it a 3 star effort. It's pretty much 80 some odd minutes of cheap laughs, weed smoking, with some great bong action. Like we said in the original flick you can't expect too much from any Full Moon feature, especially when it has the title Evil Bong. So if you are looking for anything even remotely serious the steer far clear from this one because you will be supremely let down. However if you're a b lover like Sid this one should be worth the watch.",1250640000,5,1267,4.301255230125523
3857392,5,B0026VBOOW,"You've gotta see EVIL BONG 2: KING BONG on dvd from Full Moon Features. It's a freakin' riot. I thought it was much better than the first one. The pacing is a lot stronger. Although we start out with roughly the first 20 minutes of the movie taking place in Larnell's apartment, the writing is more competent and a lot funnier this time out. Between Brett (Brian Lloyd) showing up in that fat suit and Larnell's chronic erection and dry humping there's quite a few laughs to be had. It REALLY takes off once it moves to the jungle. Grandpa's constant verbal abuse is a riot, lots of pot smoking, and HOLY MAN, those Poontang tribe girls are hot! Plus Rabbit, the UPS delivery guy is great!
Plenty of EeeBee and they gave her much better dialogue to say this time out; I liked that her mouth moved a bit more. Plus once King Bong arrives on the scene their interaction is pretty crude, non-PC, and hilarious. (Oh, man! There is a raunchy song/rant from King Bong during the closing credits you've got to hear!) Less of a horror angle this time out. I have to say though, even being a horror fan, I'll probably have more repeat viewings of this one than the first, sort of the same way I feel about Gingerdead Man 2. I was REALLY pleased with King Bong!",1247270400,3,1251,4.373390557939914
3857393,2,B0026VBOOW,"Sheesh.  Like Gingerdead Man 2, I'm really not sure why I bothered to watch this considering I wasn't too gung-ho about the first one.  But I suppose it's folks like me as well as stoners who keep films like this in production.  I mean, somebody liked Evil Bong enough to make Charles Band make a sequel.
In Evil Bong 2, the survivors of the first Evil Bong's reign of terror are suffering from exaggerated stoner side effects.  This includes constant narcolepsy, terminal horniness and overeating.  In order to find a cure, they get in contact with the hero of the first film, ""Al""(played by a different actor this time), the straight, nerdy, anti-pot guy.  They also get in contact with the delivery guy who originally delivered the bong and trace it's origins to a jungle in South America.  Our heroes go on a jungle quest to find the bong's birthplace, thinking somehow that will help them figure out a cure.  What they discover is a hot chick harvesting marijuana for medicinal purposes, a native tribe of hot women called the ""Poon Tang Tribe"", and......The King Bong.  The King Bong is the much more powerful ""boyfriend"" of the Evil Bong.
To me it seems like Full Moon is only really interested in doing flat out comedies anymore, which this obviously is.  Unfortunately it's not terribly funny.  A few minor chuckles here and there, but the humor is nothing you wouldn't find in about 8,000 other stoner/raunchy/teen comedies.  I guess if you're stoned the film is hysterical, but then again, most things are.  I'm sure even Will Ferrell is funny if you're baked enough.
No one even dies in the film!  At one time, Full Moon actually made attempts to make horror films.  Sure, a bunch of them fell flat and were unintentionally funny, but Full Moon is funnier and more entertaining when trying to be scary than when they are actually trying to be funny.
But this film will no doubt be rented or purchased by those who liked the first one(and you know who you are!).  I actually did like the first one more because of the whole alternate universe inside the bong that was full of Full Moon characters from different films.  And as dumb as it was, it was actually horrorish, as characters were slaughtered inside the bong.  No slaughtering or anything here, just a full on stoner comedy.  You'll watch it I'm sure, but don't watch it if you aren't stoned.",1247011200,,2361,4.659420289855072

8353626,3,B0026VBOOW,"It is hard pressed to classify this as a ""horror"" movie. It is a stoner comedy. If you are not stoned, you most likely won't find much humor in this film. If you missed the first feature, they play excerpts from it in the beginning to bring you up to speed, although I don't know why. Three stoners have smoked from the ""evil bong"" and have contracted gross side effects. One has a permanent case of the munchies. The second is paranoid and always horny. The is narcoleptic and has something else which I forgot. In order to get ""cured"" of their ailments they travel to the jungle, to the birthplace of the bong, only to find a larger bong they must combat as well as the bong's henchmen which are actually topless jungle women (porn stars).

The acting was bad and the plot was cheesy as expected. The problem was the jokes were on the lame side.

F-bomb, sex talk, nudity (Ariel X.,Kyle Stone, Kat, Emilianna) Add a star if stoned.",1329955200,,933,4.4186046511627906
8353627,2,B0026VBOOW,"Okay, so I purchased this with low expectations.  The first movie was funny because of how horrible it was, but this was truly bad!  Same characters...good.  Same plot bad.",1314316800,,172,4.862068965517241
8353628,5,B0026VBOOW,"Last weekend I went to the full moon road show in chicago and had a great time meeting robin sydney and charles band along with watching castle freak,from beyond ,evil bong 3d with scratch and sniff should of called it scratch and stink pewwww the card it is. Evil Bong 2 was better then the first tons more laughs and great same old cast as part 1. Great movie for friends to watch with funny jokes and sexy woman in it. If you like to chill out with your friends and see goofy acting this is the movie for you. If anyone doesn't like this they can't take jokes at all. Also you must see pt 3 in 3D its worth it. Can't wait for pt 4. Thank you charles band for making a wacky series keep the series going.",1302739200,,706,4.05
8353629,1,B0026VBOOW,"I bought this movie because I like Robyn Sidney, who I met and actually had a conversation with at Comic Con.  She had a very small part in the movie, and it is a bad movie.  Goofy plot and bad acting.  Save your money",1301356800,,218,3.909090909090909
8353630,3,B0026VBOOW,"Evil Bong 2: King Bong is pretty much like the first Evil Bong, so if you liked that one you should like this one too. And if you didn't like the first one, you won't like this one either. It's funny...up to a point. The first half has plenty of hilarious moments, most of them involving a foul-mouthed Grandpa. However, it loses steam in the second half.",1301184000,,355,4.313432835820896
