6025994,4,B00FR81Z40,"This is incredible. Volume 11, which included the entirety of Season 10 (all 23 episodes from 2011-12; and without censored dialogue, either) just came out in September of this year (2013). Now Fox continues to exceed expectations by turning out yet another full season, Season 11 (with the 22 episodes shown 2012-13), just three months later! After many years of their bizarre tradition of putting the last half of one season and the first half of the next season into the same set, and never having a logical system for releasing the ""seasons"" or partial-""seasons"" in a timely manner, and sometimes only releasing a partial season at full price, they are now making up for a decade of frustration by twice in a row--TWICE!--putting out complete seasons in the same box. The price is no higher than the incomplete volumes they used to give us, and it's almost a certainty that Amazon will give you a nice price break if you pre-order. The last volume, for example (DVD Volume 11, Season 10) was also priced around $35 in June, but then it very temporarily dipped down to $19.99 just before it's release in September, so that lower price was locked in for me and that's what I ended up paying.",1383868800,45,1193,4.685714285714286

6026026,1,B00FR81Z40,"While I love Family Guy, I'm won't buy any more DVDs. They are the worst quality I have ever encountered. The plastic insert that is meant to hold the DVDs in place won't stay in place itself, and the DVDs skip and freeze to the point you can't even watch them. This isn't only this particular DVD, but several FG DVDs I have. Come on, Family Guy.

6026049,4,B00FR81Z40,"We have all the Family Guy volumes up to this point. My personal opinion is the series has mostly run its course. But, if you have been collecting these volumes you should pay the money and add it to your collection. It should be noted that all Family Guy DVDs contain the unedited language that was not broadcast on T.V. so there is plenty of adult language if you are concerned about it for teens or children.",1438473600,,411,4.35064935064935
6026050,5,B00FR81Z40,"Just so you know...I believe this is season 11 so don't let that throw you as the package says ""Volume 12"". I know because I also own the complete Season 12 three-disc set which includes the sad story about Brian's death (Life of Brian) . Ok, with that said, this Volume 12 three-disc set's main highlight is the ""milestone 200th episode"" about Stewie's time machine going into a meltdown after Brian's haphazard attempt to ""erase the mileage"" of his bar-girl adventures, backfires.

The best highlights of this particular DVD set: the Mike Damone gag, Herbert the Pervert (yep I still call him that!) makes a reference to a well-known ED drug, Quagmire,  the biggest womanizer on Spooner Street accidentally (exactly how do you do that?) marries a prostitute, the Griffins get involved with a drug lab when they're down on the farm, and Brian tries to undercut Stewie's writing ability. Fifteen (give or take a few, who's counting, right?) years later, they are still standing the test of time, if anyone else thinks they are ""jumping the shark"" for any reason.

My favorite parts from this series: Meg blackmails Chris when she catches him stealing money. It was obvious to me at the time, Meg has unresolved issues and just wanted to lash out at her brother (OK, that's how I felt) Brian (at first, anyway) doesn't get what Stewie sees in the music of Anne Murray...I have always felt the same way as Brian, her music always struck me as pallid and boring. I'm glad that the truth was told. Meg is hung up on a gag student at school. She is so crushed when her crush drops the bomb. That part I did not get. It sucks a lot less to be turned down by a sincere gay guy than a straight guy who can only come off as ambiguous about why you are not ""his type""...I thought Meg was fortunate, but apparently she goes off the deep end. Also, Peter befriends a Muslim who turns out to be a terrorist. I could not help but notice that episode ""Turban Cowboy"" gets a lot less airplay on national television (Adult Swim is the major network I am basing this on)

Yes, this set is the uncensored version. The f-bombs, s-bombs, and yes, a c-bomb or two, is heard. An ethnic slur or two that I will not repeat here. Family Guy is still standing the test of time, their trademark crassness, cutaway gags, and pushing-the-envelope of society's norms, is what makes them genuinely funny, in a sadly unfunny world.",1436140800,3,2398,4.556844547563805
6026051,5,B00FR81Z40,More FG is a GOOD thang!  No other cartoon present day makes me laugh....Simpsons is close...but FG has more edge.,1433980800,,114,4.7
6026052,4,B00FR81Z40,"This is pretty standard fare for what Family Guy has been the last few years.  I would not say it is necessarily as edgy or funny consistently as it was in the first few seasons (although it does have its moments).  One thing you do get with the DVD version is the uncensored dialog that either is changed or bleeped out on the broadcast version.  As has pretty much always been the case there is no subject that is too taboo for the show.  They joke about everything.  Some work and some do not, but that has pretty much always been the case with the show.  It does lean heavily on the Stewie-Brian buddy episodes.  The main one this season is the two of them traveling to Vegas.  The big highlight of the season is the fact that the show made it to 200 episodes, and the actual episode has time reversed so we see many of the famous moments from throughout the series occurring in reverse.

For extras there are deleted scenes for every episode, animatics for a couple of the episodes, the comic-con panel leading into the season, a featurette on the 200th episode, and the table read for the 200th episode.  Not a ton of material, but good for what is there.

Ultimately the show is not right for everyone.  It has a distinct brand of humor that you will either like or not.  Also, it is entirely possible to feel the show is running out of steam and becoming repetitive.  If you have been in that camp for the prior seasons this one is not really going to get rid of that feeling.  That said, if you are a die hard fan of the show there are certainly entertaining moments.  If you love the show and/or collect the DVDs I think the DVD sets are worth picking up.  If you are more lukewarm to the show and do not really care about the extras then you may just want to stream it.",1432080000,,1780,4.25

Then it went grey screen. So returned the dvd and got another, but guess what same s*** differnet dvd. Sure would like to see volumn 12, love the uncensored, all the language, sex and all.

6026119,5,B00FR81Z40,"Can Seth McFarlane can write a bad episode of Family Guy?  Judging from the episodes in this collection the answer appears to be an emphatic NO.

There seems (subjectively) to be a greater number of deleted scenes (in some episodes) than in previous collections.

It's hard to pick favorites, but if I had to, I'd say that Yug Yilmaf and Space Camp particularly shine.",1389225600,5,368,4.71875
6026120,3,B00FR81Z40,"There is something to be said about a show that actually can have quality episodes in its eleventh (!!) season. Even though it may as well just be canceled, as it is very inferior to the episodes of past, there are some very good, quality episodes in this collection. Also, they're continuing the trend of full episode collections after the last set (three months ago, a new record for fast releases) ""The Old Man and the Big 'C'"". ""Joe's Revenge"", ""Yug Ylimaf"", ""Brian's Play"", ""Valentine's Day"", ""12 and a Half Angry Men"", ""Total Recall"", ""Roads to Vegas"". All of those are excellent to very good. However, the rest are plagued by poor jokes and story, obviously the crew is burnt out, and it shows in this collection. However, the saving grace is the extras. Man, are there a lot for a Fox Home Entertainment disc. Commentaries on a hefty amount of episodes, deleted scenes (all of which aren't actually that bad), a featurette, a table read (hilarious), animatics, and another Comic-Con panel. Very good extras, OK set of episodes (overall way better the last set). equals a pretty good set. Recommended.

Oh, and be warned, like every set since volume 7, it comes in clear regular disc packaging, which is fragile and able to break while shipping. Mine did, unfortunately, so if this bothers you prepare to return it at least once. This didn't deter me, since I have a few empty ones laying around, but the second disc was scratched a little, so even if you don't mind, it can still scratch.",1388102400,3,1496,4.688212927756654

6026123,3,B00FR81Z40,"Am a huge fan of the show. Vol 11 and all previous volumes play in my DVD player. The player is a Panasonic, only about a year and a half old. These discs won't play. I sent them back. Amazon sent a replacement right away. The new ones won't play. I called the number on the box for Fox Searchlight. They said the haven't heard other complaints like this.
