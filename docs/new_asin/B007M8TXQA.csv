8694031,5,B007M8TXQA,"Well worth the price for the quality delivered on these blu-ray discs.
Some are more complete with scenes missing in the U.S. versions.
The sound is cleaner also without crackles and distortion that exists in the audio portion of the U.S. versions.
Also, the image quality is sharp and crisp unlike the U.S. Sources.
The best I've seen for the U.S. version is the Lion's Gate version with the Metal Mach 5 container.",1409961600,2,416,4.712328767123288
8694032,3,B007M8TXQA,Why would anyone in their right mind buy these blur ays at THAT CRAZY PRICE? just give me an option for the US version so i can play it in Japanese. You all know that these characters are all Japanese right? Speed's name is actually Go Mifune. i hate getting english dubbed movies. ever seen Bruce Lee's movies when he is speaking Cantonese and not dubbed in English. it is a totally different movie and never seems cheesy B movie.,1387497600,,431,4.4
