8513685,5,B007B25NC0,"The video quality is excellent, and boy do these episodes bring back great memories.  All 5 PAL/European DVDs were easily converted to NTSC, Region 1, USA compatibility on a PC utilizing DVDFab SW.  Remember to turn off German soundtrack, then select U.S. English, & turn off the annoying subtitles, and you end up with a DVD that plays perfectly on your home DVD player/television. The DVD tri-fold packaging is professionally printed/manufactured.  DVDs are professionally replicated; NOT burned.  This Amazon.com buyer is most pleased.  I will purchase other seasons now.  Buy with confidence.  PS:  DVD set came from Poland.",1377561600,,628,5.336734693877551
