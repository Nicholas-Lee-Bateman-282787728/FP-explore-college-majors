8170604,4,B0007CEX36,Purchased this dvd for THE BARON starring Calvin Lockhart.  Filmed in the late 60s.  How far would you go to make your goal a reality?  Gritty afro centric film of a charming hustler gambling everything he has on his last big break.  Huge bankroll & lives are at risk.  Will he survive and achieve his dream or will the MOB cancel his contract?  One Lockhart gem worth seeing.  Removed 1 star: dvd transfer grade B-C.,1460592000,,417,4.48
