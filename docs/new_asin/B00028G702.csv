8023801,2,B00028G702,"I have two Fleischer Superman DVDs.  I have this one and I also have one I picked up in Japan.  The Japanese one (which only features half of the cartoons) is far superior to this one.  The prints in these dvds, so far, appears to have been blown up from other videos that were much smaller in resolution.  Sorry, but I think better quality video exists somewhere else.",1344556800,4,369,4.382352941176471
