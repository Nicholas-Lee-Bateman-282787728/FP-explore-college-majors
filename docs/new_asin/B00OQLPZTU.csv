8684502,5,B00OQLPZTU,"I really enjoy movies made in the Florida area, great scenery with the beaches and that Florida rain. This film showed a realistic view of how the mafia would treat someone in debt. Also the lead actor Demetri who did an amazing job in his role he is an ex Navy Seal turned strip club owner. The compassion he shows for his club and employees is captured very well. He doesn't turn on his Navy Seal mentality until the heats is on with them Japanese Yakuza. Great film showing the battles of depression with alcohol and drugs which is very realistic. This is not an action packed Fast and the Furious  but I would definitely  recommend this movie for its heart and mental stimulation that a lot of other films lack.",1429660800,,715,4.450381679389313
