8708629,3,B00UXMC422,"This recording is in English, according to Wikipedia.  I would have thought by 1978 the Met would be doing this in Czech.  Too bad the listing doesn't give us any information.  Also, does it have subtitles?  Even if it's in English, do they think audiences can understand the sung text?  They can't.  There are oo many unanswered questions to lay out big bucks for this pricier-than-average opera DVD.

P.S.  Happy Birthday Teresa Stratas, who turns 80 this month (May 26).

Addendum:  Leave it to Amazon's chief e-Competitor to post a photo of the backside of this DVD cover to get some pertinent information.  It says:  English language production;  optional English subtitles;  NTSC and region-free DVD.  I went ahead and ordered from Amazon only to get it from the Met Opera gift shop, a small way of supporting them.",1525392000,,821,4.8478260869565215
8708630,5,B00UXMC422,A lot of fun.  The production honors the material.  It was great to see Martti Talvela and Jon Vickers doing comedy.,1462665600,,116,4.476190476190476
