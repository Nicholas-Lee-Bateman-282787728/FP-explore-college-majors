These collections have some great episodes that I have loved over the past few years. On the first disc there are two oscar-winning awards called ""Mouse Trouble"" and ""Johann Mouse"". One of my favorite episodes on the first disc is ""Yankee Doodle Mouse"". Jerry tries to ambush Tom with dynamite and other surprises. At the end, he gets Tom tied to a rocket which goes out the window and into the sky. On the second disc, I especiallly liked ""Cue Ball Cat"". I liked the part when Tom stuck his pool stick in the hole to try to hit Jerry, but Jerry ties a needle on the stick and the needle goes into Tom's butt. On the second collection, I loved ""Part Time Pal"". I liked the part when the bottles exploded in Tom's face! After that, Tom just threw them behind him. In ""The Lonesome Mouse"", Tom had been thrown out of the house because Jerry had thrown a vase down on Tom's head. Jerry gets lonely so he makes a plan for Tom to get in the house. At one point, Jerry turns the heat on and burns Mammy Two shoes. I also liked ""Triplet Trouble"" and the part where Tom launches three pies at the three naughty cats and hits them right in the face.

2386284,5,B000ADWDK2,"The only problem with these DVDs is that they'll make you face hurt because you'll be laughing so much.  My wife had recently watched some of the trash that's on saturday mornings these days and she made a comment about the good ol' days of Tom and Jerry.  So...we bought The Spotlight Collection (vol. 1 and 2) and were able to laugh at cartoons once again!  I'm not usually a big laugher, and in fact work hard to maintain a generally straight face, but these literally had me on the ground holding my stomach.

Of particularly fond memory are the episodes where Jerry floods the kitchen and ice skates, when Tom creates the elixer that transforms Jerry into a muscle-bound mouse, when Tom's playing the piano at a concert and Jerry interferes, when Tom and Jerry are chasing each other around the dog pound and Spike screams like a little girl, and when Tom discovers that a cornered mouse will, in fact, fight back.  All these and tons more are included in these hilarious eposides!

Whoopi Goldberg gives an excellent introduction to the mindsets at the time of the creation of Tom and Jerry.  Her introduction is insightful and helpful for looking at the cartoons now in light of the growth that society has gone through in working at rejecting racism (although it's still here in many places in full force, sadly).

In short, if you're really looking to laugh with fond memory or new discovery at some incredible and classic animation slapstick humour, look no further than here...enjoy!

8078164,5,B000ADWDK2,"My son has the Tom & Jerry video game, then found some old shows on our cable.  When he was scheduled for surgery and was told he would have to be in bed for a few weeks, i wanted to find something to keep him busy and this was a blessing.  He loves this one and has occasionally sat through both disks without a sound.  Contains many of the early shows that i enjoyed watching as a kid.  Yes, by todays standards, it would probably be labeled as containing 'violence', but it's still fun to watch.  Bought the second set also, which is just as enjoyable.",1198281600,,555,4.19811320754717
8078165,5,B000ADWDK2,"Proponents of anti-violence on TV should pay attention to the nonsense that is shown nowadays on kids' channels.  The good message new cartoons try to convey is lost amid hideous, screaming, and insane characters that leave parents perplexed and anxious.  This collection of Tom and Jerry brings sanity back.  It teaches about love and chivalry, war and peace, and friendship and forgiveness.  Animators of olden days actually used their minds to create very clever, beautifully drawn and entertaining plots that even parents can enjoy watching.  As far as violence is concerned, many people who grew up watching Tom and Jerry are now lawyers and doctors, engineers and architects.  I have no idea how modern cartoons will affect young minds.  As far as this collection is concerned, sit back and enjoy the show- it's a classic!",1191715200,3,828,5.088888888888889
