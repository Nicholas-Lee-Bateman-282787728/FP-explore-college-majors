8335477,4,B001QE9988,"Theres a lot of quality banjo playing on this DVD along with some beautiful recordings of Mark and Emory playing tunes. I feel like in general, Marks instruction lacks focus and I initially found myself more than a little frustrated at his tempos during the more complex tunes. I have the feeling this production was recorded in one take without the presentation being rigidly planned beforehand. Putting aside the shortcomings of the delivery, Mark is an seriously good banjo player and just getting a close look at his hands might be worth the price of entry.

Be prepared to watch this DVD many times -- likely over the course of a few weeks -- before you can really start absorbing its content. Mark has an impressive knowledge of the fingerboard and if you're going to follow along with him, you're going to need to get somewhere close to his level. So, if you're like me, you're going to need to spend at least a few days practicing your chords and learning note locations in the first and second positions.

For reference, Im probably an intermediate level player who regularly jams in sessions and am comfortable playing in popular keys. I spent around two weeks practicing his (really cool) picking patterns and just getting more comfortable moving around the fingerboard.  It wasn't the most fun but gradually I started hearing his influence creep into my regular playing. My music buddies have noticed the improvement as well and theyve asked what Ive been doing to mix it up. Its pretty cool and its motivated me to go back to the DVD to absorb more of Marks magic.

I haven't played around with the tabbed versions of his songs but I was annoyed they didn't include chord progressions.

In conclusion, theres a lot of good stuff here for someone whos ready to move beyond the basic bum-ditty and drop thumbs. Just remember the juicy content inside isn't spoon fed to you, but your friends might notice if you decide to stick with it.",1500940800,,1946,4.711764705882353
8335478,4,B001QE9988,"Mark's not the most gifted teacher (he doesn't explain things real well) and it is a bit more advanced for someone like myself who has been playing clawhammer banjo for a few months. However, he makes up for more in his ability to inspire you to blend these great styles and my musical abilities allowed me to catch on pretty quickly to what Mark was doing and I look forward to growing as a clawgrass player!",1413331200,,409,4.394736842105263
8335479,4,B001QE9988,"I haven't ""studied"" this video yet, but have watched it. It is apparent that if you don't know how to play the banjo, notes and chording, you've got a lot of work ahead of you. Mark is the Master of this technique and does a wonderful job. I am happy with my purchase. Even if you don't walk away being a Clawgrass expert, it is just very enjoyable to watch him perform at close range. Good Luck!",1379203200,,396,4.1558441558441555
8335480,5,B001QE9988,"A bit advanced, not a beginners course, but if you know the fundamentals, a great series of lessons. I like his approach!",1377475200,,121,4.545454545454546
8335481,5,B001QE9988,"Mark Johnson is for you.  This DVD and accompanying booklet was recommended by a friend who plays banjo in a band.  He, like me, has struggled with frailing/clawhammer after learning Scruggs Style (3 finger).  Mark blends the two into something that is smoother and more rhythmic than either is by itself.  Now I see how my banjo teacher produces the sounds she does...

Good stuff.

8335482,3,B001QE9988,he outlines an excellent approach to the five string traditional banjo updated for contemporary 5string.  The DVD is woefully short of examples as is the accompanying tablature.  The music is beauiful.  The subject material would have been better placed in a comprehensive book with tab. If he produces one I will buy it.,1247529600,,321,5.018867924528302
