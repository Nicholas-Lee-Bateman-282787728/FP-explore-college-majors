8422645,1,B004C1K5TY,"I had just finished watching AVP with Lance Henriksen in it, and i was thinking he's such a good actor. Loved him in the Pumpkinhead movies, AVP, Powder, and the Millennium TV Series; i have to check out other movies that he's in. I came across this one and hey i bought the movie cuz of him, the cover looked cool and the description sounded awesome...MY GOD WAS I WRONG!!!
I thought it was just horrible, I don't know how far I got into the movie before i got so annoyed from thinking, ""when is this gonna end"" that I took it out because i just couldn't deal with it.
It was like a B made movie, the only effect that I dug was the chick's uterus ripped out in the beginning. I thought the effect of the creatures penis was retarded, like it came out from a hole in the costume and came out in a robotic motion. they couldn't have done a better effect with that? Make it actually look like a creatures penis and to umm have it look real!!! The main character that was the cop, was pretty cool but how he did the stuff he did and still was able to be a cop I got no clue. in reality he would have gotten off the force with the stuff he was doing...maybe thats just my opinion though.  I felt like Lance really tried and I just wasn't feeling it. he couldn't save this movie in my eyes. I had even looked on IMDb of his filmography, I wanted to know if this was made before his big good movies or what not and I couldn't find it! Is it that horrible that they don't wanna put in his list, come to find that there's another name for it ""Dying God"", I than looked back and looked for that title and that one was there and it said 2008. No one that I have talked too has seen this movie (now I know probably why no one has lol),  I think I have to let them borrow it so I can share my disappointment. I guess you gotta have some not so good movies in a collection. Sorry Lance but you should keep FInal Spawn aka Dying God off your filmography list!!",1311120000,2,1946,4.025839793281654
