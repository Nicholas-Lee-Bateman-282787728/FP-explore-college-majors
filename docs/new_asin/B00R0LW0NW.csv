8693640,4,B00R0LW0NW,"This review is strictly about the DVD, I purchased this DVD directly from Railfandepot who apparently sells through amazon too.

Before I even put the DVD in, I held my expectations low because this isn't a well known name producing this DVD. (At least not well known to me.) The movie starts out with a bit of narration explaining the location of Sand Patch. The narration only lasts for maybe 2 minutes and then it is train after train from that point on. This movie doesn't try to get artsy with the trains and try to set the mood or ad a bit of drama or emotion through narration, no it is down and to the point. Best of all any emotion or feeling you get from this video is from the video itself capturing these employees as they worked, or from the well preserved footage and sound captured as the trains pass. I thought the lack of narration would become a negative but after a few minutes of these trains passing by you forget about it. If you are on the fence about this DVD or have only watched Pentrex DVD's this movie its well worth the asking price. It's not a perfect DVD for sure but the footage is very unique and it shows off Chessie System beautifully. However the one issue I do have with this DVD is that the disc it was recorded onto doesn't work on newer players. It must be played in an older DVD player or PC, other then that I have nothing negative to say about this DVD. I will be purchasing Sand Patch 2 because I enjoyed this one so much.",1512172800,,1466,4.235714285714286
