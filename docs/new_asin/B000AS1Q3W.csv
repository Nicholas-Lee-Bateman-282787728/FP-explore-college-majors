2390913,5,B000AS1Q3W,Thank-you!...what a treat to once again see the musical heroes of my youth.  Beautifully done...I have already recommended it to several of my friends.,1211846400,,151,5.291666666666667
2390914,5,B000AS1Q3W,"This DVD/CD is one of the most spiritually intimate collections of its kind with a group of Jesus music pioneers gathered together years later to worship and reflect together.  It is informative, as well as spiritually moving.  It will make you laugh, cry and get up and dance!",1207353600,,277,4.75
2390915,5,B000AS1Q3W,"WE OWNED THE VHS FOR YEARS AND WAS SUPER EXCITED WHEN THE DVD CAME OUT . THE PICTURE IS MUCH CLEARER AND MUSIC IS BRIGHT .WHAT A GREAT WAY TO SIT DOWN WITH A LOVE ONE IN THE LORD AND WORSHIP TO GREAT MUSIC FROM THE PAST. MY WIFE AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SEE MOST OF THE ARTISTS IN PERSON WHEN THEY WERE TOURING. THIS BROUGHT BACK GREAT MEMORIES.
YOUR WONT BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. WE HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL AND PASSED THEM ON TO FRIENDS.",1198800000,3,438,4.045977011494253
2390916,5,B000AS1Q3W,I thought this was a great documentary. The pioneers of Christian music had some great testimonies along with their great music. I would recomend this to all Christians and those who are looking for answers about Jesus.,1168300800,4,219,4.945945945945946
2390917,5,B000AS1Q3W,"I wasn't raised on ""Christian"" music, and before watching First Love I had no knowledge of how the movement got started. My only exposure to Christian music has occurred in the last seven years. Frankly, it's been a disappointing experience. This whole ""CCM"" Hollywood mentality reaches deep into Christian music. And I wondered why I found it all so distasteful--until I watched First Love.

Wow.

I wasn't there when these pioneers hit the road in their beat up buses, just to play a few songs on their old guitars to crowds of starving, young Jesus freaks. But something in my heart tells me I must have been there in spirit, because I felt completely overwhelmed watching this video. I was so excited to see the old video footage and images. It was like going home. I was moved to tears when Honeytree sang ""Pioneer"" - as was everyone else in the room with her. ""Pioneer"" is the essence of everything they lived and breathed in those days.

These artists were truly pioneers. I see that this is what Christian music should be like today. And I'm going to stop feeling bad about disliking today's ""CCM"" mentality, because it really is utter degradation of what used to be the REAL reason why people sang their hearts out for Jesus.",1167782400,50,1234,4.651376146788991
2390918,5,B000AS1Q3W,"First Love is an anthology of the early Jesus People movement of the 70s. Several of the pioneers relax and sing their songs together in the comfort of the Forest Falls retreat in the San Bernardino mountains. Their testimonies will move you to tears just as it did them so many decades later. Especially moving are those of Terry Clark, Annie Herring, Matthew Ward, Andre Crouch and Darrell Mansfield. Testimonies that include severe psychosis, drugs, cancer, suicide, despondency, and hopelessness. All these are healed in an instant with the single bowing of the knees and surrender of the heart. There is a time in all of our lives when we need to ""return to Bethel"" just to remember where we came from in these 30-40 years. I refuse to ""look back"", but rather keep my eyes on the prize before me. But while I run the race, it's great to recall the journey and thank the Lord for all He has done these many decades. ""First Love"" is a great title. It not only helps us remember why we come to faith in the first place, and may also be an encouragement for recommitment for those who have left and wish to return. To this we would sing Love Song's first tune on the DVD--""Welcome Back"".",1160092800,7,1188,4.50462962962963
2390919,5,B000AS1Q3W,"I bought this as a gift for my dad.  Our family watched it together--it was really good! It takes a lot of Christian artists and they talk about how they came to find God and what life was like when they first started this music, within a context of the 60's counter-culture.",1152576000,2,275,4.288461538461538
2390920,4,B000AS1Q3W,"At first this appears to be a documentary of the Jesus Movement of the `60s and `70s. It's actually a late `90s reunion of 16 bands and artists interspersed with interview and commentary. This set contains 2 DVDs and 2 CDs. The producers have cleverly made the interviews segue in and out between the songs, so that the 2 CDs, which contain all the song performances, are crystal clear and beautifully produced. That means that while you get all 31 songs on the two CDs, you can also watch the performances with interviews on the DVDs. An included 25 page booklet gives bios on the artists.

Steve Camp and John Fischer offer especially incisive and trenchant observations. Along with reprises of some of the movement's most memorable songs, there are some killer newer ones, most notably Honeytree's ""Pioneer"" from 1990, which longs for airplay. Darrell Mansfield, formerly of Blues Image, is not the first artist to cast Lieber and Stoller's ""Stand By Me"" as a gospel song (Johnny Rivers did so on his album ""Not a Through Street"" for example), but he is equally at home with its blues riffs. Andrae Crouch emerges as a precursor of today's praise movement. Larry Norman never appears, but Randy Stonehill shows a picture of him and they quote one of his songs. This set dates from before the reconciliation of LN and RS, as reported by John W. Thompson in the May/ June 2003 issue of Christian Musician magazine, and now Larry is rereleasing Randy's CDs.

Hopefully this set will lead to the CD reissue of great albums like Randy Matthews' ""Son of Dust,"" Barry McGuire's ""Lighten Up,"" ""Love Song"" and Darrell Mansfield's ""Higher Power."" I'd love to hear these artists' rockier cuts, but for now, here's ""First Love.""

The CDs and DVDs both include these songs:

Love Song: ""Welcome Back,"" ""Two Hands.""

Barry McGuire: ""Happy Road,"" ""Seeds of Love.""

Jamie Owens Collins: ""The Victor,"" ""Seasons of the Soul.""

2nd Chapter of Acts: ""Easter Song,"" ""Which Way the Wind Blows""

Terry Clark: ""Let's Have a Good Time,"" ""Jesus Mighty Fortress.""

Chuck Girard (of Love Song): ""Sometimes Alleluia.""

Annie Herring (of 2nd Chapter): ""My Redeemer.""

Keith Green (tribute on the DVD): ""There is a Redeemer,""

""O Lord You're Beautiful,"" ""Born Again.""

Randy Stonehill: ""King of Hearts,"" ""Abandon Your Heart.""

Darrell Mansfield: ""Million Dollar Feeling,"" ""Stand By Me.""

John Fischer: ""All Day Song,"" ""Jesus Loves Even Me.""

Randy Matthews: ""Didn't He,"" ""Ti Chape.""

Matthew Ward (from 2nd Chapter): ""To the King.""

Paul Clark: ""Abide,"" ""Where Did I Fall Down?""

Honeytree: ""Clean Before My Lord,"" ""Pioneer.""

Andrae Crouch: ""I Don't Know Why (Jesus Loved Me),""

""I Will Lift Up Mine Eyes,"" ""Bless His Holy Name.""",1132185600,82,2702,4.973273942093541

2390936,5,B000AS1Q3W,"For those of us who were there near the beginning (Simi Valley1970 for me), these tunes drove my college community.  Each singer/group plays an early signature tune, is interviewed, and then plays a second song (most of which were new at the time of this video).  The visuals of the singing is mostly panning around a room of the fellow singers in barca-loungers lost in the moment mouthing the words.  Take a hint, turn the lights down low, turn off the phone, get your comfy quilt on the couch, and close your eyes during the songs.  Watching other people do this is obviously not compelling video.  I have just finished DVD-1 and it challenged me to reconsider what passes poorly as CCM today.  The interviews are not rehashing old testimonies, but they start with their commonly known stories and reflect further about their faith walk.  By the end of the first DVD, I wish I was present in person during those three days of taping.  Some ah-ha moments was which congregations were the home ports for the various bands, leaving me think ""So, that's how such and such got linked up with so and so!""",1426032000,3,1101,4.61025641025641

I grew up in England before moving to the USA in 1994 and being able to buy the original LP's from the groups and individuals performing on this release is what helped me continue my walk with the Lord. So I was so pleased to be able to get this set. Hearing how the Lord Jesus brought these people into His kingdom is a real inspiration!

2390957,5,B000AS1Q3W,"My friends and I used to make the long drive down to the circus tents put up by the beach to hear the FREE concerts put on by these groups. They were so contagiously full of joy and deliverance, they changed the lives of me, my siblings, and many in my California Jesus-people generation. I have long wondered what happened to them, if they were still as full of joy as they were then or if they had descended into some jaded state.

It was so good to see them as full of joy and love as ever, as am I, my family, and most of those I know touched by Jesus because of their music. We now live in India with some of our children and grandchildren, trying to share this same joy to anyone who is thirsty. It is so fun to see this same joy cross all cultural barriers, enter into hearts and change families in any culture, as it did ours.

 I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who did not have the chance to live through the Jesus Movement themselves as well as those who want to relive the beginning of it all.",1394409600,3,1009,4.085858585858586

There are also the personal stories of the artists and interviews with their associates of how their faith gave rise to a phenomenon that came to be known as Jesus Music.

This is a truly wonderful event and it would take a cold heart not to be moved by the performances given here.  This document shows these people as they are, and were, with warts and all.

There truly is something for everybody on this DVD.  Yes, it would be nice to have more---other wonderful artists were around during that time and more currently.  I believe people would love more like this.  Our kids have heard this music their whole lives and they like to share it with others (they are 16 and 20.)

They replay their sixties hits and they have some newer ones too, all with sixties themes.

If you were a sixties child, you will love them too.
They are incredible.
Their witnessing was a big influence on my dithering faith, as I heard about the man who came to save.
I bought some for older friends who all love them.

The most famous musician among them, is Barry Mcguire. His hit, Green Green, I remember from the early sixties as  a youngster in South Africa.
The other muscians all shine too. Big Time!

You'll get some real rocking as well as folk, blues and ballads. The more you watch and listen, the more you'll like it.

2390975,5,B000AS1Q3W,"I always begin writing a review by reading the one-star reviews. I am sorry the person didn't actually see the documentary. Larry Norman is sitting with Jesus right now and would most likely be happy with what the message is.

I would like to remark on several aspects of this film: Production, the musicians, the message(s).

First, I'm happy the quality is there. The film is in touch with the times.

Second, The musicians are all in wonderful voice, and just as in love with Christ as ever. They, and their music, all seem to have been enriched by the years walking with Jesus.

This documentary reminded me of my first love. It reminded me that they were all on uncharted waters. What they did, they did for the glory of the Lord they love. I remember those free concerts and how Keith Green WANTED his music copied and sent to anyone who wanted it for free.

This was not a genre that was ""made"". I think that is the part our fellow with the one star may not remember. These all were just seeking God and desiring to see hungry hearts come to know the God who loves them so.

I saw Larry Norman in concert with Randy Stonehill and others. It was also powerful, profound. We must remember who actually thought of this in the first place. I strongly believe Larry would heartily agree, it was God's idea. These are all just vessles.

May Christian music return to the pureness of this time. Or move ahead to a new pureness that reflects the innocence of people just wanting to see God's love shed abroad.

I found myself clapping in my living room, to the music. No one is home. It made me smile, cry, clap and be grateful. It challenged me to ever return to my First Love: Jesus.",1263772800,5,1684,4.392282958199357
2390976,5,B000AS1Q3W,"This DVD is a must own for anyone who has been transported into the Heavenly Throne Room of God on the wings of contemporary worship. All the pioneers are here, including The Voice, Matthew Ward. I cried through much of it due to the powerful presence of Lord. He still inhabits the praise of his people!",1236038400,4,304,4.446428571428571
2390977,4,B000AS1Q3W,"I listened to all of these artists as a young christian, and through the years.  They are great examples and leaders in the Jesus Music period.
The only person who I think they should include on this recording would be Phil Keaggy.  Not sure if they asked & he refused, but he certainly was as influential as these folks.
Not to lessen the impact of these artists, but Phil is still recording great music.",1235520000,4,405,4.45945945945946

2390979,5,B000AS1Q3W,"i am a little younger than the ""hippie generation"" but my mom introduced me to this video. i grew up in church, so i had heard some of the songs before, for instance ""sometimes hallelujah"".  i really enjoyed watching this video, and i love listening to the cds.  i don't usually like the talking parts of these types of videos, but i really loved listening to the musicians tell their stories of how jesus saved them from the lives that they were leading.  what i love most about the singers and their music is their simplicity. they didn't know much about established religion.  all they knew was that they loved jesus and he loved them.  i already had a cd by chuck girard, and i remembered randy stonehill from the early eighties and his song ""gods of men""  i think this cd is definitely worth buying. it's a true testament of how jesus wants to reach out to the lost, and that he can use anyone who is willing. i also think it has a good message to young people which is to find the gifts that god has given them and use them - your age shouldn't keep you from being used by god. these people were mostly in their teens and early 20s when they were being used by god to touch a whole generation. this generation needs a ""jesus movement"" - (for more on that, you should check out jonathan stockstill's new cd ""deluge"").",1231632000,2,1322,4.331983805668016
2390980,1,B000AS1Q3W,"Every time I have seen or started to view this reunion piece, I have told myself that maybe I will see something that justifies its production without the proper focus on Larry Norman and his immeasurable contribution to this genre of music... but I do not.  Though he was probably not too terribly preoccupied with himself and his work being intentionally shunned by the CCM crowd (a commercialized, mega-industry he had hoped his music would not lead to), everyone else should be.

That intentional and painfully obvious snubbing of Larry Norman alone makes this collection fall completely off of my list, relegating it to little more than a record of a select group of industry insider's private taping session as they reminisce and perform some of their own past works for each other.  Sure, there is the occassional, ""Oh, yeah, I remember that."" or ""I wish they were still a part of the music scene."" but those observations are too few and far between.

No thanks, I'll pass.",1222041600,8,980,4.815476190476191
2390981,4,B000AS1Q3W,"I bought this dvd set for my dad for Father's Day. He loved it, and was pretty emotional through some of the testimonies. It is a great gift for anyone who has an interest in Jesus music.
Each person shares his/her personal testimony, and then presents a couple of songs. Most of them sang old familiar hits. They also did a presentation about Keith Green, which included some old home videos and a soundtrack of a song I wasn't familiar with.
I missed a few stars, including Michael Omartian and Phil Keaggy (although both answered a few questions in separate interviews). I would have enjoyed seeing them perform some of their early hits as well. All in all, I highly recommend this set!",1216598400,2,689,4.609756097560975

I have the 2 CD's in my car right now, listening and singing along.  Great music from a great era.  I was a teenager in the late 60's and early 70's.  This music caused a big uproar in the mainstream church at the time.  I listen now and think how mellow and message filled it really is.  Why did adults of the time ever ""disapprove"" of it?  I was new, and it was different - and it was great.  Still is !!!",1483660800,,580,3.888888888888889
