8443845,5,B000DZU0ES,"I am not sure if this was created in 1997 or simply released in 1997, but at any rate, this is the most upbeat and happpy show I have ever seen. The love and closeness in this family of talented musicians is remarkable and charming.  The enthusiasm and pure joy that Shoji projects throughout this show - or any other of his performances for that matter - is absolutely uplifting and addictive!  His backup band is multi-talented, the dancing is superb.  Their rendition of ""Yellow Bird"" and the Conga segment is worth owning this video on it's own merits!
I just wish this vhs tape were available in CD format as my VCR machine is about to bite the dust!

Mr Tabuchi is, in my opinion, a National Treasure!  IF you want to experience a long-lasting dose of happiness and a genuine mood-lifter, buy this video!",1281830400,,810,4.52054794520548
