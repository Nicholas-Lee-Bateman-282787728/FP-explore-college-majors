8028914,5,B0002LFJIK,"Loved this cartoon when i was a kid so I decided to own it on DVD. Of coarse it does not match up with the DVD quality now since it is an old cartoon, but the movie was flawless with no defects. It comes with a few extra cartoons also which is a plus.",1334448000,,251,3.6666666666666665
