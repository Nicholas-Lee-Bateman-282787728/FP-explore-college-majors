2213150,4,B0007IO77W,"I managed to catch this on Turner Movies one night and loved it.  The interplay between Ted Healy & the Stooges is good.  The storyline is at times, very weak.  But it shows the building of the Stooges.  Least we not forget that there were FOUR Stooges in this film!  Fred Sanborn was the ""silent"" Stooge and at times I wanted him to do more than whisper and wiggle his eyebrows.

Do I recommend the film?  YES for any Stooge fan!  IT IS A MUST!

Now MGM, get off yer cans and release ""Meet The Baron""!",1113868800,6,502,4.145833333333333
2213151,4,B0007IO77W,"This is the first 3 Stooges film ever made! The Stooges & Ted Healy were a Vaudeville stage act that went to Hollywood in hopes of making movies.

While Ted is one of the starring characters, the Stooges are merely supporting players that pop in from time to time (and there are long stretches without them).  The boys play firemen (foreshadowing their later shorts) who have nothing to do with the plot.  At one point Ted hears a siren and walks away from the story-line to go see the firemen.  The Stooges are joy-riding on the firetruck with some girls, going to Coney Island.  Ted hops along for a ride, and then leaves the Stooges when they pass a restaurant that the story-line is taking place at.  We wish we could go along with the Stooges to Coney Island and leave Ted and the story.

SHEMP HOWARD is the third Stooge in this movie, he was the original part of the Vaudeville act ""Ted Healy and his Stooges""(and a few other names they went by) before leaving the group to pursue his own acting career in the movies.  Curly was to replace him on stage and in the Stooges later movies, but Shemp would rejoin the team after Curly's stroke.

MOE HOWARD (using his middle name HARRY in this film) and LARRY FINE are the other Stooges to TED HEALY's mischief.  FRED SANBORN, a comedian who never speaks in this film, is sort of Ted's forth Stooge.  He does not interact with Moe, Larry, or Shemp as a team, he only performs alone or along with Ted.  Fred's heavy silent film make-up makes him look comically out of place.  Watch for a young BILLY BARTY about midway through the film, doing acrobatics with a beachball!

This rare first appearance of the Stooges was almost lost.  30 some years ago nobody was interested in preserving the unstable Nitrate Negative until the Three Stooges Fan Club raised the money in the mid 1970's.  Fortunately a Safety Film negative was made in time, the original Nitrate Negative deteriorated shortly after.  A historic piece of film could have been lost if it were not for the fans!

The early sound-on-film editing is a bit awkward and makes the film feel choppy on scene cuts. But the early sound track is quite clear, unlike many early sound films.  The picture is also very sharp with good contrasts.  There are some occasional jumps in the picture, and brief light film scratches pop up now and then, but the presentation is quite good.

One disappointment is the lack of extras, other than a trailer for FOX's other Stooges film ""SNOW WHITE and the THREE STOOGES"".  This being historically important as their first film, there should have been some interviews with family members (sons & daughters are still alive), and film historians relating the history of this film.

There is also some confusion about whether this film has been colorized, it has NOT.  There is a typographical error on the back of the DVD case, in a box with the year and running time, stating that the film is in color.  THIS FILM IS PRESENTED IN ITS ORIGINAL BLACK & WHITE VERSION.

***If you are looking for classic Three Stooges Curly antics, look elsewhere!***
This is the original ""TED HEALY AND HIS STOOGES"" team.  It is a bit different from the Classic Columbia Shorts.

But it is a MUST HAVE FOR ANY TRUE, SERIOUS, THREE STOOGES FAN!!!!",1112659200,73,3266,4.59412780656304

2213187,3,B0007IO77W,"Ted Healy was more worse than Curly Joe Derita.

I respect ted anyway because if it weren't for him, even though on stooges bios he was a drunk, they would've been NO 3 stooges.

Hard to say, i read that moe never finish school as a boy, because he was obsessed with acting.

Even though TED Healy passed away though a bar fight. If it weren't for that then who knows if Moe wouldve ever took over the stooges???",1440028800,,412,4.189873417721519
2213188,5,B0007IO77W,"A TRULY FUN Three Stooges movie. They are not the stars but supporting players. And Moe is here ""Harry"" and you get to see Shemp before his decision to leave the act -- which debuted on Columbia with  Curley. Most fascinating is the first scene where Stooge ""boss"" Ted Healy tries to have a stage sandbag fall on the singing stooges from above. This scene was duplicated on a widely seen You  Tube of the old Ed Wynn Show in the early 1950s which features the stooges with Shemp. Ted Healy, who died you, is utterly superb. He oozes stage presence and star charisma. Print quality is excellent. I love early sound comedies and although this one is a musical, of sorts, its more comedy. Its written by cartoonist Rube Goldberg -- and that's evident. I think all Stooges Fans MUST own this (or you get a poke in the eye) as should any fans (like me) who watch, study and even collect old early sound comedies (get 'em while they last because they will go out of print)",1435881600,2,966,4.391061452513966

Highly recommended.,1404432000,,344,4.948275862068965
2213193,4,B0007IO77W,"Ted Healy (1896-1937) is this star of this crazy comedy, which is notable for the film debut of the Stooges, namely Shemp Howard, Harry (Moe) Howard, and Larry Fine.  Almost a fourth stooge, Fred Sanborn (1899-1961) plays a fireman who has no spoken dialogue, but whispers things to Ted Healy that only he can hear and understand.  With his bushy eyebrows and funny walk, Fred's antics make him the strangest character in this film, which is really saying something!  Reuben ""Rube"" Goldberg (1883-1970), best remembered as a cartoonist and creator of crazy contraptions, wrote the screenplay for this film, and it shows.  Not only is his wacky burglar alarm and other inventions featured throughout the movie, the plot itself bounces around like a rubber ball in a Rube Goldberg maze.  One of the best scenes in the film is the Stooges singing ""You'll Never Know What Tears Are"" in its entirety, while Fred Sanborn's character tries unsuccessfully to drop sandbags on their heads.  The other notable scene is the firemen's ball, when Ted Healy and the Stooges perform routines from their vaudeville act.  Clocking it at 71 minutes, this cinematic craziness was over quickly, and left me shaking my head as to what I just watched.  I'm happy that this film was restored and released on DVD since, as I read elsewhere, it was almost lost forever.",1386028800,,1344,4.889867841409692
2213194,5,B0007IO77W,"This movie is really great. Not only does it show the Stooges in their movie beginnings, but a lot of good slapstick humor all around. Probably not funny to todays supposed comedy'' standards'', but real clean funny stuff. Good purchase.",1366416000,,237,4.95
2213195,1,B0007IO77W,"This movie is a real bomb.  I couldn't watch the entire thing it was so bad.  Its only value is to show how the Stooges got their start as extras under Ted Healy. Just for that fact, it's worth having.

The silent 'comedian' in this picture is anything but funny, and Healy himself bombs big-time.  The only character who seems at ease with his part is Shemp Howard.

You could chalk up the poor quality to the fact that talkies were still in their infancy; but then again, the Marx Brothers were doing screen comedy quite well at the same time.

The seller is to be commended for offering this DVD at rock-bottom price.  It is indeed rock-bottom! :)",1314835200,3,650,4.411764705882353
2213196,4,B0007IO77W,"Once you get past the fact that this is a Ted Healy and Charles Winninger movie and not a Three Stooges movie, you'll be able to appreciate it on its own merits.

Winninger gives the best performance, playing an easy-going but proud costume store owner suffering a financial reversal.  The scene where him and restauranteur Gus Klein (played by George Bickel) share a bottle of ""something stronger"" is a nice comment on the public attitude toward prohibition.  Healy's character may seem like a politically incorrect bully, but his girlfriend ""Queenie"" is every bit his equal in verbal fisticuffs.

As for the Stooges, you can see where they were heading, but weren't quite there yet.  But their bits, based on their vaudeville routine, were amusing--particularly those at the Fireman's Ball.  As for ""Fourth Stooge"" Fred Sanborn, his part is the oddest, a whispering fireman with a silly way of running who is always to late getting on the fire truck.  However he gives a fine musical performance that more than acquits his being there.

This is not great cinema, or even a great Three Stooges movie.  However it is a a pleasant film, a somewhat nostalgic look at the America of 80 years ago, and all-in-all, a worthwhile viewing experience.",1279065600,6,1242,4.904306220095694
2213197,4,B0007IO77W,"The first thing to understand about this DVD is that, although it is promoted to Three Stooges fans, this is really a 1930 movie in which Moe (not even called that at this stage!), Larry and Shemp are bit players in pre-Three Stooges days. It is most interesting in terms of the evolution of the Stooges, and indeed the evolution of film itself. Bear in mind, this is only two or three years after the first talkie, and it is evident that microphone technology is still in its infancy. Actors dare not wander too far away from wherever the microphone is hidden, for fear they will not be picked up. In one or two scenes on larger sets (e.g., in the fire house), there is a certain hollowness. Bearing all this in mind, the quality of the sound -- and, indeed, the picture -- is terrific.

The Stooges (and there are more than three) are mere adjuncts to the relatively unfunny vaudeville player Ted Healy, whose ""stooges"" they originally were. He is one of the stars of the movie, but the Stooges aren't. One wouldn't get this DVD as an example of the Stooges' work, but for its historical value only. And in that context, it is a very good buy indeed. It is a pity that there are no extras; a commentary track by a knowledgeable film buff would have been valuable. It is also a pity that the packaging designer seems to have thought that this is either a colour or a colourised movie. The cover photos have been colourised; the movie certainly has not.

As with most comedy films of this period, there is very little plot to speak of, just a series of connected gags, and the connections are often tenuous. Such as it is, the script is by the legendary Rube Goldberg, better known for his cartoons featuring impossibly complicated ""inventions"" designed to do stuff that was actually quite simple.

By all means buy this item. I think it's quite good value, but be aware of what it is -- and what it isn't.",1255996800,4,1906,4.455587392550143
2213198,4,B0007IO77W,"Well, folks, I dunno' . . .  maybe I'm just a little nutty myself, but I really like this film.  For the record, I also like the movie ""Meet the Baron"" and a couple of the Fox Laurel & Hardy movies; on the other hand I think ""Dancing Lady"" is very BORING, and I think ""Swing Parade"" is BEYOND boring and a terrible waste of talent, especially in the finale.  So that's where I stand...

~  ~  ~

The slap-dash manner of throwing in everything AND the kitchen sink is very entertaining to me.  After all, the script was a Rube Goldberg construction, and I don't think it lets us down as such.  Oddly, I did not care for the kitchen sink element of ""Hellzapoppin"", a contrived affair, whereas ""Soup to Nuts"" just seems breezily convoluted.

The story moves along briskly with one colorful character popping up after another, and the jokes doggedly marching along.  If you don't like one gag, you'll laugh at the next.  Well, smile anyway...  Happily enough, there are indeed a number of Rube Goldberg's ""inventions"" on display throughout the film.

The Three Stooges appear suddenly in the first shot of the movie, and the whole scene is very funny.  They sing and do the sand-bag routine that they would reprise in the 1950s on the Ed Wynn Show.  Here it is more logically framed and much better timed with a stronger ending.  I find Ted Healey very charming and funny, too.  His girlfriend (Frances McCoy) is perfect: darling and hilarious, and remains one of the great mysteries of film--absolutely nobody seems to know whatever happened to her!

The quality of this film is GREAT, both image and sound.  Imagine: a 1930 movie that no one cared about, saved at the last minute and looking so good.  OK, it's just not a ""great"" film, so 4 stars out of 5; but the restoration is 5 stars.  (One curiosity is that the end music is quite long, but there is no picture!)",1249689600,,1865,4.504477611940299
2213199,5,B0007IO77W,"This is a must have for every Stooge Fan. Most people didn't know that the Three Stooges was a side act that Ted Healy had to get more laughs. Ted Healy is truly the Fourth Stooge and It's great to see some of their stage act seeing how my Dad wasn't even born yet.

The Three Stooges isn't the main act in this DVD. The stooges just appear from time to time but it's well worth the wait. To see how life was back then and what we have today is cool to see as well. Do your Stooge fan a favor and buy them this DVD.",1239148800,,515,3.8130841121495327
2213200,2,B0007IO77W,"If you love zany slapstick from the early years, you might enjoy bits and pieces of this melange of madness: you've got firehouses, costume shops, crazy inventions, restaurants, all as backdrops for alot of frantic antics. One thing is certain: there's exactly *one* funny line of dialogue and it's nice that Larry Fine has it. I won't spill the beans (or the nuts).
This is really a showcase for Ted Healey, a real showman with an impressive baritone singing voice and a knack for off-mike muttering (once in a while something mildly amusing is audible). Of course, he's the original Stooge Supervisor but in this 1930 movie he and ""the boys"" do not have much time together on film. Harry [aka Moses/Moe], Shemp, and Larry, have alot of nutty business, but without the benefit of technology, meaning the kind of editing and sound-effects available later in the decade from the one company that could really put together a slapstick short - Columbia, they sometimes get lost in the din.
Stooges fans and historians can get a strong sense of the Stooges live on stage from this awkward entry.
A big problem is that practically every character is supposed to be funny, including one called ""Whispering Willie"", a ghoulish little figure (who also manages to play a mean zylophone!) who has one decent gag in the latter half of the film. His part is overdrawn - it's like watching a Keystone Kop pratfall every twelve seconds. Also, there's an ill-conceived scene involving a burning building and people in need of rescue. The actors continue to wisecrack while lives are at stake. Bad stuff.
Also for Stooge-philes, there are plot elements which one could reasonably assume found their way onto later classics like ""False Alarms"" and ""Flat-Foot Stooges""; later, for a few bits on The Ed Wynne Show.",1171152000,2,1795,4.869281045751634
2213201,4,B0007IO77W,"Watching this film, it's hard to believe that once not so long ago it was first considered lost and then thought to be beyond the point of saving in its entirety.  The restoration team did a super job, and the final product proves yet again how very important film restoration is.  Sure this film isn't exactly a classic or a great movie, but film restoration is about saving all films, both classics and ordinary movies.  It also helps that this movie is historically very important, even if it's not that great.  One should also consider that most films from 1930 aren't considered classics today, let alone even remembered, because of how new talking pictures were and how crude, primitive, and stilted many of them appeared in comparison to silent films that had been being made just a few short years ago.  And speaking of early sound films, the sound itself in this film does sometimes have that awkward crude feel that a lot of other early talkies do.  However, given that this film was produced by Fox, a studio whose sound recording system was considered far superior to the ones used by RKO and Warner Brothers (so much so that the studio made a lot of money loaning it out to other studios), it might more logically be argued that the less than smooth sound quality might be due to how this film was considered lost and unsalvagable for so long, something that couldn't be fixed in the same way as a deteriorated pictorial quality.

The plot itself is little more than fluff.  Ted Healy, the star of the picture, spends more time hanging around with his buddies at the fire department (Shemp, Moe, Larry, and Freddie Sanborn, a strange character who might best be described as a weirder version of Harpo Marx) than at his real job, whatever that might be (we're never exactly told what).  He's also friends with Otto Schmidt, who runs a costume store that's gone bankrupt and is being taken over by Richard Carlson, who falls in love with Louise, Schmidt's young niece.  Ted's obnoxious girlfriend Queenie also works at the shop, and is constantly telling Louise everything, even when it's bad news she's been warned by Ted to shield Louise from.  Through some behind-the-scenes dealings, Ted and Carlson take actions to save Schmidt's store, though with all of the crazy goings-on in this movie, the store's future might not be so rosy after all.

Most people today are only going to be interested in this film for the screen debut of the Three Stooges, who aren't in all of the scenes.  The real star is Ted Healy, their original straight man and leader.  This film might not be very funny or even very good, but that doesn't subtract from the fact that the guy had a natural screen presence and a whole lot of talent.  It's not fair to judge him by just this one film, particularly when most people alive today didn't get a chance to see him in vaudeville, where he was a huge star.  Knowing about his success in vaudeville gives one a background in why he did have such a huge reputation and why he went on to become such a successful and highly-paid supporting comedian after he transitioned to the screen.  Unfortunately he's gotten a very bad reputation over the years; he wasn't a perfect little angel, but he was also far from the complete monster and talentless shill that a lot of people routinely make him out to be without even knowing all of the facts.  This film is also our only real chance to see what the vaudeville routine of Ted Healy and His Stooges (in their original lineup) looked like, in the scene at the costume party where they're entertaining the crowd.  Another highlight of the film is that the women playing the Stooges' girlfriends whom they go to Coney Island with were their real-life wives, and that they weren't acting when they were on that fire truck.  It's also a bit shocking to see how young they look in this film; Larry in particular (the youngest member of the original lineup by some years) looks really fresh-faced and doesn't even have his trademark haircut.  Actually, none of them have their trademark haircuts in this picture!

This isn't a great movie, and it didn't get too many laughs from me, but it is historically important, and it does have more than a few good scenes in it.  It may largely seem like little more than a curio, but at least it's not a boring curio.  It's also one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings.",1156032000,,4406,4.612035851472471
2213202,5,B0007IO77W,"I've wanted to see this film for quite awhile, and I must say, I wasn't let down! This film is a riot. The plot isn't strong, but it doesn't need to be. Between early forms of Stoogery, Fred Sanborn's silent and musical antics (I may even be willing to argue he stole the show), Ted Healy's 'relationship' with an obnoxious girlfriend, and the 'Hat Tipping' device, this movie is more than just a good movie for a Stooge fan, but for anybody that likes the comedy of old. Jus' git it.",1121558400,4,484,4.329670329670329
2213203,4,B0007IO77W,"This last review was helpful to me as I was going crazy trying to figure out why the dvd jacket states the film is in color, the pictures of the Stooges are all in color, and even other posts on the web misstate this.

The film is in glorious black and white, but the negative is sharp and the images clear. The sound too is remarkable for a film of this age. The actors are hokey, the girls cute in that Betty Boop fashion, and the Stooges - well, what can you say about perfection?

Kudo's to the Stooge society for raising the money to preserve this little gem back in the 70's. It might have been lost forever otherwise.

Watching the Stooges is always reason to celebrate (the release of Snow White and the 3 Stooges (feat. Joe DeRita) is also a magnificent film (and yes, that one is really in color!)

So what do we have ? One of the Stooge's first and one of their last , released in pristine quality to enjoy for the ages.

 One last thing...I could never understand the appeal of Ted Healey and always resented the fact that he was such a no talent slapping OUR boys around and generally mistreating them. With Soup to Nuts, I see no reason to change that assessment. I'm glad that history (and the common sense of the Stooges) finally kicked his no-talent butt to the curb, and continued into cinema history and our hearts as the act we all grew up loving!",1116288000,6,1367,4.299610894941634
2213204,4,B0007IO77W,"At long last, ""Soup To Nuts"" finally sees the light of day, and the very long wait was well worth it! This film is an absolute must for Three Stooges fans as it was the true beginning of the Stooges as an act, even though Shemp, Larry & Moe were playing second fiddle to Ted Healy at the time.

For years, rumors circulated that the last surviving prints of ""Soup To Nuts"" had deteriorated to the point of no return and would never be released on video, but you wouldn't know it by viewing this. There are a couple of jerks and jumps here and there, but overall, the print quality is great.

This film would probably not interest Curly enthusiasts since it features Shemp as the third stooge; this was shortly before he left the act and Curly joined. Actually, the Stooges don't appear until about 15 minutes into the film, and the first appearance of the boys singing the often-used song ""You'll Never Know"" is included here in it's entirety. Along with it is the sandbag dropped from the ceiling gag, which was later reprised by the Stooges on the Ed Wynn Show in 1950.

It's been a long wait for this to become available and the price is definitely right, so go out and get it!",1115164800,23,1180,4.378995433789954
2213205,3,B0007IO77W,"The only reason that anyone would want to see this is the fact that it has the first film appearance of the Ted Healy & the Three Lost Souls (later the 3 stooges). Not terribly amusing. Mostly a variation of the shopworn ""mortgage on the farm"" (in this case, store)  where Ted healy's brash and obnoxious girlfriend works (these two make a good match, trust me). Shemp, Larry, and Moe are firemen who have little to do other than a few amusing fire sequences (more about them in a minute). It's never exactly clear why Ted Healy drops what he's doing and joins the stooges whenever they go to fight a fire, but, oh well.

Stoogephiles may want to skip ahead to track 18. This is where Ted Healy and the Stooges go into their vaudeville act to entertain guests at a costume party (thus the strange outfits on the cover of the DVD). This is fascinating for the Stooge fan. We see the early slapping slapstick, a routine that was later revamped with Curly in ""Plane Nuts"" three or four years later, and a really funny gag about ""The Elevator Dance"" that caps it all off. The value of this is not only the fact that it's the earliest filmed record of the Stoogery that was to come, but it's the only known film of the original Stooge stage act BC (Before Curly). The Stooges' actual wives also appear in the dance scene that occurs after this bit and an earlier fire truck sequence.

Rube Goldberg, who is best remembered for his cartoons of bizarre contraptions and inventions, wrote the script and it shows. The bizarre burglar alarm, the hat-tipping device, and the machine that puts sugar lumps in coffee are gags that largely fall flat to the modern viewer.

But as an early example of filmed stoogery, it's worth the low pirce. Good as a curio and collector's item, but unless you have a lot of friends who are hardcore stoogephiles or trivia geeks, don't invite the crowd over for beer and pizza for this one.",1114214400,20,1912,4.485632183908046
