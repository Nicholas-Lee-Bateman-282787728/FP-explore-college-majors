4464844,5,B004SUDQ36,"This movie jumps around so much, everyone I know that has watched it has a different opinion of what the movie is even about. And with Ryan who could not love this movie!!",1156982400,2,171,4.212121212121212
4464845,2,B004SUDQ36,"Where did this movie come from ? Was it a theatrical release? I stumbled upon this by accident. I thought it would be a stinker and I was right! Ryan P. has only played in two movies I have  liked and that was ""Way of the Gun"" and ""Cruel intentions."" This movie tries too hard to be a weird psycological thriller. Which the only thing it does is dance around a cut close easy subject. The movie's payoff could have been explained in 30 min. Just like that movie Abandon. I hate movies like that, there aren't many David lynch's out there. Trust me, this isn't worth it after u watch this once in the garbage it goes. This isn't a deep thriller at all. The end is basically nothing surprising, nothing u couldn't write on ur own. The movie is loaded with flashbacks ! This and ""The Jacket"" are almost the same movie ! Only this throws a little violent twist in it . I am the king of psycological thrillers and this one is junk ! Probably why this is so far  under the radiar !",1133740800,14,975,4.180851063829787
4464846,3,B004SUDQ36,"Ryan Phillippe (Crash (2005), Cruel Intentions) plays a man who awakens from a hospital bed and finds out that he was dead for 2 minutes. He also thinks that its the year 2000 in which it is not, it seems he lost memory of the last 2 years, so it is now 2002. So, Phillippe is left to recover from his accident and he finds out that his brother, played by Robert Sean Leonard (Last Days Of Disco, Swing Kids) didn't make it. He try to fit the pieces of the puzzle together in his mind and find out what really happened? But as he progesses he goes back in time to 2000, is this his imagination? Was he really in 2000 and did he go back to 2002 or is there something else? Interesting mind teaser story has Phillippe giving one of his best so far. Also starring Sarah Polley (Dawn of the Dead (2004), My Life Without Me), Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly, Lost and Delirious), Stephen Rea (...), Stephen Lang (Gods and Generals) and Stephen Graham (Snatch, Gangs of New York).",1130544000,5,968,4.295081967213115
4464847,2,B004SUDQ36,"This movie has a strong sense of ""Been there, done that before."" No, I'm not talking about the characters, I'm talking about the audience. It's kind of funny, I was reviewing the C-grade horror movie ""Soul Survivors"" the other day, and, perusing the other reviews, everyone seemed to be in agreement that the movie had far too many cheats and poor explanations. In actuality, I think it's just easier to rip apart low-budget horror movies than movies with more ambition, like ""The I Inside,"" because this movie has far more cheats and dead-ends never explained than ""Soul Survivors."" ""The I Inside"" also attempts to do far more than ""Soul Survivors,"" with much loftier aims, so it fails in a more spectacular way.

""The I Inside"" stars Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Polley, Piper Perabo, Robert Sean Leonard, and Stephen Rea. The casting is good, I think. First of all, I don't think Ryan Phillippe can play an out-and-out good guy. Even when he tries to cover it, he just comes off and looks like an obnoxious brat. It's really not his fault, but it's there. But in this movie, his casting works, because he is a privileged, rich... well, brat, for lack of a better term who may not be the nice guy that he seems... if you think that's a clue he's really bad though, you'd be wrong too. As for the rest of the cast, I like them. Sarah Polley has slipped a little in recent years, but looking over her body of work she is still one of the most impressive actresses of her age, I think. Stephen Rea is great in pretty much whatever he does, and Leonard is a guy I liked since ""Dead Poets Society"" and recently reaffirmed his talent in the surprising ""Tape."" Piper Perabo is surprisingly good too - I'd like her in a shallow sort of way from some of her movies like ""Lost And Delirious,"" but was not overly impressed.

Anyway, the story goes - Phillippe's character, Simon Cable, awakens from a horrible accident. He thinks it's 2000, but in actuality, it's 2002. He seems to have amnesia about quite a number of things. His doctors tell him it looks like he may have been poisoned. He meets his wife, she leaves, he finds out she's not his wife, and meets another woman, his ""real"" wife, and finds out she may not be what she seems either. Then a vanishing medic tries to kill him, and from there things get truly weird. To go on would be to divulge too many spoilers.

The problem with this movie is two-fold. One, it's something a bad mix of ""Memento,"" ""The Butterfly Effect,"" and even ""Soul Survivors,"" and ""Mulholland Drive,"" yes. It's like a hasty grab-bag of altered reality movies/limited knowledge movies. In movies like these, you pretty much have a good idea of how things are going to unfold. You figure the things that seem intentionally confusing are going to be revealed when the movie ends and the viewer is able to connect the dots. Within the first couple of lines spoken by the doctor, you have a good idea of what the kicker is going to be. Then you go through the movie and think, ""wait, that's far too childishly obvious, it can't be that, if it was *that*, then there would be a ton of stuff unaccounted for."" Well guess what? Surprise! It really is *that.* There is a lot unaccounted for. Some critics and reviewers I've seen talking about this movie claim that everything has a good explanation. I disagree. I think if you really, really stretch the narrative beyond the breaking point, and give the creators more benefit of the doubt than you've giving anything in your entire life, you can foist a semi-plausible explanation on just about everything in the movie, but even then there are still glaring miscues. Among them, pointing them out so as not to give spoilers:

#1- The medic trying to kill Cable makes no sense.

#2- What Cable's brother did in the car makes no sense (you know when if you've seen the movie, it's the only thing of import he does in the car).

#3- What if the time was, say, 1:57 a.m. instead? What then? You'd have a mess, that's what.

All in all, maybe I'd recommend this movie as an exercise in getting a delicious little visceral thrill of being cheated or frustrated, or trying to play a game of fix the cinematic Rubik's Cube and try and account for all the problems and tidy up the explanation of the movie, but on its own merits, I cannot recommend ""The I Inside,"" despite nice performances by the cast.",1128211200,23,4355,4.526048284625158
4464848,4,B004SUDQ36,"I really liked this movie, however I liked its soundtrack even more and can't seem to find it or what the music is anywhere.  Does anyone have any information on how I can find it?  I would appreciate your help.",1114905600,,211,4.25
4464849,5,B004SUDQ36,"THE I INSIDE is a very fine film that deserves a wide audience.  It ranks up there with 'MEMENTO', 'THE SIXTH SENSE', and 'JACOB'S LADDER' as the sort of intelligent film that demands intensive participation on the part of the viewer to catch all of its nuances and possible plot variations.

Based on a play Michael Cooney who also wrote the screenplay and directed with considerable finesse by Roland Suso Richter, the story involves a bizarre mix of altered circumstances surrounding the hospitalization  of Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe in a performance that is the finest of his career and promises much more from this actor) whose circumstances for awakening under the care of one Dr Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) are nebulous. Dr Newman who slowly reveals to Simon that he is suffering from acute memory loss due to trauma and possible poisoning (he had undergone cardiac arrest and was resuscitated) and yet warmly reassures him he will soon return to normal.  In essence Simon has 'lost' two years of his life, finding through the blur of amnesia that he has a wife Anna (Piper Perabo) who secretly reveals to him that there is a murder in his history that is part of an evil 'plan'.  He also encounters Clair (Sarah Polley) who claims they are lovers.  Simon is informed that his brother Peter (Robert Sean Leonard) is dead: Anna supports the premise that Simon killed him.  The ingredients of the mystery of the lost two years are set in motion.

The connection between the past in 2000 and the 'present' in 2002 is slowly revealed in mind-boggling flashbacks and re-runs of possibilities: apparently the misdeeds of 2000 included an auto accident which resulted in Simon's hospitalization in the very place he finds himself in 2002 and in which his brother Peter died.  Tense confrontations and secrets begin to surface and even the concept that if we re-enter our past we can change the future is presented convincingly.  Yet how this all plays out is the magic of this fine film.  There are so many avenues that could represent the 'true story' of Simon's life and his amnesia-altered past two years that it is truly up to the viewer to decide how this film ends!

The performances are all fine: Ryan Phillippe is superb, capturing all facets of this deluded young man and finding the strength of character in his Simon portrayal that makes us willing to identify with him at every turn.  The photography by Martin Langer is moody and atmospheric without resorting to the usual fright tactics.  The musical score by Nicholas Pike enhances every frame.  But it is the terse direction of Richter that makes this thriller sail into the ranks of the truly fine films of this genre. Grady Harp, March 05",1112227200,30,2708,4.7935483870967746

4464851,5,B004SUDQ36,"Considering that cast, I didn't expect too much.  That all changed about one minute into the movie.  I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and did not take my eyes off the screen the entire time, literaly staring, waiting to see what happens. Every part of this movie seems to make you try and figure it out.  Even if you think you know what's going on, you don't.

  The idea of the movie is Ryan Phillipe(sp?) is in a car accident and gets amnesia, coincidentaly he cannot remeber the past two years.  While he is trying to piece the past together, you're right there with him, starting from scratch, not knowing anything about the past two years.  I have never seen a movie that can actually make me feel the same disorientation that the main charactor feels here, but that's a good thing. I heard Stephen Dorff was supposed to play the main charactor originally, in my oppinion, there is no way he could make you relate to this charactor nearly as well as Phillipe did.

All in all, a very pleasent suprise, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys thinking when they watch a movie.",1106784000,5,1111,4.46039603960396

The Anna and Claire characters didn't stand up to his performance, as their acting was mediocre at best - but it doesn't take away from the film. It's a well written story - thriller says it well because I was on the edge of my seat. Home alone, 9pm, I don't usually do these types of films. I couldn't tear my eyes away.

8440278,1,B004SUDQ36,"Someone had already taken the title ""Spoiler Alert"".  Bottom line, the dude is dead and constantly reliving his life past, present and future in a sort of limbo.  I kept watching, thinking that it might go somewhere, but the story just kept repeating itself, like if Wes Craven had produced Groundhog Day.  It's one of those once is enough film viewings. God forbid when I die that I'll have to watch this movie over and over again.  After a while, you just get tired of the back and forth from the past to the present to the imangined future (there actually was no future, as he died at the scene of the accident).",1380672000,3,615,4.415929203539823
8440279,3,B004SUDQ36,"Imagine waking up in the hospital after an accident, not knowing what happened, and then realizing that it's two years later than you thought it was. That is the dilemma faced by Simon Cable in The I Inside. This ambitious thriller has you piecing together the puzzle along side it's star Ryan Phillippe. The I Inside jumps around, far too much, between past, present, and future to tell it's story, a story that you really won't care about. It's a very uninteresting tale, that is told to you a piece at a time and to be honest, that's why you watch the film. It's confusing and not very good, but once you've invested the time, you want to know what happens. Ryan Phillippe was Brilliant as Simon Cable, proving that it really isn't all about the looks, he can act too, but again it's wasted talent in a very uninteresting tale. Phillippe is paired with Sarah Polley, who I absolutely love, the fact that she was in this film, is what put it on my radar, but she easily gives the worst performance of her career. Yes, the story wasn't very well written, but if everyone had put the energy into their roles that Phillippe did, the film would have at least had some credibility. The films Director is Roland Richter, was directing his first film in the United States. I don't know about movies in Germany, but here in the United States, if you're going to release a jumpy, confusing film, you'd had better make the story worth while. Richter fails to do that and the result is a slow, confusing film, that has you asking, ""is that it? Really?"" The I Inside is unique and will make you think, but the story being told, really isn't worth the time it takes to piece it all together.",1368489600,2,1680,4.457792207792208
8440280,4,B004SUDQ36,"I like Ryan Phillippe as an actor. Some of his movies are great (the Lincoln Lawyer being one). He was great in the Direct T/V series ""Damages"" staring Glen Close.

8440281,4,B004SUDQ36,"You Identify with and are as confused as the main character. And that is good. Excellent acting by Ryan Phillippe. Hard role to get right and he does. On par with Jacob's Ladder, one of my favorite movies.",1339891200,,205,4.421052631578948
8440282,2,B004SUDQ36,"Two stars because it held my attention, just trying to figure what the *bleep* is going on. No more than two stars because the ending is ambiguous, and I hate that. OK, maybe this is one of those that relies on some sort of religious faith, but they don't even make that obvious.

Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) wakes up in a hospital as a result of a shock to restart his heart. He's told he's just been in a horrible accident, and lucky to be alive. However, he seems to have lost a couple of years of his memory. But things get terribly complicated pretty quickly. First, two women claim to be his wife, or his mistress, or maybe his wife and his mysterous. Anyway, one is a blonde and the other a brunette, so the audience can tell them apart.

His brother apparently died in the same accident, but the details come in a series of flashes that may be memory or may be some sort of time travel. Did he kill his brother? Was he in love with the blonde or the brunette? Does he ""belong"" in 2000 or 2002? Is someone trying to kill him, or to save his life?

I'm not even going to spoil it by telling you which of these questions get answered and which do not, let alone how the answers come together, like the jigsaw puzzle one doctor uses as a metaphor for his lost memory.

OK, it's not exactly a bad movie, but it's a frustrating one.",1336608000,3,1335,4.203125
8440283,3,B004SUDQ36,"I forgot that I'd watched Roland Suso Richter's ""The I Inside"" so I rented it a second time.  Ryan Phillippe plays Simon Cable, an accident victim who has lost his memory.
