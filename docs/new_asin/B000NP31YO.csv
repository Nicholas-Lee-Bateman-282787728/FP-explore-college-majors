Mae West is presented in her third film, a curiosity about a circus performer who does the lion tamer act on the side (I kid you not!).  This side job eventually leads to fame, fortune, many men, much jewelry, and eventually the biggest prize, the young and handsome Cary Grant.  The story was unusual: it showcased Mae West in a contemporary 30's milieu (her previous picture had been a period film), and the story deals mainly with how she manages her life on her own and her many men, with plenty of innuendo-laden quips throughout. Marriage is not even hinted at for her. She is her own person.  And she actually does say, ""Why don't you come up and see me sometime?""  The funniest sequence is at the climax of the film, when she sues Grant for alienation of affections and takes charge of her own legal proceedings - she makes Shirley Schmidt of Boston Legal look like Minnie Mouse!  Very funny, and truly one of the classic films.

Yet it is very underrated, probably due to the fact that West wrote the film and starred in it. Sexism existed then, and is still prevalent now. This holds up better than many films of its era, due to the frankness of the dialogue and the situations.  Cary Grant is a worthy partner, sparring verbally with West and looking dapper and so young.  He really set a high standard for actors in comedy that few have lived up to since then.

This is definitely a DO NOT MISS! item!",1219363200,,1570,4.473684210526316
