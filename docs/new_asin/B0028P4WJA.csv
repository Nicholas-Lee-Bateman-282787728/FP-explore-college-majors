3872859,4,B0028P4WJA,"First time I've had Debra Mazda and it's simple and easy. No difficult steps and easily modified to burn more by adding arm exercises here and there. Easily performed in the living room or limited space.
Very simple exercises for those who are challenged by lack of co-ordination but personally I prefer to feel like I'm ""dancing"", not just walking.",1269820800,9,349,4.833333333333333
3872860,4,B0028P4WJA,Great video with low impact aerobics for shapely women.  My wife loves the video and the workout.,1267833600,2,97,4.705882352941177
3872861,5,B0028P4WJA,"In the past two years I've lost over a hundred pounds.  I have a home gym with lots of cardio equipment (elliptical, treadmill, rower, recumbent bike,  spinner, step) and free weights, gadgets, bands and pedometers, balls and walking belts, and dozens of workout dvds.  I now bike, kayak, hike, snowshoe and take classes in yoga, Pilates, aqua aerobics and zumba when the spirit moves me.  I also workout with Wii Fit, Wii Cardio Boxing, Outdoor Sports, Biggest Loser.  I have two excellent personal trainers.  I'm very fit -- but I'd still like to lose 40 more pounds.  I love strength training and walking, but some days I don't want weights or the intensity of Jillian Michaels 30 day Shred or Jari's Get Ripped.  Many dvd workouts now incorporate both weights and cardio, which is terrific, but you need recovery days after lifting.

This Shapely Girl workout is just hard enough to make me sweat....but not so hard that I don't want to do it.  It's perfect for someone just beginning to exercise, no matter what her size.  But it's  a worthy workout even for me, though I do heavy interval workouts sometimes 5 days a week!  This is a perfect low-impact cardio workout with no gimmicks.  (I've got lots of ""ten-minute"" workout dvds that are customizable....but I have to THINK to program those and I just want to WORKOUT and be done with it! And don't kid yourself.  You ain't getting fit in ten minutes).

 Debra begins with a brief warmup, then goes into easy side steps, kicks, cha-chas, arm pumps....simple choreography....like a walking workout (I have plenty of those) but NOT boring.  She ends with standing stretches.  Her cueing is excellent and she's upbeat.  Having lost a great deal of weight herself, Debra is sensitive to the fact that you don't have to be doing jump lunges or twisting like a pretzel to feel good and be healthy.  All of the moves are doable for older women or those who are heavy. There are many workouts available for the super fit who are already in shape....but Debra reaches out to those who may feel they can't handle any exercise without huffing and puffing or are too embarrassed to show up at a gym.  And from the statistics I've heard lately, that's most Americans.  The DVD doesn't require a single piece of equipment, though I sometimes add very light ""cardio weights"" that are two pounds.  It  is a fabulous addition to anyone's cardio repertoire.  Debra is motivating and inspiring.  This dvd should be in everyone's library.  Highly recommended!",1265155200,29,2497,4.771028037383178
3872862,5,B0028P4WJA,"I purchased 'Let's Get Moving' with Debra Mazda after reading the very informative reviews here at Amazon - thanks !!
I have previously bought several Leslie Samsone walking DVD's which are OK but some of her workout's are too repetitive and unprofessionally put together and not enough stretching after the walk.
I'm 63 and suffer quite a lot with Arthritic pain in most parts of my body and it's a must for me to exercise and stretch to keep the stiffness and pain under control. None us want to spend our old age relying on pain killers.
Quite frankly I really enjoy Debra's routines which I surprisingly managed to push myself through on the first attempt !! However I've had to persevere with some of the steps to get them right, my aging co-ordination not being very good....
The bonus stretch is fantastic !
I highly recommend this workout for any age group.",1258502400,60,865,4.660130718954249
3872863,5,B0028P4WJA,"I purchased Debra's first 3 DVDs this Spring and her 4th a couple of weeks ago. After I tried this DVD for the first time, I knew it was another instant favorite of hers! I have got to say I really enjoy her and her curvy crew! I am not a beginner exerciser nor am I a very big girl, I'm average- Size 14, age 26, but still broke a sweat. The moves really are very easy to add intensity to if needed. Make the squats power squats, do the ""football drill"" faster, when ""skating"" go faster and add a jump. Really it's very basic choreography and an easy task to accomplish. You seriously get out what you put in, bottom line. I love that on days I have no energy, but just want my fintess experience to bring about a smile and a sense of calm, I go with the flow of the DVD. On days I want a ""Debra"" workout and to be dripping with sweat, I work as hard as I can. In other words, I make it fit me, my goals, and needs for that day.

I really enjoyed the music and the fact that there are women working out getting healthy that actually look close to what I do, or even what I used to look like; I was a size 22 a couple of years ago. We don't have to be a size 2 or even an 8 to be healthy and fit and Debra makes you realize this. It can be hard fitting your Size 14 into a Size 4 World and this DVD shows you that we are the Average, most common size in America, and there is nothing wrong with it! Take care of yourself by eating healthier, exercising, and love yourself, those are the keys...not trying to shrink down! The movements are fun and range from athletic, to dance, to basic marches. I have over 200 DVDs in my collection and had these ones come out before I spent a small fortune, I would have never needed to invest in any additional cardio DVDs!

I love Debra, her message, her motivation, and her workouts! Keep them coming as you have a new loyal fan! Every time I use one of Debra's DVDs, I walk away feeling so good about myself and the effort that I just put forth. I feel like I am on cloud-nine and always do I feel like I got a great workout all while enjoying the experience. That is not something I can say about any other fitness instructor that I have used, and there have been countless of them. I feel so good about her message, that at times, I do get emotional. I know it's perfectly fine to be me and I don't have to change to fit into the societal standards. I am happy, I am fit, and I love Debra's DVDs! Look out Leslie Sansone, you've been replaced in my book!",1251072000,40,2496,4.0
3872864,5,B0028P4WJA,"Debra Mazda is an incredible and inspirational fitness professional. In her workout, she focuses not on working out to be ultra-thin, but working out for the real and true reason, the reason we should all ""Get Moving"" -- for optimal health. Shapely Girl Fitness focuses on plus-sized women without making the incorrect assumption that if a person is over size 6 (or 8, or whatever), then they must be out of shape. Not so, which Debra proves! Her workout is thorough, inspirational, and highly effective.",1245369600,9,504,4.9411764705882355

3872867,5,B0028P4WJA,"Great video for the price and content. You still get a great workout without having to do ridiculous moves. The workouts are geared towards heavier women. No contorting exercises - basic and effective. This is great because some of us larger women still want to exercise but can't quite do the exercises on the ""skinnier"" women's videos.

3872868,5,B0028P4WJA,"Love me some Debra.  We're now facebook friends.  If you call her studio, she just may answer.  Fun workout for the average size woman. It is a challenge, but doable; (not like the woman from the Biggest Loser where you shred your knees during her workouts).  Have this video and 2 others.

Debra cares about you and your fitness, and it shows in this video.  It's not about making a quick buck for her.  Love the discussion she has with women after the workout.  Wish I could take classes from her in Jersey!",1412380800,2,509,4.397849462365591
3872869,5,B0028P4WJA,"there is a variety of exercises for beginners & intermediate which are simple and effective.

3872870,3,B0028P4WJA,"When I saw this DVD called Shapely Girl, I really wanted to like it; I am a little overweight but more importantly, I have knee issues that make a lot of cardio, even low impact, difficult for me.  I thought that this would be just the right level of intensity, and it was; in fact I kicked it up a notch in a few places to increase the intensity in the upper body and get the heart rate up a little more.  What drove me crazy was that the instructor has no idea of how to count out the beat.  I teach yoga and strength training classes myself, so this is a real pet peeve for me...all through this DVD she kept yelling out 2 randomly, sometimes followed by 3, 4, 5 and sometimes not.  It usually wasn't on the second beat that she called out 2 either; it could be anywhere.  Might not bother most people at all but about 10 min. in I was ready to throw the DVD in the garbage.  I got used to it; will continue to use it, and just try to disregard the instructor's obsession with ""2.""",1398384000,6,984,4.046391752577319
3872871,4,B0028P4WJA,I like the fact that I can exercise at home.  It is a big help to me.  Low impact exercise it good for older women or anyone for that matter.  It beats going to the gym and being stared at.,1387152000,2,189,3.675
3872872,4,B0028P4WJA,"I really like this, and I am not a fan of workout videos. You get a workout, but the moves are easy. The women in the video are not stick figures, so it makes you feel like you can do it too.",1381622400,6,191,3.5714285714285716
3872873,4,B0028P4WJA,"I've been working out with ""Sweatin' To The Oldies"" for the past 6 months and needed a little change.  I picked ""Shapely Girl"" because it looked like REAL women working out.  In comparison, I think Debra does a MUCH better job of giving instructions.  It took me quite a while with Richard Simmon's workouts to get the routine down.  Debra gives you a lot of directives and keeps telling you what is coming up next.  It didn't take long to get the routine down.  I also like that I can get the workout done in 30 minutes! I feel like I've done a good cardio in that time!  I'm a beginner - and I can keep up really well.  The basis of the entire workout is marching.  Anyone can march, right?  It's VERY low impact and she helps you figure out how to alternate if you need too.  The filming is good quality, and the music is original.  I have shared this video with my at-work workout group, and they all liked it very much.  Overall, I think it's a winner!",1372982400,8,957,4.220994475138122
3872874,4,B0028P4WJA,Debra Mazda runs a clean ship. The music isn't too loud.  The crew working out are all normal looking ladies with genuine smiles.  I get a decent lower impact workout.  Mazda's routine is easy to follow.  I'm keeping her in mind when I decide to expand the collection again.,1365206400,3,274,4.530612244897959
3872875,4,B0028P4WJA,"I cannot dance; that is no matter with this video. Very easy to use. I have a heart condition that prevents me from doing any intense exercise...this video is perfect for those looking for low impact, easy steps. Will be buying more Debra Mazda videos for sure. She is a good instructor and with larger women doing the steps with her, I enjoyed the workout.",1349049600,,357,4.507692307692308
3872876,5,B0028P4WJA,"This is an empowering, positive, low-impact workout that features a likable and upbeat instructor who never crosses the line into annoying or cloying. The women working out with her are plus-sized, and one of the things I like about this video is that these ladies don't have artificial smiles plastered on their faces for the entirety of the workout: while they do seem to be having a good time, they also puff and pant during some of the more challenging exercises, which makes me feel like I'm not doing anything wrong by puffing and panting.

The moves in this video are not hard overall but it may take a few tries before getting them down well. This workout is fun, challenging, and is likely to have some longevity in your exercise dvd collection due to its usefulness for cardio, the working out of all the major muscle groups, and the length of the workout (almost a half hour long). Debra Mazda does NOT fool around with the exercises.

As someone else said, this may not be ideal for beginners or for those who have been away from exercise for awhile. However, you could do half of the video for a couple of weeks, alternating halves, and work up to doing the entire video later. I am giving this title 5 stars because it's so well done, is challenging enough to be useful to both novice to experienced exercisers, and it is very positive for a demographic about which there are not always kind words or upbeat messages.",1335312000,7,1431,4.56420233463035

I have three Debra Mazda DVDs and love all of them.  I skip the exercises I can't do, and enjoy the ones I can do.

Debra leads a great workout, is lots of fun, and not at all annoying -- unlike other exercise instructors -- even after doing her workouts repeatedly.

I also enjoy her workout with weights, which alternates between low impact cardio and strength training with light weights.  It, like all of her workouts, is easy to do, yet surprisingly effective.  She hits the right note......challenging yet easy to learn, inspiring yet not too preachy, encouraging yet not unrealistic.",1328659200,,813,4.590277777777778
3872878,1,B0028P4WJA,"I was very disappointed in my purchase.  A true ""beginning"", low impact routine is slow-paced, with moves that are not difficult,  or hard on the joints. This routine is fast-paced and requires quick, wide side steps that are painful and possibly damaging for hips and knees not in condition for these moves.

During the workout, I could not  reduce or eliminate moves that were too difficult.  The pace was too fast and I could not keep up.  If you are out of shape, or have reduced joint flexibility, difficulty stretching, or only fair cardio reserve I would NOT recommend this DVD!

That said:  this would be a good beginners' workout ONLY if you are flexible in your hips and legs, have good coordination, timing and strong cardio reserve.",1321660800,16,744,4.7578125
3872879,3,B0028P4WJA,"This video came brand new and in perfect condition. I wish I had watched it before trying to workout with it, and I recommend anyone who buys this does watch it first. The instructor does not explain the movements ahead of time and they are not always easy to follow. However, the music is bright and cheery, and as long as you keep moving you are getting the benefit of the workout anyway, even if your moves aren't quite right. I like Leslie Sansone's walk videos better, but this is a nice change to keep things mixed up.",1318809600,,524,4.357142857142857

3872881,5,B0028P4WJA,"Here are some general impressions first:

The Pros

Debra Mazda is adorable without being annoying. I would love to have an actual class with her.

The women in the video class were a nice diverse group who all had giant smiles and looked like they were genuinely enjoying themselves.

They sweat.

I sweat.

I was able to complete the program.

The music was non-intrusive.

The Cons

I only saw one big one. Debra, while being anti-diet and generally body positive, does sporadically encourage you to burn some calories. While this isn't a huge part of the DVD, it's there. I would much rather have her tell me to ""come on, get stronger.""

Debra lost a significant amount of weight through exercise and has built a fitness career as a result. I felt like her heart was in the right place. She says several times during the DVD and on her website that fitness happens at every size. That message is on her website as well. But it's right along side a video that features women who have lost weight. She has the opportunity to be revolutionary--to leave weight loss out of the fitness equation all together. And she almost does. But for people who are very sensitive to weight loss messages, there could be some triggering.  (I recommend skipping the video on her website if talk of weight loss triggers you.)

Every now and then I come across a resource that could be body positive and fat accepting--except that it throws in a weight-loss message almost as an after thought. As if someone said, you know, more people would buy this if you tell them it will make them thinner, and so they did. But it's not the main message.

This is an old school dance aerobics DVD and Debra reminds me of a hipper, female Richard Simmons. She wants you to love yourself and enjoy moving your wonderful body. She also brings to mind Susan Powter, but in a toned down way. And, she has big giant steps over both of these 1990s gurus in that she doesn't advocate dieting. In fact, she has a no-diet contract on her website.

I am fairly uncoordinated and it takes me a long time to get the hang of dance steps. There were a few minutes where I just marched in place because my arms and legs wouldn't move together that way. For some reason, I really had trouble with the V-step with opening and closing arms. Ruby laughed.

Debra offers some modification, but not much. I would have liked to see more. The whole workout could be done sitting down, using arms only, for people with mobility issues. Or standing with arms or legs only, for those with lower fitness levels. The complicated steps aren't necessary if you can't keep up. You can just march in place to keep your heart rate up until that part is done. I think when you're marketing an exercise DVD to people with larger bodies, it is important to address issues like mobility and differing fitness levels. It seems that in her live classes she does this. I would have loved to have seen one of her class participants doing modified exercises.

One of the problems with aerobics in general, at least in my opinion, is that they are so tightly tied socially and culturally to weight loss. They just are. It's up to you to decide that whatever movement you do, you're doing it for reasons other than weight loss. Even when the person teaching you suddenly pops out with ""burn those calories, girls.""

I felt this workout in different parts of my legs than I do on the treadmill--especially on the outsides of my thighs and hips. My arms got a harder workout than they are used to. As I was doing the Jane-Fonda-esque arm moves, I thought about how stronger triceps will make me a stronger swimmer. And, I kind of enjoyed the retro-feel of the exercises.

This DVD has an introduction, where Debra spends some time talking about fitness for all bodies. Then there is a 30-ish minute workout. There is an option for a 52 minute workout, which I was going to do today. This longer workout restarts the first workout, minus the warm-up. I decided that 30 minutes were enough, but I thought it was sort of innovative to offer some way to extend the workout if you want to.

There is something called Circle Time, which is basically a short advertisement for Debra's gym. If you don't live in Philadelphia,  you don't really need it.

I'd do this DVD again on days when I want to train, but can't get outside or to the gym.

3872884,3,B0028P4WJA,"After doing Leslie Sansone's WATP videos for about three months, I bought this video for a change.

THE BAD
I am in no means in perfect shape, but this video barely got my heartrate up enough to burn a decent amount of calories (according to my HR monitor). The video run length says 52 minutes, but the workout portion itself is barely 30 minutes long. By the time I started to feel I was getting a workout, the cool down began. I actually ended up doing a 2 mile WATP workout after this video to increase my calories burned.

THE GOOD
This video would be great for those that are very new to exercise and have very low endurance. The moves were simple and easy to follow, even the first time I did this tape. The instructor had a nice positive attitude, but did not annoy me at all throughout the tape. It is rather refreshing to see plus size people in an exercise video.

She'll ask if they're ready and it's coming --- and then you do 6 more reps of the current move before you change.
