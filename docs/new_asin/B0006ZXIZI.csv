8044232,1,B0006ZXIZI,"Why can't I get English subtitles with the movies?  I get them with the interviews
but absolutely nothing when I start the movie.  Very frustrating!!  If anyone has the answer I'd be pleased to know.
Every film I have (12 now) from the Pol-Art(sp?)film company has exactly the same
problems. Do I need to buy a new DVD player just to watch these?  I certainly would love to watch these films!  Anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance.",1255046400,,435,4.5256410256410255
