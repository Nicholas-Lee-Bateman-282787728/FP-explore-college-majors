A window pane is smashed, the window opened by a gloved hand. There is a view of the sea. Holmes is sent on vacation for a complete rest for a few weeks. How did he know that? He read the parish magazine. Cornwall has stones as monuments from unrecorded history. One day Holmes hears of a problem. Two brothers and their sister were in good health in the evening, the next morning the woman is dead and the two men are insane! ""It is devilish."" ""No sign of violence"" said the Doctor. The brothers are taken away to an asylum. Holmes inspects the room where they were found. He questions the housekeeper about the events. A cousin asks Holmes about the case. The next day they learn the third brother has died like his sister! The housekeeper is sick now.

Holmes noted that a fire or lamp was burning (literally). What is that substance? A stupid experiment by Holmes? Holmes summons that cousin to tell him what he knows. Dr. Sterndale tells Holmes about his past. Sterndale knows about the Devil's Foot Root from West Africa. He told Mortimer about it earlier. Sterndale tells Holmes what he did. Holmes advises him to continue on his journey. Holmes tells Watson what he might have done in the same circumstances. And he is on a holiday! [I wonder who inherits the Tregennis estate now? None of them had children.]

Most murders are caused by a lust for money. Was this the cause of that family quarrel? Is this an argument for restrictions on drugs? There were few restrictions on the sale and use of drugs in those days (until they learned of the dangers). This is a good story but not one of the best. ""The Adventure of the Devil's Foot"" is found in the collection named ""His Last Bow"", the final stories by A. Conan Doyle. There were changes from the original story, such as Sterndale's revolver and its use in the early morning. Was this censored?

Silver Blaze, 1987 film

It starts with a few horses running along. Men watch them in secret. The newspaper reports the murder of a horse trainer. How did that horse disappear from an isolated area? Who killed its trainer? Holmes and Watson go to Dartmoor. Colonel Ross explains the facts. Stable lads slept with the horses to guard them. Inspector Gregory accompanies them. Holmes questions the maid and the stable boy, they tell what happened that night. The next morning `Silver Blaze' was gone while Ned slept. They find John Straker's body, a terrible blow to his head killed him. Inspector Gregory has a theory. Holmes questions it.

Note Holmes conversation with the widow. Holmes finds a candle at the murder scene. Then he goes for a walk on the moor, and finds tracks and footprints. They find Silas Brown, who is unfriendly at first. Holmes tells Brown he will do exactly what he is told! Holmes borrows a picture of Straker. He asks about those sheep. ""The dog did nothing in the nighttime."" The next morning is the day of the race. Holmes washes the head of a horse and surprises Colonel Ross! The race starts, `Silver Blaze' wins. Holmes explains what happened.

I wonder about the unexplained facts about Straker's past. Was he part of a group? Did Doyle suggest that gambling on horse racing involved fixed races? When a lot of money is at risk some will try to influence the results. Was it Holmes who placed a bet in the original story?",1406419200,,3340,4.584589614740368
