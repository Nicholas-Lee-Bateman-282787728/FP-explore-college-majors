7943275,3,B00005KHLE,"This was a gift.  Recipient reported that it was okay, but he preferred seeing the war from a strategic perspective.  This set does add to the overall picture of WWII, however.",1406073600,,176,4.645161290322581
7943276,5,B00005KHLE,"Originally released in the UK as ""Britain at War in Colour"" it is by the same people behind ""The Second World War in Colour"", which was released in the States as ""World War II the Lost Color Archive"". It follows the same format as the earlier title. John Thaw provides the overall narration, and others read selections from letters and diaries as the images go by. There is no wasted studio time; just original color film from start to end. I don't think this good as the first one (which I called ""the best documentary I've seen""). There is some extended footage of chidren playing, for example that could be from almost anytime, anywhere. However, that still means it's excellent.",1004313600,2,682,4.691666666666666
