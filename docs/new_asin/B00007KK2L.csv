1817659,5,B00007KK2L,"A teenage girl wakes up alone in an upper middle class home. She has no memory of her past, how she got there or even who she is.  Hanging up on a dressing rack next to her bed is a Japanese high school uniform.  Inside the front pocket is her school identification card with her photograph and the name: Kirika Yumura.
While searching the house further she finds a 9mm handgun which, for some unknown reason, she can tear apart, reassemble and use as effectively as an elite Special Forces soldier.  Next to the 9mm is a pocket watch that plays an enigmatic tune when opened. Before she can ponder what it all means she suddenly has to run for her life for bullets are now whistling past her head.
Enter, Mireille Bouquet: A sultry European blonde who is an accomplished assassin and goes by the name Noir as a handle. Mireille also has some issues with her past and mysteriously enough they revolve around Kurikas timepiece.
For some an unexplained reason Kurika knows all of the above. So, using the timepiece as leverage, Kurika cuts a deal with Mireille to help her to discover who she is and why she is so accomplished at killing people with little to no emotion whatsoever.  Mireille agrees but tells her that she will have to kill her once everything is explained for Kurika knows her identity as Noir. With no reluctance Kurika agrees. Subsequently, they team up and kill lots of elegantly dressed bad people, who usually deserve it, in a stylized and choreographed manner.  With each new hit, the couple inches closer and closer to resolving both their mysteries and that is three-quarters of the fun.
The voice acting on this English dub is very, very good. Even secondary characters give believable and emotive performances. The animation is above average but not jaw dropping.  The character designs are wonderful: Mireilles blonde hair lies upon her shoulders like solid structures rather than spiky masses and her bangs have gravity as well.
The music contained therein is also very good though I didn't like the opening theme very much. During the action scenes the soundtrack features a driving techno beat with an opera overlay.  It works well. The end theme is sultry and breathy with a lofty Trip-hop vibe which  grows on you.)
Noir is light, its fun and well worth the price of admission.",1046563200,4,2309,4.72636815920398
1817660,5,B00007KK2L,"I brought Noir volume one today, and to answer the first reviewer's comments on the same scene popping up over and over again: this is how the series is drawing the viewer in--first you only see a small glimpse of what happened to Marebelle's family (don't ask, just watch it already), and you learn a new clue each time.
Now, back to my review--I've heard alot of good buzz about Noir, and if volume one is any indicator, this si yet another instant classic. no giggly nonsense here, the girls are all business and take no prisoners. and the music just sets each scene erfectly. IN fact, this series has the feel an a live life action series, with so many dark secrets to learn. There's ALOT of killing here, from the shoot ups to bombings, so this is NOT for the kids.",1046390400,3,770,4.391608391608392
1817661,4,B00007KK2L,"I couldn't agree more on the other customer's comment on that editorial review is flawed.  I am guessing that he watched the first few episodes instead of whole.
This series fits in classic suspense thriller.  As main characters try to uncover the secrets, more mystical it becomes.  The series has slow start, but every here and there lends a clue in which becomes focal point to open up bigger picture.  If you are not interested after first few, you probably wouldn't bother to care.
The character design is well done.  They are simple, and cleanly drawn.  The backgrounds gives nice details and its diversity.
As for sound, it could've been better.  The openning theme irritated me so much, that I always skipped them.  Ringering sounds as well as dark tone of monastery are well done.
Story, definately classy, and well done.  It leaves bits of information on what to come, but mystifies enough to keep you focused.
I suggests that this series should be viewed once you have some exposure to animes, because this is story-driven one.  Once you overcome the first few (which is the weakest link), you will be rewarded with one of better anime series.",1046131200,3,1154,4.782828282828283
1817662,4,B00007KK2L,"'Noir' presents continuously unfolding puzzle rising from the mysterious histories of the two protagonists.  Kirika Yuumura awakens one morning without any memories of who she is.  A high school ID gives her a name, her only other possessions of note are a gun and a very unusual pocket watch.  A hint of a memory tells her to contact Mirielle Bouquet.  Mirielle is a professional assassin of considerable skill who is not happy to find a teen-age girl on her hands.  Even when it turns out that Kirika has the skills of a master assassin, herself.  Finally, she concedes, and the two women return to Paris, where Mirielle lives.  As the plot moves through the initial five episodes, the two assassins, who call themselves 'Noir,' make several hits and then find that Noir is the target of a secret organization - Les Soldats.
My first impression, based on obscure references to 'guardian maidens whose dark hands protect the new-born' was this was a combination of the 'girls-with-guns' genre and the more traditional 'magical girl' story line.  However, the included production notes make it quite clear that there is to be no magic or super powers involved.  Even with this assurance, there is clearly something going on larger than the adventures of two assassins.  The name on Kirika's lips when she wakens with no memories is 'Noir' and there are many hints that this 'code name' is far older than the assassins are.  In addition, the regency engraving on the ever-present musical pocket watch is of two guardian women with swords.  Such is the stuff of which mystery is made.
The same production notes admit that director Kouichi Mashimo was striving for a noir-like effect in the production.  However, what he has used the dark mood and dialog of romantic noir, the film itself, with its beautiful European backdrops, is visually something else entirely.  If the artwork is beautiful, the animation is minimalist, in the best sense of the word.  Little energy is spent on peripheral action, keeping the entire focus on the characters on stage.  At first, the action seems a tiny bit stilted, but then the eye makes the needed adjustment, and the viewer becomes completely engaged.  Yuki Kajiura's musical scoring is captivating as well, contributing much to the visual atmospherics
The only flaw is the English dubbing.  The best one can say is that it is accurate, but it is surprisingly flat for a film with such a high level of tension.  ""Noir' uses dialog sparingly, and the dubbing needs to be more grounded, both emotionally and theatrically.  You will want to take the time to listen to the Japanese with subtitles.  The difference is remarkable.  Had it not been for the weakness of the English reading I would have given this opening series DVD a clear 5 stars, and think this will be one of 2003's best releases.",1045785600,9,2830,4.852083333333334
1817663,4,B00007KK2L,"First off, if I was reviewing this in terms of Noir as an anime rather than the Noir DVD as a package, it would get five stars unquestioningly. Noir is a stunningly beautiful, masterfully-constructed, heart-rending tour de force of an anime. It's not like every other anime in the world, and for that reason alone many people will hate it; ultimately Noir is about people entangled in a bitter, brutal and convoluted battle for truth and survival, and how those people and their relationships grow, develop and are slowly unravelled. If you fail to empathise with the characters in the first instance, Noir will not work for you; if they capture your heart, then Noir will instantly become your favourite anime and stay that way for time immemorial, such will its words and images sear themselves into your mind, heart and soul. It is not a ""style over substance"" anime as many claim; indeed, there are times when Noir is very much *not* about style, with the animation rather primitive in places, but it's more that the substance is very difficult to reach if you're just not the type to care about the characters. There's nothing quite like it out there, and for that reason alone, you need to try it; there's a chance that it simply will not mesh with you, but if you are one of those who its appeal captures, you're in line for one of anime's greatest mental, emotional and spiritual rollercoasters since Evangelion.
I loved Noir long before I bought this first DVD; I'd seen the fansub. The DVD has all those nice little extra features you'd expect, with character sketches, original Japanese promo trailers, clean opening and closing sequences and a selection of other ADV previews, and outside of the disc content, a beautiful set of liner notes illustrating may of the production team's thoughts on the series. There are also five episodes, so it's good value for money, all in all. However, this DVD also has an English-language dub track. I'm not one to be elitist and knock a dub for the simple sake that it isn't a sub, but above and aside the fact that the subtle connotations in the voice-acting of Noir - which has precious little dialogue and is sometimes entirely carried by the emotions in the characters' voices - make a dub pretty much impossible, this one is, quite frankly, appalling. Kirika sounds like a My Little Pony character with laryngitis and is far more emotionless than she's supposed to be (contrary to popular belief, Kirika is *not* meant to be Rei IV), and Mireille sounds downright depressed when she's meant to be flippant and couldn't-care-less. In short, both of the characters sound extremely tired and world-weary, and if this is your first experience of Noir you'll instantly consign it to the back of the shelf, because it's physically and emotionally draining to watch. The original Japanese dialogue, by comparison, is mysterious, intriguing and illustrates far more depth betwen the main characters than ""oh, we're assassins and we kill people and we'd really like some Prozac right about now"". So, no matter what your position on subs and dubs, do this one a favour and *don't* watch the dub track; it's not, as I've said before, a regular anime, and really does need to be experienced in its original language to get the full effect. It makes *so* much difference. (Think of Card Captor Sakura vs. Cardcaptors; yes, *that* much of a difference.)
Also, at some points, I found the subtitles themselves a little lacking; they seem to vary between clinical, literal translations of the dialogue, and flowery over-interpretations. Ultimately they too fail to capture a lot of the subtle nuances of the original language (for example, when Kirika asks Mireille to ""give me some"" - popcorn, that is, hentai - in episode 3, yes, that *is* the literal meaning of her words, but the *connotations* are more polite than how that blunt request sounds in English. It's more like, ""I'd like some, please"".), and to experience this anime at its best you'll either need to know a little cursory Japanese or have a dictionary to hand for those crucial bits of dialogue. I'd have personally liked some on-screen translation notes at points, but I've been spoiled with the fansubs, I suppose. Alternatively, turn the subs off and watch without! Not recommended until you've actually seen the series once first, but some fans swear by the fact that the subtle hints in the characters' voices and gestures are easier to pick up without the distraction of translated dialogue. I was also slightly annoyed that the Japanese language track is 2.1 surround sound, whereas the English track is 5.1, meaning the Japanese comes across as slightly flatter in sound quality, but that's me being a nitpick and most people probably won't notice it.
Ultimately if you love Noir, you love Noir. If you hate Noir, you hate Noir. There's very little room for middle ground, as with all works of fine art; you either ""get"" Picasso or you think your dog could paint better with the leftovers of the Sunday roast. But every anime fan has a duty to Bee Train to at least try this one out, and maybe discover something beautiful. The production values of this DVD aren't perfect, but if you're willing to live with it and *not* watch the dub, I highly, highly recommend Noir as a series.",1045699200,30,5296,4.808114035087719
1817664,5,B00007KK2L,"...
In my opinion, the editorial review dishonors Tsukimura Ryoue's rather remarkable script, because it stands on incorrect premises concerning the two main heroines of the story, Yuumura Kirika and Mireille Bouquet. Let me make the following two points.
1. The implication that Mireille met Kirika in Paris, is an oversimplification, if not a downright misunderstanding. The implication is particularly inappropriate if it refers specifically to their first meeting told in the first episode. In the first episode, Mireille in Paris receives an email from one Yuumura Kirika and travels to Japan to find out what this girl was. Mireille was attracted to go there because the piece of tune attached to the email could be associated with the painful memory of her childhood. The location of their first meeting, where the first battle sequence also takes place, is in Kanagawa Prefecture, in the southwest vicinity of Tokyo. This information is presented to the audience by means of Kirika's school ID card. Only in the later part of the first episode, Mireille returns to Paris with Kirika, to start their half bitter honeymoon as the team Noir.
2. The statements, ""neither woman can remember her past"" and ""the only recurring characters in Noir are amnesiacs"" are not correct. Of all the dramatis personae, only Kirika could be quite said to be an amnesiac. Other main characters, Mireille, Chloe and Altena seem to remember their pasts quite clearly. Even for Kirika, a ""blank slate"" would be imprecise words to describe her personality and abilities. A part of her memory had been concealed from herself. This was done hypnotically by an unknown party to suit their design, as will be revealed in the episodes 20 and 21. In the first episode, we find Kirika left to live alone in a house in Kanagawa which supposedly belongs to her family, but no one else is there. She leads a seemingly normal schoolgirl's life, but with a Beretta of unknown identity which she uses with a staggering skill. And she daringly attracts a pretty and deadly assassin from Paris. ...In my opinion, Kirika as a person is anything but uninteresting. Much more interesting facets of her personality will be revealed in the episodes to come.
Noir is perhaps not an animation for everyone, since it contains so much killing and the hints on lesbianism are not negligible. Even with these marks subtracted, I suspect Noir to be one of the most noteworthy achievements among the recent products of Japanese animation....",1044662400,20,2497,5.0048076923076925
1817665,5,B00007KK2L,"A set of 13DVDs contains all 26 episodes of the original Japanese version of Noir : the picture format is in 16:9 widescreen, the sound track is in 2.0 Linear PCM. I have watched these episodes over and over again. Noir is a rare masterpiece of extraordinary fiction, created by, and every episode written by, Tsukimura Ryoue. Even here in Japan, where the life of someone like myself is assailed by floods of animation, it is hard to compare the dramatic intensity and prowess of Noir to anything else.
Noir is the story of two virgins, tragically grew up as assassins, desperately seeking light in their native darkness, and learning to love one another. Obstacles lie ahead in their paths, naturally. One particular and overwhelming trial exists between the two heroines which will become disclosed in the final series of episodes. The animation does not depict lesbianism in any explicit manner. Instead, their love is implied subtly and with depth of fluctuating emotions.
The voice cast is done by some of the very finest of our voice actresses. The main heroines Yuumura Kirika and Mireille Bouquet are performed by Kuwashima Houko and Mitsuishi Kotono; the assisting heroines Chloe and Altena are done by Hisakawa Aya and Tarako. It is not just that the voice cast is distinguished. Noir pushes these talented voice actresses to go even beyond their normally high standards of performance. Kuwashima Houko reflects that acting Kirika was very difficult, but she positively claims Kirika is a treasure in her career.
While the artwork is neatly executed, there is somewhat a naive feel about it. This may discourage a new viewer, especially when watching an episode for the first couple of times. Nevertheless, the drawings have a distinct flavor which I think will grow likeable after repeated viewings.
Amazon.com's own review seems not fully informed and inaccurate. Not both Mireille and Kirika are amnesiacs. Mireille's memory remains intact all the way. Not for a moment does she forget the agonizing tragedy of her childhood. A part of Kirika's memory was hypnotically hidden from herself. This was done by a design of someone, for a purpose.
The unique emotional experience of Noir is opulently enhanced by Kajiura Yuki's exceptional musical scores and lyrics.",1044230400,13,2275,5.0855614973262036
1817666,3,B00007KK2L,"I watched a part of Noir and I can easily say that it is not the best series out there.  You will probably watch the first episode and say ""Wow this rocks!  This fight scene is pretty damn cool, the girls are hot and the music rocks too!""  Then you will watch the second episode and say ""This fight scene is cool, the girls are hot and the music rocks too!"". Then the third episode will come around and you will say ""....wait, didn't this happen in the last episode?""
Well at least thats how it was for me. After the first few episodes the show just seemed to get repetitive.  Nothing was really happening with the plot, and the fights were getting to be same old.  I had heard from a friend that alot later in the series it starts to pick up again, but do you really want to wait like 13 episodes for something to happen?  I sure as hel dont.
  If you still aren't sure then go ahead and buy the first DVD and find out for yourself if you like it or not.",1044057600,4,955,4.042553191489362
1817667,5,B00007KK2L,I'm going to make this short.  This is the best series I have ever seen.  I watched the japanese version and it was truly amazing.  I have high hopes for this release and would urge any anime fan to buy it.,1042070400,,206,3.975609756097561
1817668,4,B00007KK2L,"This is a beautiful anime with absolutely gorgeous animation and beautiful music.  The plot is rich and original that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you wanting more.  You just have to know who the Soldats are and the little twist of fantasy (the legend behind Noir) makes it even more interesting.  My only complaint is way too many flashbacks!  They flashback to scenes in the last episode or even the same episode.  After awhile, the flashbacks begin to get on your nerves.  Overall, this is a wonderful anime and I strongly recomend it.",1088467200,,554,4.6020408163265305
1817669,5,B00007KK2L,"After a second full viewing, I'm forced to conclude that Noir may have a deep and meaningful embedded/interlaced/concealed plot.  For example:  Why is Mireille the only person in the Noir universe permitted to kill Kirika at any moment?  If I'd had the right childhood training, I'd have immediately understood that Kirika possessed the true heart of a Samurai, and had completely embraced the life-role of a sworn retainer to Mireille from the moment they first met.  This one twist...once made clear to me...affected my perception of all of Kirika's following actions.
There are more than a few perception-changing twists lurking within this series.  To me, these make Noir into an interesting and entertaining piece of work.  That being said, I found the re-use of many brief non-action segments to be maddening.  (How many times do we need to see someone picking grapes?)  This series would be even more enjoyable if there were fewer repeated scenes.
Overall:  The artwork is wonderful.  The music is superb.  I like the restrained use of physical ability.  None of the action sequences require much effort in order to suspend disbelief.  The weapons are frighteningly realistic.
I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, but the system demands either 4 or 5.  Very well...I'll give it a 5.",1075420800,5,1283,5.018957345971564
1817670,4,B00007KK2L,"Noir is a classic in the making and this DVD deserves to be watched by every anime fan.

With such a mysterious connection between characters, it is a change from the dutiful protagonists who are pure and good. With an inspirational soundtrack that goes with it and scene after scene of eye opening action, I reccomend this DVD to anyone who likes action anime.",1072915200,3,329,4.576271186440678
1817672,4,B00007KK2L,"First I couldn't say that this would be everybody's type of anime.  If you like fan service, comedy, or romances look elsewhere immediately.  Despite fan fiction sites, that would turn the affection between the two principals into Lesbian subtext.  It's not about that kind of relationship either.  Noir is more about style than plot, although it does have a plot.
These early episodes take a while to draw your interest. I put the first DVD into my player, and watched most of the way though episode one a number of times.  I kept getting distracted, and losing interest.  I was hoping this was not one of ""those"" series, that I just can't stand watching.  I call it the ""Ship of Fools Syndrome"", based on my experience with that highly rated, but overlong movie.  I tried to watch the Ship of Fools no less than a dozen times, mainly because it's supposed to be a great movie. To this day, I still have never been able to sit through more than an hour, and cannot recall anything that happened in that overlong, black and white film.  Fortunately, Noir escaped that fate.
I finally watched beyond the first episode, and the series started to grow on me a little. The introduction is a little strange; a smallish, Japanese schoolgirl with amnesia, sends an E-mail, and musical message to a highly accomplished, female, professional assassin. Questions abound as to why she sought her out, how she knew to attract her attention, (somehow piquing the interest of something in her forgotten past). The little Japanese girl is an incredibly talented killer in her own right, and seems to have a lot of people trying to kill her for unknown reasons.
The girls form an uneasy, temporary alliance, and start calling themselves Noir.  Noir apparently refers to a legendary pair of assassins from French history.  Mireille Bouquet, the contract killing professional, is from Corsica.  She agrees to take on the little girl, who may or may not be named Kirika (from a school ID card in her possession).  When she finds out some answers, she promises to kill her.  Together they begin taking on some of Mireille's regular contract jobs.
The second episode just demonstrates the incredible efficiency this pair has in their profession. Its action for the sake of action. On about the third episode, some of the series plot starts to unfold, the mission is compromised, and we learn how really good Kirika can be as a killer.  The final two episodes in the first five, show more about someone else working in the background, to set up this new incarnation of Noir.
I will repeat this anime is more about style than plot, and the action does become enjoyable.  The music is excellent, it reminded me of the style music in .hack//sign, but somehow seems much better.  Beware, the music often plays in the background, long after watching the series you'll find it playing repeatedly in your head. Art and animation are very good especially the action sequences.  Some of the details were a little off. I found it interesting, that they both observed the Japanese custom of removing their shoes at the door, even though Mireille is a Corsican who lives in Paris. The good news here is, after a slow start, I leave the first five episodes wanting to see more.",1069372800,13,3242,4.748663101604278
1817673,5,B00007KK2L,"Hey this dvd is simply awesome. the music fits so well with whatever scene is playing. it has great animation. One thing i did not like was that their voices were so soft that i had to turn on the english subtitles to find out what they were saying!

1817674,3,B00007KK2L,"It's a little more mature than Najica, but also a bit slow and plodding. I'm not saying that Noir should be passed up, in fact I'd suggest buying it, but not perhaps as your first choice when building a collection.
The one thing which this series has that makes it stand out is the sheer cold-blooded manner in which the two protagonists kill. They have character and personality but also regularly gun down people in such a cold fashion that you are compelled to puzzle over just how these two could have gotten to this point.
 And that is the whole hook - two cute (of course) girls (of course) who assasinate their targets without pity. Even in mainstream Hollywood do you rarely find scenes quite so merciless. Not outright evil, just cold-blooded.
I'm not saying this is good or bad. It IS different, in a series that without it would be terribly drab.
So final analysis - Noir is overrated, but not by too much, and it has it's moments. Just don't buy it for your brooding teenage daughter before she goes to gun-camp...",1065571200,,1026,4.545945945945946
1817675,4,B00007KK2L,"Mireille Bouquet is a professional, an artist that ranks as one of the best, one of the most skilled of any in her line of business.  She is an assassin, polished and experienced.  But even the smartest of hunters sometimes become the hunted.
Kirika Yumura, a young Japanese girl, has no knowledge of her past, yet her body is as deadly and as dangerous as Mireille's.  She also has no idea why she has the pocket watch, the one that plays a song that Mireille remembers from her past, a past she wishes to forget.
One girl without a past and one woman who runs from it.  Where will they end up?
The anime is well made, well crafted.  The characters, their expressions, their actions, their lines are all carefully directed and controlled.  Nothing is wasted, from the settings to the title of each episode.  Most everything was realistic - no aliens, no monsters, no energy swords and no fan-service.
But I do have a few complaints.  For a anime called Noir, about assassins and mystery, the action is kind of slow and uninteresting.  Also I was not ""DRAWN"" in by the plot or ""captivated"" by the women.  I may or may not continue to buy DVDs from the series.
The extras on the DVD, the information filled fold-out and the pair of 3-D glasses that came with the DVD, were all very nice and showed that a lot more thought were put into the extras than with most DVDs.",1065312000,,1366,4.428
1817676,2,B00007KK2L,"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL music from Yuki Kajiura, who also did music for Hack Sign.
Noir is all style and some substance. The concept is cool, but it goes downhill quickly after the first episode. It is unbelievable that they can gun down hordes of men and not get scathed. The action itself is stylish and unique, but again unbelievable. And why are the main characters only women? There are enough over-sexualized women power fantasies for boys to watch.
If you want to see a cool and stylish action anime, buy Read or Die instead of 26 episodes of Noir at $20 a DVD.",1064188800,2,565,4.549019607843137
1817677,5,B00007KK2L,"NOIR, A word that means many things.  In this case, its a series that you are thinking of starting to collect.  I have a few requirements before you buy.
First, you have to know what Film Noir is.  Its in the dictionary, and its a style of movie or television that confuses many people.  All of the bad reviews (3 or below) have to do with not understanding this style.
Noir aired in Japan at 1 a.m.  It was intended for adults because Anime is often an adult pastime there.  80% of the substance of this series is shown through dramatic camera angles and the ACTIONS of the characters.  In a standard episode, Kirika says very few lines....you can count them on both hands in most cases.
Its story line is also very complex.  While they are trying to find out who is trying to kill them, you have to realize that they have to eat too (to the person whining about ""why are they assassinating people?"").  Thier profession is killing, so they occasionally need to do a job and buy food.
I'm rambling.  The key is understanding what you are buying.  This is a show in a style that may take getting used to.  Once you're used to it, you will love this show.  In fact, while waiting for each subsequent volume to come out I often rewatch and suddenly pick up on something I didn't see before.  Don't let that scare you away.  This story is not worth missing if you read the back of the first disc and like what you see.",1062288000,7,1414,4.283018867924528
1817678,4,B00007KK2L,"This anime is kind of hard to judge.  The first episode blew me away with all the action sequences and the absolutely fantastic music but then as it progressed, the episodes just began to d...r...a....g.... and go so freaking slowly.  Its not that they weren't interesting but they were dragged out so unbearably long that I found myself zoning out many times.  So, this is the only way I can think to judge it.
Music-  Fabulous! I absolutely adore it! Its beautiful and eerie and really kicks up the fight scenes.  Probably half the reason I like the show.
Background designs-  Its beautiful! Totally beautiful and detailed backgrounds.  The cobblestone buildings and roads, the sky, everything is totally gorgeous.
Action scenes-  When they're there, the fighting is great.  Its edge of your seat stuff and very impressive.
Character designs-  eh, a bit plain in my opinion.  Pretty much like a lot of other animes I've seen.  But the characters are colored nicely.
Plot-  Okay, I think I'm missing something here.  The younger girl, whatever her name is with the short dark hair,  wants to find out her past.  Right.  So she goes to the Blond girl Mirelle.  Now, they have to go on random assassination attempts for what reason?  I don't get it! How the heck is assassinating these people, when I don't even know who they are or how the heck they're related to anything, going to bring back that girl's past?  What are they doing!!  Yes, I like the action sequences but half the time, I dont' have any idea who they're fighting and what it has to do with anything! Argh!
English dub-  everyone's voices are pretty decent.  I usually find myself watching the dub if its good, and the sub if it isn't good.  However, the younger dark haired character's english voice is awful!  She sounds like she's making her voice as high pitched and choked up sounding as possible.  Ugh, she sounds like she's going to cry all the time.  The sub is much nicer.  Her voice is soft without being whiny and very pretty.
Character developement- The first episode intrigued me with the two main characters.  I wanted to know more about them.  But after the episodes progressed and I was left with slow moving story,  flashbacks that are repeated over and over and over again, I just didn't care anymore.  They just show too little human emotion and I can't seem to get attatched to them. How can you care about characters that don't care about... pretty much anything?  So truthfully, they could both drop dead and I wouldn't exactly be traumatized.  Might make it a little more interesting to tell you the truth.
Overall, I'd have to say if I continue this show it'll be for the art, the music, and the few fight scenes that are great when they're actually there.  However, if it continues to drag like this, I'll probably just give up.",1060646400,2,2820,4.651115618661257
1817679,3,B00007KK2L,"I have the boxed set for this series and have watched a little more then half of it so far.  This review, then, is the review of someone who has started the series and, having not finished it yet, is giving his opinion on it thus far.
Overall, I have found Noir to very well done but not really too enjoyable.  I love the artwork and feel of the series, which fits very well with its plot and setting.  The basics of the plot and setting are that two assassins, obviously the two girls that are featuresd everywhere on the box and dvd cases if you haven't already guessed, flit about Europe doing hits for mysterious employers, all the while attempting to reconcile their pasts and figure out the mystery that is surrounding them, the mysterious organization known as the Soldats, and the legacy if the maiden assassins named Noir.
While very original, this ends up turning into a rather slow, boring, and a somewhat emotionless anime.  While the two assassin women are nice eye candy and the action scenes can occassionally be exciting, too much of this anime is spent with the girls sitting around various places thinking or talking quietly about their next job or one of the mysteries they are trying to figure out at that moment.  In general, I would say at least half of this series is very very quiet and actionless.
And you can forget about emotion or dramma too.  The two assassins are virtually robotic in the range of feelings and expressions they show.  Heck, they generally express the same emotions when shooting someone as when they are eating something or sitting around doing nothing as usual.  Comedy is also absent completely from this series, with not a ingle laugh or joke being present in all of the first 4 dvds.
So what, you may ask, is the point of this series if there is little action, no humour, and no emotion  or drama?  Mystery and philosophy seem to be about it.  The entire anime, up to the point I've seen, seems to rest entirely on figuring out who the Soldats are and the assassins moping around trying to get to grips with who they really are themselves.
In the end, I think this anime series could be really enjoyable for some, but its defenitely not for everyone.  If you feel like a quiet, deep, and srtistic anime series, then you won't go too far off the bat with Noir.  If you're looking for a rush, Noir will probably not do it for you.",1059868800,7,2379,4.491879350348028
1817680,4,B00007KK2L,"""Silly caricatures with gigantic eyes and frame rates of about 2 per minute, almost like watching a slide show with really bad narration.""
That's how another customer summarized his attitudes toward anime before Cowboy Bebop. I haven't seen enough anime to agree with the points he makes about ""silly caricatures"" or ""bad narration,"" but I can understand about the frame rates. If a character is supposed to be running, I'd like to see them moving within a background, instead of standing still while the background sorta moves. (And I'd like the background to be more than a few colored stripes.)
I might be biased because of Western animation (although I've read that the stereotypical anime BIG EYES comes from Disney) but the *animation* of anime isn't a style that I like. Then again, I don't think we're often exposed to the best of what anime has to offer (Pokemon, Dragonball on the Kids WB, for example). A lot of the anime I've seen has been sparse (particularly the backgrounds), occasionally overexposed/washed out, and eclipsed by a shower of flowers and feathers. I like my animation less dreamlike and more realistic.
That said, I loved the Miyazaki film Spirited Away. I didn't care much for the story, but it was the most gorgeous animation I'd ever seen. It was fluid, not choppy. And it had tremendous depth and color. I thought: more like this, please. So while shopping with a friend who is a big anime buff, I happened upon the DVDs for a TV series called Noir, which looked pretty promising. I don't mind reading the occasional fantasy novel, but any anime involving dragons, magical kingdoms, or Teens With Enchanted Weapons doesn't immediately appeal to me. Noir seemed totally grounded in realism and I liked that.
It doesn't have an unfamiliar premise. Think Long Kiss Goodnight with Geena Davis. It's about a pair of female assassins, and one of them has amnesia. Kirika, the small, quiet one, learns that her life as a student, and the people she knows as her parents, are fabrications and that the only truth is that she has a talent for killing. She turns to the assassin Mireille, who agrees to help Kirika uncover her past, only because they themselves are being targeted for extermination. But when everything is said and done, Mireille tells Kirika she is a liability and she'll be killed. Kirika says she'll be waiting for that day.
The reviewers say Noir is too depressing and lacks humor, but I disagree. It's supposed to be weighty and powerful, not a fun-filled, slapstick-laced romp. The humor is infrequent and subtle but it's there. I get a lot of amusement out of the way Mireille uses her sexuality to disarm her male opponents, then easily dispatches them. And there is humor in the way Mireille is so casual and matter-of-fact about her profession.
The animation is gorgeous for the most part. No issues with frame rates. It's not choppy. And since Noir is set all over the world, there's plenty of variety in the backgrounds. The reviewers also complain that quite a bit of animation is recycled episode to episode. This is because Noir is a TV series and it's less expensive to pad each episode with old footage. It's never more than a minute per episode, and it's always an appropriate mood-setting flashback. The recycling is not a huge detractor in an otherwise great series.
Special mention must be paid to Kajiura Yuki's music. It's got grand, operatic vocal cues that are just breathtaking: ""Canta per Me,"" for example, which is one of two cues that drives the action/fighting/shooting (the other being, ""Salva Nos""). There are a few thumping techno beats. Lots of cute string/woodwind melodies for the European scenes (""Romance,"" ""Corsican Corridor"") and somber but beautiful piano tunes (""Solitude by the Window""). Plus, a cool pop/rock song for the intro (""Coppelia no Hitsugi"") and a sweet song for the end credits (""Kireina Kanjou""). A very eclectic, ethnic mix (each episode even starts out with a Gregorian chant).
To conclude, I have found Noir to be the best looking, best SOUNDING, and most provocative animated series I've had the pleasure of watching since Batman Adventures. And since Batman Adventures is regrettably not on DVD yet (not in any type of comprehensive box set, anyway), Noir is definitely worth checking out, even if you're like me and anime isn't your typical thing.",1059782400,3,4350,4.8956639566395665
1817681,5,B00007KK2L,"I've only seen the first 15 eps of this series.  The first couple of DVDs I felt were great action, animation and atmosphere, even if using a somewhat formulaic duo( soul searching amnesiac and assassin).  However, the series seems to get repetitive after that, varying little from ""we get contract to kill some corrupt person"" or ""kill them before they kill us"".  The ""kill bad people only"" idea seems to be the method the creators use to make NOIR's killing seem justified.  The characters don't seem to develop beyond their assassin persona (though Kirika seems to struggle more with killing than Mirielle) which makes it difficult for me to care about them.  Then again, I've only seen the first 15 eps.  Still, it's a fun ride I don't mind riding more than once.

UPDATE:  Finished the series a long time ago...and nothing's really changed in my opinion.",1057795200,,859,4.795918367346939
1817682,2,B00007KK2L,"Noir, vol. I: Shades of Darkness (Kouichi Mashimo, 2001)
Man, everything about this twenty-six episode series (the vol. I DVD encompasses the first five) screams ""must-own"" in concept. Imagine an anime version of Leon with a full-series limited edition release packaged in a coffin. I lusted after it without having ever seen it, so I figured before shelling out the cash, I should probably rent the series and see if it would hold up under repeated viewings, or whether I'd be shelling out for a fifty-buck piece of 3-D artwork.
Unfortunately, the latter seems to be the case. There's nothing overly special about he animation here (although some of the backdrops are stunning), the plot is overly simplistic (which the writers tried to make up for by making the characters' histories convoluted. Oh, boy), and do we really need THAT much repetition of certain frame sequences? No, no we don't. I'll stick with watching Leon and Akira back to back and thinking mournfully on what could have been. **",1057536000,5,1000,4.923076923076923
1817683,5,B00007KK2L,"Noir is the tale of two female assassins whom by some strange twist of destiny end up working together.  In the introductory installment, we are drawn into the mysterious past of ""Noir"", the assassin with no memory.  When she teams up with Mireille, they reinstate the archaic assassin ""Noir"" as their operating codename.
Together the two seem an awkward pair, a teenager and an experienced gun for hire, similar to Leon: the Professional (and yes, I too agree with a previous reviewer that the plant the two share in their abode is a direct copy of the one in Leon, with respect to its symbolism).  But more than a rip-off, it is an hommage to the great Luc Besson film.
One can find numerous references to great thrillers and film noir nostalgia, mostly in the attitudes of the characters that appear from episode to episode.  And glory, glory, what a magnificent soundtrack this series has!  It's not quite as fitting as Cowboy Bebop's, but it works well.
Unfortunately, as many have noted, the use of flashbacks is a bit overabused, and for that reason I give this first installment a 4.5, instead of a perfect score.  Furthermore, the followup DVD #2 (Hit List) takes the flashbacks to an even worse extreme and makes for little new content (besides the slight backtracked and then sidetracked development of Mireille).
Even so, I highly recommend any fan of anime check out Noir - Shades of Darkness.  It has style, it has grace, it has a lot going for it.  I can only hope that the later installments rekindle the sense of wonder this first wonderful installment had in spades.",1055462400,,1584,4.713768115942029
1817684,5,B00007KK2L,"Though this is supposed to be for the first DVD in this series, this review reflects the entire series.  ""Noir"" is currently my favorite anime series, and one I highly recommend to fellow anime lovers, those interested in finding a good introduction to anime, and those who love great stories and characterization.
Many reviewers argue that ""Noir"" is style over substance, but they couldn't be more wrong.  ""Noir"" is style AND substance working harmoniously together to produce an engaging and satisfying drama that takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.  Subtle characterizations, a story of epic sweep, beautifully rendered backgrounds of exotic locations, and haunting melodies (a fabulous score by Yuki Kajiura) all combine into something unique.
The series follows assassins-for-hire Kirika Yuumura and Mireille Bouquet as they seek to uncover the secrets of their past.  For Kirika the past is a blank slate; she has no memories of who she is or where she comes from.  Mireille, on the other hand, has never been able to forget her traumatic childhood.  As they begin to find the answers to both their pasts, deadly forces try repeatedly to ensnare them.  The centerpiece of the series is the deepening relationship between Kirika and Mireille.  Their relationship is depicted subtly and is open to interpretation, and there is a noticeable lack of ""fan service"" in the series, which sets it apart from other works of anime in this particular sub-genre.
ADV Films is releasing this series in a seven DVD set.  The DVDs feature anamorphic wide-screen versions of the episodes, 5.1 audio, and both the subtitled Japananese and English soundtracks.  Do yourself a favor and watch the series subtitled.  The Japanese voice actresses give wonderfully nuanced performances.  There are also a few extras on each disk, including easter eggs.  They are also selling the first DVD in a box set with a tshirt.
The market share for anime in the US is still woefully small, so DVD prices are often much higher than for other releases.  ""Noir"" is one series that is well worth having in your collection if you're an anime fan.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.",1054944000,13,2163,5.0027932960893855
1817685,5,B00007KK2L,Noir is fantastic.  I was completely blown away. One of the best stories I have seen in a long time with lots of good character development.,1054512000,,140,4.384615384615385
1817686,2,B00007KK2L,"I have to admit that when I sat down and saw the first four episodes of ""Noir,"" I was electrified. It's got all the elements of a first-rate story: tortured characters, a mystical prophecy, and a dark conspiracy that seems to haunt every aspect of their lives. The animation is also admirable, and the dark, haunting music (a blend of choir-like techno) is perfect. And it even has an interesting ""Godfather""-like appeal to it -- after all, these are hired killers we're cheering for. We've left pretty soldiers of love and justice far, far behind.
But that's the problem, I guess. ""Noir"" has all the right ingredients -- but someone forgot to stir the pot.
""Noir"" never really comes together. It lags tremendously, and I got mighty frustrated waiting for that two seconds of plot exposition that might (or might not) come at the end of an episode. Pehaps it would have been better in a OVA format, but as a 26-episode series, it's simply boring. A basic episode will consist of: Mirelle and Kirika receive an assignment. It's well-nigh impossible to complete. They go in and shoot people. Against all odds, they triumph. One of their dying victims gasps out a few crytic riddles about the ""true nature of Noir."" End credits. There might be the occasional guest appearance by Chloe, but that's about it.
They manage to pull everything together, of course, by the last few episodes, but by that time you're bored and wondering if there's really any point. (I actually had a friend who watched the first six of so episodes, then jumped to the last four by accident. She was suprised to find out she'd missed sixteen episodes in between, because she'd followed the ending just fine.) While this approach doesn't always misfire -- ""Utena"" manages to carry it off -- that's usually because the creators entertain us by exploring the relationship between the main characters, and who they really are. This is difficult in ""Noir,"" since Kirika has approximately two expressions overall (""asleep"" and ""awake""), and Mireille, while a sassy lady, spends most of her time in a Pavlovian-like reaction whenever that darn watch falls open. Not exactly stunning cinema.
Overall, it's a good job gone wrong.",1053129600,20,2192,4.879356568364611
1817687,5,B00007KK2L,"A friend of mine once told me that he was tired of anime with cutesy sidekicks, aliens, magical girls, giant robots, and ancient monsters. He wanted to see something that was realistic, without all the comic relief common to other shows.
I showed him Noir.
It's a Japanese show set mostly in France featuring music sung in Latin to a techno beat. If that's not polyculturalism, I don't know what is.
It begins with Mirielle Boquet, an assassin for hire, and a young girl named Kirika Yumara. Kirika, it seems, has no memory of her past, and is being hunted by a group of relentless killers. She seeks out Mirielle, the knowledge of the other woman in her head for some reason.
It soon becomes clear that whoever erased Kirika's memory also trained her to be a professional killer. And while Mirielle is talented and professional, Kirika can kill her opponents as easily as she can breathe.
The only bit of information in Kirika's head is a verse from an old tome, ""Noir, it is the name of an ancient Fate. Two maidens who govern Death. Their black hands protect the peace of the newly born.""
Dubbing themselves Noir, Mirielle promises to help Kirika uncover her past, in an effort to unlock the secrets of her own. .
Beautifully scored music highlights the poetry in motion of their missions, as Noir seeks to learn the truths of their past and come to terms with it.
Credit where it's due, there is almost no blood in this series, despite the high body count. It's also a thinking person's anime, as you struggle to collect the clues and figure out the mysterious plots.
Included are a pair of decoder glasses to decypher a riddle on the back of the DVD insert.

1817699,5,B00007KK2L,"When professional assassin Mireille Bouquet gets a strange e-mail with a picture and a cryptic message, she at first deletes it. ""Whatever. This is stupid,"" she says aloud. But the picture turns out to be of her future partner, Kirika Yuumura. The two form a partnership and delve into each other's pasts, attempting to find the reasons behind the killing skills they both possess.
NOIR is an extremely psychologically-backed series. Mireille outwardly lives a normal, carefree life--but she's hiding a dark reality. Kirika is openly different, but she also hides her skills as a killer. Much of the Shades of Darkness DVD deals with establishing just how unstable both girls are, and how stable they pretend to be. As the story progresses, the mystery of Les Soldats unfolds, although much of this aspect of the story is not accentuated in Volume One.
Another testament to the greatness of NOIR is the music, done by Yuki Kajiura. The haunting music box melody that is featured throughout much of the series, the Latin hymn that plays during battles, and the beautiful Italian singing backed by guitars and violins--all of it adds up to a purely wonderful soundtrack. And as a connesieur of opening themes, I give NOIR's opening, Coppelia's Casket, a spot on my top ten list.
Be forewarned: After watching the first NOIR volume, you'll be in it for the long run. It's not an anime you can buy the first volume of and then leave behind. The story, the art, and overall literary quality is addictive. It's loaded with enough symbolism and irony to make your literature teacher go mad. NOIR is one of the most stunning up-and-coming anime titles, which you won't want to miss! (Rated 15+ for violence and mature themes)",1049500800,6,1717,4.863481228668942
1817700,2,B00007KK2L,"Noir deserves praise in one respect: it is technically excellent in every way--the animation is smooth, the character designs are wonderful, the music is top notch.  The problem is that these wonderful parts are assembled into an emotionally barren whole.
For its story, Noir relies on two old standby plots: the amnesiac, and the person haunted by past tragedy.  The difficulty is that both plots require characters that one can care about; neither of the main characters is likeable.  Mireille is a professional assassin, taking jobs from whomever to kill whomever--it's all just money.  Kirika is an amnesiac whose only skill is to kill, so that's what she does.  Neither has qualms or misgivings; neither is trying to become better.  They team up as the assasins called Noir merely to pursue selfish desires.
The essence of the problem, then, is that there's exactly zero reasons to prefer that Mireille and Kirika kill their targets rather than vice versa.  After one disc, I didn't want to know Kirika's oh-so-secret past.  I didn't want to learn about Mireille's oh-so-tragic childhood.  I didn't care.  These characters don't deserve the technically superb world they inhabit, because they are so lifeless and empty.

But the constant flashbacks are a bit annoying, especially if you, like me, watch at least 3 episodes at every setting. It feels like the makers were trying to make the episodes longer by inserting flashbacks that we'd already seen before because of a lack of material.
Another thing  that the show has going for it was the great score and lyricized songs. However, it's still a bit odd how every single character in the show spoke Japanese although the show took place in France and that most of the songs with lyrics had lyrics in Italian.

The dub is not recommended. Both of the main characters barely even speak louder than a whisper, and they lack the emotion of their Japanese counterparts. That's about it.

1817704,5,B00007KK2L,"It seems that half the American audience has already disposed ""Noir"" as something irritating and unwatchable, after merely sampling the first 5 episodes.
Yet to the contrary, I believe that ""Noir"" is something unique. It's one of those series that re-invents the art of story telling within the genre of anime itself. There's a very good reason for why there's so much hype surrounding this series, and ""Noir"" deserves every bit of it.
At its first viewing, it is rather apparent that ""Noir"" was never meant to be a high profile release in Japan (2001). The animation itself (although beautiful) is nothing too spectacular, as they are somewhat low in frame counts and not as detailed compared to many of its contemporary counterparts. For the mere fact that the series premiered on a 1:15 AM time slot shows that the producers didn't expect much out of the series.
Then how did ""Noir"" end up becoming such a huge success in Japan? The key lies in its story telling. ""Noir,"" unlike most anime, takes a unconventional path by trying to present its audience more than what they see on the screen. What I mean by this, is that instead of displaying everything through action and dialogue, ""Noir"" forces its viewers to focus on the psyche of the individual characters. Much of the key plot in ""Noir"" is shrouded in mystery (as of now), and its characters don't always show their emotions either. It is up to the viewers to pick up the subtle clues (i.e. facial expressions) and guess what's really going on within the characters' minds. This creates a very compelling viewing experience for the audience, and it's also quite appropriate at the same time, since Kirika and Mireille are both assasins that are 'supposed' to kill without hesitation.
By the time you have finished watching the fifth episode, you will be pondering if humanity has finally lost its soul through our greed and hate.
*""Noir"" is a work of fiction that stands on its own, with a vague similarity to ""Gunsmith Cats"" and ""Resevoir Dogs.""",1048118400,4,2005,4.797687861271676

I'm finding the reviews as interesting as the show itself.  The reviews originally convinced me to purchase Noir.  I appreciate shows that make me think, and leave things open for interpretation.  This seems to be what makes some people love this show and some people hate it, and I see that people seem to interpret it completely different.  It seems to me that the director got exactly what he wanted.  The viewers are mostly saying the same things.  It just seems that some people like what has been done, and some people do not like it.  Now that I've watched the series, I can definitely understand both sides.  One person said that he hated the dubs.  Since I don't speak any Japanese, I always watch the English dubs.  I would guess that the original Japanese voice actors had their own take on the characters.  There are some English voice actors that I try to follow.  Monica Rial that plays Kirika is one of those actors.  I thought she did an excellent job.  Especially considering the lack of overall dialog for Kirika.  Some people said there was too much violence, and other people said that there was a large body count, but very little gore.  Again both true, it depends on what bothers you, and what you are watching in the show.

I do have to agree with one person that said the reviewer for Amazon seems to have seen a completely different version.  He really did get a lot wrong, and I think he generally didn't like this type of series.  One of the reasons I like reading all the reviews is to see what people liked and didn't like.  I found some people that agreed with me in really liking the series, and some people that disliked the series for the same reasons I liked it.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Noir.  I liked the conflicted characters, and conflicted plot.  I also found myself at times wondering if I should like them.  (After all, they are assassins).  There is definitely a theme of can bad people have good traits, and can good people have bad traits.  This runs throughout the series.  Sometimes low key, and sometimes blatant.  My best suggestion is to read a bunch of the reviews, and take the parts that resonate with you and then go with your gut.  Pretty much everything that would make you like, love, hate, or be indifferent about the series is in the reviews.  If you read the good and the bad reviews and want to buy it, I think you will love it.  If you don't want to buy it after that, then you will probably want to look elsewhere.",1353024000,,2623,4.468354430379747
7977398,5,B00007KK2L,"I must say I was quite impressed with this anime. Everything from music to story to characters, this is a definite masterpiece series. I learned about this anime after watching some previews from my Full Metal Panic DVDs. I figured this one looked good and I decided to give it a try.

Since it's only Vol. 1, it's difficult to put the whole thing in words. Mystery is the theme of this anime. So much of it that it gets baffling at times, but once again, it's only Vol. 1, so don't expect answers right away. You have two female characters, one from Japan and the other from France, who are skilled at killing. The Japanese girl has no memory of her past, all she knows is that she is very skilled at killing. The French woman is a professional assassin, renown for her ability to kill without much evidence left behind. They band together under the name Noir, which seems to strike fear into the hearts of people as it is a well known organization. The only thing that bonds the two females together is a silver pocketwatch that plays a sad melody when opened. Mireille, the French woman, has seen the watch before, but why and why does Kirika possess such a thing? Mysterious...

Speaking of music, .hack's Yuki Kajiura has produced the music for this anime. For those of you who watched .hack, Yuki's realm of music is techno/opera, a combination of genres that isn't exactly unheard of. After watching the first volume, you might be tempted to go get the soundtrack (I was).

I would give this anime a try if you're looking for something a bit on the dark and intriguing side, I recommend Noir. It does mean black in French after all.",1123718400,4,1639,4.493288590604027
7977399,3,B00007KK2L,"From the descriptions I read of ""Noir,"" and the sleekly designed black DVD, I expected something cutting-edge and urban.  To my disappointment, there is nothing sleek and urban about Noir, except the name.

Professional assassin Mireille works in Paris, taking jobs via e-mail. Mireille is stereotypically blond and blue-eyed.  Her character design looks like it is from the 1980's.  She meets a strange girl with amnesia.  This girl kills without effort.  Mireille teams up with the girl (known as Noir) because Noir has a strangely-designed pocket watch which Mireille remembers from her past.  But Mireille tells the teen, ""We'll work together, but then I'll have to kill you.""  Yeah, riiiiiiiight.

It is hard to have sympathy for either character, as they kill many people without heart.  I can understand Noir a little, yet she committs an extremely heartless act in the fourth episode.  Mireille is a heartless b**ch.

The backdrops of Paris are good.  Obviously the art staff worked very hard.  It is a shame that this DVD, containing five episodes, is full of repetitive music and flashbacks, which repeat themselves endlessly in each episode.

I will keep watching because I want to find out the mystery, but I will not be recommending this series to my friends.

Extras include production art sketches and Japanese promos.  The art sketches are flowing, so you don't have to keep clicking for the next one, which is good, because there are a LOT of sketches.",1121817600,,1469,5.0041322314049586
7977400,1,B00007KK2L,"I'm really confused why so many people give this such a high ranking. I have never reviewed anything or any anime in particular but this anime is asking for a bad review. It takes a lot for me to really hate something but, yeah, Noir did that. There is absolutely no suspense through any of these first episodes and all you see are the main characters staring and staring and staring and staring. Each episode they get a new job to kill some guys. They kill the guys, girl with short hair looks all *sad*, girl with long hair looks *fine*....they go on with their life. Then, next episode, they do the same thing. Over and over and over. The repetition is so awful, I just don't understand how the people who came up with ""Noir"" thought this was a great idea that people would love. The only thing that redeems this anime at all is it's wonderful music- but even that becomes annoying because they repeat the same ""Salva Nos"" song over and over and over again, along with the few other good songs that comprise the anime. Along with the song repetition, all the episodes contain flashbacks to events the viewers already seen, over and over and over. The plot essentially is dusty and dead. Nothing progesses, the characters are pathetically developed, and the animators do their best to reuse old animations and use as much still frames as humanly possible. I just wonder at productions like this and why people like them. Do they feel that any little tad of animation that gets an American English release deserves attention- and MUST be good? Think for yourself and don't just like something for the sake that there are *26 episodes*- so it MUST be great to have that many......lol. I find myself almost being irate and I'm the kind of person who typically hates people who talk like I'm talking right now, but the pure stupidity of Noir warrants this behavior, I think. Anyways, don't waste your money on it. You won't be satisfied, unless you're a fake kind of person who likes anything they watch. Go buy Lain or something.",1104364800,4,2028,4.589531680440771
7977401,4,B00007KK2L,"No Story Line Reveled.
I have watched the entire series and like most TV series some episodes are better then others.
I think the character and plot development throughout the series is great. We learn a little bit more about the characters as time progresses and the plot keeps you guessing up until the end.  Which brings me to my one complaint about the series, the ending.  I will not tell you how it ends but I was disappointed.",1104364800,,433,4.468354430379747
7977402,4,B00007KK2L,"Violent , yet the plot of this anime goes hand-in-hand with what it really represents . Assasins of great prowess and inhuman capabilities ... the creators try to portray the characters as the legend of all assasins and I might admit that they succeded on that feat .

This volume of Noir pretty much starts with a japanese schoolgirl ( Kirika Yuumura ) contacting a French Assasin ( Mireille Boquette ) . Kirika invited Mireille to a pilgrimage with her to the past to try and see what it held for both of them . The only clue that they have to base everything is a musical pocket watch that has a picture of two maidens holding a sword on its cover face . Mireille realizing that the watch is the one her father used to have and the music that resonates from it reminded her of her childhood when she found her parents and brother murdered . Mireille's curiousity was piqued and decided to team up with Kirika and both gathers clues that can tell them of the past and while doing so a lot of people die along the way ...",1094342400,2,1022,4.295336787564767
7977403,4,B00007KK2L,"After watching trailers for Noir I decided to buy the first volume. My impression is that it is everything I thought it would be, only the first volume moves a little slowly. That is no problem because what I have seen so far indicate that it will get much better. Mireille Bouquet is an assassin for hire and is very good at what she does. One day she is contacted by Kirika Yumura, an amnesiac who has to recollection of her past or why she can kill like she does. The two form to join Noir. Mireille will help Kirika in order to uncover things about both of their pasts, and Mireille promises she will kill her once she has found the answers she is searching for. As the two take on a few targets for clients, it becomes evident that someone is after them but they don't know who it would be. That is volume 1 in a nutshell, and though it hasn't gotten really good yet, the gun fights are some of the best I have seen. Especially the first time when Mireille meets Kirika. Add to this a killer soundtrack and you have one stylish work of art. Chicks with guns, great animation and fittingly catchy music--what else needs to be said?

I bought the Vol 1 + series box because it looked cool. The box is of the best quality there is and features great artwork of Mirielle on one side with Kirika shadowed in the background, and Kirika on the other with Mireille in the back. You also get a t-shirt. I only wish the soundtrack had been packed in too. But I am really digging this series so far and I hope to get more volumes soon. It isn't my favorite anime so far, but the characters are great and they have a darker side that shows in their line of work. I definately recommend giving this series a shot.",1090368000,2,1705,4.230061349693251
