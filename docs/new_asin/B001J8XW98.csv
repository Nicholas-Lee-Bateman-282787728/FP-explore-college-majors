8312187,5,B001J8XW98,"Elsewhere I have commented on the text that accompanies this film, published as a book and also available at amazon.  What is remarkable about this film is that it universally condemns human rights violations, be they committed by the right or on the left.  Although the film is a work of fiction, it has the feel of a documentary, and the stories told of torture and brutality move seamlessly between one another.  You will not regret owning this film, and will turn to it often, as a brilliant expos of man's inhumanity to his fellow man.",1418860800,,540,4.604166666666667
