4979419,4,B0068U5Z10,"I love this show.  It's probably the best thing on television and certainly head and shoulders above any other reality competition program.  I'm exceedingly glad to own seasons 2 & 3 on DVD (Where's season 1?!!) but do feel a bit slighted by the lack of popular behind-the-scenes aftershow ""Untucked"" on this DVD release.",1332288000,4,321,4.925925925925926
4979420,5,B0068U5Z10,then most sickening videos ever. i waited sop long for this and at last i have it a dvd set that is so full of all sorts of fierce it is redonk,1330560000,,143,3.5
4979421,5,B0068U5Z10,Purchase went extremely well- delivery was QUICK- dvd format worked in my blue ray player :) Loved the dvd's - so entertaining. And remember if you can't love your self- how the hell ya gunna love somebody else!,1328832000,5,211,4.578947368421052
4979422,5,B0068U5Z10,"Of all the reality shows on TV this is my favorite. It's great fun with a mix of drama, bitchiness, wonderful personalities, different types of drag, guest judges, music, fashion, humor, etc. Season 2's winner is spectacular and the two finalists on Season 3 are so different & great fun to watch. There was a delay of about two weeks to get this two season set but the price made it worth the wait.",1328486400,,399,4.405405405405405

I know they said it would take a while, but.....whats could be going on???",1324857600,3,337,8.36111111111111
4979424,5,B0068U5Z10,This set was definitely the best bang for my buck. I absolutely love this show and they stopped streaming it through Netflix. I was so happy to see that Amazon had a 2 season set for such a great price. I just ordered seasons 4&5 and I already have all stars!,1391644800,,259,4.098039215686274
4979425,1,B0068U5Z10,"This isn't really a review of the content of the show, as my wife loves it.

This is a review of the product itself, the DVD's.  They do not play correctly in either her or my machine, so if you're planning on using it for that, save your money!  The least that could be offered instead would be a digital download.",1388188800,,315,4.131147540983607
4979426,5,B0068U5Z10,"If you want have fun, just buy ! It is really fantastic viewing. Rupaul rocks. She is a true Superstar !",1382140800,,104,4.0
4979427,5,B0068U5Z10,"It's interesting how I've become a Mega fan of this show.  To think I didn't care for Drag Queens and their bitchy attitude to now becoming a fan of them (well, some of them).  All of the RuPaul's Drag Race Seasons have been entertaining and educational.  I have come to appreciate the ART of Drag.  Most important, I have come to respect the work involved and to understand that many of these performers are intelligent, talented and in some cases very good hearted people!

Add, good jokes, performance challenges, attitudes, artistic talent, personal struggles, friendship development, anger development, fashion, color, drama of all sorts and in some cases The Power to Grow as an Individual and Become a Better Person and you have an Amazing Show!!!",1380672000,,754,4.9523809523809526
4979428,5,B0068U5Z10,"love it! wish season 1 was available, but if your a Rupaul fan you MUST have these DVDS of the show.",1377388800,,100,3.8095238095238093
4979429,5,B0068U5Z10,"My family is from a small town in Texas and ever since I came out, my sister has been dying to see a drag show...couldn't think of a better way to introduce her to drag shows than sending her the QUEEN of all drag queens!",1369699200,,221,3.933333333333333
4979430,4,B0068U5Z10,"I like Rupaul's Drag Race.  I can't find much to complain other then I wish they included Untucked and it doesn't work on every DVD player.  I tried to play it on one of my DVD players: it said disc cannot be read.  But if I played it on my PS2, it worked!  It must be because the disc are burned, but I can overlook that.  I do not have LOGO on my cable package hence why I purchased the DVDs. Just be prepared to find an alternative media player if the disc doesn't work.  Support this show and please buy the DVDs.  Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.",1365984000,4,556,3.9107142857142856
4979431,1,B0068U5Z10,"I bought this set thinking I was getting a great deal Well instead I received all of season 3 as nd only one disc of promised 4 of season 2 the case wasn't even built for multiple disks and of course Amazon was conveniently ""out of stock"" and even though they had plenty of season 2 available they wouldn't just replace that season only gave me the option of returning both seasons with no promise of having them available for new purchase or a credit of 8.50$ u failed me Amazon and basically ripped me off thanx sashay away",1363564800,11,525,4.313131313131313
4979432,5,B0068U5Z10,"this is a good deal you get twice the drag for the price of one
can we get the next two seasons like this?",1361491200,,106,3.4583333333333335
4979433,5,B0068U5Z10,I really liked the show and it was a great buy though one of my disks didn't play right in my tv I tried another tv and it worked fine... I never had issues with my tv hooked up to my blue ray player before so idk might be a rare glitch but i'm to lazy to send it back lol and it might be my blue ray player too either way still love it!,1359936000,,337,3.506666666666667
4979434,4,B0068U5Z10,"Watched season 2 & 3 and had a Ru Paul marathon.

The family loves this show. Season 3 by far was the best.",1358812800,,107,3.652173913043478
4979435,4,B0068U5Z10,"Those seasons are probably the best ones!

It's too bad they don't work on computers or laptops, only DVDs :(",1356566400,,109,4.45
4979436,5,B0068U5Z10,I love this show!! Sadly disc 1 of season 3 doesn't play on my dvd player but it plays downstairs on the one we use down there..,1356307200,2,128,3.7777777777777777
4979437,5,B0068U5Z10,"Seasons 2 and 3 of Rupaul's Drag Race were arguably the two most intriguing seasons with some of the highest caliber drag performers out there.  All of the uncensored hilarity and behind the scenes drama are all here.  A nice touch is the audition videos from queens that made it and even the few that did not quite make the cut.  Missing is Untucked, the backstage drama that occurs during judging in the interior illusions lounge.  They are available for instant download however including them on the DVD extras would have been nice .  It seems this has been corrected in the season 4 DVD release so hopefully past seasons might get rereleased with this bonus footage. Overall these DVDs are excellent additions to anyone's collection especially Drag Race fans.  Don't miss out on your chance to cheer on Raven, Pandora, Manilla, Jujubee, Jessica Wild, Raja, Yara, Alexis etc. all over again!",1347235200,8,895,4.855263157894737
4979438,5,B0068U5Z10,"I'm a die hard Drag Race fan, and who can beat spending less than $50 for 2 seasons of one of the greatest shows on tv? The discs are great, the content is great (along with the included bonus material).

The only complaint that I have at all is that for some reason, in season 3 (all of the content is uncensored), when Ru announces the challenge as ""Drag Queens in Outerspace: Return to Uranus"", it's entirely mute and you just see Ru's mouth moving. Kind of odd, but if that's my only complaint, it must be a great product.",1344297600,4,526,4.26
4979439,5,B0068U5Z10,"I've only got 1 thing 2 say...U Betta Order!!!-I sooo LUV RuPaul & everything she does-My package arrived promptly & in good condition,my only complaint is that Ru has yet 2 put out season 1-Hopefully all the rights 4 it will go thru & I'll be able 2 add a very important piece of ''Herstory'' 2 my collection!!!",1338336000,,312,4.396551724137931
4979440,5,B0068U5Z10,"I recently injured my foot, causing me to be out of work for period of time...these two DVDs have provided me with many hours of addictive entertainment! I highly recommend that you purchase season 2 and 3 together because you're gonna be craving to ""see what happens next!"" Also, each season features the reunion episode which is a major plus to fans!!! My only complaint is that season 1 hasn't been released yet!!! Thanks Ru ;)",1334880000,,430,4.671052631578948
4979441,5,B0068U5Z10,"Can't be the price for both seasons. I ordered this with prime but it still took about a week and a half for it to arrive. I love RuPaul and think she is hilarious! I loved re-watching all my favorite people...Raven, the other Tyra, Jujubee, Raja, Manila, Yara Sophia...and yes even Shangela! The show is even funnier when every cuss word isn't bleeped out. I just want LOGO to release season 1 already!!!",1332892800,5,405,4.561643835616438
4979442,5,B0068U5Z10,"So far I have bought through Amazon.com all the seasons of RuPal Dragrace, except the season one. Season one is only available for digital download. I'd love to own my own DVD. Hope it is available soon.",1332460800,2,203,4.513513513513513

8494995,4,B0068U5Z10,"These were almost a perfect 5 star, my only problem I ran into is on the season 2 DVD during *SPOILERS?* Nicole Paige Brooks and Ravens Lip sync it totally freezes and I can't watch it, I have to skip past it. But other then that I love these DvDs! :)",1499817600,,251,3.9411764705882355

The DVDs work fine, the menus are well designed if simple, and the audio quality is superb. If I had to complain, it would be that there's no option for captions.",1478131200,,250,4.340425531914893

8495004,5,B0068U5Z10,I bought Season 2 for Pandora Boxx & she did not disappoint. I bought Season 3 for Yara Sofia who I absolutely adore. The rest of the Queens on the seasons were lovely too.
