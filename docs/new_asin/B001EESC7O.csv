8297972,3,B001EESC7O,"But it's not because 1, it came crushed and 2, several of the disc's are defective.  So because of the major glitches we can't even watch them!  However it is a wonderful series, if you get a working set!",1494979200,,204,4.205128205128205
8297973,5,B001EESC7O,"All 7 seasons, 121 episodes (363 segments plus Quickies), on 15 DVDs in 15 slim cases, in 5 box sets, of Garfield and Friends; all International prints since every show renames U.S. Acres as Orson's Farm, since most people outside the USA wouldn't get this gag. All of which aren't made new anymore, Heaven knows why, other than Anderson Digital being in charge of Garfield's 2D-animated works now. If this link still had new copies, you can go ahead and collect them all, and kill 2 birds with 1 stone, as the old saying goes. Just read my reviews, or other people's, on these sets separately, to get a much better idea of what you and your families are in for with this iconic series! You'll never know what you'll find here on Amazon, for anybody's tastes and interests!",1432684800,4,773,4.568345323741007
