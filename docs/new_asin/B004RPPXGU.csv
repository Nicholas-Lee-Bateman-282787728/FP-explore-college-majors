She has recommended it to all her friends and bought it for a few.  The great thing about this video is that it features all the local birds in California and is narrated in a humorous yet informative way.",1449014400,,345,4.044117647058823
8439164,2,B004RPPXGU,"I did not like the music, it's to loud and makes it hard to hear the speaker or the birds. Expected to hear the birds not music or I would buy a music CD.  Did not care for the part about ducks, either. When I purchased it at a local bird they said it would ID birds in my backyard, well I don't have duck!",1434844800,,306,3.707692307692308

As a garden-putterer and non-birder, I expected a nature talk that would be pleasantly interesting and moderately entertaining for an hour.  As expected, the video featured close footage of birds found in most of our California backyards.  However, the birds, their songs and interactions were beautifuly captured and presented with Mr. Kersey's commentary on bird identification and habits, along with music that was often amusingly timed.  The photography was so close and so crisp that a bird cocking its head and looking at you from the screen made you feel you were there with it as it made eye contact with the camera.  At times no voiceover or music track was used or needed -- just the birds were featured, set in perfect light and singing or interacting with one another.  It reminded me of the nature that we interact with daily and yet often unaware, and reconnected me with the feeling of beauty and fragility of worlds and beings interconnected with and deeply affected by us, who affect us deeply as well.  I bought the video along with almost everyone else who saw it.  I would think children would be fascinated and want to go find the birds they see in the video, and I found it captivating as an adult.",1316390400,4,1459,5.258620689655173

I'm not a birder myself, but I found the narration fascinating. The filmmaker described the habits and characteristics of different families of birds. I really liked it!!",1304726400,3,289,4.918367346938775
