8173544,5,B000F5S1XI,"Recorded in ' 82 for the german TV in a TV studio packed with a wild punk audience, this 39' dvd is nothing short of UNBELIEVABLE !!! Superbly multi-camera shot and edited, PERFECT 4:3 pic and near-perfect sound put most modern dvd concerts to shame !! Don't expect a theatre's light-set though, it's brightly lit most of the time. The performance is inspired; the lineup is the original minus Steve Roberts and guitarrist Nicky Garrat is in top form perfoming his trademark jumping acrobatics without missing a note (saw him doing EXACTLY the same in 2001 !! what are these guys on ?!) Kim Wylie is a competent drummer and his kit is dismally minimalistic but he still gets away with it !! Ahhh,I own hundreds of concert dvds; if only HALF of them were as good as this one I'd be the happiest rocker on earth !!
The extras are just a photo gallery and 2 bad sounding songs from a live 2001 set but who gives a f.... !! Be warned, this is a HIGHLY biased review since I've been a Subs freak for 25 years now and I own ALL of their material.
On a final note this dvd's been released by novel polish label Noise Annoys and impeccably manufactured in Poland ! Way to go people !!!(please treat us to some kind of booklet/insert next time please) There's no tracklist on the box but there are videograph texts at the beginning of each song, and BTW the setlist is unusually unusual even for 1982, lotsa non-hits which I'm very fond of. Bring on some more material dudes !!",1193875200,2,1468,4.400735294117647
