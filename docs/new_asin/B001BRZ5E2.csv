Playing seven different characters in one film is an actor's dream, that Shirley pulls off with great ease.  All the stories are short and sweet, portraying characters that are sad, vulnerable and downright hilarious!  My favorite character is ""Eve"", Shirley's natural comic timing is pure perfection and you can't help laughing with her at the surprise ending!  The lovely score by Riz Ortolani compliments the film beautifully.",1365897600,,568,5.130434782608695

Each vignette was more boring than the preceding one and it was torture to sit through to the end.  I will never buy another DVD of a movie I haven't seen.  The acting was terrible; the dialogue was wretched and even Paris seemed dismal.  I've just ordered The Yellow Rolls Royce, Can-Can and The Trouble with Harry, in all of which Shirley MacLaine was delightful.  What in the world happened here??",1232236800,6,481,4.482758620689655
3497890,4,B001BRZ5E2,"In the sixties, the Italian cinema that was at a height had particular tendency to produce episodic movies such as ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" (1964) (all three episodes directed by Vittorio DeSica and winner of the Foreign Film Oscar) and ""Boccaccio '70"" (1962) (with episodes by different directors: Fellini, Visconti and DeSica).  DeSica (who was best known for ""The Bicycle Thief"" (1949) was considered ""superb"" and an auteur.  He also acted before the camera in, for example, 1965's and Paramount's ""The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders"" starring Kim Novak.

DeSica became somewhat Americanized with his success and in 1966 directed Peter Sellers in a Neil Simon written script, ""After the Fox.""  In 1967, he supplied Shirley MacLaine with a showcase of seven different roles in a series of episodes that, as with these episodic films, some are better than others but generally this batch are genuinely touching on the whole, all dealing with the general theme of ""adultery.""  Peter Sellers, the great (and under-rated) Alan Arkin, Anita Ekberg and Michael Caine are some of her co-stars in a script by Cesare Zavattini (the author of some of DeSica best known films (including two of Sophia Loren's best: ""Two Women"" and ""Marriage, Italian Style"") and lush parisienne music by Riz Ortolani (whose forgotten masterpiece from ""The Yellow Rolls-Royce"" (in which MacLaine had a part),""Forget Domani"" should surely be re-released).  Best of the episodes, however, and perhaps worth the cost of the DVD is the final one, ""Snow"" in which Shirley and Anita Ekberg are followed by Michael Caine (MacLaine has a charming naivete about her as she realizes the stranger following them is indeed interested in her (of the two when they decide to test him by splitting up), ""Jean"" (MacLaine's character in ""Snow"") who never thought to cheat on her husband (because she ""never found anyone better than her husband"") becomes enamoured by the idea.  As it begins to snow, leaving their footprints, it never connects with her that he is her absurdly jealous husband's detective ""tail.""  What she gathers from this ""imagined?"" un-encounter should be savored.  It being the ending episode, the fabulous music swells up for the end credits and marks a sense of having watched a grand film.",1225756800,7,2281,5.126684636118599
3497891,3,B001BRZ5E2,"I've enjoyed this movie for years, seeing it in various incarnations, either on television (cut and edited depending on society's mores at the time) and also on video (where it was released years ago).  The seven stories are entertaining and some do really touch you.  However, I did noticed that some of the original dialogue has been cut, particularly during the Eve segment.  I guess when they re-released this on DVD, the studio felt that the audience of 2008 couldn't handle Eve using the ""B word"" over the telephone to her fashion rival or telling her husband that she doesn't go to be with frightened yellow chickens.  True, in the scheme of the universe, the cutting of a word here or there is inconsiquential, but when one has seen this film so many times, its kind of like hitting a speed bump.",1224460800,18,804,4.640845070422535

3497893,4,B001BRZ5E2,"If you love Shirley MacLaine, chances are you'll really like WOMAN TIMES SEVEN (1967), one of her more offbeat movies, directed by Vittorio De Sica.  In the movie she plays in seven different vignettes strung together by the themes of love and revenge.

While you might think this movie to be a re-tread of MacLaine's 1964 comedy ""What a Way to Go!"", WOMAN TIMES SEVEN is a more understated, European flavoured film experience.  With the aid of several wigs, Ms MacLaine successfully shifts between seven different women.  Each one tells a very special story.

My favourites include Edith, the housewife trying to compete with her author husband's (Lex Barker) exciting fictional heroines; Maria Teresa, who tries getting revenge on her cheating husband (Rossano Brazzi) by becoming a hooker; and Eve Minou, determined to outshine her arch-rival (Adrienne Corri) during a night at the opera!  The final story is the most poignant one.  In ""Snow"", Jeanne is followed by a handsome young stranger (MacLaine's ""Gambit"" costar Michael Caine), though he's actually a private detective employed by Jeanne's husband...and has also fallen in love with her.

There's equal moments of hilarity and heartache in these stories of seven different shades of womanhood, and you're bound to find your own personal favourites within the mix.  The musical score by Riz Ortolani is absolutely gorgeous; and the costumes created by Marcel Escoffier represent the 1960's at it's glamorous--and outlandish--best.

Lionsgate/StudioCanal will be releasing this often-requested title on September 16.  Fans of Shirley MacLaine will adore seeing it again, but I hope casual viwers will also give it a spin.  Highly-recommended.",1215129600,30,1701,5.353383458646617

8284340,3,B001BRZ5E2,"Review of ""Woman Times Seven""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

There are two types of movies that came out of the 1960s: strange, experimental films and lusciously colored films that made later generations ask, Were the sixties really like that?

Woman Times Seven is a mixture of both, which would be a reason to watch it, if you're interested in different types of classic films. The movie has beautiful costumes, lavish colors, and oddly 60s music; and at the same time, its strange and experimental. Seven completely unrelated short storieseach about infidelityare played out, all starring Shirley MacLaine! She really is darling, so if you want to see her in various wigs and furs, and with beautiful expressions from heavily made up eyes, you won't want to miss this one.

The vignettes themselves aren't really all that good. Shirley has several different costars, including Peter Sellars, Alan Arkin, Rossano Brazzi, and Michael Caine. But the plots vary from silly to stalker-y to sad. Its not the best movie out there, but it won't hurt you if you want to see pretty people up on the screen.",1498435200,,1099,4.866310160427807

8284345,3,B001BRZ5E2,"WOMAN TIMES SEVEN is one of those portmanteau films beloved of filmmakers of the Fifties and Sixties linked by an abstract theme or authorial voice. In this case, it is adultery.

Shirley MacLaine gets the chance to show off her acting talent in seven different roles ranging from a mousy homemaker to a translator-turned-vamp, a shrewish society lady, and a middle-aged Parisian pursued by a strange man. Sometimes she is more effective than others; she reveals her talent for dancing as well as nonverbal comedy. The film is quite risqu for the late Sixties, as it has her appearing nude in one of the sequences, although director De Sica ensures that she is most tastefully shot, revealing nothing of her charms for lascivious viewers.

Of the seven playlets, ""Funeral Procession"" is quite droll, with Peter Sellers reprising his role from the previous year's WHAT'S NEW, PUSSYCAT? as a lecher trying yet failing to persuade a widow (MacLaine) to sleep with him. In ""Super Simone"" Lex Barker plays a successful novelist so obsessed with his fictional character Simone and her sexual exploits that he remains immune to his wife's (MacLaine's) entreaties - that is, until she initiates some outrageous stunts, including having their evening meal served by an African dressed in tribal clothing. ""At the Opera"" has MacLaine as a society lady fond of shouting at everyone who is eventually trumped by the sight of one of her deadliest rivals (Adrienne Corri) having the same style of dress designed for her. The anthology rounds off with Michael Caine in a nonspeaking role working for a rich Parisian (Philippe Noiret) jealous of his wife (MacLaine).

The film incorporates some of the sexist values characteristic of a pre-feminist era: women mostly exist to serve their husbands, both socially as well as sexually. Yet such archaism is redeemed somewhat by the atmospheric photography (by Christian Matras) that captures Paris's romanticism and enduring attraction.",1460160000,,1967,5.15987460815047
