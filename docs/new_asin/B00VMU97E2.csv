It's criminal that this film has been allowed to fall out of circulation in the U.S. But this Spanish import is certainly worth purchasing. Be advised: Naturally, this Blu-Ray edition automatically defaults to Spanish so you'll need to go into the menu and select the English setting if you don't want to view the dubbed version. Brilliant performances and a decidedly noir vibe lurking beneath a great newspaper morality tale and excellent paced crime drama.",1438992000,4,529,5.0227272727272725
8710619,5,B00VMU97E2,"As advertised, it plays on Region A blu-ray players.  Fully restored and the blu-ray HD quality is awesome for a black and white classic film.  Since it was made for Spain, the default language is Spanish so make sure you switch audio to English.  Once that's done, you'd swear you were watching a US blu-ray.  Great to see and old classic restored and on blu-ray, a must buy for Bogie fans!",1434758400,4,391,4.464788732394366
