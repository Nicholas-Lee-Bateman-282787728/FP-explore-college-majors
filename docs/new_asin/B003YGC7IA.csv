4229253,4,B003YGC7IA,"I was about to buy the old collection set a couple of months ago when I saw this one was coming out and decided to wait since it essentially had all the movies in the series.  I'm still watching the last few movies, but this is a review about the product and not the movies.  Most would have seen them or heard plenty of plot reviews from other sources already.  Though I will note the movie quality seems pretty good.  So anyway, the DVD's come in 3 volumes, with 3 movies in each volume.  I love that each movie gets their own disk (none of that double-sided or multiple-movies-in-one-disk stuff!).  I like the scroll design on the disks too.  The only reason I'm giving this a 4-star is because the box itself is pretty plain.  It would have been nice to have some texture or 2D aspects to it.  Or even a stronger box in general.  All in all for the Amazon price, I'm pretty happy though.",1290124800,3,891,4.281437125748503
4229254,5,B003YGC7IA,"This set comes with every puppet master other than PM vs. demonic toys, so if you're looking to add this series to your collection, go with this box set. If you're a huge puppet master fan, you may want to wait for the official re-releases, as full moon is supposed to release the puppet master catalog on blu ray sometime in the future. This set is basically quality VHS transfers, so they are in full screen. I also own the first one on blu ray, and it is very good quality if you want to wait for the rest. I would rather just go for this box set, as it is very fairly priced, and the slight graininess adds to the nostalgia for me. The set comes with three dvd cases, with 3 discs in each case so that each movie is on its own disc. Also has the video zone special features, which includes the making of several of the films and loads of other previews and old school full moon stuff.",1289865600,23,888,4.138728323699422
4229255,4,B003YGC7IA,"I like that you are getting 10 movies for this price, but at the same time, it's not the FULL collection. The other movie in the series is Puppet Master VS Demonic Toys. Granted, I still would have bought this is if I knew for sure that, that movie wasn't in this collection because I wanted the Puppet Master movies. I do understand why though, that movie isn't in the collection, and it probably has something to do with syfy (sci-fi) owning the rights to the movie, but still. So, just remember if you buy this, you are missing one, so buy that one somewhere else if you want ALL the movies.",1289606400,4,594,4.3125
4229256,5,B003YGC7IA,"I love this set. I like to buy box sets of movies for the fact that I can usually find them for much cheaper. This set does not disappoint. The box set comes with three standard sized DVD cases inside, and there are three disks to a case. They are their own disk. no double sided discs here. the picture quality and audio is great. The three films equal to approximately 12 Hours and 48 minutes (not including the time for the extras). For the money, this set is well worth it if you enjoyed the movies growing up. I won't bother listing the movies in this set because someone else has kindly done that as well as described each movie.",1289260800,30,635,4.256198347107438
4229257,4,B003YGC7IA,"The Puppet Master series is a fantastic collection of films which will raise the pulse of any b movie fan. This is just a simple review of the films themelves, once I get the set I will review the other aspects( features, video, audio etc..)

PUPPET MASTER:  In director David Schmoeller's taut chiller, perverse master puppeteer Andre Toulon  harnesses the power of ancient Egyptian magic to breathe life into his crew of marionettes, who morph into demonic killers. Many years later, a group of modern psychics looking for clues to explain a mutual friend's mysterious suicide end up trapped in a creepy hotel stalked by Toulon's miniature assassins.

PUPPET MASTER 2: HIS UNHOLY CREATIONS: A gang of ghoulish, supernatural puppets uses an Egyptian brain serum to resurrect their long-dead creator, Andre Toulon , who promptly orders his marionette minions to drain the brains of a team of scientists. Meanwhile, Toulon falls for Carolyn , whom he believes to be the reincarnation of his lost love. Pinhead, Leech Woman, Blade and Tunneler are all back for more in this gory sequel

PUPPET MASTER 3: TOULON'S REVENGE:  French puppeteer Andre Toulon  attracts the Nazis' attention with his anti-Hitler productions, which feature a cast of magical string-free marionettes. The Gestapo promptly kill his wife  and pursue Toulon's animation formula to create a zombie army. Enlisting the help of his faithful creations, Toulon pulls the strings on a very gory revenge plan in this clever prequel to the first two films in the horror franchise.

PUPPET MASTER 4: THE DEMON :  With the help of a psychic, scientist Rick  and his cohorts find the trunk of dead French puppeteer Andre Toulon. Its contents include several amazing puppet creations -- and an ancient animation serum stolen from Egyptian wizards. Rick injects the puppets, who are reanimated just in time to battle a team of ruthless demons sent to reclaim the serum in this bloody-good fourth installment of the popular cult horror franchise.

PUPPET MASTER 5: THE FINAL CHAPTER: Charged with protecting the magical puppets of Andre Toulon, Rick must face off against minions sent by the evil Dr. Jennings and a demon beast sent from the Netherworld. Luckily, Blade, Six Shooter, Pinhead, Decapitron and the rest of the puppet gang are loyal to their new master and ready for battle in the cult franchise's fifth installment, which features special effects by ace stop-motion animator David W. Allen.

PUPPET MASTER 6: CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER:  In the sixth installment of the Puppet Master horror series, we follow the evil Dr. Magrew  as he foolishly attempts to re-create the genius of puppet master Andre Toulon, whose puppets he now owns. Toulon's puppets have watched silently as Magrew experimented on his own assistant and performed all sorts of atrocities to achieve that end. Now, they're ready to give Magrew a taste of his own medicine.

PUPPET MASTER 7: RETRO PUPPET MASTER: In this prequel to the horror franchise, it's 19th-century Paris, and a young Andre is visited by a 3,000-year-old sorcerer who shares the ancient secret of installing the souls of the dying into inanimate objects. The problem is that the secret has been stolen from a god -- and the god wants it back.

PUPPET MASTER: THE LEGACY:  Eighth in a series, This installment centers on recurring character Eric Weiss , who, now an adult, is determined to discover Andr Toulon's secrets for bringing inanimate objects to life. Eric tells a beauty named Maclain  all he knows of Toulon's dark arts, unaware that Maclain hides dark secrets of her own.

PUPPET MASTER: AXIS OF EVIL:  As World War II rages, Danny  dreams of battling Nazis and becoming a real hero. When he discovers an Axis plot to destroy a key U.S. facility, Danny teams with a group of vicious and deadly puppets to derail the enemy invaders. Set in Los Angeles, this horror film largely eschews computer-generated visual effects in favor of traditional puppets, which heighten the film's frightening sense of reality.",1288569600,57,4028,5.016516516516517

4229260,5,B003YGC7IA,"I am a big fan of the Puppet Master series (particularly 1-5).  This is a solid collection of the first nine movies, all of which are on their own DVD, making the transfer quality better than on other sets.  There are several collections out there that compress multiple movies onto one DVD, but the transfer quality on those sets is terrible.  The transfer quality on this set is easily the best.

All the DVDs come with special features, including old episodes of Video Zone, Full Moon's video magazine.  These episodes contain information on the Puppet Master movies (behind the scenes) as well as information on other Full Moon movies that came out at the time.  I really enjoyed them and learned about other Full Moon series like Subspecies and Trancers.  I also learned about Castle Freak, a movie I am interested in seeing if not just for the campy title.

I highly recommend this set to anyone interested in collecting the Puppet Master series.  This set is more expensive than others, but the overall quality of picture and sound as well as the inclusion of special features make it well worth the price.",1412121600,,1113,4.725388601036269

The special features were good too. They add to any dvd. I am always disapointed when they are absent.  When they'e missing in season 1 of a series like M*A*S*H* Mission Impossible I do not buy any other season. I'm  disapointed 21 Jump Street does not have any special features.",1345075200,,510,3.9607843137254903

It has every puppet master movie, with the exception of Puppet Master Vs Demonic Toys, in one box set and for next to nothing as box set prices go. For those of you who have not seen the show, I'm sure you've heard that these movies are riddled with horrible acting, horrible actors, and some of the story lines are kind of blah. Yet you will also find that this is still to this day considered one of the best B movie franchises out there. This is because of the main stars of the show, The Puppets! From what is seen in most of the movies, the main force of the budget went into creating and animating these marionettes.

This is a new transfer and it looks great.  Moreover it is displayed in it's original widescreen aspect.  There was however one major disappointment for me.  I am partially deaf and there are no subtitles or closed captions.  These have become pretty much standard on all DVD's now.

Puppet Master II - IX
These films share the problem of no subtitles or closed captions AND are shown in the older television ratio of 4:3 (the screen is boxed on the left and right sides).  While you can use most PC DVD software to show it full screen you will lose the aspect and if you turn on Pan and Scan software to correct the aspect, you will lose the top and bottom of the frames.

Each film was given its own DVD, with 3 DVDs to a case. Case 1 contains PUPPET MASTER (1989), PUPPET MASTER II (1991) and PUPPET MASTER III: TOULON'S REVENGE (1991). Extras include making-of featurettes for 1, 2 and 3, as well as a bunch of trailers for other Full Moon shiz. Case 2 contains PUPPET MASTER 4 (1993), PUPPET MASTER 5: THE FINAL CHAPTER (1994) and CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER (1998). Extras include Full Moon Video Zones, the making of part 4 and trailers. Case 3 contains RETRO PUPPET MASTER (1999), PUPPET MASTER: THE LEGACY (2003) and PUPPET MASTER: AXIS OF EVIL (2010). Extras here include more Full Moon Video Zones, the making of Axis of Evil and trailers for all nine of the movies. Transfers look great (Part 1 looks remastered, the rest seem to be transfered as was, but even Part 2, which looks the worst, is still on par with new VHS quality). Some of the the supplements, like the Full Moon trailers, are kinda grainy and old. But they're good enough. And, all in all, it's a great collection for fans of the series.

The price I paid at Amazon was a good deal = $3 per movie!!!!Get this set while you can if you want the Puppet Master movies on dvd. Now to update on this review :The last disc ""Axis of Evil"" is in Letterbox too! 235.1 aspect ratio (Same as Cinemascope) very cool! However ""Legacy "" (eight disc) is just scenes cut from all the other Puppet Master movies with very little new content. All in all,I'm glad I got this set!",1298073600,2,682,4.174242424242424

I would certainly recommend the 4th film with the gremlins.  Got a few laughs out of that one.  Again a classic and must see for horror fans.",1293408000,,411,4.1645569620253164
