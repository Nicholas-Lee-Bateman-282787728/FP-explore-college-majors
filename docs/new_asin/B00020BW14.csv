2051853,5,B00020BW14,"I rented this movie with Net Flix and it is a great movie. I'm definitely going to buy this in the future.  I love storms and I found this an entertaining movie.  You can tell the tornados were computer generated and didn't look like they do in real life, but I'm not a picky person and I still found them to look real enough.  The movie ""Twister"" that everyone is familiar with had more realistic looking tornados, but ""Devil Winds"" is still a great movie.  I liked the characters, the story, etc. Great movie!",1092355200,30,511,4.404255319148936
2051854,5,B00020BW14,"I just got my DVD of Devil Winds and it is awesome.  Joe Lando(Dr. Quinn, Higher Ground) is still a hottie.  The storyline is very plausible and the CGIs look like a real tornado was happeining.  The chemistry between Pete (Joe) and Julia (Nicole Eggert) could have been explored more, but there is alot of action to make up for it.  If you like ""disaster"" type movies, I think this one will become a favorite to watch.",1088553600,20,419,4.402597402597403
2051895,5,B00020BW14,"This has been the most accurate to date film of real life tragedy by tornado. Sure, you have a bit of drama, but put yourself in the shoes of the victims... They somehow lived through it to tell their stories. I live in Oklahoma and have seen the sun shine one second... And have seen the sky fall down upon everything I loved in just a heartbeat later... I give this film infinite stars for the way they played out. No hype, just true, real events. Thank you for my viewing pleasure... Well worth every penny I spent. The Moore tornado... Was one mile wide, carving a path of over thirty miles... Tell me. Tell me to calm down... Things will always get worse... Before they get better. Trust you gut...",1505779200,,703,4.374045801526718

2052032,2,B00020BW14,"Watch for the story, maybe, there's one there. But you won't see a lot of disaster at all, and what you get is poorly done.

A really good disaster movie with good special effects and plenty of havoc/nature's fury doesn't need the best story.

It depends on one's tastes. If I had to pick, I'd take the good disaster movie with little story. I did not get that here.

A couple tornados and they were really poorly done. Uggh.",1409788800,,425,4.3544303797468356

2052034,3,B00020BW14,Joe Lando always satisfies in a movie or television show. This show was good ... not a Dr. Quinn ... but good.,1381276800,,110,4.045454545454546

2052036,5,B00020BW14,"Bought this because I'm a fan of Joe Lando from his days as  Sully on Dr. Quinn, Medicine woman. He did not disappoint me in this one. He was heroic and handsome (even with his long locks from Sully days gone).  The rest of the cast was also very good and the story was well written if not the most original.",1375488000,,308,4.032786885245901

2052040,5,B00020BW14,I am not good at writing reviews. I had never seen this before. I just know what I like. I bought this because Joe Lando was in it.  He is a very talented actor and can play anything. I would recommend this product to anyone.,1357344000,,225,4.0
2052041,5,B00020BW14,"If you saw ""Twister"" & liked it, you should enjoy this, as well. Not the big-budjet effects here, but a very good story, acting is good, too. Joe Lando is very good in his role, as usual. Pop some corn, gather the family, & enjoy.",1354838400,,230,4.133333333333334
2052042,5,B00020BW14,I watch this movie on Netflix I like it so much decide to buy a copy to add to my collection. very good story line. Acting very good. It one of those few movies that there was nothing that I dislike,1302134400,,198,3.8536585365853657
2052043,3,B00020BW14,"When viewed simply as a story, I found the movie to be satisfactory.  However, it did have a lot of footage of things you DO NOT do during a tornado...walking /running around in the debris field, leaving places of shelter, taking refuge in a culvert or under a bridge.  These things are deadly, and in my opinion, the movie should have had a disclaimer to not do these things during a tornado.  Of course a culvert is preferable to an open field, as is a bridge...but in Oklahoma, they have been proven to be deadly.",1291680000,,516,4.410526315789474
2052044,3,B00020BW14,"DEVIL WINDS is full of all the cliches you expect in this kind of movie:  a tornado expert miscalls a tornado and loses his wife in the process; a buxom up and coming reporter wants to make it to the bigtime; a new viral investigation clinic is built and may be in the path of a horrible twister, but the director vows to keep things going; and the hero has a daughter who blames him for her mother's death and doesn't want anything to do with him.  But still, DEVIL WINDS succeeds due to a pleasant cast and computer-generated tornadoes that are pretty awesome, even if they don't look totally real.  It's a movie and for a lower budgeted film, the fx team does okay.  Joe Lando (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Combustion) does a staunch job as the hero and Baywatch's Nicole Eggert, looking a little heftier and unglamorous than usual, does okay too.  Not as high quality as TWISTER, but still entertaining.",1109030400,19,904,4.521472392638037

In addition to this, the acting was excellent and the characters were well developed. All in all this is one of the best disaster movies I've seen!
