7311002,5,B010H6NMKQ,Excellent and much needed information.  We need to be informed consumers! This movie lays the ground work in an entertaining way; but it is serious non-the-less.  Just the push I needed to get our family back to a Paleo way of eating.  Thank you.,1438387200,9,246,4.545454545454546
7311003,5,B010H6NMKQ,"An eye opener.  I decided to watch this after being hooked on the documentary FED UP.  I am almost 4 months Sugar Free now but decided to educate myself even further, that I would watch The Sugar Film!  Well, yet another eye opener.  I loved the fact that this shows the physical mayhem that sugar does to the body.  Much like Super Size me, following Damon's 3 month journey of consuming the daily average of sugar and watching his health and body deteriorate was alarming.  If you watch this and this isn't a wake up call for you, then you are really just doing an ""assisted suicide"" in my eyes.",1438387200,17,597,4.381818181818182
7311004,4,B010H6NMKQ,"That Sugar Film is sort of like Supersize Me with a lot more information from experts, combined with a documentary told in a fun way about the problem modern society has with the diet the majority of us eat.  I think most people would know that eating a lot of sugar isn't a good idea for your health, but there are still people you come across in a group conversation or something who believe fruit juice is good for you, or that muesli bars, breakfast cereal and so on are healthy for you simply because the packaging has a picture of an orange, or large font text that talks about the miniscule benefits it gives you if you have a poor diet and don't eat any fruit or vegetables to get them naturally anyway.

I found the narrator and subject of the self experiment Damon Gameau to be a lot more credible and knowledgeable about the bigger issue than Morgan Spurlock came across in Supersize Me.  The film also interviews a wider range and larger number of experts at different locations, as well as throws in the odd celebrity such as Stephen Fry, Hugh Jackman, every now and then which made it more entertaining than your lecture style documentary.  Gameau in his eating challenge displayed quite well at times the amount of sugar in something by simply eating something else and piling the amount of sugar on top so you could visually see what you would have been eating (or worse drinking) with the volume of sugar clearly there on the screen.  There's a lot of fun visuals throughout the film, the cover artwork is an example of the type of sight gags you see emphasising what we're eating along with visuals such as a supermarket as it is found today and then pretty much empty shelves when every product with sugar in it was removed.

The downsides to the film are that there is a lot of information in it, it's a lot to take in and remember everything, you've constantly got a new expert with new facts every couple of minutes.  It was never really clear at the time Damon's new diet began what Damon was actually eating before he took on the diet the rest of us normally consume.  He told us when he met his girlfriend, like all guys do he faked an interest in eating healthy but we don't see what the new life diet wise his girlfriend has made him eat between then and now. Therefore it was hard to fathom the changes he was feeling, behaving and effects on his liver when I had no idea how much healthier than the eating norm (ie me) was his base.  His being affected by the minute amount of sugar his new diet consisted of wasn't relatable to me since drinking a can of soft drink or something with a lot of sugar doesn't make me hyper or anything like this, or have any noticeable change at all.  Damon's changes were more like something I've only seen in a cartoon or TV sitcom after a character eats sugar before so it may have been better to have had a everyday person along as well doing the same thing so it would have been the opposite, cutting down their sugar intake or something.

Also, especially when the documentary moved across to the US, a lot of the experts lecturing us on what we should consume or the evils of the soft drink and junk food companies were obese individuals, some even morbidly so, so I questioned do they really know what they are talking about since at the very least they obviously don't practice what they preach. For me the obvious thing missing was the importance of exercise and the reality that a lot of people eating the same diet (bad one) that Damon was on who are physically active don't have any health problems or at least the ones he suddenly had while on the experiment. There's also a bit of politics thrown in on the slashing of money handed out to indigenous communities with a Northern Territory community seeming to go off the health rails because the wads of cash stopped so they no longer had the ability to know not to purchase soft drink and other unhealthy foods.  That sort of came across as a bit racist in the fact that it inferred they aren't intelligent enough to remember what they used to do without  having the cash to employ a non indigenous person to remind them each time they go to the shops.

There's a lot of extras on the DVD (Australian version anyway, Amazon hasn't listed product info at the time of this review for their not released yet product) including a Q & A session where Damon answers questions such as why is alcohol not mentioned in the film, are you really saying people shouldn't eat fruit, and a heap of others.  Damon does a good job of answering these or clarifying what maybe what wasn't clear in the film itself, plus it was a good reminder of something you may have forgotten with so many messages in the film.

There's also a lot of mini documentaries which I'm guessing are the 'boring parts' Damon outlines in the Q & A session they had to cull from the film to get it down to 98 minutes that you may have read in the book (before the film came out there was a book called That Sugar Book just in case you were unaware).

Overall for a documentary this is a pretty watchable and fun film on an obviously serious problem modern society has.",1438128000,51,5153,4.3960084033613445
7311005,5,B010H6NMKQ,The truth is in the pudding. This documentary was very well done and leaves no question unanswered about sugar. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who has struggled with losing weight and keeping it off.

7311014,5,B010H6NMKQ,"So entertaining, I would say it's like getting your medicine with a spoonful of sugar, except that after watching this documentary, that saying won't have it's intended effect anymore.  Very useful health information in a highly entertaining format.  This proves the  ""calories in and calories out"" theory of losing weight to be a big, fat lie. Through his film, Damon Gameau shows that the hidden sugars in all those so-called 'health foods' make it impossible to maintain your health and your body weight, without addressing the sugar. What I found most fascinating? That he ate the same number of calories before and after - yet had a dramatically different result when he got rid of the sugar. A must see!",1529884800,,709,4.891666666666667

7311016,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This has been mind blowing. I've been amending my diet incrementally over the past few years, and sugar is something I have accidentally cut out for large chunks of time due to where I've lived and certain jobs I've worked. Thinking back over those times, I've been mentally clearer and I felt better. Props to Damon for his hard work and careful research. We evolved without it, so what made us think we could healthily consume copious amounts of it?
I highly recommend this documentary. I know ""Supersize Me"" was a big hit, but this is far more condemning and powerful. Thanks Damon!",1529539200,,585,4.689320388349515

7311024,5,B010H6NMKQ,"I'm writing this review as a Response to what I've been seeing from a lot of people on this issue since as far back as 2009 when Gary Taubes came on the scene.  This review is going to be a bit long, but, I hope you all stick to it.  First off, this documentary was fun, informative, and important.  It really shows how much sugar has infiltrated our lives, even in the attempt to eat healthy.  Sugar may, one day, be regulated far more than it is today, and that will help a lot of lives.  The documentary is informative, it's fun to watch, it keeps you interested, and gives you the information in a fun and straight forward way.

Now, onto critics.  Many complain that he gained the weight while eating the same amount of calories, thus contradicting the belief that a calorie is a calorie.  Having struggled with obesity my entire life, read every study, been a Vegan, a Vegetarian, and a low carb eater at various stages of my life, and each time, documented each of the processes and all of the information, I hope I can explain this to you.

1) Nutrient Density, 200 calories of Spinach is incredibly different than 200 calories of steak, there's 200 calories in 3 ounces of steak, there's 29 ounces in 200 calories of spinach.  Foods have different density and nutrient values and they effect your body different.

2) Hormones control weight gain and weight loss, otherwise there'd never be naturally skinny people, and everyone would just be fat or skinny based solely on what they eat.  There are studies showing naturally skinny people eating 1,000 extra calories a day and over a week not gaining weight, we know that hormones effect weight gain.  To make this clearer for you, your hormones, mostly insulin and cortisol and leptin are balancers to your metabolism.  This is why a Good night sleep is important to weight loss (keep cortisol levels down), why avoiding sugars and refined carbs are good (keeps insulin levels down), and why having re-feed days on a diet plan are good (refuel the leptin after calorie cutting).  When I dropped 90 lbs I did it without a single plateau (after years and years of plateauing) all thanks to knowing how to keep my hormones balanced.  When they're imbalanced, this is where people see weight gain while feeling like they're doing everything right, and this is where frustration comes from.

3) Bodybuilders Are The Most Calorie Conscious People In The World:  People like to point out that athletes and especially bodybuilders use calorie deficits.  They ignore that they don't blindly eat calories.  From Sumo Wrestlers to Body Builders to world class athletes, they're all focused on the quality of calorie they're putting in their body, and then the quantity second.  The food they're eating is specific to a goal.  On cutting periods, bodybuilders eat high protein with structured carbo-loading to keep their glycogen reserves and recovery time as high and fast as possible.  It is nearly a full time job for those who are cooking for bodybuilders, as the food has to be properly weighed, the fat has to be cut off, even the seasoning (use of butter, salt, or anything that cause water retention or anything else) is measured specifically and perfectly.  To claim these people are just cutting calories, or when bulking up, adding calories, and that calories in and calories out are all that matter to a bodybuilder, you are either lying, or woefully uninformed.

Now onto the film.  The average person in America eats about 120 to 150 pounds of sugar a year, up from the 10 pounds of sugar they ate in 1822.  70 to 80% of all products have sugar in them.  There's a difference between the sugar you get from a carrot, because of the fiber in it, to the sugar you get white bread or juices or the such.  Like I said at the beginning, Damon creates a great film, very informative, and full of great information.  It's a fun watch.  Enjoy it.  Learn from it.  And cut the sugars from your diet.",1527292800,,3951,4.671490593342981

7311027,4,B010H6NMKQ,"I thought it was very informative and I learned of some of the things that I need to eliminate from my diet, but I wish he explained more about what everday things have high sugar content.

7311028,5,B010H6NMKQ,"Sugar is getting plenty of attention lately, and for good reason. It is, according to many health experts, the principal villain in a global epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. ""That Sugar Film"" makes all this personal. Australian Damon Gameau decides to change his almost-no sugar diet to one more typical of a ""healthy"" American/Australian/Canadian. He doesn't eat a lot of sugary cereals, Pop Tarts, doughnuts and other stuff we know is loaded with sugar. Instead he drinks smoothies and fresh pressed juices, and eats low-fat granola bars, organic fruit yogurts and other foods that we think of as being good for us. The results are dramatic, and worth watching.",1526169600,,681,5.1441441441441444

7311034,5,B010H6NMKQ,Very well done! It's alarming how far out in left field our medical professionals' dietary recommendations have gotten. This film is an easy way to quickly understand the consequences of eating an excessively insulinogenic diet and how quickly the effects can be seen in someone whose body had been free from regular sugar consumption. I highly recommend anyone who cares about their health watch this.,1525132800,,402,5.2
7311035,5,B010H6NMKQ,"A man becomes his own lab rat in order to document his journey, by experimenting with eating 40 tsp of sugar a day for 60 days. He eats the same amount of calories as his prior healthy diet when he was lean and fit.... when he ate only healthy plant foods, meats and healthy fats, and within those 60 days of eating 40 tsp of sugar a day gained 15 pounds in weight. After 60 days has 7% more body fat. He also developed a pre diabetic condition, developed a fatty liver and would be heading towards heart disease and so many other medical maladies due to his bad food choices. His high sugar diet diet mimics most of the diets in America, even though he kept up with exercise.

To see a person's health carode within 60 short days was an eye opener. This was a young guy...It was exposed how food giants paid for their own
studies, filled with lies and deception in order to create profits and deceive the public into thinking a calorie is a calorie.....By adding more sugar to
beverages and products until it reached a point where the masses became addicted and obese... Also showing that rats preferred sugar to heroin...the sugar addiction throughout the world has become a world wide epidemic, thanks to the greedy food industries who make empty caloric
products. Foods and beverages with no redeeming qualities and zero nutrient value..

It's one of the most profound films I've ever seen on this subject...even though I've read books about the dangers of sugar, this brings it home to
a totally difference sense of reality. It's visual...It's watching a man start off healthy and slowly his body is fading...He's tired, he's starting to look
terrible...his skin, his eyes, his mind, his demeanor...He's lost his spark although he's young and vibrant and trying his best to overcome the power
of sugar...we can see how he too has joined the rank and file of those who choose foods with obvious sugar and those with hidden sugar over
healthy vegetables and good fats.. People have been disillusioned to believe fruit drinks are healthy, because why not, it's fruit...Jamba juice has
40 teaspoons of sugar per serving. Seeing a cup of it and watching someone drink it was enough to have made me remember this fact for the rest of my life...One thing I have to say about this film....It was a huge eye opener...Every packaged foods on the shelves of American supermarkets
have some form of hidden sugar. Only safe place to shop would be in produce aisles, dairy and meats/fish/poultry departments.

I found myself checking everything I was eating...finding out that my oatmeal (cooked from whole oats) is safe...low in sugar...as long as I don't
add any. A few berries and some yogurt and I'm safe...No juice, no packaged cereals, no sweetened yogurt, not even juicing my fruit...a glass
of juiced fruit, even in my own juicer would produce a drink with about 15 teaspoons of sugar...for a small glass...Not going to be something I'd
ever do again...never throwing out the fiber and believing I was doing something good for myself..

A life changer...This should be a required film for every parent, every child in school and every person everywhere to see and understand. We
have become a country of a disease model. We deserve to be educated and take back control of our lives...Big pharma controls us because the
food industries have been destroying our health. I don't feel this film was in any way biased...Damon Gameau allowed himself to prove to his
audience that his body nearly fell apart in 60 days eating like most Americans eat every single day.",1525046400,2,3559,4.7540453074433655

7311059,5,B010H6NMKQ,"Great documentary. It flies in the face of the laughable 'what the health' garbage hanging out on Netflix. It's currently turning the ignorant into vegetarians (nothing wrong with being vegetarian) which is the primary goal of it's creator, yet full of very bad journalism and one sided arguments with no evidence. Dude even goes into the deceptive territory. In short it claims meat is the bad guy, and get this....meat is causing diabetes (instead of the sugar, even praising sugar to some level).

 This documentary is nothing but results instead of fluff and only proves what everyone out there on a keto diet already knew.

I'm 45 and have eaten the standard American diet my entire life, minus candy and soda. Mostly because I don't like candy or soda.

This film has provided the information and motivation I've needed to cut out sugar (again).
Like most of us,  I know the facts about sugar consumption.  Seeing what it did to him though... the amount of weight he gained and inches on his waist,  and... spoiler alert: the inches and pounds he lost after going back to his non sugar diet was highly inspirational.

If I can't quit eating sugar after seeing this film,  I never will.

It's 2-10-18 and I weigh 142.   I would like to update in a month after cutting all sugar from my diet and hopefully see that I've lost 15 or so pounds.
Praying for strength.

7311070,3,B010H6NMKQ,"Overall, the movie had a good message. We don't need sugar is everything we eat. It's hiding almost everywhere. It's true.
That being said, it was hard to sit through at many points. I hate to be negative, but the narrator/star of the movie was really annoying. He loves to jiggle his stomach and there's some pleasant footage of him puking. Any part where the movie tries to be funny is just cringey and unnecessary.
The film's strengths lie in the interviews with actual people- Aboriginal Australians and a mountain dew-addicted 17 year old from Kentucky. These sections were interesting and show you parts of the world and perspectives you may not have seen before.
The weaknesses actually lie in the medical claims. Throughout the film, you can see Damon is feeling and looking worse. The visual evidence is very effective. The medical information about him is kind of lacking and hard to believe, though. They pretty much tell him he's dying based off minimal tests and how much weight he's gained. I'm sure the sugar has had a huge effect on that, but throughout the film he's traveling all over Australia and the United States and he's never clear about how much he exercises or how much water he drinks. I can't help but think that extensive traveling would have an effect on health... between having to eat out and not being on a normal schedule (sleep, exercise, or meal-wise).
Like I said, overall the message is good. If you can sit through the entire film, make sure you remain critical of all claims made (from both sides of the argument).",1515715200,,1554,4.716911764705882

7311086,1,B010H6NMKQ,"Refined sugar isn't that great for you, and you should watch you intake and maintain a healthy balanced diet. That's something I'm happy to tell you, but it would make a boring movie.

First of all, let's talk about style. This movie has it: Big name actors, lots of attitude, and a certain down-to-earth-but-not-really whimsy that a lot of people are going to find endearing. Which is why I'm not surprised that this movie has such a following. Perhaps it's because I went into this movie a little more skeptical than the average bear, or maybe it's because I've spent a lot of time researching psuedoscientific quacks and can see them a mile away, but I wasn't taken in.

First of all, google the people he talks to. Gameau mixes legitimate public health experts with nutty so-called ""health experts"" like David ""Avocado"" Wolfe, giving them a lot undeserved credibility. A lot of these people are selling something. That said, some of the things going on in this movie should have you scratching your head anyway. Like, why interview Thomas Campbell? He was trained as a physicist! I'm a chemist and I can tell you from personal experience that physicists make terrible chemists and biochemists. No offense to physicists, but it's just not what they do. Why should we listen to him on this issue? If you ask yourself questions like that, you'll quickly realize just how full of itself this movie is.

His explanation of the effects of fructose on the body is wrong. Just wrong. I watched it a few times to make sure that he said what I thought he said. ""The liver doesn't have a system to regulate the fructose because it was so rare in nature."" Yes it does. There are two systems, of which he only ""described"" one. One is the conversion of fructose to fat (yes, this is a form of regulation), which is not instantaneous and not simple. Fructose is actually converted into a series of intermediates that the body has to decide is does not need before it gets converted into Acetyl CoA or Glycerol-3-phosphate, which then become fatty acids and lipids for storage. If you're not consuming enough calories, your body will not do this, and the fructose gets converted into--wait for it... GLUCOSE! It's called gluconeogenisis and it's *basic* biochemistry.

Now, there is something to the idea that fructose will bypass a key regulatory step that is commonly seen in glycolysis, and helps drive fat deposition, but it doesn't change any of the net energetics. Does that mean you should eat all the fructose you want? No. It just means that the way the movie presents it is wrong. Fructose is not instantly converted to fat, and your daily intake is what makes your body decide on whether it is or isn't.

There are other problems. He uses a crummy ALT test for liver function. ALT tests are a poor diagnostic tool and will fluctuate naturally. His liver is not falling apart. I promise you that 12 weeks of adding sugar into your diet doesn't put you on death's door. It takes *years* to eat yourself into any kind of serious morbidity. Americans also don't eat nearly as much sugar as he claims. As with so many things in this movie, you're going to want to look that one up for yourself. Don't even get me started on the fact that science is not done by anecdotal evidence. A sample size of one has no value in science. Meanwhile, real research costs real money. This movie didn't pay for a bunch of scientists to recruit volunteers, measure hormone and metabolic levels, and figure out what was going on, one way or the other. It had a point to make, and did whatever possible to make it, and saved the money to pay for big name actors and animation.

By all means, don't eat refined sugar if you don't want to. It's an easy way to cut excess calories and most people in the industialized world need to cut calories. But don't believe anything because you saw it in a movie.",1511308800,13,3876,4.610144927536232

7311089,4,B010H6NMKQ,"It was good overall with a good (and I believe extremely accurate) message that refined/added sugar is more than just calories, it's addictive and dangerous for human health. That said, I'm also a firm believer in ""calorie in, calorie out"" dieting which relies on strict counting of calories.  Even watching him use a measuring cup for cereal made me cringe because measuring cups and spoons will never be as accurate as weighing food.  Long story short, I wish he was more convincing that his total calories and total activity were consistent (pre- and post- diet change).

I DO NOT think it would be healthy to do so and it would also be extremely difficult because sugar is very addictive and causes cravings.  However, you could live on sugar water and vitamin supplements and as long as you're not taking in more than you burn you will not gain weight.  It's physics.  What the body doesn't burn ends up as excess fat.  The body can't create fat when there are no extra calories floating around.",1510531200,,1000,4.712643678160919

Most of these concerns have been in the back of my mind for some time now, but to see if all clearly laid out about how destructive sugar really is, it made it much easier to say no to donuts that someone brought to class today. My girlfriend are going to start counting teaspoons(I always knew counting calories wasn't very effective) and see where we're at, and start shooting for the 10~ teaspoons/day limit.

I already knew most of the information presented in the film, having learned a lot about sugar and the food industry previously, and actually I myself have been sugar-free for the past 6 months (and feeling great). However, it was still interesting and educational to watch this film, especially to see the rapid and rather terrifying results of an only 60-day experiment with a high sugar diet (""high sugar"" being the amount that an average Australian consumes every day). This film is certainly not a complete picture, but no reasonably-lengthed film could be. It is, however, a great argument for cutting out or at least drastically reducing the sugar in our diets, and wake-up call to those who may not be aware of not only the prevalence of sugar in everyday ""healthy"" foods, but also the purposeful manipulation of our consumption by food giants and other bigwigs.

One day was a kid boxed lunch with like organic juice and things most people would think are excellent choices and showed just how much sugar servings add up and how quick it affects the body.

I am not opposed to natural sugar sources. I'm sorry but fruit is fantastic and has its place in life. This I think just helps you realize how much sugar servings can sneak up on you.",1499299200,,723,4.355555555555555

7311127,1,B010H6NMKQ,"Of course, you can't really derive much information from any experiment where n = 1, but this one is intrinsically very flawed. First, there is no ""blindness"" to the test, in fact, the patient is extremely biased towards a given outcome. Second, the two most important findings from the movie are damages done to his liver and his weight gain, which both don't really hold up to scrutiny.

The liver ""damage"" was primarily based upon a test that is infamously variable for the same patient from week to week, stating that he had sustained actual damage or had actually developed a disease is quite a stretch, and a deceptive one at that. Also, someone who has eaten such a rigorous diet for so long would be expected to notice a distinct effect from a COMPLETE swap in diet (on every level, from food types to macronutrient ratios). I mean, it seems like the man didn't even eat fruit prior to this.

Most importantly, and I believe what most people took away from this, was his weight gain from eating the ""same"" amount of calories (2300) on and off the sugar diet. The calorie counts used on foods are NOTORIOUSLY incorrect (not just inaccurate, but straight up wrong in many many cases). How calories were originally estimated was literally based upon the energy in the food (via burning it and measuring the temperature increase in surrounding water); this has no direct correlation on how many calories we can actually absorb from the food. This distinction is extremely relevant here, as nuts and seeds actually provide SIGNIFICANTLY fewer calories than the old estimates indicate (for example, we get about 68% of the calories estimated for almonds). Carbs with fiber (e.g. fruit), on the other hand, typically are absorbed at higher rates than the estimates indicate. Being that over half of his diet was fat with a large portion of that being nuts/seeds, it's quite possible that he was consuming 300+ actual calories with the new diet; this could very easily explain his weight gain. Men tend to put on fat in their stomach area whereas women distribute it more, that the fat was visceral is not surprising nor does it prove much.

Overall, I am pretty anti-sugar myself, but I'm going to call you out whether I like your results or not if your methods are disingenuous.",1498694400,9,2280,4.767088607594936

7311129,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This film is similar to ""Supersize Me,"" but with some key differences. Where ""Supersize Me"" consisted of the host gorging on fast food with large amounts of fat and sugar, Damon Gameau does the following:

1. Maintains the same calorie count as he did pre-experiment
2. Stays away from fast food, junk food and sodas, both before and during the experiment
3. Shifts his consumption to accomodate 40 teaspoons of sugar per day for 60 days, which we are told, is average for an Australian. For comparison, a single Jamba Juice fruit smoothie in the larger size in the United States contains 35 teaspoons of sugar.
4. Only chooses products marketed as healthy and nutritious, such as cereal breakfast bars and juices.

This film is enlightening if you do not know the effects of sugar on the body, a wonderful refresher for those of us that do, and an amazing motivator to move your life where it needs to go. Calories are not all created equal, as most of us intuitively know. This film makes the compelling case that sugar (and not fat, as we've been told) is the primary culprit in weight gain and metabolic disease. Most surprisingly, it is also the cause or aggravator of a host of mental health issues including depression, mood swings, fuzziness and difficulty concentrating.

Three years and 50 pounds later I am letting go of sugar again. I needed some extra motivation so I watched this movie. I am really glad I did. I know more than the average person does about nutrition, and also about how addiction works and the information presented aligns with my understanding. That is unusual

I also appreciated the information that was new to me, including info on the impact of artificial and ""natural"" low calorie sweeteners like Stevia have on the body. And I agree with the author on the fundamentally different ways that our bodies process foods regardless of the calories. But the film ended with the author a bit stuck on the ""a calorie is a calorie"" argument from the sugar industry. Calories are not the input. A calorie is  just a measure for a unit of heat energy locked in a bit of matter. The author confuses the measure for the thing itself.

For example, I can raise the temperature of water by transforming fuel into units of heat energy. A certain amount of oil, or of gas, burning wood, wind, water, or solar energy can be used as the fuel. The output, warmer water, is going to feel the same no matter what fuel is used. But in a closed system like the human body, how that fuel is transformed into calories makes all the difference. Some fuels are transformed more efficiently. They leave behind less residue and fewer negative byproducts, doing very little to no damage to the transformation environment. As the film points out, as a fuel, some types of sugar fuel are transformed into a calorie so inefficiently, they do a lot of damage to the transformation environment.",1497312000,3,1793,4.541795665634675

7311145,1,B010H6NMKQ,"""In the vein of ""Supersize Me""
I do not know if someone at Amazon has a sense of humor or if that was just picked Ironically or heck, even honestly?
Supersize Me was an attack/hit piece funded by a man who was planning a big lawsuit against McDonalds and Spurlock cheated his butt off to get the results that the guy funding the movie wanted. The documentary ""Fat Head"" covers a lot of the dirty tricks ""Supersize Me"" used to sell its lies.

So with food scareumentaries we know that meat, wheat, corn, HFCS, fish, anything not palio, etc will kill us horribly. Now it is sugar's turn.
Like Supersize Me you get a main character who will in a totally unbiased way (honest, we swear) test something he is actively against.
Like Supersize Me you get cheating.
Like Supersize Me you get spin and horrific dishonesty (the Aboriginal village explanation was horrific. The Appalachian tooth loss bit was just sad that they tried it.)
Like Supersize Me you get appeals to authority with people who are not experts in the field they will be speaking about. NASA Physicist explains how sugar works (and does it wrong).
Like Supersize Me you even get a barfing scene.
Unlike Supersize Me none of the producers seems to be planning to sue someone sugar related.
So it is a lot like they just used Supersize Me as a framework and switched the work ""fast food"" to ""sugar""

This is the story of a man who doesn't eat refined sugar but after seeing that people eat an average of 40 teaspoons (~4/5 cup, just under what you would put in a half gal of Koolaid) a day of sugar, is going to try eating 40 teaspoons a day of added and NATURALLY OCCURRING sugar a day for 60 days.
Problems right out of the gate.
1. He shows you his normal diet and is already eating ~ 40 teaspoons a day of naturally occurring sugar (his carbos). So right there is what happens if you eat 40 teaspoons a day of sugar.
2. He is eating the ""average"" person's amount of sugar per day. You can see ""average"" people all around you and they are not dying horribly like the film says will happen. We are talking average not those fit cyclists who will consume piles of sugar from energy gels and power bars ~45 min while cycling, so on a longer ride they will consume enough sugar to make the makers of this film cry.

After that we see lots of lies, dishonesty, and distortion. Unlike Spurlock this guy actually cheats on camera. When he measures his sugar he grabs silverware often it looks like a tablespoon and sometimes a teaspoon and serves himself heaping measures. Funny thing. While our silverware shares the same name as our measuring devices a heaping silverware teaspoon is roughly equal to 4 tsp and a heaping tablespoon is equal to roughly 4tblsp (AKA a quarter cup).. yeah, 40 tsp of sugar a day is different that 10 cups of sugar a day or even 160tsp a day.
When he is going off prepackaged food he at least has the numbers but he has already shown that he cheats so... This cheating allows him to pack on weight while ""Eating the same number of calories (honest!)""

There is a section that talks about how a village of aboriginals used to have to forage hard for food all day just to get by and then once they were given permanent ""all you can eat easily accessible food"" they got fat and had health problems. The film then points its finger squarely at sugar as the cause of the problems (not the ""all you can eat"" food).

Then it gets sadly laughable when they got to Appalachia (home of America's worst teeth) and blame Mountain Dew for one guy losing his teeth. Of course those in IT (information Technology) standardly see their coworkers drink quantities of Mountain Dew each day that would make the Appalachian Guy's skin grow pale, all while they maintain impeccable teeth. Lets face it the whole IT industry is fueled by Coffee or Mountain Dew, IT folks just brush their teeth.

This movie is a scareumentary so it will win awards I'm sure. It is in no way something accurate or that you should believe.  It is also aimed to appeal to the obese (it is not your fault, magical calories made you fat!). Exploiting people who are already struggling with their weight is a despicable crime against humanity which we see more and more of these days

I should note that I'm not a fan of sugar I prefer meat or something deep fried over something sweet any chance I get. That said America's obesity problem is still taking in more calories than people are burning. There are no magical ""make you fat"" calories. Sugar's real problem is that with it's calorie density it is VERY easy to take in more calories than you can burn and it is also very easy to incorrectly guess how many calories are in something, if you do not read the label (almost no one reads the nutrition facts).

Remember, your brain is the most glucose hungry organ in your body (movie doesn't come close to mentioning this) and if starving your brain is bad, then sugar can't be bad in responsible quantities.

Well at least I ""learned"" that adrenaline is not just fight or flight. it is actually Fight, flight, or eat sugar... I also ""learned"" that not getting sugar can cause panic attacks.. yeah, panic attacks.

7311167,4,B010H6NMKQ,"It's pretty funny that right after watching this film, I of course found a Slate article calling it a ""stupid movie"" with bad science given by a panel of ""charlatans and cranks."" Most of this stuff in the film we all kind of know already, so it's pretty absurd how the author of this Slate piece continues the exact same BS (proven fraud) that began with The Sugar Papers.

Never heard of The Sugar Papers?

Google ""The Sugar Papers."" That tells you everything you need to know that these sort of articles (like Slate's hit piece) are just more BS in a long line of BS. Just as it says in the film, the sugar industry's job was to make sure there is no consensus about sugar in order to stay profitable. If that isn't enough, check out the award-winning documentary The Century of the Self about the origins of Public Relations and the blatant war businesses fought with the US government to win the right to lie to the American people. It's fascinating and it shows this is also the origin of when people stopped trusting the government (spoiler: part of the PR tactic to fight the government trying to regulate their lies was actually lying to the American people about the government in all the papers and tv, making them look like the bad guy for going after private enterprises who were doing nothing wrong. Our government was not prepared for that and it actually worked so well that now our government itself is run by these big businesses. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Propaganda was officially legalized in USA with the NDAA in 2012, btw.)

At this point, anyone who believes industry-funded science which just happens to exonerate a suspect industry is a moron. There is a known peer-review problem in the scientific community and we have a decades-long history of proof that industry-funded scientists lied and our government experts lied (again: Google ""The Sugar Papers""). And if they didn't intentionally lie, we have also seen that they are often just plain wrong, but this is revealed to consumers after they've been following this bad advice for 20 or 30 years of their lives already.

The film is definitely worth watching, although it's padded with some fluff to make it feature length. If they took out a half hour of fluff and replaced it with more scientific facts and details, that would have been money better spent than all the fancy graphics in the movie. But, people watch movies like this to be entertained, so maybe I'm wrong. I deducted 1 star for some cutesy stuff that I didn't find entertaining, just a waste of time.

There are always going to be those Slate-reading types who tow party lines and beep their status quo funny clown noses as they spew more  uninformed BS like you find in the Slate article...but, for anyone who has just come back from the doctor and learned they have ""metabolic syndrome,"" take sugar off your diet and watch how fast that reverses. It is exactly what you see in the movie and it works every time. Hang out on AIP forums and you will see 100% success rate with people who dumped 30+ pounds of visceral fat and reversed course away from diabetes, fatty liver, etc. simply be cutting sugar out of their diet (that includes carbs that just immediately turn into sugar, which is not only the obvious like bread, pasta, and fries, but also supposedly ""healthy"" foods as shown in this film).

The guy in this movie ends up exactly where I was 4 months ago. Cutting sugar out of my diet, I lost 30 pounds in about 3 months and have simply kept it off, feeling great, no mood swings or trouble concentrating, just like it shows in the movie. I actually did the same thing about 10 years ago, but I slowly slipped back to my old ways because it's just too easy to eat unhealthy even when you're trying to be healthy. You basically have to prepare all your own meals and when you go out, you will quickly see that restaurants and prepackaged foods are heavy on carbs and sugar.

Anyone can prove this movie is true for themselves by simply experimenting with sugar. Keep an accurate food diary to prove to yourself just how serious your sugar cravings might be. It's a similar approach to what he does in the movie. Then, cut it out almost entirely: limit your sugar intake to 2 small pieces of fruit a day (but no bananas, they are high in sugar). Avoid carbs which simply turn into sugar like all breads, pastas and potatoes. Instead of all those ""bad"" carbs, you can eat yams (sweet potatoes), jicama and green plantains. Don't eat sweet potato french fries, though, because they're fried in the wrong kind of fat. Eat healthy fats instead: olive oil, coconut oil, and avocados. Cube a sweet potato (yam) and bake it in a pan with a little olive oil at 350 degrees for a half hour. Add salt for a ""sweet potato french fry"" sort of taste; add salt and cinnamon for a delicious desert sort of taste. Green plantains can be sliced and baked the same way in coconut oil for ""plantain chips"". Just add salt and they're delicious! Besides this, just eat meat and plenty of salads and steamed vegetables with nothing but olive oil, white vinegar and some salt. Dressings have a lot of sugar in them, so avoid them.

Not only did a standard american diet make me 30 pounds overweight in exactly the same way as this movie shows, it also caused incredible full-body inflammation which led to muscle and joint pain, headaches, brain fog and several other debilitating conditions. I never thought of ""chronic inflammation"" as a serious term until I learned chronic inflammation is behind every major life-threatening illness like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc.",1494633600,12,5619,4.622244488977956

I eat great, I feel satisfied, I even smell better. I dreaded going off my steady diet of sugar and bad food. I loved that stuff. But I had to do better.

7311180,5,B010H6NMKQ,"I thank God for leading me to this film. For about the last month or so, I've been trying to lose weight. I started off well, losing about 10 lbs the first few weeks. However, I hit a plateau in my weight loss. To remedy this, I started counting calories. I went from approx. 2500-3000+ calories per day to 1500-1700 calories per day. Although I was consuming less calories, I kept gaining weight. The calorie counting app I use would often report that I exceeded my daily recommended sugar intake. Not worried about counting sugar, I ignored the sugar reports. After about 2 weeks of eating less, but gaining 1 to 2 lbs per week, the thought came into my mind that perhaps sugar is the culprit...that's when I stumbled upon this film. My eyes were opened and I immediately spread the word to loved ones about the film. Speaking of the film, it is well researched and entertaining. I appreciated the fact that it spoke on ""diet"" foods, not just the foods that most people know are high in sugar. I was very impressed with this film.",1491004800,,1032,4.49468085106383

Then I went on a business trip and starting eating more sugar and process foods and gained several pounds and did not feel as good. This video just jumped started me on cutting the sugar out! I think when I get bad cravings, I can just watch it again. I'm not a pop drinker but like the chocolates. It makes me rethink foods we give to kids. This should be a have to watch video for new parents. I try to shop the perimeter of the grocery store like Damon mentions.  Two months of eating ""healthy processed foods"" affected Damon's health in a bad way.

7311208,5,B010H6NMKQ,"I was very impressed at the fun and playful way this documentary was done. Not only was it informative but it was visually fun to watch and had a positive buoyancy to it.  In my mid 20s-early 30s when I was single I was completely off sugar (all forms) for 8 years, I felt the most healthy, effortlessly present and relaxed during those years, though it took the first few to get there via detox. I had many of the experiences that Damon presents in the detox process at the end of the movie, and know the difference between a mind and body on sugar and one off sugar that he shows the viewer. You can't know the difference until you experience being sugar free for a good chunk of time--I would venture from 6 months to a year or 2, depending on how much detoxing your body needs to do.

I will also say if you plan to do it, be prepared for what they say in the film, not only physical detox symptoms but psychological and emotional ones, like temporary depression or anxiety. But know they will pass. I highly recommend meditation to help you learn not to identify with the detox symptoms that come up,  and just let them pass through like clouds.  This is particularly helpful with the mental and emotional detox (I used Vipassana meditation).

Another thing, in our progress oriented culture, sugar is a go to to keep going, so you may have to try to let yourself be okay with resting, and doing nothing, sleeping more, at random times as you body detoxes.  Without sugar to jack you up whenever you're feeling down, you are also likely to experience your body's natural cyclical need for rest over the course of your sugar free life, and hopefully you won't feel guilty for it, but rather honor it. If you use coffee or other stimulants, that's another matter--one worth examining.

That leads me to one other topic: for some people, sugar detox leads to sugar ""replacement"". Which can be anything from eating more of other things, spending more time online, buying things, anything to distract from the emotions, thoughts and symptoms that the detox process may incur. I recommend consciously choosing some empowering item or action, prior to even starting to detox, such as going for a walk, sitting in a chair and breathing slowly and deeply  for 1 min, or doing a squat to get some good endorphines pumping. Whatever works, but plan ahead for that time you hit a point of rebounding back to sugar or filling sugar's place with another unhealthy item or action, and have that healthy item or action ready to fill the gap.

There are forums out there online and on facebook: Sugar Anonymous etc.  if you need support and don't have it nearby.  Now (45) I still eat organic/local, no processed foods and have a low sugar intake, but feel how sugar, even ""healthy"" varieties, don't help me out when I eat them.
""That Sugar Film"" has re-inspired me to explore being completely sugar free again.  Good luck to those who try it,  you'll likely have a more calm, emotionally even, mentally present and physically healthy human experience to look forward to. ;)",1486512000,11,3062,4.5963302752293576

Personally, I don't have much of sweet tooth (or at least a didn't think so). But I never knew I was getting sugar in gravy or pasta sauce! My daughter, on the other hand, has really struggled. She gave up sugar almost entirely a few years ago, but in the past few weeks, under a lot of college stress and a limited food budget, has gotten off her normal food plan. Now I know why her moods are off the chart and her energy so wildly fluctuating. I will definitely recommend this for her!",1485820800,,1004,4.87719298245614

I really enjoyed it, and it's the type of film that every single person should see. The sugar epidemic should be understood by everyone. We all need to eat to live. We don't want to eat to die. And sugar damages our body in ways that corporations have worked hard to conceal from the public. I believe the sugar Industry is just as bad as the pharmaceutical industry. It's easier for them to hide it though.

The scenes of the young Kentucky man getting his teeth pulled was enough to make anyone swear off Mt Dew.  It's not the calories, its what sugar does to your body.

It's fascinating and horrifying to see how much our eating habits are influenced by politics that go to the highest levels of business, government, and relentless marketing.  I'm frankly shocked that scientists were bought out to blame fat instead of the more relevant target of sugar in our processed foods for our increasing Western diet related health problems of diabetes, heart disease, inattentiveness, and mood crashes (among many others).",1484870400,,709,5.086206896551724

And to the comments saying it's just water weight -- I feel like you maybe missed all the other symptoms he had. His hormones were off and he was at the start of fatty liver. He had acne and his mood was messed up.

This film is great because it has made me mindful of the hidden dangers in what is marketed as otherwise healthy and low fat foods. There is also a great antidote when Damon(host) does a ""Super Size Me"" inspired 30 day diet eating 40 Tbs of sugar a day and paying the consequences.

His health is tracked much like the film Supersize Me and he, predictably, sees a decline in his health. While it's very shocking to see how quickly he reaches his daily intake of 40 teaspoons of sugar while eating no ""sweets,"" candy, soda, etc., and it's shocking to realize the amount of sugar in foods that so many people eat daily, I find it hard to believe that sugar is the sole substance responsible for his health's demise. Time and money was spent on graphics and videography rather than substantiating the main suspect in this movie; sugar. It's my opinion that sugar (in all of its forms) is over-utilized in foods today, but I'm not convinced that sugar is the main culprit here.",1484179200,,777,4.678832116788321

7311390,3,B010H6NMKQ,"Slick and glossy with high production value, it's a lot like the sugar it maligns: fun to consume, but with little real value.
First, I'll agree with the basic premise that the massive uptake in processed sugars is a health crisis. I'm not arguing against that. The problem for me is the way the film bends the truth at various times, solely for dramatic effect.
The ""science"" presented is often suspect: Mr. Gameau presents himself as above average in health prior to the beginning of his food experiment, then proceeds to gain 20+lbs over the course of the month while eating, what he claims, was an equal number of calories in sugar as he did before in 'normal' food. The problem is he was on a low-carb ketosis style diet that artificially lowered his body's water weight due to lack of glycogen stores. Of course he's going to bloat up; he'd do that if he ate more carbs, high fructose or not.
However, even 20lbs of water weight gain would be extreme, so we're left to take the film-maker's word that his calorie intake was ""roughly the same"" before as after. Over the course of a month, even a simple 200 calorie increase from 2300 to 2500 would lead to a size difference of a couple pounds. Unfortunately, he goes from meticulously charting his intake during the first day or two to not showing any food measurements whatsoever after, especially as he expands in his travels, leaving home for weeks at a time. If he's going to make a movie with big claims, the least he could do is disclose the exact figures. Instead, he glosses over it all by saying his calorie intake was more or less the same, which presents a load of problems, because we all know it was more, not less.
There have been a number of experiments showing that, for weight gain, calories in vs calories out is the biggest determinate in gain vs loss. Take the famous example of a professor who ate nothing but twinkies and other refined junk for two months and lost 27 pounds (I tried posting a link but Amazon rejected it. Google ""professor twinkie diet"" and it'll pop up on CNN and other sites from 2010).
Damon Gameau is doing a public service in exposing the issues of sugar consumption, but he's misleading people by manipulating little facts here and there in service of that. If you want to be entertained and confirm a belief you already hold, watch this movie. I wouldn't christen it as revalatory or even particularly good, though. It's full of weak, unnecessary fluff (mt dew teeth, the inexplicable music video at the end).
In the end, a lot of my issues with this come not only from the film, but the people who proselytize its virtues. The same types who decried the saturated fat crisis in the 60s-90s as shown in the film are the same people who today bemoan the state of our sugar consumption, mostly because they are told to do so by someone else with a limited understanding of the science behind it all. How do I know this? Because nutrition science is understood, as a whole, by nearly no one. It's currently in its infancy and no one really knows what is 'healthy' and what is not. Frankly, any claims otherwise are pure guesswork. It comes from a good place, but in a decade or two some new fad will emerge and the those claims will be lifted up as gospel. In the end, do the best you can by eating a balanced diet with a variety of nutrients from a number of sources while keeping your caloric intake directly in line with your body's daily needs. Eliminating sugar or fat or anything else entirely from your diet is a road to a whole host of other potential health issues as more research emerges.

Summary: fun, entertaining movie, but don't get caught up in believing the 'science' presented. The 'facts' are suspect, but in service of a good cause",1483920000,2,3751,4.524300441826215

7311446,5,B010H6NMKQ,"Everyone should watch this documentary about the effects that sugar has on your body.  Mr. Gameau was able to put together the story of sugar in a way that is interesting and horrifying at the same time.  As someone who was recently diagnosed as diabetic, I wish I had seen this a long time ago. Perhaps I would have made different choices and avoided this disease altogether.",1482710400,,376,4.597014925373134
7311447,4,B010H6NMKQ,"Entertaining film about how eating too much sugar leads to weight gain.  The ending is a bit corny.  The film picks on sugar, and the guy says he eats the same amount of calories as before, but I cannot believe that he gained 20 lbs eating mostly sugary foods and yet his daily calorie count stayed the same as before the sugar experiment.  So that claim is a bit suspicious to me.  I suspect he ate more calories.  That does not mean you should eat lots of sugar laced products at the expense of healthier choices.  The film does do a good job of showing how the big food companies and advertising and our culture essentially doom all of us to gaining weight as we grow older.  The movie shows how much the food industry, government, and culture stack up against us.",1482710400,,767,4.359154929577465

7311465,5,B010H6NMKQ,"If you need motivation to clean up your diet and especially to remove as much sugar as possible from it, here it is. For 60 days, Damon Gameau consumed 40 teaspoons of sugar a day, not drinking soft drinks or eating candy or cake, but eating ordinary cereals with low-fat yogurt, drinking all-natural fruit juice, and otherwise eating what most people would consider a ""healthy"" diet. You won't believe how many changes occurred in his body in just 60 days. He went from a very healthy man to one on the verge of liver disease, diabetes, and ultimately heart disease. There are so many hidden sugars in processed food, we all eat far more sugar than we realize. If we add sugar-laden foods like soft drinks and sweets on top of that, it is a recipe for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Watch this PLEASE and encourage all your friends and relatives to watch it, too. The sugar industry is seducing us into overconsuming excessively sugary foods and for those who avoid that, there is the hidden sugar in ""healthy"" foods. The bottom line?

7311509,5,B010H6NMKQ,"17 years ago, my husband and I took our son off of sugar and white bread when he was going through depression and weight gain at 10 years old. After about 8 weeks he dropped 25 pounds and was like a totally different kid. He was happier and even went through a growth spurt. At first I thought his getting taller was just a change he would have gone through anyway, but now I think it could have been because his body chemistry had improved.

As a nurse, it amazes me how much false information is even in the medical field. One of the nutritionist's advice to a diabetic patient was that he needed to eat more snacks. She didn't even tell him what those snacks should be, so it wasn't long after her visit that he was requesting ice cream. Even the diabetic meal trays have white bread and juice on them. Of course, part of the reason is because patients will complain if this stuff isn't provided to them. Sugar is so addictive, though, so I can see why we get those complaints. I really liked how the information was presented and I found the aborigine part of the film especially interesting.",1480550400,,1096,4.372549019607843

7311511,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This movie is life changing IF you are willing to listen.  We are sugar free now thanks to this video.  More importantly we have made huge improvements in our health. I am talking not just about losing weight without trying I am talking about correcting potentially deadly medical conditions and going off of medications.  There are warnings you need to know about if you are going to go off of sugar.  First get a blood pressure meter if you are on medications for high blood pressure.  My better half went off sugar and sugary natural foods (sweet fruits, juices, potatoes, breads and starches) with the result that his blood pressure medications were making him ill.  We called the GP who insisted it was an allergy to one of the BP medications because ""you do not suddenly stop needing blood pressure medications due to dietary changes""  She was wrong.  If you stop eating sugar you start eating other things and your blood pressure can normalize very quickly.  Expect radical personality changes - improved sex drive, better mood (once you adjust) and feeling much healthier and more energized.  In addition to our behavior that of our 6 year old daughter's behavior changed radically.  Yes, you can mitigate many of the symptoms of Asperger's by removing sugar!  Expect to need new clothes.  There is that wonderful feeling that comes with losing weight without having to work for it.  You will find that vegetables are sweet and that things considered too tart to eat without sugar now have a sweet taste.  As an example with time I found myself getting the same taste reaction to lemon water that I used to get from lemonade.  On the down side you will never enjoy the taste of sweets again.  Ick.

How can I add more, it says it all in the first two sentences.

I've rad a bunch of negatives about this movie.  Apparently people don't get it....having eaten sugar from baby-stage on.  I for one do not consider it normal to have 34 teaspoons of sugar in a Jamba Juice smoothie.  This is disgusting.  Everywhere you look, there is sugar.  Go to Whole Foods and look for unsweetened dried cranberries.  You won't find them.  What you will find is ""apple-juice sweetened cranberries"" or ""organic-sugar"" sweetened cranberries.  We used to be able to buy regular cereal at Whole Foods but now everything has sugar.  Still don't think this is by design?  Get people hooked, get people fat.  They will always eat sugar.  It's disgusting.  Sugar should be classified as a drug.  That is what it is.  But the FDA carries the water for big business including the sugar industry.

Also why is he working in tsp of sugar? I mean who sits around going gee I wounder how many tsp of sugar are in these Twinkies lets calculated it for fun or and that donut looks good but lets convert it to tsp of sugar with no regard of all the rest of the crap that is in it. Why not include total grams of carbs? Or % carb?  or refined oils or added chemicals or trans fats or nitrates or grain fed domestic animals or something that could be useful instead of just talking about sugar.  Also I feel it is unusual that he gained all the weight he claimed on 40 tsp of sugar within only 2300 calories which is all the food detail mentioned in this movie completely disregarding all the other macros and components of food.  As his age I can only suspect that he has an activity level of barely moving.  I saw where he had some goofy home gym but doubt that he is really using it.  If he could have ran a certain distance or rode a bike a number of miles or lifted some amount of weight for some amount of times in some described manner with some frequency it would have been more useful and I'm sure Hugh Jackman could have helped him with that. He must of had a s***load of money to get all these highly famous people to go along with his goofy reiteration of all the same information. If you go to YouTube and search for Low Carb High Fat or LCHF or Keto diet or Vegan or Blue Zones or just about anything related to a healthy diet then you could get way more detailed information from way more credible people without all this fluff.  Wished I hadn't wasted my time but for some people that need the information presented in this way, well maybe it will be of some use? I did like the graphics in the liver with the same old description of fructose glucose and insulin.

7311671,4,B010H6NMKQ,"Filmmaker Damon Gameau has been living in the years preceding the documentary with a healthy diet: 50% of his calories came from fats, 25% from proteins, 25% from complex carbs. He was in a good health. For his documentary, he pursues an interesting premise: he will switch to a ""standard"" diet of 40 teaspoons of sugar a day, but to start only get this sugar from ""healthy"" sources such as museli, fruit juice, granola bars, low-fat yogurt, etc.

The changes are rapid and drastic. He puts on weight at a rate of about 2 lbs a week and it seems to mostly be in the stomach. They talk blood tests, and the change they notice is he starts to rapidly develop fatty liver disease. His personality also changes, which his girlfriend comments on, he has much stronger ups and downs now. To reiterate, this is entirely from foods you might find in kids' lunch boxes such as granola bars and low-fat yogurt, and he hasn't increased his calories. He's eating the same number of calories (~2,300/day) as he was when eating a healthy diet. This is altogether different from Morgan Spurlock eating 5,000+ calories a day at McDonalds. We're seeing extremely rapid changes (fatty liver disease in a few weeks), at fixed calories, and these are coming from supposedly healthy foods, not brownie fudge ice cream.

There's then a few more interesting things that happen. Gameau visits an aboriginal town in western australia, and we learn western australia has some of the world's highest coca cola consumption. The rest of the world is told that the problems with aboriginal australians are due to alcohol for decades, but this town's elders have said no alcohol, yet there are still health problems. The town's elders then said ""no sugar"" as well to help out, but the government cut funding from their organiation shortly after and the sugar came back very quickly. It's tragic. We see a ton of obesity in the town.

Gameau then visits America. It is virtually impossible to stay under 40 teaspoons of sugar a day. He goes to a town in Kentucky, a state where Pepsi Cola dominates. He meets a man who has been drinking 6+ cans of mountain dew a day since he was a kid. The man is ~18 and he has the worst teeth I've ever seen. His cousin is 3 years old, and apparently he's getting mountain dew n a baby bottle from his mother. They try to give him dental surgery, but the dentist has to cut it short, as his gums are too damaged to handle the painkillers. It's just atrocious. I had to look away from the screen when his teeth were shown, these are by a large margin the worst teeth I've seen.

A comment made is that it is impressive how adaptive the human body and human society is. We know how bad sugar is for you and ... we're adapted. Society is adapted. The case is convincingly that perhaps our ADHD culture relates to sugar, and everything else about it. There's some closing side discussion about the psychological effects on individuals and people abandoning sugar to discover serenity. I think this is a valid point and I don't recall having arrived there myself.

I don't know why the rotten tomatoes rating is a dismal 64%. My first request from documentaries, other than good production value, is that I actually learn something. I do so here, and for me that's certainly enough for the movie to get a ""pass"". It may be that documentary critics have higher standards than say the people reviewing comic book movies. Alternatively, maybe they were unhappy the movie didn't blame bacon for the obesity epidemic. Toward the end of the movie, Gameau is trying to get back in health (eventually succeeds) and his breakfast has no jam, no bread, no pancakes, no pop tarts, no waffles but it does have bacon, eggs, avocado. This may have offended critics.

IF the basis of modern western medicine is that each of our bodies is really close to somebody else's, and thats the basis of all antibiotics, pain relievers, etc. Then why when it comes to diet(or rather what we generally eat) suddenly the science is different?  As you let that digest, here is my review.

Very good film. It makes the point that sugar in our daily diets can have a negative effect on our health.  I for one watch my intake of fructose very closely anyway because I just plain feel better overall when I do not consume sugar in its myriad of forms. Watch the film, then decide for yourself if it makes sense.

He was eating a Ketogenic or nearly Ketogenic diet prior to going on the sugar binge.  Therefore he was carrying very little glycogen.  For every 1 gram of glycogen stored the body stores 3-4 grams of water with it.  The bulk of his initial weight gain was in fact water.  That's also why he lost the weight so fast when he returned to his original diet.  Second thing is the way that he consumed his sugar calories helped him get extra fat.  He was eating sugar by itself, sometimes his entire daily allotment as a standalone meal with nothing else with it.  That is going to wreak havoc with insulin and cause the sugar to be stored as fat.  Of course he knew these things and used them to his advantage to make a point.  Hopefully it sparks an interest and further reading so the real learning can begin.",1471132800,7,1083,4.355

7311796,4,B010H6NMKQ,That Sugar Film was very enlightening and informative. While I knew we have a lot of sugar in our diets I had no idea of the amount of sugar. It is incredible to think that we can consume so much sugar on breakfast alone. Once you add in the soft drinks and other sugary items typically consumed it is mind blowing. It is no wonder why obesity is so prevalent in our society today when even food that is labeled healthy is just as bad.,1468800000,,435,4.129411764705883

Gameau is not just another guy with a go pro and iMovie, it is evident he is a film maker through his overall story telling. As someone who has also studied nutrition, I appreciate the film's stand point on sugar is not completely black or white. At the end of the film I didn't feel guilty about my sugar habits. I think the most shocking thing for me as an audience member, and someone who enjoys sugar was the quickness in which his physiological tests changed.

7311824,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This was very informative! The use of graphics and humor as well as data made it easy to understand the side effects a high sugar lifestyle can have. If you are looking to make a change I encourage you to keep watching documentaries and read some books. I would recommend the documentary forks over knives and cowspiracy to start. Then you can look into a book by Douglas J. Lisle that talks about food and psychology to reset  your brain. Then dig into some books by Rip Esselstyn,  Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn. Include your family and friends  in your new lifestyle. Tell them that you need their help to succeed. Starts following people on instagram or facebook who post recipes of different foods you can try. Sadly the average household only eats or rotates 5-7 types of foods or meals. Just imagine all the foods you have yet to try! Challenge yourself to learn something everyday that will benefit your or someone else. I promise that if you do this not only will you be healthier but you may just save someones life simply by your example. We all know someone that has weight to lose or is sick. You hold the power in your hands right now to be an inspiration to someone. Make it a point to get educated on what you eat and what it does to your body. When I made the change to live longer I was so embarrassed on how truly uneducated I was in this area. Its rare that people talk about health tips so make it a point to learn it on your own and do your research. This film was a great inspiration and kicked off new habits.  Thanks for reading this review I kind of went off topic but I hope that I shed some light on a very important topic not to be taken lightly or forgotten.",1468454400,,1704,4.299065420560748

7311885,4,B010H6NMKQ,"This documentary is informative, entertaining and enjoyable.  While I don't agree with everything that's stated (for instance I believe there are a lot of health benefits in juicing), it's a great film.  They touch on some subjects and show some footage (briefly) that are NOT kid-friendly.  So I'd personally recommend parents watch the film before letting little one's see it.  It will certainly make you think twice about what your eating though, and may help you remember to read labels.  Some great cameos in this film too... including Hugh Jackman.  The less-then-kid-friendly scenes are the only reason I didn't give this film 5stars.",1466121600,,641,5.174757281553398
7311886,4,B010H6NMKQ,Interesting documentary. Definitely makes you think about how much sugar we are ingesting. I would have liked to hear more about what he was eating before he started eating all this sugar. Also I think his sugar diet he is trying is a bit exaggerated. I think most people include a vegetable at least one or twice a day. Possibly a salad sometimes. It was shocking to see how soon he started to develop a fatty liver. Good info overall though.,1466121600,,443,4.481481481481482

This film will teach you what your liver is really doing when confronted by excess sugar, how your insulin reacts to sugar, and most importantly, how sugar is creating fat in your body and KEEPING IT THERE! This film doesn't focus on ice cream, soda, and candy (even though this are the extreme of sugar intake), but rather on the 'every day' foods we think are good for us, but have large amounts of sugar added by the food corporations and hidden in such a way as to make their foods appear healthy.

If a food is good without a lot of sugar, then the brand with a little bit extra will be preferred, it is just the way we are wired. I have been so naive!
Since watching the film I have recommended it to anyone who will listen. So well done! The only part I could not watch was the poor sixteen year-old's dental work, the result of year after year of Mountain Dew consumption. Will never drink soda again! In fact, I now shop only in the fruit and veg section of the supermarket because the packages and cans and jars in the middle have mostly been de-nutritized.

.  He ate almost all processed foods which contain many bad elements including chemicals, and everything was not as low fat as they claimed.

7311935,5,B010H6NMKQ,"I am a 72 year old morbidly obese male. During my life I have tried many diets. I have tried Atkins, South Beach, Mediteranian, Weight Watchers, and others. None provided me with a long term solution to my excess weight problem. Two years ago, I began to do research, hoping to find the cause of my failure to reduce and control my weight. About one year ago, I found that the cause is carbohydrates. All carbohydrates are like poison to my body. Refined sources like corn syrup and fructose are the most toxic. I now follow the Ketogenic Diet nutrition plan. I consume no more than 25 grams of carbohydrate each day. I continue to drop 1-2 pounds each week, my blood markers continue to improve, and I feel better and think better as each day passes.

That Sugar Film conveys a very strong and truthful message. I applaude Damon Gameau for putting out a very honest and entertaining documentary. During the making of the piece, Damon not only talked the talk, he walked the walk. He literally put his life in danger to get his point across.

7312105,5,B010H6NMKQ,"A very high-quality film that covers a lot of good evidence of the sugar problem we face today. I am only 18 years old and I am almost pre-diabetic. My problem is that doctors have really done nothing to help me reduce my sugar intake or develop a diet for me even though I have all the symptoms of insulin resistance. I think that doctors not diagnosing things correctly or helping patients develop a diet is another major factor in how unhealthy we are as a population. You go to the doctor and they just tell you to lose wight but they don't actually give you the tools you need to eat healthier so I'm lost out in the open essentially with choosing foods. This film actually made me emotional at some parts because I feel as though there is so much wrong with my health but doctors have not helped me, really.

Anyway, this film is very educational and factual and everyone should have to watch this just to see how sugar negatively effects the body. I like the history bits and the shocking bits and it was an overall interesting and eye-opening film that was not at all boring.",1463097600,,1083,4.388059701492537

7312157,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This documentary is much like Super Size Me, but focuses on processed sugar intake specifically.  A healthy fit man changes his ""no processed sugar"" diet for 60 days and documents the effects along the way.  At the end of the 60 days he has gained 15 lbs and 10cm around the waist, his liver blood tests show the beginning of fatty liver disease and his cholesterol is at dangerous levels.

I like that he keeps the variables at bay by maintaining the same caloric intake, swapping his healthy fat calories for processed sugar calories.  He also continues on the same exercise regimen.  Additionally, he doesn't just start eating  a bunch of junk food filled with preservatives.  He chooses foods that are otherwise perceived as healthy options, such as frozen yogurt, granola bars and vitamin drinks, just to name a few.

The progress and results are given in metric measurements, which I admit Im not used to.  My bad for being one of those Americans that hasn't jumped on board with the rest of the world, lol.

In all, I found it helpful enough that I watched it a second time along with my husband (so he would understand the changes in lunch I pack).  While we won't be jumping on board with the way this guy usually eats (Paleo?  IDK), we will be drastically cutting down on the sugar intake.",1462406400,,1299,4.6

7312180,5,B010H6NMKQ,excellent film.  Not only entertaining but very informative.  Funny how it always takes someone from overseas to put things in the right perspective about this sort of epidemic going on here in the US.  Highly recommended.  Get off sugar while you still can.

While it's clear what the author is attempting to convey, it is not done in a condescending way, nor is it done in a cryptic manner. This is, perhaps, the most informative documentary I have watched in decades. If you're not a Prime member, spend the $0.99 and sit down for two hours to follow one man's journey to find out what real health is. Hint: it's not what you have been told.",1461801600,,467,4.441860465116279
7312188,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This was an eye-opening experience for me. The Film is very nicely presented documentary which shows how sugar can affect your body and how various manufactures do deceptive marketing in concealing various forms of sugar into your food items you love. The most disturbing truth is how most commonly purchased fat free products are having the most sugar content and how that ultimately affects your overall health. This movie also shows how the various soda companies create the perfect formula to get you hooked onto sugar.

This is a must see movie if you want to have a healthy life and learn the real truth behind sugar and how to avoid them for having a healthy life.

I would have liked to see him compare the number of steps he took each day to see if he was averaging the same.  Overall it was a great documentary with a lot of good, unbiased opinions.  This show wasn't laden with prejudices and opinions driven by the ""science"".  It tried to show simple fact driven results from dietary changes.  The show makes a lot of good points.  Look at most anything that is low-fat and it is full of sugar.  Compare low-fat yogurt to regular and you will see that the low-fat variety has much more sugar.  The same goes for salad dressings.  Simply put, your body won't burn fat if it has too many simple sugars to use.  Your body also won't store as much fat if it doesn't have excess sugars/carbs.",1461542400,,840,4.361290322580645

7312276,5,B010H6NMKQ,"The movie will be eye opening to the public and it presents it in a fun and engaging way culminating with a goofy music video at the end. David subjected himself to a two-month high sugar diet and this impacted his metabolism negatively, in spite of what food companies and some medical ""experts"" are saying that sugar is not the culprit.

I agree with almost everything in the movie: sugar is everywhere in modern food, it is addictive like cocaine or morphine, it causes most metabolic problems, and it is hard to stop eating it. The only point I disagree with is that the villain was pointed to be fructose. It is not ""rare"" because it is in almost any fruit and the body probably does have a way to deal with it, as long as fructose is consumed in the original fruit. I don't know a person that got metabolic problems from eating a lot of apples for example. The actual problem is the isolation of sugar/fructose from its natural sources and consuming it in a concentrated form.

If you want to preserve your metabolism, simply do not eat concentrates: sugar, milk, and reduce bread consumption (substitute with rice). You will have the strongest urges for those in the evening but substitute with a bowl of rice with some meat or salad. You will see in 2-3 weeks that you don't need sugar actually and that rice keeps you full much longer with reduced calories simply because it is not a concentrate.",1460937600,2,1405,4.549407114624506

7312283,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This is one of the most important and informative films you'll ever watch.  It just makes so much sense.  For years we've been wondering how our society (American) has turned into giant massive people lumbering around everywhere.  When I was a kid in the early 60's it wasn't like this.  So what happened?  This film explains exactly what happened and how once again it's our wonderful big corporations and their influence over the government to make piles of money.  No surprise.

The best part of this is I've always been slightly overweight and could never figure out how to lose it.  I would always run into a wall.  By just removing all the hidden sugar from my diet I've already lost 15 pounds in a short period of time and I feel great.  It's tough at first when that sugar addiction keeps whispering in your ear but it gets easier as you go.  Best of all I feel this weight will not be returning like it does with most of the fad diets out there.

7312346,3,B010H6NMKQ,"YES MINIMIZING SUGAR IS A GOOD IDEA. DUH. I agree with most of the ONE STAR reviews.

The ""addictive"" problems with sugar DOES merit more attention. As does its teeth-rotting property. Is sugar a dentist's best friend? $ $  The role of excessive highly refined sugar intake in promoting  several lifestyle related chronic diseases continues to need attention. DUH.

SO FAR, SO GOOD.  What's not to like then?  It's very unfortunate that the journalist Gary Taubes is presented as an expert. Over the years, obese Gary Taubes continues to FALSELY claim that America, in recent decades, has been on a ""low-fat"" regimen. This contradicts reality. Visit any supermarket. Nearly endless high-fat products (with over 30% calories from fat) continue to dominate shelf space. Honest low-fat products (with under 10% or so calories from fat) are NOT crowding out high-fat products. DUH. Any talk of a ""ultra low-fat era"" is a recycled  MYTH. Here's what Dean Ornish says about journalist Gary Taubes: ""He'll say things like, ""Well, Americans have been told to eat less fat. The percentage of calories from fat is down, and yet Americans are fatter than ever. Therefore fat doesn't make you fat."" Now, he knows better, because I've actually debated him as well. And it's a half-truth. The percentage of calories from fat is down, but actually Americans are eating MORE fat than ever. The only reason that the percentage is lower is that they're eating more fat and even more simple carbs. So the goal is not to say, fat is good, carbs or bad, but to say there are good fats and bad fats, there are good carbs and bad carbs, there's good protein and bad protein, and so an optimal diet would be low in the bad carbs but high in good carbs."" Several Ornish videos are only keystrokes away on line.. All good booksellers and public libraries have his media. GREAT feature: Today's orders arrive tomorrow with Amazon Prime subscription.

7312353,5,B010H6NMKQ,"The first most important thing that you will get from this documentary is that sugar is added to 80% of all supermarket products (mostly processed food). The second most important thing is that sugar is as addictive as cocaine. Sugar is essentially the cheapest drug out there. You'll see the experiment where the mouse goes for the sugar before going for cocaine. Yes, it's that addictive.

Most of us are addicted to sugar. We don't have to be eating huge amounts of sugar in order to know that we are addicted. It could be the candy bar we eat every other day. I have been trying to get off of sugar for years now, but I'm still addicted, even though I eat refined sugar only a few times a week (in small amounts).

I would say that this documentary is a bit better than 'Fed Up'. People aren't aware that fruit smoothies that are bought from the supermarket don't contain the entire fruit in it. That's why their sugar is not good for you. If you blend an orange, banana and a pineapple in a blender, that's perfect. But when you drink apple juice, you are getting the sugar without the meaty fiber part!

I cringed at some moments when I saw him eating raw sugar and when I saw the American 17-year old lose his teeth because he drank more than 10 Mountain Dew's a day. I seriously damaged my teeth when I was a kid because I used to drink at least ten Sprite's a day. No one warned me about the harm of refined sugar.",1458604800,,1423,4.302238805970149

Within a couple of weeks, he is showing several signs of metabolic syndrome, gaining visceral fat (it's the worst kind), and his blood levels are out of whack. Also, he begins to suffer from a distinct lack of energy. Anyone who doubts that sugar (specifically fructose, which comprises half of the sucrose molecule) is toxic, would do well to watch this film.",1458000000,,631,4.592920353982301

The data isn't brand new, perhaps. But the way it is presented is very clever and well done. I think the filmmaker is a hero.

We are having to shop at the tiny very expensive uber health food store just to find bacon with no added sugar. BACON!  This is one of those topics that I wish was being shown light in the media.

People who eat that way (alkaline diet, macrobiotic, LFRV, or whatever you want to call it) are very lean as well. I'm not sure which would be easier for me to sustain: LFRV or something like Paleo. I gave up all soda (including diet) a couple of months ago and haven't noticed any difference in how I look or feel. I do eat other sugar but thought kicking soda would really make an impact.

7312513,1,B010H6NMKQ,"MASSIVE Amount of false information in this! While I am opposed to excessive use of sugar, some of the statements made in this film are so far from the facts that it is laughable. Example- that a 1.25 liter bottle of Mountain Dew contains 37 teaspoons of sugar. This would amount to 259 grams of sugar in the one bottle. 227 grams is one half pound! So, this would mean there would be OVER ONE HALF POUND of sugar in just the one bottle. Or, just over one fourth kilo. If you do not believe me, just weigh one teaspoon of sugar. I weighed it on a Class V pharmaceutical scale, and it weighs 7 grams per teaspoon. IF there was that much sugar in the bottle (and it would state, in the U.S., at least, that there were 259 grams of sugar per bottle), then the product would more closely resemble thin syrup, than a beverage. It would be difficult to drink at all without diluting it first. Not to mention the fact that a 1.25 liter bottle is quite large, most people would consume no more than the 20 oz. bottle at most (which is HALF the size of the 1.25 liter) at one time. Actually, the most common size for ordinary use is the 1/2 liter (16.9 oz.) bottle. So, with his use of a huge bottle, and gross exaggeration of sugar content, his 37 teaspoons of sugar becomes about 9 teaspoons, which is still a lot, but nothing like what is stated. I agree with many points in this regarding sugar, but outright falsehoods and over dramatization do this doccumentary little service.",1456358400,10,1474,4.344202898550725

7312518,1,B010H6NMKQ,"As a vegan, I was intrigued by the premise of this film--that 'sugar' is bad for you. I have to agree that we eat far too much processed sugar, and it can cause a number of diseases. But he failed to distinguish between the healthy sugar in fruits, with its nutrients and micronutrients, and refined sugar, and also among the many varieties of 'fats', some definitely bad for you (like transfats and the saturated fats in meat products), and others not so bad, like the fats in nuts, seeds, avocados, and coconuts.

At any rate, after 60 days of deliberately consuming a high-processed sugar diet of convenience foods, this young man happily returned to his 'healthy' eating habits, which apparently include a breakfast of high-sodium, high-saturated fat, high-cholesterol bacon and eggs/hold the whole grain toast (which are also ethically and environmentally questionable)!

And besides the high fat and salt content, most bacon has sugar in it.  So you get a triple whammy of bad health.

Up to that point, I thought he formerly ate things like oatmeal with almond milk  and blueberries to start out his day.  Anyway, the sight of that plate of grease kind of invalidated the entire film for me and made me laugh, so it wasn't a total loss. I wonder if this film  is a way of pushing unhealthy Atkins' type or paleo diets on the public.  Or maybe it's just that he's an Aussie and likes to fire up the barbie and slap on the dead animals. Suspicious, to say the least.

Nice young man, very confusing message.",1456012800,8,1512,4.696969696969697

The documentary explains where we are taking excess sugar. It explains the biology and what happens to your body in a very short space of time, from the effects of perceived healthy foods.
Put down that orange juice now!!!
If you are interested in healthy living,meant to lose weight,safely and sustainably, this is a must see.
I have also watched Fed Up and In Defense of Food but found That Sugar Film the most impactful.

7312533,4,B010H6NMKQ,"Very good but frustrating. Just because sugar is REALLY, REALLY bad for you, does not mean that now saturated fats and meat/ dairy products are not bad as well. Processed meats, including bacon, is a known and declared carcinogen, yet here he is frying it up to show how healthy he is now eating since getting back off the sugar. Same with dairy, especially dairy containing growth hormones, antibiotics etc.

It really should not be that hard to understand that more than one thing can be causing our health problems, so we don't keep swinging back and forth like a pendulum - it is saturated fat, no its the sugar!

Still a very well done movie, and the message on processed sugar and carbs is much needed, and it is presented in a very entertaining manner.

7312546,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This was a powerful exposition of sugar and the industry that has made it a (unfortunate) mainstay in the American diet and put many on the path towards metabolic disorder and disease. I thought it compelling at one point when a researcher questioned whether some diseases would even have emerged (or become as prevalent) if sugar were not such a dominant feature in our cultural landscape. It made my wife and I sad as we thought of our own experience with sugar throughout our lives. My son became quite upset at times because there were parts in the film where it was very challenging to watch how people have allowed their lives to be so negatively impacted by this substance.

Clearly, sugar is not evil. That's not the purpose of the movie, BUT you need to put it in its place. IF you can't, then it's best to cut it out of your life. Because it is so addictive, it can easily saturate your life like a hidden poison. Yes, a poison. But, don't let that scare you away from watching That Sugar Film. It's an important commentary in the contemporary diet discussion.

7312595,4,B010H6NMKQ,"This film is a bit scary to watch, simply because it lets you know that basically there is no escaping sugar.  In the film, actor Damon Gameau lets you into his rather healthy life, his Aussie food habits putting most of us to shame with breakfast consisting of nuts, avacado, eggs and perhaps a bit of English bacon (looks a bit more like ham rather than the fatty bacon in the U.S.).  But once he switches off and goes into the world of ""healthy"" eating --tasty yogurts and granolas, health nut bars and smoothies-- his sugar levels spike, his liver begins to show damage after a month, and his cognizant functions begin to show dangerous drops, all of this being watch and regulated by a team of medical specialists, as well as a naturopath.  The point of his film is that our health food industry is packing on the sugar, much to our chagrin.  Be it cane or dextrose or sucrose, the ""natural"" sugar is there and we're gobbling it down in record numbers, about 44 teaspoons a day, and most of that coming from a healthy lifestyle, or so we think.  This will have you rethinking how you eat (smoothis and juices go out the window due to their high sugar...he shows that one apple is great but the average juice drink has four apples and lots of sugar) and how your body processes sugar (and yes, you get to watch his weight go up, up, up with his new healthy diet).  Interesting film and educational...and you'll leave it with one thing planted in your head, which is to read the labels of every food.  Who knew so much sugar was in plain yogurt and skim milk??",1454803200,3,1563,4.40625
7312596,5,B010H6NMKQ,Scary to see how negatively sugar affects us and how everything we eat has hidden sugars. Damon made it fun to watch and learn.,1454716800,,127,4.333333333333333

(PS - I forced my husband to watch it last night, he has been talking about it much of today.)

The truth is that I wonder how many lives would have been said or made easier had sugar been reduced below the 130 pounds he claimed the average American ate in a year. This movie is the best in terms of making one understand what is at stake. A sugar treated palate craves sugary and/or sugar laced products. I leaned from this movie that eating a sugary 'treaat', sex and smoking a cigarette lights up the same area of the brain. It is not the overweight who are out of control, again it is the food manufacturers who are out of control. Nevertheless, the beat goes on.

7312696,4,B010H6NMKQ,"This documentary was entertaining and educational. The only issue I had with it were the times he was adding the ""equivalent"" amounts of sugar to his food and they would just take big scoops with a regular like dinner spoon and call it a teaspoon. That didn't seem to be a major part of the ""experiment"" but for whatever part that was they were incorrect in their measurements by like 3 or 4x.

The taste test he did with the sugar tabs was actually quite funny but had a darker side in that with sugar, just about anything can be made to taste good or at lease OK.

The only down side is that he didn't really cover and track any exercise he did prior to his sugar trial and during it.  He did also not reveal much about his pre-sugar diet and lifestyle.",1453852800,,529,4.207920792079208

I think most already know that too much sugar is bad for you, but if we take an objective view at what we consume, it is amazing just how much sugar we DO consume, especially in the US.  I take these films as a point of view, as too much of anything is bad, and these films are created to show the issue from an edge. You get out if it what you want - for me it was a real awareness that just because it is low fat, mainstream, or 'healthy' that it does not mean it is not full of sugar... the reality is adding it all of it up at the end of the day.

For decades we were told fat makes you fat and all of these fat-free foods were/are laden with sugar, since the removal of fat makes food taste gross.

He puts on a significant amount of weight and appears to be lethargic as the weeks go on.

What is so interesting about his diet is that it consisted of typical foods that most people are already consuming.

7312809,1,B010H6NMKQ,"A rather silly movie.  I thought it was going to be some science based investigation into the problem of sugar in our diets.  First, he introduced his co-stars, an attorney (??) and then his food helper was a naturopath. How about a registered dietician with a food science background?

He did all the serving size calculations in his head.  How about measuring and weighing?

He gained a ton of weight in a very short period of time while claiming to stick to the same amount of exercise and calories.  It's just not possible to put on all that weight while maintaining calories and exercise.

When the diet gets all mixed up with a ton of variables, how do you know it's the sugar that's the problem?  Maybe it was the sudden weight gain, maybe something else.

He only picks on a few types of sugars yet when you look at many food products there are many types of sugars, typically without the word ""sugar"" in the ingredient name.

The movie itself was a knock off of another movie so really not that original or funny either.

I'm certainly not saying that all that sugar in your diet is remotely good for you, but this program did nothing to help the cause.",1453507200,15,1162,4.459715639810427

7312833,5,B010H6NMKQ,"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the better you can eat, the better you will feel.
Of course, broccoli is better for you than donuts, but ... donuts!
But sometimes, we need to know WHY, instead of just being told to put something down.

I know a lot about nutrition and a lot about body processes. I am hypothyroid, and basically have had to learn everything I could medically to try to help myself, because doctors seem to blow off questions about thyroid function. I'm overweight, and have been told some of the most unbelievable whopper stories from doctors you would ever believe. I had one actually tell me that I just had ""elbow disease"", saying my elbow bent to my mouth too often. Um, no.  My tiny mother in law could eat more food than I could hold in two days and still stay tiny. There were obviously other factors in play here, but no one ever had any real answers - just the standard ""eat better"" and ""exercise more"".  I also went on a low fat diet for about six months, and gained steadily the entire time, despite eating sparse plates of food, things like yogurt and grapes for lunches, etc. My dr blamed me, saying I HAD to be eating more than that. I wasn't! But heaven forbid we look deeper than the surface! And when I told him that I didn't feel good when I ate fruit, I was told that was complete nonsense, and that I was making things up just to go off my ""diet"". To this day, fruit gives me a sugar rush that is very unpleasant!  I also don't like pies or cakes, but that's just me - I never liked them. But wave a cookie under my nose, and you have my attention!

I also made changes myself simply because there was zero logic behind some of the ""medical breakthroughs"", like not eating eggs and making an enemy out of butter. I just could not see how butter, made from all natural ingredients from a cow, could possibly be worse than the chemical cocktails whipped up, dyed yellow and sold as butter flavored margarine!  No freaking way. So, we ignored the medical release hype and ate real butter, eggs, meat (*gasp*), and did away with all low fat or diet drinks. Common sense tells you that if they remove the fat from a food, SOMETHING has to replace it so it doesn't fall apart or taste like cardboard. They DO replace the fat - with sugar!

This movie goes WAY below the surface, and gives you a real experience with the world of sugar. We've long known that too much sugar could be bad for you. But other than cavities, WHY avoid it when it tastes so good? (And yes - I know many don't think it tastes good - you are missing the point, so please spare the arguments about bad tasting sweet stuff.)

Damon walks us through the rapid and shocking changes our bodies experience when we give it the everyday diet of typical foods off the grocery store shelves. He doesn't eat candy, donuts or cake. He goes on a month long experience of eating what we normally put in our shopping carts under the guise of ""healthy"" food. Things like fruit juices, yogurts, health bars, chicken with teriyaki sauce, etc etc.

Now, I am very aware that many foods load it with sugar to make the chemicals palatable. We because serious label readers after my husband took a year of culinary classes at an area college. That's when we started to realize the lab experiments being sold as food that loaded our grocery shelves,
I was STUNNED by the amount of sugars hidden in our everyday foods on the shelf!  It changed the way we shopped, but we still were not feeling our best. Despite no longer buying some things like (dare I mention brands?) Hamburger Helper or Yoplait yogurt, which has so much sugar, you might as well have ice cream. We cooked more at home, choosing to control more of what we put into our bodies.

But we still didn't feel our best. There had to be more to this, and while I had been trying to do some of my own research as to WHY my body acted like I was the enemy, and preferred to pack on weight instead of releasing it.

Enter this movie.
Damon - THANK YOU!!
Seeing what is taking place in our livers was a real eye-opener. Yes, we hear about diabetes (either type), triglycerides, cholesterol, etc etc, but the medical community often wants to give you a pill to control the symptoms, instead of explaining what is truly happening and helping you to fix it. After all, medication is highly profitable!

I learned a LOT from this movie.  I have watched it twice, and will watch it several more times to get the information ingrained in my brain.
Damon is every personable and likeable, and the movie is well done - no yawn-worthy droning documentary-style fact recitation. He interacts with the viewers at every step in a very creative manner.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough. I am making everyone in our house watch it at LEAST once, if not more.
Our bodies are so adaptable to changes, and it was both a wow factor and encouraging how quickly things went downhill in his health, but also how quickly things went back to normal after returning to the sugar free foods he previously enjoyed.  Now, I don't enjoy Damon's metabolism and mobility, but there are certainly things that I can incorporate into my daily life to begin the reversal of what could truly be called sugar poisoning with being too far off!

Again - thank you Damon.
You did us all a great service!",1453420800,58,5331,4.423469387755102
7312834,2,B010H6NMKQ,"Damon Gameaus study on the effects of sugar on a healthy human body starts with a montage of colorful confectionery products, scored to Depeche Modes I Just Cant Get Enough. This is both an effective and obvious way of establishing the somewhat-playful, (very mildly) satirical tone the flawed but well-meaning That Sugar Film adopts, to approach the serious issue of sugar-caused obesity in contemporary societies.

Gameau, who wrote, directed, produced and picked himself as the subject of the documentary, takes viewers on a journey, from his home in Australia to the United States and back, wherein he starts at an above-average health and then literally sweetens his way into a near-psychotic frenzy, by eating an average of 40 teaspoons of sugar a day. Supervised by doctors and nutritionists, this rapid switch from a no-sugar regiment to a high-sugar diet results in mood swings, visceral fat around his waist, clearly visible after just 12 days; after 28 days, his liver turns to fat. His pregnant partner Zoe comments hes very easily distracted  but his preoccupied state of mind could also be  at least partially  justified by the making of this elaborate documentarywhile Zoe is pregnant, mind you. (Great timing to purposefully screw up your health, Damon! Tsk-tsk.) At the end, its not about the actual calories  though he gained weight and had a variety of hazardous effects on his body, Gameaus calorie intake hasn't changed from before he embarked on this adventure  its about the source of those calories.

Celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Stephen Fry show up briefly in fragmentary, historical  and irritatingly pedagogical  interludes. Actor Brenton Thwaites appears for all of 30 seconds, just so the host can go inside his toned body in a badly-animated sequence, riding glucose cells. I felt like I was back in my high school biology class, watching an educational video. The addition of celebrities is a gimmick that adds no value, except potentially drawing in a wider audience.

While in the United States, which we all know is the land of obesity, Gameau marvels at Jamba Juices sugar content for a good several minutes. He also encounters country bumpkin Larry, who is addicted to Mountain Dew, and proceeds to get dentures, shown in graphic, painful detail  and then resolutely keeps drinking Mountain Dew, the stubborn loon. Our hosts incisive U.S. adventure concludes with a half-baked inquiry into the machinations that go on behind the curtains of sugar industries, who (gasp!) fund research studies on sugars health effects. My mind was blown at the possibility of such corruption in a country known for its straightforwardness.

The highlight of That Sugar Film comes when Gameau ventures into the small aborigine town of Amata and witnesses a high consumption of sugar in a culture thats historically been known for barely having any sugar in their diet. Introduction of Coca-Cola changed that forever: obesity prevailed, along with a slew of long-term health effects, which led to the small town rebellingBut even with Coke gone, without a proper regiment, they started to resort to other sugary products, and their health now continues to deteriorate. The oldest living culture on Earth is in danger of disappearing. This is a much more affecting and relatable fact than the personal experiment of a well-off documentarian.

Some other (questionable) facts along the way are mildly interesting: we eat an average of six kilograms of sugar a week; if we were to remove all sugar items from supermarket shelves, only 20% of products would remain; sugar mood fluctuations can lead to panic attacks; in 1955 Dwight Eisenhower had a heart attack, which led to heart disease research blaming sugar as a highly probable cause. Though mildly diverting, those factoids could also be easily looked up online within seconds.

While some of the science in That Sugar Film cant be argued with, Gameaus research methods are dubious: he measures his sugar intake very approximately, as displayed in his intricately mathematical calculations at breakfast, or when he eats sugar ON his roasted chicken, which is gross and just unnecessary. Gameau is a TV actor who makes for a surprisingly bland protagonist, jumping around in his yellow briefs a bit too much, and also popping up in a WTF dance video at the end. (Seriously, I don't know what to make of that video. Its almost worth watching the entire film foralmost.)

Frequent animations, understated special effects and quirky editing enhance the narrative, but also remind that without those embellishments, the documentary would be quite dull, a rehashed Super Size Me about facts we should already know: corporate giants rule us, excessive sugar consumption is badIm not saying the world doesnt need a reminder, but That Sugar Film is too self-indulgent, too diluted in its research and conclusion, and too didactic to truly resonate. It made me (guiltily) want an ice-cream Snickers afterwards.",1453334400,3,4975,5.147459727385378

7312840,5,B010H6NMKQ,"Everyone needs to see this film so that they can understand the detrimental effects of our sugar-saturated society.  This should be mandatory viewing by the US Congress.  The 2015 US Dietary Guidelines finally recommended that sugar consumption be limited to 10% of our daily caloric intake or 12 teaspoons (48 grams) per day.  Please note that one typical soda contains about 9 teaspoons. Sugar has been added to our low-fat products for over 45 years to make them palatable; you will learn that it is NOT the fat that is the root of our population becoming fat and sick, it is the sugar.  Take action in your life to reduce consumption of processed foods containing sugar.  I have totally removed sugar from my diet (except for whole fruit) and have lost 50 pounds in the past 18 months.  Also remove grain-based flours, i.e., refined carbohydrates (bread, pasta, pizza, etc.), as they spike your insulin levels just as effectively as sugar which creates systemic inflammation in the body potentially resulting in diabetes, obesity, heart disease, stroke, and cancer.

I am always saying I wish I could have that without the sugar in it. Hoping a company picks this trend up, and comes out with a complete line of food that's sugar free for real, like many have come out with vegan lines, organic and gluten free. I would support that company or even grocery chain. Keep up the great work and promote this movie. It should be in schools.

7312908,5,B010H6NMKQ,"Australian director and human Guinea pig presents an interesting experiment here - eat the Australian sugar average every day for two months, only eat ""healthy"" food, maintain the same level of exercise and watch what happens. Although you might predict some weight gain, the actual results are staggering, and paint a grim picture of the damaging effect of sugar on the general populous in the Western diet. Damon struggles to even maintain the motivation to exercise and eventually finds quitting more difficult due to the addictive nature of the constant sugar high.

The production team have worked hard to keep the presentation interesting, and the content is much more than repeatedly beating the audience with the same mantra of the evils of sugar. Most of the humor translates from Australian but the central message is international - this stuff is killing everyone. His tour covers the effects of Pepsi on an Australian aboriginal tribe through to Mountain Dew in the south east United States, and the pattern is the same - large business arrives, addicts everyone with cheap sugar-based foods and then leaves a trail of a health problems behind.

If you've seen other health documentaries, ""That Sugar Film"" is a refreshing change of beat and has plenty of food for thought even if you're a seasoned gym rat.

Obviously, the results aren't going to be good, and it was interesting to see the changes his body went through. But the movie as a whole wasn't nearly the quality of Supersize Me. There are a lot of cheesy elements, talking heads with no indication of what their credentials are, and lots of screen time given to Gary Taubes, who is well known for misrepresenting scientific studies and interviews with scientists to push his pro-fat agenda (his famous ""fat isn't bad"" New York Times article met with much criticism from the scientists he interviewed who said he completely misrepresented them - and the website ""Plant Positive"" presents an excellent debunking of his work). There is also the usual misrepresentation of dietary changes beginning in the 1970s - if you look at the actual food consumption statistics, Westerners never actually adopted the low-fat diet that was recommended by their governments. There are a few personal stories in the film that are interesting. A look at changes in sugar consumption in an Aboriginal community is worthwhile, as is time spent with a Kentucky dentist looking at the effects of drinking soda on the teeth of the rural poor.

Damon Gameau hit all the right notes to make a interesting but, very fun documentary on a issue we all as humans should talk about and explore

To say sugar isn't a drug is being very naive
Sugar is the biggest most profitable drug globally and nobody can escape it

This film tells the story of Damon Gameau going on a  high sugar diet for two months, he predictably gained 22 pounds, expanded his waist size and developed pre-diabetes.
It might sound a bit hack and lazy it's really not (It's very close to Super Size Me with a Australian twist)
Damon is charming and very likable his wife also makes appearances off and on
He visits a tribe that has been ravaged by the effects of sugar and it's shocking and very sad
Then he takes a holiday to America and makes some good points
His visit to KY and a 17 year old boy that drinks 4-6 cans of Mt. Dew a day will scare anyone
It's a really interesting social commentary on all of us for all of us to live better and be better human beings
I don't see any evil agenda or angle in this documentary
It's a strange learning tool he isn't selling 5 min abs or  botox in a can
It's legit knowledge  10/10

All parents should also watch this film even with your kids if they are old enough to understand the context
It's really frightening and a bit sad how cooperated greed does so much damage to consumers through-out the world

7312931,4,B010H6NMKQ,"I agree with the premise of his film -- that sugar, fructose and carbs are not healthy in the large doses that people have been eating since the mid 20th Century. I personally quit eating sugar, grains, juices and most fruit 6 months ago -- 6 months before seeing this movie. Mostly because of Dr. Robert Lustig's lectures and the evidence that *something* is making the world sick. I do miss the fruit, and have been relying on Aspartame for the sweet taste without the carbs. Who knows if it's better or worse at this point? But the claim that one's brain will  become magically clearer, that one's moods will be stabilized, and that one will be less fat just because they quit eating sugar ... well, it's partially true, but exaggerated, I think, in the way it's presented here in the end. The film itself is playful and a bit goofier than I prefer, but it's a movie, not a news report -- information presented as entertainment for the masses. The ingestion of 40g of sugar a day, a la ""Super Size Me"" style film making seems familiar, and annecdotal, but visually he proves his point. So, overall this is a good production and it achieves it's goal. As one woman says, at least as far as it's presented, Damon is the living proof that not all calories are the same.",1449532800,,1269,4.469827586206897

7312936,5,B010H6NMKQ,"This film has definitely helped me understand more about how fructose affects the liver...and I'm one who tends to make healthy food choices. I hadn't bought a bag of white sugar in 10 years. I wish select scenes were available to show my granddaughter (for example, the animation of how our livers handle different sugars). At age 9, I don't think her interest would last through the whole documentary, yet I would not be surprised if some of her school lunches include way too much hidden sugar, with the best intentions to support her health.

I'm encouraged by Damon's test results, that negative changes can be reversed by better food choices.",1449360000,,648,4.837837837837838
7312937,3,B010H6NMKQ,"Interesting film. I think sugar is poison (but I still eat it sometimes, esp jelly beans and orange Halloween candy pumpkins). But the test in the film I don't think is accurate. For one thing, he's not used to eating sugar. Like other kinds of foods, if you aren't used to eating something, your body won't react very well to then suddenly be eating a lot of it. For example, I don't eat pork. There was ham in something I ate a few years ago (unknown to me), which caused me to get violently ill. No one else got sick. My body just isn't used to eating pork. Same thing with sugar. The other thing is, he measures his intake of sugar. But I think he includes the sugars with naturally-occurring sugars. The point of the movie is that refined sugars are bad for you. Not naturally-occurring sugars. For example, if you eat an apple, you are eating sugar. But you wouldn't say that's a ""sugar food"" or that it has added sugars. It has naturally occurring sugars, which are more slowly metabolized than refined sugars & honey, and which are offset even more by the fiber in the apple. I found that a little problematic in the movie. Third is his comparison of calories to the way he was eating before. He didn't count his pre-test calories, that I could see. He was guessing.  So I found that also problematic for a ""test."" Fourth, it was a bit disingenuous for him to alter his appearance during the test. He would have messy hair, be dressed sloppy, walk with his head bent down, etc. That struck me as hamming it up a bit.  I don't eat sugar regularly, but when I do, my hair doesn't get messy or my clothes sloppy.

Still, there's no denying the overall effect of sugar on his body. Very interesting. Particularly that his abdomen got large. This may explain in part why I've kept off the 25 lbs I lost a few years ago on Weight Watchers & kept off. I had changed my eating habits. One of the big habits I changed was eating waaaay less sugar. When you are eating healthy and eating to maintain a certain weight, there just aren't leftover calories that allow for eating sugary items. I recommend this film to those interested in health. There's even a kickback salute, sort of, to Jack Lalane. For parents who want their kids to grow up healthy, I can tell you that I still remember seeing Jack Lalane on tv when I was a little kid. He would talk about the body, eating right, and he would do exercises. I grew up thinking that doing floor exercises was a normal, every day thing.",1449360000,,2484,4.383947939262473

7312941,3,B010H6NMKQ,"There's too much discussion of sugar (meaning refined sugar) versus fat (meaning animal foods).  The discussion should be about unrefined plants (vegetables, fresh or frozen fruit, beans and lentils, mushrooms, whole raw seeds and nuts) versus refined processed foods and animal foods.  The video does state clearly that eating 4 apples is very different from drinking 4 apples worth of juice, but sadly suggests that 4 apples would be too filling.  As a meal?  Important that these are acknowledged as much more filling when eaten whole.  But the nutritionist talks about protein (used, of course, as synonymous with animal protein).  People are going to walk away from this thinking we should eat a diet rich in animal foods.  But we've known since the 50's that you can rank entire countries by how much animal foods they consume versus heart disease death rates and they fall on a positively sloped line with intercept (zero heart disease) through the origin (zero animal foods) see K.K. Carroll graphs.  The WHO has declared animal foods a carcinogen.  I'm afraid this video has been influenced by the animal foods industry, similarly to the way the Australian government is swayed by the processed food industry or (at a very minimum) just doesn't care.  Would like to see more discussion of refined versus unrefined plants and nutrient dense (fiber, antioxidants, anti cancerous compounds found in) whole plant foods versus refined processed crap and versus disease promoting (high fat - particularly high saturated fat, high cholesterol, and even high animal protein - shown to cause cancer - see the China Study) animal foods.  Very clear and compelling and demonstrative that we have to take responsibility for our own health.  Wonderful to see the medical community support, except for the dietician who's recommending animal foods,  Very ironic that his huge sugar consumption is the average amount consumed!  Utterly tragic about the aborigines, wonder if someone like Geoff Laughton could help them re-establish their birthright by growing their own food in a super ecologically beneficial way.  Afraid, the takeaway might be go Paleo.  I'm sure the animal foods industry likes this video.",1449273600,2,2203,5.215909090909091
7312942,4,B010H6NMKQ,"Pros:
It is difficult to argue against the accumulation of facts; sugar is bad in many ways.  The movie did an excellent job of communicating that through its variety of interviews and the qualitative parts of its presentation.  The visit with the Kentucky dentist was particularly powerful in communicating the harm of sugary beverages.  Also helpful was the description of visceral fat using imaging and how one might be lulled into thinking that a thin layer of fat under the skin might not be bad.

Cons:
I would like to have seen quantitative health data periodically - e.g. at 5 day or 10 day increments.  This would have strengthened the correlation between the quantitative presentation of how much sugar was being consumed.  It could have been easy to flash a table or a graph of key metrics on the screen, such as waistline or metabolic markers and how they changed over time.

The other important detractor is that I would have liked a presentation that I could show my family.  I counted at least one expletive, and a sub theme that runs through the movie is that we see the actor and his girlfriend living together and giving birth to a bastard child.  While I acknowledge that this is a cultural reality, it is not something I want children to see.  So, the dangers of sugar will need to be communicated by other means, at least in my family.",1449273600,,1356,4.635983263598327

7312952,4,B010H6NMKQ,"I appreciate the experiment, and believe that sugar causes health problems, however, the methodology could have been better.  Mr. Gameau claims that in his high-sugar experiment, he avoided junk foods like soda and ice cream.  However, he did not account for the possible influences of all the other nasty ingredients (chemicals) often contained in highly processed foods.  Also, he removed fats from his diet in addition to adding the sugar.

A better test would have been to maintain his existing diet and simply add large quantities of table sugar to it.  Yes, his calorie intake would have increased substantially promoting weight gain, but any metabolic changes would have been more compellingly attributed solely to sugar.",1449100800,,728,5.2956521739130435

7313045,2,B010H6NMKQ,"It is impossible to take this so-called experiment seriously when utterly inaccurate measurements were used.

Just a few examples:

-He uses flatware ""eating teaspoons"" as if they were actual ""measuring teaspoons"".  The two are entirely different in terms of measurements.

-He uses novelty measuring cups which are likely to be inaccurate; it is surprisingly hard to find truly accurate measuring cups--but he should have tried, if he wanted anyone to take this experiment seriously.

-Further, he doesn't even use the measuring cups he has properly.  To properly measure, you fill entirely and then level off.  He would either underfill or overfill.  Likewise when he was scooping amounts with a spoon, each spoonful varied in amount from the next.

-When he scoops out portions with an eating spoon, he generally heaps it overfull.  This typically equals more like one tablespoon.  So, for example, if he added ten of these ""teaspoons"" to his dish, he wasn't eating ""ten teaspoons"" but more like THIRTY teaspoons.

-I question the accuracy of the claim that the ""average"" Australian eats 40 teaspoons of sugar daily.  Further, his documentary experiment is flawed, in that if such average is correct, that allows for people eating actual sweets, which he stated he did not do.  So,  in essence, if he is claiming that the average Australian is consuming 40 teaspoons of sugar daily in just regular foods, then that in itself means the so-called average quoted is utterly incorrect, since the average includes the consumption of sweets.

-So, assuming that throughout his experiment he remained so careless about accurate measuring, he was not consuming 40 teaspoons of sugar daily, but 120 teaspoons of sugar daily.  So yes I imagine he would get fat etc. by consuming three times the normal amount every day.

For a documentary that has a main premise so reliant on accurate measurement comparison, I find it amazing that no one involved in this project bothered to address that very basic flaw.",1448668800,5,1999,5.079754601226994

7313065,4,B010H6NMKQ,"With all of today's processed foods and the steep increase of diseases, this movie is a breath of fresh air of truth.  The millions spent by corporations to keep the public from knowing the truth to continue peddling their high sugar low nutrition food is an excellent example of how ignorant the population is to the effects of excess sugar in the diet.  I guess the status quo is to payoff scientist to portray anything they want to promote their products as safe.  Just because a person has Dr. or PH.D. Next to their name does not guarantee what they say is the truth, do your own research.  As millions die each year around the world, we are still addicted to sugar more than ever before.
  I wish I knew the effects of high fructose corn syrup before I contracted type 2 diabetes.  Since being diagnosed 8 years ago, I started doing research on the causes of contracting diabetes and found the truth along the lines portrayed in That Sugar Movie.  In a quest to not take medications which cause as much damage to the body as excess sugar, I changed my diet and added excersize.  Within months I was able to discontinue all meds completely and brought all medical test into the normal range.  There is too much money involved in the food and medical professions for the truth to be taught.  Many try to share are the message, but most people are ignorant at the expense of their health.  I guess that can of soda, bag of chips, processed food, and candy taste too good to give up andouille will sacrifice their health to continue eating the standard American diet.  The example of mood changes and energy loss is true from my experience.  Thank goodness  Damon had the courage and smarts to make this movie to help the population while he sacrificed his body to make his case and point.  I am saddened to think that most people who watch the movie probably still will not change their ways.",1448496000,6,1895,4.513196480938417

As consumers become more savvy and read food labels, industry has responded by assigning different names to ' harmful' ingredients like sugar and MSG in a deliberate attempt to hide ingredients and deceive the public.  It really infuriates me that a food company can outright lie on their packaging or use vague half truth product descriptions but the FDA attacked Dr. Oz?  We have a serious problem with corruption in this country and until people attack those who are protecting industry's bottom line, nothing will change except that we will continue to get sicker and sicker until we die.

There are an estimated ten teaspoons of sugar in a 12 oz. can of Coke, so consuming 40 teaspoons of sugar a day is the equivalent of drinking four 12 oz. of Coke per day.

So who drinks that much soda a day?  Actually lots of people!  A Seven-Eleven Big Gulp contains 28 oz of soda, the equivalent of 2.3 12 oz. cans.  How many times have we grabbed one of these at the drive-thru during lunch-break then sip on it all afternoon?  How much sugar did you take in with that early-morning sugar-donut / bear-claw grab?  Watching people at the office attacking those two boxes of donuts is like imagining a bunch of Velociraptors ripping apart a cow!  Don't forget to wash it all down with an 8 oz. cup of ""healthy"" orange juice.  How about that mid-afternoon candy bar or one of those so-called ""energy"" drinks like Monster?

You probably drink another can of soda sometime in the evening, maybe pop open a 12 oz. Bud  (145 calories, or 9 teaspoons of sugar equivalent). How about a bowl of ice cream, or a hand full of cookies?  One can easily consume up 20-25 teaspoons of sugar throughout the course of a ""normal"" day, so cramming down an extra 15 teaspoons isn't really all that difficult of a task.",1447977600,7,1545,4.36013986013986

This film serves as good reminder to go beyond the advertised claims of ""healthy"" versions of processed foods to find out how healthy they really are.  For myself, it's a great reminder of one of the best reasons to avoid processed food as much as possible...and to always check the ingredients for added sugars.  I consider it a step up from ""Supersize Me"" as it keeps a much more narrow focus; where SM uses the entire McDonald's menu as an experimental variable, TSF looks only at the effects of switching the good fats in his diet to refined sugars found in foods marketed to the public as healthier alternatives (low-fat, etc).

The host is an entertaining guy who tries an experiment in the vein of Morgan Spurlock, but far less biased and with a modicum of class.

7313213,1,B010H6NMKQ,"Seemed to be an effort to copycat 'Supersize Me'. A lot of the attempts at humor seemed really forced and awkward, and the 'scientific' explanations for things were gimmicky and exaggerated; the overall technical quality reminded me of videos from the 1970s - not in a good way.

The filmmaker (Damon Gameau) seems like a genuinely nice guy and has a beautiful family that he obviously loves - that part was lovely. But the film itself makes a lot of detours in explanations, seems to expect the audience to agree without questioning, and presents some very exaggerated conclusions without any substantive backup. If he's going to claim that he gained weight and ended up with bad lab results based on sugar alone, when he claims he was eating the same number of overall calories and doing the same amount of exercise as he did before his experiment, then he needs to provide some actual basis for his conclusions rather than 'gee whiz, sugar must be BAD'.

I eat very little refined sugar; I exercise way more than the average American; most of what I eat is plant-based. So it's not like I'm unsympathetic to what he's trying to convey here. He just didn't convey it very well, and didn't do it in a very believable way. Information about the consequences of added refined sugar in foods is important, so it's disappointing to see this film, which seems to rely on demonizing sugar and cute, shallow 'explanations' that don't actually explain very much at all.

But better than that, I have more steady energy through the day instead of ups and feeling exhausted (from the sugar).

I've talked to several through the years that are totally close minded to even look at new data... I've struggled with my weight for most of my life and have had only one doctor even mention it  and that wasn't to me... she put it in a file she was forwarding to my new docs when my insurance had changed.. her  recommendation bariatric surgery... again, this was not mentioned to me, just put in a file...

That's exactly what happened in Supersize Me. The movie also brought back some memories for me growing up in the UK because a lot of the Australian brands he featured in the movie that had hidden sugar were also available in the UK.

is as complete and accurate as it should be.  True, if you cut sugar out of your diet your health should markedly improve.  Further benefit would come from reducing fats and eliminating all animal proteins but this is not taught in the film.  I think that the Forks Over Knives documentary was much more thorough and accurate on the subject of diet.

7313319,4,B010H6NMKQ,"I thought this film was not only well directed, put together and well done, but the overall message was fabulous as well. As an individual who leans towards a Vegan lifestyle, I was disappointed that the director didn't pose the question to his audience about the issue of eating meat and dairy as being problematic to one's health in addition to eating processed foods across the food spectrum. But Damon does a great job of staying on point focusing in specifically on the sugar problem that exists not only in America but across the globe. I've learned a lot from watching this film. I'm looking forward to Damon taking on the topic of how our meat and dairy industry are also causing folks to get very very sick after a lifetime accumulation of consuming these products in large amounts. I gave the movie four stars because, Damon, the director, gives us the impression that eating meat and dairy is part of a ""real food"" diet when a tremendous amount of scientific literature that gets shoved under the rug provides quite a different point of view.

7313338,5,B010H6NMKQ,"I knew the majority of information in this film already but I also take a passion in my health and try to follow new findings, studies, and am aware at how processed foods make me feel.  The main reason why I LOVE this film sooooo much!  Is because it's surprising how many people around you just have no idea what healthy even is.  I get in fights with my dad over him trying to tell me he's eating healthy because of labeling on a package or being naive from being brought up in his generation.  We have the internet today and all this information is at our fingertips and he isn't willing to listen to me or look for the information himself.  This movie was the first time I felt like he really heard any of this in the 10+ years of me telling him.  I think this is a great first documentary to show any of your friends are family that you care about but don't take an interest in their own health.  My dad isn't the only one, I run into people constantly that really just don't know any better.  This documentary is funny, easy to understand previously hard to understand concepts and numbers you may have heard and disregarded because it didn't make obvious sense to you, as well as shedding light on some big myths about the current way many people believe.  In the end it explains what is in all the processed food we eat and it's shocking!  It teaches you how to count the big health culprit ""sugar"" and not calories.  And last you really don't have to count anything if you are eating whole foods and not manufactured processed foods.  I'm really happy about this film coming out!  I saw in on a plane and bought it here to share with everyone I can.  I had my parents watch it, My aunt and her daughter are coming over tomorrow to see it, and my newly divorced brother who has an almost 2 year old daughter now can help her get on the right food starting out in life instead of drinking cups full of sugar everyday (I mean apple juice).  It's easy to learn habits young it's much harder to break them when you are older. But you still can if you want it enough!  It takes 3-8 weeks to change a habit.  If you focus on it and make it a priority in your life at this time you will be very thankful in the years to come of your new normal:)",1440028800,3,2247,4.188372093023256

I read about so many different diets it made my head spin until I said screw it, I'm just eating what nature made and nothing else. I was always active I just had a little weight to lose. Once I started eating natural the weight just fell off. I didn't completely understand the science behind why, but it worked. After watching this film I'm 100% sure it's because of all the sugar I cut out of my diet and that our bodies can process natural foods easier than processed crap.

Give this movie a watch then cut out all the sugar from your diet and I bet you'll see a huge difference in your body and mind in a month or two.",1439510400,113,699,4.139705882352941

I thought I was pretty much Sugar free but after watching this I was still eating or drinking about 6 tablespoons of Sugar mostly from juicing apples.  Juicing 4 apples is like drinking liquid sugar. You need the fiber to offset the sugar so I will skip the juicing from now on.  No wonder I couldn't get rid of that last 3 lbs of belly fat.,1438819200,,448,4.126436781609195

Our girls are 7 years old. This is done in an incredibly entertaining way. HUGE kudos to the filmmakers for how they put this together, the segments they chose to include, and the fun visuals and characters they created to convey the information. It was interesting to see how surprised the experts were at the end of the 60 day experiment. This film will REALLY make you examine what's in your kitchen and change what you deem as ""healthy"" choices. America was sold a myth that eating fat will make you fat.

A man with a healthy Paleo diet (no processed foods) is put on a diet of ""healthy sugar"". Watch his body transform right infront of your eyes. How can you deny the affects of sugar?! So this means no icecream or junk food, just a normal ""healthy diet"", anything with sugar on the label like beans, smoothies, yogurt, stuff like that.

He travels to the U.S and Kentuckyt is awful they drink 22 mountain dews a day and 18 yr olds have teeth rotted out of their heads while 2 yr olds drink 8 mountain dews a day in bottles.

As an ex drug addict I can tell you that sugar was a huge thing  for even myself to give up. They did studies on cocaine addicted rats given the choice of sugar water or cocaine, and the mice worked harder and chose the sugar water every time. You crash and have withdrawals it is a drug as far as im concerned.

Ib now eat extremely healthy I eat a paleo diet. General rule of thumb: EAT NOTHING WITH A LABEL. No processed foods , even smoothies or juices contain abnormally high amounts of sugar. Sugar makes you fat, this proves it.",1438473600,3,1147,4.32093023255814

(shameless plug as we are one of those baby-boomer cord cutters, no more satellite/cable bills every month for content that is stale, and over ridden with commercials)

One TOTALLY amazing indicated fact to me was, Damon didn't consume a lot more calories, and while they claimed not much junk food was consumed, I'd disagree.  The foods he did consume might well be considered standard in many homes, but as we should all recognize, many  processed foods have a ton of additives to preserve them, extend their shelf life and of course make them taste good!

His blood work results was extremely enlightening, along with his weight gains and over all mental/physical condition.  Heads up!  if you have liver concerns or diabetes or high blood pressure these claims about sugar, if correct, are alarming!

I've started to gain weight in the past year and can not seem to ""make it go away"". Ummm, sound familiar? Well I'm willing to bet, after we do some adjustments to what we eat around here, that extra weight may not be such a big problem as I imagined.  Oh, and last year the Doctor put me on blood pressure meds for the first time in my life (I'll be 72 this year).  Some other mental and physical changes are going on too that disturb me.

I'm determined to change the way we eat around here and I bet my wife, who suffers from obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, will enjoy the benefits of lowering the sugar intake that WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE WERE GETTING!

So basically Damon consumed about 672 calories of sugar a day but he doesn't fully disclose what else he is putting in his mouth for rest of the day. Refine sugar is no angel and I don't disagree it is bad for teeth or raises triglyceride. But if you claim sugar made you over weight then you have not read any medical literature. Walter Kempner, the founder of the rice diet in 1940 treated people with the common western diseases. It consisted of white rice, refine sugar, and fruits and it fully reversed obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes. So much misinformation in this movie because triglyceride doesn't cause cardiovascular disease. It is caused by LDL. Carbohydrate is the primary source of fuel for the body and it needs to go through de novo lipogenesis to turn sugar into fat. Fat makes you fat because the human physiology wants to store it famine. This movie is trying to confuse the public and push a ketogenic diet. A recent study called ""Dietary carbohydrate intake and mortality: a prospective cohort study and meta-analysis"" also states low carbohydrate diet will shorten your life span.",1534464000,,1197,4.815533980582524
