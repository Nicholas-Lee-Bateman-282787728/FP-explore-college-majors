2517864,5,B000EGDAFC,"The reason this cartoon was discontinued from ""barftoon network"" is because it actually promotes higher morals and ideals, unlike 99% of the toilet humor oriented cartoons playing now.  Think for a moment, corporate heads and the establishment don't want a cartoon that might mold future americans with morals and mental stability, that wouldn't sell rap records and drugs a few years from now, would it? Of course not, of course this is just a drop in the bucket but if most people knew the future plan for this country's future socio-economic destiny, well......a cartoon is the least of our worries. But it is one of the greatest animated series EVER!!!",1144281600,17,656,4.963636363636364
2517865,5,B000EGDAFC,"If you don't know JACK...SAMURAI JACK, that is, is the story of a young samurai warrior seeks to defeat the evil shape-shifting master of darkness, Aku who has destroyed his father's kingdom and imprisoned its people. During a climatic battle between Aku and the samurai, Aku sends the young samurai through a time portal into the far future where Aku rules the Earth. Called ""Samurai Jack"" by the inhabitants of this future world, he seeks a way to return to the past and undo Aku's horrible deeds while battling Aku and his evil minions.

Includes:
Chicken Jack (JACK is turned into a chicken), Jack and the Rave-Slaves (Jack vs. an evil DJ),The GOOD, THE BAD and THE BEAUTIFUL (Jack vs. Bounty-hunters old-west style), Jack & the ZOMBIES (super-fight in a graveyard), JACK in EGYPT (young Jack), JACK and the TRAVELING CREATURES, JACK & THE HAUNTED HOUSE, JACK, the MONKS and THE ANCIENT MASTER'S SON, JACK and the 3 GEMS, JACK & THE LABYBRINTH.

The series won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2004 (it was also nominated in 2002 and 2005) - and artists Scott Willis, Dan Krall and Bryan Andrews received Emmys for Outstanding Individual Achievement In Animation for their work on the series. Beautifully animated, the series makes you feel as if you are looking a high-action, high-color woodcut prints, scored with music both modern and ancient, both electric and serene. Featuring the voice work and the incredible depth of feeling from Phil LaMarr as Jack, and brilliance of Mako as Aku.

This set includes episodes 27 through 39 as released in the season 3 set from May '06. Notable for 2 part ""The Birth of Evil"" revealing AKU's origin in the only story without (MOSTLY) Jack.

NOTE: IF YOU DON'T ALREADY OWN ANY JACK on DVD, YOU MAY WANT TO GET THE Samurai Jack SEASON 1-3 SET WHICH WILL (OBVIOUSLY) INCLUDE THESE DVDS (#1-39), BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO WANT THEM ALL, I PROMISE!",1142812800,37,1907,4.787234042553192
2517866,5,B000EGDAFC,"OMG.. thank  you for coming out with Season 3 finally!! Like all the other reviewers I must say this is a must have... the artwork and overall mood of Samurai Jack is unmatched.  In some episodes there is very little dialogue (like episode 1 part 2) but there is no need due to the masterful artwork... can't wait for the final episodes on DVD as well. I found it very hard to see seasons' 3 and 4 as, just like one of the other reviewers said, they moved it around alot on the time schedule or wouldnt show new episodes for sometime... they really should do a full length movie to tie up loose ends and let Jack go back to defeat Aku!!!!

Samurai Jack forever!!!!!",1141776000,6,665,4.261904761904762
2517867,5,B000EGDAFC,"Really there is no season in Samurai Jack that is better than the others. All seasons are treasures.

I am so looking forward to this release particularly for:

Jack in Egypt: Great fighting and one of my favorite

Haunted House: Fantastic pencil drawn animation

Shinobi: Super Ninja vs master Samurai in style what can you ask more.

Too bad the cartoon network has become Nickelodeon 2.",1140652800,5,389,4.833333333333333
2517868,5,B000EGDAFC,"First of all, this features the EMMY AWARD WINNING 2 PARTER, ""BIRTH OF EVIL"", as well as 28-The Rave, an episode just about every Jack fan puts near the top of their list.

SECOND, YOU DO NOT, i repeat DO .. NOT! have to see the previous 26 episodes to appreciate season 3. The opening credits explain the premise. Once you've seen that, you can jump right in at any time.

I have already seen all 52 episodes of Samurai Jack, and IMHO, the shows improved every season. CERTAIN people will disagree with me, but you can't compare episodes like 4 (the Woolies) or 13 (Aku's Fractured Fairy Tales) with episodes like 43 (the Aku Infection) or 49 (Seasons of Death). While it will probably take till May 2007 for Season 4, that's no reason to not get S3.

I've gone over my theories of why it didn't survive past 52 episodes, including Cartoon Network's excessive time slot re-shuffling, the show's Y7 (family safe) hobbling, and the general American perception of animation being nothing more than a babysitter for infants.

But that's neither here nor there. Even now, years later, I still LOVE Samurai Jack, and I'm preordering this as soon as my tax check comes in.

BTW, if anyone's interested, show creator Genndy Tartakovsky is currently working on a sequel to 80's Henson cult classic The Dark Crystal.

SO PRE ORDER THE THING ALREADY!!!",1140480000,16,1928,4.91588785046729
2517869,5,B000EGDAFC,"WooHoo!  It is about damn time the 3rd season was released!  This was the best show that Cartoon Network ever produced, and in my opinion, they really treated it poorly.  It seemed they kept moving the time slot, and then they would go a long time without running a new episode.  I guess they were too busy with the crap they currently produce like Teen Titans or Hi Hi Puffy Amiyumi!

Anyhow, this show had it all.  Great stories, great music, great visuals.  The animation was kept very basic and that only added to the whole thing.  Yeah, a few of the stories were a little silly, but you can't be perfect all the time.

I wish CN would bring back the show.  Even just a few episodes or maybe a feature length movie.  Genndy Tartakovsky, you are a creative genius!  Don't let Jack die!",1139443200,9,788,4.358620689655172
2517870,5,B000EGDAFC,"I enjoyed watching Samurai Jack Season 1 and 2 and can't wait to get Samurai Jack Season 3 on DVD this May 23, 2006 that will contain episodes 27-39 with bonus features. I can't wait to get Samurai Jack Season 4 on DVD in May 2007 that will contain episodes 40-52 with bonus features that will complete the entire series of Samurai Jack.

2517895,5,B000EGDAFC,"I have no idea which season is the best. Does one need to be better than the other? Or as Jack might ask, Why is the question the mind asks when it thinks that it already knows what, but what the mind knows not is that which it must before the question can be asked. The entire series of SJ is great, season 3 being no exception, with more narrative continuing to be conveyed wordlessly through the cinema of what can be passed off as cartoon art but is really art in animation. Jack continues his quest to defeat the evil Aku and at times seems close to bedeviling the demon, but he hasn't completed his quest yet. More greatness from Genndy Tartakovsky. Of note for this season is the exploration of Akus creation/ history, the silliness of Jack being turned into a chicken who has to gladiate his way back to being human, and an artistically fantastic, perhaps Ringu-inspired haunted house tale that really is scary and electric.",1483833600,,932,4.520710059171598
2517896,5,B000EGDAFC,"The series still is good I remembered. Mako's voice was the perfect choice for the antagonist, Aku. Even 15 years after the show was over,I remember some of the episodes! The style of animation is smooth & is painted without outlines--something you don't see often. I do hope Genny Tartanoffsky is still producing work.  Maybe it's not the most original plots but individual episodes are moving as Jack moves to fulfill has quest. Too bad syndication isn't done on Cartoon Network but it was great for amazon to add this show to its streaming or purchase lineup! It wasn't easy to find in  new or used DVD's of it.",1475020800,,614,4.623853211009174

2517954,5,B000EGDAFC,"Here We are deeper into the action with some more serious face-offs. The Minions of Set, released by Aku, a Rave, to save an innkeeper's young daughter, and the other children of a town from a sinister DJ spinning hypnotic music, a Graveyard, where he fights the dead and Aku both. An undefeatable warrior guarding a gate of time, and where his patience is tested by an overly friendly creature who just wants to be with him. Here, we also see a backstory of Jack's father as he gains the sword that will ultimately vanquish Aku. Here the places are more spooky, such as a haunted house where he must defeat an ancient demon spirit. But there is still a more humorous episode when a cranky wizard turns Jack into a chicken and he finds himself at a cruel handler's beck and call in a fighting arena. clearly a better season.",1404604800,,824,4.4635761589403975

Samurai Jack is one of the greatest cartoons of the early 2000's genndy tartofskis style in animation with this where he shows no visable border is just aww inspiring.

2517966,5,B000EGDAFC,"While not as good as the season before or after it, this is still a good buy.  Here's synopsizes of the episodes from the box, along with my review of each.

27.  Chicken Jack:  Jack is turned into a chicken by a cranky wizard, then gets caught by a ""handler"" & becomes a prize-winning creature combat fighter.  The worst episode of the series.  I admit the beginning is good, but when Jack gets captured, it takes a turn for the worse.  The fights are good, but not what I wanted to see.  You know what I would have done?  After he gets turned into a chicken, he wonders the land searching for a cure & kicking butt along the way.  Just before he found the cure, he would have saved someone from Aku.  Aku getting beat by a chicken, now THAT would be hilarious!  D

28.  Jack & the Rave:  When a man's daughter is kidnapped by Aku's children, Jack must infiltrate a rave to stop the musical brainwashing.  Great story, great action & great music.  Qhat more could you ask for?  A+

29.  The Good, the Bad & the Beautiful:  Jack boards a train to his next destination only to be attacked by a couple of arguing bounty hunters.  One of the best, with a special guest appearance by Quickdraw McGraw, my favorite of the ""old"" Hanna-Barbera characters.  A+

30.  Jack & the Zombies:  Aku leads Jack to a graveyard where the dead begin to rise.  An evil spirit takes over Jack's sword, & Jack fears he's met his end.  An excellent, atmospheric episode.  The silence in this show has never been more deafening.  A+

31.  Jack in Egypt:  Jack must assemble a sacred scarab to call upon Ra for help in fighting evil ancient Egyptian shadow warriors.  A great episode.  A

32.  Jack & the Traveling Creatures:  Jack & his traveling companions - creatures of the air, land & sea - attempt to find a portal for Jack to get home, but discover an undefeatable warrior instead.  One of the best episodes, simply for the ending.  A+

33.  Jack & the Annoying Creature:  An overly-friendly creature begins following Jack, messing up Jack's every move along his quest.  Not the best of the comedic episodes, but it was still pretty funny.  B+

34.  Jack & the Swamp Wizard:  Jack & a swamp wizard travel to the four corners of the earth, collecting pieces that are meant to get Jack back home.  While it had a twist you could see coming, it turned out to be a pretty good episode.  B+

35.  Jack & the Haunted House:  Locked in a spooky, old mansion, Jack discovers he's not alone, and that his new roommates are plotting evil against him.  One of the scariest episodes.  A+

36.  Jack, the Monks and the Ancient Master's Son:  Jack falls into a hidden temple sanctuary to find monks trained like him in the style of the Ancient Master.  Not the best episode, but not the worst either.  B

37-38.  Birth of Evil:  The origin story of Aku, & how Jack's father got the sword that can destroy him.  My family & I are probably the only ones who think so, but I have to say that this is overrated.  We heard about the hype; it won an Emmy, Genndy said he thought it was absolutely perfect but we found it lacking.  I mean, there was never any question as to how it would end, so what was the point?  The beginning was interesting, & the end fight was good, but in between there were too many questions.  How does an attempt to cleanse this evil give it shape & form?  How come the beings who were hunting Aku in the first place don't come down to Earth to finish him off?  And if Jack's father saw all this, then how come he didn't keep the sword on him at all times in case Aku comes back?!  This really should have been just 1 part.  C

39.  Jack & the Labyrinth:  Jack is carefully making his way through a labyrinth to reach a mysterious box.  The problem is, so is another thief.  This is an excellent episode to end the season on.  A+

Like I said, it's still worth getting for the great episodes.  And if you're one of the people who love Birth of Evil, good for you.  I'm just not one of them.",1368576000,,3979,4.276048714479026

2517968,4,B000EGDAFC,"If you're here, you likely know what makes Samurai Jack so great. The stories, the animation, the cinematography is fantastic for an animated show!

He almost never speaks and there are entire episodes with no dialogue, but the action, the editing and the way they take care to show us the tiniest emotions speak volumes for this series.

(When the movie comes out, fight between Jack and Aku is going to have a hard time surpassing that) Birth of Evil, no-brainer goodie. Like all Jack seasons, it has its A, B, C episodes. Still very fun to watch this season, probably my favorite. This and all the other DVDs are essential. Pick em' up.",1288483200,,456,4.506024096385542
2517978,4,B000EGDAFC,"If you're looking at this, then you probably already have the first two seasons and you know (more or less) what to expect by now. That said, this is probably my favorite season of the entire 4.

  The writing improves a bit this season, along with what would be called the ""cinematography"" if this were...you know....not animated. And that's saying a lot because the first two seasons were already pretty awesome. There are many memorable episodes that were a joy to watch. Most notably ""Jack vs. The rave"" and the season finale where you see the birth of Aku. I had a lot of fun watching these discs, and I'm a fully grown adult. This was one of the better shows on television at the time, animated or otherwise. Good fun for the kids, but still enjoyable by adults. Particularly adults who are fans of Akira Kurasawa, or Toshiro Mifune and other samurai flicks.

  A word of note: I WOULD recommend this to parents, albeit with some discretion. It can be a tad violent, so do keep that in mind if you're buying this to entertain the lil ones. I know that here in America,  we tend to flip out more over sex than violence for whatever reason. You can relax there if that sort of thing bothers you. You won't hear any profanity or see so much as a nipple. But if you're actually well adjusted and have more of a problem with your child seeing violent images than half of Janet Jacksons boobs, you may wish to view this along side your child. Might help put things in context for them, know what i'm sayin? For what it's worth, there are FAR worse things out there, and most of Jack's opponents are robots of some sort. So Jack never fights a ""living"" being, if you will. If they can handle ""Star Wars"" then they should be fine watching Samurai Jack. (Which, incidentally is FULL of Star Wars references.)

Fun Fact:

  This same writing/animation team would later go on to make the animated ""Clone Wars"" series. Not the computer animated one, the regular animated one. The actually GOOD one. Yeah, it seems that Ol' George Lucas was rather heavily influenced by the films of Kurasawa. It stands to reason that he would chose this team to produce The Clone Wars: animated series. From a black and white Samurai flick influencing Star Wars....which was the inspiration for much of Samurai Jack...which in turn inspired Lucas to create The Clone Wars. Seems the world keeps moving in circles. Funny old life, innit?

  At the end of the day, I chose to give this DVD 4 stars. It isn't flawless, by any stretch of the imagination, but it's great fun and can usually be found here for a pretty good price.

  If you own seasons one and two, do yourself a favor and pick up three and four, especially if you've found a good deal. You can thank me later.",1264982400,,2748,4.485943775100401

Especially ""Birth of Evil: Part 1 & 2"" as we learn how Aku came into existence. I cannot say how great this season is. It's more dark, better action, and the art is at its best.

2517985,5,B000EGDAFC,"The Third Season of Samurai Jack is full of action, adventure, humor and themes of friendship and courage.  A well balanced season that really shows off the skill and craft of the writers, artists and other people behind the show.  For example, in episode 39 where Jack is being chased on an old fashion Western-Style train by two bounty hunters Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey make a brief appearance as passengers.  Also, the male bounty hunter's voice is done by John DiMaggio.  The same actor who did Bender on Futurama!
And episode 30, in a graveyard, reminds me very much of the Evil Dead movies, right down to a spirit screaming - I will eat your soul!  And does just that when it takes over his sword.  The best episodes, The Birth of Evil Part One and Two, also have commentary.  The show really reaches new heights yet also still keeps the basics of Jack helping the helpless, fight evil and trying to find a way back to his own time and place.",1185321600,2,955,4.454022988505747

2517987,5,B000EGDAFC,"I am not a devotee of animation by any stretch of the animation. Nothing is going to win me over simply because it is animation. Samurai Jack does not win me over because it is animation - because it is so much more than that.

You cannot really go wrong with any season of Samurai Jack. You can easily get away with jumping into the series at any point. So don't feel like you have to start with season 1 and work your way up from there.

I grew up with the old Warner Brothers cartoons that could entertain kids and adults alike. There were jokes that could appeal to various ages with the kids not quite getting the jokes aimed at the adults.

I now have three sons of my own all under the age of 8 and I enjoy watching Samurai Jack with them. It amazes me what they absorb from the series. Of course, there is the high testosterone appeal of the sword fighting. But would you be surprised to hear that Samurai Jack has helped my boys understand the concepts of determination, oppression, empathy,working hard to achieve goals and honor? Just to name a few.

My boys get that good old Jack is good at what he does because he works hard at it. They see Jack try to talk his way out of problems when he can. They see him being sympathetic to others who are hurt or in trouble. They see him standing up against things that are unfair, cruel or just plain nasty.

The conversations I have with my boys during and after an episode of Samurai Jack are amazing. So, while you might just be looking for something to entertain the overgrown kid in your home, don't overlook the kids that are still acting their age.",1172534400,4,1609,4.279605263157895
2517988,5,B000EGDAFC,"Just because the animation is very stylized, don't assume it's a cheap shot like ""South Park"".  This animation is as refined an artwork as the best paintings in the Louve, a work of a fanaticly dedicated team to make the best they possibly can.  IMHO, it's worth it for all the movie tributes alone, though the storytelling is excellent and the artwork of course fantastic.  Furthermore, the art has a ""Retro"" feel, like the 50's, the beatnicks, ""Postmodern Impressionism"" I think.

My favs are the ""Samurai Jack at the Rave"" episode, a parody of the early ""Evils of Rock Music brainwashing our kids"" fictions.  And the ""Haunted House"" one with the tip of the hat to ""The Ring"" involving Jack fighting an ancient Oni who hasn't fought a samurai in aeons and when it seems to win it forgets a critical thing about samurai.  (How far into the future is this?  The mystery is better than any specific date.)  The best IMHO is the story that starts slow, but has great visuals (like a mountain range tribute to YES) and ends up with an intense fight with a Van Diesel like warrior.",1170028800,2,1077,4.572916666666667

(Find a way back to his time to stop the evil Aku from taking over the world). The enemies Jack destroys are always robots or of a supernatural force, I have never seen him kill any living person. He is humble and patient and exudes many qualities I would want in any rolemodel my children would have.

I saw a couple of more episodes and got hooked to the beautiful graphics and amazing animations. Those episodes cannot even be compared to the third seasons. Everything is far better.

To count some specific improvements I'd like to mention the obvious step towards more horror and action which should attract an older criteria of viewers. The martial arts have been carefully studied for this season and this is really noticeable. Far more beautiful backgrounds and basically more of everything. It says in the linernotes that the team wanted to experiment more and it really shows and as far as I see - it's all for the better.

2518005,5,B000EGDAFC,"No sophomore slump for Jack--the concept would be anathema to him.  We get introduced to tons more marvelous characters.  It is difficult to name favorites, because I've seen them all repeatedly.  Above all though Samurai Jack is composed of moments.  There's an aesthetic here, whether it consists of Aku asserting his dominion with just a look (just before he unleashes the laser beams) or Jack smiling at the beauty of the forest in Episode XXIII.

Genndy has created that rare world where we both don't want to live in it and yet are fascinated to escape to it.  The earth ruled by Aku has its own logic that's as complex as the hero and villain.  I personally wouldn't mind traveling with the Traveling Creatures, or stopping for an Aku-burger in the Central Hub, or hanging at the inn with the kindly innkeeper and his daughter.  Even though Jack may hate his time, we love watching the silently eloquent Samurai interact with his world.  Since Jack and Aku both get flustered by unexpected wackiness (Jack with the chicken and the creature, Aku way back in Season 1 with the children), it's amusing to put them against quirky characters.  I could almost wish Aku had had more interaction other than ""you will bow to me"" with his subjects, but that's not his personality.

Yes, Aku is completely evil from birth, which we see the minute after being ""born"" when he taunts Jack's father.  But you wouldn't do Jack any favors by giving him a buffoon.  For Jack's quest to be believable, the villain has to be smart, tough, all-powerful, completely loathsome and yet utterly compelling.  It helps that Aku is voiced by the marvelous Mako, who invented such a unique accent and speech pattern for a completely unforgettable villain.  Aku is marvelously seductive even in his Armageddon moments, and always watchable when he's being foolish.  It's hysterical to watch Aku, as the grumpy old wizard, try to fool Jack again.  His arrogance proves to be his fatal flaw, not to mention his vanity--how many statues and architectural tributes does the guy need?

As an aside, I always thought it would be brilliant to have the final defeat of Aku in the future, and just as Jack jumps into the portal, the Scotsman, the Triseraquin, the talking dogs and the innkeeper among others pull down an enormous statue of Aku in an echo of the statue of Saddam Hussein being toppled. (Aku, like Saddam, is prone to outbursts.)  That would be an epic end to an epic series.",1150934400,,2458,4.741176470588235
2518006,5,B000EGDAFC,"In the third season of Samurai Jack, you will find a great set of cartoons that appeal to both adults and younger children.  For those who are unfamiliar, Samurai Jack is an ancient warrior flung into the future where his arch nemesis, Aku, has achieved dominion on Earth.  Jack must find a way to return to the past and defeat Aku- all this you'll quickly learn in the opening scenes of each episode.

The cartoon typical deals in some type of new adventure in a new and artfully created environment.  The best episodes always involve a great deal of sword fighting where Jack dispatches the robotic minions of Aku.  There are also more than a few episodes that illustrate a moral value, and some that are made to be funny.  So you won't get bored watching more than one in a row.  The animation style has a retro look to it, and it is probably the best cartoon artwork I can think of.

Season Three contains some of the best episodes in the series- my favorites are: when Jack must fight his way out of a haunted graveyard; and when Jack meets warrior monks.  Also noteworthy in this collection is the two part episode that details Aku's creation, and the story of Jack's father.  This one was awarded an Emmy that is well deserved.

Now, I purchase a good deal of TV series DVDs because I am stationed overseas right now- and if I was in the States I'd just watch TV and not get the DVDs.  But Samurai Jack is one of the exceptions.  This is just a great show, and one that you'll enjoy watching again on a Saturday morning.",1149379200,3,1527,4.372340425531915

Season Three of acclaimed Cartoon Network series Samurai Jack is finally out on DVD.  Like the first two seasons, there's two discs with 13 episodes of the really great show and a few DVD extras to boot !  One of those features happen to be ""The Martial Arts of Samurai Jack,"" featuring behind-the-scenes footage uncovering the martial arts moves used in the show; reminicent to moves used in the series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender.""  Another feature is ""The Lost Art Work Gallery"", self-explanatory.

Finally, the moment you've been waiting for, here's the Season Three top five episodes !  Which are:

5. ""The Birth of Evil"" (parts 1 & 2) - This two-part special tells the origin of AKU and how he was first defeated way before the birth of Jack.  To see and hear more, select the optional audio commentary on the two-parter by Genndy Tartakofsky himself in the special features section.

4. ""Chicken Jack"" - A wizard grouchily turns the samurai into a chicken !  But even as a chicken, Jack is still quite the fighter !

3. ""Jack and the Clenches"" (a.k.a. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful"") - Jack is in for a wild, wild-western train ride when he's up against a bounty hunter couple also aboard the train.  (Look for Quick-Draw McGraw in this episode !)

2. ""Jack and the Temple"" - Jack comes across a mysterious hidden temple of monks in training with moves just like Jack.  The Ancient Master of the temple even informs Jack of a time portal to send him home.

1. ""Jack and the Rave Slaves"" - This happens to be my most favorite episode in the whole series !  In this episode, Jack finds a huge group of teenagers pillaging the town he's staying at, and one of them was the innkeeper's daughter.  He goes undercover to find out what's going on.  It turns out the kids were being brainwashed by killer techno-dance music and Jack defeats AKU's dastardly deejay.  (P.S.  I sometimes even supply my OWN dance music for this episode !  I love that kind of music, you know.)

Honorable Mention: ""Jack and the Labyrinth"" - Jack goes through a winding labyrinth in order to find a treasure.  Little did he know, a theif is after this treasure, too.

Well, that about covers it.  I sure hope season four is just as good when that comes out.",1148083200,2,2255,4.5497512437810945

There are more lighthearted episodes like ""Jack and the Creature,"" as well as some strikingly dark episodes - ""Jack and the Haunted House"" is probably one of the best examples I can think of.

This season also comes with the two-parter ""The Birth of Evil,"" focusing on the origins of Aku, his battle with the Emperor (Jack's father), and the forging of the magic sword that Jack will use in the future. Those two episodes alone are probably some of the show's all-time best; very much worth watching.

All in all, I very much enjoyed this season of Jack. Not a dud episode in the entire lineup!",1503446400,,682,4.628099173553719

My 9 year old daughter got caught up in the show and asked me to get the rest of the seasons so that she could see it all.  I started with a couple of my favorites (this one included) but she still wanted more, and to be honest so did I, so i ended up purchasing the full monte, all seasons pack and it's been back to the past for the last few weeks around here, non-stop!",1501804800,,576,3.9655172413793105
