3875374,5,B0028ZDJN0,"Some of the old movies are not only the funniest but make great watching over and over.  I was very pleased when I noticed that these were two for one.  I got it in a heartbeat.  The main chapters have been leads in several other movies.  These are two funny people who make you laugh.  I found the service organization to be very helpful.  Over the holidays lost of mail gets lost or at least we don,t get them.  It is really fine having a back up organization which will help to the extreme.  Heck they even ask if I was happy with their service.  I can assure you I am and was.",1329091200,,580,4.061946902654867

8357212,2,B0028ZDJN0,"I was hoping Parenthood would be great for my grandkids to watch but it was inappropriate sexual behavior and connotations.  It's not what I want to watch as an adult either.  I didn't finish the movie.  Housesitter was funny but it is based on a whole movie of deceptive lies, plus some inappropriate sexual behavior;  Not what I want for me or my family.",1471046400,,356,4.515625
