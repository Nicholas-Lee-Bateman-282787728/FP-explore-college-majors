Fair warning- there is no talking, it is all just animal sounds but you can almost tell what they might be saying based on body language and what they are doing.",1358553600,,282,4.30188679245283

4932429,5,B0062KMEEM,"If you have never seen Timmy Time before it is a spin-off of Shaun the Sheep made especially for preschoolers.  ""Timmy Needs a Bath"" is an adorable DVD featuring Timmy and the gang basically being mischievous kids.  Timmy just keep getting in mess after mess at preschool with mud, glue, and paint!  What is nice about this show is the characters don't talk, they do make noises but no talking so kids can actually focus on the characters actions.  The show made me and my boys laugh at the sillyness of the characters.  There is five fun episodes on this DVD perfect for kids to watch a bunch of episodes in a row or watch one here or there since they are short episodes.",1327881600,3,672,4.387096774193548
