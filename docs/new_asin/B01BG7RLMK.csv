7633410,4,B01BG7RLMK,"Tornado Tag Match: The Usos vs. Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson - All four men were legal under these rules as the match didn't even start in the ring going all around ringside & in the crowd as the Usos relied on their various aerial assault coming off & over the top rope along with moves like a suicide dive while ""The Club"" used their brawling & power advantage as both teams traded momentum with double teaming & having their own ""superkick party"" along with bring an outside object into play in a back & forth brawl.

United States Champion Kalisko vs. Rusev - Kalisko came into this match with a bad back from an attack earlier in the week on RAW with Rusev showcasing his dominance easily using his power & size to slowly work over the back area including a move referencing a former history making United States Champion while Kalisko heavily relied on his fast paced offense including using Rusev's own momentum against him & different aerial moves from various positions of the ring with the high risk not always paying off in a ""David vs. Goliath"" type of match with one man coming out looking the best he has been in over a year.

Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Vaudvillians - New Day was represented by Xavier Woods & Big E with Kofi on the outside as the Vaudvillians were aggressive grounding their opponents & isolating one half of their opponents along with illegal tactics to keep the advantage while New Day relied on their individual strengths from Big E's power to Woods athleticism while reminding everyone they had no issues bending the rules themselves in a short but entertaining match.

Intercontinental Champion The Miz vs. Cesaro vs. Sami Zayn vs. Kevin Owens - This started off with a bang as one man did something right at the opening bell that made everyone freeze for a few seconds before the action picked up with all four interacting their other opponents from one on one to all four together throughout different times leading to such highlights as aerial offense landing on more than one opponent, a Tower Of Doom powerbomb, two men very obsessed with each other throughout the match, who's strategy was to pick the bones of his opponent's work, very unique counters executed, and one of the one of the longest giant swings ever in the match that stole the show as it was non-stop action with one big move after another.

Asylum Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Chris Jericho - This match has been seen in various forms in other organizations (Bowery Death Match in WCW) but it's a steel cage match with weapons hanging from the top to use with the only way to win is by pinfall or submission.  Both men used the cage as a weapon against their opponent while taking advantage of the weapons they were able to use including one that got most references to Perry Saturn than I've heard in almost 15 years while others ranged from kendo sticks to even nunchucks as both men took whippings from a leather strap & trying to avoid objects that haven't been seen in a WWE ring in close to a decade among others in what was the most intense & brutal match in recent WWE ""PG rated"" history that could be classified as ""hardcore.""

Submission Match: Womens Champion Charlotte vs. Natayla - Ric Flair was barred from ringside or Charlotte would forfeit her championship.  Both men went for submissions early on before the action spilled out to the floor with one woman hurting a body part causing her opponent to heavily focused on it as both women went through a series of one submission reversed or eventually countered into another including other impactful moves used by both women from a powerbomb to german suplex in what pretty much as been the story between both women throughout the entire feud where they don't have bad matches but bad finishes.

Extreme Rules Match: WWE Champion Roman Reigns vs. A.J. Styles - Both men started feeling each other out with Roman having the power advantage while Styles had superior speed as the action couldn't be contained in the ring going throughout the crowd even to an area of the arena that we rarely see action at with all areas of ringside coming into play multiple times before settling back in the ring with both men having counters to the other's signature offense such as catching their opponent's in mid-air while also singling out different areas of the body in unique ways along with utilizing weapons & their alliances the best way possible in what was a hell of an awesome main event brawl.

(Kickoff Show) No Disqualification Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. Baron Corbin - A rematch from the previous kickoff show in what saw one man run into the post shoulder first in the opening seconds making that a direct target for his opponent throughout the match while taking advantage of the stipulation only for his opponent to keep having counters to what he did with both men taking advantage of the match stipulation with the winner doing something that everyone found very questionable although the stipulation allowed it.

I enjoyed the show overall as this event is one of my favorites every year so I recommend.",1465171200,2,5082,4.674496644295302
7633411,4,B01BG7RLMK,"The Tornado Tag Team Match: The Usos vs. Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson was a pretty good tag match with the right team getting the win. It was clean just as it should have been too. The crowd booing the Usos was pretty telling. It shows that the fans are sick of cheering for them probably because of their association with Roman Reigns. I think they're good performers just like Reigns is, but if the people reject them its time to change some things about them. I like how G&A have been booked aside from losing clean to The Usos last week. That shouldnt have happened. At least this win makes up for it. The United States Title: Kalisto vs. Rusev was a decent match that had the right guy get the win again. It was a competitive match with Kalisto getting in a decent amount of offense in and it looked like he might retain at a few different points, but I don't think the crowd was that interested in him. The crowd didn't like him that much. Rusev winning after he injured Kalisto and then finishing him with the Accolade put over Rusev strong. Thats what they needed to do with him. The WWE Tag Team Titles: Big E & Xavier Woods (w/Kofi Kingston) vs. Aiden English & Simon Gotch was good mainly because The champs retain as expected. They built up the spot well with The Vaudevillains hitting the Whirling Dervish finisher. Woods kicking out of it drew a good reaction. Big E did an excellent job after the hot tag. Those suplexes were great. Love the spear through the ropes as well. Woods getting the win was awesome because hes not in their matches that often. The guy has a lot of talent too. Give him more of a shot. I think New Day will feud with Gallows & Anderson soon. The WWE Intercontinental Title: The Miz (w/Maryse) vs. Kevin Owens vs. Cesaro vs. Sami Zayn was an outstanding match. I had high hopes for the match, but they even exceeded what I thought they would do just because they built up the nearfalls so well. It looked like any of them could win at different points in the match. Its hard to really go over everything here, but I think its pretty telling when the crowd stands on their feet to give them a standing ovation during the match. Those guys all earned it. Give a lot of credit to Zayn, Cesaro and Owens for being three of the best guys in WWE while Miz isn't at their level all the time, but he showed he is good enough to be part of something special. The big spot was Zayn about to get the win, Owens breaks him out of the ring and Zayn loses his mind because Owens is a thorn in his side again. Great storytelling with those two being involved in that way. Miz getting the stolen pin was the right way to go because hes better with the title while the other three guys should be factors in the Money in the Bank match. I highly recommend you check out that match if you missed it because its one of the best of the year. I don't think a lot of people picked Miz to win. The Asylum Match: Chris Jericho vs. Dean Ambrose well... I was bored by this match. So was the crowd. It was a below average match that went too long and the crowd wasn't that interested in it. It was not the great match that I expected it to be. I like both guys a lot and their last match at Payback was great  its just a case of the gimmick match not working. The weapons they used just didn't work that well. The crowd was pretty lethargic for much of the match. Maybe its because any match that followed the 4-way match was going to get a bad reaction, but I don't think the crowd was into this that much. The only thing that really led to a big reaction was when Jericho was slammed onto the thumbtacks. The crowd loved seeing that. If this was 15 minutes instead of 27 minutes they would have had a better match. It wouldnt shock me if they don't do another Asylum Match for a very long time. This didn't work because some of the weapons came off as comedy spots instead of being a violent match. The Submission Match for the WWE Womens Title: Charlotte vs. Natalya was a solid match from the ladies with another finish that was groan inducing. Im just tired of the baby-face women consistently booked like idiots and usually losing these matches due to a disqualification. I think not being able to do near-falls hurt them a lot because the crowd wasn't into it as much as they might normally react to things. I thought Natalya should have had more offense because she really didn't do much before setting up the Sharpshooters spot. As for the Brooke involvement, I didn't see it coming. Now that Emmas out for the rest of the year most likely after back surgery it seems like they want to pair Brooke with Charlotte. Im okay with it because they are both heels. I actually thought Charlotte would win clean. This would mean they might do this match again although Im not sure what the plan is going forward. I think Sasha Banks will win the Womens Title by SummerSlam. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship Extreme Rules Match: Roman Reigns vs. AJ Styles was great. I loved the intensity of the match, the big spots they did that worked really well and Styles took some huge bumps. The two table bumps plus that nasty Spear on the floor looked like they hurt a lot. Then there was that fall from the top to the floor that may have been the most painful at all. I thought Reigns did a pretty good job of selling the knee injury although he probably could have done it a bit more. The interference by G&A as well as The Usos was pretty obvious before the match started, but I thought the spots they did really worked. There were near-falls because of the interference. Nothing wrong with that. That final spot was awesome looking. Its not easy to jump off the top ropes and drill a guy with a perfect Spear, but they timed it perfectly. If theres a complaint then its the fact that Styles hit the Styles Clash twice (second time on a chair) and Reigns was able to kick out both times. For the second one there was slight distraction caused by an Uso. Basically this the same sort of Superman booking we see from WWEs top faces all the time whether its John Cena, Steve Austin, The Rock, Hulk Hogan or Reigns. Thats just how its always going to be. It does hurt Styles a bit that he could hit Reigns with two finishers and multiple chair shots, yet he wasn't able to win. Reigns hit him with a Spear and that was enough for the win. Granted, Styles did take a beating prior to that with some huge bumps including two table bumps, a nasty bump on the floor and a Spear on the floor. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1465084800,3,6529,4.282362459546926

EXTREME RULES 2016

Spoilers

1.[NO DQ]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS BARON CORBIN-the first match of the night was a rematch from the previous event, both of which were on the kick off show. Like the last this was a good opener for the show as both men seem to work well together. This was a No DQ match as that stipulation lead to the win for Corbin after a low blow on Ziggler. Good match that was helping put Corbin over.

2.[TORNADO TAG MATCH]THE CLUB VS THE USOS-one of the matches I was most looking forward to. These two teams have really good matches together and this was another good one. The Club uses their power to really take it to the Usos here who use that speed to their advantage. But it is not enough as The Club take the victory.

3.[US TITLE]KALISTO VS RUSEV-this was a really good match as I very much enjoyed it. Kalisto had been a great US champ and constantly gives us great matches and moments. Here he tries to out maneuver the bigger Rusev. Rusev of course uses power moves to break Kalisto down. In the end he bends Kalisto all the way back with a vicious camel clutch for the win and title.

4.[TAG TITLE]THE NEW DAY VS THE VAUDEVILLIANS-this was a fun tag match that would see The New Day retain. Of course their pre match stuff was great and entertaining as always. This was a good back and forth but shorter match, I really wish The VV would get more time and more of a push. Still New Day is my favorite tag team, so I hope they keep the belts even longer.

5.[I-C TITLE FATAL 4 WAY]THE MIZ VS CESARO VS KEVIN OWENS VS SAMI ZAYN-possibly the best match on the card as all four men brought their A game here. There were so many highlight reel moments in this match, from high spots to false finishes, it was great. The action is fast paced and seemingly never ending here. The Miz would retain the title here in a very entertaining and hard fought battle.

6.[ASYLUM MATCH]DEAN AMBROSE VS CHRIS JERICHO-I know that other people have said that they didn't really like this match or that it didn't get good until the end with the thumbtacks or something but I liked it. This felt kinda old school a little to me as they used not only their normal moves including finishers but the cage as well. But the weapons they were able to use added a little fun to the match for me. Of course the tacks were cool and brought back that Attitude Era feeling and it made sense for Ambose to win the match he created.

7.[WOMENS TITLE SUBMISSION MATCH]CHARLOTTE VS NATALYA-these two always have good matches together. Their match in NXT was a classic so anytime they battle I am excited. Of course the feud here didn't have the best track record as far as the endings but still I enjoyed them. This was another good match that would see Ric Flair banned from ringside as these two went at it back and forth. Each woman worked over the other getting ready for the submission attempts. Towards the end a friend of Charlottes would come out in the guise of the Nature Boy and help cost Nattie the match.

8.[WWE TITLE EXTREME RULES MATCH]ROMAN REIGNS VS AJ STYLES-best match of the night as AJ just seems to bring out the best in  everybody he wrestles. This was an amazing back and forth brawl with each man looking great here. These two really could work well together, in fact I think AJ has been Romans best opponent, even better than Rollins who returned after this match. The action is fast paced and wild with the Club and Usos getting involved here. AJ even starts his mean streak here in this match with a chair shot segment. Still Roman retains after catching Styles mid-air with a vicious spear. Right after Seth Rollins returns and lays Roman out, the crowd goes crazy.

This was a very good event with some great matches on it, the main event in particular. Highly recommended.",1476835200,,3795,4.399429386590585
