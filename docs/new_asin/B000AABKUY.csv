8076824,5,B000AABKUY,A well written and well delivered history.  Appeals to all ages.  Surprisingly diverse use of tatoos throughout  the world and going back much further than one would expect.,1361232000,,173,5.107142857142857
8076825,3,B000AABKUY,"A good DVD, but even though titled under History, had hoped that there was just more surrounding more current tattoo 'showing', info, skills, art, etc. - i.e., what the historical then evolved to.  Talks about where tattoos were first created thousands of yrs ago (apprx :)), how they were done, where they started, different countries, etc..  It's not a long DVD - 50 minutes - so doing all that, not much time for the current stuff - just a short section at the end...If you're into the history, this is it; not for the stuff today...Had to laugh - if you're curious, you can actually get 27 New - some for 10 cents!!",1284249600,3,619,4.469026548672566
