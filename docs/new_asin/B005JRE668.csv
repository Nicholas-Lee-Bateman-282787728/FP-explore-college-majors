First, that so much damage is done by rats in some areas (NE India), that it occurs in a 48-year cycle, and that nobody of scientific or governmental stature had made any effort to understand and deflect the cause. Turns out the cause, known to villagers, was that local bamboo forests (a key source of other resources for the locals) themselves live a 48-year cycle, and at the end of that period drop enormous amounts of large, fruity seeds to regenerate. The rat population explodes in response, then finds itself with nothing to eat when the seed supply is exhausted and then turn to devastating the farmers' rice crops. The rats then die off, and life returns to 'normal' for another 48 years - except the locals have very little to eat for a year.

An outside investigator from Australia follows this cycle, determines the underlying causation, and suggests the obvious solution - that farmers change the planting of their crops relative to the seed production of the bamboo.",1373760000,,1027,4.769662921348314
