6583297,5,B00MIKOX62,"Roborex is a fun movie geared toward kids.  It is a sci fi film about a boy whose mother is missing.  He has a dog named Rex.  He gets visited by robots from the future who come to alter/protect the future they know.  One is Roborex and the other is DestructoCat.

The acting is really pretty good, especially the two child stars: Kalvin Stinger and Maggie Scott,  Ben Browder of SG-1 and Farscape is good as the boy's father.  Ethan Philips makes a good and funny mad scientist.

The special effects are better than I expected.

The filming is nicely done.

The plot is consistent and plays out well.

Overall a good and very family-friendly movie.  Not just for children.  I enjoyed it and like a more lighthearted approach to sci fi.",1419552000,3,736,4.484848484848484
