5821552,5,B00DJYKDCY,"I find the product very good, but I miss some extras, such as interviews or the making-of. Subtitles or other languages synchronisation would be welcome, too. I also would like to see the remaining seasons released as soon as possible. Actually I think all of them should have been available at the same time.
On the other hand the quality of the film, both sound and image, is terrific, and I think it's been a wonderful idea to release this series.",1376006400,,450,4.567901234567901
5821553,5,B00DJYKDCY,"There are always one or two episodes from each season that really stand out.  For me, the true standout from this season is the two-parter ""Shock"".  I have vivid recollection of this episode, even though I first saw it go to air here in Australia back in the early '70s.  I agree with another reviewer's suggestion that ""Medical Center"" enjoyed some brilliant scriptwriting and expert casting throughout its run.  How great it is to be able to re-live it.  Thank you so much Warner Archive and Amazon.",1375833600,,501,4.712643678160919
5821554,5,B00DJYKDCY,waiting for season four to be available along with the following ones. It has been one of my favorite tv series ever.,1375833600,2,117,4.363636363636363
5821555,5,B00DJYKDCY,"Again, Medical Center : The Complete Third Season has not disappointed this fan. Each episode has brought controversial 1970's topics to the forefront with great acting from all, and again the OR scenes are very real. Chad Everett and James Daly remain the stars, and seem to bring a depth of compassion and reality to all of the episodes.  I love the Third season, but as a huge and dedicated fan of one Chad Everett, I could be said to be a tad biased. I look forward to more of Medical Center !",1375315200,6,497,4.344086021505376
5821556,5,B00DJYKDCY,I chose this rating because I liked the Medical Center series. I received this DVD in good condition & I got it in a timely manner. I dislike nothing about this DVD & it plays well & I would highly recommend it to my family & friends. I can hardly wait for the next season.,1375142400,,273,3.981818181818182

5821558,5,B00DJYKDCY,"Wish Joe Gannon was MY doctor.  Can't wait for season 4, 5, 6 & 7 to be released.  Great program of it's time.",1374624000,,110,3.739130434782609
5821559,4,B00DJYKDCY,"Right from the first episode---awesome!  Very impressed with the quality of drama brought by this season.  Dr Gannon's cool under fire demeanor sets the standard for smarts--setting his patients on the positive track to recovery--physical and emotional.  There's no need for bloody scenes and foul language to ""wake-up-your-viewers"" with scripts like Med Center--and season 3 kicks'it up a notch.  Product of a time when script writers actually used their brains to build suspense.  Try to find that anywhere on TV today.  Warner Archives:  YOU ROCK!!! Keep'em coming!!",1374451200,13,569,5.471264367816092
5821560,5,B00DJYKDCY,Chad Evert is one of my favorite actors.  Always found the show very enteresting.  Hope the come out with the rest of the seasons.,1374278400,,130,4.375
5821561,3,B00DJYKDCY,My wife is a great fan of Medical Center and will get a lot of use out of this product but the quality is somewhat deficient.  There are several times where the video is frozen for a bit and the volume changes between some episodes and even sometimes within an episode.,1373500800,2,269,4.2745098039215685

5821605,5,B00DJYKDCY,"Dr Joe Gannon was my crush at only 10 yrs old , there we're 6 in the family ( children) and I would throw a fit to eatch this every week and most of the time got my way . But this era was time family sat together to watch family shows , I'm so glad I bought these DVDs it brings back so many good memories and even thought The Late Chad Everett was my crush it made me feel like Drs really did care at one time, I miss those days RIP Dr Joe Gannon",1424476800,,447,3.618556701030928

5821607,5,B00DJYKDCY,This set is a great buy. It contains many of my favorite episodes. I get very nostalgic when watching these DVDs. I feel 30+ years younger and watching the DVDs makes exercising and cleaning the house almost enjoyable. It's also interesting to watch them to remember the clothes styles and social issues during the 80s.,1420502400,,319,4.818181818181818
5821608,5,B00DJYKDCY,Just as I remember it! Dreamy Dr Joe Gannon saving lives. Great guest stars. Video quality and sound are excellent.,1418169600,,115,4.8
5821609,5,B00DJYKDCY,Fabulous in every way!  The picture and sound quality are perfect!  It's so great to be able to enjoy this series again.

5821625,5,B00DJYKDCY,"Dr. Gannon continues his warm and caring bed-side manner, combined with fancy cutting and stitching, to heal another batch of guest stars who went on to have a lot of success in the business later. There will be visiting doctor guests like Earl Holliman's Dr. Hayton, (looking great with sun-bleached hair), and recognizable youngsters who went on to starring in other shows, such as Willie Aames. A re-kindled old romance with a visiting French lady doctor adds interest to one of the S3 episodes.",1405987200,,498,4.940476190476191
5821626,5,B00DJYKDCY,I was so excited to get season 3 of Medical Center. It's a pleasure to watch dreamy Dr. Gannon. It holds up to the test of time. I couldn't be happier. My only wish is that it didn't cost as much as it does. Go Dr. Gannon!!!!  I wish you could have been my Dr.!!!,1405296000,,263,3.7818181818181817
5821627,5,B00DJYKDCY,Amazon has the Medical Cener Series and I have them all.  Chad Everett was great as Dr. Gannon I love it.,1403481600,,105,4.0
5821628,5,B00DJYKDCY,"Medical Center Is one of the best blast from the past.
Heads up!

If you do not want to buy the seasons. You can watch them on Warner Online Archive.  $.9.99 a month. They have all kinds of old TV shows and Movies.
Season 1 & 2 are out.on it. 3 & 4 on the way.
And if you need CC Closed Caption.. The Online Ones have it....",1402617600,,324,3.75
5821629,5,B00DJYKDCY,"I grew up in the era of Medical Center, and have been disappointed that it isn't shown on the networks that air the older shows.  I now have the first three seasons, and plan to buy the 4th season soon.",1401321600,,202,4.05
5821630,3,B00DJYKDCY,"I'm finally getting to see all the episodes I missed because my parents censored a lot of them. I came on Monday night at 9:00 P.M.  I don't know why its taking so long for the episodes to come out? Season 4 is out now, I am in shock. One episode on this season is in really bad quality. Where the little boy with the head tumor is trying to get adopted. It is called "" The Nowhere Child"". Glad I have a large flat screen.  I think between Marcus Welby and Medical Center, they pulled all the diseases out of the medical books. People used to think Cancer was contagious! They would fire you, or not hire you. It is funny how these shows give the public the impression that Doctors and Nurses care, some do, but you would be surprised by the number that don't!  Been there got the T- Shirt!",1397952000,,790,4.150326797385621
5821631,5,B00DJYKDCY,This is a great show.  It has a great cast and stories.  Issues of the times are well created in thoughtful drama.  I hope WB remasters the remaining seasons.,1395273600,,158,4.379310344827586

5821643,5,B00DJYKDCY,"The acting, writing, directing were all EXCELLENT in the Medical Center series.  To be able to watch a show that I adored as a teenager is really fascinating!  This show really was a great precursor for shows that followed like ""E.R."".",1392336000,,235,4.7073170731707314

5821645,5,B00DJYKDCY,Medical Center is a great family show. It has real medical problems we face each day. And it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is a show the whole family can watch.  .,1390780800,,172,3.7777777777777777

5821647,5,B00DJYKDCY,"The DVD set played well.  Sound and picture quality are good.

Season three is every bit as good as the first two.  Now I wait hoping for the release of the final four seasons.  This show is SO good!  And I'm in love all over again with the blue eyed wonder Dr. Joe Gannon!",1384646400,,273,3.9814814814814814
5821648,5,B00DJYKDCY,"I was in elementry school when the show debuted. Growing up in south la in the 60's and the 70's this show was top notch. Chad Everett and James Daly never got enough credit for their outstanding acting ability. And Chad was ""DROP DEAD"" gorgeous",1380931200,5,245,4.466666666666667
5821649,3,B00DJYKDCY,"I've enjoyed the third season and own all of the three released as of fall 2013.  But I am finding it expensice and tiresome, so time to move on.",1380672000,2,145,4.0
5821650,5,B00DJYKDCY,"I have been a Medical Center fan since I was 13 and first watched it.  Three years ago I desperately searched for the series and got some low budget copies off TV, complete with commercials, from China!!  I have been scooping up the seasons from Amazon as they are released and gobbling them up.  I am an ICU nurse now.  The medical practices are so antiquated.  Exploratory surgeries were as common as CAT scans are today, no gloves, and a Dr. with way too much time on his hands. Don't watch it with those comparisons in mind.  I watch it for what Joe Gannon did for me at 13, he still does and I can't get enough.",1379030400,2,616,4.222222222222222
5821651,5,B00DJYKDCY,medical centers third season is great it shows why it set the standard for the other medical shows which followed it the acting alone is a great reason to watch it .,1378166400,2,165,4.1875

5821684,5,B00DJYKDCY,"We have the First and Second seasons of this show and it's one of my favorite, top five television series. We watch a lot of old time movies/series on DVD and this is always one that I like to take off the shelf again and again. Chad Everett's acting skills are amazing and the show's cast is usually great as well! We had trouble with the second season, because some of the episodes would freeze up or wouldn't work at all. :-/ But except for a brief pause on a few of the episodes in this third season, we enjoyed it immensely. :) Definitely recommend buying this if you like Chad Everett and lots of action.",1377561600,3,610,4.267241379310345
5821685,2,B00DJYKDCY,"I don't understand why in Hell the sets for this show has to be so expensive..it's a Joke over 40 bucks for a season is really crazy, and not worth the price, as much as i love this show. Warner Bro. you are so Very Greedy...",1377216000,2,225,3.9130434782608696
5821686,5,B00DJYKDCY,I love every part of the third season...I cannot wait for all seasons..Quality is great..waited years for Medical Center and I will be first in line to buy all seasons!,1376956800,,168,4.633333333333334
5821687,4,B00DJYKDCY,"I was delighted to see that season 3 is finally out.  I bought the first two and loved them, though I agree with others that the reproduction quality leaves something to be desired.  I assume that's because they're using worn or damaged film sources and are not cleaning or remastering from originals, as is often the case these days with older releases.  They're also an ""on demand"" product, which sometimes lessens the quality.  Still, I was happy to get them for the content, since I loved Medical Center as a kid, and I was young enough that now I have only vague memories of the plot lines.

This time around, though, that steep $60 price tag has given me pause.  I may buy anyway, but will think it through for a day or two--not sure I can complete a whole series (assuming they ever even release it all) at that price level. So, my rating is based on price and previous products.  If I buy, I may update this review after I see the third season.

9/29/13  A follow-up. I did buy the 3d season at that $60+ price tag, and wished I'd waited a bit: Amazon dropped the price the next day, and I see it's dropped again now. Too bad they don't refund with that kind of timing. I will say that the audio and video quality of these disks are much better than the first two seasons, and the show itself is everything we remember it to be. At this new lower price, I definitely recommend the set. I noticed, too, that there's a listing now for a remastered first season. If I hadn't already bought the first two, that's the one I'd go for.",1376956800,3,1536,4.305555555555555
5821688,4,B00DJYKDCY,"...but they are going to have to come down off that $60 price tag. Really people? Maybe if it was on blu-ray but for DVD's? Nothing I can't live without. It's a good show other than the gouging! My sister was in love with Chad Everett and the storylines, although dated were an honest look at medical dilemnas of that era. It attracted a bevy of great actors that went on to bigger things!",1376784000,,389,4.27027027027027
5821689,5,B00DJYKDCY,"Thrilled to FINALLY get Season Three of Medical Center!  I devoured it so fast, I cried because there are no more available seasons...yet!  I hope Season Four will be forthcoming!  I'm terrified they will stop producing the DVD's before I have the entire collection!  Oddly, the DVD's wouldn't play in my DVD player, but they work in my Blu-Ray so I can live with that.  Seasons One and Two work just fine in either player.  Wondering if anyone else had that problem.",1376438400,3,467,4.634146341463414
