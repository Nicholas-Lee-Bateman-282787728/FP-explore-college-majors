8528231,5,B001AY17GQ,"Love this workout. I do it a couple times a week along with her other DVDs. I own most of Bernadette's DVDs and found her workout routines challenging and invigorating. They work for me as I am seeing changing on my body- more lean and toned. I highly recommend her DVDs for people who prefer low impact, not jumping up and down and love strengthen their abs and other muscles.",1420329600,,377,4.4
8528232,1,B001AY17GQ,"I recently had some injuries and had to scale back on my usual workouts-I had been doing TaeBo,Kelly Coffey,Jackie Warner,etc. I purchased several Bernadette Giorgi dvds as well as other Barre style&toning workouts. I wanted to like this dvd.based on the great reviews but I just found it way too slow for my taste and I just didn't find her very inspiring. I prefer 3 other dvds I purchased-Suzanne Bowen Barre Amped Bootcamp,Suzanne Bowen Tone,Torch&Tighten and Suzanne Bowen Warrior. I had also purchased several other Bernadette dvds and just could not get motivated to continue after the first 10 minutes of each. I guess sometimes you just don't click with a particular trainer.",1398470400,,684,5.061946902654867
8528233,5,B001AY17GQ,"A challenging yet relaxing workout.

Bernadette Giorgi's voice and demeanor is peaceful and calm, yet you will work up a sweat!

I like that it is divided into segments, so on days you don't have alot of time, you can chose to do only floor work or only standing work.
She uses a small Pilates weighted ball for part of the workout. I don't have one, so I used a one pound can and it worked just as well. She also uses a band.
She does show modifications and you don't have to have the Pilates weighted ball or band",1350000000,2,515,4.14
8528234,5,B001AY17GQ,"If you are a stickler for correct technique, you will love Bernadette's videos. She demonstrates each exercise and emphasizes breathing and correct movement. We have this video as well as Pliates Power Bull Sculpt. They are easy and effective to pop in for 15 minutes or one hour. You will definitely see results if done correctly and your friends will notice too!",1277424000,2,364,4.887096774193548
8528235,5,B001AY17GQ,"This dvd/video, like all Bernadette videos, is a real 5 STAR workout experience and purchase. I bought 3 Bernadette dvds for my beach home and , with my many guests,  work out for 30 minutes with one of the videos. Everyone raved--commenting how the time flew and the workout was, unlike other videos, truly wonderful and effective. What more could anyone want? As a result, I now give as gifts and recommend your doing the same!! What could be better---a gift of fitness!! (That works!!)",1260144000,,488,4.741176470588235
