I used this as a supplement to our textbook, and it was so much better and far more interesting than a dry old text book!  Love that the video segments are short and to the point.",1493078400,,252,4.229166666666667

My kids learn well from teachers who are passionate about their subjects.  Dave Raymond is passionate about American History.  Better yet, Dave Raymond is a good storyteller.  Isn't that what history is? Story telling?  Names and dates bah!  I want to know about the people, not just the battles.  How did they think?  Why did they do things?  History comes alive in this video curriculum.  Ideas, cultures, worldviews, motives are all central to this curriculum.  Raymond views American history as the story of the gospel.  As Raymond says, ""American History is best understood through the dual lenses of dramatic story and godly wisdom.""

We watched the first few lessons.  They were lectures with many illustrations throughout.  We're excited about using this next year.

There are 13 weeks of lessons on DVD one.  Each week there are five 10-minute lectures, daily tasks, readings, and weekly exams.  The students also keep a year-long journal.  A Student Reader is included on the DVD.  It's everything you need for one semester of high school History credit.  You would need the second volume as well in order to get a full year of high school credit.

Dave Raymond's American History is good.  I like it.  My kids like it.  I learned. My kids learned.  I appreciated the strong biblical worldview.  We will use this curriculum next year for my 8th and 10th graders.  My 6th grader will probably listen to the lectures as well.

Compass Classroom sent me a free DVD of their American History Volume One lessons in exchange for an honest review.
