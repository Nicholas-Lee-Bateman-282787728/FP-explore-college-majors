4234844,5,B003ZJU92M,"It's a remake of She's The Man (the one with Amanda Bynes) - but executed so well.

In order to fulfill her dream of playing cricket for India, 'carnival dancer' and talented cricketer Veera (Mukherjee) transforms herself into her male alter ego Veer - but she of course finds it difficult to keep up the pretense when she falls for the captain of the team, Rohan (Kapoor).

This movie is so much fun. Predictable, yes. A little parochial, yes. But full of life, well acted, well directed, and with one of the best soundtracks I've heard on a Hindi film. Rani Mukherjee blew me away as Veer/Veera - I had no idea she had such excellent comedy chops. Shahid Kapoor is at his best in many ways - he gets to show some range (including a touch of the dark side he showed in Fida). Most importantly he has shed that ridiculous SRK haircut he has had in past movies. And he is simply mesmerising to watch when he dances.

Mika Singh & Co. pulled out all the stops for a great soundtrack for this movie too - 'Discowale Khisco', 'Hadippa!', 'Bhangra Bistar', are all great beat-driven tunes.

My only minor complaint is the movie falls into the old 'Punjab is the best' rut which probably started with Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.",1259798400,8,1223,4.495495495495495
4234845,3,B003ZJU92M,"Oh don't get me wrong. It was funny, lively, and entertaining. It was not-however-amazing. I had sky high expectations. The music is great and Shahid and Rani are perfect. It's not a movie like Kaminey. Its story has no substance. Kher's idea of making Rani make Shahid fall in love with her is completely out of the blue. Try to see it once for the chemistry and music.

4234846,5,B003ZJU92M,"This is one funny, lively and very entertaining film. Rani Mukherjee goes above and beyond the call of an actor's duty to deliver a great performance. The other actors are focused and very much in tune with their characters. The music is excellent and the dance numbers compliment the spirit and pace of the film. Buy this DVD. You will not regret it! I loved it! Two thumbs way up.",1257811200,10,382,4.4714285714285715

Rani Mukerjee pulls of a great switcheroo, it's delightful to watch, the songs and scenes, and cricket team, and the dashing Shahid Kapoor and his father ( Anupam Kher), Great story, cheers for woman's freedom and abilities breaking out in the culture of suppression, fun and warm and funny. It's in my top of favorites list",1465603200,,352,4.693548387096774

8410555,5,B003ZJU92M,"I have watched this romantic comedy a few times and enjoyed it very much. It offers a loving overview of India's land and culture, which I appreciated because I fell in love with India and its people during my two vacations there. The primary message, however, is the discrimination against women in sports, even if the woman plays ""like a boy"" and is ""the best."" To vie for a place on a cricket team, Veera (a woman) disguises herself as a man, Veer, and juggles both identities, which is hilarious. This is a romantic comedy, and the leads are wildly talented. I unreservedly recommend it.",1481500800,,591,4.6380952380952385
