8113992,3,B000ESST6A,"Although Harmut Haenchen and the Netherlands Philharmonic really deliver on the depth and passion of Wagner's music, I think Richard Wagner would protest that his works were meant to be seen and experienced, as fully-staged music-dramas.

This is somewhat better than a CD, but it could be so much more with full scenery, costuming and staging.

It was annoying to watch Wotan sing about his spear, when it was obvious he wasn't holding one.  Likewise, as he sang to his daughter, Brunnhilde, the farewell aria ""Der Augen leuchendes Paar"" (These sparkling eyes), our Brunnhilde here had already drifted off to sleep.  When he kisses her eyes to take away her divinity and put her to sleep, she was already stiff as a board and sawing logs.  I think this cheated the audience of several touching moments.

Again, all the parts are well-sung, John Keyes and Nadine Secunde sing especially well as Siegmund and Sieglinde.  Their acting, like that of the remainder of the cast, is not especially remarkable, but that is no one's fault, save those who chose not to fully stage Wagner's magnificent work.

Again, you will enjoy the singing and the performance of the music--just wanted you to be forewarned that this is not a fully-staged music drama.",1295740800,5,1245,4.895238095238096
8113993,4,B000ESST6A,"After viewing ""Das Rheingold"", I was convinced that this production would continue to deliver the goods and so I am now pressing on with the second of the four Ring operas.
It's a riveting performance from start to finish. Thankfully, the costuming is a little more bearable than in Rheingold although it must be said that some of the singing is not quite as good as in Rheingold either. John Brocheler continues his amazing performance right where he left off in Rheingold. His confrontations with both Fricka (an awesome performance by Rheinhild Runkel) and Brunnhilde- leading into a heartwrenching performance of Wotan's farewell- in Act 3 are incredible. His acting and pace- as well as his diction and clarity- are really wonderful to observe. John Keyes and Nadine Secunde make an excellent Siegmund and Sieglinde- especially Keyes who has a slightly darker tone than most tenors who do this role (and it works). The Hunding of Kurt Rydl is also very menacing and powerfully sung.
The Brunnhilde of Jeannine Altmeyer is very good too but she strains in the upper register and her opening hoi-jo-to-ho's are a little hit and miss. Having said that, her overall performance is excellent.
The rest of the Valkyrie mob acquit themselves very well in act 3.
The direction is really well done (although I question a couple of things in Act Three such as a lack of embrace by Wotan to Brunnhilde). I found Act Two (which is usually my least favourite act of the Ring) to be nicely moved and consistently entertaining. This is a combination of both excellent stage directing and camera directing.
Underneath all of this is Hartmut Haenchen's excellent conducting. It's a beautifully paced and shaped performance that is allowed to breathe when needed but not rush through. The orchestra play exceptionally well.
This is a worthy addition to the cycle and I look forward to the remaining two operas.",1205625600,3,1897,4.93125
8113994,4,B000ESST6A,"In general, I think this is a fine production of Die Walkure.  Most of the singing is very good, and the costumes are wonderful.  They really needed a stage set to further set them off, however.  It's a bit silly, in act one, hearing Sieglinde singing, ""Who's that lying by the fire,"" when in reality Siegmund is lying in the middle of a bare stage.  Other stage direction also takes some getting used to, like when the Valkyries are watching Brunnhilde approach in Act 3, looking forward, and then she comes up from behind, as Wotan does later in the same act.  Also, in Act 2, there are some strange light effects used on a screen, but the camera angle never allows the DVD-viewing audience to see what is on the screen.  Our view is limited to that bare stage, and the backs of the orchestra musicians' heads.  (They are effectively right in the middle of the stage.)  I wish I'd compared this version to other videos before buying this one, but I'm not displeased by the experience overall.",1204502400,2,994,4.5139664804469275
8113995,5,B000ESST6A,"First off, I must admit that after Opus Arte's other Die Walkure with Bertrand DeBilly, I wasn't expecting much, especially since that seemed to garner better critical praise than this version. This Haenchen version is, with complete confidence and assurance,  exceptionally better and musically the most satisfying Die Walkure I have seen since Barenboims-and this is a hundred times more interesting visually than that one was-and is, of the four Die Walkures I own on DVD-the most intriguing and overall satisying yet, even after repeated viewing. First off, it is not as musically good as the Barenboim-but it comes darn close. Tomlinson is one of, if not the, finest Wotans since Hotter. The Wotan here is John Brocheler. He kind of reminds me of Donald McIntyre, the Wotan with Boulez, they even resemble one another. In the beginning of Act II, he seems to rush his scene with Fricka, overlooking moments others interpret sensually. Despite the uneven stars, he eventually wins you over-though I am unsure how successful it would sound on CD if one were not watching the stage actings. He is fine, though not up to the extraordinary Tomlinson or James Morris\Levine-argueably Tomlinsons' equal.

Fricka is dressed perfectly-She is in all white(after all she is the guardian of marriage-though every production I have seen has her draped in black, Though this white outfit goes to the heart of her character which is steeped in irony and adheres to the technical aspects of marriage rather than the subjective.

It was nice to see Nadine Secunde here as Sieglinde(she was the fine Sieglinde in Barenboims Die Walkure) and is in just as fine a voice-though deeper which suits the role even better. There was only one or two moments where she seemed strained.  I have never forgotten her dramatic cry, the most emotional satifying I have still ever seen, from the Barenboim Walkure(before she runs off to the forest).  Fortunetly, the Siegmunde of John Keyes is a much better singer and an equal actor than her earlier partner with Barenboim-Keyes' Walse cry is incredible for its control-even with a slower tempi-his wintersturme is emotionally riveting-he is the finest aspect of this production and someone I will definetly keep on eye out for in future Wagner productions. Kurt Rydll is a good Hunding, always satifying if not sometimes flat.  Jeanne Altmeyer returns as Brunnhilde-she was the Brunnhilde on the first digital ring conductor by M.Janowski. Though that performance wasn't too highly regarded among critics, I haven't found too many people who didn't like it in the real world. Here, she proves much better than her DVD compatriots(Brunnhilde has been too kindly resurrected on DVD-Hildegard Behrens is horris and well past her prime-Deborah polaski is Deborah Polaski and as about as bad a Brunnhilde as a professional can hear(at least on the DeBilly set-G.Jones was decent but-really the only truly successful Brunnhilde on DVD is Anne Evans with Barenboim and though she is no powerhouse is the Nilsson or Varnay manner, she turns in one hell of a performance. Altmeyer is in the Evans league, and much better than those aforementioned.
Another treat is the orchestra, literally in the middle of the action being seated on the stage surrounded by the characters and set. Haenchen was another new name to me, but if this is any indication of his talent, and how could Wagner not be, he is a name to keep an eye on. He is in total control and delivered a very nuanced and detailed performance. The first act is always a good test because the orchestra is usually deligated to an exclamatory role till the final wintersturme aria. Really from the opening storm he and the Netherlands orchestra play terrifically and with complete competency and control of his idiom. Though not quite up to the standard of Bayreuth but really no one is in Wagner-not even the VPO-but not once, not even once, did I want for a better orchestra or conductor and was always eager to hear more.
To summarize; with Levine, Barenboim, Muti, Pappano, Boulez, and DeBilly on the market-I would recommend this as a strong first choice and even a stronger recommendation to seasoned Wagnerians-even those who are tradionalists since this will satify both them and those seeking new ways to enjoy Wagner. There is nothing here to offend and so much that is intriguing and original.
The stars here are Haenchen(conductor, John Keyes as Siegmunde, and to an extent Brocheler as Wotan, Fricka, and Jeannie Altmeyer.) Despite several misgivings-I cant wait to see all three and would still highly recommend this version. What else can one ask for these days in Wagner",1190592000,17,4658,4.988416988416988
