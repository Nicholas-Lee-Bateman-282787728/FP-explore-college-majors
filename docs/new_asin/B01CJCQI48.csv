7684055,4,B01CJCQI48,"Peggy did not spend as much time with minute instructions, which if you watch these over and over, is a good thing.  It moves along much faster.  I like it very much.  Have been using her dvd's for several years after experiencing sciatica injury which precluded my participation in Bikram Yoga program.",1470614400,2,303,4.788461538461538

7684057,5,B01CJCQI48,"Years ago before I developed diabetes, I was in an accident and I live with metal holding my ankle together.  This makes some exercises, like running, impossible to do without great pain and difficulty.  I walk but that in itself wasn't enough.  After my diabetes diagnosis, I started trying various exercise videos to help keep my glucose numbers down, and this DVD is one of the better videos.  Ms. Cappy truly understands what it's like to be of a certain age, trying yoga for the first time, and dealing with type 2 diabetes.  Pacing is good, volume is excellent, and movements are easy to understand.  Give it a try.  Hopefully, the rewards (better health and body) will be worth the price (which is already reasonable).",1469232000,20,725,4.752

8753289,4,B01CJCQI48,"I was just recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and was looking for some kind of strength training/yoga video. I've dabbled in yoga but am not proficient by any means. The instructor is very calm, explaining each pose so slowly and well that I felt I didn't need to watch along the whole time because I knew exactly what I was supposed to be doing.  There was a seated modification as well. The only thing I didn't like was the last section (there are 7) where there was 10 minutes of thinking about each tiny part of the body while in corpse pose. I would have appreciated just a shorter music segment. But I highly enjoyed this video and I think I will find myself returning to it often.",1516492800,5,692,4.364341085271318
