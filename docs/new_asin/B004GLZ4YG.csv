4373689,4,B004GLZ4YG,"I was lucky enough to see an early screening of this film.  If you love horror films with great twists in them, this is for you!  Family Secret is an independent horror film with a non-existent budget, so as long as you realize that going in and aren't expecting some slick Hollywood Blockbuster full of CGI nonsense, you will enjoy this.  They do manage to throw in a great fight scene at the end of the movie that will leave you breathless. Brings a great new character to the horror genre that will be remembered for a long time.  Can't wait to see if there is a Family Secret 2!",1293408000,3,582,4.263636363636364
4373690,5,B004GLZ4YG,I have been following this film since its production being a big fan of horror film and independent artists.  They did a great job of writing a mind bending thriller and a visual feast.  Cannot say enough good things about it and I am really looking forward to having my own copy.,1292889600,2,280,4.365384615384615
8428851,5,B004GLZ4YG,"Wow. We love this film and Geno in Las Vegas. The dialogue is original, snappy, hilarious and just plain awesome. Tarantino would be impressed. I don't want to give much of the plot away but I really did love the Granny killer too! Get your hands on this movie and enjoy some Indy film making at its finest.",1516406400,,307,4.310344827586207
8428852,4,B004GLZ4YG,"Wow, if you like watching horrible people being hacked up one-by-one, this is for you. It's honestly a very well put-together story with enough surprises, shocking moments and plot twists to keep you watching, entertained and engaged. While the casting may have been a little creative, the acting is energetic and the pacing well managed. Hope to see more from this group!",1415232000,,372,5.016129032258065
8428853,1,B004GLZ4YG,After reading other reviews I decided to give this film a chance. I now wish I didn't. The acting would be considered sub-par even for public access programing and everything else about this film only adds to the heap of a garbage dump that this film is. I couldn't bear sitting through even a third of it. If only negative stars were a rating option.,1331251200,,351,4.415384615384616
8428854,4,B004GLZ4YG,"An abusive relative is scary enough, but what would you do if they started murdering your family and friends from beyond the grave?  What this film lacks in special effects, it makes up for with a great plot that is much more complex than you will find in Hollywood ""blockbuster"" horror films lately.  Family Secret has a cast of true-to-life characters whose deplorable antics made me feel alot better about my own dysfunctional family.  The actors really bring the creepy New England town to life, and I'm sure you will love to hate these denizens from the first scene to the last.  There's laughs, thrills, and kills abound in this independant horror classic.",1328832000,2,662,4.831858407079646
8428855,3,B004GLZ4YG,"It's great to see those who want to create just go out and do it instead of talking about it. It definitly inspired me to write more and work on my own creations. No matter the budget, it's good to see people come together to create their own feature. I had fun!",1312848000,2,262,4.0576923076923075
8428856,4,B004GLZ4YG,"If you are looking for Hollywood dazzle and special effects this movie is not for you. But, if your looking to watch a well written story and decent first time actors perform than is it. I enjoyed it and will watch it again and again.",1301356800,3,234,4.222222222222222
8428857,5,B004GLZ4YG,"We just purchased this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Some parts were pretty funny (whether intentional or not) and some of the acting was great, some just okay, some not so much....but it didn't matter.  Great story, interesting characters, unexpected ending, and a lot of fun to watch.  Looking forward to future movies from this group.",1301356800,2,341,5.053571428571429
8428858,1,B004GLZ4YG,"I cannot believe I wasted money on this home made crap! It really is a joke of a horror movie. Bad acting,low budget quality and the old lady character is very fake looking. With a low budget movie like this I wonder why they just wouldn't cast a REAL old lady. The makeup is laughable.  The real secret is simple, this movie BLOWS! Don't waste your money!",1301184000,2,356,4.313432835820896
8428859,4,B004GLZ4YG,"Just got done watching this on rental instant play. I have watched three of Geno's films. I loved Rise Of The Scarecrows (Geno please make Rise Of The Scarecrows 2!!).. very low budget, great story and it was so funny. Family Secret is the best one yet though. I thought it was a huge step up from his other movies as far as professionalism. I really enjoyed the acting of Foris Day jr and some of the others. The story is very well done and original. The music is another huge plus, great tunes. It was great seeing some of the cast from the old movies like Cedric Howard. The only gripe I had is that Steven Joseph Adams didn't play a bigger role.. that guy is hilarious.",1300492800,3,673,4.265625
8428860,5,B004GLZ4YG,"I have seen pre-release this dysfunctional family horror flick in which my colleague, Dr. Carl Robinson, is an actor. I was surprised that the DVD he ran for me is very entertaining. Shot in Springfield, Mass., the plot thickens compellingly, the scenery is great, and the acting, though semi-professional, proves  quite a draw, in part due to its ""reality TV"" quality. I recommend this movie for a Friday evening, enhanced by a beverage and snacks, and best viewed with some friends.",1299196800,2,484,4.9753086419753085
