2455709,5,B000CCBCJY,"This stand-up is one of my all time favorites.  You definitely have to buy this because it's something you'll want to watch over and over again, as well as introduce it to friends and relatives.  It's hilarious!",1163203200,,211,4.675675675675675
2455710,4,B000CCBCJY,"The material starts off a bit weak, based on how funny Patton Oswalt has been on all those late night talk shows, but it's all worth it for the NPR bit and his musings on his fantasy movie involving Einstein. There is an easter egg on this DVD--It is an amusing home video that Patton made with his friends when they were teenagers, and it is supposed to be HIS version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Don't read any further if you want to find it for yourself. To access it, go to the bonus features section, scroll down to ""Food for thought"" (last one on the list), and left-select it.",1153872000,5,589,4.315315315315315
2455711,4,B000CCBCJY,"I was almost completely unfamiliar with Patton Oswalt before watching this DVD, but now I'm practically a frothing-at-the-mouth fan.  Known as one of the foremost voices in ""alternative comedy,"" Oswalt proudly carries the torch set down by the late Bill Hicks.  Mixing social commentary with gleefully rude scatalogical material, Oswalt goes one further than Hicks with a kind of playful (but pointed) surrealism.  One early routine on ""No Reason To Complain"" is a series of jokes about midgets, but but it's too bizarre and silly to be offensive (""if you throw a midget into a tub of hot water, he turns into chamomile tea!"")--besides, it's also tears-streaming-down-your-face hilarious.  More sharply observant is a bit about the differences between conservative talk radio and NPR, in which racist right-wingers present themselves as rebellious by using hard rock intro music, while their liberal counterparts can only muster ""a sad, lonely saxophone echoing in a sewer pipe.""  Oswalt announces that he hates George W. Bush and the Iraq war (this once got him booed offstage in Pittsburgh, but the audience of fans in the DVD practically give him a standing-O), but he also hates hippies.  ""I'm a man without a country,"" he says.  There's also a completely original take on one of the most overdone subjects of the last few years--Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ.""  While Oswalt notes that he's a ""stone cold atheist,"" he nonetheless gives Gibson kudos for having the balls to make such a violent, raw movie.  Oswalt's propsition for a similar movie he'd like to see just has to be heard to believed.

Now for the bad news: this was originally broadcast as a one-hour special on Comedy Central and was heavily bleeped and edited for television.  While the ""unrated"" DVD eliminates the bleeps, it unfortunately saves the original format, bringing the main program down to just 42 minutes (that's a lot of commercials!).  It's pretty obvious where the ad breaks were, and it hurts the flow of the routine.  One special feature has 16 minutes of deleted scenes, which are indeed even more foul-mouthed than the main portion, but why couldn't Comedy Central present the show as it was originally performed?  It's almost as if it were dumped onto DVD straight from Tivo.  Then there's the matter of having to skip past four obnoxious ads for other DVDs just to get to the main menu--not only doew it make me less interested in the other products, it makes me openly resentful.  If that's the kind of respect Comedy Central gives its talent, it's a wonder anyone wants to work with them.  Now I think I understand why Dave Chappelle quit his highly successful show.

A couple of the other bonus features almost make up for it.  One is an earlier half-hour special (well, 20 minutes without the commercials) of Oswalt in New York, which is almost as funny as the main program.  There's also a series of short low-budget skits featuring Oswalt and a couple of other actors playing supermarket employees who riff on various gen-X topics.  While these kind of old skits show their age a bit, and are clearly indebted to the likes of ""Slackers"" or ""Clerks,"" they're still good for a few giggles.

The next time Oswalt does a show in my area, I definitely plan on being there.  I hope, though, that the next time he does a televised special, he can do it with a premium cable network like HBO, where this great comic's scorching monologues won't be presented as just another product.",1151366400,19,3478,4.857627118644068
2455712,5,B000CCBCJY,"If you're interested in stand-up comedy as an artform, I would put this DVD in your cart for check out right now.  Patton is a master of his craft;  he knows how to push and take you with him.  He plays with the stand-up form in ways that makes you wonder how those safe comedians got any attention.

Plus, he's funny.  Very, very funny.  He's OMG Funny.  He's pee-in-your-pants funny.  His humor and delivery will stick with you forever.

And the extras on the DVD are priceless.",1148169600,4,480,4.425287356321839
2455713,2,B000CCBCJY,"Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version.

The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials.

The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has ""deleted scenes,"" which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time.

So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety.

So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why.",1146614400,52,810,4.416107382550336
2455714,1,B000CCBCJY,"I watch a lot of stand-up comedy and this by far has to be one of the worst I've ever seen.  The jokes are all old and stale.

Oswalt opens with a few lines about midgets.  At this point, while these jokes weren't particularly hilarious, the show looked to have promise.  It was all down hill from there.

He jokes about President Bush, and for as much as I can't stand Bush, hasn't it been overdone by now (or politics in general for that matter)?  And then there's the baby jokes, which even though cliche', are usually still a bit funny.  However, this guy manages to make them not-so.

I know I've seen Oswalt somewhere in the past before and it wasn't this terrible.  However, this performace will be burned forever into my mind as a comedy atrocity.",1145750400,3,755,4.413043478260869
2455715,5,B000CCBCJY,"Terrific DVD all the way through. His take on Midgets and 80s metal videos are particuarly hilarious. What I really liked were the extras though. You get his comedy central presents special and about an additional 30 minutes of stand up from the special that didn't make it to air. Very funny, further proof that patton is one of the few beautiful roses growing out of the manure heap the Blue Collar comedy tour created out of todays stand up scene",1145059200,10,449,4.555555555555555
2455716,5,B000CCBCJY,I just won the DVD on razorfine.com. Patton is great. My frienss were laughing through the whole thing when it aired on comedy central. Patton if you read this when you google yourself one day in the future know that your a great comedian and then do more specials. Also get a better web-site and never get a part like you did on King of Queens cause that isn't you and your funnier than that. You rule!,1144627200,,403,4.246753246753247
2455717,5,B000CCBCJY,"I've watched this so many times on C. Central and now I can finally watch it in its entirety without all their annoying silences on Patton swearing.  It never gets old.  Looking forward to the bonus material as well.  I'm writing this review even before I buy the DVD, that's how awesome it is.  Buy his CDs as well, they have even more material, esp. ""222"".  Rock on PAAS!...I mean Patton!",1144108800,4,390,4.436619718309859
8096919,1,B000CCBCJY,"I LOVE PATTON OSWALT AS SPENCER IN THE TV SHOW KING OF QUEENS AND THE MOVIE BIG FAN. BUT, I TRULY HATED HIS STAND UP ROUTINE. I DID NOT FIND IT FUNNY.",1477785600,,150,3.71875

8096922,5,B000CCBCJY,One of my favorite standup shows of all time! I loved it so much I had to buy it. Really relatable guy.,1364428800,,103,3.727272727272727
8096923,5,B000CCBCJY,"I watch and listen to a lot of stand up comedy. Though I generally find most of it to be pretty funny (I like to laugh, I guess), rarely have I ever been so compelled to laugh out loud, raucously and often, as when I watched this special. Patton Oswalt is absolutely hilarious, and though this production is ony 45 minutes long, it has way more laughs than anything I can think of that's twice as long. His thoughts on how great it would be to die during the Apocalypse were particularly inspiring, though all of his material is fantastic.

Of course, he's not inhibited in the slightest, nor is he shy about using curse words and bringing up subjects that will make the squeamish squirm. If you're easily offended, never, ever watch this special. It will mess you up. It will scar you for life. It just might make you seek therapy. And, of course- never attempt to watch this with your children, even if they're full grown, or you will be thoroughly and irreparably embarrassed!",1363996800,,979,4.531073446327683
8096924,2,B000CCBCJY,"Big fan of Patton Oswalt.  At least I have all his CDs and know them well.

For some reason, though, I wasn't aware of this:  an early DVD of his.  It was unclear whether I already had the material but under a different name, but I ordered it anyway.

Answer to my question?  Sort of:  if you have his other 4 CDs, you have about 70% of this material already.  The rest I had never heard, but wasn't so great.  Not great enough to justify buying this, at any rate.",1326153600,,464,4.066666666666666
8096925,3,B000CCBCJY,"Patton is a funny guy,I like his style and liked his recurring performances on Reno 911! as well as in the movie, I enjoyed No Reason to Complain, I was upset about his AntiBush Rhetoric and religious stuff,but loved how he hates hippies and is one funny dude.",1277942400,2,260,4.4375
8096926,5,B000CCBCJY,"Love, love, love Patton Oswalt.  Bought 'Feeling Kinda Patton' when it first came out, and played it a million times, for anyone with ears to hear it.  Bought the subsequent albums the Tuesday they came out and ran from the store, shredding shrinkwrap through the parking lot, heading straight for my vehicle's CD player.  This special was really good.  It covered a lot of the same material as Feeling Kinda Patton, which is really good, and, and, AND you get his Comedy Central Presents as a bonus feature, which is great (the Anne Frank House bit notwithstanding-kinda weak.)  Good stuff, though, definitely worth the price of whatever they're charging...$12.49 right now?  Sure, easily worth that, get it, throw in 'Feeling Kinda Patton', or 'Werewolves and Lollipops' (awesome) or 'My Weakness is Strong' (also really good) if you need to make that $25 to get the free shipping (they know us too well, I have justified so many purchases to my fiancee as ""well, I needed to get to $25 to get the free shipping"") if they have the ""222"" album, it's worth it, but know that it's two discs, one track each for like over an hour each disc, which involves a lot of either listening commitment or fast forwarding skills on your part.  But, even if you're not lured in by shipping offers (you're a better man than I am, Gunga Din) this is definitely a good purchase as either a jumping off point (and you're not into comedy albums, but hey man, they're coming back in a big way...thanks Dane Cook) or for a completist who, until they release his HBO Comedy Half-Hour...or at least rebroadcast it, y'hear me HBO?, wants everything this very funny man has put out.

[Side note, I saw him on the Comedians of Comedy Tour when they came to Orlando, met him and Brian Posehn afterwards.  Seriously, Patton is so tiny and Posehn is so just gigantically huge (I honestly think that medically speaking, he is a giant) that if they get a rig set up they could be the Master/Blaster of Alternative Comedy, with like Maria Bamford or Sarah Silverman as Auntie Entity, they would rule Bartertown!!!!]",1275955200,,2084,4.6876712328767125
8096927,5,B000CCBCJY,"Yes. Ball busting. You will laugh so hard that your balls will stop working.
