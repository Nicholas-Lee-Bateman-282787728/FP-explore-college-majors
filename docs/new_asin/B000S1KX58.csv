8203783,5,B000S1KX58,"this version of Super Mario World is dubbed in French as many of you have pointed out. there is an English version available by going to the link I've provided below:

http://www.amazon.com/Captain-New-Super-Mario-World/dp/B000UUX2R8/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1341431769&sr=1-2&keywords=captain+n

I will point out that the English version also comes with the 3rd (and final) season of Captain N: The Game Master. which the DVD does give you the option of watching both cartoons either together or independently of each other, so if you're someone who doesn't like or care for Captain N, worry not cause you don't have to suffer through those cartoons if you so choose to. hope this review helps any of you who've purchased the French version of Super Mario World by accident",1341360000,,784,5.579831932773109
