2450718,5,B000BZN1OG,"What can I say?  I rented this one as a new release and was greatly pleased.  Way better than Sky Captain and it does it's job very well with it's own budget crunch and all.  If you like Flash Gordon, Crash Corigon, Ace Drummond, Buck Rogars, Phantom Empire or any of the other classics this film will satisfy.  It does it's job well and I laughed.  Reminds me of somthing I would make. lol

2450719,4,B000BZN1OG,"This serial spoof is a hoot from beginning to end. If you are a fan of the old Saturday Matine serials, you will most likely enjoy this, as I did. I rented this from Blockbuster,and ended up buying it. All the clichs are intact, and the actors play their (ridiculous) characters with extreme earnestness. The cinematography includes scratches and fading at times, to give the impression of age. This must have been an interesting experience in movie theaters, as each episode ends with ""continued next week"", and the following episode recaps what you just saw. There are plenty of laughs, but perhaps you need to be a serial fan to ""get"" all of the references.",1208736000,3,660,4.747826086956522
2450720,2,B000BZN1OG,"We watched the first episode of this last night; it's a new 6-episode serial that is s'posed to be an homage to 1940s serials.

It turns out that it's actually a Naked Gun-type spoof of serials (at least, it is based on the first episode) that has some impressive things in it, but which to me if it were an actual WWII serial would be one of the worst.

Blane Wheatley is the chain-smoking hero the Yellow Jacket, who can fly and control actual yellow jackets. Monica Himmelheber is his chain-smoking secretary/girlfriend, and she's the best thing in the episode (there's a running gag involving her being bonked on the noggin that is the only thing I found amusing here). Kimberly Page is the Dragonfly, a femme fatale Japanese agent who speaks like The Craw on Get Smart. There's a lot of references to ""Japs"" and ""Krauts"" and Y.J. has a professor-sidekick who is dull, which is supposed to be humorous.

The DVD comes with both color and B&W versions; oddly, they both look awful. The B&W looks like the color has simply been turned off, and the color looks like a B&W that's been colorized. Neither are satisfying, but after sampling both we chose the latter for episode one.",1179532800,4,1180,4.609523809523809
2450721,3,B000BZN1OG,"First of all, I share the filmmakers' affection for this B-grade serials and they accomplish much of the 40s and 50s feel. You even have the option of watching ""Monarch"" in either black-and-white or ""faux"" color (a la the colorization processes of the late 80s). I like little authentic touches like the fact that bad guys never lose their fedoras, even in the middle of a raucous fight scene, or how the film is divided into chapters with each chapter summarizing what went on before.

Unfortunately, the film suffers from two fatal flaws: (1) There's simply no way to do on purpose what 1950's directors did by accident. You can't really laugh at the cheesy effects and stiff acting when you know they're doing it on purpose. It's like being told a joke when you know the punchline. It just doesn't work. This leads us to... (2) The film never resolves this in its own mind: Is this a parody or is it an homage? It's far too silly to be taken seriously as an homage (as, say, ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow""), yet it takes itself too seriously to be a parody (for example, those old serials NEVER killed off the comic relief, and this film kills off more than one). The result is a awkward hodgepodge of styles that distracts from the story, one that never has a consistent, fun feel. I give them points for trying, and I'd probably buy more Dark Horse films like this, but I hope they get a clearer vision in mind.

""Destination Mars"" is another B-grade Martian invader flick, with human-looking, English-speaking Martians who turn dead Earth people into robots who set about destroying Earth. I don't want to give away too much about this film, except to say that it's modestly more successful in what it sets out to accomplish. I also recommend that you watch this film before ""Monarch.""",1175040000,14,1800,4.604361370716511
2450722,4,B000BZN1OG,"The highest complement I can give a Sci Fi Film is to say that it reminds me of Saturday afternoons watching Creature Double Feature, and this one

fits the bill!",1170460800,,162,4.4
8094867,3,B000BZN1OG,"Homage to/parody of poverty row serials has fairly impressive production design that is reminiscent of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow on a much tighter budget.  The colors mimic the bargain basement alternative to technicolor that poverty row studios occasionally used; the special effects are cheap looking but in an agreeably ambitious way, and the acting is appropriately stiff, probably a bit too stiff--if movies could exist on production design alone this would be a perfect homage to old-time movie serials.  But, unfortunately, making a nice looking movie isn't quite enough.

Monarch of the Moon, unlike actual serials from all those years ago, seems a bit too satisfied with its campy tone and never actually tries to be exciting--and unlike the old movie parodies of Larry Blamire (The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra; Dark and Stormy Night) it doesn't really boast much in the way of big laughs, leaving Monarch of the Moon a film that is silly and pretty to look at but which wears out its welcome fairly quickly.  Perhaps Monarch of the Moon would work better watched in chapters rather than as a feature, but after about a half an hour I started to become pretty bored, wishing that the visual ambition actually extended to the script as well.

The basic story has an appropriately cheesy American superhero named the Yellow Jacket (because he can control swarms of bees with his mind) facing off against his arch-nemesis Dragonfly, an evil oriental woman who can deflect bullets with a flick of her fans.  Dragonfly is working for the Monarch of the Moon, who is controlling both the Nazis and the Japanese in an attempt to take out America, clearing the way for the colonization and conquering of earth.

Kimberly Page is wonderfully entertaining in the role of Dragonfly, the kind of yellow peril villain that would be considered unbelievably racist today.  Unfortunately, Blane Wheatley doesn't make a similar impression as the hero.  While his acting is stiff enough to feel fairly authentic, he looks more like a supporting player than a leading man, lacking the rugged good looks and athleticism a genuine serial lead would more likely than not possess.  He's also not very funny.  Monica Himmel scores some early laughs as Sally, the prettiest girl the USO has to offer.  Unfortunately, the movie makes the mistake of killing her off and bringing in Maxine, her twin sister.  Both parts are appropriately dated and sexist in different ways, which is obviously the point, but Sally's constant distress and incompetence provides the films biggest laughs while her far more competent and stern twin Maxine just isn't funny.

Monarch of the Moon left a sour taste in my mouth around the time the joyfully goofy Sally was killed off that never quite went away--when you have a likable comic asset killing her is not the best idea, and Monarch of the Moon never seems to recover from this obvious misstep.  On paper, the identical twin thing might have seemed clever but Maxine is the opposite of Sally not just in personality--the character is basically meant to be a wet blanket who initially hates then slowly falls for the movie's hero, but she just isn't any fun compared with her sister.

I really can't recommend Monarch of the Moon, but if you enjoyed Sky Captain and the World of tomorrow, which had similar issues of pairing great production design with a not so good script it's possible you will get a kick out of this as well.  I think Monarch of the Moon was lacking--whether in sincerity or excitement or laughs depends on what kind of movie it actually aspired to be--but if it had gone further with any one of those three it likely would have been a much better movie.  With much more sincerity and less cheap camp Monarch of the Moon could have rivaled Guy Maddin's bizarre and visually sumptuous films.  With many more laughs, Monarch of the Moon could have been to serials what The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra was to 1950's sci-fi.  With some actually suspense and excitement Monarch of the Moon could have been a worthy update of the serial form.  Unfortunately, it ends up none of the above, an empty exercise' in camp that will likely try the patience of most viewers.",1467763200,,4205,4.828690807799443

8094872,4,B000BZN1OG,"A very nicely done sendup of pulp serial adventure that folks used to watch decades ago, but with smart period-looking special effects, just a notch up from those older films.  You can watch in B/W or ""colorized"" formats.  The cast definitely knows how to ""gee whiz and golly!"" dialogue, good clean fun for viewers (note: there are cast members who die indirectly, so it's not a ""nobody gets hurt"" show) and I'm reminded of the same approach as ""Sky Captain: The World of Tomorrow"".  Definitely would recommend this, and I often have it playing in my room as background, as my home office is decorated in science-fiction fashion, so old serials like Rocky Jones, Flash Gordon and Commando Cody are shown on the ""Televiewing Contraption"".

The other disk, ""Destination Mars"" is sort of a remake of a saucer invasion movie from of course Mars.  It's well done also, but although this broke ground for ""Monarch"", I'm inclined to prefer ""Monarch"" over ""Destination."" But it's a nice add for the price.

'nuff said.  Buy this and see for yourself.
