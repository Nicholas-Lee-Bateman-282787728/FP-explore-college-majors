1635302,1,B00005NKSK,"I really had high hopes for this movie. It was filmed in my hometown and had some really big names in it. But after watching it I can honestly say it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Please don't waste your money on this piece of trash, and if you see it on cable change the channel quickly!!!",1006732800,2,303,3.9836065573770494
1635303,1,B00005NKSK,"Antonio Banderas once again proves that he desperately needs to learn to speak English clearly (I haven't understood but a couple of words the man has said in any of his films - and I speak Spanish and English!) - get a diction teacher, man!  Further, Bob Hoskins is a fine actor, but come on Bob - you aren't this desperate for work are you?  Ellen Barkin is here looking just like what I've always thought of her: a tough broad, who should be serving truckers meals instead of acting.  And Wes Bentley - he was the reason I watched this dreck - I used to know him when he was a community theatre-acting kid with stars in his eyes.  He can't really be blamed for being in this (it was his first film)  - I mean look at the big names who were too!  Regardless, he is really quite miscast (obviously only for his quite naturally sinister looking eyes) and struggles to do much by the part.
I'm not really sure if there was a script.  I'm definitely sure that there never should have been.
You know when a movie is made in 1999 and released only in selected European and South African markets, then several years later finally released to cable and video that it must be terrible.  This film proves that contention correct.
I'm sure you can think of a better way to waste a couple hours of your life than bothering with this mess.  I wish I had.",1004313600,5,1343,4.2976190476190474

7947486,4,B00005NKSK,"Too bad it was a flop. I almost let the bad reviews put me off and it sat is a drawer for years after I picked it up in a bargain bin. There are however, some memorable characters and some memorable lines. And I think it took some courage to make such an off-beat film, and a lot of it was done nicely.

I can think of southerners and people with rural roots who will laugh heartily at the stereotypes of ""backwards"" people and communities in Arkansas, thinking ""Yeah, they got it!!!!' This would include some progressives from that environment but also some conservatives I know who are just fed up with that unsophisticated part of Southern/rural culture.

Yet at the other end of the spectrum of reactions of southern or rural people I have known there are some who will be totally embarrassed and incensed to heck. And true, there has been a lot of stereotypical portrayal of ""backwards"" southerners/rurals in films and there is a lot of understandable resentment of this around.

One virtue of the film is also a difficulty. The characters are superficially stereotypes of dumb people and con men etc. but then they develop unexpected depths though not quite in-your-face dramatically obvious. This may throw a lot of viewers off who might just expect that the film is just going to invite them to simply laugh at them for example. But the principle characters are not simply clowns, though certainly not heros either. I suppose some critics will say ""this is a film that can't make up its mind what it wants its characters to be.""  -- or the story to be. I would rephrase it -- that many viewers will be distracted trying to make up their minds what they want the film and characters to be. I don't blame either the filmmakers or the dissatisfied viewers. I think this is just an off-beat film.

Sure, it could have been done differently. It could have been done several ways. It could have been done in a more ""art film"" way for example.

But it got done!!! And I am glad to have seen it. And there were some good laughs, memorable characters, and clever lines. I think there are a lot of viewers who could watch this film just for laughs, and that would be okay. It was a lot better than many, many, many films that get much better box office and reviews and are in fact shallow and formulaic, and are cheap thrills.

Yes there are at least a couple of loose ends in the film. But the story is zany enough and character driven enough that they can be overlooked.

There is a good director's commentary that affirms that the director was much more attentive to the subtleties of characters and plot than the average viewer might have  assumed he was. It is much more informative than the average director's commentary and illustrates that the film had much more serious elements than might have been obvious on the surface and viewed in a confused state.",1357430400,,2861,4.5505836575875485
7947487,1,B00005NKSK,"Let's see: Ellen Barkin, Bob Hoskins, Randy Travis, Wes Bently, Antonio Banderas!, Beau Bridges, Swoosie Kurtz, and Kim Dickens, what could go wrong? Everything. This jalopy is a study in contradictions and an exercise in futility. While watching the film you're struck time and again with thoughts such as ""is this really happening?"", ""did these people really make this film?"" and ""you have to be kidding me."" This film sets itself up as an Indie piece, ok I get that, it's quirky, offbeat, but what it lacks is a compelling indie script because this script is a farce, it lurches from one scene to another, fitfully and painfully from absurdity to incredulity, right up until the end. Also Indie films demand to be cast with indie actors not to be stuffed with big name industry insiders, that's what gives them the raw edge and makes them compelling. In this film however the familiar names overact so grossly that they are the cinematic equivalent of giant inflatables bouncing around a contrived universe, which further distracts. But one can't be sure that even if this film had been correctly cast that it would have been any less farsical. In that regard I think the best performance was turned in by Chad Lindberg who played Reggie Weed the hillbilly brother of Kim Dicken's character (Jesse in Fast and Furious).

This movie just literally starts out bad and never gets better. The central failing is the film's ""identity crisis"" trying at the same time to be both profound and profoundly inane. These are two poles that are like + and -, they really don't go together and inhabit opposite ends of a spectrum. This script simply cant decide whether to be farce in the mold of ""Caddy Shack"" or a provocative sleeper such as ""American Beauty"" which would require continuity of plot and which this film does not offer, so instead it makes gumbo and ends up being like a long Dukes of Hazzard episode meets Bagdad Cafe meets Kalifornia meets Kentucky Fried movie meets Brother Wherefore Art Thou, failing all. It's a comedy where people get murdered and the intellect of the audience gets slaughtered. I read that Antonio Banderas directed this film for nothing as a favor to a friend and that he was eager to do so, which is frightening in light of how badly it has been panned. I suspect this film was made to finish out a production package or to receive tax credits because it's truly pointless from an artistic standpoint. I guess one should also consider the possibility that Banderas was deliberately trying to sabotage this film and to that end employed poor direction and editing and affected that a sincere effort was being made to produce a whimsical low budget Indie road piece with an all star cast, but was in reality sandbagging the effort by misdirection. Alternate uses should be considered; for example if you have the CD you could make it into part of say a mobile sculpture or if you have the VCR tape you could use the tape to perhaps lash logs together for a raft to get off a deserted island, or maybe as a coaster for your cold drink to keep your bureau or side table from getting one of those rings. You'll never get the part of your life back that you spend watching it.",1356480000,,3202,4.657243816254417
7947488,2,B00005NKSK,"This is a terrible movie.  The only reason I ordered it was because it was shot in my hometown.  My children and I were extras.  Thought it would be fun to find ourselves.  Our shot lasted about 2 seconds.  Oh well, I can say that I was in a movie with  Antonio Banderas.",1324684800,,271,4.018867924528302
7947489,4,B00005NKSK,"This movie has a terribly low rating (also at IMDb.com), and I don't understand why. I wonder if a lot of Americans dislike it because it expresses some leftist views?

7947491,2,B00005NKSK,"Whatever happened to Antonio Banderas?  I heard such remarks all over the net when this film ""White River"" arrived at Japan.  The fact is, the film went straight to video here, and the title has been changed to ""Bounty Kid"" (what's that?).  And when I saw the film itself, there appeared the title on the screen -- ""White River Kid"" -- another mystery.  It is as if the film is trying to disguise itself with alternate titles, and my eperience tells me that it is usually a bad sign.
The content justifies the frequent title change, for ""White River"" doesn't know what it wants to be.  It starts with a con man Brother Edgar (Bob Hoskins) talking to the camera, telling us how he is travelling around the Deep South, under the disguise of a monk.  Before you think about that Bob must be a British actor, he goes on, selling cheap socks, with his Mexican partner Molares (Banderas) who pilfers a law book from a library to study something about getting money from lawsuit.  All right.
Then they meet White River Kid (who suddenly appears from the river).  Kid hijacks their car, but somehow instead of plenty of chances to leave him behind, they come to travel together with him after incredibly clumsy set of events that happen later, finally picking up a local waitress and Kid's girlfriend Lisa (who looks like an exact copy of Juliette Lewis of ""Kalifornia"" and ""Natural Born Killer"").  They go to Lisa's home, and they are happy with the strange but kind members of her family.  On the other hand, Brother Edgar meets a blind prostitute Eva (Ellen Barkin), to be drawn to her.
To be fair, there is some quaint feeling of the South in the photography itself, and perhaps with more skills it could be more engaging, but the entire cast looks so awfully miscast and it is so obvious that actors don't know what they are doing, that the result became an utter disaster, without making any point or interest for us.  The film just meanders among  ludiculous situations that are not so funny, dotted with meaningless violence.  I don't write any complaint about the actors, but as for Banderas, who co-executive produced the film, I really want to say: what happened to him!?  Where is cool Zorro?  He intentionally goes for portraying an unusual character (a con man who turns a murderer ... NO!), but this is not what we want.  I really miss him in his splendid Spanish film era, and wish that for once he would go back to his roots with masterful guide of Pedro Almodvar.",1029110400,3,2473,4.586363636363636
7947492,2,B00005NKSK,"As a villain in his native tongue, or your well-meaning slightly gormless, salt-of-the-earth best mate, Bob Hoskins has the roles cornered. But, bless him, he hasn't a bone of mimicry in his cuddly tubby bod.
This is a silly enough story as it is, further bluntened by the sort of genius miscasting that agents and studio hacks usually only dream of.
Unlike their actress sisters, Brit male thespians are not known for convincing American accents. That Branagh fellow in 'Dead Again' defines the malaise. In the flop under discussion, Bob H is meant to be a cheery con-man monk from the deep south.
His inability to hit a single convincing vowel is made further excruciating by the slides into dud South African or, more understandable, his native south London drawl. Painful - and Hoskins being no fool about the roles he can take, the man himself probably chafed and winced just as keenly.",1020556800,,891,4.830065359477124
7947493,5,B00005NKSK,"I am 48 years old.  Had I seen this movie 25 years ago, I would have considered it unforgivably absurd.  Today, I welcome it with it's view that takes in the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful, and loves it unconditionally and unreservedly.
Everyone of the characters in this movie reminds me strongly of someone I have personally known (of course, I do live in central Texas). The events are unconventional.  This is comforting and reassuring, for as I have lived my life in Texas, there are so many events that I think to myself, ""No one would believe this if I told it straight.""  It is a strain to continually strive to reconstruct and present one's life as being conventional and normal and acceptable.  I wonder if it is just me, or just central Texas, or just my socio-economic category ( identical, at this writing to that of the characters in this movie) that makes me feel ""not normal.""  Anyway, at this stage of my life, I am no longer worried about achieving normalcy, although for years it was a prime concern.  Enjoy this movie of life, love, death, and grief, and know, that on some level, this is normal.",1011312000,10,1128,4.527093596059113
