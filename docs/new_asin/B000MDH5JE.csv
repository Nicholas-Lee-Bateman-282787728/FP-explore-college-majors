2728301,2,B000MDH5JE,"I bought this because of so many good reviews. But it wasn't my cup of tea.

Just some background on me: I am 25 and wanted to get into exercising. On a scale of 1 to 10, I am definitely a 1 and compared to my phisical activity level and what the do in the DVD with the body rolls and such, this DVD is a possible 4!

Likes:
It has..
-Warm-Up and Cool-Down sections. (Some DVD's don't have this feature.)
-Beginner Modifications.
-A feature that stops the exercise to show you the way to do it correctly, then takes you back where you were to continue doing it the right way.

Dislikes:
-SUPER BORING.
I tried to watch the before before beginning the exercises, I couldn't even get through that. I was bored. If I can't be interested in watching it, I won't be interested in doing it. I am trying to tone up my body, and this didn't help. To me, she moved too fast. She explained the movements, but I couldn't keep up.

-Geared towards Pilates. I don't how to do Pilates, nor am I interested in them, so this DVD is useless to me.",1233532800,,1030,4.186868686868687
2728302,5,B000MDH5JE,"This gets everything.  The moves are somewhat involved, you have to pay attention where to place the band.  Alot of variey that I haven't seen in other workouts. The only thing is that I think the band is too thin.  You can see through it somewhat.  Some people may need a heavier band, but otherwise, its a great workout.",1223078400,,322,4.406779661016949
2728303,3,B000MDH5JE,"this was well done but too much explanation at the beginning of each exercise.  Once thru I got impatient waiting for her to explain.
The Exercises are helpfull though.",1199664000,,168,4.793103448275862
2728304,5,B000MDH5JE,"I've bought a few Prevention fitness DVDs and found them uninspiring, a bit too much of the same old same old.  I got this one because it had Lara Hudson's name on it, and I like her - she uses innovative takes on classic pilates moves,. her cueing is excellent - she gives you time to set up and explains the moves without wasting precious time - and she's pleasant without being loud or overly perky... no whooping, ever - thank gods!  (Yes, I am super fussy..... )

This is yet another goody, and the only Prevention keeper.  Afterwards, I felt muscles I hadn't felt in a while.  There's a floor routine and a standing routine, both make use of the (included) band, but one modifier uses weights.  Simpler AND more advanced moves are also demo'd.  The whole routine comes to just under an hour.  You can of course split it up.  I enjoyed it, and it's going into my regular rotation.

I hope to see more DVDs by Lara Hudson.",1194220800,14,926,4.362573099415204
2728305,5,B000MDH5JE,What a great idea and so fun.  Just what Pilates needs for the arms.,1186185600,2,68,3.857142857142857
2728306,4,B000MDH5JE,"The instructions are clear, the movements are simple yet challenging if you want to make them flow.  The class is not so exhausting that you cannot do it every day (or very other day in combination with something else).  I also like the fact that the class is divided into 2 segents one pilates one ballet core- so that you can do one 1/2 if you have a very limited amount of time.  The key for me was to figure out how to place the band so that it would not snap out.  I would recommend this tape.  actually, I bought the same for my mother- who loves it too.",1185148800,4,560,4.054545454545455
2728307,4,B000MDH5JE,"This is a great relaxing video. If your having a tired day you can pop this in and just to a light modified workout, but if you want to build strength in you arms, abs, and legs, just add the resistant band and the free weights and you'll be toned in no time.",1180483200,10,259,3.9056603773584904
2728308,5,B000MDH5JE,"If you want to strengthen your muscles and tone up, then this is for you.  I really like Prevention dvds because they are doable for almost everyone.  They provide a 6 foot band you can use in this routine and I found that's helped a lot for my flexability.

In this, there is toning done standing up and a floor routine.  It's a good way to help your posture and lengthen your muscles.  It has a ballet inspired segment (for which you'll need some balance) and I love the unique way that you can choose which music you want - either relaxing or energising.  I thought the instructor was really good and she cues well so you know what's up next.

The whole workout is done in under an hour and I've done it twice already and found it fun and it worked different muscles that I haven't worked out in a while.  I'm going to continue doing this for a while yet, because I really like this one and recommend it to everyone.",1178928000,17,919,4.241379310344827

8168010,2,B000MDH5JE,"I was very disappointed with this dvd.  Unless you are a super beginner, I don't think you'll get much of a workout.  I spent over 30 minutes doing it and felt very little - barely got warm or worked up my heartbeat.  Plus, Lara Hudson talks way too much - so you are just standing around listening to her give explanations on how to hold the stretchy band etc.  She often does not do enough reps of a movement to make it effective, and then she gives you a rest period afterwards! (Isn't that what the pause button on the dvd player is for?)  To get more of a workout I jogged during those times when she was babbling on and on with instructions.

I would have given this dvd one star, but I thought Lara Hudson did seem like she was trying really hard.  Plus, if you are truly brand new at exercise this could be a good starter workout.  Or it might be good for a day when you are feeling on the sick and achy side, then you should be able to do this workout.  Otherwise, please spend your money on the myriad of better routines - consider Chris Fretag, also of Prevention magazine.  She is among my favorites.",1428624000,3,1112,4.202830188679245
8168011,5,B000MDH5JE,"I haven't worked out for at least a month due to various circumstances so I was looking for a way to get back into exercising with DVDs. This looked like it would be a good all over body workout and it was. I also could appreciate that it was fun and creative. You can either do all the exercises with a band or two small weights. I used three-pound weights and that worked great.

There are four segments to this workout. First there is a lovely warm up section that takes a few minutes and really seemed effective to warm up the muscles. Next there was a core workout to strengthen the midsection and the shoulders and hips. This was followed by a ballet workout which makes you feel a bit like a dancer doing exercises like you'd see on a Pilates workout. Then finally there is a nice cool down stretch segment.

I found the twists and balancing challenges fun to do. I had to modify some of the things. Laying flat on my stomach to do some of the exercises was slightly uncomfortable. The starfish exercise was challenging. But I could do most of the exercises with no real problems. So I'd say this is good for beginners or intermediates.

The instruction was precise and careful. The instructor made absolutely no mistakes and was very pleasant to listen to. I also liked her segment on how to look 5 pounds thinner through posture realignment.

So if you are looking for a fun and creative all over body workout this may interest you. I rented it first but will probably buy it as I could feel it was toning all over and didn't make my back hurt.

8168012,5,B000MDH5JE,Lara did it again. One of my favorite pilates dvds!!!,1406332800,,53,4.4
8168013,4,B000MDH5JE,Like Lara Hudson a lot.  Her cueing and voice is just like an instructor at the gym.  I felt the movements when adding the band.,1394668800,,128,4.08
8168014,5,B000MDH5JE,"This is a good DVD. I'd originally gotten at the library. It shows different levels simutaneously, so you can follow the person at your level.",1359849600,,142,4.72
8168015,3,B000MDH5JE,"I recently came across this DVD at a used book sale.  I've been trying to add more Pilates workouts into my fitness schedule, and shorter routines particularly appeal to me, so this Prevention offering seemed to be what I wanted.  According to the DVD cover, this was a ""Dance & Pilates Kit"" (I assume the ""Kit"" referred to the inclusion of the band, which I did not receive because I purchased my copy used) which would target both my abs and my entire body.  It contained two routines, ""Pilates Core"" and ""Ballet Core.""  Since I enjoy both of these workout styles, I decided to purchase the DVD.

In the short Introduction by instruction Lara Hudson, she describes this DVD as being a blend of Pilates and dance (I assume that by ""dance"" she meant ""ballet""--there is no other type of dance on the DVD).  On the Main Menu, I was surprised to find that in addition to the options for the Pilates Core Workout and the Ballet Core Workout, there were separate selections for both a Warm-Up (6 minutes) and a Cool-Down (6.5 minutes).  This seemed like a waste of time to me:  the workouts themselves are relatively short (just over 15 minutes), so if you were to do both the Warm-Up and the Cool-Down, you'd be almost DOUBLING the length of the workout!  Plus (as I'll discuss in great detail below), these routines are not very intense AT ALL and thus have no need of an independent warm-up and cool-down.

I've described each segment in great detail below.

*WARM-UP* (6 minutes)
Hudson teaches the workout live with two background exercisers, Kelly and Catherine, who shows modifications.  The warm-up is performed standing and begins with roll-downs.  Hudson then moves into a series of shoulder, elbow, and arm rolls in both directions.  She also performs plies with arm movements, an inner thigh stretch to a runner's lunge, and finishes with a body swing.

*PILATES CORE WORKOUT* (17 minutes)
This routine is performed entirely on the floor, as it consists of traditional Pilates matwork.  Hudson and Catherine use the band, whereas Kelly uses light hand weights (Hudson recommends 1-3 lbs.).  For EVERY move, Hudson first talks about how to set up with the band, then how to modify with the hand weights; this takes time and gets rather tedious.  The moves here include the hundred, a lying version of the spine twist, a version of the double leg stretch called the double leg x, the single leg circle, scissor, seated spine twist with tricep and single leg extension, side leg series, starfish extension, and, on the stomach: side arm extensions and breast stroke.  I found many of the moves VERY awkward to execute with the band; I did like the routine a bit better when I tried it with the weights.

*BALLET CORE WORKOUT* (18 minutes)
This routine is performed standing, again using the band or light weights.  Most of the moves were more similar to the Pilates standing series than ballet.  The exercises include plie with hug-a-tree arms, demi plie with arm extension, standing spine twist with leg extension, lunge with biceps, reach forward toes back, tricep presses, squat twist, helicopter, quad extension, diagonal reach, rear lift, swan stretch, and sunrise stretch.  Overall, this segment felt too easy to be effective.

*COOL-DOWN* (6.5 minutes)
Again, a ""cool-down"" seems completely unnecessary for a non-aerobic, fairly easy workout; to call this segment a ""stretch"" might have been somewhat more appropriate, as that's basically what Hudson does here.  She begins lying on the back for bridge pose with arm circles, then moves into a Figure 4 stretch.  She comes onto hands and knees for some cat/cow stretches, eventually making her way back to standing for an ""around the world"" stretch.

I agree with my fellow Amazon reviewer ""dnk""--at best, the routines on this DVD are probably appropriate for someone at an advanced beginner level.  I have been doing Pilates for years and am intermediate to advanced, and this DVD was MUCH too easy for me.  When I tried using dumbbells for the first routine (I actually used 5 lbs.), that was a little better, but overall, I still did not enjoy the workout.  Perhaps this DVD would appeal to an older audience (is that the goal of Prevention Systems?), but I'm in my mid-40s and didn't like it, so I can't recommend it.  My final rating would actually be closer to 2 1/2 stars.",1350086400,2,4340,4.824324324324325
8168016,5,B000MDH5JE,"I LOVE this DVD!
 The instructor uses a stretch band for the exercises.  She is flanked by 2 participants, one who is modifying her moves to use hand weights (more  difficult), and the other particpant is modifying moves for a less strenous workout. I love this.
The instructor uses a 6"" wide, 6 ft. long yellow band.  I bought one of these and it's perfect for a beginner like me. I love using the band because it's gentler on the joints and I'm 58 yrs old.  The DVD has ""new"" exercises that I've never seen before ( that's always a good thing) and it gives me a good workout. As I get more comfortable ( too comfortable?) with the yellow band, I will buy  the next color ""up"" so I can increase my workout with the more intense band.
I highly recommend this video.",1312156800,4,765,4.277777777777778
8168017,5,B000MDH5JE,"I buy a lot of workout videos and I can't tell you how many sit on the shelf b/c after one or two times, they just bore me to death.  I think I have every video Lara Hudson made.  She is so NOT annoying.  She's easy to follow and I actually look forward to doing the workouts.  This particular video is good for beginners, intermediates and advanced!  You can feel the burn the next day so I know I'm getting a good workout! (Just remember to rotate your workouts, so you keep ""feeling the burn"")",1302652800,3,496,4.178947368421053
8168018,3,B000MDH5JE,"I think that this video would be excellent for anyone just getting started into a workout routine.  As always, Lara Hudson is an excellent instructor.  She is one of the few workout instructors I have witnessed in 15 or so years of doing aerobics, yoga, and pilates whose manner is pleasant and positive without being overbearing and maniacal.  It's amazing how much the bearing of the instructor influences the whole experience.  That having been said, I would have appreciated a bit more to this workout.  Most of the movements in it are no different from ones I have seen her use in other DVD's, and the addition of the resistance band (a potentially awesome boost to the intensity of the workout) loses something in the execution.  I also feel that the routine here is a bit short, but as I said first off: for a beginner this would be excellent.",1299283200,,850,4.633333333333334
