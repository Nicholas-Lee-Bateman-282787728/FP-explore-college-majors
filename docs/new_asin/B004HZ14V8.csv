8429759,5,B004HZ14V8,"I was on a 4 to 12 shift at brain numbing job,early 1976 & ""Natural Thing"" comes on the radio and I am hooked. Sorry to say I never got the chance to see him live, but what a catalog of work. Dave Marsh in his review of 1978's ""Down In The Bunker"", makes a comparison of Gibbons to Bob Seger (who had finally broken through with the LP ""Night Moves""), that later reviewers referenced. But what Marsh meant in the comparison was that he saw Gibbons possibly being a lost treasure & the pity of that. No musical comparison at all, just his place in rock & roll.

And it is a shame that Steve Gibbons is only appreciated by a lucky few & their friends that will listen.

Until now all I had was a 1978 Musikladen Show that I fell onto. I'm flipping channels in the early 80's & on a DC PBS station (WHUT) is Steve Gibbons on German TV. Popped in a vhs tape, and I felt like I had broken some code, intercepted a beacon from Mars. Some things can't be explained.

This DVD is from the ""Saints & Sinners"" tour. The quality of video & sound is better than my vhs, but not much.

The man is incredible. A very witty and intuitive song writer, who references classic rock without being a poser. Marsh's reference would have been more appropriate with Springsteen.

An outstanding singer, a blend of Dylan & Marty Balin (listen to ""Please Don't Say Goodbye"" on ""Still Rollin' On""  and a charismatic performer.

He should've been a star, what happened?

If you're reading this, your a Steve Gibbons fan, get the DVD.

Play it for your friends who listen.",1316736000,4,1544,4.314878892733564
