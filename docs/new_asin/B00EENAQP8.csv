8604798,5,B00EENAQP8,This is the one that has the 2nd half of the first date.  Volume 16 left us hanging with the 1st half of the first date.  Everything changed for both Maya and Ser Chief.  A lot of drama as they both deal with all that comes between a single father and a younger woman plus the fact that the man was the former employer.  Good episodes and a must have.,1377388800,,351,3.9714285714285715
