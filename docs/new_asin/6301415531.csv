This video series has been an invaluable asset as we began with those early ""fixer-uppers"" to wanting more ""style on a budget."" We have sold each home for a nice profit using the knowledge gained in these videos. I just wish they would remake the series on DVD. If buying a used copy make sure it still has the original project sheet that came with each video. These are great planning tools and make it all so easy. Caution, do not loan these to friends, you probably will not get it back and then you'll be like me trying to track down another copy for yourself.",1250985600,,650,4.25
