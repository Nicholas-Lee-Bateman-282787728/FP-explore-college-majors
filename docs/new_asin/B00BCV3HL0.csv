5579706,5,B00BCV3HL0,Steven Hawking is legendary and our world has taken on a whole new meaning from his brilliance. There is no one else like him.,1393804800,6,126,4.291666666666667
5579707,5,B00BCV3HL0,"A good history of this amazing individual. A lesson in what's possible, at any intellectual level.
A good purchase, for any age.",1393718400,,128,4.863636363636363
5579708,5,B00BCV3HL0,"I had been hoping for a chronicle of Hawking's life, while he was still alive, so that you could rely on its honesty.  This did not disappoint.  Poignant, modest, self deprecating, consistent.  I wish the media had been available when Einstein was alive for there to have been a similar documentary about him.  We're fortunate to not only have benefited from Hawking's discoveries but also his ability to inspire others, particularly non scientists, to imagine and think about the beauty that is the universe, and life itself.",1393718400,14,526,5.011494252873563
5579709,5,B00BCV3HL0,"I used to watch Carl Sagan's show ""Cosmos"" all of the time when I was a kid.  I loved that show.  You knew that Mr. Sagan truly understood his subject as he was able to explain things in simple ways to ""simple"" people.  If you hear someone only speak in complex terms, or in particular, if you hear that same someone only recycle what's been said or written before, you can almost guarantee that he doesn't truly understand his own subject matter.  (I believe that Microsoft HR people train employees to interview with this idea in mind, by the way.  Force a candidate into breaking things down to basics.)

At least once, but surely more times than that, Mr. Sagan was asked about his opinion on religion.  His response?  ""Well, atheists must know more than I know.""  What he meant was:  ""It is just as foolish to say that God does not exist than it is to say that He definitely does.""  This is because it is impossible to prove either way.  It is also impossible to know for sure Mr. Sagan's own personal beliefs -- his widow argued after his death that he was an atheist, mostly to appease the scientific community, but he was almost surely an agnostic (he implied it by definition himself!) -- not that it really mattered.  What mattered was:  he was a very logical guy.

And then Stephen Hawking came along and said something like, ""You don't need God to create the Universe.""  Now, this statement was completely taken out of context logically by the masses.  Mr. Hawking did not imply, ""God does not exist,"" but rather I believe, ""It is still possible to prove that, even if God doesn't exist, the Universe still could have been created.  Furthermore, we could be in our current state without a Creator.""  This is a huge distinction, even ""huger"" than the Universe perhaps itself.  This counters the invalid arguments made by the Intelligent Design crowd, and I won't even bother justifying them with a rebuttal.  (OK.  I'll give you one:  it's at least a bit circular.)

But this got Mr. Hawking into trouble, probably with the religious crowd.  But surprisingly, he explains here -- in this really well-done documentary/biography film about his life -- how he ironically got himself into trouble with the scientists when he argued for the Big Bang Theory (BBT).  They wanted no part of it; to them, talking about a BBT implied creation which implied God.  (It just goes to show you:  scientists can be as illogical as the religious.)  But Mr. Hawking struggled on, and while it is difficult to prove that the BBT is completely correct, people have warmed up to it.  Even the scientific community.  Perhaps even some from the religious crowd.

I really liked this film as it comes from a first-person perspective from Mr. Hawking, which gives it a very authentic feel.  Furthermore, this film isn't just about Physics; it's mostly about his own personal life and his own personal struggles.  I will say that I've been on the fence with the whole Stephen-Hawking-is-the-greatest-man-in-the-Universe idea for a long time, as I believe that many people only say this because he's in a wheel chair.  Perhaps they want to feel better about themselves for supporting someone with a disability?  I say that this is an insult to Mr. Hawking; while you shouldn't ""worship"" him -- he doesn't seem much into that and feels uncomfortable with ""fame,"" as he sighs about this at one point during the film -- you should admire him simply because he's done some impressive work in his life.

I think that if Mr. Sagan were alive today, he might say, ""There are billions and billions of people on earth.  I think that they all should admire Mr. Hawking as a scientist, not as a guy in a wheelchair.""  And I would wholeheartedly agree.",1392336000,15,3724,4.688271604938271
5579710,5,B00BCV3HL0,"Good biography, much of it narrated by the man himself.

5579716,4,B00BCV3HL0,"This is a well-done documentary of Stephen Hawking's life, both personal and professional, with much of his story reported in his own words.  It's not a particularly uplifting story, but those who suffer life-changing illnesses such as his ALS, don't leave observers exhilarated.  Having not seen The Theory of Everything, I found the 2012 documentary very interesting, although it did leave me sad and somewhat depressed that such a brilliant man has suffered so much for so many years.  I certainly recommend it be viewed and would have given it a 5-star rating if not for the sadness revealed.  Personally, I missed that his children weren't interviewed for the film.",1463270400,,670,5.0636363636363635

Underscores that a lot of people have it much worse - an important element to fight depression and self pity that easily result from tragic health conditions. Sad to hear though that a man so ill-fated does not believe in God, or life after death. Yet amazing that given that, his will to live and experience life in any way he can testifies to the power of will to live.

5579761,5,B00BCV3HL0,"Another look at the life story of Stephen Hawking, who has become an icon in physics and mathematics.  Using his own words (possibly from his autobiography) to narrate the story, it reveals a lot about his personality that has not been known before.  While being taken care of by his devoted wife for many, many years, he appears to be insensitive to her personal needs.  It was fascinating how much attention and financial support he received from the media, Cambridge U., Silicon Valley titans, and as a result became a celebrity.  While I can sympathize with him because of his physical problems and how he was able to overcome them, the film gave me reason to believe he is a very selfish person who did not develop emotionally.  Now I'm anxious to see ""The Theory of Everything"" which, I believe, is based on his wife's side of the story.",1433808000,2,843,4.630872483221476

My son felt different than I do because he does not believe in Hawkings findings about black holes, etc.  But for me, I was more captivated with Hawkings determination to make the most of his life because he believes this IS IT.  Not believing in an after-life certainly changes the value one might put on actual living in the moment and appreciating everything experienced NOW.  A good watch regardless of your beliefs.",1432944000,3,571,4.67

Some students are trapped within their own bodies.  Some have physical problems that prevent them from communicating normally. What helps is love, respect and support.

You don't get any sense of warmth regarding his own children, just that he had them.  It was a ME account without any of the perspectives of those in his personal life outside of the world of Physics.  It seems his whole life story was about his struggles with ALS and how it affected his professional life when in fact, Hawking shows no real humanity except to say he had a quick witted sense of humor and that he fell in love with a woman twice enough to marry but clearly they divorced him because they finally realized there was only his take in the relationship in the final analysis.  Sad, his children probably saw him more as machine that had a need to continue to live and less able to give much back.  The times you saw him at play, there was no sense of parental love that would show Hawking as more dimensional, if such dimensions of his personality actual exists.  On the other hand, I certainly wouldn't want to live with his physical burdens and go through more than half a century with that to carry on a daily basis.",1426723200,3,1323,4.401639344262295

""My name is Stephen Hawking.  For the past fifty years, I have travelled the world studying and lecturing about time and space.  This film is a personal journey through my life, told in my own words.  Come with me and I will tell you the story of how I became who I am.""

The above is found at the beginning of this extraordinary autobiographical documentary about the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking.  (He ""was born in 1942, exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo."")

I personally have read quite a bit on Hawking but what made this film special to me was that:

(1) It was entirely narrated by Stephen Hawking.
(2) Brief comments were made by such people as his siblings, care giver, school friends, university friends, professors, software experts, biographers, his first wife, physicists (like Roger Penrose, Kip Thorne), and his present and former students.
(3) We actually get to see Hawking in his natural environment and get to actually see the people mentioned in (2) above.

We also learn about his science (""I was writing the rule book for black holes"") and the progression of his devastating illness whose spectre is always present.

We also get to see the good and the bad of worldwide celebrity.

Finally, this documentary had an ""intimate feel"" for me, as if Hawking were talking directly to me.

In conclusion, I feel this is an incredible documentary narrated by a determined scientist who has a strong will to live.  In fact, at the end of the documentary he tells us:

""I'm not afraid of dying, but I'm in no hurry to die.""

5580095,3,B00BCV3HL0,"Theres a biographical film about Hawking in which Benedict Cumberbatch plays the young Stephen.  This is not that film.  This is composed from interviews with Mr. Hawking, his ex-wives, and earlier video material.
Though it is all true, it left me feeling I had missed all the best stuff.  Hardly a word of explanation about the importance of his theoretical work [only repeated assertions of how hes the worlds greatest living genius, which Im not fully sure is true], nor any attempt to connect his intellectual work with his personal challenges.  So in the end its almost like watching a biography of a disabled guy who for unknown reasons became famous, almost like the woman in the Wheres the Beef commercial, or the Taco Bell dog.  In short, to me it seemed lacking in the proper context.  Interested in Hawking?  Maybe, read A Brief History of Time instead.  I give it a C-.  Maybe the Cumberbatch film is better?",1408147200,3,920,4.735849056603773

He was honest about his two marriages and his two children, and his own debilitating evolution, and how he became so famous.  It was not a movie about his formulas or his mathematics or his big bang theory or his black holes; it was simply about his life.  A very inspiring man who documented himself up until his age of 71 when they thought he was going to die when he was in his 20s.  The man lives on, and his legacy remains even though he has reached the point in his life when he can hardly move his cheeks.  An amazing man who lives to think.
