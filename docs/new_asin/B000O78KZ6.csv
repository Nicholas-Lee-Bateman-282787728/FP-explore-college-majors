2792401,5,B000O78KZ6,"Twentieth Century Fox has gone all out in presenting these two restored films. Along with the two black and white films are two featurettes on Wodehouse. The slipcased jacket includes notes and four postcards of the theatrical lobby cards, with the films on one double- sided disc. Wodehouse fans will rejoice in this unprecedented opportunity to view these two little- seen movies. But how will they play for everyone else?

Quite well, as it turns out. Despite the title, Thank You, Jeeves has almost nothing in common with the 1934 novel, but it introduces David Niven as Bertie Wooster in his first feature film role. Whether or not he's believable as Bertie, he does a very good David Niven. Which was somewhat the problem. Daryl Zanuck borrowed him from Samuel Goldwyn  for the film, which rocketed Niven to stardom, ensuring his nonavailability for future Wooster roles. Which made this film essentially a one- off.

Even if you'd scarcely heard of Jeeves, Arthur Treacher was already well- known for playing British butlers, so it was a mere step to a valet. For the same reason, he lacks the nuanced sense that Stephen Fry would later bring to Wooster and Jeeves. Step Lively, Jeeves takes nothing from Wodehouse's books, not even Bertie Wooster. That's of course because of the typically Wodehousian mix-up explained above so that David Niven was not available. However, Jeeves almost plays a Wooster without a Jeeves to extricate him from the soup. Given a free hand, Arthur Treacher shows himself a quite good actor. However, veering from the stereotypical butler is also in keeping with some of Jeeve's many sides as revealed in later novels. So odd as it may seem, Step Lively, Jeeves comes off as the better picture.

The two extras, ""Thank You P.G.: The Life of P.G. Wodehouse"", and ""The World of Wodehouse"" are both very recent and seem like two parts of the same documentary (which they probably were). How recent are they? So recent that all the books shown are the Overstreet hardback Collector's Wodehouse editions. That said, the documentaries are extremely good, consisting entirely of interview footage with members of the Wodehouse Society, authors, and actors. Having seen and heard Robert McCrum made me want to read his Wodehouse bio. Someone gives a shocking statistic, that 95 per cent of Woosters were killed in WW I, which throws a whole new light on Wodehouse's attempt to recreate a bygone Britain.

One difference between Bertie in the books and on film is that he narrates the books, as it were, while the film is in the standard Hollywood third person. Niven nevertheless has some brilliant Woosterian monologues. Step Lively, however, wins with a Wodehousian plot and, something nearly forgotten in modern day Tinseltown, very strong minor characters. This enables the film to use a very small roster of personnel, which yet seems like a cast of thousands. While the slightly better known 1937 Fred Astaire- Burns and Allen musical of A Damsel in Distress is lively and engaging, mostly due to the stellar cast, both of these films seem closer to the spirit of Wodehouse.",1181952000,22,3109,4.948275862068965
2792402,1,B000O78KZ6,"It is possible that these are the only talking Bertie and Jeeves movies in which PG Wodehouse may have had a direct role. That said These are a singularly bad pair movies. The only audience I would condemn to see these  movies are the movie producers who think the way to make money is to seize upon a proven formula and refuse to believe that there's any need to keep any loyalty towards the original formula. Movie producers with no faith in the original story need to find a different story. For what it's worth of the Rotten Tomato ratings for these two movies are 6.3 and 6.1 respectively

A little background on this two DVD set. When the decision was made to film to movies David Niven who would play Bertie Wooster was under contract to a competing movie company and it was made clear his loaner was for one movie only. Therefore the first side Thank You Jeeves has the two-man comedy team but the second movie Step Lively Jeeves has no Bertie Wooster.

Author Treacher was an excellent choice for the character of Jeeves. With the right script in the right direction he could've carried both movies quite well. As it is he is allowed a few bits in the second movie wherein we can see Treatures acting skill in this type of character. I suspect David Niven could have been an excellent Bertie Wooster unfortunately the script gives him very little chance to be the spluttering fool of the books. Instead of we have Niven playing the kind of debonaire womanizer that David Niven is fully capable of performing but bears little resemblance to the confused alternately romantic and semi-misogynistic Bertie Wooster.

Meantime the two scripts give us a Jeeves who is not especially bright who does not see through thin plots and unlikely coincidences. Jeeves a gentleman's gentleman in all situations would not find himself laying on the floor leg wrestling or directing a saxophone solo March number. This Jeeves neither shimmers nor thinks up elaborate ways to save his employer while manipulating all else around him. Instead of being the straight man of all straight men this Jeeves is a stiffly comedic figure.

The real shame is that the plot throws altogether too many devices: spies, romantic leads social climbing gangsters and even a stereotypical black jazz musician, Willie best in the role of course named Drowsy. Woodhouse was quite capable of having complicated plots while drafting various oddball side issues. But the secret to his comedy was keeping everything tight and everything to the purpose. He was consciously creating a fairy story and keeping the complexities with in the comedic nature of his leading characters. These two movies simply pile up complexities as if the the director had to fold in whatever actors and plot lines happen to be laying around otherwise unattended.

2792408,5,B000O78KZ6,"Arthur Treacher did a number of ""Jeeves"" movies, and played the character very close to the one described in the books by P.G. Wodehouse.  At of this minute, these are the only two movies available on DVD.  While it's certainly handy to have them on one DVD, I wish there were more movies available.

If you're a fan of the Jeeves and Wooster series by the BBC, Hugh Laurie is the best representation of the Bertie Wooster character.  Both the TV series and the ""Jeeves"" movies have some merits and some demerits.  There isn't yet a complete capture of P.G. Wodehouse's novels.

I definitely recommend reading the originals!",1303948800,2,624,4.731481481481482
2792409,1,B000O78KZ6,"Why have these films been marketed on DVD?  They attempt to coast on the popularity of the 1990s Stephen Fry / Hugh Laurie series, Jeeves and Wooster, rather than the intrinsic quality of these relics, and anyone buying this DVD will be sorely disappointed by the comparison.
 At the end of 1935, 20th Century-Fox bought the film rights to Jeeves, looking for potentially prolific--and profitable--properties, and any character who seemed to have the potential to lure filmgoers to film after film.  The series seems to have been launched on what was perceived as a sure bet, casting Arthur Treacher, known for playing butler roles, as the most famous literary gentleman's gentleman.
 However, the Jeeves films revealed no sense of the situations and character patterns that had made him successful in and books.  There is none of Jeeves's trademark Machiavellian cleverness in the Treacher characterization, simply an annoyingly starched and stuffy, standard-issue English butler.  He is irritable and petulant, appalled by any breach of etiquette or improper behavior, lacking the adaptability of the Wodehouse creation.  Wodehouse himself said that Treacher ""pulled faces all the time.  Awful,"" adding ""That supercilious manner of his is all wrong for Jeeves.""
 There was scarcely a mistake that was not made in the 56 minute opening movie, THANK YOU, JEEVES.  In dispensing with the plot of the novel, and any other Jeeves story, the screenwriters substituted a bizarre combination of incidents interspersed in an incredibly unlikely account of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves becoming involved with espionage.  The attempts at humor were either forced, or, in the case of a few lines that might have been amusing, were presented in such a way so as to conceal any comedic potential.  Racial comedy with Willie Best, typical of the time, only makes viewers cringe today.
 David Niven made an acceptable Bertie, effectively capturing his comic perplexity, but he was then under contract to Samuel Goldwyn, who typically loaned Niven out only for a single picture.  Hence, the script of THANK YOU, JEEVES married Bertie at the close, eliminating half of the Wodehouse team in adapting the stories to the screen, judging Bertie to be dispensable.
 THANK YOU, JEEVES, a 1936 release, was followed the next year by STEP LIVELY, JEEVES, which this time is not ostensibly based on any Wodehouse work, but admits to being an original creation.  The first picture in the series had been so bad that ironically there was nowhere to go but up.  Although STEP LIVELY, JEEVES is a screwball comedy far from the Wodehouse tone, it at least remains predominantly humorous, unlike the mix with spies that had marred THANK YOU, JEEVES.
 There is no consistency in characterization between the two movies.  The 69 minute STEP LIVELY, JEEVES reflects a new concept of the whole idea of a Jeeves series.  Jeeves now has the Bertie Wooster brain, perpetually befuddled and confused.  Yet the result is a pleasant, if thoroughly undistinguished movie that does contain a few mild, brief laughs--modest achievements, but significant improvements over THANK YOU, JEEVES.  However, STEP LIVELY, JEEVES was still far from the necessary quality to sustain a series, and it was canceled at 20th Century-Fox over the summer of 1937.  (Simultaneously, Wodehouse was scripting his own novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS at RKO, a vastly superior rendering of his comedy to the screen.)
 American audiences were likely regarded as unlikely to accept a series positing a truly sagacious English butler, as in the Wodehouse stories, instead seeing such a figure purely as a source of comedy, meaning that the rights to Jeeves were bought for the name only, not the narratives.  As it happened however, the Jeeves series became one of the worst executed ideas under Sol Wurtzel's Fox ""B"" unit, one which fully justified the aphorism about Fox ""Bs"", ""from bad to Wurtzel.""  Probably the ultimate epitaph occurred when, in a 1937 radio broadcast, Hedda Hopper interviewed P.G. Wodehouse, and they spoke as if the Fox Jeeves movies had never been made.
 Ironically, both Treacher and Niven starred separately in later television films of Wodehouse stories, Treacher in The Philco Television Playhouse:  Uncle Dynamite (1950) and Niven in two versions of ""Uncle Fred Flits By"" for Hollywood Opening Night (1953) and Four Star Playhouse (1955).  Of these three, at least the latter survives, and is one of  the most successful transpositions of Wodehouse.  Niven produced this half-hour show that fully captures the zaniness of the original while maintaining fidelity to the source.  This example of one of the same actors in a worthwhile adaptation would have offered an interesting comparison to give real value to this DVD, proving the possibility of bringing Wodehouse successfully to the screen in a manner that put the Fox Jeeves films to shame.
 The DVD bonuses, two documentaries about Wodehouse, are well-done but not sufficiently memorable for most viewers to justify the purchase.  Some idea of the lack of thought given to the overall production of this package is that the documentaries, and the accompanying DVD brochure, give entirely divergent and contradictory accounts of the making of the movies.
 The point of buying a video is to enable the purchaser to enjoy a work of quality again and again, like a favorite book.  I doubt few who buy this DVD will ever look at it again, assuming, of course, they manage to watch it all the way through at all.  Instead, the purchaser is better advised to spend on videos of WODEHOUSE PLAYHOUSE, JEEVES AND WOOSTER, or A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.",1200700800,30,5648,5.113289760348584
2792410,1,B000O78KZ6,"If you are familiar with the excellent adaptions of the Jeeves and Wooster novels in the recent series, featuring Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, you will be sorely disappointed with these feature films. The problem with the adaptation of ""Thank you, Jeeves!"" is that it revolves entirely around the plot and backgrounds the characters. Wodehouse's plots are never the primary interest (they are all pretty similar--Bertie hatches plan, plan is ill-fated, Jeeves bails him out, Bertie and/or his friends are saved, but Bertie's ego is tarnished.). For example, ""Thank you, Jeeves!"" wastes several minutes on a car chase and a fight scene. Instead, the focus should be on Wodehouse's memorable characters (and yes, as the last reviewer observed, the Stepin Fetchit character, whom Niven refers to as ""it,"" is unforgivable).

The second story, which features a Russian character with a horrible fake accent, is only slightly better and is not by Wodehouse! Terrible disappointment. I'm kind of glad that Niven never made another Jeeves and Wooster movie and thus prematurely ended what likely would have been a series of movies--such masterfully written stories deserve better.

2792411,3,B000O78KZ6,"Of the two films in the package you would think the better of the two would be the film actually based on a P.G. Woodhouse story and not the one without a basis in Woodhouse's work.  You would think.  ""Thank You, Jeeves!"" employs Arthur Treacher and David Niven as Jeeves and Bertie and they are ideal in their roles.  Too bad their saddled with a lame espionage story that leaves you with little interest.  What negates the film completely is it contains a Stepin Fetchit type that would offend any sensibility.  This character left such a bad taste in my mouth that it made whatever few redeeming qualities the film had negligible.  ""Step Lively, Jeeves!"", however more than makes up for the wit that was lacking in it's predecessor.  The engaging premise here is that Jeeves is ensnared by two second-rate confidence men who convince him he's an heir to Sir Francis Drake.  They go to America for a pyramid scheme where they hook up with a ""reformed"" gangster and his socially ambitious spouse.

I was expecting Bertie and Jeeves to be portrayed considerably differently than the way they were, and I was hoping Aunt Agatha would make an appearance, but she didn't.

8183752,4,B000O78KZ6,"what Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are to mystery, P.G. Wodehouse's passionate but ditzy man-about-town Bertie Wooster and his unflappable manservant/guardian angel Jeeves are to that frantic subgenre of comedy known as ""farce."" nowhere else in literature, it seems, can be found another duo to so aptly represent what farce is all about and how it works. nor in film, as anyone who knows the names Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie can readily attest.
but of course the definitive depiction isn't necessarily the first. there was George Reeves before Christopher Reeve, for instance, and William Hartnell before Jon Pertwee and/or Tom Baker and/or David Tennant. similarly, Fry's kindly (if Machiavellian) Jeeves and Laurie's giddy Wooster were predated (WAY predated) by these fun but decidedly less faithful adaptations.
Jeeves is played by one Arthur Treacher, who ended up specializing in such manservant characters. for this reason, he's often erroneously cited as having made a career of playing Jeeves, despite having done so on only these two occasions.
Wooster, for his part, served to introduce the film enthusiasts of the world (and/or ages) to one David Niven. he would of course become one of the screen's most lasting luminaries, still household enough a name to headline Around The World In 80 Days and The Pink Panther decades later. but of course he had to start somewhere, and that's what's usually cited as the significance of the film Thank You Jeeves!
Treacher and Niven are nothing Fry and Laurie wouldn't be, but they have a similar chemistry. one critic even whimsically surmised that Wodehouse must've earmarked them at their births for the roles. it is their virtuoso treatment of their roles that make the film's myriad imperfections forgivable.
the root of said imperfections is that it bears  little pure Wodehouse-ness beyond the relationship of the leads. the film is in fact a cornucopia (thought some might prefer the term hodgepodge) of elements that would shortly become familiar B-movie cliches. the major thrust of the plot is that Wooster attempts to gallantly come to a woman's aid, but she turns out to be less damsel in distress than femme fatale, and so gets him mixed up with spies seeking a set of blueprints. the climax is a slapstick chase through a supposedly haunted dungeon. oh yes, and in spite of the duplicity with which she's treated him, love conquers all.
most scandalous is the addition of a a comic-relief negro stereotype, played by one Willie Best. the character's defining trait is his laziness, to the extent that he's named Drowsy. Best is straight out of the Stepin Fetchet school of acting. (he even looks a little, and sounds a lot, like Lincoln Perry.) well, as has been said before and will have to be said again many times, you'll have to put this in the context of a time when it wasn't a particular heresy. forgive them, for they knew not what they were doing.
just how much does it correlate with Wodehouse's work? let em out it this way: he complained in a letter to a friend about them not using ""a word of my story,"" favoring instead the work of ""some studio hack."" still, Jeeves is precisely the obsequious caretaker, and Wooster exactly the well-meaning bumbler, that P.G. had in mind. so whatever they might've gotten wrong, they did get the most important thing right.
if the first film feels a little off, though, the second and final installment, Step Lively Jeeves!, is bizarre enough to be an episode of The Twilight Zone. as it happens, David Niven was under contract to Samuel Goldwyn and had been ""loaned out"" to 20th Century Fox. now that Niven's star was rising, Goldwyn was less willing to so lightly lend his services to a rival studio. so in a way, the first film is not unlike a ""pilot"" for a tv series that doesn't get picked up.
the usual practice in such a case is to simply recast, but Fox apparently had their doubts. most likely because chemistry is something you pretty much luck out with. it can't be designed or manufactured. it's pretty much either there or it's not. and it was there to such a degree between Treacher and Niven that the odds were perceptibly against recapturing that lightning with someone else.
it might also of had something to do with the fact that it could be argued Jeeves was the true star of the stories.
however they justified it to themselves, Jeeves set out on his own. Jeeves, so two conartists claim, is the last living descendant of Sir Francis Drake, and therefore has a fortune waiting for him in America. (it is never explained why the legacy of a British statesman can't be claimed right there in London.) so basically, in this film he becomes an awkward amalgam of the two characters, nearly falling for precisely the sort of scam he's generally seen protecting or extracting Wooster from.
also odd: his nae is given here as Rupert Badgewick Jeeves. according to Wodehouse, his first name is Reginald.
technically speaking, Jeeves is a supporting character here. the true stars are the swindlers, played by Alan Dinehart and George Givot as a sort of de facto Abbott & Costello-type team. not that Jeeves doesn't have his moments, particularly opposite one Helen Flint as a social climber hoping that Jeeves - or rather, the nobleman he's being passed off as - can get her into Society. but even so it's Dinehart and Givot who steal the show.
still, like the first film, this one makes up for it's drawbacks with liberal doses of Golden Age Of Hollywood charm.
in a nutshell, these films are not for the Wodehouse purist, but the mere Wodehouse fan is bound to enjoy, well, bits and pieces at least.",1475712000,,5632,4.806185567010309

Nevertheless, there is something strangely fascinating about how bad the movie is, sort of like watching Plan Nine from Outer Space. A mildly amusing battle scene in the dungeon of a country inn is the only glimmer we see of Jeeves' ability to pull his master out of the soup. The plot had nothing to do with Jeeves and Wooster, who seem to have wandered in from another set and were thus written into the story line the best that could be managed at short notice.

Further, you don't really want to watch this movie for the story line, because plot utterly fails in holding any interest. And it's totally unbelievable. Bertie, settling down and getting married? Indeed not, sir!

I was also astonished when a black swing saxophonist showed up in the English countryside, but not any more astonished than when Jeeves chided the man for playing his ""favorite song"" all wrong and stepped in to conduct! There is a bit of a history lesson in here, as the 1930s African American actor Willie Best was largely considered a very good actor of his time by fellow actors, although in this and many other films he appears as a fool; moreover, in his first films was credited under the derogatory name of ""Sleep 'n' Eat."" Mr. Best deserved much better treatment than this.

Read the other reviews for the back story of why David Niven appears in only the first of these two movies. I found the reviews very interesting and they added value to the time I spent watching such a mediocre movie.

If, for curiosity's sake, you wish to have a peek at one of the bad movies of the 1930s, cynically created to trade on the beloved stories of P.G.
