8155226,1,B000K9NSKK,"The first ten minutes of the film passed with only a slight sense of bias. At about the 30 minute mark it becomes apparent that you have fallen into some of the most tainted propaganda in ""documentary"" history.

I am neither Jewish, Zionist, or a liberal, but as a critically-minded scientist and researcher into history and religion, I find this film an atrocity.

Although it sights ""sources"", these are often merely fragments of much larger works and are not substantiated beyond resonable doubt.

I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for an ""unbiased"" opinion. Simply reiterating the phrase ""some say"" or ""Non-Jews assert"" does not make it objective.",1207008000,7,667,5.045454545454546
8155227,5,B000K9NSKK,"I find this DVD 100% based on facts. I can understand that if someone who is a zionist may say that this video is just another Anti-Jew or Anti-Semitic only because it tells the truth.

Through out the video, everything I saw was said with FACTS and Proof. I was shocked to see how Zionism is affecting USA and yet we don't even know it. One of the example is that we pay extra food tax just for 2% of Jews in US for their Kosher food.

This video is NOT against Jews since you will see opinions of American Jews in the DVD who appose Zionism and Israeli Jews simply call them betrayers.

I think this is a best dvd for christmass gift since Christmass is the time when you should give an eye-opener gifts.

Well made and I am ordering from Amazon even though I have seen this dvd at my friends house because this is something you will want to own.",1197676800,10,848,4.152439024390244

I finally watched a preview copy he sent around and am very impressed with its sincerity, professionalism, sensitivity and profundity.""
--Attorney Edgar Steele

""The video goes into good deal of depth on the issue of so-called anti-Semitism, and follows at a pace well suited to people new to the overall issue.  Understanding Anti-Semitism is an excellent way to introduce people to the Jewish question -- which I intend to do with friends and family very soon....""
--Matthew Spencer

""My wife and I just got a new DVD player, and one of the first things we watched was your DVD, 'Understanding Anti-Semitism.' We both thought it was quite good.  Your commentary was right on target.  What a ""colorful"" collection of images you compiled -- love it!""
--Harrell Rhome, Ph. D.

""Your DVD is incredible.  Every American needs to see this.  All we get here is propaganda. ... It was hard at times to watch your DVD.  So much unfairness, terror and heartbreak.  What can I do, personally, to help?  If anything?""
--Jean Christensen

""A very interesting and thought provoking DVD.  It is a shame that we don't get such honest views expressed in the media very often....  I think that we both know much of the reasons for that.  Please fight with all means at your disposal for your First Amendment rights.  There are many in your country and elsewhere who would be all to happy to see them abolished, or just stand by unconcerned.  As Edmund Burke said, 'All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing.'  Thanks again, the DVD arrived very swiftly....""
--Robert Jones

""Well, the folks I watched it with thought it was a smash hit.  In fact my girlfriend wants to order two of them to mail to friends.""
--John Kaminski

""Got your DVD late last week and couldn't wait to watch it that night. I had no problem playing it on my computer with PowerDVD. The DVD is extremely informative and I think you did a fantastic job of presenting and documenting a sensitive and difficult topic.  That DVD really needs to get out so that people have a better understanding of the extent of control exercised over this country and a more truthful perspective about European and Russian history.""
--Fred VanOlphen

""I was really impressed.... [A] very professional and creative [production].""

8155229,1,B000K9NSKK,"Don't be fooled by this coy masquerade.  This is NOT an objective documentary.  It is anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and Holocaust-denying propaganda.",1165449600,8,173,6.818181818181818
