4834350,3,B005M9VSLY,This Novela Is Nice & Everything I Love It But Theirs Nothing Like Watching It On Tv It Skips Way To Many Events Which Kind Of Sucks Becuase Then Now How You Can You Understand The Novela Better But Over All Its Nice I Just Recently Bought It ! I Just Wish That It Didn't Skip A Lot >.< But Yeah !,1334361600,6,297,3.806451612903226
4834351,4,B005M9VSLY,this twelve hours are enough to find out what the telenovela is talking about but i wished they have added more scenes to make it more interesting.,1333324800,,147,4.481481481481482
4834352,4,B005M9VSLY,"Well, I finally received the DVD. It's a 3-disc set with english subtitles. The good things are the quality of the video, and the sound, it was a pleasure watching it. The bad thing is yes, as other customers said, it's an edited version, and the story might be unclear for anyone watching this for the first time. I geuss they tried editing it, and make it as a one long ""movie"", and you don't really notice this before they start showing some flash backs, and one gets annoyed because of the editing in the middle of William-Maite scenes. All in all I don't regret buying it, it's a great, romantic (cheezy) telenovela with a hot onscreen-couple :D",1332028800,2,650,4.516949152542373
4834353,1,B005M9VSLY,This dvd does not show the complete series... I ordered it because I wanted to own the complete series that was originally shown on Tv but this skipped a lot would not be the proper word to use.. IT'S MISSING A LOT OF THE SERIES... DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! I NOW HAVE TO FIND THE 100% COMPLETE SERIES!!!! DO NOT ORDER!!! I AM NOT EXCRUCIATING... I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!,1331769600,13,381,4.232876712328767
4834354,3,B005M9VSLY,"Loved this series! Its a must to watch and have.
Excellent quality, vulome and everything.
But unfortunately, it doesn't contain all the episodes or scenes and that made me disappointment.",1331078400,,188,5.3
4834355,5,B005M9VSLY,i lovved this novela it was one of the best of the best william levy y maite perroni are good together they make this novela worth watching .. i watch it over and over so get it,1323561600,3,177,3.810810810810811
4834356,1,B005M9VSLY,"I was so excited to watch this new retelling of this story because of William Levy.  Sad to say his sexiness could not save this ""novela"".  It started off promising, but got horribly boring towards the middle, and just never picked up momentum.  All my cousins and aunts who also watched this ""novela"" agree.  If you want to see a better version of this same story, pick up ""El Privilegio de Amar"" which is available on DVD and stars Adela Noriega, who is 100 times a better actress than the girl who plays the main girl.  The caliber of actors is soooooo much better, and that story never lost my interest!

For those looking for a shirtless William Levy, you will not find him here either.  Pick up Sortilegio if you want to see more of his sexiness.",1322352000,3,752,4.405797101449275
4834357,4,B005M9VSLY,"Estoy Esperando con Muchas Ansias que llegue el 20 de Diciembre para Comprar este Dvd. Me Encanta William Levy y Maite Perroni, hacen una Exelente Pareja, y apesar de que esta Telenovela es un Remake de El Privilegio de Amar Me Gusto Mucho La Nueva Version.
El Triunfo del Amor tiene un Gran Elenco como la Sra Victoria Ruffo, la Gran Actriz Daniela Romo, Guillermo Garcia Cantu, Dominika Paleta, Osvaldo Rios, Diego Olivera, Monica Ayos, Erika Buenfil, Cesar Evora, Eduardo Santamarina, Pablo Monteros, Marco Mendez, Marck Tacher, entre otros...
Cuando Compre el Dvd, lo Tenga y lo Mire les cuento que tal esta el Resumen...
27/12/2011: Debo Reconocer que Esperaba Otra Cosa, un Resumen Mucho Mejor.
No esta el asesinato de Octavio Iturbide (Eduardo Santamarina), el esposo de Bernarda, tampoco se ve la escena en que Bernarda quema vivo a Gonzalo (Arturo Carmona) y a su esposa, Gonzalo era el verdadero pabre de su hijo Juan Pablo y quien fue el amante de Bernarda.
Desde el comienzo faltan todas las Escenas de Rodolfo Padilla/Salvador Pineda y Victoria, solo se ve en un Flashback cuando Rodolfo quiere violar a Victoria, en el que ella lo recuerda, nada mas, tambien faltan los chantajes que el le hace amenzandola con contarle a su flia su pasado, no esta su final, entre otras cosas.
Quitaron todo lo relacionado entre Guillermo y Osvaldo, sus rivalidades, la envidia de Guillermo hacia el por Leonela, por el teatro y su carrera como actor etc... No esta la escena en que Bernarda cita a Osvaldo y le cuenta todo sobre Victoria. Ni tampoco cuando Victoria se entera que Maria (Mariana Rios) es su supuesta hija.
No esta la muerte de Tomasa la empleada de Bernarda ni cuando entra Fausto a pedir trabajo a su casa y la descubre en el momento que Bernarda la asesino por haberle ido a decir a Victoria que ella habia matado a Octavio, su esposo. Tampoco se ve cuando Fausto decide ayudarla y quema el cuerpo de Tomasa en la estufa de la casa ni cuando Juan Pablo llega mas tarde y siente un olor raro y le pregunta a su madre que hizo, que que habia quemado. En el resumen Fausto aparece asi de la nada en una escena que Bernarda planea junto con el como destruir a Victoria, al igual que su tia Eva no se ve cuando ingresa a trabajar en el lugar de Tomasa.
No estan las Escenas de Eva/Pillar Pellicer, la tia de Fausto, cuando le prende fuego a la casa, cuando envenena a Bernarda ni cuando le pone gasolina para que se incendie su camioneta, todo lo referente entre Eva y Bernarda lo quitaron, solo se ve cuando Bernarda intenta huir en un avion privado y surge una falla y el avion se estrella. Deberian haber dejado esas escenas, bien o mal era uno de los castigos de Bernarda antes de su muerte.
El Accidente de Fernanda no esta, solo se ve cuando es internada en un hospital, ademas no aparece la muerte de Federico, su novio. Solo dejaran cuando Padilla le reclama a Victoria y su familia por la muerte de su hijo, no estan las escenas en que el corta los frenos del auto para que Fernanda se accidente.
No se ve cuando Osvaldo recibe un balazo y lo internan, solo esta la escena de cuando ya aparece internado y asi de la nada llega Leonela, la verdadera madre de Max y se presenta en el hospital.
Quitaron las escenas en que Bernarda se roba al hijo de Maria, cuando quema la vecindad, cuando manda a secuestrar a Maria y a Victoria, cuando Ximena se une a Bernarda en contra de Victoria porque ella la hecha al enterarse que el hijo que espera es de Guillermo, cosa que en el Dvd no se ve, solo cuando la corre, porque la escena en que Osvaldo se lo dice a Victoria no esta, tampoco cuando Bernarda se alia con Guillermo, luego con Padilla y Leonela, cuando Bernarda mata de un balazo al Alacran, no tiene la escena en que Bernarda le confiesa a Victoria que aos atras ella fue quien la atropello porque queria verla muerta, no se ve cuando Ximena atropella a Maria, solo cuando ella le comenta a su madre que lo hizo y que mato a Linda, no esta cuando Fausto le dice a Max que Ximena mato a Linda, ni cuando le dice a Maria que Bernarda mato a Tomasa al igual que a sus padres, no se ve el Final de Fausto, ni cuando Guillermo le hace tener el accidente a Osvaldo, ni el vinculo que mantiene Leonela con Guillermo, ni cuando Max intima a la complice de Bernarda en el secuestro de su hijo, y muchisimas cosas importantes de la Novela.
Del Final sacaron las escenas en que Ximena le roba el celular a Guillermo porque tiene un video donde muestra que ella mato a Linda y se da cuenta que el tiene un video en que se ve a el y a Bernarda implicados en el secuestro de Maria y Victoria, luego ella le da el video a su madre y se los muestra a Victoria y su flia y ahi descubren que Bernarda fue la autora del secuestro. No se ve cuando Eva se despide de Fausto en la carcel, ni tampoco cuando Ximena desmaya de un golpe a Leonela en su camerino, se viste como ella e intenta asesinar a Guillermo con la daga en la obra ni la escena en que despues Ximena va a buscar a Guillermo y le pide que huyan juntos.
No esta el Final de Roxana/Ursula Prats, solo se ve cuando le entrega a Max el video a cambio de dinero y el luego llama a la Policia, pero no se ve cuando se la llevan.
Por otra parte Carmen Salinas, Manuel ""Flaco"" Ibaez y Cuathemoc Blanco brillan por su ausencia jeje, lo cual no me afecto en lo mas minimo porque sus Personajes eran puro relleno. Todo lo referente a Fernanda, la hermana de Max, Fabian (Marco Mendez), su mejor amigo, y la relacion de Fer con Cruz no esta en el Dvd, quitaron todo eso, al igual que con Naty, ella desaparece asi de la nada y no se ve ni siquiera cuando se casa con Juanjo ni mucho menos nada de su relacion.
El Dvd esta pesimamente editado, es de muy mal al gusto, todo lo que digo que le falta es poco y me quedo corto ya que han destrozado la Telenovela, este Dvd y el de Cuidado Con El Angel son los Peores Resumenes que he visto y de las Ms de 50 Telenovelas En Dvd que tengo. El Resumen se centra mucho en la historia de Victoria y Maria, dejan todo el dramatismo por la perdida de su hija y se pierde absolutamente todos los personajes y no dejan nada realmente interesante sobre los villanos. Un asco la verdad...",1321833600,17,6178,4.317555938037866

This edited version, I watched......the story on the dvd is so different to the original.  This dvd was an insult....I wish Televisa would wake up and smell the money that they could making the full 173 hours on dvd.  Many people would pay the price for the entire box set.

I bought it because I was going back to work and wouldn't be able to watch it in its entirety on tv. The DVD gives you the main idea and all the good stuff. That happens, but, you're missing all the hows. I have no idea how a whole lot of stuff comes to pass.",1440806400,,370,3.933333333333333

4834382,1,B005M9VSLY,This first episode on this DVD is such a mess I got a headache from it. The thing is I already watched this show. i wanted to own it and was greatly let down by how it did not even show how Max tries to woo her. The scenes where she was on the bus and he drives up next to it was not on it. The scene in the house we're they first got their first kiss was not even on this DVD. What's the purpose of putting on DVD if it's not going to be complete. I don't even understand the purpose of selling this DVD in the first place. If you are reading this and you have found a COMPLETE DVD SET please do so reply to me because I am just so disappointed. I do not recommend this DVD.,1437955200,3,675,3.727272727272727

4834437,3,B005M9VSLY,"This is a beautiful story and I love it however, I am very disappointed with the DVD. The editing is HORRIBLE. The scenes do not match. They jumped from episode 1 to half of episode 3 etc. It makes no sense. They cut out some of the most interesting and fun parts. The only thing I can say is that if your spanish is not rough and you can understand some words or expressions I recommend you  to watch it in spanish, at least that's what I should have done before buying this DVD. Even if you don't speak spanish fluently, you will understand the main context of it because the story is easy to follow. If you really like the show after watching it in Spanish and you want to make sure that you understand some of what they were saying or everything they said, you can buy the DVD but it is not going to have everything. DO NOT buy this DVD without watching the whole thing in spanish first because if you do, you will not be able to follow the story, you will feel lost and confused. It will be a waste of money.",1390003200,,1013,4.116161616161616
4834438,5,B005M9VSLY,"When the weak series began to flounder they brought in Mark Tacher in the role of Alonso, a photographer, who falls in love with and helps out Maite Perroni's character who is pregnant by the character of William Levy. He becomes the protagonist's rival and actually steals the show with his great looks and wonderful acting. William Levy, although very handsome, was overshadowed by the charisma and acting perfectionism of Mark Tacher. Alonso does not marry  his love because he knows he is dying although they make it to the altar. You can feel Alonso's pain of having to sacrifice the love of his life. Mark was in the novela just long enough  to bring the novela back to life and make it worth  watching. Unfortunately he was stronger than the protagonist so they gave him an illness perhaps just to get him out of the novela. Mark Tacher made the novela worth watching. This was certainly one of William Levy's weakest roles. He was great in Sortilegio. Victoria Ruffo was as usual a great actress. I recommend this just  for the great acting of Mark Tacher. Diego Oliveira was great in the role of a priest.",1389398400,,1114,4.6395939086294415

4834441,3,B005M9VSLY,"I agree with what the people write.  I love watching Spanish telenovelas and when they come out on DVD I try to purchase them, but they cut out a lot of the novela.  With today's technology you would think that they can put the whole novela on DVD, because if you want to purchase a series of TV shows from here in America you get the whole series not a third of it.  So I think that they should do the same with the novelas and not try to cheat the costumers. Because we're spending the money and not getting the whole novela.",1381708800,8,527,4.097087378640777

Very good customer service and I love this DVD- it has English subtitles and since I do not speak Spanish (but would love to one day) I have to watch this telenovela with English subtitles which I do not mind at all. I find it very easy to follow the storyline and the acting is just incredible.,1377216000,,483,4.318681318681318
4834445,3,B005M9VSLY,"The editing of the series should have had more thought other than how do we fit 176 episodes into 3 DVDs. There were many story lines and scenes that were needed to advance the beautiful story of Max and Maria that were not included in the DVDs and too many peripheral story lines that should have been cut instead. I am trying to learn how to speak Spanish and it was helpful to see it with the English subtitles. It was a good tool for me when I viewed the whole series in Spanish on another medium and I was able to understand about 50% of the story and I loved the series even more so when I saw it all. Maite Perroni and William Levy have great chemistry together that you almost believe that they are a couple in real life. I have seen William Levy in three different soap operas and he seems to play the same strong,loyal, loving, and sensitive character and I love it. However, I think this was the best character in which he portrayed such a sentimental man. I have seen Maite Perroni in two soap operas and I think she is beautiful, but she was really spectacular in this one.",1374883200,2,1086,4.251207729468599

Here we have two girls raised in an orphanage. One is greedy and ambitious, the other is a sweetie who loves to cook. The sweet one leaves to seek her fortune in the big city, only to be robbed before she even rents a room. The greedy one discovers who their parents are and hates that her own mother left her in a dumpster, while her friend's grandmother is a wealthy woman who owns a catering company. Of course that poor friend doesn't know....

We discover that the wealthy woman paid someone to provide an infant corpse so she could pretend her granddaughter had died at birth. The broken-hearted parents go on to marry and have a poverty-stricken but happy life despite the wealthy dame disowning her son.

Our sweetie meets a doctor during a downpour and he falls for her. He ends up paying her fees at a cooking school and asking the school to pretend it is a scholarship. The greedy best friend arrives in the city ready to pretend to be the caterer's granddaughter. She has more lies up her sleeve and is clever, beautiful and resourceful. She is also ruthless! Enter the lady-killer man-about-town who also falls for the sweetie. He is a master chef who teaches at that cooking school. After lies, murders, skulduggery and DNA tests, we have an unexpected but happy ending. Whew!

4834451,1,B005M9VSLY,It was horrible. They cut the episodes so much that it didn't even give me a chance to fall in love with the characters. I saw this novela when it was on tv a while back so i know that it was good...its just that it was badly edited more like they took out most of it. :-(,1360972800,2,272,3.706896551724138

4834453,5,B005M9VSLY,"I bought this novela for my 17 year old daughter, becasue she likes William Levy.  She has seen the soap opera from the TV and comparing it to the DVD she says they took out a lot that was on the TV novela, but she still likes it.
Thank you",1358035200,,240,3.8
4834454,1,B005M9VSLY,Skip too much. Want to see some chapter that was not include. Never again. I don't recommend this purchase to anyone. I was very upset.,1357948800,,135,4.44
4834455,5,B005M9VSLY,"Great actors who have been in other telenovelas.

The story has so many surprises that you don't want the movie to end.

Another awesome story that is a must see even though it's a remake of ""El Privilegio de Amar"" which I have also seen.  What's amazing is that the actor (Cesar Evora) who played the priest in the original ""El Privilegio de Amar"" now plays the doctor in the newer movie ""Triunfo Del Amor"".",1356652800,,408,4.413333333333333

4834457,3,B005M9VSLY,"This telenovela is about a very sweet lovestory and I really liked the show when I lived abroad. However, the editing is horrible, there should had been at least one more disk. Important parts are cut out, so that it seems things happens unnaturally fast, we miss important stories and details, some characters are almost cut out from show, and more than once you will ask yourself ""what happend now?"" It's really frustrating that it seems they just decided to cut out an entire episode or more here or there. Would like to see the show as it was shown on television.",1353542400,,567,4.568627450980392

4834459,5,B005M9VSLY,I so enjoyed Triunfo del amor but wished there were more episodes.  I watched all the episodes on Dailymotion but missed so much on the tapes because alot was left out.  I do not speak Spanish so the 3 discs sent helped me so much to understand exactly what was going on.  I only wished there were more discs.  I would gladly pay for more content.  I also bought Cuidado con el angel and enjoyed that immensely.  DVDs were very clear and translation to English made it so enjoyable to watch.  Thank you.,1346630400,,503,4.344086021505376
4834460,2,B005M9VSLY,"I had been waiting for a long time to receive this novela, but it has been a great disappointment. The whole story was awfully edited, all of the special parts and interesting parts of this soap opera have been removed. If I would have know this earlier I would have never bought this at all... very disappointed indeed!! :(",1345593600,16,324,4.508474576271187
4834461,5,B005M9VSLY,"I really love this Novela but I have 3 discs in it worth 4 hours each. When I put in a disc it tells me there is 4 discs but I only have 3...and the cover also says more then 12 hours....well...I only got 12 hours on the entire thing...what am I missing? I felt I was missing something when a scene happened, about alfonso saving someone from being kidnapped? I never saw it happen...and how quickly people were forgiven....I must be missing something...Other then that I enjoyed the Novela but was highly confused.",1341619200,,515,4.48936170212766
4834462,3,B005M9VSLY,"I've been wanting to see this for the longest. The show was alright, but the editing was terrible. It was very choppy; the scenes did not match up. I rather watch the entire series on Televisa channel. Hopefully, it will come on again.",1338508800,7,235,4.488372093023256

4834464,5,B005M9VSLY,"Triunfo Del Amor, was a perfect escape to a ficticious world where eventually all good prevails.  The characters are clearly defined and interesting and beautiful and able to show perfect appropriate emotions and facial expressions to communicate every perfect relationship problem possible in life or anywhere, fantasyland. Entertaining to watch over and over. I was always a fan of every 80s night time soap opera, but I'm finding the Telenovela medium is better and I like the emotion expressed. Concern for the family and passion for the family is a compelling theme to me. Like Jewish Bible stories. I like to see self sacrifice in love stories to keep a group or family together. That interests me. I like to see characters who show emotion and work toward a goal against great odds. Like God could be helping them. The casting for this was perfection for every role. Easy to watch.",1335052800,,888,4.880794701986755
