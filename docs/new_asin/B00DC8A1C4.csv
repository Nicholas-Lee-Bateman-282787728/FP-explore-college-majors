8591623,5,B00DC8A1C4,"I think Dennis Lynch is an excellent person.  These DVD's show it like it really is.  Dennis goes out on a limb, risking his own life at times, to get video of events happening.  The guy is very cool.  The BEST thing I just heard yesterday is that Dennis Michael Lynch is going to be doing his own show on NEWSMAX TV, starting in January, 2016.  Great TV news station, by the way that you can watch for free on streaming, or on your phone. Dennis, JD Hayworth, and Steve Malzberg present the TRUTH of what is happening in this country, without the lies we hear everyday by the hand fed lies we would otherwise have to watch from our news media ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and even FOX.",1449187200,,679,4.232558139534884

8591626,5,B00DC8A1C4,"In a time when the media is flooded with vast amounts of misinformation, that is purposely used to create confusion, this documentary stands alone in clearing through all the fog and addressing the real problems facing the failing immigration system, failed border security and the faltering unity among the American populace. It bravely and accurately investigates the border issues from all sides and goes in depth as to the true costs of leaving a national border unsecured. It's a must see for all Americans and those who would like to one day become Americans.",1404172800,5,565,5.0212765957446805
8591627,5,B00DC8A1C4,"It's a shame EVERYONE doesn't know or are aware of what is happening in this great Nation of ours. These two films will wake you up. The real mystery is, why, it is allowed to be happening. As, 'European-Americans', we will be the minority in this country before the beginning of the next decade. Uneducated Mexican and Central American Latinos are pouring over our border in droves. With NO desire to learn English or adapt to our way of life. And our present government is placating to them...Why !? The above mentioned movie explains the ,'How', (it is happening), just not the solution. See the movie _ It's terrific !",1402185600,,622,4.663636363636364
8591628,5,B00DC8A1C4,"This film has the potential to unite the citizens of our once great country and empower us to rise up against the media, polititions and self interest groups who work so hard to divide us. That alone is grounds for those in power to blacklist Mr. Lynch. I'm sending a copy to my liberal friends, my conservative friends and those who feel powerless and no longer seem to care. My only request is that they watch the entire film. It is not easy to watch. Truth is hard to digest when you've been fed a regular diet of untruth (aka lies).",1385078400,5,536,4.316831683168317
8591629,5,B00DC8A1C4,"Dennis Michael Lynch produces a brave, powerful, non-racist film that alas, takes on the subject of Immigration and Amnesty in America with hard facts, raw honesty and ""in-your-face"" action. Every American citizen should worry. Every American should sit down to watch this straightforward, often intense, documentary, fully absorb it and then pass it on to their family and friends to watch too! We are not being fed truthful news by the present mainstream media in this country, whether or not Americans want to believe it, and certainly not from a ""transparent"" Washington, DC.!

Enlighten yourselves with the truth and arm yourselves with the information in this DVD, then see if you don't agree that the immigration reform bill presently being sold by President Obama, Janet Napolitano and the Gang of 8 is one that will kill America as we know it. It would leave this country reeling, economically broken and extremely dangerous (if it isn't already dangerous). While chilling in instances, the film reveals the truth about U.S. border security today and what is (or, more accurately, is not) being done to keep Americans safe. It's an eye-opener - allowing us to see real evidence of what is happening at our border with Mexico. What's really going on, if nothing short of ineptness and neglect, is tragic. Packed with well investigated, honest journalism covering the topic of illegal immigration (and corruption) in America, it gives the perfect argument for rejecting the current Gang of 8 Immigration Reform Bill!

""They Come to America II"" is one of the best documentaries ever produced and critical in inspiring us, if not motivating us all to snap out of our stupor, fight and fight hard to alas save America! The film is well worth the length in time watching and listening! The film is thought-provoking and moves along well. I plan to watch it again and let my friends and family digest (for themselves) the riveting information Dennis Michael Lynch collected and presents so vividly, as well.

Bravo! I thank Dennis Michael Lynch for his honesty and courage in tackling, up till now, what has been an untouchable, unapproachable or at least, uninspired topic. I thank him for uncovering a darkness that nobody else cares to tell us about with any semblance of sincerity. In my book, he is a true patriot with a voice well worth listening to. Americans are amiss if they don't scream a resounding ""NO"" to the Immigration Reform Bill.  But first, watch this film, educate and know for yourself why the bill is (or would be) so wrong for America.",1371686400,15,2560,4.932714617169373
