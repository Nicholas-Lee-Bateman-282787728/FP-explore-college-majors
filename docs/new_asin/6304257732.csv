817144,2,6304257732,"If you want to learn the basics of Irish dance, this is not a good choice.  Colin is an extremely gifted dancer and his moves are impressive.  However, he flies through the steps far too quickly and you will find  yourself hitting rewind over and over and OVER to pick up a step.
If you  are already familiar with all the basic steps, this could be a good tape to  practice along with and enhance what you've learned  elsewhere.
Incidentally, the quality of the video isn't great - the  lighting is poor and it seems more like a home video than a professional  recording.",956448000,20,571,4.423076923076923
817324,2,6304257732,"This was exactly what I was looking for!  However it will only play on my computer and not on my dvd!  A message comes up that says it can't play because of area limitations.  I have Direct TV and use their provided DVD. I took it to my son's house...he has Dish and the same thing happened. I then took it to my daughter's house...she has a projection TV and it wouldn't play there either!  I really cannot learn this dance in my home office...there is no room and I want to see it on a big screen TV, not a computer monitor!",1375747200,,526,4.077669902912621
817325,5,6304257732,"It was very entertaining.  I enjoyed it, but, it was a little hard to teach to my students.  I think they need a lot more practice before they really understand it.  I'll keep trying.  Thanks,",1370563200,,192,4.4
817326,1,6304257732,"This DVD is NOT for beginners!!!  Collin moves way to fast for anyone
who is just learning to catch on to anything!  I would suggest
watching youtube if you want to learn how to do Irish dancing
it is easier that way and a lot easier to follow!!!
I gave this item one star because you have to give it something.",1337990400,,311,4.081967213114754
817327,3,6304257732,"I agree with another review.  I have pushed rewind beyond count!  Part of what I have difficulty with is Colin is facing forward which means his instructions are backwards for me.  If he is really about teaching the step, he should have his back to the camera so we're on the same facing foot.
He is very talented but does go way too fast.",1294790400,,339,4.265625
817328,2,6304257732,As a beginning celtic dancer I did not find this DVD to be helpful. I thought he was hard to follow and he doesn't call out the steps consistently. I don't recommend this for beginners.,1270512000,3,185,4.314285714285714
817329,2,6304257732,While I was bored to tears watching the video my grandaughter (10) seems to enjoy dancing along to it. Most of the lessons are for adults and complicated but she does seem to have fun.,1264032000,2,184,4.285714285714286
817330,2,6304257732,"I bought this DVD because of all the celtic dancing DVD reviews I read, this one seemed to be the most accessible. If so, then maybe I'm not cut out for celtic dance. The instruction given seems to be aimed at people who already know how to dance. It's brief, done only once, covers 8-9 moves at a time, and when Dunne lets you try it out, the music is at full tempo. This is pretty frustrating and not made more helpful by his frequent use of ""this very simple step..."" ""the most basic move...""

It's a fun DVD, and he's a great dancer. And I'll probably try it again. But if you're looking for an easy 'in' to Celtic Dance, as I was,  I'd look somewhere else.",1226880000,18,661,4.15625
817331,5,6304257732,"For someone who has never danced and wants to learn Irish Dance this is an outstanding video.  Each movement of each step is done at a slow pace and then in a group at the regular speed. The only fault with the video itself is that you can not replay the steps over and over. But that aside, the DVD is an inexpensive way to learn basic Irish dance steps.",1203638400,28,355,4.071428571428571
817332,5,6304257732,"Most will remember Colin Dunne from Riverdance: NYC. What more can be said about a man that has won 11 All-Ireland and 9 World championships??? (Eat your heart out Michael Flatley!) This man is the most elegant and beautiful Irish dancer recorded thus far. If you'd like to learn from the best, and witness this incredible talent at his peak, buy this video! I would also recommend, of course, Riverdance: NYC, and Dancing On Dangerous Ground, co-starring the always fantastic Jean Butler,

The dances on this video are relatively simple for a beginner and really fun to learn. I use them to work out! You'd be surprised how quickly you get your heartrate up by doing them. Lots of fun!!",1202428800,33,687,4.725
817333,5,6304257732,"i have tried this video before and i have been searching for it on dvd for some time...
it is so much fun and as an instructor, colin changes everything and makes it so easy to enjoy the whole learning thing - celtic soft or hard shoe is not easy - he makes it look so simple.

for anyone thinking of taking this form of dance or who just wants to have fun and move your feet - enjoy this for all that it is worth and believe me it is worth everything.",1191974400,42,452,3.860215053763441
817433,2,6304257732,"I have had this video for years. I only did it for six months. The moves are hard to learn, and if you don't have the proper shoes and the proper floor to practice on, you WILL injure yourself! I got pretty good at the moves but the stomping resulted in Achilles' tendonitis for me, which I still suffer from. If you truly want to learn Irish dancing, take a class from an instructor in a proper setting. Don't risk injury with this video.",1104278400,9,439,4.238095238095238
817434,3,6304257732,"I was looking forward to this video. Knowing nothing of how to Irish Dance (except for my free imitations done watching others), I bought this video thinking I might learn how to do some basic steps. Unfortunately, this is not a good video to learn by. Learning videos need a little bit of a boring quality, that is, watching from one camera angle one full practice step done slowly to rythm. But we never see the beginning steps done simply to rythm by one person; we jump from Mr. Dunne to the right, to the left, full body, just the feet, the others, which makes all of this more confusing. It seems like the director did not know if he was going to teach or entertain. However, if you are already an intermediate to professional Irish dancer already, I recommend this video. Or, if you want to enjoy watching how Irish dance is learned by professional dancers, but have no intention to get out of the sofa and try it, I recommend it.
p.s. - Do you think you could make another video called ""Jig for Dummies""? That I would buy",1046822400,14,1029,4.392670157068062
817435,2,6304257732,"The steps on this tape move along so fast, it was frequently very difficult to keep up. It needs to explain things better and more clearly. Definately not for beginners or for people with two left feet. I'll pass.",1036195200,2,213,4.487179487179487
817436,5,6304257732,"Very easy to follow without being too easy. It is a must-have video for anyone who is serious about Irish dance. There are very few insturctional videos out there, and this is by far one of the better ones.  I would highly recommend this one for anyone's collection.",1015545600,4,266,4.541666666666667
817437,5,6304257732,"If you've ever bought an instructional video and felt cheated that you paid a lot for very little information, you won't have that complaint with this one.  Some of the reviewers of this video complain that it goes too fast, but that's why we have pause buttons on our VCRs!  Each 5 minutes of this video will take a beginner one month to master, but each of the steps is done sufficiently slowly to allow it to be diagramed and repeated.  You will spend 6 months to one year on this one-hour video if you are serious.  I highly recommend it.",1010534400,14,542,4.336633663366337
817438,3,6304257732,"I have both tap and modern jazz experience under my belt, and I still had a very hard time following this tape.  He only demonstrates each move once and then puts it with very fast paced music.  It takes alot (and I mean ALOT) of rewinding and repeating to get these steps.  If you are really serious about learning this style of dance, and put in the time and effort, then this tape will probably be useful.  If you're just curious, then this video has some great performances.",1004140800,7,478,4.3977272727272725
817439,2,6304257732,"This video is very hard to follow and is much to fast-paced. They assume a working knowledge of dance which I certainly don't have!
And I know this is very sophmoric of me, but everytime I think of the fact that it's by Weinerworld Productions...I go off into gales of laughter!  She said weiner...hunh, hunh.
But Colin Dunn and everyone in the video are undoubtedly very gifted dancers!",997315200,4,387,4.6911764705882355

817442,3,6304257732,"i bought this video about a year ago and it was good for the first couple times I saw it~ but no matter how hard I tried~ his steps were too hard once I got past the first couple steps.  They are way too advanced and the  quality of the video isn't all that great.  I would maybe recommend this  vieo for a student of irish dancing who already knows the basics, but to a  beginner, this is just too difficult.",963964800,2,409,4.0
