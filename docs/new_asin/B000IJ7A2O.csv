2657940,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I liked this workout. It was easy to follow, but still very challenging!!! I Like Tracey York as instructor anyway, and she leads in one of these workouts. I do like the other 2 instructors too, I Like Tracey Best!!",1179014400,10,215,4.4
2657941,2,B000IJ7A2O,"I prefer doing workout videos to going to the gym, but this one is not really worth the 18 bucks.  The incredibly fast pace, confusing camera angles, poor instruction, and bad music combine to give a dissatisfying workout.  It moves so quickly with so little explanation that a novice could easily injure themselves.  Also, there are 3 express workouts on this video that target either your arms, legs, or abs.  I've only done the abs one, but it was totally ridiculous and only 5 minutes long.  At one point they have you rolling around on the floor, not a viable option on the tile in my living room...that's why you use a mat: to stay on it!  I would say try a Kathy Smith video...she puts together challenging, safe workouts that make sense.",1176508800,7,745,4.56390977443609
2657942,2,B000IJ7A2O,"I began working out in January in an attempt to tone up for my August wedding. I bought this dvd along with the ""transforming"" dvd as I thought it would help me look great in my honeymoon bikini. To start off, I am 5'6'' 140 lbs, and realatively toned; I was not necessarily trying to lose weight, I was mostly looking for something to give me that extra toned look for my big day.

These dvds promise big results, but make it difficult to achieve them. The moves are fast, confusing and poorly queued. I would just be figuring out how to do the move when we would suddenly change completely. They instructors themselves are extremely annoying and hard to follow. Also, I consider my thighs to be my ""problem area"" and was horrified to notice that ALL 3 of the instructors on the dvds had VERY noticible jiggly thighs. Very discouraging! I liked that a resistance band came with the dvds, and I also liked that they included ""mini target zone workouts,"" but overall, I felt very disappointed. I used each dvd a couple of times and then left them on the shelf.

If you want a great, rewarding workout, try Tamilee Webb's ""I Want That Body,"" Carmen Electra's ""Fit to Strip,"" or The Firm's ""Transfirmer Step with 3 dvds""",1176422400,8,1217,4.502262443438914
2657943,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I have added both routines on this dvd to my weekly rotation 2 times a week (along with the 3 mini workouts) and I am impressed!  There is some great variety here, and the moves are surprisingly intense if you really put your all into them.  I was surprised to see that many reviewers felt as though the moves were too fast or confusing to follow.. for an upper-intermediate, advanced exerciser (which the video is classified as this) who is familiar with basic moves, this is not the case.  Sure I stumbled a bit the first 1-2 times through.. but who doesn't when working out to a new video?  The key is to stick with it, because it will become routine just as any other workout vid.  I have been working out at home for several years, and I have seen some very noticeable changes in my legs and glutes because of these Shape routines.  This is a fun one if you really focus... have fun with it and PUSH yourself!",1176336000,19,914,4.315789473684211
2657944,3,B000IJ7A2O,"This workout is OK.  It's moderately difficult, but not quite challenging enough for me.  I prefer the Cindy Crawford New Dimension workout.  It has two beginner level workouts, then a 40 minute workout.  That 40 minute workout better works your body than this Shape workout.  This one employs various muscle groups, but does not very thoroughly work them out.  If you are at a more advanced level, you might not find this workout enough of a challenge.",1174089600,11,453,4.818181818181818
2657945,2,B000IJ7A2O,"I purchased a couple of the videos in this series, including this one.  I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed in all of them.  There wasn't much ""new"" here to keep me interested, and I found I was pretty bored.  Each of the 30-minute workouts themselves are pretty intense, and definitely get your muscles burning, but the instructors do not break down any of the moves before they do them, and I found it difficult to figure out what they were going to do next.  With practice, I guess this might get better.  And the three 5-minute ""mini-workouts"" for abs, legs, and arms were good, but not long enough to really feel much of anything.  As soon as I started to get into them, they were over!  Again, I guess it might help to do these every day or something.  However, I can't seem to get myself to do these DVDs - there's just not enough excitement or innovation here to keep me interested!",1171843200,12,898,4.4
2657946,2,B000IJ7A2O,"This is my first Shape DVD, and I won't be buying another.  The workout seemed old-school, with the usual stomping around and resistance moves.  Program 2 is a rehash of Program 1, and you will not be cross-training if you alternate them.  Also, I have some arthritis in my hands, and wrapping the resistance band around them & pulling was uncomfortable.

I bought this DVD partly because Lisa Wheeler was on it.  I'm a big fan, having done her workouts with The Method.  I also notice that she's Denise Austin's choreographer for her newer workouts, and I love them.  As usual, she (and the other instructors) did a great job of demonstrating & cueing.  I just didn't like the workout.

Update:  The second time I used the band included with this dvd, it snapped apart in 2 pieces in my hands.  Fortunately it didn't hit me, but be warned!",1171411200,7,840,4.570469798657718
2657947,5,B000IJ7A2O,"This is a great dvd.  It 'stars' three top instructors (Tracey York, Michelle Dozois and Lisa Wheeler).  They are all excellent instructors who cue really clearly but also make this a fun workout to do.  They include a great introduction at the beginning of the workout (while the options are on the screen).

The first workout is 30 minutes of a circuit type training.  I found it to be easy to follow and yet it's really effective and fun and you will burn calories.  They also give you a dyna-band inside the disc.  This and weights are the two main pieces of equipment you need.  Each instructor does a great job and they all chip in with advice throughout the routine.

It has a cool set, and an infectious energy about it.  This is definately going to be a new favourite of mine because it's full of variety and really enjoyable (you have so much fun that you feel like you aren't working out).  I think this is excellent for anyone wanting to get fit and shed some pounds.  I love it and think you will too.",1169078400,17,1014,4.363636363636363
2657948,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I've been training for the last 15 years, and since I became a mom, I couldn't go to the gym anymore, so I've tried several in home workouts, and the ones in this DVD are really good, there are some details though. Since there are combined movements to maximize the effort, whoever uses this DVD has to know about postures when working out, or it can be dangerous for the leg articulations and mussles. But besides that, it's great and I highly recommend it, it's fun and the combination of movements is great for someone that doesn't have one hour to train, in 30 minutes you get to burn a lot more calories and you feel the immediate reaction of your mussles as soon as you start training.",1230768000,,691,4.40625
2657949,5,B000IJ7A2O,"This is a great dvd for anyone who wants a challenging, energetic, fun workout!  You work all the major muscle groups and sweat a lot besides.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to lose weight or just stay in shape.  Love it!!!",1229385600,,230,4.3023255813953485
2657950,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I think this is a great total body workout.  I haven't done program 1 yet, but have done program 2 numerous times and get a great workout every time.  I love the cardio blasts and the short, but effective strength portions.  I highly recommend it!",1224201600,,247,4.444444444444445
2657951,5,B000IJ7A2O,"The second workout in this dvd is my absolute favorite shape workout!!! Busts my butt every time! Challenging but doable and effective cardio right here! I also use Cathe Freidrich, The Firm, 30 Day Shred, and various other workout dvds of all types. I have lost 90 lbs and kept it off for 4 years with workout videos. I highly recommend this video for the intermediate/ advanced exercisers!",1212537600,,391,4.764705882352941
2657952,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I like the instructors and the different workouts on this dvd, I also own the second Shape Bikini Body Camp dvd, so I can mix and match the different workouts. If you don't want to spend much money I recommend to buy those two dvds together and you will get a week full of workouts, and you won't get bored. You get cardio, toning and circuit, all that with three instructors.",1208563200,3,376,4.309859154929577
2657953,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I loved these 2 workouts! The first workout is a circuit workout alternating cardio with weights. The routines were harder to follow than the ones in the other Bikini Body Workout by Shape but nothing you can't get used to if you do the workout a few more times. The 2nd workout was easier to follow and much more intense with longer cardio sessions and shorter weight workouts. I was dripping by the time I finished the 2nd workout! I typically use 5lb weights because I am trying not to build bulk when I work out but you could easily handle 8 to 10lb weights with either of these 2 workouts. I wouldn't go higher than that. The band isn't used as much as you think it would be used but it's nice to have so you can do your own workouts. I think if you combined these 2 workouts with the 3 from the other bikini dvd, you would have a great, 5 day program that would definitely challenge you! I agree with the others, on both DVDs, the comments are annoying but I guess they shouldn't just stand around and say nothing either! I highly recommend this tape!",1206403200,4,1057,4.29
2657954,2,B000IJ7A2O,"Initially, I bought the Transforming DVD & loved it, so I bought this one to add variety to my workout routine.  This one didn't seem to raise my heart rate as high as the other one.  I suppose it provides an ok workout in a pinch.",1196380800,9,231,4.0
2657955,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I bought this DVD to replace, not supplement, my usual gym cardio workout.  It's great!  The DVD has three different workouts to choose from: Cardio, Strength Toning and Potpourri, which has a little bit of everything.  They all last 30 minutes, which is great when you want to get an effective workout in a shorter amount of time.  The first time I did the cardio segment, I definitely got my heart rate up and was so sore the next day, which was surprising, because I work out pretty regularly.  The strength segment also gets your heart rate going, so even though it is not billed as cardio, it gets the job done.  The instructors are all very clear and fun, and the moves aren't so challenging that you can't follow along, but they don't break it down for you so much where you are bored, either.  Definitely recommend this.",1196035200,,828,4.516778523489933
2657956,1,B000IJ7A2O,"My g/f bought this DVD and we did it together.  Many of the moves are confusing and awkward to do and they switch to another move before you have the previous one down, so you feel like you're always behind.  The music is repetitive so it doesn't take long before it gets tiring.

I barely got my heartbeat up by following along.  This DVD just annoyed me more than anything.",1188691200,5,375,4.314285714285714
2657957,5,B000IJ7A2O,"As an intermediate/advanced exerciser looking for a time efficient workout, this is it! Workout 1 is intermediate and offers a wider variety of moves with less squats. Workout 2 is more intense. It has a lot of squats and basically involves running in place, hopping, and squating with a few other toning moves (like lunges). The intensity is high, though. There is absolutely no danciness to this workout--just athletic moves--and no kickboxing. The reps are not a lot with the strength parts so I would recommend for someone advanced to up the suggested 3-5 lbs to more like 8-12 which is what I used. These workouts are very straight up non dancy and a great total body workout in 30 minutes you don't stop moving. Plus if you don't have a lot of room to exercise these are good videos.  However, I always do both workouts at one time.",1184716800,28,838,4.624161073825503
8145668,4,B000IJ7A2O,"This is a good workout to have on your off days.  It's intense, but not hard core. Really gets your heart rate up.  Not a lot of impact on the joints.",1474848000,,150,3.806451612903226
8145669,3,B000IJ7A2O,"The two 30 minute routines on the disc are engaging and relatively fun to do and include great cardio segments. However, the strength training portions (with hand weights and the resistance band) don't have enough repetitions to significantly build decent muscle tone; I modify the workout by pausing the disc and performing more reps to really go for ""the burn"".  Still, I do like this DVD overall and don't regret the purchase. Just don't expect advanced weight segments that are more challenging.  I guess that's what the additional five-minute workouts are for, but frankly, I would have preferred if the trainers just added more challenge with increased reps to the actual full workouts for convenience sake and skip the add-on segments.",1449273600,,742,5.12396694214876
8145670,4,B000IJ7A2O,"This DVD contains two, 30-minute workouts that will have your heart pumping and your body sweating. Both workouts use the stretch band that comes with the DVD, as well as a pair of weights. I use eight-pounders myself. Tracy York is the lead instructor on the first workout, Interval Circuit. Tracy blends cardio and sculpt into one quick, 30-minute workout. Lisa Wheeler is the lead instructor on the second workout, Cardio Interval Sculpt. This one is mainly cardio, but Lisa throws in some exercises with weights for good measure. There are also three, five-minute bonus segments. Tracy leads the arms segment. Lisa instructs the upper body segment. Michelle Dozois instructs the abs segment. I like how there are three instructors like this because I get to see three different styles of workout instruction. Tracy and Lisa are my two favorite instructors of the three.",1402272000,,873,5.069444444444445
8145671,5,B000IJ7A2O,"This is a great workout. The instructors have moves that really push you to work up a great sweat. It's fun and goes by fast. I love the 5 minute targeted extras, too, so I can get a 5 minute ab workout after all that cardio.",1374278400,,225,3.9130434782608696
8145672,5,B000IJ7A2O,"Do yourself a favor and ignore the negative reviews. This DVD offers two great interval circuit style workouts that are cued well with a 15 minute toning chapter at the end. The 2nd interval routine is very high impact - and yes, this IS good for you. Why you would recommend boring Ellen Barrett, cheesy Kathy Smith or irritating Denise Austin over this workout, I don't know. This is by far more challenging and better produced. I usually do Kelly Coffey, Amy Bento, Cathe ,etc., but have started to really like Michelle Dozois, even though she is not leading these two routines. However, she does in The Transforming Workout which is recommendable as well. I'm glad I finally gave this one a try.",1288915200,3,699,4.691056910569106
8145673,2,B000IJ7A2O,"I purchased this DVD after reading numerous reviews stating how challenging it was.  However, I would describe this video as old and tired.  It looks like it was filmed at least 10 years ago.  I'm not sure if this workout was designed for older viewers, but it looks and feels that way.  I finished this workout without having broken a sweat -- but all three ladies (40+) looked like they had just come in from a rainstorm.  The cardio involves a lot of hopping around -- very hard on your joints -- without being very challenging.  The first workout is billed as interval and strength training, but hardly calls for you to pick up a weight.  Save your money and look for a good cardio-pilates video -- like one with Ellen Barrett.",1278720000,,731,4.492424242424242
8145674,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I'm an intermediate/advanced, consistent exerciser.  This DVD and the other DVD in this set- the ""Bikini Body Transforming Workout""- are an amazing workout set!  I have never done a better workout series, on a DVD or in the gym.  They are tough!  But great!  Between the two DVDs, there are 5 30-minute workouts.  They are all great cardio, and all work your lower and middle body very well.  Some focus more on total body toning too.  They also include power moves and balance. I find the workouts fun and am never bored.  There are 5 workouts, so I never do the same workout twice in one week.  Within a few weeks, I've seen changes in my body, mostly in my butt and abs.  I also feel much healthier and more energetic. I've felt much better all around since doing these workouts, and therefore genuinely, actually look forward to doing them.  The instructors are great and never get annoying!

This ""Redefining"" DVD has 3 5-minute ""mini-workouts"" for the lower body, abs, and upper body that you can add on as well.  I don't do the lower body 5-minute workout because the main workouts kill my lower body as it is.  I add on a 5-minute workout from Shape's ""Shape.. Your Abs"" DVD because I find them better than the 5-minute one on the ""Redefining"" DVD.  But I do add the 5-min upper body workout to the days when I do the workouts focused on strength.

Overall I'd highly recommend these videos.  You get cardio, strength, endurance, power, balance, and energy in 30-minutes.  They are highly efficient, well designed workouts that are very fun to do and make me feel great!",1262476800,3,1578,4.591397849462366
8145675,4,B000IJ7A2O,"Lisa Wheeler, Michelle Dozois, and Tracy York are experts at designing effective routines, cuing well, and motivating their viewers.  These two programs are very efficient at burning a lot of calories in a short period of time with intense cardio and toning circuits.  The three ladies work well together and create an environment that is fun, yet you know you are still working hard.  I always feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish the workouts, especially the second one, which is more intense than the first.  The only reason I hesitate to give this five stars is because the three mini toning workouts at the end did not seem very effective to me.  If they had been just a little bit longer, then they would have been a great addition to an already-good DVD.  They are so short, however, that they really don't accomplish much.  All in all, however, this is an efficient, well-made, professional, and motivating DVD that increased my endurance and sped up my toning results.",1252195200,,985,4.792899408284024
8145676,5,B000IJ7A2O,"I love this DVD!  This gives you an all over body workout. I wouldn't recommend this to beginners.  I exercise regularly, and still find myself yelling at the TV because of the intensity.  But the results are worth the pain!
They do simple, intense moves that really work. A+!",1236211200,,276,4.591836734693878
8145677,4,B000IJ7A2O,"I just bought this more than a week ago and I am feeling awesome... I am pretty petite in build, I am 5'4"" and weigh 125 right now.  I bought this to tone up and possibly lose about 10 lbs to bring me to 115, which is what I look best at.  I feel like I am standing taller from the ab workouts and my legs feel like they are more toned.  I started out not using any weights, just to get the movements down since I have never really excercised my arms with weights before (besides lifting my 5 year old).  I can still feel my muscles working without the weights, so I can't wait to add them in.  I really love the 5 minute ab workout, too... it reminds me of Pilates a little.  I am super excited to see what this does for me, so I will post again in a month to let others know of my progress.",1236124800,,792,3.8580246913580245
