8185818,5,B000OOQSXK,"This is an excellent introduction to the battle of Trafalgar. Unlike the other videos that I have reviewed on Nelson, this one focuses events leading to battle and not just on Nelson. It puts the battle within the context of the Napoleonic Wars. There are clips from movies and reenactments of men firing cannon from the ship, which make this an interesting and exciting video to watch. Particularly interesting are the reenactors who portray Admiral Villeneuve and a British seaman, Robinson (aka Jack Nastyface). Both speak to the camera, saying things that the real life person wrote. There are also 3D graphics that show the movements of the ships. Also discussed are life aboard ship, battle tactics, types of shot and a host of other things. Commentary is by Dr. David Chandler of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. This video moves along at a snappy pace and I hardly noticed that an hour had passed. I highly recommend this video.",1180828800,,944,4.869565217391305
