8662917,5,B00KZKWQO8,"This is the most adorable show. It always has a good message of friendship and love. It is set in the woodlands and the scenery is made of watercolor and is absolutely beautiful. The characters are beautifully drawn and colored as well. I am always amazed over the wonderful richness of the colors and details of the illustrations.

The theme song is beautiful. The voices of the characters are mostly realistic (except the mouse), but every one of them has a cute voice. This is not one of those annoying shows that you'll wish your children would not watch. It is a great show and even I enjoy watching it. The characters speak slowly and clearly and it helped my daughter learn a lot of vocabulary when she learned to talk. She is now three-years-old and still loves this show as much as she always has. I've never known a children's cartoon better than this one. Much better than the rest of the junk that's on TV.

This particular DVD contains the following episodes: 1. Autumn's Here, 2. Pumpkin Patch, 3. Four Seasons, 4. Chestnut, 5. The Big Apple, 6. Surprise, 7. I Want to Fly. It runs 80 minutes long in all. This DVD consists of Little Nutbrown Hare exploring nature and all of the changes in the meadow that take place when summer turns to autumn.",1455321600,,1260,4.521929824561403
