You have to deal with the subtitles, but hey at least you get to watch them in order and make sense and most people prefer subtitles, so that's a bonus to them. It can be a little childish, but it also holds value for the adult too. A very enjoyable anime.",1377734400,2,336,4.265625

8169310,5,B000MHXCVU,"it includes volumes  1 thru 18 of the popular anime series Cardcaptor Sakura.  It revolves around a girl named Sakura who happens upon this weird looking book in her father's work area.  Of course being the curious, wide eyed girl she has to open the book and thus beginning the series.  As she has to capture all of the Clow cards that have escaped.  The series itself is cool and enjoyable for just about anyone that is into or might be interested in anime.  While it has a lean towards the younger audience.  There's more than enough comic relief and action from the older characters in this series.  Like her father, brother and someone that she fancies quite a lot Yukito (who has a secret or two of his own).  I think she's a bit young to be into a guy much older than her.

But its more of her just enjoying being around him than anything else.  Plus with all the adventures that Sakura and her companion (Kero) and best friend (who also makes her weird looking costumes) that she wears throughout her exploits.  She also enjoys filming and then watching these adventures at home (kind of weird but not too much).

Its a great series and long lasting so you won't fly through this in a few days.  Well worth the purchase of the whole set together.",1209340800,3,1254,4.419213973799127
