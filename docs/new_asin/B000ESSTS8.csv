2533396,2,B000ESSTS8,"As soon as they started quoting Al Gore as their main reference regarding man-made ""Global Warming"" (now called climate change because of the negative connotation attached to the previous term due to bad and corrupted data that had to be shredded), I had to stop taking it seriously because anything attached to Al Gore cannot be trusted.  They also totally misrepresent Revelations, just as every other new age attempt to interpret scripture without knowing the culture at the time, knowing what they knew (the ancient Jewish scriptures), and knowing how to actually read the Bible for all its worth.",1339200000,5,601,5.070707070707071
2533397,2,B000ESSTS8,"Despite its claims, this documentary does not in fact prove that every time Apple comes out with a new product, Armageddon will follow. As I write, the iPad 3 has come to market and the heavens did not fall.",1332115200,3,207,4.333333333333333
2533398,3,B000ESSTS8,i guess i was expecting more than old facts. I was looking for more actual facts but it is my fault because the DVD was made a while ago.,1286841600,3,137,3.7586206896551726
2533399,3,B000ESSTS8,"I cannot really recommend this DVD.  Most of what is in the DVD is relevant, but there are so many better places to go for the information.  In 1996, this would have been an amazing video, but too much has happened since then.  This DVD is in big need of an update.  The Biblical message is accurate, and that's the best part, but any Missler, Stone or other DVD on Biblical prophecy that is not as old is a much better investment.

Lastly, I was stunned to see Al Gore and Encarta used as references.  Haven't both of these sources been debunked?  Even in the 1990's, most of us knew these were not reliable sources of information.  Today, most know them to be unreliable.",1269993600,18,673,4.370967741935484
2533400,5,B000ESSTS8,"Countdown is one of the most important works on Christian prophecy.  Chuck has produced one of the major accounts of the Lords second coming and the End of Days - this is NOT fiction - this is real!  This is a great movie as well as a great work of Christian prophecy.

For a very compelling docudrama type DVD Movie on the End of Days see:

The movie is great because it shows CNN like news reports of what will happen during the End Days.
Both are well recommended.  These movies are also good to show unbelievers as it is very powerfully convincing.",1243900800,6,708,5.409090909090909
2533401,5,B000ESSTS8,"I watched this on TV last night and it was interesting and thought-provoking. Anyone who thinks the Holy Bible is not a book of prophecy should see this. It's very well done and the scriptures that accompany the commentary should cause anyone to seriously consider the truthfulness of what is stated in ""Countdown to Eternity"". It was made in 1997, so it's very old, but all you have to do is watch the news to see how accurate it is now, even from so long ago. I was thinking I'd like to see an update, but I don't know that one is needed. The Bible does not change, and what it foretells will not change. I was just at a church meeting the morning before seeing this, and we were discussing what we should study next in our group. Several people wanted to begin a study on the end times, and specifically mentioned the book of Daniel--which is quoted often in this movie. I think this movie will be part of our study. Buy it, rent it, or borrow it--but be sure to watch it.",1237680000,16,975,4.275675675675676
2533402,5,B000ESSTS8,"The ""Countdown to Eternity"" DVD gives us a very clear understanding of the signs of the times. Looking at ancient Bible prophecies, these experts explain in no uncertain terms how the events we watch on our daily news are the signs that would precede Jesus' second coming.  In my book, ""Awakening the Sleeping Giant"" (The Church and the Road to Revival), I felt compelled to dedicate one whole chapter to the end-times. This DVD has confirmed many of my own findings.

2533403,5,B000ESSTS8,"This DVD is great because it actually quotes bible verses for every ""sign"" of the last days that it talks about.  As a Christian, it made me feel excited for the return of my Lord Jesus Christ! Highly recommend this DVD.",1217030400,7,220,4.365853658536586
2533404,5,B000ESSTS8,"This is an excellent documentary which shows were our world is headed, and how world events today relate to the Bible. The speakers are Bill Gallatin, Dave Hunt, Chuck Missler, Roger Oakland and Chuck Smith. All of them do a great job of presenting the facts in this documentary, as they talk about several last days prophecies which are being fulfilled before our very eyes.",1171238400,21,375,4.7846153846153845
2533405,5,B000ESSTS8,"Everyone needs to see this DVD. No matter if you are a Christian or not.  I just saw it and it shows you all of the phrophecies that have come to pass out of the Bible.  It was made in 1997.  The world was bad back then, and seeing it in 2006 just confirms that just as fast as technology has made tremendous increase, evil in the world has done the same thing.  They are predicting that a nuclear exchange would take place in the middle east, we are now closer to that than ever.

The only book that predicts what the future holds with 100% accuracy is the Bible, Countdown to Eternity shows this beyond a shadow of a doubt.",1165363200,39,625,4.132231404958677

2533411,5,B000ESSTS8,I chose this film to learn more of  the prophecies about Israel. It most  surely presents all from the past and  those yet to come. Israel plays a major part in the 2nd coming of  Jesus so It is important for ALL Christians to know the sighs and to stay alert and ready.. I recommend it for  all 15 years old and over.

2533412,3,B000ESSTS8,"Countdown to Eternity is a relatively well-made fundamentalist Christian movie, with all the usual creative interpretations of Biblical prophecy. The time is at hand, found out why! All the usual suspects are there: the New World Order, earthquakes, the ecumenical movement, false Christs and gay activistsyou get the picture. The main difference between this production and most others of a similar kind is that Countdown accepts the reality of environmental destruction and (at least implicitly) climate change. They even quote Al Gore! Personally, I wasn't convinced. But then, I never am. Three stars for the effort.",1382227200,,620,5.46875

2533414,4,B000ESSTS8,"I have found Jim Tetlow's productions to be biblically accurate, informative, interesting, and cohesive, and ""Countdown to Eternity"" is no exception. Please don't be put off by flippant remarks or sour grapes. If you have an interest in the subject, as everyone well should have, do view this video. I gave it four stars instead of five only because the visual quality is not high. The content is current and put together very well.",1364601600,4,432,4.851351351351352

8113912,4,B000ESSTS8,The film stayed true to scripture.  I was able to gain more revelation knowledge of what will soon come to past living in this sin cursed world. I am a true believer in Jesus Christ and am waiting for His return.  This film just confirmed what I know to be the truth.  This truth set me free from all lies ungodly men would say to invalidate God's precious Word.  I appreciate all involved in making this informative film.  I pray for those who may watch this film will get saved from their sins so they may escape the damnation of hell and go to heaven to be with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.,1459209600,2,598,4.2105263157894735
