1687772,1,B0000634E6,I was very disappointed in this DVD.  I can't judge the quality as it will not even play in my DVD.  What a waste.,1332979200,4,114,3.7083333333333335
1687773,5,B0000634E6,"I've been a long time fan of Bill Blanks since way back in the day and purchased the entire series of Advanced Live back then.  Well, I'd used them so much and they've gotten to be so old that the VHS format began to wear out on many of the tapes.  I notified Tae-Bo.com, just as it seems many other fans had done, to request that the series be issued on a more reliable format - we were without success.

I looked and searched nearly where I thought was everywhere and did not think that Amazon.com would carry the series - heck, Tae-Bo.com didn't.  Well, I was wrong.  I was able to locate many of the tapes that I'd completely worn out and I am so happy!

I like the newer versions of Tae-Bo, but the Live series from the 90's are better - sorry Billy.",1316822400,,755,4.136986301369863
1687774,5,B0000634E6,"Sadly non of the workouts in this series are available as of this writing on DVD. These are some of Billy's best workouts. Pure Tae Bo, no equipment or ""Billy bands"" needed but you can add you own light hand weights or weighted gloves if you are advanced and very fit.

This is my favorite of all the Live! Advanced series of VHS's. The workout is 57 minutes of non stop standing work, no floor work. The moves are uncomplicated and easy to follow.

First 5 minutes are warmup, followed by a short stretching segment. The remainder of the workout is cardio with some core and glute-emphasis moves. Very little cooldown and post workout stretch is included, so add your own. Be prepared to sweat.

I consider this to be a low impact workout though there are a few segments of light jumping with both feet off the ground.",1306540800,,819,4.483221476510067
1687775,5,B0000634E6,"This workout is nearly 60 minutes in the following format:

Warm Up, (easy stretch and cardio): 8 min
Floor work, abs: 11 min
Floor work legs (mostly glutes and inner thighs): 10 min
Cardio section, (traditional kickbox moves): 25 min
Stretch out/cool down: 5 min

Another in the great workout series Tae Bo Advanced Live!, this volume 7 has a considerable amount of floor work in the early portion of the workout. Your glutes will be burning by the end of the floor work and the traditional Tae Bo cardio section that follows will be a welcome relief though it ends with even more bun burners.",1302739200,2,594,4.59433962264151
1687776,5,B0000634E6,"This is volume two of the Tae Bo Live video series I think this if from 1999 around thime I was just beginning to box. My one friend had it and I did it with here about a year ago. Me being a boxer I thought I was going to go through this like a knife through butter,but let me tell you the first five minutes I was struggling. First you go through a vigorous warm up you go through a good 40 minute of punching and kicking routine also added with jogging,hops,jumping jacks and killer knee lifts long with classic speed bag one of my favorites. The you go down and do killer floor work using your legs that target the glutes and thighs as well. I started doing it over and over again and know it is one of my favorite workouts. Being a boxer I love this video it is a absolute classic in my book. It is filmed live at Billy Bank`s training center. If you want a kick boxing workout challenge,try this great classic workout.",1283817600,,924,4.138888888888889

1687784,4,B0000634E6,"I wasn't expecting this to be just like the ""live"" advanced Taebo from early millennia, as I was warned by other reviewers.  However, I wasn't expecting the exact same music (consisting of a boring, monotone drum beat) as one of his other DVD's, which I believe is Taebo Max Intensity.  I did like the workout and it was fairly challenging, but it would be a more enjoyable workout by replacing that useless and boring track with some good music and have some variation in the music!",1442534400,,483,4.604651162790698
1687785,5,B0000634E6,"Good old school Tae Bo at it's finest!  I lost 100 pounds doing tae bo and have kept it off for over 10 years.  I love these old Tae Bo Live advanced workouts the best, but anything Billy Blanks does is gold, in my opinion.  The music is pumping, the moves cover every muscle group, especially abs, glutes, and thighs, and you will definitely be sweaty when it's over.  Most importantly, though, Billy gives thanks and praise to God and reminds us of how important it is to exercise our will and our faith.  Newer exercise videos are just copy cat's of Tae Bo, proving that this style of workout gets results.",1435708800,,609,4.401785714285714

The moves aren't necessarily the same as the original VHS Tae-bo Advanced, so it's taken me a little longer to pick up on the moves because they're more rhythmic I feel. Once I get the hang of it then it may actually work me out the way I want it to, but as of now I would rather just go to the gym.",1424217600,,529,3.953271028037383

1687793,4,B0000634E6,"First off, I love tae Bo! I have been following Billy off and on for over a decade. Of course m favorite stuff was his original tae bo advance on vhs. This was probably my 15th dvd in his collection. This one is very different in that it is not choreographed like the others. It is a bit sloppy and more like one of his ""live"" versions of tae Bo. It's still pretty effective. Especially cardio wise. But I still prefer the vhs followed by the bootcamp series. You will definitely have fun and sweat during this video but I don't find it as challenging as my favorites. The others provide more of an intense workout to build muscle, while this workout seems to be more strictly about cardio.",1420848000,,690,4.3565891472868215

1687801,5,B0000634E6,"I own many Tae Bo workouts. This one is up there with my favorites. There is some floor work, but it's very short. A few push ups (I HATE push ups) and some knee raises from the floor. I don't care much for those, but I'm sure my body needs it. I am thinking this video was intended to be called ""Push It"" because it's mentioned a few times throughout. The DVD is an hour in length. The warm up is fast paced. I actually sweated during the warm up. 4 minutes is cool down. In between is fast paced with few breaks. And those few breaks go by extremely fast! There is less talk in this one compared to the others. Some of the moves I don't quite have yet, but today was my first time using it. I figured as long as I'm moving it's all good. The only problem I had were a couple of the girls were a more of a distraction. They were both in black. One did the moves very well but I wish she would have put on a better top. Her saggy boobs distracted me. lol The other girl, I believe, was there to look pretty. Her make up was immaculate, hair was cute, moves were sloppy. If you're new to Tae Bo I don't suggest this one yet. You could be overwhelmed by the moves, lack of explanation of those moves and the duration and intensity. When I have a 'lazy day' I prefer the Get Amped! series.

During the workout Billy informs us that their sweat is real, no machines involved to spray 'em down with fake sweat. lol That tickled me :D",1401062400,,1428,4.045936395759718

1687804,2,B0000634E6,"Unlike regular exercise videos of today, this one has NO time bar at the bottom of the screen for you to know how far along you are, or what ""section"" you're on.

1687806,5,B0000634E6,This is one of my staple workouts. It really kicks your butt. Sometimes I hate it but that's just cause it's working!!! Some of the moves are really unique which I like and it's super fast paced so it goes by quickly.,1393200000,,217,4.190476190476191

1687809,3,B0000634E6,"I love Tae Bo.  This work out is okay but there is too much time spent on the floor.  It's okay if you're watching it from your TV but not so much from a lap top.  I do like that there is less pausing in between each routine though.  Not my favorite work out, however.  I have four DVDs and this is my least favorite.",1387238400,,317,3.8153846153846156
1687810,4,B0000634E6,"It wasn't as tough as I expected.  Yes, I did sweat and felt good afterwards, but  I like TaeBo II: Get Ripped Advanced Workout better, it was filmed in a less desired studio but I felt like it was more genuine, people were working harder and it felt less choreograph. It also made me work harder and there were less interruptions.  I felt that with this DVD that there were too many breaks and it did not feel advanced.  I think this will be great for someone who doesn't workout 5-6 days per week.
 I will continue to do this work and alternate with some of Billys older videos, and some others in my collection.",1386806400,,614,4.304347826086956
1687811,4,B0000634E6,"Billy Blanks: Tae Bo Advanced DVD is not a reissue of one of the twelve Advanced Live videos that came out when Tae Bo was at its peek of popularity.  Those Tae Bo Veterans expecting this to be the case, prepare to be slightly disappointed.

The Advanced Live series featured exhilarating music from actual artists that enhanced Billy's routine.  They were fast-paced and enjoyable.  (Hint: Reissue this series on DVD so that Tae Bo veterans that no longer have VHS players can still experience them.) This newer offering uses tinny computerized background sounds to keep the pace--not memorable.

In this 2012 version of Advanced, Billy is featured with a smaller group of participants in a martial arts setting complete with samurai swords and kanji pictogram posters.  Billy forgoes the usual warm-up and gets right into a fairly fast-paced (when compared to other ""Advanced"" Tae Bo routines) set of moves.  He relies on his ""butterfly"" side-to-side move often when he just wants to keep his company moving and he can regroup as to what to do next.  In typical Billy fashion, he does forget to do both sides at times, but as this is a cardio workout, it doesn't matter much.

This is a long DVD for those who have been conditioned by other more recent Tae Bo offerings.  Its over an hour while the others have logged in at about 45 minutes--complete with warm-up and cool-down.  There is a cool down on this DVD as well as a motivational message at the end.

Some of the moves are awkward and since this is considered 'advanced' most of the slow moves meant to teach the sequence really do not need to be executed.  Anyone who has done Tae Bo before knows what ""In and Out"" is and should be familiar with the various punches and kicks.  The constant tutelage breaks the momentum and becomes extremely frustrating once your heart rate is up.  As with other Tae Bo DVDs, I find that doing your own thing during these moments works just as well--just wish the music was more stimulating. (wondering if there was some licensing problem with the original Live series and Billy had to abandon using actual music by artists.)

Billy does throw in some more aggressive moves which, if your body isn't sweating up to this point in the session, it will be after these surprise moves.  These include jumping and throw-downs with push-ups which almost come as a departure from the rest of the exercises.

Bottom line?  Tae Bo Advanced is longer than most of the recent Tae Bo Advanced offerings.  It is a Cardio DVD, does not include a warm-up, uses less-than optimal background music, but does give you a fairly good workout.  Jumps and push-ups included.  Usual cool-down and motivational speech.  Recommended.

1687812,4,B0000634E6,I love Tae Bo and have been doing it on and off for the past 13 years. This DVD was a great workout- as usual it kicked my butt and made me sweat like crazy. If you have never done Tae Bo I would not recommend it as it is advanced. For Basic users this will definiey be tough bit worth it. Billy does seem a little grouchy through out this one though so I think he may be tougher than usual.,1377475200,,391,3.7804878048780486
1687813,3,B0000634E6,"I think that this video was originally meant to be called 'Tae Bo Push It' but was probably re-branded as the 'Advanced' to sell more copies. It is fast-paced and will make you sweat, but a lot of the moves are awkward and don't flow well together. There are a few exercises in this video where only one side of the body is worked on. I don't plan to use this video very much, as I didn't feel energized like I usually do with Billy's workouts. I'll be sticking with 'Tae Bo Cardio Explosion' and the original VHS 'Tae Bo Advanced' workout for my weekly routine.",1375056000,,562,4.311320754716981

I have 7 of his workout videos and rotate them on a daily basis.  The Taebo advanced is definitely one of my favorites -- it has a few new combinations that I haven't seen in the others so that definitely is a plus.  All in all - I definitely feel like I've worked out after completely this.,1374192000,,439,4.069767441860465

1687816,4,B0000634E6,"My only complaint is this being called advanced, we do not need to have all the slow motion of how to do the routines.  While better than a lot of the various Tae Bo workouts in this area, I don't think they are needed at all.  Most of the people who buys these have done more than a couple of them and hence know how to do the routines.  It does give you a chance to catch your breath if you need it but would prefer to move right from one to another without a break.  Billy of course needs to stop talking so much, but that is a given in any of these workouts, the only motivation it gives me is to turn off the sound.",1371686400,,620,3.858267716535433

1687824,4,B0000634E6,"I enjoy Tae Bo workouts very much. Billy Blanks' system is one of the best for me in getting in shape and losing weight. I have purchased several Tae Bo workouts for rotational purposes, and so have tried several. So here's the scoop on this DVD:

Tae Bo: Advanced is part of the Tae Bo live series and probably a year or two into the series at that. Do not confuse this workout with the advanced workout from the original Tae Bo series. As Tae Bo workouts go, this is a pretty decent workout. The tempo is fast, movement is constant. One thing I enjoyed about this workout is that the moves had more repetition, and at the pace Billy moves in this workout, you really do get a workout. Most advanced workouts have an intense cardio and muscular power move. In this case, we have a combo of squatted, backwards knee lunges and push-ups. Ugh. It will take some time to get this move down.

Over all, I enjoyed this workout and will most likely add it to my rotation of Tae Bo workouts. The pace is quick, the moves repetitive, stamina is definitely needed. The video quality is not that great. It is reminiscent of being transferred to DVD. Sound quality is comparable. Not for those expecting clear-cut resolution. Recommended for Tae Bo users with Upper Basic to Advanced experience and for those looking for a descent workout.",1360368000,2,1328,4.529166666666667

1687826,4,B0000634E6,This is a great workout. More difficult than some of the other workouts he has. More jumping as well. I have about 17 taebo videos and i do taebo about 4 days per week.,1359504000,10,168,3.9705882352941178
1687827,5,B0000634E6,"I own several Tae Bo videos, and this one was one of my favorites. It does not seem to be as advanced as I thought it would be. He does have some new combinations. It is a fun and effective workout. The part that I don't like is the push ups. I am not crazy about ever doing push ups. I really like the pace of this workout. It goes much faster than his other workouts. He does fewer reps before the explosion of the move. Overall, great purchase.",1356912000,14,447,4.033707865168539
1687828,5,B0000634E6,"Last year, I got into the whole Tae Bo thing and I now own several workouts on DVD and a few on VHS. After not exercising for several months, I have jumped back into my Tae Bo workouts. When I saw that Tae Bo Advanced was being released, I eagerly pre-ordered it.

The new workout uses the same old set and participants from the most recent Tae Bo releases. This an advanced workout, so there is no stretching as you jumps into the workout at a faster pace than normal. Most of the typical moves are here, with the addition to a few new ones, some change ups and new combos.

I started to sweat about ten-minutes into the workout and was soaked from head to toe by the end.

Is it as good as the old advanced workouts?

All I can say is that it has a different routine than what the others had.

This workout is excellent for those who don't have time to drive to the gym everyday, people trying to save money, or even people who are trying their best to lose weight but might feel a little self-conscious. Some of the prices are great for this product and will save tons of money in the long run considering that most gym memberships can cost anywhere from $10-$80 a month. Tae-bo live volume 1 gives a full packed arm and leg workout in the comfort of a television screen, without the customer making too many financial sacrifices. I recommend this product to anyone trying to work out legs and arms.",1342224000,,905,4.6625

Please respond. Thanks Eguires",1518393600,,306,4.865384615384615
7958551,5,B0000634E6,"I think this is a great workout.  It has the butterfly move, roundhouse kick,  knee raises, push ups, they go from slow to fast. They even do some jumps up and down. I really found a winner routine. You will have a downpour of sweat when you do this workout.  When you put the dvd in , get ready to really work.",1496188800,,311,3.9838709677419355

7958553,5,B0000634E6,"When I began doing Tae Bo in 2002, I weighed over 230 pounds and was in very poor health.  I had just had my first baby and I wanted to get in shape to be an active, energetic mom.  Tae Bo was the answer to my prayers.  I lost over 100 pounds in two years and I didn't really change my diet that much, I just did Tae Bo nearly everyday.  After eight years of doing Tae Bo live advanced, I had totally wore out my Tae Bo video library and the VHS tapes were getting tore up in the old VCR.  So, I decided to start running and doing other workout programs for several years.  Big Mistake!  Nothing gives me the overall results as doing Tae Bo.  I began searching for the old original Tae Bo Live Advanced workouts on VHS last year and now I'm back to doing Tae Bo nearly everyday.  Through the awesome teaching and motivation that only Billy Blanks can give, Tae Bo has transformed my body and my mind.  My waist is tight, my abs are toned, my thighs look like Daisy Dukes'.  If you've never done Tae Bo before, you have to go through the instructional video and basic workout a few times to work on your technique.  Every Tae Bo workout is a little bit different, Billy keeps you wondering what's coming next.  However, every Tae Bo workout gives you the same awesome feeling at the end:  energized, focused, victorious, ready to take on your day.  Other workouts may come and go, but for me, It's Tae Bo forever!",1465171200,2,1412,4.235955056179775

7958556,5,B0000634E6,"I just got back into cardio a couple of months ago and resurrected my tae-bo DVD's and decided to buy a few more. I absolute LOVE this DVD. It's pretty hard and it gets your heart pumping and the sweat pouring which is good. Since using this along with the Get Ripped II and his boot camp 4 days a week I have been losing inches.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good, tough workout.",1456876800,,415,4.1875
