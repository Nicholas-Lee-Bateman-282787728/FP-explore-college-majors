8677038,5,B00NAXE9ZG,"Can't beat 100 films for this price.  Yeah a lot of them are B or even C roll films, but for the few of them I really wanted it's more than worth the cost.  The kids love most of them and I love the nostalgia.  Only downside was spending hours ripping them to my media server (I don't want to be swapping DVDs all day).  Would be nice to see collections like these being sold digitally.  I mean you can sometimes find them in not-so-legal ways, but I don't mind paying for them if the price is right and the delivery method is decent.",1492819200,2,534,4.096153846153846

8677040,2,B00NAXE9ZG,"Recently, some companies have started releasing dvds which are compressed, and looks more like VHS. Mill Creek is one of the most prolific. The easiest way to notice is to see there are 20 discs and over 8000 minutes in this set - over 400 minutes per one dvd!. 'Full quality' dvds (which are still compressed, of course, compared to the original film but are nevertheless much higher quality) typically have 150-200 minutes per disk. Anything over 300 is low quality, and over 400 is really low. You have been warned. Of course, the set is very cheap, so perhaps you will be ok with the lower quality - just know what you are getting.",1464739200,10,635,4.530434782608696
8677041,5,B00NAXE9ZG,"Great set! Love these films and it is so nice to have a collection of some classic films and some that I had never seen. Five separate DVD categories that have really delightful films with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, Abbot & Costello!",1462665600,3,232,4.4186046511627906
