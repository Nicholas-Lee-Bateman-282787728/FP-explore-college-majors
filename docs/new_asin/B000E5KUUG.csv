8106271,4,B000E5KUUG,Very informative.,1460851200,,17,8.0
8106272,5,B000E5KUUG,Very happy with this video. It is very detailed and clear. I recommend this to anyone looking to rebuild a 4L60E transmission.,1421020800,,126,4.7727272727272725
8106273,5,B000E5KUUG,"My only curiosity is to find out if there have been any refinements made to the 4L60E in the last ten years since this video was done. I love the concept, and am anxious to watch it. The other reviews were positive, and judging by Rick's credentials, it should be a very good video.",1420934400,,282,4.2407407407407405
8106274,4,B000E5KUUG,"Fast delivery, good packing. I watched this video and it seems pretty comprehensive.",1413158400,,84,5.538461538461538
8106275,5,B000E5KUUG,"The whole video shows in two hours how to do a six hour job.  Be ready to pause and replay a lot.

The picture is clear and the video is well made.  The camera views are well orchestrated to show the different components, how they work and how to inspect them.  This was my only resource during my rebuild and my 4L60E now has 500 miles after the rebuild so I got it right the first try.  I decided not to buy the ATSG after watching this video and seeing how easy it is to work on the 4L60E.

I understand that since this is a professional video that the use of specialized tools is expected but the only special tool I used in my rebuild is a universal spring compressor.  I installed and resized the teflon rings with heavy plastic sheet and hose clamps. I also removed the pump with a large screwdriver.

The only omission in the video is the removal and replacement of all the bushings.  Only the pump bushings and case bushing are addressed by the video. I have been told that most rebuilds do not replace every bushing in the transmission but it is something I wanted to do.",1389398400,4,1081,4.259803921568627
