8276368,1,B000VU9W58,This DVD is 10 minutes long and either shouldn't be for sale or it should only be $5.  I am disappointed with Amazon for offering it.,1232323200,,133,4.115384615384615
8276369,2,B000VU9W58,"I bought this $15 video as I LOVED Lucca, Italy.  Truly one of the nicest places on Earth...but only found out as I started watching it....that it is only 10 MINUTES long!  What a disappointment.  The quality of the show is not that good and doesn't show the true beauty of Lucca.  I would not recommend this video and plan on returning it....but come on, TEN MINUTES?  What a joke!",1199664000,3,382,4.4
