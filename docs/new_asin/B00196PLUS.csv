8591630,1,B00196PLUS,"Incorrect facts. The CBS 60 Minute presentation choose to sensationalize the complex issue of combustible dust in the manufacturing workplace with the vivid video footage of facilities on fire after an combustible dust explosion.

Instead of the headline ""350 factory explosions"" since 1980 which the Chemical Safety Board has underreported and admitted in their 2006 Dust Hazard Study disclaimer. The correct statement should be 350 combustible dust fires and explosions, not solely explosions.

Combustible dust fires can have a devastating economic impact to a community with the loss of a facility. Additionally, according to U.S. Census Bureau data there are over 100,000 manufacturing firms (NAICS) that are at risk, not 30,000. Furthermore, a bipartisan majority in the House voted to force OSHA to impose new safety rules for combustible dust never occurred. Only 10% of Republicans voted for the bill. Is that a bipartisan majority?

The gloves will come off in the Senate and the President already stated he will veto the bill. Why were no representatives from the manufacturing industry interviewed? This is very biased report and does not provide the public with a true picture of the complex issue concerning combustible dust incidents.
