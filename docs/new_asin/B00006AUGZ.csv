7966725,1,B00006AUGZ,"I was looking for data or an overview (hopefully educational) and would have been happy with some footage (or ""reportage"") but there's really NOTHING here. Besides reeking of Department of Defense production (ie propaganda) with some irritating music, there is absolutely not one snippet of information about our military operations, the status of the Afghani people or government, the results, the why, the when, or anything. A few gurbles of how great we are, but that's it. Personally, I wanted to know where the oil lines were being protected by U.S. troops, if it was true that we dropped ""Daisy Cutters"" on Afghani troop concentrations and so on.
The back cover also promises ""battle footage"" of which there is none. They are referring to a scene at the end in which some U.S. troops hear gunshots and can't determine if they are the ones being shot at. The scene ends with our guys ducking and exiting, roll credits: DOD.",1056326400,15,928,4.8427672955974845
7966726,5,B00006AUGZ,"This is a great look at what our fighting men and women of the United States Forces did and are doing to protect our Freedom in the face of Terror after September 11. The detail and in your face coverage really makes you feel what it is like on the front lines. Artisan really did a superb job in this very well put together and crisp presentation. My only complaint is the length of the DVD. It is just over an hour, and the film makers did such a good job, the film really leaves you wanting more. But other then that you couldn't ask for much more. ""you can't go wrong picking up this great documentary"".",1034035200,11,607,4.196581196581197
