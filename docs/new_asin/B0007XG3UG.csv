8053459,4,B0007XG3UG,"A matchup of soon to be college football coaching legends, Bobby Bowden and Barry Switzer, in a rematch of the previous season's Orange Bowl. An oddity here is Bob Trumpy, as a sideline reporter, being allowed to interview players during the game. To this observer, it became quite annoying.
This is the complete telecast without commercial interruption. There is no pregame, halftime, or postgame. The picture quality varies with this one. Field level shots are of excellent quality. The press box shot is good. Not great, but good. It lacks the clarity, the sharpness displayed in other game dvd's of this series. Overall though, for a JANUARY 1, 1981 telecast, anyone should be pleased with it.",1485734400,,697,5.017241379310345
