8135057,5,B000GY71I4,"Your illustrated lecture is very well done. You clearly demonstrate the relativity of map construction, how a particular projection relates to its intended use. You show cartographers as real people who have specific goals in mind. Their pictures and your comments about them feed into your ""empowerment"" sub-theme--that change comes because individuals (maybe even when young and alone) take initiatives. Further, I appreciate allowing teachers to make copies of the video/DVD. One of my frustrations when teaching was finding effective materials that were not prohibitively expensive and/or restricted.
