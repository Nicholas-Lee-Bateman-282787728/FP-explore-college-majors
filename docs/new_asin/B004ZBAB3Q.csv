4506834,3,B004ZBAB3Q,"I wish that Disney would make the Blu-ray available by it self, i love the option of having thew movies on DVD also but I don't need 2 copies of this movie, one is enough and I don't understand why the only way to get the blu-ray is in the combo- pack. Please Disney un-combo the blu-ray disks!!",1312416000,2,295,4.103448275862069
4506835,5,B004ZBAB3Q,I received my copy of this last week and have to say the picture clarity is better than before. Having both films in one package is a great marketing point because you get them both for less than the cost of buying both of them separately. You won't be disappointed!,1309219200,5,266,4.34
4506836,4,B004ZBAB3Q,"I received my copy of the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack of Disneys The Fox and The Hound. It is one Blue Ray disc and two DVD discs. They contain the following:

Disc 1 (Blu-ray):
The Fox and the Hound 30th Anniversary
The Fox and the Hound II
Bonus: Unlikely Friends

Disc 2 (DVD):
The Fox and the Hound 30th Anniversary
Bonus: Passing the Baton: Making of
Bonus: Best of Friends Sing-along

Disc 3 (DVD):
The Fox and the Hound II
Bonus: Making of the Music
Bonus: You Know I Will music video

I really enjoyed the original film and found the colors and sharpness of the Blu-ray very acceptable. It almost looks like it was made yesterday and not 30 years ago. In fact, I think it looks better than when I saw it at the cinema in 1981! Sound was also very good and I had no problems. I let the kids watch the sequel and while they enjoyed it, I must admit I only saw bits and pieces of it. While it was nice to see the characters in a new story, I am not into the sequels of most films.

I am going to hold onto my previous edition of the 25th Anniversary Edition on DVD. It contains an Art Gallery that is sadly not included in this 30th Anniversary Edition. Also missing are the bonus shorts and games.

It is good to see Disney remastering and putting their films on both DVD and Blu-ray formats. I highly recommend this classic of Disney animation.",1308355200,8,1346,4.23828125

It does get a bit slow at times, but it kept my 3.5 yr old daughter's attention even so!

The bluray looked fine to me; I didn't expect too much given the age of the source material. I'm not expert nor a videophile; I had no complaints, though, on the quality of the video or audio given my expectations.",1419897600,,563,3.982300884955752

4507271,3,B004ZBAB3Q,"Disney Studios 24th full length animated feature film. The Fox and the Hound is another decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with some familiar voice work and great animation. the new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.

While this isn't Disney at it's best it is an enjoyable and pretty solid film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone but not quite as polished as it is in Jungle Book. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Jungle Book, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process.. a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the new Blu Ray and all have their good points and bad points. the first release and second  editions were released in full screen so it is nice to see the film presented on the new Blu Ray is 1:66:1 which is a step in the right direction. The film feels cramped at times (not sure if 1:75:1 was the original theatrical ratio, but is what is stated in the original press book?) and once again the Blu Ray while an improvement, it shows signs of what I think are cell related issues. The films looks great in some shots and in other scenes appears soft and out of focus, then back to clear and beautiful a few frames later. I don't know if I can lay all the blame on Disney this time, but it is clear this film and many other are not receiving the same treatment films like Snow White did. It's understandable though, it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and Disney by this time was all about profit. Also, this film may not have been cared for like the early classics. Who knows how these lesser know, less successful films were stored? I don't know this film well enough to know how it should look, but this could be the problem with some scenes looking out of focus and why some dark scenes and the blacks seem to have no detail.. Still overall it looks very good and it is better than the previous releases.

The direct to video sequel The Fox and the Hound 2, I'll start off by stating that I am not a collector of these direct to video sequels, so I'm not the best judge of it, I am generally not impressed with any of them and The Fox and the Hound 2 is no exception. I would rather have some quality extras and a better restoration than this sequel, but it does look great on Blu Ray.

 It would be nice if Disney would include multiple formats on the newer releases as the extras are thin and there is room for them. It would also let buyers have more options for playback. The restoration looks decent, but because of the style of animation and the Xerography process the rough lines seem a little too rough for my taste in some areas, although not nearly as prominent in this film.  I prefer the earlier films over the films from 1961-1981. These films seem to be missing some of Walt's magic.

If you must own Disney's The Fox and the Hound, is the Blu Ray is the way to go?...probably, but there should have been more care taken to make the film more consistent and the extras are embarrassingly bad, no stills gallery again!( only on Gold edition) and not even a making of for the film! For a studio who prides themselves as pioneers in animation and the best animation at that, you would think they would put some effort into the bonus material even if it isn't there greatest achievement. The addition of the direct to video sequel is a plus for those who want it, but I would rather have had the extra care and even a short making of for the original film in place of it.  They should also have included multiple formats on the films from 1961 to 1986 because there are those films seem to have been shown in multiple formats in theaters, there is room for them on the disc so why not give fans what they complain about time and time again.",1385424000,,4364,4.3711467324291

4507320,5,B004ZBAB3Q,"When I watched this movie, I was only around 3-4 years old. I didn't understand a lot of the elements this movie featured. Back then it wasn't my favorite though however, now I'm watching it as an adult and I understand more of this movie and it quickly rose to my #1 movie. The element of friendship is displayed in a way that adults can understand and kids can love. Watching this now I can fully relate to this movie and it's emphasis on friendship. It tells a story of two animals destined to be enemies but in the end their bond as friends is too strong. Even though they can't be together, as they grow up they know they're still friends and always will be. I have a relationship like that and even though my best friend and I parted ways a few years ago, I know we're still friends and 20 years could go by but the friendship will still be there. Friends are a part of you and this movie tells that story in the best way possible.

The characters are well thought out and well drawn. They're funny and lovable and smart. They voice actors really bring them to life and the art style fits perfectly. I read a lot of reviews complaining about the art still looking old even in 1080p and I'll admit there are parts like that, but please realize the film they had to work with is from 1981. There's only so much disney can do to a film that old. This is definitely a must for any house and at this price I'm surprised you haven't clicked buy yet!",1367020800,,1449,4.212230215827338

It looks okay to stunning at times but definitely needs more work in restoration and it deserved more. The themes of friendship and redemption are quite powerful in this film and it has always kind of moved me. There are many inconsistencies and even some print damage that is annoying with this one. Including an awful sequel on the same disc does not make this better. I give the first film five stars but am reluctant for anybody to buy this at more than 10-15 bucks.

The animation was good for the time, considering it was at a time when Disney was still trying to find it's direction after the loss of Walt.  The acting is decent, and the characters have enough time to really develop.  Unfortunately for this version of the film, it comes packaged with the sequel that was released several years after the original.  This is one of the terrible sequels that came out that was more of a side story to the original film than a stand alone film.  The story is awful, the acting is ok I guess, and the animation is decent.  If I could rate it seperately I'd probably rate it at one star, just because it ruins the first film.

Why was a sequel made for it?  NO CLUE  Disney ran out of idea, so they rehashed moderately successful films?  I have never seen the sequel & now that I have it in my hands per this package I am NOT going to change my mind about it.

The music fit the film, did NOT stand out as songs you will remember years later.
Now, for this package.  The blu ray has BOTH FILMS ON IT  If you are a fan & looking for extras-do NOT look at the blu ray disc.

Now, each film has a separate plain, silver DVD disc.  The DVD's have better extras than the blu ray?  Does this make sense, NO.  What were you thinking Disney.

4507407,1,B004ZBAB3Q,"***SPOILER ALERT*** Based on all of these positive reviews, I got ""The Fox and the Hound"" for my daughters to watch. They are 6 and 8. We only got through two-thirds of it, and they were both distraught and sobbing, so I turned it off. What the heck is the matter with Disney??? First, the baby fox's mother is killed. OK, I know that he needs to get adopted for the plot to be set in motion, but this is a movie for little children. Do they need to see a baby's mother shot (off camera, but still?) The baby fox ('Tod') is adopted and bottle-fed by a kindly elderly woman named Tweed. Her neighbor, Slade, owns a hunting dog ('Chief') and a new puppy. Tod and the baby hound ('Copper,') become fast friends and frolic relentlessly together. Eventually the fox gets viciously chased by Chief. Slade, who is mean and brutal, shoots up all the scenery, even taking aim at Tweed and shooting right at her (the camera gives us Slade's perspective as he shoots with her head in his sights.) It's unbelievably violent. Later Copper gets taken away to be taught to hunt by his abusive owner (""I better go, he really sounds mad"") and the two friends are separated. The kindly owl then explains to Copper that he can't be friends with a hound, and shows him a shed full of skinned pelts (""how horrible,"" says the baby fox. Indeed. My daughter cried, ""is one of those HIS MOTHER?"") When the dogs come home from their long winter's hunt, the now-grown fox tries to reconnect with his friend. This results in him being hunted by both dogs and their owner, a long and terrifying chase scene that results in Chief (the older dog) being hit and killed by a train (we see the train hit him from his perspective, as if the train is hitting us.) Copper and his owner blame Tod and vow revenge (huh? how is Chief's accidental death Tod's fault when they were trying to chase him down and kill him?) On top of this absurdly nasty plot, the characters are mostly either obnoxious or irritating. The only really sympathetic characters are Tweed and the owl ('Big Mama'.) Tod, although sweet, is blithe and naive; he won't listen to Copper when he asks him to not bother Chief, or when he warns him to stay away or they'll both be in trouble. A side plot involves two birds trying to hunt down and kill a cute little caterpillar called Squeak. How is that funny? They are trying to KILL him. The whole production is totally tone-deaf. It's like Disney has no idea that murder and death are not subjects that you liberally sprinkle throughout an animated movie for young children. And to have Copper turn on his best friend and try to hunt him down to be killed--it's creepy. It's not like the usual ""cartoon violence;"" that type of violence is funny because it's obviously unreal and absurd. This movie is realistic. When a character is shot or hit by a train they die. On top of all of that, the editing, sound, script and acting are second rate all the way (Mickey Rooney, a 58-year-old man, plays Tod; he's supposed to be a barely-grown fox. It sound jarringly odd.) Even the animation isn't fully up to the usual Disney standards; there's some jerkiness to some of the scenes, and several times the animation looked startlingly amateur (the caterpillar's face, the bigger bird's hair after he is accidentally electrocuted.) My kids hated this movie. My 8-year-old asked me if it was rated PG-13. When I told her it was rated G, she said she thought it should be rated ""S,"" for sad, or for stupid. I agree.",1336694400,7,3486,4.5086887835703005

Also with Disney starting to make all their movies in 3D I wanted to wait but if it says going into the vault then I don't want to have to wait 10 years to buy it again let alone if they actually do come out with a 3D edition.

New: found out on the 2nd dvd disk it skips/pauses at 1 part (not a huge deal) but seriously, I paid for a new movie, it should NOT be skipping the first time I use it.  The 1st dvd seems to be fine however it is not Disney best ""remaster""",1333238400,,767,3.608433734939759

4507412,5,B004ZBAB3Q,"Would be 5 stars based on the original movie alone. However, I had to deduct something for what is in this set.

When you see 3 disc you assume it will be:

A Blu-ray of the original

A Blu-ray of the sequel

A DVD with both on one

Well it's the other way around!

You get:

A Blu-ray with both on one

A DVD for the original

A DVD for the sequel

I don't notice that the picture quality suffers any, but it's not what I expected with a Disney release. I have always been very impressed with their Blu-ray releases. I really appreciate that they give you the DVD with just about all of them, but I am buying the Blu-ray not the DVD. The DVD is just a bonus. Disney doesn't seem to treat this classic as well as others, and it's a shame. It should be one of their most cherished. I know it is for me.

-An unrelated humorous observation-

I am confused as to why Disney has DVD/Blu-ray versions that come in a DVD case. Who is that for? Are there people so ashamed they have a Blu-ray player that they disguise their Blu-rays as DVDs? Maybe to match with the DVDs they already have? Isn't it their goal to get us to upgrade those too? They are the only movie company I've seen that does this. Isn't it odd?

My daughter got Cars 2 DVD/Blu-ray for her birthday. She couldn't wait to see it so it got opened. Sure, it looks good next to her Cars DVD, but I intend to upgrade it to Blu-ray eventually, and I always get her the Blu-ray package. So, Cars 2 will be her only Pixar/Disney movie she has in a DVD case? Great... Thanks Disney, for giving her technology illiterate grandma opportunity to make a mistake. Well at least she got the Blu-ray part right, eh? :-P",1332028800,,1665,4.165625

4507418,4,B004ZBAB3Q,"I always held a special place in my heart for this film. Its adorable characters were too much to take, and it was a great tale of friendship. It's sad how Disney chooses not to acknowledge this film much. What does it get? A stuffed animal in the Disney Store? Not even a mug, or pens. Just, recently, plush toys. It isn't like many Disney films. If you are a die hard fan of recent Disney, Disney Renaissance, and the classics, then you may not find it....to your liking. The film has some magic from Classic Disney, but, as it was in the odd years of Disney, it has that feel of a transgression for the studio.

Disney brings this wonderful film to blu ray, and, as i said, Disney doesn't acknowledge the film too much. Maybe that's why is didn't get a pristine conversion, but a good one. The colors are vibrant, lines visibly drawn, but there are problems. One problem that is most easily noticed is the fact that in certain shots, the drawn lines appear blurred. Now, i don't know if this was a mistake in conversion, or if the film itself is plagued with those problems indefinitely, but they are there....and they are noticeable. The most pointed ""issue"" is a line that appears far, far right on the picture. Trust me, unless you aren't paying attention to the movie, you should barely notice this. it comes, goes, but it's barely seen if you don't look.

Beside these issues, the blu ray conversion is good. Do I feel this is the best this film can look? Probably not. But this is what we have, what Disney gave us...either get it or hope for a better conversion.

Now, I did not bother to watch the cheapquel. I know I won't like it, so I see no point. I wish Disney had given us the choice whether we wanted to buy it, but, alas, they didn't. Hopefully, in a later re-release they will spare us. The fact that it's name is on the cover does bother me, but the happiness that I own the original is stronger than the hate.

If you are a fan, buy it; if not, maybe wait....not sure.",1324080000,15,1990,4.327077747989276

Video-quality wise, it's not Disney's best remaster though it's a definate upgrade from previous releases. There are
parts with inconsistent contrast issues leading to small but noticeable color palette changes, on and off
brightness that dims then lights up along with occasional softness.
It's  a release though that was asking for more, especially from Disney who must understand they have a great number of fans who collect all there animated films,hence the arguement of numbered spines.
One would question why they do this as older film releases like Snow White etc - have been of such a perfect upgrade to the standard of Blu-Ray we expect every time from Disney.
Now for the sound, Mastered in DTS-HD MA, What can I say this isn't a film where you really notice the upgrade until the end part but it's still a welcomed upgrade.
I personally am glad though to finally own this movie - it could look better. It's obviously not Disney's most proud classic but it doesn't deserve this condition of ""restoration"" (and something tells me they won't bother remastering this anytime soon). If one chooses to overlook or accept the aged visual flaws that could have been cleaned up, it's still a pleasant upgrade. I only wish this practise is not continued by Disney and they treat there fans with more respect as we are already double and treble dipping as it's the norm with Dvd remastered , Blu-Ray and now 3D Blu-Ray.",1319587200,,2019,5.555194805194805

Seriously, think about how many times you've seen it before in other kids movies (Bambi, Dumbo, Nemo, Tarzan, Land Before Time #1, Ice Age #1, etc). It unfairly plays on the worst fear most children have in life. It's nothing but a cheap, tear-jerking technique designed to emotionally break down children watching the film, and manipulate them into focusing their undivided attention on the rest of the film. Personally, I think it is pathetic and I'm sick of the ""dead mother"" films, young children do not need to be unfairly upset in such a manner. I avoid letting my kids watch these movies and I think its time that we as parents, send movie makers a message by boycotting such movies that feature this crap (Disney is not the only offender). Don't get me wrong, I generally love Disney movies (we own the majority of them on DVD) and I will continue to buy them, but the ""dead mother"" ones need to go.

Other than owning it in HD, fans get nothing new for what is one of the few classic feeling Disney films from this particular era. They couldn't have done a retrospective, a new featurette or had some film critic or Disney employee do a commentary? Why couldn't they have thrown together a Cine-explore. I would understand if Disney released these films again and again all the time but when you aim to only rerelease a film on new format every so many years apart you should really include something new for fans.

I'm also sort of upset as a purist that I have to own the sequel, which I thought might be okay but couldn't even sit through one viewing, but I do understand this is beneficial to others and will suck it up. Still, if you're packaging two movies together to try and maximize sales you could still toss buyers a bone with a new featurette or at least a commentary. They haven't even thrown in any new unseen concept art or relatively cheap material to include.

I'm from Portugal (Europe) and I collected all the USA Editions of the Disney classics through the years first because the covers are really more beautiful than the European versions, second because I hate the PAL speed up (The Lion King on VHS for example it's awful - it looks like it is running in fast forward compared to the audio CD soundtrack) and third because there is always more special features in the Region 1 DVDs than the Region 2 ones.

Could anyone tell me if the 1,85:1 refers to the 1st movie or the 2nd in the BLU-RAY edition? Thanks.",1314835200,3,794,4.5524475524475525
4507468,4,B004ZBAB3Q,"Note: Due to my strong disliking and disgust for all Disney DTV cheapquels, I won't review or mention the one that is included in this set. The only thing that I can say is that I hope this practice won't become the standard for subsequent Disney films because it just downgrades the overall package. With just being said, now I will proceed to review the original film.

The Fox and the Hound was a movie that changed everything in Disney's animation department. All the legendary nine old men has retired or were involved for a limited time in the producion of this film. Most of it, went to the new guard, a guard that included Glen Keane, John Musker, Ron Clements and many others (inlcuding Tim Burton and John Lasseter). This guys have become as legendary as the nine old men in the animation world, but back then they were just the newcomers. TFATH was plagued with problems. Animator Don Blunth left Disney and took half of the animators with him and the animation department wasn't the success that had been when Walt Disney was still alive. When the movie was released in 1981 was a modest success and since then it has grown in popularity but it's still not as appreciated as the early Disney classics or the ones that were released in the 90s.

The Fox and the Hound tells the story of Tod and Copper a fox and a hound (obviously) who become friends while they are young but their friendship is challenged when they are adults. The story is darker than many other animated films and resembles Bambi in many parts (although it's not as good as that one). Even though, this film is very endearing and enyojable and has many touching moments. Also it was the first Disney film without a proper happy ending and the effort of doing a satisfying finale is aprecciated. The animation is really good especially the scene where they fight the bear. That scene is impressive. All in all, The Fox and the Hound may not be an instant classic as othe Disney films are but it's one or their better efforts and deserves to be seen by any animation lover.

Video & Audio:
The case claims that the movie has been given a new digital restoration and while I don't doubt that, I do doubt that it was a complete restoration. The Fox and the Hound is not the best looking Disney blu-ray and it clearly shows some imperfections. The most jarring one is the appearance of a line in the right corner of the screen that comes and goes as it pleases. While is distracting, it's not as distracting as many others have said. Also there are some scenes that appear really soft and some artifatcs appear now and then.
On the positive side, the movie appears for the first time in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1 widescreen. That alone is a reason for joy but the also the colors are well reproduced, detail is trong and contrast is sharp. Make no mistake, this is the best that The Fox and the Hound has looked on home video but I suspect that a little more effort would have made it look even better.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is more pleasing than its video counterpart and while is front heavy, the sound is smoother, the dialogue is clear and overall delivers a good experience.

Bonus Features:
This is the most dissapointing part of the disc. The BD just comes with one extra: ""Unlikely Friends"" a featurette that explains how many animals that are supposed to be enemies are friends in the real world. While is fun to watch it, I really expect something better for a set that says ""30th Anniversary Edition"". The DVD that is included comes with two extras:""Passing the Batton"" is a short featurette of how TFATH signaled a change in Disney and many people involved talked about their experiences in the film. The other extra is a sing along of the song ""Best of Friends"". To add insult to injury, I can't believe that the DVD actually has a better extra than the BD. Very dissapointing.

Closing Thoughts:
The Fox and the Hound is a little movie that has an endearing story, nice characters and good messages. It deserves a better reputation that the one it has and also deserves to be watched (at least once). Disnet BD set offers an adequate albeit imperfect release with solid but not perfect video and good audio. The most dissapointing part is the lack of bonus features (and the inclusion of something that hardly qualifies as a ""movie""). Anyway with all it's pros and cons, this release is recommended on the strengths of the film.",1314576000,2,4425,4.538847117794486

4507470,4,B004ZBAB3Q,"My wife has been collecting the Blu-ray releases of Disney classics as they have released and this release has been no different. But something is missing in this translation, it seems that Disney didn't put their A team on this product, while you can tell it was remastered and can certainly tell the difference in picture quality, its not a solid state of quality. At times it looks AMAZING at others it just looks upgraded. while I don't know why this is, maybe something happen to the master source during remastering and is the cause but, we have Pinocchio on Blu-ray which is a far older movie and it's just Jaw-dropping on Blu-ray. If you're a fan of ""The Fox and the Hound"" this is a definite pick-up but if you happen to be a nitpicky about how your movies look and are expecting just the absolute best, especially from Disney you might want to hold off to see if they actually remaster the remaster.",1314144000,,909,4.515151515151516
4507471,5,B004ZBAB3Q,"The child actors of the '80s who voiced young Tod and young Copper in Disney's The Fox and the Hound have continued their separate careers and moved in varying directions, much as their animated counterparts. I spoke with Keith Coogan--who has had a long and successful career as an adult as well as a child--about the film, his legendary grandfather and his co-star.

GREG: Have you watched The Fox and the Hound over the years since its first release in the '80s?

KEITH: I have probably watched it once every five years or so. This one [on Blu-ray] is just unbelievably beautiful.  Sounds great, looks terrific.  Thank you Disney for my copy.  So yeah, I have watched it over the years and always from a different kind of point of view.  Just like when you watch E.T.  First you will identify with Elliot, then you will identify with the older brother, then you identify with the mom, then you wind up identifying with Peter Coyote.  Well the same with The Fox and the Hound.  I appreciated the Sandy Duncan role as I grew older, I appreciated more of the story as I matured. And when I watch, I can forget I was even a part of it because they put it together so great and it is such a strong story. Anytime I need a good cry I would pop in The Fox and the Hound!

G:  But that is a ""good"" kind of sad.  It is important for kids to learn compassion.

K: Yeah.  That is such a message of the movie.  When you're a kid, you are class blind, you are color blind. That innocence is what they are layering over, and that optimism--""we will always be friends forever, won't we?""  ""Yeah, forever.""  Then it turns out not to be the case and why and that always brings a tear to my eye.

G: The production was a bit bumpy according to the history books, but The Fox and the Hound is especially noted because it blended the work of veteran and new animators.

K: I'm very proud to be part of a Disney classic and I love that animators and fans alike see it as a crossover picture from the old to the new. It took a while to make and they stretched the voice recording over several years. I remember seeing the ""pencil"" version of the bear attack and the waterfall.  Terrifying.  Unbelievable. They had all the sound, everything in it but they hadn't animated that sequence yet and it was still very intense, very frightening.

G: Were you and Corey Feldman (who voiced Copper) already friends?

K: They recorded us separate but I had known Corey Feldman and we had worked together. We were definitely cohorts and friends.  I would be done with my session and I would see him come in with his mom, maybe we had some on-set school together a little bit.

G: Was doing the voice a challenge as a child actor?

Not being able to act with my eyes and my body was a loss. I had never done voice over before. So the process was just they were explaining, ""Okay, these are the two birds and you are really grossed out by the worm and you say `Yeecch.'"" Some times I would just give a one-line reading, other times they would try a bunch of different options.  It was basically easy, probably three sessions total for a period of two years or so. Then when the film came out, I was just blown away.  You wouldn't have known that Corey and I weren't working together or in the same room.

G: In the film, you're credited as Keith Mitchell. Did you change it to honor your grandfather, Jackie Coogan?

K: My stage name is Keith Coogan. Before my grandfather passed away in 1984, my work was under Keith Mitchell, which was my birth name. When my grandfather died in 1984, I changed it to my mother's maiden name, Coogan.  I totally wanted his name to continue. You should know who Jackie Coogan was, what he did for child earnings, what he went through, his history. I wanted to honor my grandfather and also do an absolute split between my younger television work and the future film career that I was planning on at the time.

G: Of course, Jackie Coogan is legendary as the first big child star, the developer of the Coogan Law to protect young performers' earnings and Uncle Fester on TV's The Addams Family. Did he talk a lot about the early days?

K: We were very aware of that history of my grandfather. Hewould say things like ""I didn't meet the Pope, the Pope met me.""  Great quotes from Charlie Chaplin like ""I only had one costar and that was Jackie Coogan.""  He definitely lived in that past, he had great successes from age four.  There's a great biography of  him called Jackie Coogan: The World's First Boy King. Chaplin was absolutely responsible for establishing my grandfather's image, costume and then Jackie and my great-grandfather ran with it.  My great-grandfather turned into a producer, created Jackie Coogan Productions and did My Boy, Long Live the King and Oliver Twist. His first talkie was Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  So, I knew about the legend really as I had grown up and I have read more and learned more. He went through so many things in his life. He married Betty Grable, fought in World War II, of course had a second career with The Addams Family.  l loved him dearly. He was the cranky, rascally old grandpa that a lot of people seem to have.

G: Do you have advice for young performers today?

Spend very thriftily, be wise with your money.  It doesn't last very long.  The fame comes and goes, it is very cyclical, enjoy it while it is happening, really, really, enjoy it, it is over before you know it.  You can come back, America loves a great come back story.  You might find yourself just continuing on and just working if it is something you really love to do.  If you really, really enjoy being on a set, if you really enjoy acting it is a great craft, something that calls to you, you have know choice but to do it.  But, if you are going to do it, certainly get an education to fall back because you may not ever work again and you've got to make a living.  It doesn't last forever and enjoy it while it is happening. I am very lucky to have broken into features at 16. I turned 17 on the set of Adventures in Babysitting, also for Disney. Chris Columbus was such a great director to us as kids.  He would see the story from the kids' point of view and that helps the audience see the story from the kids' point of view. Another Disney film I was very happy to do was Cheetah, which took me to Kenya and was one of the greatest times of my life.  I turned 18 on that set so just a year later.  What an unbelievable experience!

G: And now you're creating your own digital film productions.

K: Yes, and it's something almost anyone can do in their own way. You can write, you can produce and help other people out with their projects and friends and it is a different animal.  It is a different pace, you are shooting a lot more, you have a lot more room to improvise, still rolling, still rolling. I really like the way the industry is kind of changing.  It is miraculous and I took right to it.  A little combo of improvisation, a little combo of that classic structure of how to shoot a scene and how to do coverage but moving fast and light with digital and even 3D.  I did a 3D short.  It is really challenging but also a boon to the creative instinct. I love it.

G: Do you still keep in touch with ""the hound,"" Corey Feldman?

K: Yes, I love him but you do grow apart as adults.  We are not part of our daily lives. For 36 years we have worked side by side in the industry and share some of the same beginnings.  If you look at our IMDBs from the seventies they knock up against each other. So he is definitely respected by me also the only other person I could talk to who has  been through such a similar situation as myself.  He is a great one to lean on when I need to because he is the only one who understands. You look around and think there are not a lot of us left, so I don't want to lose touch with Corey ever. I have so much respect for him and I want to see more of him of course.  But you grow up. That is the theme of Fox and the Hound.  Adult situations can kind of drive some distance between you, not in the heart.

Corey and I will always be friends forever.",1314057600,,8122,4.268149117069981

I don't even remember ever seeing the sequel ""The Fox and the Hound II"" so this DVD combo was especially fun to watch.  I got to relieve part of my childhood and watch the beloved characters in a sequel, this time I shared it with my boys!  My youngest son loves dogs and he really got a kick out of watching these movies.  While the quality has definitely improved on the Blu-ray versions, it is still a 30-year old movie and the quality is somewhat older looking - I appreciate that though and feel it adds the classic Disney movie touch to it.  I would recommend purchasing this 3-disc Blu-ray combo because it not only improves the animation quality but it comes with the Blu-ray versions, DVD versions and some great bonus features!

""The Fox and Hound"" is a great family movie to watch too because of the great lesson it teaches.  The movie shows how even though the characters are different that they can still be friends.  With my sons both starting preschool next week I want them to start off fresh being friends with everyone and not singling anyone out.  The movie also has great songs and the voices of the animals are from some popular stars (Mickey Rooney, Corey Feldman, Kurt Russell, Patrick Swayze, Reba McEntire and more!)",1313366400,,1341,4.531120331950207

review for fox and the hound: 4/5 stars
great film, remains a classic in my eyes. vivid colors, good story and a nice moral. maybe a sad and depressing movie for children but disney had a good portrayal of relating common ethic issues to how we perceive things.

review for fox and the hound 2: 2/5 stars
i really have no opinion of this movie. never drew me in nor made me care for the characters. more of a ploy to make money from disney is the only thing i can really think of. pretty to look at, especially in blu ray but still, stick with the first fox and hound

blu ray review (quality and audio)

fox and hound:
image:3.5/5 stars. decent restoration of the colors, more vibrant and worth buying if your a fan of fox and the hound and want to transition from dvd to blu ray, if you didn't care much for this film, its a good rental
audio: 4/5 stars. crisp and clear. very nice and well done with the transfer

fox and the hound 2:
image: 4/5 stars. since this film was more recent, the transfer to blu ray kept a lot of the colors and made it pop. very satisfied with the quality
audio: 4/5 stars. same as the first fox and the hound",1312761600,6,1495,4.213286713286713

After buying a slew of the latest Disney Blu Ray releases (Beauty and the Beast, Fantasia, Bambi, etc) I was expecting another state-of-the-art fantastic 1080p transfer.  Unfortunately, the Mouse House has not taken this title as seriously as some of the others in its vault. Instead of giving us a glorious, painstakingly perfect restoration, it would seem they opted for tossing in the insulting ""sequel"" Fox and the Hound II to make up for the slacking effort.

Now I won't say it looks awful.  This Blu Ray is clearly a significant upgrade from the DVD, but it is also obviously missing the Disney touch I've come to expect.  For example, at the bottom right hand corner of the picture you will see an occasional black line flicker in and out.  Ordinarily Disney has gone in and removed these kind of print damages, through intense digital editing or by some other miraculous effort.  It is not the case for Fox and the Hound.  The black line is hardly noticeable, but once you notice it you can't stop looking at it.  It flickers in and out as it pleases, subtle at times, obnoxious at others.  A few instances it went all the way from the bottom of the picture to the top.  Nothing extreme for casual movie watchers, but for those of us who are really picky about picture presentation it can be unbearable.

Colors weren't really consistent either.  At times they were bright and vivid, at others they were dingy and dark.  Blacks are overwhelming in the wrong spots, turning shadows and shading into eclipses.  Unlike the animated Alice in Wonderland, which is bright and perky, even once the forests of Wonderland get dark, Fox and the Hound looks just a little too dark even in bright sunny scenes.

My overall opinion is that, while I'm glad to have an HD release of Fox and the Hound in my collection, this is not the Blu Ray I had dreamed of.  Personally I'm a little annoyed that the nasty sequel wasn't destroyed or forgotten about, much less released right alongside the classic, and I'm really disappointed that Disney didn't spend as much time as they usually do on the transfer.  For most Disney fans I doubt it'll be too much of a problem, since, like I said, 1080p certainly beats the DVD, but for those of us who are film geeks and get frustrated by imperfections, I would suggest waiting another 5 years in hopes another re-release will give this great movie the attention it deserves.",1312588800,52,2533,4.626398210290827
