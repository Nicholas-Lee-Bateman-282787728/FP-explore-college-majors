8439181,5,B004RQDRTO,"I love this movie just as much as The Broters McMullen. However, unlike The Brothers McMullen, the transfer for this blu ray is crisp and clean. Picture quality is way better than the fuzzy DVD. If you like She's the One and is wanting to upgrade to blu ray than by all means upgrade. However, I believe this title is a Best Buy exclusive so you'll only be able to get it from their store or website. I just drove to the nearest BB store, before they closed, and picke mine up. One of the best purchases I've made lately as this is such a great movie. I love Edward Burn's movies as they seem to draw from real life and not some fantasy realm. Can't say the same for Brothers McMullen, although a great movie as well, the transfer was bad.",1345334400,2,739,4.211267605633803
