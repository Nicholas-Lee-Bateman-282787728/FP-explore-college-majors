2566709,5,B000FI9OD6,"I can't imagine anything better than watching the custody battle between Sue Ellen and JR over little John Ross.  I also can't imagine anyone hotter than wealthy, blue eyed, rodeo guy Dusty Farlow.  It's kind of a sad season since Jock dies, but it's also great fun watching JR and the rest of the legitimate and illegitimate Ewing boys fall apart without Jock.  If that's not enough, the emotional breakdown of the stunning Pamela Ewing and the loving care her hotty husband pays her is worth the watch.  The season did puzzle me in one way, why would someone who looks like Mitch ever date someone like Lucy?",1162512000,3,610,4.62037037037037

2566712,4,B000FI9OD6,"The fifth season of this classic drama is still very entertaining, if not quite up to the quality of the earlier seasons, and I can't wait for the next season. However: What happened to the English subtitles? I really hope that this blunder will not be repeated on the following seasons, since the subtitles make viewing a little bit easier.",1160611200,2,341,4.7
2566713,5,B000FI9OD6,"I have all the DVD's up to this point, love this one just as much as the others.

Packaging on this set has evolved, instead of the whole thing being in the folding cardboard boxy thing, it is now contained within three plastick cases on the inside of the cardboard exterior boxing.  Much more durable, easier to take care of.",1160092800,3,326,4.416666666666667
2566714,4,B000FI9OD6,"This season of ""Dallas"" is probably the very best of the series. From the beginning of the following season there were already the early signs of the short falls that would plague the series in ensuing years (sub plot characters that received too much screen time etc) here was the central cast doing what they did best;fly through the crazy story lines with wonderful panache and a sense of humour and Barbara BelGeddes was in her element in this series slowly dealing with the death of her husband. The following season saw the disruption of the Bobby/Pam marriage which was never fully put back together. Here those two characters suffer their traumas but remain strong and loyal to each other, something that was never the same when the script writers started to play havoc with their story lines. Larry Hagman has a ball in this season , plotting, conniving etc and , as stated, the drama is all about the central characters. One disappointment is the lack of audio commentary and the special is a pretty poor show (a tour of the southfork ranch).",1157932800,5,1052,4.7228260869565215
2566715,4,B000FI9OD6,"Dallas' Season 5 Season Set was good overall. Right off the bat, the flaw is in the extras. The tour of Southfork Ranch feature is okay, BUT, it seems like we already got that in a pervious set. Why no cast interviews? Without giving much away, there was a departing cast member that got a lot of attention in the reunion special ... yet here on the season set in the extras, the cast, the departure, and all is missing. It seems a bit impersonal.

Quality wise, Season 5 felt a bit different from the previous seasons. Yeah, it was still good and by far more interesting and higher in quality than most things out there on tv then and now, but, it wasn't as thrilling as the previous seasons. The plots are a bit more tamed and it takes the entire season for certain plots and climaxes to occur. In other seasons, every few episodes would be packed with shocking twists and turns. This one had its share too but it wasn't as fast paced and exciting as the other seasons.

This was still (as usual it seems) Linda Gray and Larry Hagman's season. Both's plots really drove the season forward and both were right on the mark in their scenes and acting. Surprisingly, this was also Barbara Bel Geddes' season. She really emerged in this season, taking on a more active role in the family's business and personal matters. It was nice to see her have more scenes and be a tough, strong character throughout the entire season rather than in just an episode or two as in the previous ones. There were also other actors who had bigger roles this season (and in future seasons) that really added something new to the show.

In all, definitely worth your money and time. This was quality t.v. unlike a lot of what makes it onto the air today. Hopefully future seasons will get more in terms of special features and stuff. Other than that, it's a good season and show to add to your collection.",1155945600,14,1883,4.436416184971098
2566716,5,B000FI9OD6,"Dallas was  One of my shows back in the 80's. this is truly One of the Greatest Shows Ever. JR Ewing was always must see Tv back in the day on friday nights. alot of drama, twists&turns happen during this season. this was Dallas during it's peak&Prime.  can't wait to Buy it real soon.  back in the day I had to wait every friday night to tune in for th next episode,but now I can watch all those shows in a whole weekend sitting. this is Classic.the whole Cast holds it down.",1152576000,3,476,4.1521739130434785
2566717,5,B000FI9OD6,"What is really the 4th season is a great year, probably my favorite of the entire show, although it ties with 11 several years later.  It is exciting for fans because a lot of long running stories get started, with new characters who will play a big part coming into their own after the last year, including Afton, Clayton, and Rebecca.  Jim Davis is of course lost, and an episode pays tribute to him, but Susan Howard who had guest starred to this point then joins the main title.  Other than that, it is continued goodness as the death of Jock and the divorce of JR and Sue Ellen add more drama than usual.  It is great drama, and I hope it sells gangbusters so we can get the rest as soon as possible.",1146614400,13,705,4.2388059701492535

2566804,5,B000FI9OD6,"After a literally shocking pool of a finale, DALLAS returns for a fifth season, and the wheeling, dealing, lying, scheming and backstabbing doesn't let up for one single second. If you thought all was calm at Southfork after the storm, think again...

The Storm Has Broken At Southfork. Somebody has been found dead in the pool at Southfork, and J.R. & Cliff are the prime suspects. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Shocking secrets are about to be unleashed that could threaten even the very lives of the players in this deadly game of Russian Roulette. Heartbreak, paternity scandals, murder, suicide, attempted suicide, double-crossing, wheeling, dealing, backstabbing, the dissolution of a marriage, power struggles, custody battles. All this and more courtesy of your friend, J.R. Ewing.

The acting this season is as strong as it ever has been, with special mention going once again to Barbara Bel Geddes. She handles the bulk of the emotion, and it's not always pleasant. In fact, it's downright horrific, what happens sometimes. But she carries through it with absolute grace and serenity. Victoria Principal also does a stellar job with the emotional scenes, and she really shines in the maternal aspect, which may or may not be a reflection of what she felt when Sue Ellen was utterly incapable of taking care of John Ross. Charlene Tilton also does a fantastic job with the emotional scenes as well, conveying anger, hurt, frustration, and even terror.

It is cool to be able to watch retro TV in a new format.  It looks very good considering the age of the footage.  If you are a real Dallas fan and you want to know all of the facts as you follow the new Dallas series, this is a season that you won't want to miss.  This season is a pivotal point in the series.  Jock Ewing (played by the late Jim Davis) does not return during this season.  The story reveals how the writers take him out of the show.  In the show, they keep him alive up until Episode 13 in January 1982 by allowing the viewers to believe that he is doing work for the government in South America.  Sadly, it was due to the real life death of Jim Davis (April 26, 1981).  Out of respect for Davis, they allowed the character to die with him instead of replacing him.  The whole dynamic of the show begins to change as a result.  It is still a great show; however, you never see the show the same after that point.  The entire series just seems to build on the storyline as it progresses.  Of course it has a few hits and misses like everything else, but overall it is a great watch.  You won't regret your purchase if you were a former Dallas fan or if you are just getting started with the new Dallas series!

Ewing/ Barnes feud is very much alive, J.R. scheming to marry Sue Ellen to add John Ross' voting rights to his own with Ewing Oil. J.R. & Bobby feuding for control of Ewing Oil.

2566826,5,B000FI9OD6,"i felt like season Three kicked the show off,but season 4/5 is when things started getting more and more interesting,i can tell 5,6,and 7 are going to be the best seasons. Season 5 starts off with kristin's body in the pool(where season 4 left off,but she wasn't yet identified) of course J.R lies and says cliff was drowning kristin,when really he cam to the house and saw her in the pool,J.R was standing above on the balcony with a BROKEN railing,they go to court and it is ruled accidental death. episode 2 is even better than the first sue ellen still has John ross at southern cross ranch(dusty and claytons) and she is happy to have the time with her son. Meanwhile Pam's increasing 'obsession'(as bobby put it) with having a baby(or not being able to have one) is becoming more and more obvious. Sue ellen goes with John ross to albuquerque for kristin's funeral,Pam comes later to visit with Sue ellen and john ross,she is becoming more interested in John Ross,and Sue Ellen notices it too. Dusty tells Sue Ellen he's made arrangements for her and her son to be protected. He takes her to the connecting flight as they see JR looking down at them from above. Dusty and his guys stop J.R's men from taking John Ross and sue ellen and her son get on the flight.ep. 3 'Showdown at san angelo' J. R. uses Miss Ellie to gain access to the Southern Cross Ranch and his son as Sue Ellie has misgivings about building a new life with Dusty. JR convinces Ellie to call Sue Ellen and make arrangements to see John Ross, which she does. The Southfork helicopter arrives in San Angelo the next day, bringing Ellie, and JR not far behind. Sue Ellen suspects he's up to something, which he denies, and she reminds him that he's surrounded by armed men. Ellie and Clayton meet for the first time and agree that while they're on opposite sides of the John Ross debate, the fight is not theirs. Sue Ellen denies JR's offer of a quick, painless divorce in exchange for his son.
JR and Ellie play with John Ross, JR tosses a ball towards the helicopter. When John Ross chases it, JR hands him to Ellie and nudges her towards the waiting chopper. He tries to convince her to take him aboard, reminding her that Jock says he belongs at Southfork. Ellie refuses to be part of it, giving the boy back to Sue Ellen.  this is honestly all i ahve seen of this season so far,but i can already tell it will be good.",1311033600,,2396,4.433106575963719

2566830,5,B000FI9OD6,"**NOTE - This review contains Spoilers**

Season Five of ""Dallas"" originally aired on CBS during the 1981-82 season containing twenty-six episodes and for the second year in a row, the series was #1 in the Nielsen ratings. Despite the absence of a shocking cliffhanger, this has been my favorite season of ""Dallas"" so far, and much better than the higher-rated, over-hyped Season 4!

The real-life passing of actor Jim Davis had the writers scrambling to incorporate his absence into the scripts, and the first half of the season Jock is away on business in South America. After Miss Ellie receives the devastating news of a helicopter crash, J.R., Bobby and Ray go searching for him, but have no luck. Each of the family members deal with his death in different ways. No disrespect to the memory of Mr. Davis, but orney, craggy-faced Jock Ewing was never one of my favorite characters. I was delighted that Howard Keel as swaggering yet affable Clayton Farlow was given much more screen time in the patriarch role. He helps Sue Ellen get her life in order after she wins custody of son John Ross and when she decides to leave his Southern Cross ranch and let his son Dusty (Jared Martin) get on with his life. As the season progresses, J.R. begins trying to woo Sue Ellen back and even proposes they re-marry. She becomes undecided after tragedy befalls Cliff Barnes. Linda Gray looks absolutely stunning this season, 41 in real life at the time. Unfortunately, the next year she got that trendy but unflattering '80s mullet!

Pam ends up in a psychiatric hospital after having a breakdown and being rescued from a rooftop by Bobby. Later, when Bobby discovers J.R. fathered the late Kristin's baby and actually pays cash for the infant, his plans to confront J.R. with the child backfire when Pam mistakenly believes he came from an adoption agency, and Bobby doesn't have the heart to tell her the truth. Pam and Bobby begin raising Christopher as their own, but the storyline takes a few more twists.

Without Jock to guide him, Ray gets in over his head on a business deal, losing millions and going into a depression. This puts a damper on Donna's success as a best-selling authoress and their marriage. Perhaps my favorite scene of the entire season is when Donna has a showdown in a honky-tonk bar with the woman Ray cheated with. Susan Howard looks absolutely gorgeous in a fur-coat as she utters the priceless line ""I just wanted to see what the competition looked like...with CLOTHES ON!"". Howard's portrayal as a no-nonsense, powerful political widow didn't do much for me in previous seasons, but this year she ingratiates herself to the family (and the viewer) by acting as confidant to Miss Ellie, Bobby and Pam. And you have to love a woman who can take a drink in the face, sucker-punch a homewrecking floozie and still look like a million bucks while doing it.

Lucy also has marriage troubles and she and Mitch separate. She embarks on a modelling career that takes a sordid turn when her photographer turns out to have stalkerish tendencies and holds her captive.

When Afton Cooper (Audrey Landers) gets tired of J.R. pimping her out to make good on business deals, she comes crawling back to Cliff Barnes, he having obtained a prestigious new job at Wentworth Industries, courtesy of his wealthy mother Rebecca (Priscilla Pointer, who reminds me of Agnes Moorehead at times here). Unfortunately, greed gets the best of Cliff and he ends the season in the hospital in a coma.

This season boasts some notable guest stars: Morgan Brittany makes her debut as Pam and Cliff's half-sister Catherine Wentworth; Pam's therapist is played magnificently by the always-dependable Gretchen Wyler; Patty McCormack (""The Bad Seed"") shows up as a patient of Mitch's who eventually tells Lucy she wants him for herself; Diane McBain as a matchmaking friend of Sue Ellen's who turns on her.

The overall picture quality on these DVDs is a big improvement over previous sets. Almost all the episodes and scenes are much brighter, clearer and more colorful. Visually, this is the best release yet, but the discs are still dual-sided and they are housed in plastic snapcases this time instead of a digipak.

A great season for fans; the show is in its prime here and running on all four cylinders. Highly recommended!",1300579200,2,4320,4.834912043301759

2566833,3,B000FI9OD6,"Dallas had been riding high in the wake of ""Who Shot J.R."", but going into this season there was a personal tragedy. And that was the untimely death of Jim Davis, who played the family patriarch Jock Ewing. With his character being taken to work in South America, the writers put his character on hold and focused on the rest of the cast and their storylines. When it was decided to kill off the character, I was upset. But that only added more depth to the show and to the other characters especially Miss Ellie and J.R.

My Favorite episodes here in the collection is the two-parter that revoled around Jock's return to Southfork, and his eventual demise: ""Barbecue Two"" and ""The Search"", especially at the end of ""Search"" where you see J.R. start to tear up; he then looks up and smiles, realizing that his father is now at peace, then at the very end is that famous portrait of Jim Davis as Jock, that would be seen in later episodes all through the show's 14-year run, with the caption: ""Jim Davis  1909-1981"".

it's a worthy bargain....its worth it.",1289692800,3,1055,4.542105263157895
2566834,5,B000FI9OD6,"The JR and Sue Ellen story was beginning to get old this season as you wonder what they ever saw in each other in the first place. Sue Ellen briefly seems to enjoy a period of living single rejecting Cliff and JR and realizing that Dusty belongs on rodeo circuit not at home playing daddy. When she finally comes back to JR (after 10 episodes) it appears that after a few weekend visitations with John Ross and she thinks JR has changed. (Funny that's what she thought after he got shot too) A large part of this season seems devoted to their marraige. I found myself wishing they would reunite just to move onto something else. It also points to what would become a major downfall of this show: the stories drag on endlessly.
Sue Ellen's decision to return coincides with the death of Jock so that she returns just in time for the next tragedy. Of course, the death of Jim Davis left a gap in the show that never was really filled. Sue Ellen and JR become closer (after remarrying) and Bobby and Pam grow further apart as the fight for Ewing oil rages on between the brothers.

The storylines towards the end are more entertaining and contain more action. The adoption of Christopher, the truth about Kristen; Lucy's kidnapping, rescue and divorce form Mitch; Cliff's embezzling company funds and suicide attempt. The action seems to take place in the last 7 episodes beginning with the ""Malestrom"" episode. Actually a little better than season 4 but not as good as 1,2 and 3.

The tour of the ranch in the special features is something of disappointment. The ""Southfork"" ranchhouse is actually much smaller than it looks on tv mainly because the ranch was used just for outdoor scenes. Indoor scenes were shot in a studio and therefore the inside of the ranchhouse doesn't really look anything like what viewers saw on tv every week.",1287187200,3,1835,4.625766871165644

2566840,5,B000FI9OD6,"Dallas was one of the best shows on tv back in the 80's. We have bought all 7 seasons that are out up to now 10-30-07 and look forward to the other 6 seasons coming out. Much better then todays tv shows. We watch 2 epsiodes every night. We love this show. This was a great show at it's best. For you younger people that never seen this show back in the late 70's & the 80's, it is worth the money to buy all 13 seasons. There are only 7 seasons up to now 10-30-07 but I am sure WB will release the others one at a time. I Hope. Such good actors that this show offers. To watch it on DVD without commericals is so great. You can't go wrong with this show. It keeps your interest from start to finish, We always look forward to the evenings so we can set down and watch this show to see what JR Ewing is up to this time. Thank you for reading my review.

2566841,5,B000FI9OD6,"First of all, all us true dallas fans know this season as season 4. Warners just counts the 5 part mini-series as the first full""season"". Thus, this would make the maroon boxset with Lucy,J.R, and SueEllen really season 4 , and not season 5. I disagree with the fans whom say this season is not as good. For me, the green and purple seasons were VERY boring, and my least favorite.its so boring and SueEllen and J.R are getting along, and for the most part, in both those seasons, they are. I don't like Kristen, i think she is a bad actress, and Pams fro in the purple season was repulsive, and so was the troll they stuck her with. And it was totally out of character for everyone to be so concerned that J.R. was shot....cheesy..... in the THIS season, the best season since the miniseries and season 1(the blue boxset),SueEllen takes JohnRoss and flees to Southern Cross Ranch,Pam's acting gets better and she has compelling storylines,Miss Ellie as mentioned before has to deal w Jocks death, we meet Crazy Katherine,J.R. is as nasty as ever,Mis Ellie goes off on J.R,Sue Ellen and J.r divorce, and if I am right, this is one of the few seasons where she is SOBER throughout. Cliff gets set up by J.R and has another affair w SueEllen, and if you thought it was good in season 1, you aint seen nothin yet! five stars! I promise if u get this season, you too will mark it as one of your favorites.",1192406400,2,1401,4.413127413127413

Major points of the season are as follows:

After suffering several miscarriages, Pam (Victoria Principal) is obsessed with motherhood.

Bobby (Patrick Duffy) is obsessed with finding the father of Kristen's baby.

Ray (Steve Kanaly) is obsessed in proving tht he can make it on his own without his wife Donna's (Susan Howard) money.

Cliff (Ken Kercheval) continues his obsession in destroying the Ewings.

Rebecca (Priscilla Pointer) is obsessed with proving herself a ""good mother"" after having abandoned her children when they were young.

In light of his impotency, Dusty (Jared Martin) is obsessed to show how much of a ""man"" is he.

Lucy (Charlene Tilton) is obsessed with winning her husband back, while hubby Mitch (Leigh J. McCloskey) is obsessed with making it on his own.

Lucy's photographer, Roger (Dennis Redfield), has an unhealthy obsession with her, leading him to begin stalking the model-wannabe.

Katherine (Morgan Brittany) begins her obsession with brother-in-law Bobby, which will come to a head when she mows him down in a couple of seasons.

Vaughn Leland (Dennis Patrick) returns in his obsessive quest to bring down J.R.

And J.R. (Larry Hagman) continues, after a few missteps, to run over everyone!

Also, the writers were able to stretch out the absence of ""Jock"" (the late Jim Davis) by having the character noticeably absent and finally ""announcing"" his death in a mid-season installment, thus opening the door for the fight for control of Ewing Oil.

""The Search"" becomes a tribute to Davis, interspersed with clips from previous episodes that showcased the towering and much beloved actor.

8122855,5,B000FI9OD6,"I've been a fan of the TV Show of ""Dallas"" since I was quite young & my favorite memory is when J.R. & Bobby has their hot & heated moments dealing with Cliff & his gang & giving Cliff a hard time to think it over while J.R. & Bobby are running the business of Ewing Oil. If you or anyone is a total fan of the TV Show of ""Dallas"", get it before they run out, because watching a episode of ""Dallas"" feels like your part of the action on Ewing Oil with J.R. & Bobby being there being brothers & partners in crime in the city of Dallas.",1518566400,,534,3.8636363636363638
