8207278,4,B000T28POW,"This man took on the responsibility of locating and prosecuting many of the Nazis who evaded the Nuremberg trials, and while way too many never were found, he did get Adolph Eichmann, one notorious bastard who became the head of the concentration camps.  He was captive himself at Auschwitz, and went from a successful career as an architect to a life devoted to prosecution and pursuit of those Nazis who thought they had escaped!  One has to admire this man, but his efforts were often met with serious resistance and no cooperation from law and other national officials!  Some even demonstrated and protested what he was doing, and this was in the 50s and 60s!

While true justice is something this life rarely finds, Simon lived and acted as he promised those that were murdered by the Nazis he said, 'I have never forgotten you' and somehow, I have to believe, when he passed on, there were over 6 million souls who met this man in the next life they could not help but remember and welcome him!",1406678400,2,1000,4.601123595505618

8207280,5,B000T28POW,"Simon Wiesenthal eschewed most labels affixed to him, preferring ""survivor"" above all else.  To me, he is a hero of Earth.  This fact really stands out when you consider how his life's work has been so repetitiously maligned after the fact.  The same thing happens to all the real heavy hitters for light and justice.  When you make it your business to expose the darkness and ignorance which fertilizes the banality of evil, well... everything that scurries for the crevices will eventually come looking for who flicked the switch on.  When you raise your hand for righteousness, you might lose a couple of fingers. Simon Wiesenthal not only clearly realized this but instead of shying away from that dynamic, he dove in head first.  To be sure, Wiesenthal made many different statements that, when reviewed by modern day historians, especially those already looking to the scenario with a critical eye could seem to be contradictory or confusing.  One must consider the political, social and ultimately GLOBAL milieu that Wiesenthal was operating in and without entering into territory of justifications, suffice it to say - nobody really knows the exact details of what Mr. Wiesenthal did or HAD to do in his time here to affect the change he did.  Nobody that is except for himself and possibly the people he brought to justice.

A great example of this insanely harsh criticism is that of Mr. Wiesenthal's inflation of the number of concentration camps in which he had been interred.  In many critical pieces you will find statements that suggest the claim of being in more than thirteen genocidal death camps is incorrect and that Mr. Wiesenthal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/had-been-in/dp/0767928733/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">had been in</a>&nbsp;""...no more than six camps.""  Really think about that statement.  So, no MORE than SIX?  OK then.  For my money, if you've seen six genocidal death camps... well, you've pretty much seen them ALL.  Nobody takes issue with Jack Bauer when he bends the truth for justice.  Remember when Superman flew backwards around the planet b/c he really missed Lois?  OK, so they're not real people, but you get my point.  And if you don't then here it is.  Anybody dedicating their life to hunting down nazis and bringing them to justice gets a ton of leeway with me.  The end doesn't always justify the means, but sometimes you have to trust that the person making the ends knows what they are doing, based on their experience.  Simon Wiesenthal, a solder of justice, was just such a person.

You will no doubt run into someone who will at some point try to at least make light of what happened during The Shoah.  Some might even try to convince you that it never really happened.  Simon Wiesenthal and the work he did is all the proof you will ever need that not only did it happen... not only was it worse than you can truly comprehend with a mind that hasn't been there...  it is STILL happening today in many parts of the world.  That's why this message is just as vital and pressing as it was in `43, `53, `63, `73, `83, `93 and `03 as it will be in 2013.  Stand against tyranny or you may be tyrannized.  Stand against proscription or you may get proscribed.  When the madness actually starts, it becomes infinitely more dangerous to speak up, and infinitely more important that somebody does so.

Oh you wanted to know what's on the box set?  Quite a lot actually.  Not only are these DVDs packed with information and history, they are equally stuffed with emotion and melancholie.  Other reviewers have noted that these features are overly depressing, but I disagree.  They are enraging and horrific at times but they are motivating, uplifting and hopeful as well.
