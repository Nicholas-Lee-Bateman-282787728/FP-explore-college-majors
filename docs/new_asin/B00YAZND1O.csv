7210307,5,B00YAZND1O,"A creepy Icelandic thriller, highly recommended!! I previously read the book by Yrsa Sigurdardottir and the movie perfectly captures the suspense and chilling mood of the novel. ***Please disregard the many reviews calling this movie a love story. Its about as far from a love story as you can get! These people are talking about another movie with the same title, and left their reviews in the wrong place.",1517011200,,407,4.913043478260869

7210316,5,B00YAZND1O,"Thoughtful, sorrowful, a mournful lullaby of a movie. Haunting landscapes and powerful acting. Sad, full of loss, wonderful.",1513987200,,124,5.944444444444445

7210320,4,B00YAZND1O,"I had no problems viewing this (my subtitles were shut off by default for some reason, and I had to fix that in the settings, which was easy). As someone who used to love but now can't sit through anything with gratuitous gore/violence, I found this to have just enough suspense and darkness to it. It's a tragic ghost story that was beautifully shot and well acted throughout.",1512604800,,377,4.5588235294117645
7210321,1,B00YAZND1O,Not worth the time... Thought it would get better but it didn't...,1512345600,,66,4.583333333333333
7210322,1,B00YAZND1O,Amazon did another bad job of putting a foreign movie on their listings.  The subtitles are so small that you can't read it and the resolution is really bad.  I'll just wait till this movie comes out on DVD or Bluray...,1512172800,,219,4.317073170731708
7210323,4,B00YAZND1O,Pretty good! I would watch it again some time. Love the ending!,1512086400,,63,4.333333333333333
7210324,5,B00YAZND1O,What a beautiful way to tell a story based on past life love that never dies.,1512000000,,77,3.875
7210325,5,B00YAZND1O,"Artistic - like watching the nuances of a poem. Very nicely done. Would love to see more meaningful films like this, without the clutter of indecency.",1512000000,,150,4.8076923076923075
7210326,5,B00YAZND1O,"What an outstanding supernatural police procedural set in Iceland. The acting, writing, cinematography and direction are all first rate. And the shots of desolate portions of Iceland were outstanding. I loved this film, which, right now, is my number one film of the year.

And I love horror.",1511827200,,292,5.083333333333333
7210327,5,B00YAZND1O,Beautiful movie.  Wish there were more movies like this.,1511481600,,56,5.222222222222222
7210328,2,B00YAZND1O,"First of all, beware the reviews here. Some of the contributors are rating a different movie of the same title that was released two years prior and has nothing in common with this one. The movie is set in Iceland and you'll have to deal with subtitles. Many years subsequent to their shared youth, classmates are dying off under somewhat mysterious circumstances. A psychiatrist is drawn into this, even as he deals with the disappearance of his young son. The plot is somewhat plodding but springs a supernatural twist on you at the end. The style is very noir. It's watchable, but just by a hair.",1511308800,,599,4.660377358490566
7210329,5,B00YAZND1O,"I highly recommend this film, great story and cast.",1511049600,,51,4.777777777777778

7210332,1,B00YAZND1O,"Probably a very good movie, based on a book by a very well known Scandinavian author, but I don't understand the language and a unable to turn on subtitles.",1510876800,,156,4.413793103448276
7210333,2,B00YAZND1O,"Kind of hard to rate a movie if you can't watch it.

*UPDATE 11/20* Got a refund from Amazon. It looks like the subtitles have been added now, so I'll give it another go later this week.",1510876800,,186,4.027027027027027
7210334,1,B00YAZND1O,"Like others have said, there are no subtitles, so unless you understand Icelandic avoid this movie.",1510790400,,99,5.25

7210336,3,B00YAZND1O,"I thought this was a really good movie. The acting is great and the storyline keeps you guessing all the way to the end. Give it a watch, you won't regret it.",1510531200,,158,3.96875
7210337,1,B00YAZND1O,"There are no subtitles available for this movie. I have called Amazon to let them know that this is a problem, and they told me that there are no subtitles available.  That subtitles are only retrieved from the production studio and there are none available for this movie.  I asked them doesn't it seem odd with it being a foreign film.  They agreed it was and would I like my money back.  No, I want to watch my damn movie, but sure, my money back would be fine.  *eye roll*",1510444800,,476,4.2444444444444445
7210338,5,B00YAZND1O,"Not the best production value but story intriguing and a good representation of past life connections. Having been certified in Regressive Hypnosis, I found the therapist fairly good in that she did not impose any ""leading"" questions. The female lead's aversion to water began when she saved Samuel from the water, this can be a common ""trigger"" when you meet someone from another lifetime. Genetic and/or cellular memory is another matter all together but was what the scientist in her was able to more readily accept, rather than the ""consciousness""(soul)continuing. As physics say, matter can not be destroyed, the soul moves from lifetime to lifetime for the purpose of growing, meeting new challenges and overcoming old ones by learning lessons, and resolving karma with former people. Although fairly slow moving and I felt it could have been presented better, I still rate high at 4.5 stars.",1510444800,,898,5.157534246575342

7210342,1,B00YAZND1O,very very slow,1510185600,,14,4.0
7210343,5,B00YAZND1O,"I really enjoyed this.. completely separate from the plot, i appreciated its unusual style... the lighting, timing, conversations, etc.  In the plot, I also thought it was unusual (in a good way) the way they showed all this personal stuff, but also their work life, seeing the therapist, etc.. it showed how the personal part was affecting them. So many romantic-type movies seem to exist in a world outside of work, where everything is perfectly lit, conversations have no awkward pauses, everyone has a gang of friends to cheer them up, etc. The negatives were that some things were slightly clunky (in less of a good way), but it is obviously not a big Hollywood blockbuster, so i'm not counting it against them. And PS: High fives for making the woman the scientist and the man the actor.",1510185600,,793,4.746376811594203
7210344,3,B00YAZND1O,"I was intrigued by the premise in the description but had figured out the ending only 15 minutes in. The acting and cinematography were superb  but the development of the plot was slow, at times plodding. I felt like it had great promise but the script did not live up to the quality of the actors.",1507680000,,298,4.321428571428571
7210345,1,B00YAZND1O,"OMG this was slow moving. I forced myself to watch 40 minutes of this before I couldn't take it anymore and shut it off..Don't these scriptwriters realize what they're doing? Here's a good example of very poor scriptwriting from the movie:
""Do you draw?""
""I don't know.""
Don't waste your time with this one.",1506384000,,307,4.703703703703703
7210346,3,B00YAZND1O,Slow moving but had to keep watching to see where it was going to go. Glad when the theme finally turned the corner. Good all in all.,1506211200,,133,3.962962962962963
7210347,1,B00YAZND1O,So slow and boring. I finished it with no payoff.,1506038400,,49,4.0
7210348,4,B00YAZND1O,"Really good film about reincarnation and the emergence of buried memories.  Acting was good, the soundtrack worked beautifully for me, the story was solid.  If you're looking for action-packed, find another movie.  If you enjoy a thoughtful and introspective movie that is a bit moody in a good way, with a great soundtrack... you'll definitely like it!",1505347200,,353,5.157894736842105
7210349,1,B00YAZND1O,i couldn't even get through it.. it was terrible and slow and just awful,1505001600,,72,4.214285714285714

7210351,5,B00YAZND1O,Wish it hadn't started off so slow - I almost gave up a few times but let it keep going.  The end was worth the wait :=)  A sweet low=key love story that's too hard to find these days,1505001600,,183,3.6666666666666665
7210352,5,B00YAZND1O,"I liked the movie a lot.
Parts of the movie that stand out to me was:
How the act of saving him set off a slow ticking time bomb of realizations that in both of their lives begain a halt of everything in their current lives.
She developed a fear of water he had hit his head a couldn't act...
Both being drawn to each other...
The the pictures that once were strange images became totally clear after her hypnosis treatment.
Bring them not to the obvious but to acceptance of each other.
At the point when he said, ""I remember you"" basically for the second time she didn't run away...
Regardless of how they have found each other!",1505001600,,630,4.302521008403361
7210353,2,B00YAZND1O,"I thought the movie dragged ... the characters were extremely hesitant ... I feel the story could have been better ... just didn't like the prolonged pauses by characters ... I wouldn't recommend this movie; there are too many good ones regarding REINCARNATION, WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER.",1504569600,,284,5.0638297872340425

7210356,5,B00YAZND1O,Great movie. Finally a movie that is romantic and doesn't involve someone dying of cancer. It really spoke to me.,1504224000,,113,4.7
7210357,5,B00YAZND1O,"I loved this movie. It started kinda off, but then it picked up. Love the ending. If u don't believe in reincarnation this movie is not for you.",1503878400,,144,4.178571428571429
7210358,5,B00YAZND1O,This movie is about twin souls/twin flames. I enjoyed this movie...,1503532800,,67,5.181818181818182
7210359,2,B00YAZND1O,"Meh. You can do without this one! Storyline was extremely weak! I wanted to see it because the description and trailer made it sound like an interesting love story but no, it was mediocre. I held on hoping it would get better, but it just didn't deliver. No real explanation is given for why things are the way they are, not even speculation. In the end, there are too many holes.",1503187200,,380,4.366197183098592

7210361,1,B00YAZND1O,Acting was alright but the movie dragged and didn't seem too much in having enough for a good plot. The whole scene of a storm was better off turning it into a tsunami instead because it didn't make sense,1500336000,,204,4.256410256410256
7210362,1,B00YAZND1O,This was awful in every respect.  The storyline simply makes no sense. You hang on thinking maybe it will have a great twist only to realize in the last 15-20 minutes of the film that you've been had; you've wasted time you cannot get back for the most gawd-awful plot ever.,1499644800,,274,4.372549019607843
7210363,3,B00YAZND1O,"Same thing here except for melancholy and longing instead of angst.  The director likes looong drawn out gazes and fuzzy shots with pulses of organ music instead of a solid storyline and dialog.  I stayed through the whole thing but I really can't recommend anyone else doing that unless they like ""artsy"".  This would have made a very good half hour vignette.",1499385600,,360,4.774193548387097
7210364,5,B00YAZND1O,"Well written, a bit confusing at first until memories return. The scientific discussion and resolution are gripping, and the end of the story is just another beginning.",1498521600,,168,5.2592592592592595
7210365,5,B00YAZND1O,"I love this movie! Very cute romance movie, a little slow at first but well worth it in the end. The story line is sweet and unpredictable which I think anyone would enjoy!",1497398400,,172,4.242424242424242

7210369,5,B00YAZND1O,Deeply felt beauty in a gorgeous setting with people who are living one life yet yearning for something long lost that finds them. Memorable and speaks directly to the soul. It's these films that should get acclaim rather than what people and particularly young people watch today. Thank you for this gem,1496016000,,304,4.865384615384615

Guy: Hey, you want to grab some coffee, uh, what is the other thing, oh, tea, maybe?
Girl: Sure!
Guy: How about back at my place since I stood you up because I can't stand sound and bright light.

No one thought that was creepy?  It was so difficult to get into this movie.  The interaction and engagement is cringy.

""Are you sure we never met before?"" sounds like a lame pickup line some douche gives a girl at Barnes and Noble.",1495152000,,501,4.287234042553192

7210375,3,B00YAZND1O,"I don't like it when there is parts where they glaze over them talking to look like time has passed. It makes me feel like I missed out on it. Which it why I should stick to books I guess, but still. Also... it was bitter sweet. The moments seemed short and made a good representation of what time feels like. Especially as they were going over traumas, it feels just like that. Infinite and yet so short. Funny how that is. One moment you hold onto. A good thoughtful movie, to think of sharing memories from previous life's. But still. This felt like it was missing something. Don't it always. Despite that- what I did like: the timeless connection. How the chemistry was there between the actors through the speak none dialogue. Creating the perfect atmosphere of timid lovers who at the same time already know each other. The atmosphere was definitely there, and the presence the actors had with all their scenes. Not matter what they were doing- acting, dealing with cells- it felt real. Applauds to that. A c+ bittersweet movie that was simple in an element okay fashion. I liked it. ;D",1492041600,,1092,4.576530612244898

7210379,1,B00YAZND1O,"Potential, maybe, but it's far from realized. The dialog is corny, the scenes aren't cohesive, and the directing is absurd (every shot is a long gaze at the actors' overacted emotions and reactions). A lot probably could have been cleaned up with better editing. Alas. The DOP did a good job, and the guy playing the male lead looks like he might be a good actor if directed better. I think there's probably some other talent hidden somewhere in it, but it's hard to find. I could only make it half way before getting fed up.",1490140800,2,525,4.479166666666667

7210382,3,B00YAZND1O,"The acting was pretty good compared to many indie films, but everything else was subpar.  The story itself had a lot of promise and would have been benefited immensely from better pacing and character development.  If the main characters were a little more rounded and their personalities included more than interest in their jobs, they'd have been easier to identify with and care about.

There were several points where I was just confused about what was going on.  It's good when a script leaves just enough out to make you think, but when you leave out key connections of how a character gets from point A to point B emotionally, there's not enough left for the viewer to connect the dots.  After the accident, both characters were suddenly all screwed up emotionally and it wasn't clear why Sam was freaking out (other than a concussion he admitted to not having) and if Leah's problem was with water, running water, stress, or what.  Eventually her problem was answered, but her plight was incoherent for most of the movie and I never did figure out for certain what Sam's problem was - confusing current and past lives? Why couldn't he read and why did light bother him? What did his symptoms have to do with anything?

Another thing that bugged me a lot is that the lighting in most of the scenes was inconsistent, with weather, time of day, light source, brightness, and shadows all being widely varied in different parts of the same scene.  For instance, during Sam's drowning scene, the beach and pier portions were obviously shot during the day but the swimming portion was clearly shot at night.  When Leah's in his apartment the first time, the lighting is so different between the living room and kitchen that it looks like it gets cloudy just while he's in the kitchen but when he's back in the living room the kitchen in the background looks sunny.  I can't tell if it was a poorly thought-out artistic adjustment, or poorly considered timing.

Overall, the movie had a good story that needed more fleshing out and decent photography that needed more consistent lighting.",1487980800,9,2088,4.756232686980609

The hints of former lives were placed and paced perfectly, building to a sweet, lovely and riveting crescendo. The cinematography and music helped enormously and were totally in synch with the exposition. Kudos to the Director and scriptwriter for not filling the screen with four-plus letter words and gratuitous sex. The actors looked like real people and brought the characters to life.

7210493,2,B00YAZND1O,"Spoiler alert.
This is a 2015 movie that tries to answer the question: What becomes of star-crossed lovers whose last words pledge eternal love? An answer below.
The scene is a contemporary American seaside west coast city. The leading characters are 20-somethings. Leah (Stefanie Butler) is a scientist who works in a lab. Although working on an apparently cutting edge cellular biological breakthrough, seems bored with the whole thing. Samuel (Joe Egender) is a struggling wanabee actor, appearing as a low-life post-hippy character. Neither is portrayed as likable; perhaps a person you could envisage as interesting or someone you could be friendly with.
One day, while jogging along a pier off a sunny beach, Leah spies a swimmer drowning, disrobes appropriately and dives in to rescue him, a stranger (its Sam). She just had to do it. Why? (see below). Their relationship that develops slowly, is on again, off again as Leah has developed hydrophobia. Sam sometimes mentions that she seems familiar to him. What does that mean? (see below). Sam meanwhile is in and out of offered roles. Leah goes to a shrink, where her hydrophobia has driven her; she has become dehydrated and hasn't bathed for many weeks. She has lost her position in the lab and has a job offer in Vancouver.
Under hypnotic recall, it turns out in another adult life, she and her lover drowned during a love making session and in a submerging flooded farmhouse made mutual vows that their love is eternal. But careful attention to detail reveals that this is many years before in wartime Germany and her lover is Jewish. It is an earlier timeby Jove, they have been reincarnated! The hypnotic recall has solved her hydrophobia. Subsequently they kiss on a beach bench, their future uncertain.
The concept has great potential but the acting, direction and script just aren't there. Perhaps in a sequel they will have the luck to reincarnate into better people, and make a better movie.",1480118400,,1961,4.963525835866261

We almost turned it off; then stuck with it, and that was the only offensive language.  Other than that, it was a kind of interesting premise and pretty well done. I liked it better than my husband, because  I guess it might be considered a ""chick flick"". I was a little confused at times if it was the present or the past; a bit hard to follow. I love the line, ""don't confuse emotion with science."" (or something similar to that)...not everything can be explained thru science!  The movie was similar to some of the Nicholas Sparks books/movies. So if you like them, you would probably like this movie. A bit fake, but hey, so are most action pictures too.

7210532,4,B00YAZND1O,"This was a lovely movie. I found the concept original and yet it wasn't so out there to where I couldn't understand what was happening.
It is basically about two people who felt a connection with each other that was so strong they did not understand it. Then the girl begins to have memories that are not her own. And she comes to the conclusion that someone else's conscience as traveled across time and is in her. She remembers a man that her past conscience was in love with. They both died tragically and now it seems that these memories are leading her to someone who holds the key to the heart of her past.
Now I don't know how believable the story was. I was skeptical the whole time as to how someone could have the memories of another person from a different life, but in the context of the story it did happen and I think it was portrayed well. There are some weird things that happen to the the girl, but they all make sense in the end. All in all I enjoyed it for what it was.",1476748800,4,988,4.178010471204188

The script is tight, the acting is surprisingly top notch, and the story is sneaky-affecting.

7210667,4,B00YAZND1O,"""I Remember You"" is a pretty decent film. No it doesn't have all of the action and special effects like most movies today, but it a lower budget film. The actors all did a fantastic job in their roles, and I think the way that the story plays out is great. It does start off kind of slow, as you get to know the characters. Leah is obviously very brilliant, and is very involved in her job. She turns down invitations to go out after work to drink and mingle with co-workers, and she enjoys going for runs. Sam is trying to make it as an actor, and just lands a big role in the beginning of the film. He celebrates with some buddies, and that leads us to the drowning incident (alcohol induced) where he crosses paths with Leah. Their first few encounters are awkward, in my opinion. You can really see this connection that they both FEEL, but neither one says anything about it for a while. **SPOILER ALERT: When she goes to the doctor about her not showering for FOUR weeks, I was really confused. How was her hair still so clean and pretty? She was dehydrated and looking kind of sick, but I didn't realize she hadn't been showering until she said it out loud. If I didn't shower for that long, I'd look like a greaseball.** Also, Sam (for some reason) doesn't end up doing that job that he got in the beginning, so he has to go to more auditions, so you see him spiraling out of control. It ties up nicely at the end. I don't want to give too much away, in case someone hasn't seen it. I believe in reincarnation, so I enjoyed this story overall. I ended up crying the last five minutes. I have seen a lot of movies, and this is one that I would recommend to friends and family, as well as watch again. I received a complimentary DVD of this film for reviewing purposes.",1462665600,2,1774,4.2514792899408285
7210668,4,B00YAZND1O,"Writer/director Claudia Sparrow makes a strong impression with this little strangely beautiful romance of a story that explores science and physical love and the genetics of memory and possible previous lives. Sound too strange to work? The aspect that makes her film work so very well is the fact that it ignores the current obsession with Marvel comic book characters, zombies, or apocalyptic themes to make a story. Instead she elects to explore physical interaction bathed in the realm of possibilities of having experienced other lives, other bodies, other time, other fears, other loves.

Leah (Stefanie Butler) is a scientist whose life is her work in immunological cell research. She is a loner, preferring to take long walks and runs rather than mixing with friends in a bar after work. At the same time we meet Samuel (Joe Egender), a struggling young actor who finally gets a break in a film, but in celebration with his friend/manager he drinks too much and goes to the beach to romp in the ocean. Waves overcome him and he is near drowning when Leah jogs by on the pier and jumps in saves him. And hence a strange relationship develops  one that leads to reliving the past  and to say more would be a spoiler.

The young cast is excellent and with Claudias sensitive direction she makes these tow unlikely characters enter a meaningful relationship. The musical score is exquisite and the cinematography captures some very fine atmospheres  electing to let light and dark replace superficial sci-fi effects. There are some gaps in the editing that when corrected would make the film more graceful. But for a simple story well told and acted, I REMEMBER YOU explores and delivers.

7210670,5,B00YAZND1O,"Intriguing. Riveting. Charming. Compelling.

I didn't know what to expect when I was told about this movie, but I thought I'd give it a try. I love the idea of more movies with metaphysical intonations and concepts about more than just the reality we all see and think is real. This movie does not disappoint. Well-written, well-acted, well-directed - it has it all. Excellent choices in characters, as well as in plot and theme - it could've and should've been in mainstream theatres.

Overall, the trailer pretty well explains the movie, but as you watch, you become invested quickly and easily. What will they discover? How will it affect each of them? Consciousness memory and cell memory - can these be measured? The movie is more about the love story and less about the science (which makes it a great story leaving the watchers to choose their own conclusions) and I would highly recommend it. Excellent indie film with everything you could ask for - except a longer ending. I decidedly wanted to know how it would end long-term. Maybe that's for the sequel.

*Note: this movie was recommended to me by the director with an offer of a free watch for an honest review. I ended up buying the movie (sort of by accident and didn't get it for free), but I don't regret it. So, my review is still 100% my own.",1461369600,8,1311,4.594017094017094

One is convinced that they have met before;  the other isn't. I do not want to give more of the story away because it is exciting to watch it unfold.

7210733,1,B00YAZND1O,"Although this may look and feels like a real life Hollywood movie, and I can only imagine the actors, and parents of those actors, and friends of everyone involved, thought this was awesome because it seemed as if these people pulled of a Hollywood style movie, and as a result, probably were the people giving this film the 5 star reviews; this alone does NOT make this movie deserving of a 4.5 star rating. The pauses the actors make in their speech from the start is not realistic; most people would walk away if someone stops talking for that long a time. The speed of the movie was too slow in many parts and the movie did not flow well as a whole. But even if all that was perfect (and it was not even close), the story is not very good. I watched the movie from start to end. There are not many movies I dislike. I would say I like more types of movies than most people and I can tolerate almost the worst acting (from a supporting actor... not lead) if a story is good; however, this movie was a failed attempt to make a movie: from unbelievable acting (probably a product of the lack of proper direction/producing) and a no-name production company as well as a no-name director (I don't think there was one). Unless you know someone in this film, I would skip it; unless you want to see it if only to offset the 4.5 star rating.",1452470400,2,1337,4.288537549407114

Who was the Psychiatrist? I want to make sure I never waste a second of my life watching anything she had any part of. All of these 5 star ratings are either people who worked on the film, or people who were paid to leave reviews. How is this even classified as a Sci-Fi?

The acting was great, but the story itself needed something more to reveal the plot.  It had an interesting build up of the angst the main characters were feeling as they discovered themselves, but then it just went ""plop: here it is"".

But the last 15, 20 mins of the movie, where everything comes together, was beautiful (flashbacks to previous life) and made me believe that yes, love is eternal.  Good for a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1531180800,,308,4.5
8718025,4,B00YAZND1O,Just watched this on Netflix and if you're into bleakness and generally unhappy people experiencing the loss of children this is a good one. That may sound like a depressing plot but its actually pretty good and a decent ghost story with some rather surprising twists toward the end. Nothing really new here except the location but it was a pleasant surprise and the runtime wasn't too long.,1529712000,,391,4.764705882352941
8718026,3,B00YAZND1O,"Painfully drawn out, but the story was good. Just needed to delete about an hour of the film.",1528675200,,93,4.222222222222222
8718027,2,B00YAZND1O,"It's cheezy. I feel like i've ""seen it before"" which is sadly ironic to the plot. The concept was a little more orginal but I felt like the acting was so posed. The main guy's accent was very distracting as well for his acting and for the story. I really hated the accent. I feel like, as an actor, he should have been able to do a normal accent.",1528588800,,346,4.028985507246377

8718029,5,B00YAZND1O,Beautiful story. To those who believe in reencarnation and eternal love.,1527379200,,72,5.636363636363637
8718030,2,B00YAZND1O,"I really thought I'd like this, but found it to be disjointed, fragmented, slow and boring.",1525305600,,91,4.75
8718031,5,B00YAZND1O,"I bought this to get a photo-tour of beautiful Iceland, and to hear the Icelandic language. I was thrilled to unexpectedly get a very good horror story in addition! The story has plenty of supernatural, but not ridiculous, twists. Enough twists that I'm going to watch it again soon, because I'm sure I missed some details. Very well done film in all aspects. The cinematography of Iceland's landscape did not let me down. And I want to go there even more. (Assuming the disembodied spirits are truly just fiction!). Sadly the language still eludes me, and I'm afraid at my age I won't be learning it as a second language. Thumbs way up on the movie-- I'll be looking for more gems from Iceland's movie industry.",1524873600,,712,4.658730158730159
