2577245,5,B000FNNI4C,"I saw this film when it opened in New York after receiving a mention in Vanity Fair. The movie takes the best of The Player and The Kid Stays in The Picture and becomes even better. If you love Hollywood, this is the movie about how everything started. It is jammed packed with priceless ovitz, evans, zanuck and tons of others. I loved it. This is a must have for any movie lover collection.",1149292800,2,392,4.3108108108108105
2577246,5,B000FNNI4C,"I hope the release date is not really 2010. I saw this film in New York and was blown away. It is a slick look at Hollywood and the man who invented it , long before The Player and Kid Stays In The picture. Everyone is in it and it is a must see for anyone that loves the biz. The review in New York Times said it was absorbing and it was and more. The film passionately traces the career of super power Lew Wasserman under a tight scope with celebs like Ovitz, Valenti, Evans and even Jimmy Carter talking power. Can't wait to have my own copy.",1134604800,,545,4.009174311926605

2577260,5,B000FNNI4C,"Very well done.  It's more likely for people in the Entertainment Industry, which I was a part.  He had a great career.  There is a true and sad part of the story.  When you leave, whether by retirement, the Company is sold, or other reasons,  If, you are no longer in power, your phone does not ring as much.  Hollywood  has done that to about every Studio or Production Head.  No-one wants to talk to you anymore because you no longer can give you a job.  For me, it was especially great to learn more about his early history.  Lew Wasserman was ""The Last Mogul"".",1461024000,,565,4.295238095238095

2577273,1,B000FNNI4C,"Meh. Not extremely interesting. Delete the word ""Power"" from the English language and this become a silent documentary. I guess I learned a thing or two I didn't know but not a terrific trip.",1398124800,,191,4.647058823529412
2577274,5,B000FNNI4C,"Definitely worth watching. This docu fills in important gaps in the usual history if Hollywood, as seen through the eyes of the studio bosses or stars/ directors/ producers, etc. Wasserman was a classy, immensely talented and powerful genius.",1397520000,,242,5.394736842105263
2577275,4,B000FNNI4C,It is always interesting to see what goes on behind the scenes..  This was an interesting view how Hollywood worked during those years.,1397433600,,135,4.869565217391305
2577276,3,B000FNNI4C,"In this day of laws, regulation, and business practice standards there still exists an industry which just about does everything their own way. Anti-trust, fair and open dealing be damned. Ever want to know why that big chain movie theater down the street gets all the big movies and the independent theater owner nothing? Here is your answer. Using the government to help perpetuate their monopoly stranglehold on the business it is about who gets the money. Long live that $10 tub of popcorn.

Where there is an abundance of cash you will find these people. Wasserman knew how to make the system work well. Lou may be dead but the system certainly isn't.",1396137600,,656,4.754385964912281

2577278,5,B000FNNI4C,Great story that shows the rise and fall of one of the biggest Hollywood players ever. Great inside scoop. Thanks.,1395273600,,114,4.75
2577279,5,B000FNNI4C,"This movie describes this mans life from the birth to death, getting into history of Hollywood, politics, and much more. I found it to be very interesting from the beginning to the end!",1392595200,,185,4.636363636363637
2577280,5,B000FNNI4C,"For someone with no knowledge of Hollywood history, this was an exciting glimpse!
Highly recommend this book.  You will not regret.",1390867200,,131,5.238095238095238
2577281,5,B000FNNI4C,It was an extremely informative film about such an innovative and inspirational personality. I recommend it to any film connoisseur.,1387065600,,132,5.65
2577282,4,B000FNNI4C,"Very good documentary about Lew Wasserman. I heard lots of stories while working at Universal Studios about Lew Wasserman, it is since getting more background information. I watch a lot of documentaries and this one does not disappoint. A must watch for anyone interested in a behind the scenes look of how the entertainment industry works.",1377820800,,340,5.089285714285714
2577283,5,B000FNNI4C,Must watch. You'll look at the movie industry and Hollywood with a more informed eye. The documentary is truly superbly produced and narrated and offers a ton of original footage and pictures..I enjoyed it tremendously and recommend it to any one who's even half a movie buff.,1377388800,,276,4.8936170212765955
2577284,3,B000FNNI4C,"Very interesting documentary, just too exhaustive (and exhausting)-- could have been shorter and more effective. But I would recommend it to anyone fascinated by the inner workings and machinations of Hollywood.",1375056000,,211,5.838709677419355
2577285,1,B000FNNI4C,"This is a film about a man who abused power, and did whatever it took to get his way on his way to ""the top"".  He helped to build the junk industry we call Hollywood today.  That is nothing to be proud of.  In my view, this is yet another ""Hollywood makes a movie about Hollywood""; a self-aggrandizing, ongoing love-fest with itself.  Look at the qualities of films and television TV today.  Lew was one of the men who gave you that ""quality"".  What a terrible waste of power, and opportunity.  And what a terrible waste of time this movie is.  No thank you.",1374537600,5,558,4.298076923076923
2577286,4,B000FNNI4C,A true story of a Hollywood mogul and the power he had on the movie and media business. Real people telling the real story.,1374364800,,123,4.166666666666667

2577288,4,B000FNNI4C,"I give credit to anyone in the entertainment industry that can find at least 3 people who ""shed tears"" for someone with the power and wealth of Wasserman.  The true love many expressed in this movie was touching. It was a breath of fresh air for a movie to depict the truth which is: ""power becomes powerless at the end"" and also those at the top must watch out for the time they will have to pass the people they did not treat well when they start to lose their power. It's best to be a good person of purpose and a happy heart no matter what,,,,",1373155200,,547,4.11214953271028

2577290,5,B000FNNI4C,This is a very well done film that paints a very good picture of how Hollywood evolved and Lew Wasserman's place role. It has a little mob and a little political story lines that make it even more interesting.,1365292800,,209,4.384615384615385
2577291,5,B000FNNI4C,"With iTunes, downloading, 99 cent songs and the devaluation of music and movies, how the industry was built is a fascination and a mystery, What people miss about what made entertainment so compelling wasn't the lack of options, but the charismatic visionaries forging the path.
This in-depth look at Lew Wasserman pulls back the curtain on the kind of personality, the struggle and the challenges stood down to. Another time, a larger than life character and a path to something that gave so much pleasure to so many. The stuff you never think of, the power games that mostly go unseen.",1362873600,,587,4.821782178217822
2577292,5,B000FNNI4C,Not this is what I'm talking about this is a great Hollywood doc I love knowing the backstory and dirty dealings of these major studios so my review is to tell you this is a great doc and I am not going to spoil the story just know its a very well done documentary.,1359331200,,265,3.925925925925926
2577293,4,B000FNNI4C,"The name Wasserman meant power in Hollywood for more that forty years, his rise and gradual fade out are chronicled in this very good DVD.  The film highlights the reason's why this poor Jewish kid from east Cleveland was able to rise to such great heights.  It's interesting how his connection to the Jewish mob and his fortuitous mentorship by Jules Stein, propelled him to the pinnacle of Hollywood power, eventually overshadowing Stein himself.  Wasserman is something of an enigma and the weakness of this documentary is that it has no real interview with Wasserman himself, not even archieval, the man was infamously private, like a great hollywood vapor.  Without this, it's hard to really get a feel for this ruthless, yet seemingly elegant man.  It appears the filmakers did the best they could to flesh out this sort of Citizen Kane, but in the end, I still couldn't help but wonder, who was this guy, really?  It's a shame the filmmakers could not get his wife to speak, one has the feeling she knows all and as such is anyone surprised she is as much of a phantom in this film as he is?",1213574400,3,1098,4.605128205128205
2577294,1,B000FNNI4C,"When the film business has to resort to making tedious biographical movies about its pencil pushers and accountants (Lew Wasserman, head of MCA), you know it has as much culturance relevance as a Sunday newspaper insert from Wal-Mart. The worst sign of a boring, bromide of a movie is when Larry King turns up in the first five minutes to offer his asinine comments. This movie is heavy on interviews of kneecap-kissing milquetoasts, and short of anything interesting. It's a talkfest among a wrinkle-room of blowhards pontificating about how powerful Lew (Who?) Wasserman was back in the day of this and that, and so what? This film is great for any nostalgia fan who longs for the day when a company executive could push his secretaries around all day without fear of a sexual harassment suit. Bo-ring!!!!",1171497600,7,807,4.897810218978102
2577295,4,B000FNNI4C,"Now I know that Lew Wasserman was a very powerful and influential personality, that his sphere of influence surpassed the world of showbusiness. (According to this movie he practically created Ronald Reagan as a politician). But I still do not understand in what way he influenced society, which would be interesting to know - but which maybe is a subject too deep and complex for a filmed documentary. This movie is well made (great musical soundtrack) and certainly entertaining. Even in old age Mr Wasserman was an attractive and telegenic man - it almost seems a pity he only acted behind the set.",1167782400,2,601,4.844660194174757
2577296,4,B000FNNI4C,"For those that thought Marlon Brando was the only ""Godfather"" in Hollywood, this dvd will introduce you to the real one -Lew Wasserman.

Super-agent, super-mogul and super-powerful. From Cleveland to Hollywood to the White House, this documentary lays out the life of a man through those that knew, loved and feared him. Lew was not a man that gave many interviews, least none on film and he was not one to write things down either. He firmly believed in keeping an ultra-low profile, unless you had to deal with him personally and then -watch out!

The master of the deal, he personally managed client Ronald Reagan and remade him as the ""Great Communicator"". From the Screen Actor's Guild presidency, to the Governorship of California and finally the ultimate starring role playing the White House. And Wasserman was supposed to be the Democratic half of the MCA team. That is the Music Corporation of America, which Lew really elevated out of the band booking business, into the biggest talent agency ever seen. It's all here, along with the ""real"" tour of Universal Studios. The one that the tram guides are not allowed to talk about. But overall, Lew Wasserman comes out of this pretty well considering his ""alleged"" mob affliations. A necessary evil that at least got things done and maintained some kind of order in Hollywood. Ruthlessly shrewd, cunning and even at times sentimental, he created the monster that has become the new Hollywood. Where it's all about the deal and the packaging of style over substance.

May I suggest for those that want to learn more and see everything laid out and documented in black & white, a few good books on Amazon- ""Mr. & Mrs. Hollywood"" by Kathleen Sharp; ""The Last Mogul"" book that is by Dennis McDougal; ""When Hollywood Had A King"" by Connie Bruck and finally the investigative expose that blazed the way ""Dark Victory -Reagan, MCA & The Mob"" by Dan Moldea!",1167004800,12,1906,4.82262996941896
