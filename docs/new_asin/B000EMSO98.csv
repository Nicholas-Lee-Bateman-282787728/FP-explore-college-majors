8111471,3,B000EMSO98,"This budget DVD from Mill Creek Entertainment has three movies on one disc: two depressing, sappy dramas starring Jose Jose and a solid, musically themed drama starring Cesar Costa, Libertad Lamarque, and Angelica Maria.
)Buscando una Sonrisa(Looking for a Smile)
)El Cielo y La Tierra(Heaven and Earth)
)Un Sueno de Amor(A Dream of Love)

I really liked El Cielo y La Tierra. Although, Mill Creek must've mastered it off another DVD. An icon that reads ""go to songs"" keeps popping up. I tried to select it only to realize it was part of the movie!!! Not a must buy, but you get three decent movies for one low price!",1208044800,3,617,4.660550458715596
