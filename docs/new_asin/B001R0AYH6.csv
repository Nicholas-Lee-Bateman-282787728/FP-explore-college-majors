8336933,5,B001R0AYH6,I love this show! I watched it while it was airing on tv. I am a singer and it is always a pleasure to watch shows that have good music and are based on singers. I also like it because it isn't fake. The actress is really singing and she is good. Anyway it had been years since I had seen this show and I saw it on here and it wasn't expensive so I bought it. I am very glad that I did. I am buying the rest of the seasons sometime in the future.,1343347200,,446,3.65625
8336934,4,B001R0AYH6,"I am a huge fan of Instant Star. In it's short run, it has been a fun, wonderful program.

The DVD is great for just that, watching episodes of Instant Star. However, I would not purchase this looking for any special extras or even a well-designed set of menus.

The program is great, and this is a wonderful way if you're just looking to watch and enjoy.",1327363200,,355,4.2835820895522385

8336936,3,B001R0AYH6,"I like the show becuse of the songs, but the teenage problems and the ""all for love"" theme is a bit overwhelming and tiresome.... but still like the show, I recommend to buy it, as it's entertaining and better than just sitting with the cd of music.",1280188800,,249,4.319148936170213
