8035810,5,B000317LSU,Gotta disagree with a review above.  One pronounced advantage of getting an import DVD is that it's usually NOT copyguard-encoded as are virtually all U.S. versions...not that I'd engage in piracy (!)...no; just that it's nice to be able to edit down a copy of my own recorded work  ( which Congress says is legal: one backup copy for yourself ).  Sound and picture exceeded my wildest expectations.  Great show!,1107129600,2,412,4.8428571428571425
8035811,1,B000317LSU,"To those of you that LOVE Deep Purple as I do, wait... wait just a little while longer. Help is on the way. The OFFICIAL version of the California Jam Deep Purple gig on DVD is to be released soon... so say the folks at Purple-Records.com.  I bought one of these South American knock-offs from a seller on eBay and... well, it sux. My old VHS version I got mail-order from Japan in 1984 still looks and ESPECIALLY sounds soooooo much better than these cheap DVD's being sold out of South America. Just wait a little while longer, and keep an eye on the Deep Purple website, theHighwayStar.com for news of the official release. I know it will be worth waiting for. Trust me on this one folks. Nobody collects DP video like I have over the years... nobody.",1106092800,6,754,4.424460431654676
