5622453,5,B00BI6SPLG,"I caught this at Fantastic Fest in Austin and let me tell you, despite this film being nominally a documentary, the real life exorcism of a Colombian woman is captivating, disturbing and really makes you think there might be something to exorcisms, even if you don't really believe in religion.

The film follows Father Fortea, the only Vatican authorized exorcist in Spain (he speaks good English luckily) as he tours the world as a sort of Catholic Superstar. People are desperate for an audience with him and no kidding, he preaches in huge venues.

Also featured is the Vatican's top exorcist, Gabriele Amorth, who looks really scary but turns out to be a kind, funny guy.

Well worth the price of admission and Highly Recommended!",1361577600,24,735,4.864

5622468,5,B00BI6SPLG,Way above expectations. This documentary presents a balanced and sound explanation of the ministry of exorcism that was given to the apostles by Jesus and has been handed on through the Church for over 2000 years. It shows the great need for this ministry in our times in which people are surrounded by the darkness of pagan ideas and so much in need of the light of Christ. Some scenes might seem a bit theratical but unless we accept the reality that demons are real and do carry on a war with men then we cannot understand or appreciate why we need Jesus as our Savior.

5622471,2,B00BI6SPLG,"Given the fascinating subject, it's a wonder this documentary proves to be such a slow, plodding and uninteresting look at the true lives of the world's exorcists. Largely just a series of interviews with various priests and a few psychiatric professionals, the informational aspects of this piece could probably be boiled down to half the running length. There are 2 or 3 exorcism ceremonies depicted but they are, as you might expect, fairly boring. The  ""possessed"" could easily be dismissed as mentally ill or attention-seeking. There's certainly nothing that appears in the documentary that would cause one to believe that they are actually being influenced by a preternatural spirit. I will say that the documentary is at least balanced enough to give voice to the the point of view (which I maintain) that faith itself causes susceptible people to believe they are possessed and act out on those beliefs.",1427155200,,911,5.114093959731544
5622472,1,B00BI6SPLG,"Unlike well made documentaries this does not as others do focus on the priest how the possession began and how he became involved, I just like more in depth details. It jumps around, after a while it became overly annoying because it is like when you skim through a murder mystery book you miss all the juicy details leading up to it. I watched one called [ The Possessed ] it was good. Suggestion for great documentaries below

Excellent possession documentary style films

1 The Devil Inside ( 2012 )

In Rome a possessed woman Maria Rossi during an exorcism kills 3 people, and is a resident in a Catholic psychiatric ward. The film shows how 20 years later her daughter Isabella who is making a documentary comes to see her Isabella begins searching for information about how it all began and what happened. During a visit with her mom Maria begins revealing things about her daughter that she could not possibly know about since Isabella never told anyone her secrets

2 The Rite (2011 ) based on real life events

The film is based on Matt Baglio's Book The Rite. The Making of a Modern Exorcist and real life events. Anthony Hopkins stars as Father Gary Thomas and gives an excellent portrayal of an exorcist for the Vatican in Rome. Father Thomas handles various cases of demonic possession and activity from mild to severe. Most interesting is the case of a demon possessed pregnant teenage Italian girl with a dark shocking secret he is working with it leads up to the most shocking and  horrifying events and discoveries, this is an excellent movie

3 The Conjuring (2013 ) based on real life events

Based on a real life case of demonic possession in which demonology experts and paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren who were brought in to investigate help with and document the the case of the presence of an evil entity terrifying a family living in a farmhouse in Rhode Island and the horrific events that follow of. This is an excellent well made and as scary as the Exorcist and this even scared the hell out of me a die hard horror fan",1425945600,,2064,4.604904632152588

5622481,4,B00BI6SPLG,This documentary was quite well done and informative. I gave it four stars bc it is a bit slow in places. Given the topic that was an accomplishment in and of itself. If they were attempting to merely share information without over-sensationalizing the subject it is a 5 star effort. I was touched by the priests interviewed. Typically we meet Vatican scholar priests in these types of pieces. It was nice to meet warmer priests who are working day to day with people who really need help and support.  I tend to believe that science will find our answers so it was good for me to see that outside of the 'answers' there is a fundamental truth that caring for people can be more important than 'why'. It is good to be a seeker of the truth but at the same time so many people are suffering. I think it was the sheer volume of people from around the world who felt empty and needed help that made me rethink some of my own beliefs about exorcism. In the beginning I was rolling my eyes as people fell back onto others as they were prayed over but by the end I saw I would be better served to judge my own indifference. I saw things more through the eyes of the people who were asking for help. I do not believe that all if these people need an exorcism and I do believe mental illness is a huge factor (which is actually the position of the Vatican) but then what? So we just thrown our hands in the air and walk away? I was ashamed by my lack of compassion which stems from my own intolerant beliefs and faith in science. These priests had far far more compassion than I do. They are walking the walk. Science can't explain everything and people still need support. A true seeker is open to all possibilities. I am glad I saw this.,1415404800,2,1731,4.261398176291793

There is no in depth anything, and the focus of the movie is on the priest who has permission to perform exorcisms, not the actual exorcism. He can only perform exorcisms within his local diocese which I do not think he even went to. It was a lot of accents, subtitles, and flashing colors on a screen. I would not watch this again, and regret having watched it now. I am always interested in what other priests are going through, but people probably know more about me from face book, than I know about him after this movie. The people who speak on camera about wanting an exorcism are people who do not seem to meet the criteria for one. I am thankful they did not dramatize their situation but again, blah, blah, blah, flashing lights....accents, subtitles. I reckon in some way that kind of seems like a spoiler....

The women claimed to be possessed was inconclusive, no evidence for or against her case of possession. She was exorcised by a non-Catholic bishop, giving one the impression that the Catholic church couldn't find enough evidence of possession for an exorcism.

5622525,1,B00BI6SPLG,"The subject of this film is the novus ordo ""priest"" and exorcist Jos&eacute; Antonio Fortea. Initially I liked him; I liked him less as the film progressed; by film's end, when he states he has the gift of tongues and wants to speak a prayer in tongues over anyone watching the film, I was repulsed. I'd prefer having a validly ordained Roman Catholic priest saying prayers in Latin over me, thank you very much.

The film's fair enough the first hour. Those viewers wishing to see an actual exorcism will not be disappointed. But it is not Jos&eacute; Antonio Fortea doing it. Fortea never exorcises anyone during this film. He travels extensively to waiting throngs, occasionally plugging his book on exorcism. By and by, he lays his hand on members of these throngs and they fall backwards to the floor in a swoon - the ""slain in the spirit"" phenomenon usually associated with charismatics. By and by, Fortea prays [in tongues?] over the throngs and, as his praying progresses, more and more writhing females are extracted from the throng and physically restrained on the floor - and yet not one ""Catholic"" in the whole throng, that I could see, makes the sign of the cross while this macabre spectacle escalates.

Entreated by a possessed woman to exorcise her, Fortea declines - he's working on his doctorate and out of his diocese. His advice? To ""find a prayer group full of love"", because that will make what is in her ""weaker and weaker"". Fortea doesn't mention a *Catholic* prayer group, he doesn't mention reciting the Holy Rosary, he doesn't mention a general confession, he doesn't mention penance, he doesn't mention hanging a Benedictine crucifix or wearing a St. Benedict medal, he doesn't mention wearing a scapular or a Miraculous Medal, he doesn't mention invocations to Our Lady, St. Michael, St. Benedict, St. Joseph - which are what a valid Roman Catholic priest would recommend. For starters.

The film includes brief interviews: Vatican exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth extols exorcists as the elite of the priesthood; a secular psychiatrist affirms the power of prescription drugs and therapy to solve people's problems; a heretical novus ordo ""priest"" named Juan Masia decries exorcists and denies the reality of both exorcism and the devil: ""{The devil is only] a symbol...of that enigma of evil.... If an exorcist tells [someone that he or she is possessed], that exorcist is causing psychological evil.""

It's a disturbing film because it portrays the rampant lack of orthodoxy, the ineffectiveness, the downright spiritual creepiness of the truly bizarre novus ordo ""church"". My gut reaction, which I cannot back up with logic, but nevertheless was quite visceral, was that Jos&eacute; Antonio Ortega is a carrier of the spiritual disease he's tasked to cure. That's a harsh statement. I mean no unfairness to the man. If I were wrong I'd glad to be so and would be ashamed to have suggested such a thing. It's just a gut reaction. A very strong gut reaction. By film's end, I regretted watching it.

Yes, I'm a believer in our free will, temptations, influence of demons in the actions of humans, and in most advanced cases - true possession.

I've read other books on this topic and have seen  MUCH better movies on the topic.

I can not recommend this video.  The possessed person writhes and screams but nothing extraordinary; it seems like acting to me, although it probably was not.  You are  better off spending your time with other materials about the topic.

I'd recommend  other videos and books from Amazon:  ""The Exorcist"" (1973)  released as Director's Cut (Extended Edition) - $6.98  or ""The Rite"".  Both are based on real life events with some Hollywood liberties (dramatizations of the facts or scenes that did not occur)  thrown in.  Both have enough aspects of truth, are entertaining to keep your interest, and should open one's eyes to the reality of possession.

There are several books about exorcism available at Amazon.  ""An Exorcist Tells His Story"" (a good book about the different ways evil enters one's life and much more),  ""The Rite"" by Matt Baglio,  ""The Dark Sacrament"" (10 true stories),  ""The Demonologist""  by Gerald Brittle.  and ""Possessed"" by Thomas Allen  (basis for The Exorcist movie).

Remember - good is stronger than evil, and never despair or lose hope.  Pray, hope and don't worry- trust.  If you feel you or someone in your family is possessed, do some research  (start with ""An Exorcist Tells His Story""), and your physician, before contacting your local pastor or  bishop.

5622534,1,B00BI6SPLG,"I rented this documentary from my local library and was shocked at various elements. A nice and tight expose that encompasses all areas (favorable as well as unfavorable) would be wonderful, but a direct and plain approach might be better for the purposes of Amazon.

What follows is a list of problematic aspects to the documentary:

1) Fr. Fortea is seen walking into a stadium blessing people like he was a Bishop. Under Catholic liturgical law, this is highly suspect. It also gives rise to the suspicion that Fr. Fortea may have let fame go to his head.

2) Fortea tells the woman ""Constanza"" that he is writing/studying for his doctoral dissertation and cannot help her at that time. He then tells her it is the Will of God that she find a prayer community that ""loves God."" This was not the smartest or most pastoral thing to say...

3) ...because ""Constanza"" then goes to some fake ""bishop"" of the ""Renovated Catholic Church"" which is N-O-T Catholic! Moreover, how does Fr. Fortea know what is and what is not the Will of God for this woman?

4) Fr. Fortea, in the epilogue of the video, claims he ""does not say"" on camera that he has the gift of tongues because he feared it would have an adverse effect on people. Yet throughout the video he is seen (allegedly) exercising this ""gift."" To claim he ""did not say"" is an empty distinction. If you ""do"" it, then you ""claim"" it. For the record, he then proceeds in said epilogue to perform this alleged gift.

Moreover, it is arguably more disconcerting on people to witness the (alleged) gift of tongues in action than simply to claim one has it. Even St. Paul seemed to understand this (1 Corinthians 12:22-26).

Lastly on this point, who has discerned that Fr. Fortea truly has this gift? Are we to take him at face value without knowing anything about his (apparent) claim to this particular extraordinary gift?

5) St. Paul says there has to be an interpreter present when someone is speaking in tongues (1 Corinthians 12:27-28). Not once is such a person to be found--or at least not portrayed--during this documentary. Therefore, how does one know whether or not he or she was listening to people blaspheming God in a foreign language?

6) Related to #5, that people are truly speaking in tongues is a foregone--but not proven--conclusion in the video. This is misleading to the general public and leaves the cause of religion wide open for attack by skeptics and critics.

7) Since when was the authentic gift of speaking in tongues associated with exorcism? It appears this is a profane novelty of recent invention.

8) Possible liturgical abuse: what was going on during the Holy Hour shown at the end of the documentary hardly looked anything remotely like Catholic worship. It looked more like a Protestant ""praise"" session with a little dab of Blessed Sacrament and dangling rosaries to put on the airs of Catholicism.

9) It is questionable for Fr. Fortea, a Catholic Bishop in Norway(?) and another priest to be in a documentary that gives credence to the fake ""renovated"" Church mentioned above.

10) Another priest named Fr. Juan Masia of the University of Sophia in Japan is shown twice in this documentary. From his two appearances, one becomes highly suspicious that Masia has been deeply infected with the heresy of neo-Modernism.

Masia horribly mangles the Gospel story (Matthew 9:20-22) of the woman with a hemorrhage in an attempt to deny the existence of the devil and his demons. At the end of his protracted explanation which turns evil into a sociological factor (i.e. the only evil is social stigmatization), Masia then wraps up with an appeal (no doubt meant by Masia to be a flourish) to the Greek text for ""saved"" (sesoken) when all he does is become a shining example of why neo-Modernism is a heresy.

Interestingly, a redeeming quality to the video can be found at this point.

In a stroke of genius on the part of the documentary's editorial department, Masia's first appearance and remarks come before Fr. Fortea gives a discussion on how theologians of the 1970s interpreted Scripture incorrectly. By the juxtaposition, Masia is shown as CLEARLY representing said 1970s school of Scriptural interpretation.

In the end, if one is truly interested in watching this documentary, it would be best first to become educated in Catholic theology from reputable sources. Otherwise, one could run the risk of receiving the wrong impressions that are rampant in this film.

True, there are some good things here and there, but this review is largely critical so as to underscore the serious moral obligation one has before God not to expose his or herself to materials that could harm faith and good morals.",1392336000,7,4692,4.814676616915423

Jesus cast out demons and gave His disciples the authority to do so too.  This is something beyond human science... the woman Costanza was being prescribed increasing doses of antidepressants by her doctor, but it wasn't addressing her problem.  Thank God for her boyfriend who did research and sought out spiritual help through the Church.

SPOILER: You could see Constanza starting to get better towards the end of the film.  (For me, her humble resignation to God's will is a beautiful fruit of the Holy Spirit.)  The exorcism process, however, was not shown to completion.  The ending was left very much open-ended.  Which is a shame, because people who may be going through spiritual attacks could benefit from knowing more fully about how to be delivered.  Although the deliverance part is missing, this documentary still presents a lot of useful information, and exclusive access into very private matters.

My mom instantly recognized Father Fortea, who was a speaker at the SCRC Convention a couple years ago.  She really loves him, as he exudes a deep humility and devotion for the Lord.  One of the things I learned from him through this documentary is that some of the possessors have revealed themselves to be Judas Iscariot, Nero, and even Hitler.  This coincides with private revelation that I've read that Judas and Hitler are in hell (reference: Maria Valtorta's 1943 Notebooks and interviews with Maria Simma in the book ""Get Us Out of Here!!"").

It was interesting to hear the priests' comments on the movie ""The Exorcist.""  I wasn't expecting that.  And then my mom asked why all the possessed people in the documentary were women.  In the case of Constanza, the demonic spirit revealed that Constanza had allowed hatred and unforgiveness towards her father to grow.  Constanza herself said that she was leading a life without God, without faith prior to seeking help from the Church.

I wish there was more spiritual advice for avoiding possessions in the first place.  I mean, isn't the best medicine the preventative kind?  From my limited understanding, generational sin, curses, occultism, and certain New Age practices can open up doors.  Your soul is such a valuable thing... watching Constanza suffer so much, you really pray for her to become free again.  In the mighty name of Jesus, let us pray...

P.S. We should also pray for priests who have fallen into the heresy that the devil is not a person but just a ""symbol"" of evil.  That was quite shocking to hear, and a reminder that the Church is under severe attack by the Evil One.",1391126400,10,3030,4.913385826771654
5622537,2,B00BI6SPLG,"For me this documentary held no new information, it barely had a story line, and seemed phony. The scenes of possessions were almost laughable. I wasn't convinced that the poor girls in the videos needed anything but a good psychiatrist.",1390348800,2,237,4.95
5622538,5,B00BI6SPLG,"Well, It is a excellent documentary realyy, but what I most liked in this dvd was to watch the bonus interview with Father Fortea. It is uncommon to find real spiritualized persons in orthodox religions, because the most of them only seems a worker in their job, focused more in external formalities. Father Fortea seems a exception, and he shows a real spiritual  understanding of the matters he talk about. Well, but I bought this DVD to see a real exorcism, because, while I have none beliefs, and live in Brazil, a country where the Spiritualism is the main belief. I was a little curious to see  how a  pure catholic phenomena in action. Well, some people say to see a confirmation of their faith in this dvd, but sincerely, I think all that you can see in the exorcism presented in this dvd is the confirmation of was written in Kardec The Spirits Book:

473. Can a spirit temporarily assume the envelope of a living person--that is to say, can he introduce himself into an animate body, and act in the room and place of the spirit
incarnated in it?

""A spirit does not enter into a body as you enter into a house. He assimilates himself to an
incarnate spirit who has the same defects and the same qualities as himself, in order that they may act conjointly; hut it is always the incarnate spirit who acts at his pleasure on the matter with which he is clothed. No other spirit can substitute himself in the place of the spirit who is incarnated in a given body, for a spirit is indissolubly united with his body until the arrival of the hour that has been appointed by Providence for the termination of his material existence.""

474. If there be no such thing as possession"", in the ordinary sense of that term-that is tosay, cohabitation of two spirits in the same body-is it possible for one soul to find itself dominated, subjugated, obsessed by another soul to such a point as that its will is, so to say,  paralysed?

""Yes; and it is this domination which really constitutes what you call possession. But you must understand that this domination is never established without the participation of the spirit who is subjected to it, either through his weakness or his free-will. Men have often mistaken for cases of possession what were really cases of epilepsy or madness, demanding the help of the physician rather than of the exorciser.""

476. Might not the fascination exercised by the evil spirit be so complete that the person subjugated should be unaware of it; and, in such a case, might not a third person be able to put an end to the subjection? And what course should be taken by the latter to that end?

""The will-power of an upright man may be useful by attracting the co-operation of good  spirits in the work of deliverance; for the more upright a man is, the more power he possesses, both over imperfect spirits to drive them away, and over good ones to draw them nearer. Nevertheless, even the best of men would be powerless in such a case, unless the subjugated person lent himself to the efforts made on his behalf, for there are persons who take delight in a state of dependence which panders to their depraved tastes and desires. In no case can one who is impure in heart exercise any liberating influence, for he is despised by the good spirits, and the bad ones stand in no awe of him.""

477. Have formulas of exorcism any power over bad spirits?

""No; when bad spirits see any one seriously endeavouring to act upon them by such means, they laugh at him, and persist in their obsession.""",1389484800,,3522,4.545023696682464
5622539,4,B00BI6SPLG,"Though this film barely touches the surface of this deep, theologically rich topic that has extra significance in our world today, it's a good beginning look at the topic. Fr. Fortea is a well known and often quoted expert in the field. I don't believe the film gives him the canvas to detail the topic adequately for the average viewer, though those familiar will pick up much more from the story. I worry that the theatrics displayed will frighten/discourage some from taking this topic seriously. What is shown is not always the way this is approached in ministry, and there was a missed opportunity for the film to have clarified much more on this. The Chruch's modern stand on treatment of posession is solidly based in medicine, science and behavioral studies acting in cooperation with the Faith and it's Traditions in determining what is best for those afflicted. The combination of science and Faith is not always easy, even within the ranks of clergy, as is noted. Those who believe in what the Church teaches, will believe and follow, for various reasons. Those who do not, won't, also for many (sometimes personally good) reasons. In sympathy for the subject couple, some may wonder at the outcome of their journey. The film can not explain in the necessary depth why the results reached are not what is normally seen in literature/cinema to entertain, as this is real. This film requires a careful screening and some familiarity along with a mind open to the truth of demonic interference in our world. It is a good beginning to the journey of mind and heart in Faith on a vital topic. I encourage all who have questions toward further study after viewing, seeking more traditional rather than more sensational sources of information. It will certainly expand your horizons, and perhaps deepen your faith.",1389225600,4,1818,4.88673139158576

In case anybody should think I found it boring because there was no spectacular manifestations or spewing pea-soup, think again, one of my favourite exorcist/possession movies was Requiem and that does not contain any gore or amazing stunts, but it was completely and utterly creepy and played on my mind for a long time afterwards.

Exorcist in the 21st Century just left me utterly cold even though it was a documentary rather than just a movie.",1374969600,2,665,4.6752136752136755

5622560,4,B00BI6SPLG,"This is a very well made documentary following the path of the only exorcist in the whole of Spain, Fr. Jose Antonio Fortea, who is a man of great wisdom and eloquence, presents to us the forgotten world of exorcisms and the continued battle that mankind faces with the invisible forces of darkness. We are taken in a step by step manner into the world of the demonic and taught the many ways, situations and events that can lead to a demonic influence i,e, primarily through occultism, neo-paganism and witchcraft. The need for such holy men is very apparent in a world that thinks itself beyond such 'medieval' ideas.
In this documentary we meet Constanza, a very disturbed woman, who is apparently under the influence of an evil entity and her heart breaking yet earnest disire for spiritual liberation.

What I particularly like about this presentation is that we see opponents of the office of exorcist....one a modernist Catholic priest and a psychiatrist. However be rest assured the exorcists arguments bear infinetly more weight than the rationalistic and pathetic explanations of these 2 individuals. I would excuse the doctor....but definitely not the priest!(Just my opinion but this modern priest without his knowledge is actually doing the devil the greatest service!)
The struggle that the exorcists have to be accepted and respected by fellow priests is very palpable. But all in all there is a great serenity about them, for you know and see that God is on their side.

Guest appearances in this DVD include Fr. Gabriel Amorth the Vatican's chief exorcist, The Catholic Bishop of Norway and an exorcist priest from the same country.
Bonus features include extended interviews with Fr. Gabriel Amorth, with Fr. Fortea and the rather unsuccesful exorcism of Costanza from an apparently schismatic bishop of Colombia who seems to run his own church (.......???).
The depth of knowledge that one can gain from the interviews alone is worth purchasing this DVD.

However I would like to add that what I did not like about this documentary, was the very charismatic nature of worship in Latin America that was portrayed. and the ' speaking in tongues' which is a gift of the Holy Ghost, however not the most important. That was just not my cup of tea.
The subtitles are literally word for word and are not the best really. It takes some effort to undertand and are in English only.
The documentary is 80 minutes long with 114 minutes of the afore mentioned bonus features.
I also recommend the following as aids to deepen our knowledge about this ministry.

5622563,5,B00BI6SPLG,"The Exorcist in the 21st Century is a chilling examination of the unknown and sinister world of exorcism in the Catholic Church.

Granted unprecedented access by The Church, filmmaker Fredrik Horn Akselsen brings you into the secret and mystical world of Catholic exorcism. Allowed to accompany one of the few Vatican approved exorcists, Father Jos Antonio Fortea, you experience the mystical rite through the story of Constanza, a Colombian woman who claims to have been possessed by demons for 15 years. She sees the Spanish exorcist as her last hope for spiritual liberation.

Captured in a compelling and dramatic fashion, the on-camera casting out of demons is every bit as disturbing as anything Hollywood could conjure up. And the bonus footage of a real-life exorcism is a must-view for anyone interested in this subject.

8568895,1,B00BI6SPLG,"I was surprised with all the reviews feeling that the girl wasn't possessed and acted the whole thing.  Was she possessed?  I don't know but I do know that the devil has people fooled into thinking that you have to hover in the air and turn your head completely around to be possesed.  This is simply not true.  In the bible Jesus cast out a evil spirit from a man that was in the synagogue with him.  So Im sure the man looked and acted fine with the rest of the people to be sitting in church or do you think he was hoovering around and turning his head in circles at the church?  Mark 1:23-27  In fact,  according to the bible you may personaly know people who display symptoms of evil spirits.  One bible example sounds like a boy suffering from epiliptic seazures.  He faometh and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away.  Mark 9:17 -  27.  Another lady sufferend from a humped back that was caused by a spirit. Luke 13:10 - 17.
 But here is a trick the devil is playing now by giving certain church members ability to cast out evil spirits which in turn, appear to blind non bible reading people an impression of God approving the church with its man made traditions.  On judgement day many people will say to Jesus.  Lord, have we not prophesised, CAST OUT DEVILS, and done many wonderful works in you name. And Jesus will respond and say I NEVER KNEW YOU, DEPART FROM ME , YE THAT WORK INIQUITY. Matthew 7:22-23  These people thought they knew God but was tricked by the devil.  Iniquity is breaking Gods commandments and most christian churches today break two of Gods 10 commandments.  They teach others to rest on the first day of the week Sunday instead of the seventh day of the week which is Saturday.  And they teach people to bow down and adore false gods made with human hands.  Which is exaclty what God sees when you give admoration to any man made or earthly religous item incuding the cross and religous pictures.  The devil has used that same trick on the children of Israel to make God angry and they too thought they were giving honour to God and doing good in his sight.  They too had blind religous leaders that stopped following the bible to know how God wants to be worshipped.  Exodus 20:1-6, Duet 4:23-25, Jer 7:30, Ezek 5:11, Isaiah 2:8, 36:7, 42:8, 44:15-19, 2Kings 22,23:1-25,  1Kings 12:26 - 32 2Chron 13:1-23",1476576000,,2343,4.443661971830986
