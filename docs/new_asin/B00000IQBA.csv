7911289,5,B00000IQBA,"I'm buying the DVD as my old video tape of this amazing film is not functioning any more. Deni Delory and Richard Horian are surperb. The sets are fabulous and the lack of words actually enhances the effect of this film. I find myself totally engrossed in every small movement of each person in the cast. If you enjoy a film that captures your attention and holds it, you might enjoy this one. The music, of course, is fabulous and the director, Mr. Horian, has matched the emotional impact of the acting to the score.",1465516800,,518,4.463157894736842
