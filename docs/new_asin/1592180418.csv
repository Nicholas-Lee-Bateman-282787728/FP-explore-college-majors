200480,5,1592180418,FABULOUS ACTUAL ACCOUNT WITH REAL FOOTAGE. TRUE STORIES OF REAL HEROS NEVER BEFORE AWARDED THEIR DUE.  ESPECIALLY FLYING ALL THOSE TROOPERS IN UNDER ENEMY LINES IN THE DARK .  A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND STORY.,1190160000,5,204,4.8
200481,5,1592180418,"A month ago a man in my late father's platoon set me the DVD ""Silent Wings"" the story of American glider pilots during World War II. Since this man, Bill Shorter and my Dad Charles Wilber were glider riders I found this nearly 2-hour documentary very informative and a pleasure to watch. Many Americans don't realize that the gliders were an important and dangerous part of the American airborne forces during that war. Using interviews with both German and American glider pilots along with great insite by reporters Walter Cronkite and Andy Rooney the DVD was excellant. It not only showed American glider action but also German glider assualts. I recommend this documentary for not only WWII buffs but anyone interested in history.",1186272000,16,734,4.975609756097561
200482,5,1592180418,"When my graduating grandson (heading for college) asked me about ""gliders"" in wartime for an essay on WWII, my interest in anything that flies answered some of his questions, and to reinforce it, I got him the copy of Silent Wings and that gave him a better documented story; bravery, heroism, victory and tragedy.",1184371200,7,314,4.833333333333333
200483,5,1592180418,"They all volunteered - to serve in a branch of the service that no longer exists. They knew they were to be pilots on a one-way mission. Fly them in and then grab a rifle and join the infantry. That was the lot of a Glider Pilot. The G on their wings surely stood for ""Guts""

Watch this exciting tape and you will certainly want to tip your hat to the few living veterans of this extrodinary branch of the Army Air Corp.",1179100800,21,420,4.0602409638554215

200491,4,1592180418,"I believe this wasn't as good as it should have been. It had what I thought was a very interesting subject to cover, but I had trouble staying interested in it. That is a strong statement from me, because I am a history BUFF. Back in the days when the History Channel actually showed HISTORY, I would have been totally happy if that were the only channel, with the exception of Discovery and The Learning Channel. Of course, that was back when they showed educational stuff, too. It seems like another era! Anyway, didn't mean to get off track, but this documentary just didn't seem to flow, and it's archival footage was often irrelevant, showing things that were totally contrary or unrelated to the dialog. Like I said, it was an interesting subject, but not a good job of putting it together.",1484870400,,796,4.612676056338028

Exceedingly well directed, this story has a real-world arc that even a well-trained writer would find difficult to exceed. Just tops!  Note: although Walter Cronkite is listed as the film's ""star"" (and does his usual credible job as color man), in fact it is the actor Hal Holbrook, known for his cinematic ability and distinctive voice who handles the narration throughout the two-hour presentation, almost as memorable as his memorable solo portrayals of Mark Twain.",1483056000,,560,5.222222222222222

some of the little bits and pieces here and there of everything all together, you can't help but agree with those who have said that they were the greatest generation. Some of the atrocities dealt with, the horrors of war, the personal hell experienced by lots of people have filled me with a
new found respect for what they did. It's too bad that all those memories and personal experiences can't be chronicled for those of us interested
in such things to see so we can at least try to relate to what they did for our country.",1476489600,6,675,4.322834645669292

There is usually more information about gliders being used in the European Theater, and not a lot of people know that they were also used in the war against Japan.  I was a little disappointed that the DVD didn't cover more about them being used in the Pacific, but it does tell a good story about their history, and how the gliders played an important part in helping to win WWII.  It did take a lot of guts to pilot one of these things knowing that you had just one chance to make a decent landing.

Disposable craft and mighty pilots.  Were they braver than brave?  The most dedicated (all volunteers) in the nation?  Or crazy?

200599,4,1592180418,"This is a great film that helps to fill the void in military history concerning the development and deployment of gliders during WWII.  What is particularly interesting is the origins of the use of gliders by German forces at the beginning of the war and their role in the rapid movement of German forces through Belgium and France.  Most of us probably know of the use of gliders in the Normandy invasion, but there is much more to learn in this film on the development of the U.S. glider program, and the film does a good job of informing us of glider development and use by our military forces.  Hats off to the brave pioneers and pilots of the glider corps!",1462579200,3,661,4.446280991735537

They were with out a doubt the bravest of the brave and did not receive, in my opinion, the respect or honor that they deserved.  If any of the readers of this review are WWII glider pilots, Gentlemen-I salute you.  I wish you the best, you truly deserve it!

One thing, I would have liked in the film was more information as to how these guys were able to get themselves back to the launching area to fly their additional missions.  As I understood the movie, some flew as many as three trips across the channel and on their own worked their way back to England to fly another mission into the battle areas.",1454976000,2,726,4.231884057971015

200623,5,1592180418,Gliders in WWII - what a story overlooked. Glad to learn of this part of military service.

200624,3,1592180418,"This one blew a great chance to enlighten, resorting instead to warmed-over history and anecdotes.  NOWHERE is this film is there an explanation of the strategic purpose of gliders.  Much of the film tells of the war not having anything to do with gliders.  It's just padding.  At the beginning there's the old stem-winding chestnut that the Pearl Harbor attack was ""unprovoked"".  Anyone who's read any history of what got America into the war knows that Japan was provoked repeatedly by America, over a war in China which America had only emotional interest in, culminating in an American embargo imposed on Japan of strategic materials.  America deliberately goaded Japan into firing the first shot.  Then, we have an interview with a veteran who told how he signed up for gliders because he wanted to fly but didn't have a college degree.  That is how gliders came into the picture.  No explanation of why they were needed.  Afraid this documentary is a mediocrity.",1451174400,,968,4.919753086419753

But I had not known very much of the details, and certainly not how the pilots were trained and how the gliders were built and used.

This is a very good overview of their story; gliders were critical in a number of campaigns in WWII, especially for the Allies, and this documentary covers their story very well.

Not much has ever been mentioned about the glider corp except perhaps in passing and the tremendous loss of life and material in some of the operations.  This gave it some balance and is a great catch up on the history behind the efforts of a brave bunch of combat flyers.  A must see for anyone wanting the deeper history of this era and effort.,1388534400,,482,4.393258426966292
200683,5,1592180418,These pilots accepted the danger of flying single use gliders into the war zone.  It would be interesting to see a companion movie on how the Germans developed their military gliders.,1387065600,,183,4.903225806451613
200684,5,1592180418,A story that needed telling and they told it extremely well.  The fact that Walter Cronkite actually traveled with them on several of their flights adds a definitive touch and dramatic flare to the production as a whole.,1386374400,,220,4.7894736842105265
200685,4,1592180418,A part of WWII that most people don't know about. These gilder pilots were real heros. I can proudly say my Dad was one of these brave men.,1382659200,,139,4.0
200686,5,1592180418,"For those who do not know and for those who do, this is a 'must view.' Exceptionally well presented with interviews and original footage. Look into the eyes of these men and try to fathom what they accomplished and at what cost. Follow their path from the inception of the concept through many of the most significant battles of WWII. The glider pilots were all volunteers and one can only view them with awe. Recommended for anyone with an interest in military history and aviation. Recommended for those who want to further their knowledge and understanding of another era.

200688,4,1592180418,Having first hand stories of the experiences makes history much more alive.  Knowing that people faced these challenges and were able to overcome them amazes me.  Then to read that they did it not for the glory but just because it needed to be done humbles me.

200693,4,1592180418,"Interesting film that brings to light the contributions of glider pilots in WII. The fighter and bomber crews got all the press, but these unsung pilots delivered the men to the battlefield then joined the fight beside their passengers.",1368489600,,236,5.076923076923077
200694,3,1592180418,"This is a wonderful tribute to the glider pilots of WWII. However it virtually ignores the role of the glider infantry who did most of the fighting. Toward the end of the video it even goes so far as to say that the glider pilots beat the Germans and ""captured over 75 German soldiers."" The pilots were 4 men amongst over 40 glider infantry in that action. To say the pilots achieved these great feats is an inaccuracy and a disservice to the noble glider infantry who served.",1368144000,,476,4.420454545454546

200696,5,1592180418,"I had heard about the use of gliders in the invasion on D day, but had no idea how extensive these operaions were, nor of the absolute bravery of the men who flew them. To fly a defenseless glider into battle, survive the crash landing, join up with the infantry and fight your way back to the rear where you got set up to do it all again takes courage that is exceptional. The narrative by Uncle Walter of the CBS News team is an added plus.",1367712000,3,442,4.091954022988506

200699,4,1592180418,This documentary delivers a somewhat negative perspective related to military glider technology during WW II.  The experiences of survivors and observers repeatedly casts a shadow of sacrifice over valor.,1359244800,,204,6.0344827586206895
200700,5,1592180418,"I'd had no idea of how much the glider pilots had contributed to the war - this DVD was very educational.  It included some history about the glider program, early problems, and training.
I liked the interviews with various surviving glider pilots, Walter Cronkite, and Andy Rooney.
About the DVD itself:
Presented in the 16 X 9 format (with subtitles!).  Almost two hours long.
Quality of the source material was sometimes limited to old 16mm film, but that was expected.
Bottom line: Highly Recommended!",1320796800,4,505,5.0
200701,4,1592180418,"WWII was the only war in which gliders were used in combat on a large scale. For a variety of reasons (mostly the practicality of helicopters) these aircraft are no longer needed but for a time they represented one of the best ways for delivering troops behind enemy lines and the ONLY way to deliver light artillery and other ""heavy"" equipment needed by airborne troops.

This documentary inlcudes archival footage not just of US operations but also German operations which shaped American interest in the glider as a weapon. There are also interviews with glider pilots who served during many of the campaigns in Europe and elsewhere. A great film and well-worth watching.",1313884800,5,674,4.964601769911504

200704,5,1592180418,"In the annals of World War II history one finds a plethora of information about the soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought the war.  It's usually about the infantry and the paratroopers, about the tank battles, the air battles, the sea battles and the war on the home front and how they all combined their efforts to win the war.  But how much do we hear about another aspect of air warfare, the gliders and the men who flew them to deliver the heavy goods to the troops who parachuted behind the lines?

This film explains the history of the glider corps, the concept of aerial delivery in use before the present day airdrop of heavy equipment in a combat zone was perfected in the post-WWII era.  It covers the selection of glider pilots, men who wanted to be Air Corps pilots but, for various reasons, were unable to qualify for powered aircraft ratings, the design of WWII gliders, both Allied and Axis, and a brief history of every major glider operation during the war beginning with the German assaults in Belgium in 1940 and Crete in 1941, the US/British actions in Burma, Normandy, Southern France and Holland, and the Rhine Crossings in 1945.

Interviews with former glider pilots throughout the film add a personal touch to this great story of a group of men who entered a combat zone as professional airmen but who quickly became infantrymen once they delivered their goods.  Trained to cut loose from their tow aircraft and land in the middle of a combat zone 30 seconds later with their cargoes of humans and heavy equipment, they were not only responsible for delivering their cargo safely but were expected to fight along side their fellow troopers until they were no longer needed in the combat zone and could be evacuated back to their bases in time for their next drop.  As the glider pilots themselves are won't to say, ""The ""G"" on our wings didn't stand for ""Gliders"", it stood for ""Guts!""

This documentary is as entertaining as it is informative, and it is a must for any serious WWII historian, aviation or otherwise.",1271203200,3,2042,4.6685236768802225
