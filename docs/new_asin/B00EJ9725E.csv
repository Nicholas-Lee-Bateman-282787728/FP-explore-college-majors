5921122,5,B00EJ9725E,"This movie was a fun travelogue on the big curved screen in the 1950's.  Now on a digitalized Blu-Ray format with the SMILEBOX Widescreen provides us with the illusion of the original curved 3 projector experience.  A must have for the admirers of Cinerama.  A must have.  Many extras and fun, fun, fun.",1388016000,8,303,4.660377358490566
5921123,5,B00EJ9725E,"Another Cinerama travelogue now released in a beautiful Blu-Ray SmileBox format. The scenery is positively spectacular with Orson Welles narrating. It is a big plus that these original Cinerama movies are being released in SmileBox simulating the original Cinerama process. MGM released ""How the West Was Won' in SmileBox and I just wish that all Cinerama movies were released in the SmileBox process. This is the original roadshow presentation.",1386288000,16,445,5.463768115942029
5921124,5,B00EJ9725E,"Image Trends performs miracles on this round of Cinerama restorations!  Due to the extra cost & complexity of restoration many people felt these films would never be restored. Image Trends goes above & beyond! Cinerama was an industry game changer. In 1952 they had developed wide aspect ratio & high resolution picture along with 7 channel high fidelity simultaneous surround sound. A very significant step(s) up from the norm of the time. Their ""test"" exhibition on Broadway was a colossal success leading to international growth. South Seas is the last of the initial Cinerama travelog films and the subject matter is stunning in sight & sound. The motion of the ocean on the Te Vega really puts you in the picture! It's such a 1950's time capsule. The Tongan Choir singing Handel's messiah in Polynesian is astounding! They did not read music but used a system of numbers. The higher the number the higher the note.  Pick up a Blue-ray deck if you don't have one. They are really affordable these days. Cinerama is high resolution from the start so it's pays off on this vintage material. Recommenced!",1383523200,20,1105,4.872340425531915
5921125,5,B00EJ9725E,"Unseen theatrically since the early 1970s and never before released on home video, CINERAMA SOUTH SEAS ADVENTURE can now be viewed in a digitally remastered edition. The film was restored from its original camera negatives, emitting both a breathtakingly colorful panorama and a sparklingly clear, seven-channel sound track. Narrated by Orson Wells the film takes us on five different stories following trips to Hawaii Tahiti, Tonga and Fiji, then to and the even more exotic, primitive Pentecost Island.  Native dancing and song are celebrated alongside cultures and customs spanning thousands of years. Then it's onward to New Zealand and to Australia. My granddaughters and I watched the Blu-ray today and they really enjoyed the movie.  Watch and you will see primitive bungee jumping from a tower with vines attached to the boys feet...YIKES.  Sound is great and the transfer is even better than ""This is Cinerama"" re-mastered last year.  It's worth every penny. There is a vintage Renault promotional film as originally presented in 3-panel Cinerama that is pretty cool.",1382918400,32,1076,5.311764705882353

5921129,5,B00EJ9725E,"Again these folks have done an excellent job of presenting a classic film process on blu ray. Equal to the presentation of this is cinerama. We now have these classic treasures preserved forever. I look forward to the future release of south seas adventure and seven wonders of the world. Unfortunately I have retired and moved into a smaller home. So now I watch these on a 65"" pannasonic zt as opposed to my past 110"" projection system. Still gives you the concept of what it must have been like to see these as they were meant to be seen. Thanks to the producers for keeping these memories alive.",1405468800,5,599,4.504587155963303
5921130,4,B00EJ9725E,"I was very impressed with the SmieBox restoration of THIS IS CINERAMA, which I first saw in 1952 when I was only five years old, and which changed film projection forever, prompting CinemaScope, and many others.

And I loved the Smilebox restoration of HOW THE WEST WAS WON, one of my great guilty favorites.

While the restorations of WINDJAMMER and CINERAMA HOLIDAY were disappointing for content, but excellent in restoration, I found this to be the most entertaining of the three, followed by WINDJAMMER, and a distant third for HOLIDAY.

Beautiful photography of beautiful islands that are no longer as pristine as photographed here.",1401753600,,638,5.115384615384615
5921131,4,B00EJ9725E,"At long last the Cinerama feature South Seas Adventure has been released to DVD and Blu-Ray, and it is worth the wait. The music, one of the lushest scores Alex North ever created, gives this movie a real lift. But while there is a lot of good about it, there are still several things which are really puzzling to me. Cinerama after all was the iconic wide-screen presentation with three cameras and three projectors covering a huge curved screen to give the audience an illusion of depth never before achieved in cineama. Opening in 1952, Cinerama produced four travelogues with the fifth and final one being SSA. The movie has been billed as a documentary/travelogue but the really puzzling thing about it is, these are almost all actors potraying roles. After this release in 1959, Cinerama went to a full fledged story line with two fetures, The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm and How the West Was Won before losing the 3-camera system to a one-camera system. In fact, the only person who plays herself in any of the stories is the lady who does the Australian school of the air sequence. This blu-ray is especially fun to watch and easy on the eyes. i'm still wating though, for 7 Wonders and the Search for Paradise features to be released, hopefully this year, then have the WWBG sometime in 2015. HTW3 is already in release with a Smilebox look. Smilebox, incidentally, comes as close to projecting the original Cinerama features as possible without actually being in the theater. With a just over two hour running time, it doesn't really need an intermission, and could be shown without it. I await the other three releases with eager anticipation. There was another film released about the same time as SSA but in a slightly different process. Windjammer was released in a process called Cinemiracle, and was presented in Cinerama in several theaters. Still, its nice to see all of these feature films once more. Oh, yes, and they are better than IMAX, even the IMAX director said so.",1400803200,6,2001,4.769452449567724
5921132,5,B00EJ9725E,Cinerama South Seas Adventure is a great video that will make you long for the past. It is filled with amazing video footage of the South Pacific and island life from that time period. The Cinarama aspect is presented well and gives you a taste of this kind of cinematography.,1394064000,6,276,4.54
5921133,5,B00EJ9725E,A must see on a BIG home cinema  wide screen. The many Cinerama web sites on the history of Cinerama are worth viewing.,1393372800,2,119,4.173913043478261
5921134,5,B00EJ9725E,Wonderful to be able to see these Cinerama Travelogue films again on Blu Ray DVD and in the curved screen ratio. The extras are intetesting too especially the restoration of the film.,1389225600,5,183,4.75
5921135,5,B00EJ9725E,Produced from the original negatives the visuals are absolutely stunning and David Strohmeier has done an incredible job of combining the three images into one sweeping spectacular Cinerama experience.,1388448000,6,201,5.9655172413793105

8605983,4,B00EJ9725E,"Although the Cinerama films are now dated, the scenes in the film 'South Sea Adventure' are so well photographed bringing those South Pacific Islands to life in my living room. Very good visuals and sound on the blu-ray version.",1470009600,,228,4.871794871794871
8605984,3,B00EJ9725E,"If it were up to me, the full length of this feature would be devoted to Hawaii because the footage is both spectacular and evocative of a Hawaii that is no longer there.  The whole of the film looks great and the sojourns to Tahiti, etc. are enjoyable...but the section on Australia is interminable.  The ""story"" is contrived and whoever thought making the bulk of a Cinerama feature about a sick kid in the Outback should be beaned with a boomerang.  As it's the largest section and comes towards the end of the film, it leaves you feeling as though you ate some sumptuous exotic appetizers and are now sitting down to an huge plate of Vegemite.  I have rewatched this blu-ray a few times and always skip Australia after the Sydney footage.

That aside, there is some GREAT footage of the Lurline...Don the Beachcomber's...and Waikiki before all the high rises.  The arrival of the Lurline is amazing to see in its composition in an age before CG would have made it a piece of cake.  Don't want to spoil it.  You'll know when you see it.  Visits to other islands are all kind of standard Cinerama fare and they don't overstay their welcome even if the locations pale (literally and figuratively) next to Hawaii.  This is my favorite Cinerama blu-ray out of the 5 that I own because of both the subject matter and the time machine quality that it has in common with its companion titles.  Pricey as usual but cheaper than a plane ticket.",1447632000,7,1438,4.556420233463035
8605985,3,B00EJ9725E,"A real curate's egg,  some parts are impressive while others make you wonder why they were included especially the Outback scenes that outstay their welcome and don't suit the Cinerama ambience.",1440806400,,194,5.258064516129032

8605987,5,B00EJ9725E,"I wish that ""I-Max"" theaters would format these cinerama films and run them once in awhile. They're like time capsules of random places all over the world. Great booklet and extra features.",1426896000,2,189,4.9375
8605988,5,B00EJ9725E,"I for one am glad to see the old Cinerama films released. Sure, they are dated but for those of us who saw them in there full Cinerama release they are a treasure. I just hope they release Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. I have the laser disk but it has a bit of pan and scan. I like the smile box on these DVDs. Makes it more like the theater presentation.",1424131200,,364,4.0
8605989,4,B00EJ9725E,I love the nostalgia of the old Cinerama productions from the early 1950s.  Gotta remember that these shows were before CinemaScope and StereoPhonic sound.,1421020800,,155,5.458333333333333
