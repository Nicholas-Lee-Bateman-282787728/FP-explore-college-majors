8465428,1,B005CFC0SI,"That is pretty much it.  My assumption about movies that would be put into an ""Action Pack"" is different.  All but one of these is dialog, dialog, dialog ....  dialog...  dialog...  swing, punch (an hour in) ... dialog ... ""look out, he's got a gun"" ... bang, you're dead ... dialog ... the end.

Ooooh.  ""Action.""",1387238400,7,314,4.5
