8420463,4,6301357345,"This movie was filmed at the University of Virginia in the mid 1980's.  I was a student at the University at the time and I remember when the movie was being made and when it came out.  I saw it back in the 80's and I seem to remember that my English writing prof was one of the bad guys.  It was an OK movie, but if you have any connection with UVA, it is a rather unique movie to have in your collection.  There are a lot scenes filmed in and around the University.  The title of the movie while it was being filmed was ""Going Nuclear"",  but when it came out, the title was changed to ""Mutants In Paradise"".",1452988800,,609,3.9917355371900825
