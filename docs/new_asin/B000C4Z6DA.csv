8095683,4,B000C4Z6DA,I teach 6th grade science.  One of our units is on chemistry.  My students got a kick out of the songs on here.  In addition to the songs there are some nice video clips explaining chemical phenomenon.  I would recommend this to other teachers trying to teach chemistry to the lower grade levels.,1322956800,,296,4.528301886792453
8095684,5,B000C4Z6DA,"This series is so funny.
I enjoyed it so much, especially the ""things are achanging"" track.
I was doing hoola hoops and throwing my hands up in the air, just like the DJ character.
Never seen science made this kid friendly:-O Perhaps with the exception of the movie ""Osmosis Jones"".
I orderer the whole series of Squibs after watching this first one. Good talent behind this work!",1302825600,,380,4.686567164179104
8095685,5,B000C4Z6DA,"All of the Squibs videos are advanced and they attempt to simplify subjects as much as possible. The animations aren't great, but they are creative and there are some catchy rhymes and songs in each video. When I was a medical student, I bought the Squibs video on the body systems and I absolutely loved it. My son (3 at the time) wouldn't sit down and watch it, but I would play it in the room while he was playing with his toys. Occassionally he would look up at it for a bit and keep on playing. Because of comments he would make to me, I was sure that he was inadvertanly retaining some of what he was hearing on the Squibs video. So I bought more. After I started doing the same thing with the Squibs Chemistry, he told me that, ""when wood burns it's undergoing a chemical reaction."" I now have the entire Squibs set and I am very pleased with everyone of them. They are really fantastic learning tools and give a nice overview of many different subjects. Just don't expect mindless ""educational"" cartoons like Little Einsteins (I was never happy with any of that line) because this is certainly way beyond that.",1233187200,,1118,4.432038834951456
8095686,3,B000C4Z6DA,"Three Stars [C-] :::  This is a lively video that should only be used for reinforcement of material that has already been previously covered.  It talks about state changes, atomic structure, litmus paper, and the period chart, etc., but it does NOT teach children about any of these topics.  There is no systematic approach nor any introduction to the material covered.  The video 'just jumps in there' and the best you could say about the DVD is that it offers children alternative ways to memorize and visualize the material using a cartoon format and songs.

8095687,4,B000C4Z6DA,"If you want your child (and probably yourself!) to be challenged by an educational science video, this is the series to get.  Squibs covers detailed concepts and terminology from a wide range of sciences.  I am reasonably well versed in the sciences, yet I learned new facts right along with the kids.

The Squibs producer don't pull any punches when it comes to providing correct information and terminology.  In fact, unlike many other science videos for kids that I've watched, I have yet to see inaccurate information in any of the Squibs videos.

The only negative aspect I see on these shows are some of the songs themselves.  In an effort to diversify the music and connect with modern music, some of the songs are hard to understand and feel disjointed.  One complaint I have seen is that the videos gloss over too much information to be useful.  One reviewer stated, ""It attempts to cover an entire textbook or two of material in seconds"".  This is a valid concern although I think misguided.  It does indeed cover a large amount of information in a short time, but it is not intended to be used in a vacuum.  Books, games, discussions, and repetition are critical to help your kids understand what has just been presented.  No video alone can teach them all they need to know about science.

Despite being a bit over their heads, my children (age 5 and 8) love these shows and watch them whenever they can.  They enjoy them, but most importantly, they are learning and remembering.

Yes, it's complex; yes, it's challenging; and yes, you may occasionally feel stupid watching it; but if the show doesn't challenge your kids to think and learn, what's the point of watching?",1183420800,,1683,4.715753424657534
8095688,1,B000C4Z6DA,This was hard to follow.  Don't spend your money on the squibs series.,1173398400,,70,4.384615384615385
8095689,1,B000C4Z6DA,"Please do not buy this dismal excuse for an educational video.  It consists of a string of loud (yet mumbled!) songs throwing around a bunch of terminology.  It attemps to cover an entire textbook or two of material in seconds.  There is little or no development of any topic.  Worse, the songs are colossally annoying.  I can't believe I paid almost twenty bucks for this disaster.  My poor children looked like they were shellshocked.  Ugh!",1150156800,12,442,4.8133333333333335
