4098587,5,B0039UU3M8,"Gilda Radner was my favorite Not Ready for Prime Time Player and this DVD of her Broadway event gathers some of her best characters in one place - it's a wonderful way to remember her. Whether you're watching her audition with the hilariously ironic I Love to Be Unhappy or watching her Talk Dirty to the Animals, she's always pitch perfect. And you'll get big laughs from Roseanne Roseannadanna, Emily Litella and Judy Miller. It's hard to live in a world without Gilda, so thank goodness this show was taped!",1350000000,4,510,4.677777777777778
4098588,2,B0039UU3M8,"Gilda Radner is the best. I am so sad she is no longer with us. This was some of her best work and shows why we loved her so much.

The Amaazon ""manufactured on demand"" DVD is another story. I have 4 different commercial DVD players (and 2 player/recorders), none of them could play this disk at all. Additionally, DVD drives on 2 older computers could not either. 2 of the high-end DVD players that could NOT play it are only 6-12 months old!
Only a 1 year old Dell laptop with a DVD player/recorder and a 4 month old Desktop (with a blue-ray DVD player and a DVD player/recorder) could play it.",1318032000,6,596,4.274336283185841
4098589,5,B0039UU3M8,"She may be gone, but she's definitely not forgotten.  I have always loved the talented work of Gilda Radner, and now I can finally enjoy her again.  Endearing, inspiring, and most certainly, FUNNY!... Gilda will always be my favorite comedienne...and if you watch this DVD, she will be yours too.  One of the original cast member's of Saturday Night Live's ""Not ready for prime time players"" Gilda had set the bar pretty high, and has been one tough act to follow.  -Elizabeth M., Staten Island, NY",1317686400,4,498,4.755813953488372
4098590,5,B0039UU3M8,"If you want to understand how seminal and ground-breaking the original SNL cast was, you have to look at the best of the individual players.  They were all funny, but Gilda Radner was hilarious, touching, heart-breaking and brilliant.  There will never be another like her.

The first cast of SNL was also, in many ways, the first generation to have grown up on TV.  Like the kids who grew up with computers, they instinctively understood that TV was its own medium, with its own rules and traditions;  it wasn't a movie screen in your living room any more than a computer is a TV that you type on.

And so, they understood what limits to push and what resonated with the generation they shared a time-space with. Gilda was the most sensitive of the bunch...she knew us: she shared our secrets; she knew our deepest fears and our finest hopes.  If you can listen to ""Honey, Touch Me (with My Clothes On)"" without weeping for a lost time gone by, you're either a cold fish or from a different era.

In this era of anything goes, ""Let's Talk Dirty to the Animals"" is still hilarious and happily shocking.  I could go on, but Gilda's passing represented a loss to our comic heritage that rivals (and even surpasses) that of any comic genius, from Belushi to Bruce.  (I have no idea about the technical quality of Amazon's DVD-R.  The content, however, is beautiful.  You won't find a better way to spend an evening than watching the finest performer from the 70's.)",1301011200,15,1462,4.5807692307692305
4098591,5,B0039UU3M8,"I was beyond thrilled to find this Gilda Radner DVD! What a talent this lady was, and this is classic comedy!",1280793600,6,109,4.238095238095238
4098592,1,B0039UU3M8,"Although I would have loved to have watched this DVD, I was quite upset when I put it in my DVD player and started watching.  In the first five minutes, it started skipping and the picture was scrambled.  It then jumped from chapter to chapter and then froze about twenty-five minutes into it.

On the disc, the words ""DVD Download"" appears.  I don't know if this means that this CD was just burned onto a DVD-R or DVD+R, but it certainly is not working in my DVD player or another fairly new player I also tried to watch it on.

DON'T BUY!!!",1278288000,9,542,4.2745098039215685
4098593,5,B0039UU3M8,"The sellers on amazon are charging double the price if not more for this great film. Go to [...] and get it for 19.99 and they ship it UPS for free!! Its made on demand and may not play on some players esp. the ones with recorders built in but it plays fine on ""play only"" devices. Its in widescreen and the picture looks as bright and clean as it did back when it showed in the theaters in 1980. Still just as funny as it was back then!! Gilda radner was a truly talented woman whose life was cut way short when she died of cancer and her smile and humor live on in this film!!",1263427200,16,578,3.948717948717949

4098625,5,B0039UU3M8,I taped this when it was on SNL. Then I bought the VHS when it came out. Now I got the DVD so I can keep having keepsakes of the laughs of all the skits. Definitely a monument to her memory and her wild and witty humor. Gets you up when you are down.,1400544000,5,250,3.6481481481481484

4098631,4,B0039UU3M8,"First of all, Gilda Radner was one of the great comedians of her generation, and this performance is among her best.  She's supported by an awesome cast including Paul Schaffer (who later lad the band for David Letterman) and Don Novello's fantastic Father Guido Sarducci.  The show itself is brilliant and incredibly funny.
The DVD I received was produced on demand by Amazon, so it's on DVD-R media.  Given that, the disc itself pretty good quality.  The disc is printed with actual artwork instead of the paper label I was expecting.
I only take a star off my rating for the production of the DVD.  There is only a generic menu, saying ""play program"" with no mention of title or content, no menu art of any kind.  The program itself is 16x9 widescreen, full DVD quality.  Apart from that, the whole thing feels like it was dashed together without any thought.
So thank you, WB, for releasing this awesome performance, but next time put a little effort into it.

PS: The fact that this program from 1979 is in widescreen indicates it was shot on film.  Hey, WB, how about a blu-ray release?",1365033600,2,1092,4.616580310880829
4098632,5,B0039UU3M8,"I recently thought of this movie when they had a show on TV about the first 5 years of SNL, and was so pleased to find it on DVD.  I had run through a number of copies on VHS, as I can watch this movie over and over again.  That Don Novello as Father Quido Sarducci is in this movie is icing on the cake!",1363824000,,304,3.6615384615384614
4098633,5,B0039UU3M8,This was a show I had seen on cable in the early 80's  and had a difficult time in finding on DVD and at a reasonable price. I very much Thank Amazon.com for having the connections and ability to purchase.,1359504000,,205,4.125

And others and cracking everybody up.  I think she was the funniest woman of all time.  And just as good as any man.  There  is also Father Guido Sarducci who comes along a couple of times.  It seems mostly to give Gilda a break. It doesn't matter how many times I see this.  It always kills me.",1491696000,,462,4.469879518072289
