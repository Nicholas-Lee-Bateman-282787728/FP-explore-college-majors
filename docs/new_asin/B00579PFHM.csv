8460426,3,B00579PFHM,"Just another day at work under the cameras.

This LEAVE IT TO BEAVER backlot paranoia piece from '62 perfectly captures typical U.S. corporate lassiez faire working conditions in the new millennia, where little Big Brother stares over your shoulder, listens to your phone calls, monitors your correspondence, checks mandatory periodic drug screens, requires your private passwords, and runs invasive background checks on your always very public past.  Same corporate management style, same work speedup, same unpaid overtime, same increased ""goals"" (replacing ""quotas""), same mandatory voluntary social obligations, same survelliance, same implied threats with verbal praise, and the main character is just as clueless as most I've witnessed being fired for Christmas these last two decades, with his ears and eyes shut, mouth wide open, at the worst possible times.  (Unused vacation blackout dates are not mentioned.)

C'est la vie.

And a WW2 small town America fun propaganda movie about normal local politics.",1475539200,,1014,5.644736842105263
8460427,5,B00579PFHM,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable throw-back to the days when communist Russia was our greatest fear, before the days when we traded so freely with Red China. A man wakes up one day to find his family and town turned commie. In a way it's a metaphor for what has been slowly happening in our country as we let our personal freedoms seem to be slowly stripped from us. Perhaps if we still had some of these anticommmunist beliefs in this country, we would learn to by American or at least goods made in a democratic nation. Also on this dvd is a movie with Frank Morgan who played the Wizard of Oz. He plays a judge vacationing in a crooked town. Anyway, both are old school entertainment.",1337817600,5,685,4.359375
8460428,5,B00579PFHM,"This movie is a lot like an episode of the Twilight Zone, only instead of Rod Serling, Jack Webb is the narrator. A typical suburban man finds out what it's like when his family and town turn communist overnight. Soon he is put on trial for being against the government. It's pure cold war paranoia. The bonus film, A Stranger In Town"" is a pleasant surprise as it stars Frank Morgan (The Wizard of Oz) as a kindly judge who runs into problems in a small town during his fishing trip.",1308787200,6,484,4.329670329670329
