3702821,4,B001MYIXBQ,I saw Shuttle after it was recommended by a local film critic in Boston.  It really deserved a better distribution than a few token cities.  It does everything a good thriller should; it has characters in peril you are invested in with strong performances that deliver the plot twists. The ending left me with a sense of dread/horror.,1238630400,34,334,4.741379310344827
3702822,5,B001MYIXBQ,"Most of the reviews I have seen for this movie are very positive (which I think it deserves). The only downfall to this film is that there are a few parts where you have to suspend disbelief just a bit (ever seen a horror movie where you didn't?) But I'm a glass is half full kind of person. And this movie is a stroke of pure genious in the things in gets right. It starts off like it is just going to may be scare you a little bit and not hurt you too bad - and then it totally kicks your butt and keeps on kicking you after you are down. I love this flick, and I think most people who watch it will feel the same.",1238544000,53,616,3.8203125

3702824,3,B001MYIXBQ,"Spoiler alert

SPOILER ALERT I really liked this movie.  The story was clever and had lots of plot twists, some that I saw coming and some I didn't.  But here comes the spoiler; I only gave it three stars because I got SO tired of failure after failure after failure of these completely inept characters.  Both captives and captors were so stupid and so utterly foolish that by the end (which I loved) I was cheering for the bad guy, even though he was as worthless as his captives.  It stretched credibility that he could still be as active as he was after what he went through...... Jason Voorhees he ain't.  The old running down the middle of the road from a vehicle, really?!?  C'mon man!  And how many seat belts did they have in that van?  They were getting cut through in massive numbers yet still appeared to be plentiful.  And there was the obligatory trip and fall over absolutely nothing.... please.  Despite all the time I spent rolling my eyes and yelling at the idiotic characters, I still liked it a lot.",1511481600,3,1019,4.483695652173913
3702825,3,B001MYIXBQ,"This was a decent movie. Lots of twists and enough suspense to keep me watching. There were a couple of times during the movie I found myself checking to see how much longer until the end. I think that was because there are parts of the movie that seem to drag. However, I did like the fact that I really had no clue how things would end. Kept me guessing, and for that I enjoyed it and would recommend this movie to others. The beginning seemed somewhat pointless to the movie itself. I got the feeling that was the time I was supposed to be bonding with the main characters, yet that did not happen. I think it would have been better if the movie just started at the time of baggage claim. Everything we needed to know about them, we could have learned while they were on the Shuttle. Anyway, I do not get paid the big bucks, so what do I know. Worth checking out.",1509667200,2,866,4.191616766467066

3702849,2,B001MYIXBQ,"They were obviously going for a gritty realistic thriller movie--not some can't kill him slasher flick and for that reason alone, the plot crashed and burned.  Unrealistic setting and plot holes that they never tie up or explain.  For example, the supermarket call 911 note thing.  The clerk is on the phone with 911 and yet for the rest of the movie you see not a single cop (and literally like 2 cars on the road for that matter) the entire movie.  huh?  Seriously, I was on board until the supermarket--when, after a disheveled girl hands the clerk a note telling her she needs help and check the video..the clerk (the ONLY damn person working in the entire supermarket I guess) doesnt even GLANCE outside to see where the girl went?  Cause, she would have probably seen the guy get run over (twice) in the parking lot (which, not to be redundant but has the entire city been evacuated or something?!).  I dug the acting and thought the story had a really good dark tense feel but anyone who thought this was great cause it was realistic or gritty or whatever......wha?",1453507200,3,1072,4.5811518324607325

3702882,3,B001MYIXBQ,"Interesting take on a worldwide topic - Slave Trade among young people.  I'm not sure I would call this a horror story as much as a Almost Real Life Drama.  When something hits close to reality, the horror is that it exists.  Maybe this was played up a bit more than necessary, but like one person commented...it may be a bigger problem than most of us are aware of.

Couple things seem a bit Overly  dramatized...Like the wimpy Crackpot.  Or the ending where the cargo is being sent to Asia?  You mean they don't have enough women over there?...that they want white ladies???  It's bad enough families in Asia sell their children for this sort of thing...sad sad sad

  And shipping containers - don't go through inspection?  I used to work for a shipping company...so?  Who has their hands in WHO's Pockets?

sigh...I guess the message is that this sort of thing may or does happen.  Young women may need to know that partying is not all THAT, and you should be aware of your surroundings and so on...when travelling alone, without chaperones or someone being accountable to your whereabouts.

3702883,2,B001MYIXBQ,"This movie could have been a very good thriller, the premise is good and the cast, while not known stars, all did an excellent job with their parts. The main problem I have, SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT is the number of times the victims had the chance to either kill their captors and didn't take it, how everything seemed to work out for the captors, and the inhuman amount of bodily harm the one kidnapper sustained and was still able to ""get the job done"". Rasputin has nothing on this guy.

The characters seem intelligent and resourceful, yet at the same time dim-witted and indecisive. I never talk at movies, either at home or in the theater, (drives me nuts when people do), but I found myself all too often muttering things like ""what major American city has no cell service in a large area?"" ""pick it up"" ""stab him again and again"" ""step on his throat"" ""make sure he's dead"" ""keep running"" ""keep going"", and by far the most frequent ""oh come on!"". The potential was there, but unless you're looking for something to play in the background and pass some time, you'll want to look elsewhere, as this movie will frustrate you to no end.",1423267200,4,1143,4.521739130434782

It was up to speed at first, but then slowed down and lost more and more stars as it went along.  Okay, it's a thriller and a suspense movie. I get it, it doesn't have to be totally in-line with today.  But I feel like this movie tried to be realistic in some sense and failed very hard at it.  It went waayyy beyond reality, to the point of someone getting shot in the face almost point-blank with a handgun and somehow living and thinking consciously about it a minute afterwards, or someone worrying about killing a clear, evident murderer when it's her life on the line, because of something as stupid as a murder charge (duh? self-defense?).  There's a reason 99.9% of movies end with some sort of sense of relief...and that's because, well, we like to feel some satisfaction after we've watched a movie!  Shuttle offers none of that.

Pick a plot and develop it and some dialogue!

End results of all this violent unnecessary torture is no where in forethought- so far out, in fact you sit and wonder- as it appears to be simply a vomitous mess of pieces of plot lines that the writers/ directors had no clue what they were doing, how to move from pot to plot change in the movie, as well as how to end it.

3702941,5,B001MYIXBQ,"Shuttle may not be the most original horror thriller in the world, but writer/director Edward Anderson takes the film to places some directors would never go, and it is that unflinching brutality and darkness that really sets this film apart.  The terror builds slowly at first, but it never lets up once it's started; in fact, the emotional storm reconstitutes and re-strengthens itself on several occasions.  Yes, there are moments when you would plead with the characters to make a move and do something, but this film nevertheless defies the stereotypes of the genre, presenting us with leading characters who display the kind of guts and initiative that female victims are all too lacking in most cinematic cases.  Both of the lead actresses are just marvelous, and their performances are what make this thriller so intense and memorable.

The dangerous part of a Mexican vacation is supposed to be getting out of Mexico without being kidnapped or killed by some thug, probably using a gun supplied to the Mexican underworld by our own questionable Department of Justice.  For Mel (Peyton List) and Jules (the uber-gorgeous Cameron Goodman), though, danger finds them right after they've landed safely back in the States, when they take the last shuttle out from the airport that dark and rainy night.  They are accompanied by a mousy, middle-aged accountant and two young men who give up their own ride just because one of them is intent on making time with one of these lovely ladies.  It eventually becomes clear that the driver (Tony Curran) is not taking them downtown at all, as he drives into less and less populated areas before making his plans all too evident.  It's not clear where he's taking them, but it is some place decidedly not good.  Mel seems to be the only one determined to fight back, but even she could not foresee the series of surprises and misfortunes that will befall everyone on board before the night is through.  Well, the one major surprise isn't really all that surprising, but the bad guy - not to mention the director - has absolutely no pity when it comes to seeing his plans through.

As you might expect, our abduction victims fail to seize several opportunities early on to get themselves out of their predicament.  I'm an admittedly cowardly sort of fellow, but there were moments when I would have risen up and made my move - so that is frustrating, especially since we're talking about such beautiful young women being in danger.  Still, Mel more than proves herself as the night drags on and the terror grows ever more intense.

Shuttle may not be for everyone, but I consider it one of the better thrillers I've seen in recent years.  For one thing, this is the sort of thing that could actually happen to anyone.  This isn't a bunch of frat boys and coeds going out into the woods to drink and fool around, only to run into a bunch of inbred cannibals; it's two girls simply trying to get home from the airport.  Then you have the fact that these are very sympathetic victims.  Not only are these girls beautiful, they are best friends with some underlying issues of their own - and they don't simply sit back and accept their fates without fighting back.  Stepping back from the characters themselves, what you'll find is a tight script and focused direction that gets the most out of every scene before plunging into the next one, rarely giving the viewer time to remember that this is just a movie.  It's a shame this film hasn't garnered more attention because, from start to finish, Shuttle is a true thriller in every sense of the word.",1333929600,2,3592,4.725961538461538
3702942,2,B001MYIXBQ,"Reading everyone else's reviews, I feel like I am the ONLY person who felt like this movie was really cheesy for the most part.  I actually couldn't even sit through the whole movie...kept skipping parts because I just couldn't stick through the lameness of it.  The shuttle driver was one of the worst.  The characters were so cliche, and I found myself disliking all of them because they were so cheesy.  You could tell right from the beginning who was in on it. I especially thought the shuttle riders were extremely dense, as you could see right from the beginning that the driver was going AWAY from downtown (as you see the downtown lights fading in the background in several shots).  And there were so many times I was thinking, now why didn't you just punch him in the throat and throw him off the shuttle?! If you want to see a movie of real quality about the heart-breaking truths of the sex-slave industry, then watch ""Trade.""  Now THAT is a good movie.

I do have to say that at the end I was finally relieved to see that it wasn't just some stupid mugging movie and that there was some substance to it (her in the box, you realizing why), although at the finale you leave with a sickening feeling, knowing that this kind of thing happens.",1331942400,2,1251,4.4605263157894735

At times the kidnapper seemed to have some remorse for what he was doing to these people...then once we saw then end...we were like ""humm maybe not"".  We think the actors did well, tension was present throughout the movie, and pacing was smooth. It was also a bit different that the main female thought about her actions.  She used some of her job skills to alert the police; yet, she also followed the kidnappers orders and didn't speak to anyone.

3702945,2,B001MYIXBQ,"I have to say I'm surprised many of the user reviews of this movie are as positive as they are. For my dollar this didn't even reach a level of mediocre competence. And I'm not talking about just all the stupid stuff in the script either. This is plain lousy all the way around.

Here's the scoop. Two girlfriends are on their way back from a vacation. They must have grabbed the red eye flight because the airport is nearly deserted when they arrive. They get a cut rate offer from a shuttle driver which they end up sharing with three other guys. Not long into the ride all realize this is not a normal shuttle and they're all fearing for their lives.

One reviewer mentioned you need to suspend your disbelief on a few of the plot points. No. You need to suspend it on nearly all the plot points. This whole thing was unbelievably stupid. Most, if not all this was shot in and around Chicago. I don't care what day it is. Where in Chicago it is. Or what time of the day or night it is. There will always be some traffic. You will not see streets deserted for any length of time as they are in this movie. And when does a kidnapper allow his prey out of a vehicle to shop for stuff he will need to complete his task? Shouldn't he have done that before he even picked them up? Stupid stuff like this happens throughout the movie. There was also a point that telegraphed itself early on but it took them way too long to reveal it. And the directing is incompetent. He could not get through certain parts of scenes well enough to let the viewer know what was happening.

What WAS happening here was that the set up did make me want to know how it would turn out. That was the only reason I stuck with this turkey, and the end was a real downer. It had a point in it so odd I wondered why it was in there. Don't bother with this.

3702947,4,B001MYIXBQ,"Once you climb aboard, Shuttle (2008) takes you on a dark, bleak, and inexorable ride that stretches the bounds of reality, and tests the limits of your endurance for failure.  While perhaps heavy-handed, this tense urban thriller at least offers a change of pace, as it does not take the very well-travelled conventional route.  Some spoilers follow so proceed as you will.

Best friends Melanie (Peyton List) and Jules (Cameron Goodman) have just landed at an airport, after vacationing in Mexico.  Waiting for their luggage, Jules is begins a conversation with fellow traveler Seth (James Snyder).  Mel's bag fails to arrive, and after filing a report, the baggage claim area is empty, when the women finally leave.  Late at night, looking for transportation into town, they decide to take a small shuttle, when the driver (Tony Curren) offers them a discounted fare.  Hoping that something might develop, Seth and his buddy Matt (Dave Powers), also jump on the shuttle, joining the girls and Andy (Cullen Douglas) another passenger.

After driving around and seeing practically no one else on the road, the shuttle has a near crash with another vehicle, and develops a flat.  While changing the tire, there is an accident and Matt loses some of his fingers.  While supposedly on their way to the hospital, the driver pulls a gun and orders everyone to the back of the bus.  The rest of the night is spent on a tense and seemingly endless journey, as the group is put through a terrifying ordeal.

Much happens on this nightmarish ride, but very little of it makes much sense.  With the streets nearly empty, it takes forever to get to the final destination.  There are some eventful stops along the way, one is at a convenience store, where Mel is given 10 minutes to buy the items on a list provided by the driver, in order to prevent him from killing the other passengers.  While the quick thinking Mel completes her task, an attempted escape by the others turns disastrous.  Along the way the group comes up with workable plans, but they almost always result in failure.  There is a good reason for some of the lack of success, as the group is not united in their desire to escape.

A series of violent incidents result in Jules and Mel being the last two passengers.  After a horrific crash, Jules is wandering dazed on the road, and finally finds someone willing to help, only to have her hope crushed before her eyes.  A shell-shocked Jules is recaptured by the driver, and the ladies finally arrive at what seems to be the end of the line.  Mel has one more opportunity to escape, but her bad luck continues, and she finds herself looking at a less than rosy future.  As a parting shot to rub it in one last time, there is a final reminder that if only Mel's luggage had not been misplaced, the loss of many lives might have been avoided.

Shuttle's downbeat ending is unusual, and leaves you feeling empty.  Whatever message the film may have, is delivered in a sensational and self-serving way.  Writer/director Edward Anderson seems intent on having the victims get close to success, and then jerking the rug from under them so they fall very hard.  He hammers the point home repeatedly, as the prisoners have opportunities, but just never seem to get lucky, or do the right thing.  Jules is simply bad news when it comes to anything related to fire, while Mel's inspired idea of leaving a message via security camera fails to pay off.  Seth is just a bad decision maker, while Matt and Andy are totally caught off guard.

It is not specified where this story takes place, but it appears to be a large city in southern California, perhaps Los Angeles.  Wherever it is, it looks like a ghost town.  Even in the middle of the night, there should be other vehicles on the roads, yet the shuttle encounters very few.  In a city with millions, ridiculously there are no people.  The situations may not be realistic, but the strong acting performances help to sell the story, with Peyton List, Cameron Goodman, and Cullen Douglas leading the way.  Tony Curran is effectively menacing underplaying his role, although the driver's near indestructibility, gets to be hard to swallow by the end.  With all its faults, Shuttle is still a suspenseful and engaging thriller, although with most everything going against the victims, it can be a frustrating watch at times.  If things ending badly are upsetting, you may want to pass on this film.",1315612800,,4446,4.721141374837873

3702952,4,B001MYIXBQ,"I love watching obscure/independent horror flicks.  This one was pretty darn good. At first, and throughout probably the first half, the plot may seem kinda boring, and already done 863 times.  Even at this point, I was still enjoying the movie.  The mood set within the shuttle itself is extremely tense, and I think I think the 2 main actors (the driver + the brunette) do a great job.

Warning : SPOILERS BELOW!!!

I was able to recognize fairly early that the Andy dude was in on it.  Seemed kinda obvious, he was just ""too easy"" of a target.  But even after I realized my suspicions were true, I was still glued to the screen.  Movie really drew me in.  i had suspected from early on that the girls were destined to sex slaves, or something along those lines.  The cover of them in the bright lights gave it away, and then that specific part of the flick susstaintiates it.  I liked the ending, but it was a disturbing ending (a la Eden Lake - another great flick).  She's in a box, on a massive export boat on her way to East Asia.  I felt bummed, and kinda ""dirty"" after the movie.

The movie becomes very interesting, I mean, how many movies off the top of your head deal w/ sex slavery? Not many, though there are some.  What's even more bothersome about this, is the plot in this movie, actually happens in some form very often.  People are picked up or kidnapped, and sold into sex slavery.  Only thing I didn't like was that the director tried to be ""different"" than the norm, in that you are lead to hate the antagonist (The Driver) at the beginning, but then as the movie goes on, a picture is painted of a sad man, who may even feel bad for what he is doing.  And during the last few minutes, when it is discovered that the items she was forced to buy from the store are ""survival' items for her inprisonment in the frieght box, I kinda said to myself, ""Oh come on, make up your mind, Dude!""  Overall a great flick.  Intense, very dark and disturbing, I highly recommend it!!",1294012800,3,1990,4.327027027027027

3702955,2,B001MYIXBQ,"The last movie that I watched on my queue was a 2008 movie called Shuttle.  It is about a group of teenagers who arrive at an airport late at night back from a wild trip to Mexico.  They are greeted by a friendly shuttle driver saying he'd gladly take them back to the city for a cheap rate since its his last ride of the night.  He seemed nice enough and they were desperate so they accepted the ride and started their long journey into the night.  Of course, they didn't know at the time that the driver had a different agenda for the group and they are forced to play by his rules the rest of the movie.

Semi-Spoiler poster for Shuttle.
The beginning of this movie has painfully cheesy dialogue between the teens.  One guy must hit on every girl he sees, and his friend is the token nice guy always waiting for the 'right girl.'  The two girls involved are both attractive and one is kinda slutty, so the boys decided to ride with them on the shuttle in hopes of getting some action later.  Needless to say, that decision would cost them dearly.

Naturally, at the first sign of trouble, their cell phones can't get service.  How many times has your phone lost service while you were in a big city just outside of an airport?  The answer should be never, but in the movies, the answer is always.  Anyways, the sinister driver is played very well by Tony Curran (Underworld 2) as he uses his best 'Jigsaw' voice.  Between the driver and the lead females (Peyton List) performance, it made up for the others' lack of talent.  However, the amateur scriptwriting is most likely to blame for their performances.

As for the movie itself, it contained two major twists.  One of which I saw from the second they stepped on the shuttle, which deeply disappointed me.  The other comes at the very end, which I can honestly say I didn't quite see coming.  There were definitely clues throughout that I noticed but it was never blatantly obvious, which was nice.  I'm a firm believer that if you can wow the audience at the end, it can make up for some of the previous shortcomings in the film (i.e. Saw).  The suspense leading up to the final scene was also very well done.  To say I was anxiously on the edge of my seat is an overstatement for sure, but I was definitely interested in the outcome.

This movie definitely chose the suspense over violence route, which is understandable.  Unfortunately, the little violence that is actually shown on screen (which is not much), is poorly done.  Remember being a kid and pretending a to have knife stuck in you?  All you have to do is just stick it to the side of you and it looks real from a side angle.  Well the filmmakers remembered that trick and used it not only once... but THREE times.  I can excuse it once, but every time someone gets stabbed, please make it seem a little more believable.  Little things like that add up and it just ruins the movie for me.

If it wasn't for the strong ending, I would tell you to never watch this movie.  The first two acts of the film are simply not any good.  The violence was poorly executed, the characters were mind-numbingly stupid throughout, and the dialogue was very suspect.  However, Tony Curran played a great bad guy, and I expect to see the beautiful Peyton List in more movies in the future.  Overall, it was a pretty decent first movie from writer/director Edward Anderson, and I'd be interested in seeing what he does next.  Hopefully he learns from his mistakes with Shuttle, and continues to build on the level of suspense provided from the third act of the movie.

Amazingly well made film for a writer/director's debut film. I don't understand why the film got almost unanimously and terribly panned by critics except that the ending of this film must have pissed off allot of people.

I read a number of reviews from top critics who used descriptive words such as remorseless, utter hopelessness, despair, vile, tasteless. These critics neglected that fact that Shuttle is a debut film for it's director and as first film its extremely well done. Compare the quality and subject matter of Shuttle to debut films of some other directors...say... Francis Coppola - Dementia 13- egad, or James Cameron - Piranha II for god's sake! Shuttle wipes these other directors first films off the map.

I do agree with allot of folks who seemed to find a flaw in the film. - That if you think too much about the decisions of the characters, (in particular, the shuttle driver) there is some plot directions that don't gel.  So just don't think about it.

Otherwise Shuttle delivers for what it is - a taut, very dark, sometimes gruesome, action, suspenseful cats and mice thriller.  It has lots of atmosphere, very good photography, an appropriate soundtrack and some really excellent performances - especially the shuttle driver and the two lead actresses. The only character who I had some problem with was the very wimpy accountant. A bit too much of a stereotype for me. Maybe not the actors fault.

I liked the way the director and editors gave the film an interesting rhythm.  The film has stretches of an almost quiet, dark, foreboding, nervous atmosphere that is occasionally peppered with sudden jolts of very quick violence - over as quickly as it starts. Then back to the dark, quiet, nervous atmosphere again.  This effect gives the film an unsettling off tempo feel where anything might happen at any moment.

Another achievement is that most of the film takes place within the confined space of a small shuttle bus with very large windows.  The effect is very good as the audience is constantly aware of the bleak landscapes of old oil refineries and the deserted industrial areas surrounding the passengers.  The color scheme outside the bus seem to be a rich mixture of black and blue shadows and very distant dim lights.

Anderson showed a superior knack with the use of violence in the film and kept the film out of exploitative gore territory.  You feel you are seeing allot of violence but in reality Anderson keeps most of it in your imagination. He uses no gore close ups, or slow-mo nor does he linger on acts of violence (except for one nerve racking asphyxiation) as what is so common these days.  The worst bits of violence take place off screen or at far distances or are over so fast that you hardly see it happen.  His other trick is to just show only the after effects such as some severed fingers in the road or a bandage covering a burn.  It's a case where what you don't see is always more disturbing and frightful then what you do see.

So other then one odd performance and the already mentioned plot holes - Shuttle is a very good suspenseful, edge of your seat film that has lots of twists and turns. Except for one major problem - the ending.

The ending is why I can't recommend the film to most folks or give the film heaps of stars.

I regretfully can't recommend Shuttle to anyone as film to watch and enjoy as a suspense, action or edge of your seat thriller. For you see Anderson made the mistake that Hitchcock warned all directors about.  That if you put the audience into suspense - by lets say - showing the audience a ticking time bomb in room full of people then let the audience stew like that for an extended period of time - then director should never let the bomb go off and kill anyone.

Well Anderson let the bomb go off all right - more then once - and then dropped an atom bomb at then end of the film. Shuttles last shots are pure nihilistic hopelessness. A complete heartbreaking, disturbing downer that darkly shades and puts a pall over the entire story. You will know what I'm talking about if you see it.

(some spoilers here)

My wife and I were into this film and following its twists and turns rooting for the good guys and cheering when the bad guys got theirs. Then ""The End"" hit and the wife turned to me and looked none to happy - ""At least they could have let one of them get away!"" she says.  A day latter she told me that she could not sleep or get the the film out her head and that if I ever brought a film home like that I would have to watch it alone.  Everything was fine, we were having a good time...until ""The End."" My mood was not so hot either.  A really good thriller is usually fun to talk about afterwords - We didn't discuss Shuttle at all.

My conclusion is, Anderson, with Shuttle as a first film has proved himself as a writer and director. He can get very very good performances from relatively new actors, he can tell a story well, and make it move forward, he knows how to create suspense, atmosphere and action, he is able to make a very difficult and tight situations work (filming inside a small bus in the dark) and he achieved an A-film look and feel on a B-film budget.

Shuttle might have been in minor classic territory had Anderson tweaked the ending just ever so slightly. Just to give the audience the ability to dig themselves out of a dark hole in their heads. For instance had Anderson ended the film with a cop putting Mel's video tape from the grocery store in a tape player or had he shown a signer translating the tape at the police station or shown the cops picking up Mr Shuttle at the airport. But he didn't do anything like this and I will not recommend the film to most folks because of it.

That said Shuttle is well made and Anderson is very capable and I look forward to his next project.

So if you chose to climb aboard this ride - I have warned you - Shuttle is a good grueling, tense and suspenseful little thriller but due to its uncompromising, nihilistic and hopeless ending - it's not going to be a fun ride and you will most likely hate its destination.",1272412800,2,6119,4.4658886894075405

3702961,2,B001MYIXBQ,"Shuttle is 106 minutes long.  If it had been a third of that, I would be writing a completely different, four-star review.

The premise -- a handful of strangers hop on an airport shuttle that takes them on a hellish ride -- is an old, old, old idea.  It can be found in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Midnight-Meat-Train/dp/B001MFNB4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Midnight Meat Train</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Train/dp/B002NJBPXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Train</a>, and...uh...many other movies about trains.  (Sorry.  It's late here, and I'm drawing a blank.  I'm sure you horror fans can think of other flicks that follow the Misleading Ride plot.)  That doesn't make it bad.  In fact, even though -- going into it -- you know our protagonists are stepping into the jaws of pain, the cinematography at the airport does add some lush suspense to the proceedings.  (This, however, might be a function of my Christmas travel experiences, which had me stranded at JFK airport for two days.  But I digress again.)

Once we step aboard the shuttle, though, the movie goes south.  Films like this always ask you to suspend your disbelief, but this one goes too far, if you ask me (I won't spoil anything for you; my specific complaints can be found in the comments section).  Likewise, the backbone of this thriller (it can't accurately be called horror) is nothing but the tension that exists when the killer loses control and for a brief moment it looks like our victims might get away.  When this tried-and-true cat-and-mouse formula is done well and sparingly, it can be quite effective.  In this movie, it happens roughly a dozen times.  Just like the boy who cried wolf, the more times the protagonists escape only to be caught again, the less interesting the film becomes.

The movie is in no hurry to be interesting, though.  It drags out the drive needessly, and even after the shuttle arrives at its destinaton, the movie putters around its point like an old man who won't finish his story because he likes the attention.  The ending of the film contains a truly terrifying concept, but I was so bored by that point that I failed to care much at all.",1267142400,3,2256,5.251396648044692

3702966,3,B001MYIXBQ,"I wasn't expecting anything much from this movie considering that I didn't recognize any of the cast. The plot seemed simple enough - two attractive young women, Mel [Peyton List] and Jules [Cameron Goodman] are back from a trip to Mexico and decide to take a cheap shuttle service, whose driver [Tony Curran] seems initially perturbed when two young men decide to come along. There's also an existing passenger, Andy [Cullen Douglas]who appears jittery and nervous. Well, predictably enough, the driver has other designs on his mind than just a cheap fare, and the girls as well as boys find themselves having to fight for their very survival.

Though the premise may not seem unique for its genre - a couple of things made this movie an above average viewing experience. The acting is really quite good for an unknown cast, especially the two female leads. These girls can actually act! Secondly, there are quite a few twists in this movie, some I didn't see coming, and that too was refreshing. That being said, I did feel that the movie suffered from a couple of plot implausibilities, i.e. the 'victims' not being able to take on the driver despite being given numerous chances to do so, the almost superhuman resilience of said driver despite being thrashed etc. The movie is also overly long - about 1 hr 50 mins, resulting in parts that dragged [a run time of 90 mins would have sufficed]. I did find the altercations between Mel [Peyton List] and the driver [Tony Curran] to be well-done, and the tension between them was the highlight of the film. All in all, this is an engaging thriller that takes an even darker turn at the end - one does have to suspend belief in some parts, and simply enjoy the performances.",1249257600,5,1724,4.68976897689769
3702967,3,B001MYIXBQ,"Directed by Edward Anderson Shuttle is a thriller/horror that really is better than I had expected it to be. Seeing the trailers ahead of time I wasn't very impressed or excited to watch it. But I am very open minded when it comes to horror, so I will pretty much watch anything. You never know what films could be good or bad until you experience them for yourself. Granted this isn't horror heaven and it does stretch the truth a lot. But usually the more unbelievable a scary movie is, in most cases the better it turns out to be. Like in real life women do not always fall down when they are running, or always go up the stairs, ect. So when watching this particular film you have to be really open minded and not pick apart if four or five people could or could not take on one man. I rate this based on the acting( Which was very good). The direction of Shuttle was dark and dreary(Which I loved a lot). There were great characters in the film( You tend to like all of them in the end). I also thought the writing was up to par. (Very sadistic and deranged). You end up asking yourself in the end if that could really happen, I think it's a possiblity in this messed up and unknown universe. The film brought us plenty of gore and a lot of suspense that was greatly enjoyable. There are a few twists in the movie that I imagine noone sees coming.

 Two young women who are just getting back from a trip to Mexico find themselves caught in a deadly game of survival after taking from what seems to be a normal shuttle ride home.

 This film will have you thinking twice about taking rides from cheaper shuttles or for that fact riding home with anyone who is unknown to you. Buckle up or maybe in this case you shouldn't, and enjoy the ride. I do recommend this for a fun and entertaining watch for horror fans.

To criticize the story itself is meaningless - good  thriller/horror movies expect us to put aside belief and be entertained, to be grossed out and to empathize with the characters. This movie does that well.

It's lack of success at the box office is probably because it is not easily pigeonholed.

Apparently it is as far as this movie is concerned, as Edward Anderson only seemed interested in figuring out how could stretch his premise out to feature length. This unfortunately means that, despite the fact that our protagonists are given several opportunities to escape from or kill their captor, they consistently blow their chances for freedom and survival. (I can understand their early reluctance to take a life, but after watching the driver mercilessly kill innocent people, I think that they would lose their inhibitions.) Their captor, by the way, seems to be possessed of superhuman endurance, as he takes all kinds of abuse throughout the film but keeps operating at full strength. (The fact that he allows it to happen at all is pretty ludicrous, given the fact that we're led to believe that he's been doing this for years. These seem like the mistakes of an amateur, things he should have planned for by this point.) Worst of all, the whole movie builds up to an anti-climax that is somewhat offensive in its exploitation of a real world tragedy. (I half-expected the movie to have self-important delusions of relevancy, displaying some text at the end to inform the viewers about this ongoing injustice.)

If you're a professional, cold-blooded criminal, as we're lead to believe of the shuttle driver, then you DO NOT kidnap two random girls from an AIRPORT in AMERICA to sell into slavery. The risk/reward numbers make no sense at all, and the movie piles more nonsense on top of that. This is torture porn, plain and simple. Unless that's your jam, you should move along.

Here's the longer version with more spoilers and more spleen (though I assert this movie cannot be spoiled, since it began life as trash-garbage). Like I said, no professional criminal is going to grab two random women from an airport in America to sell them into slavery. Aside from the fact that airports have cameras EVERYWHERE, how do you know they aren't the daughters of a mob boss or a drug lord, or (no offense to LGTBQ) they're pre-op transsexuals (unless your client is into that sort of thing), or maybe they're Spec-Ops soldiers on holiday and they know fifteen ways to kill you with the contents of your own pockets? You don't know, because you picked them AT RANDOM. I could go on, but the rest of the movie kind of makes my point for me - pretty much everything that CAN go wrong for this guy DOES go wrong - two strong young men (who also could be anybody from organized crime to glob-globbing wizards for all the shuttle driver knows) join the party. All his special supplies get set on fire. He gets stabbed. He gets beat up. He gets HIT BY HIS OWN VAN. He. Gets. SHOT. It's almost like these people don't want to be kidnapped and refuse to just allow it to happen to them, which probably happens to you a lot if your career path is ""kidnap random people from airports"" (yeah, we are supposed to believe the shuttle driver does this for a living). After all that, he ends up killing one of the women he worked so hard to get; why? She's got an STI...you know, like a RANDOM WOMAN MIGHT HAVE, which is why professionals DON'T PICK PEOPLE AT RANDOM.
That's just the premise - it gets worse. The main characters get the drop on the villain on numerous occasions, and as the shuttle driver racks up injuries, it gets increasingly preposterous that he doesn't just lie down and die, let alone keep chasing these people. By the time he kills the two men and gets the women to his abandoned warehouse lair, he's been hit by his own van - that's the kind of ouchie that would make Jason Freaking Borne pause for a minute, but he just keeps on going. The thing that makes me hate this movie so much is that all the nonsense builds up gradually; you don't really stop to think at all until he overcomes them AGAIN after being hit by his own van, so you keep watching until, after killing one of the girls because she turned out to have an STI (what if both girls had STIs? would his whole painful night have been ruined?), he gets stabbed in the thigh with a piece of glass the size of a pizza slice, then shot in the head with a large-caliber revolver at point-blank range. Instead of dying so we can have a bittersweet triumph for our last remaining girl as she drives away, he catches up to her, pulls her out of the car she stole, and muscles her into a shipping container. I wish I was kidding. Once I saw that, the whole movie unraveled for me, and I realized I'd been tricked into watching some really disgusting torture fantasy. The cherry on top of this garbage sundae was that once Shuttle Driver Man had gone through the kind of night that would have been bad for Jason Vorhees and had successfully caged this girl for transport, it turned out his plan for her was to ship her overseas in a steel shipping container with cat litter for a toilet, some bottles of water, and a bunch of energy bars for food...because who cares if this girl you went through hell to abduct dies in transport, amiright? It's not like they'd deny payment on account of dead merchandise :3
Absolutely ridiculous - the movie exists to make bad things happen to pretty young characters (i.e. torture porn) and since I can't unwatch it, I vent about it to save others from the same fate :P",1517270400,2,4369,4.4818067754077795
