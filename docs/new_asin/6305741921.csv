1063990,5,6305741921,"As much as I like Steven Soderbergh, most of his movies have some sort of flaw that keeps them from being true classics, but not The Limey.  It is perfection.  I wasn't very familiar with Terrance Stamp before, but now I  am a believer (I want to see Poor Cow especially, but it is tough to find  in the States).  Peter Fonda does an ironic take on his Easy Rider hippie  image.  Imagine if Captain America had lived, sold out, and enjoyed  bursting young peoples bubbles about the sixties (""it was only 66 and  early 67""), and you have Terry Valentine.  The other actors were  convincing, making the most of small roles, especially Barry Newman as  Avery, Valentine's  mean spirited bodyguard.  The aethetic aspects of The  Limey are also very impressive.  The editing is great and the  cinematography is totally unique.  Terrific soundtrack, too.  One of the  best movies of the year, and the best revenge movie since the days of Point  Blank and Get Carter.",953769600,5,960,4.662650602409639
1063991,5,6305741921,"I had read mixed reviews of The Limey and could not figure out the reason.  Once I viewed the film on DVD it became clear exactly why some were put off by this simple tale of revenge.  From the beginning the plot and the  visuals are very jumpy and non-linear.  As the film progresses, everything  become linear and very clear.  This device is used to express the confusion  and blind rage of a father which transforms into sadness with a feeling of  closure. As usual Soderbergh creates a visually dazzling film with  rock-solid actors.  One can see a progression from ""The  Underneath"" to ""Out of Sight"" to ""The Limey"".  The  genre of film noir in broad daylight seems to be uniquely his.  I recommend  this to the art-house crowd more than I would people looking for a straight  actioneer.",953683200,5,792,4.589928057553957
1063992,4,6305741921,This follow up to (Out of Sight) is Actually the third of what I like to call The Soderberg Triology. This film along with (The Underneath) and(Out of Sight) Prove that Soderberg has no equal in this genre. The Limey is a  smart thriller with two brilliant performances at it's core. Terrence Stamp  was unjustly overlooked during the Oscar nominations. Brilliant I say. The  Disc is of the highest quality. The Commentary is very insightful and quite  entertaining. If you like This Genre this is the disc for you.,953596800,3,515,4.752808988764045
1063993,4,6305741921,"Steven Soderbergh and Lem Dobbs have created a very cool movie.  While the film jumps around in time and space, the film is never confusing.  My one complaint is the commentary tracks on the DVD.  The first (by Soderbergh  and Dobbs) is styled just like the movie.  While this was cool at first, it  got old after while.  I guess that I am old fashioned when it comes to my  DVD commentary tracks, I just want a plain old track that tells me about  the making of the movie.  My other complaint is on the second commentary  track Peter Fonda starts a story that never gets finished (the one about  the email from Terence Stamp).
However, these complaints are minor  compaired to how much I liked the movie.  Terence Stamp is the epitome of  cool, while Peter Fonda is a very creepy villian.  I give this film my  highest recomendation.",953596800,2,834,4.453333333333333
1063994,4,6305741921,"Stevens Soderbergh's follow up to Out of Sight is a sylish and intense movie about one mans quest for revenge. Terrence Stamp plays ""wilson"" a english theif hellbent on avenging his daughters  ""accidental"" death. Stamp is amazing in the role and you can't  take your eyes off him when he's on screen. This is my favorite Soderbergh  film to date and well worth picking up on DVD. Lots of extras on the DVD  and is a must for noir fans. EXCELLENT!",953424000,3,446,4.469135802469136
1063995,5,6305741921,"This was one of my favorites of 1999. Terence Stamp is incredible, a rather sinister good guy; like Dirty Harry with a conscience.
What really makes this film so amazing, is the theme of time. Time has been taken from  his life, leaving him with regret about the past and a what should have  been. I don't want to say much because I would hate to give away  anything.
There aren't really any ""bad guys"" in this film. It's  beyond that. Terence's character is perhaps his own worst enemy.
It's a  powerful, stylish, thrilling film. It reinvents a genre in a much less  forced way than, say, Pulp Fiction. There may be cinematographic tricks,  but they serve a purpose, the stream of consciousness in the mind of a  confused, angry, sad man.
As for The Who's song, ""The Seeker"";  well, that is the opening theme and fits in so well and explains so much.  Kind of like ""Sounds of Silence"" at the beginning of The  Graduate.
So you gotta see this film. It's sooo worth it. Oh, and by the  way, it's also really funny.",953251200,5,1013,4.416216216216216

1063997,5,6305741921,"Steven Soderbergh's follow up to his wonderful 1998 film ""Out of Sight"" is more understated and subtle than most people might imagine. The Limey is in many respects the closest Hollywood has come in years to  filming a modern film noir picture.
The main plot of the Limey is of  little to no importance. Terence Stamp plays a bitter old Englishmen who  comes to LA to seek revenge for his murdered daughter. His pursuit of  vengeance eventually leads him to a sleazy record producer, brilliantly  played by Peter Fonda.
The Limey is a film that revolves around its use  of atmosphere. Soderbergh, forever a film geek, uses cuts in time and  flashbacks (a constant one to Stamp on a plane) to establish a dark gritty  atmosphere which he manages to sustain throughout the whole film.  The  scripting is a perfect fabrication of a film noir, every character is  menacingly constructed to be a worn out tough guy.
If anything negative  can be said about the film is that it seems to go on a little long. In  actuality the film is perfect length but the many scenes without dialogue  make it seem longer than it is. Time and time again does Soderbergh cut to  shots of Stamp staring into thin air reflecting. It establishes atmosphere  wonderfully but if you are looking for a wild ride of an action movie the  Limey is not your cup of tea.
The Limey is a movie that would be adored  by serious film fans but despised by the kind of people who go to the  theatre just to watch a fun popcorn movie. If you got this far and you're  reading this review then you probably love films.",952905600,53,1575,4.47887323943662
1063998,5,6305741921,Let me tell you...this movie kicked some serious boo-Taa! Totally worth the $$$$! I haven't seenthe Dvd Version yet..however...in this professional reviewers eyes: It just beats out Jaws The Revenge! 10 out of 10 my friends.,952387200,,224,5.25
1063999,4,6305741921,"Steven Soderbergh has got a movie making jones that I really enjoy, and he keep it commin' in ""The Limey.""  More character devoted than plot driven, it's still a cool ride.  SS's editing style and narrative lend  itself to become the main character's inner voice.  Through a great  non-linear structure we seem to recall events along with our hero as he  flys coach across the Atlantic.
It's an awesome premise for story design  and sells the film more than anything else, although Terence Stamp's  performance (including some stuff he did 30 years ago) is a ton 'o  fun.

1064956,5,6305741921,"I remember being blown away the first time I saw The Limey in a theater, and it still holds up after all these years.  Director Steven Soderbergh takes a fairly conventional, straight-up story of an ex-con come to the US to avenge/learn the truth about the death of his daughter, and fragments the narrative with fragments and short snippets that repeat over and over again, sometimes moving back, and sometimes moving forward.  A critic noted that it's a striking evocation of the phenomenon of memory.  After all, we rarely relive things in a straight line, but turn over elements and scenes repeatedly in our heads as we try to extract meaning from them.  Add a steely-eyed performance by the great Terence Stamp in the title role, coupled with footage from his first collaboration with Ken Loach, add a terrific performance from Luis Guzmn as the unexpected Sancho sidekick, and Peter Fonda as the creepiest evocation of the sixties, and you have quite the viewing experience.  The only downside is that it would have benefitted from more women, and some of the dialogue is embarrassingly sexist.  Soderbergh would make up for this with Erin Brockovich, but this is worth a look.",1473206400,2,1183,4.89

The same problem exists with the out-of-order video sequences at the beginning of many scenes.  Instead of adding to the impact of the plot, it sharply detracts from it.

I have no issue with nonlinear storytelling and I believe it could have been done better here but to me most of the memory sequences were frivolous and distracting. Some tighter editing could have improved this movie overall. The acting was good and the overall story is mostly plausible. I find it unlikely a career criminal with a non-violent or at least non-murderous past would go on such a violent killing spree but I think it could be explained because when family is involved all bets are off. I enjoy revenge movies and it's refreshing to see one without a standard ending.

Of course, Terence has a trademark intense stare that lends emphasis to it.  There is also a comment on the commercialization rampant in our society which exploits and degrades, in this case, the pop hip culture of the late 60s and early 70s by an iconic, immoral, two-dimensional character ably portrayed by Peter Fonda, who of course has his own connection to that period.",1472774400,,711,4.859504132231405

I approached this current viewing with high expectations. Unfortunately I did not find that the film stood the test of time. Perhaps since I already knew the plot, it didn't seem as innovative as it did twenty years ago. Also in the intervening years the revenge genre of film has upped the ante with realistic fight scenes, visceral shots showing the result of violence, and saving or avenging a powerless (usually female) character. The Limey's violence is more subtle (even the shootout at the end). So perhaps I have become conditioned to expect more ""in your face"" action like we see today from Damon, Denzel or Neeson, but in any event The Limey left me wanting more.",1471305600,,849,4.782312925170068

1065920,2,6305741921,"The Limey stinks. It's about Terence Stamp, an ex con from England (who sounds Australian to me) travels to Los Angeles to find the person/people responsible for the murder of his daughter.  Turns out there's been rumors his daughter wasn't exactly a nice girl, which based on the ending is probably incorrect.  Then again it's only logical a father would remember the happy memories of their daughter.

The problem is that the acting is very cliched and overblown of the murder/mystery genre, the story's incredibly short at around 85 minutes, the writing is poor for the most part, and the acting isn't much better.  In fact often the acting is unintentionally hilarious such as when Terence tosses a guard over the building without anyone seeing it, or when he envisions the person he wants to kill (which is also a confusing segment because he envisions this a few times and we're tricked into thinking each one is real).

There's really only two good scenes- the beginning when Terence gets tossed out of a building, only to walk back in and retaliate by shooting three oversized men dead (eerily graphic atmosphere in fact) and the shootout at the very end.  Films released in 1999 haven't aged well at all.  Not all of them aged poorly of course, but several.  Clearly this one hasn't aged well.

Peter Fonda is an exaggerated business person perfect for the role of a conniving person you dislike and someone you want to see Terence shoot and kill, and of course Amelia Heinle is incredibly hot.  So you obviously have the scrawny weasel and the hot chick.  Terrible.  But these two actors are both predictable of murder/mystery films which makes them boring and fake in my eyes.

The best moments are whenever Terrence sneaks around looking for the bad guys.  He's good at that role, but these moments don't happen nearly enough.  I thought the movie was going to improve when hit men were written into the story to take Terence out, but even they never managed to accomplish anything memorable with the exception of one scene when cops intervened in the nick of time.

His Biblical devotion to excising evil as he finds it is powerful. The use of non-linear time expertly underlines the narrative, showing not only scenes or snippets of scenes again, but from different camera angles. One thus enters a kind of dream about events or conversations that seem to have happened, but one can't be sure. What one is sure of is a gripping story.

Luis Guzman becomes Stamp's right hand man in the quest to find out what happened as well as justice. The hunt is on, but it is mostly Stamp spouting archaic British slang and busting a few heads or shooting someone along the way. Peter Fonda's clueless character does little to impress and his own henchmen are cut straight from TV, with none rising to the level one would expect from this director and cast. It boils down to a script that needed considerable re-writing instead of a budget that would have been better spent on something else.

1066086,4,6305741921,"I mostly don't like Steven Soderbegh films at all, but this quite original 1999 crime film is one of the exceptions. Below, you will find more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Old school British gangster Wilson (Terence Stamp) who spent more than half of his life in prison, travels to Los Angeles to investigate the death of his daughter Jenny, who supposedly died in a car accident. He suspects that Jenny's last boyfriend (or rather sugar daddy, as he was easily 30 years older than her) record producer Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda) had her killed. This film tells the story of his investigation and its consequences.

This film immediately reminded me of old 1971 classic ""Get Carter"" with Michael Caine - and in fact Steven Soderbegh wanted initially Caine to play the main role. Finally he had to settle for Terence Stamp and I think that actually did to this film a great deal of good, as Stamp offers here a STELLAR performance! The atmosphere of the film is however very ""getcarterish"", even if Los Angeles in Year of Grace 1999, even in its least glamorous parts looks definitely less gritty and more cheerful than Newcastle 1971 AD.

The character of Wilson (we never learn his first name) is different than that of Jack Carter. Here the gangster is older and speaks differently, frequently using a very colourful slang and his sense of humor is also quite different. Both men however are cold, ruthless career criminals, seemingly calm on the surface but boiling with rage inside, launched on a personal crusade against those who did them wrong and anybody who stands between them and their vengeance.

As I already said, the few films by Steven Soderbegh I ever saw, I usually didn't like them a lot. I hated ""Solaris"", ""Traffic"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" bored me almost to death and even if I found ""Erin Brokovitch"" and ""Contagion"" watchable I do not intend to see them ever again. And let's not even talk about his hagiography of Saint Che Guevara, co-creator of the vicious Cuban tyranny and brutal murderer of thousands... This film however I found better than others and I especially liked the quite unique technique of narration, in which the story is told simultaneously in a way linear and not linear, when in teh same time keeping things clear and logical - this is quite an achievement!

The one thing that prevents me from giving it five stars is the very ending, like the last minute of the film. I couldn't understand this thing very well - either the director decided to hide the whole solution of the film and depriveus of a real ending, or Wilson simply did all of this (including the killings) strictly for nothing... Maybe you will have better luck figuring this out.

So bottom line, this is a good, solid, artistically very interesting gangster film, with just one big black spot in its final minute. The latter thing notwithstanding, I will keep my DVD for a possible re-watch.",1389139200,,2924,4.7687747035573125

Anyway, this movie is fantastic.  Subtle acting--the fear of Peter Fonda and his crew, the simmering menace in a smallish, oldish Terence Stamp's delivery of the simple line ""Name's Wilson""--the fact that the resolution offers the main character no real resolution, and of course the prescient nod to reality TV (now everybody is watching ""Big Fat Guy"" or something like it) are sheer brilliance.

It is an interesting study of vengeance by the father of a murdered girl who comes to America to find and kill her murderers. There is an interesting subplot in which an older and unreleased film by Terence Stamp is used to show the backstory when he was a young man and his daughter was a child. This subplot finally explains what has happened in the modern story. It is similar and far superior to a recent film called ""Taken."" In both cases, the father, who has near superhuman skills, takes off after a man who has kidnapped or ( in the Limey's case) murdered his daughter. This is a better film but both are enjoyable.

1066337,5,6305741921,"Director Steven Soderbergh's 1999 so-called crime-action film, The Limey, is easily the best film of Soderbergh's that I've ever seen. Part of this is due to the innovative narrative structure that makes all but the most of the last few minutes of this great film a flashback, and the rest is due to an excellent script by screenwriter Lem Dobbs, whose other great success came a year earlier, in Alex Proyas's sci fi film Dark City. Both films, despite their seeming divergence, are acutely focused on human memory, and both deal with the fragility of such in novel ways. In fact, in rewatching The Limey on DVD, after six or seven years, and then watching it with the two available audio commentary tracks, I'm amazed to have seen something in the film that no other critic apparently has, and that is the fact that the viewer is never sure whether or not any or all of the remembered scenes depicted are, indeed, real (within the fictive cosmos the film resides in).

The 85 minute long film quickly sets up the idea that the protagonist, named simply Wilson (and seemingly the same character as that portrayed in Ken Loach's 1967 film Poor Cow (called either Dave, or Dave Wilson- I'm not sure for I've never seen that film, and there are conflicting accounts as to whether of not that character had both names revealed), and portrayed by Terence Stamp, is an ex-con out for revenge following the seeming accidental death of his daughter Jennifer (Melissa George- as an adult), a young woman who was living with a shady L.A.-based record mogul named Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda). Within the film's first ten minutes viewers get the first 'action' scene of violence, and already identify heavily with the lead character, Wilson. The bulk of the rest of the film is about Wilson's memories (or fantasies?) of his daughter, from the time he is on board a return flight from L.A to the U.K., and all the critics agree that the film is a series of memories, even if they disagree about what is the actual present time it displays. Some critics, as example, claim the airplane scenes represent flashforths, not flashbacks; some that seem to be chronological (although the scenes seem to be in proximate chronological groupings, not individually chronological), while others are not; but not a single critic seems to have ever questioned the verity of what Wilson's memories are, or, if indeed, they are strictly memories, and not fantasies. After all, this film is a 'revenge film,' and revenge is, next to sex, the top theme of fantasies. Of course, some would argue that the scenes from Poor Cow seem to imply Wilson is all that he claims to be. But we only get snippets of this. Is Wilson really an ex-con? Likely. Is he in L.A. looking for revenge? Likely. But after that, is anyone really sure what is memory and what is fantasy, and, indeed, if Wilson's 'memory' is accurate? The Limey is the rare example of that most overused and abused term, an utter cinematic masterpiece that explores memory as a thing in itself, as a way to communicate, as well as a form of regret. It asks serious queries of the human psyche- not just those of kind like what is good?, or what is evil?, but those of degree like what constitutes a crime?, and when does it become a crime?, as well as the aforementioned queries of whether the film, the vehicle for this philosophizing, is dream, memory, fantasy, and if Wilson ever really gets (or got) off that airplane? To return to the aforementioned film, Another Woman, that film ends with the explicit question: Is a memory something you have or something you've lost? The Limey shows better than any film I can think of, that the answer to that query can be neither or both.",1248825600,,3711,4.691717791411043
1066338,4,6305741921,"As far as I can recall I have seen Terence in very few flicks. Last one I saw him in was in Get Smart..But of course that was a comedy. Bu that is far as a serious film, i must say he has very few that are proclaiming. This tome is a shame, he is a much underrated actor with immense talent, and this flick by Steven Sodenbourgh brings out the best in Sir Terence Stamp.

In The Limey we have Wilson, and aging crook, fresh out of the joint, and in search of his daughter's murderer. Wilson has a lead, he knows the man responsible, all he needs is time and the help he can get to accomplish the job.

The premise has been heard of before; the director however manages to craft the movie in a very original and stylish manner. Example is the fast forwarding events and flashbacking them as well...it gets a bit frustrating at times...but you have to admit that it does have an amazing impact once the movie is over.  There is barely if any B.S. in the movie; meaning that what you see is believable and realistic. No hero crap here, everything done a la old fashion. Keep in note that the movie also incorporates scenes from another movie, to show Stamp's character as a young lad in prison.

This movie however is not for everyone. It's different, yes, but it's a style that is appreciated long after the first view. I know this for certain; I had to view it more than 3 times to like it. It's now on my top 25 due its fresh look and slick editing. Definitely a must own if you are into something fresh and new.

But after I allowed myself to be drawn into the film's world, I enjoyed it immensely. Unlike typical characters in film ""thrillers,"" the players in ""The Limey"" were understated, seemingly more authentic. Although nothing like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The Limey's"" often offhand dialogue had the same charm.

If you enjoy a character study by an interesting actor (Terrence Stamp) you should like this. This one is about a British criminal (Stamp) getting out of jail, finding out that something bad had happened to his daughter in Los Angeles, and going for the man (Peter Fonda) he feels is responsible for that. This revenge tale is done differently. It almost reminded of the old film noirs of the `40s and `50s.

There is a bit too much flashback in here, so you have to be prepared to put up with that. Of note, the filmmakers used actual film footage from a 1967 film of Stamp to show him in his younger days.

What I did really enjoy was Stamp's vocabulary and the interesting looks on his face. The supporting cast also adds nicely to this story, particularly Barry Newman, who plays Fonda's bodyguard. There isn't a lot of action in here but when it does occur, it's pretty intense.",1236816000,,1085,4.415

With a riveting Terrence Stamp, a thoroughly retro neo-noir storyline, some great lines, an intriguing DEA agent and inspired direction all wrapped up in a 90-minute package, The Limey is an overlooked gem.",1232064000,,224,5.222222222222222
1066342,5,6305741921,"Steven Soderbergh's ""The Limey"" is an understatement of an understatement punctuated by almost unbearable raptures of emotion--it's as though Soderbergh wanted to make the standard Hollyword fare of ""Vengeance is Mine"" into an inside joke and make it serious again within 90 minutes.

Terence Stamp gives one of the best performances I have ever seen (by turns hilarious and horrifying) as the Wilson, a British ex-con who discovers that his daughter has been killed in an ""accidental death"" orchestrated by a washed up sleazebag music producer played masterfully
by Peter Fonda.  Luis Guzman, an ex-con who knows Wilson and who got his life straightened out, has a begrudging respect for the aging oddball thug and helps him on his mission.  For once Guzman is not angry, violent criminal; he is a reformed one.

Soderbergh has the ability to take the most brutal scenes and transform them into utter comedy--when Wilson attends a party thrown by Valentine (Fonda) stands out on the producers' luxurious terrace overlooking theo cean, having repeated fantasies of simply walking in and shooting him (which he is perfectly capable of doing).  Valentine tells his 400 pound bodyguard to go have a chat with Wilson. In a very quick motion seen from Fonda's perspective, Wilson headbutts the bodyguard and throws him off the terrace.  He then grins goofily into the party at Fonda.

The story of Wilson's daughter Jenni is not one bit funny though.  A young girl who had to watch her father go to prison (or get ""banged up"" numerous times as he puts it) it is really no wonder that she would get involved with a sleazebag like Valentine--another criminal.  Wilson's memories of Jenni are heartbreaking but loving.  The film ""Memento"" took more than a fair share from this movie.

Wilson is an unstoppable force.  Nothing Valentine does can prevent his wrath.  There is a twist at the end though that has stuck in my mind ever since, a riddle Soderbergh poses.  Masterpiece.",1230336000,,1970,4.966463414634147
1066343,5,6305741921,"After watching ""The Limey"" I was in awe of what I had beheld.  This movie was dynamic and mute simultaneously.  The genre of this film is a neo-noir, in other words a modern version of those crime/mysteries films made back in the golden days of cinema.  These old school movies were black and white, ""noir"" is French for ""black"", hence the term film noir.

A thousand apologies for the deviation on my cinema history lesson, I will return to the review at hand.  I have to say that I am on the fence with Steve Soderbergh's work.  Some of his movies are great; I loved the remake of Solaris in 2002, ""Out of Sight"" and ""Traffic"".  Consequently, I hated all of the ""Ocean"" films and ""Full Frontal"". So I wasn't sure what to except from ""The Limey"".  In the end, I feel Soderbergh hit the nail on the head.  The acting, editing, cinematography, acting and story were stellar.

The plot is simplistic; Terence Stamp plays a British ex-con who has traveled to Los Angeles to ""investigate"" the murder of his estranged daughter Jenny.  In the process, he hooks up with some of his daughter's friends (played well by Lesley Ann Warren and Luis Guzman) in order to solve the conundrum of his Jenny's death in a very conspiratorial fashion.  Jenny was involved with a ritzy music producer (played smoothly by Peter Fonda), who appears to have his hand in her death.

What I thought was sort of neat about this film is the use of flashbacks.  The movie ""Poor Cow"" was used in order to provide flashback's to Terence Stamp's character.  ""Poor Cow"" featured Stamp at a much younger age and worked well with ""The Limey"".  I don't think I have ever seen this technique used in a movie before.  As for the editing, I found it amazing.  It might annoy some viewers; it is somewhat non-liner in fashion.  The editing sort of displaces some scenes in the continuity of the film and/or foreshadows events.  There is also a distressed emphasis of dialogue with the editing.  Characters will be in one setting and then switch to another, while the dialogue is still going. There might even be a scene where the dialogue is going and none of the characters are speaking.  It reminded me somewhat of the movie ""Memento"".

I have heard some criticism of Terence Stamp's character in this movie.  That he displayed neither emotion nor it didn't seem plausible that he would be that intense about finding who did or didn't kill his daughter.  Also it seemed odd that Jenny's friends would aid her father that Jenny herself was never totally copasetic with.  I believe the retort to that theory is that both Jenny's friends and father are aiding one and other out of restitution for their lack of involvement in what happened to Jenny.  Perhaps, from their perception, they could have done more to prevent Jenny's ominous outcome.  As for the end of the movie, I had to sit and really think about it.  Perhaps I am being a bit too quixotic, but once I processed and digested this film, I felt very gratified with the conclusion.

I suppose I can understand why someone might not like this movie.  It isn't a shoot out revenge film and there isn't non-stop action in it.  Nevertheless if one is able to get submerged in the story, they might find that this 90 minute or so movie goes by quickly.  I also found the soundtrack amazing and I ordered it as soon as the movie ended.  The score was done by Cliff Martinez, who has scored many of Soderbergh's films, including the hypnotic score to Solaris (2002).

My only regret about ""The Limey"" is that I hadn't seen it sooner.",1213574400,2,3546,4.574603174603174
1066344,4,6305741921,"The Limey is an action movie that transcends the genre because of excellent acting, photography, and direction.

The story has been covered many times by other reviewers.  My comment is that the ending is enigmatic, which adds to the movie's appeal.  The characters are deftly, but sparsely written and portrayed.

The color combinations, the lighting, and the extensive use of close-ups speak to the quality of the photography.  The care that went into the shooting of many scenes in this movie is better than many art house movies.  This movie is eye-candy much as the neo-noir Wild Things is.

Finally, the direction is excellent.  The quality of the jump-cut editing, the inclusion of fantasy scenes to head fake the watcher, and the excellence with both broad panoramas (the trip up to Big Sur is fantastic) and close-ups (e.g., Wilson on the jet from London to LA) are done again render this near art house quality.

To be clear, this is a thriller/action movie.  There are lots of bad people in it and they suffer bad outcomes; sometimes visible, sometimes left imagined.

1066410,5,6305741921,"Terrence Stamp is taking a plane back to England after some dirty business in Los Angeles.  While on the plane, he thinks back, not only on what he has just done, but on his life and the choices he has made (and perhaps should have).
His memories are unreliable, as memories will be, and you are left to sort through them.
What some might mistake for continuity errors are actually faulty memories.  Characters appear in different clothes, say things differently each time certain scenes are replayed.  Sometimes he hears only what he wants to hear.  Later, he often realizes that he missed something crucial in what was being said.  At times he replays all the possibilities of what he could have done (see his first encounter with Peter Fonda), and in others he is imagining what must have transpired beyond the limits of his observation.
Much has been made of the editing and non-linear story line as being nothing but gimmicks.  But in this case, these are not tricks, but instead are essential devices for understanding his character and his actions.
Beautifully filmed and solidly acted, The Limey plays out like a dream, flows like a poem, and leaves the viewer with the task of deciding what is what.
Ostensibly a revenge film, The Limey is more of a character study and a meditation on who is really to blame when things go this wrong.
This film is not for careless diversionary viewing.  It takes a little time and work, but (in this reviewer's mind) it's well worth the effort.",1202947200,,1488,4.7
1066411,4,6305741921,"The movie had a unique visual style and was often beautiful to watch, though I found the constant editing, which made for somewhat avant-garde cinematography, kind of jarring and unsettling, even off-putting at times.  At other times, I found the concentrated attention required to follow so many sound overlays and picture splices to be almost meditative!  Were the story a little more interesting, perhaps I'd have thought more of the technique.

OK, it was something new and deserving of recognition, but flashy editing can't be the entire reason for greatness in a film.  In terms of plot, this wasn't a terribly exciting movie.  Something in the anti-hero's quest for revenge (which was in fact the whole story) left me less than satisfied.  Peter Fonda's character was often more likeable and sympathetic than Terence Stamp's.  After Stamp has offed a countless number of other guys in his pursuit, he finally gets to ask Fonda the real circumstances surrounding his daughter's death and there is some irony in the answer he receives.. this is the story in a nutshell.  While Stamp's character was half-interesting, it was difficult to care a great deal about his revenge, not having seen the injustice perpetuated on his daughter.  Furthermore, Fonda being a more or less amiable guy made it hard to really sympathize with the whole revenge mission.

There were some interesting minor characters in the movie which helped move things along.  Fonda's bodyguard added a few more volts, as did the pool-playing street assassin and his semi-retarded partner.

Had the story created more interest (in Stamp's revenge?), I'd probably have better appreciated this experiment in editing, which was original, though seeming to delay the story at times, rather than enhancing it. This review may not give the impression, but overall it was a decent movie and I don't regret having seen it.  I just don't think Soderbergh's 'stir-fry', or collage-style, editing techniques made it a 5 star movie.",1202601600,,1992,5.130030959752322

""The Limey"" was released just six months before ""Erin Brockovich"", and as you may remember, it was the second film which brought the accolades for Soderbergh those days, with five nominations and one win (best leading actress, Julia Roberts) at the Academy Awards. Ok. It wasn't a bad film, and most people actually need motivation. But ""The Limey"" is funky, less politically correct, and although the basic plot is pure greek tragedy, its nonlinear structure is more than tragic.

This is the film that made me change my major from marketing to film, and change my goals in business, and life.  Now that's an impact on at least one viewer. :-)  This is also the film, that I believe pushed Director Steven Soderbergh over the cusp of greatness.  Already with an impressive body of work in ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"", ""Gray's Anatomy"", and the outstanding thriller ""Out of Sight"", here the director applies the sum of his education, and gives you the the single most innovative revenge/crime thriller in American film.

I will touch on the plot briefly as far better writers than I already have well covered it dozens of times over.  Terrance Stamp portrays career con Wilson, a cockney Brit who travels to L.A. upon his release to get answers concerning the suspicious ""accidental"" death of his estranged daughter.  Upon arriving he makes contact with his daughters friend Eduardo, wonderfully portrayed by the usually underutilized Luis Guzman, and, voice/acting coach played by Lesley Ann Warren.  After cutting through some henchman types who had recently come in contact with Wilson's child, his path of revenge leads to aging 60's icon, record producer Terry Valentine.  Valentine is portrayed by the legendary Peter Fonda, who is at his most animated, and sleazy best as the cowardly Valentine.

Everybody in this film is absolutly terrific which is typical of a Soderbergh cast who seems to just bring the best out of a cast like nobody else.  One cast member who gets no notice in any of the reviews I have seen is Melissa George who in haunting flashbacks, and Wilson's imagination portrays his daughter Jenny.  I cannot give this young lady enough credit for giving such a revealing face to a character only seen in memory, with no voice, with no dialouge.  She is beautiful, meloncholy, and unforgettable and manages without ever speaking to give somekind of voice to the voiceless along with another young actress named Michela Gallo who does duties as the young child of Wilson's memories.

The direction of Sodergergh, and most importantly his cutting of the film alongside editor Sarah Flack is imaginitive, and daring.  The cut is as chaotic as the memories of a faded conman, who time passed by so long ago would be, yet the direction of this cut is nothing short of masterful.  Much like the era the antagonist/protagonist saw thier heyday in, Soderbergh weaves the surreal, with the very real, advances the story, and studies his ""hero"" in ways that I had never imagined before seeing ""The Limey"".  This film could not have been made without Stamp, and Soderbergh has said as much before.  The icon easily outperformed any and every actor in 1999, and got nothing in the way of nominations for this achievement, which I still think a travesty.  This is a film with excellent dialouge, but never relies on dialouge to explain, or advance, or develop.  The breadth of Wilson's development in our eyes is done for just that, our eyes.  Stamp's face, his eyes, his mouth, his body language tell us all we ever need to know.  It seems that everybody looks at this as a crime thriller, but really this is human drama, and character study at it's finest.

I've followed Soderbergh for many years, and this was a really fun step in his progession to the director who will soon be tackling Che Guavera in an epic that I had onced hoped to make.  But I won't hold it against him :-)

1066491,5,6305741921,"Probably not, but I love it and am giving it 5 stars anyway.

This movie sets out to be a very simple narrative, a quest/revenge story, in which Wilson, an aged cockney criminal fresh from a 9-year stint ""at Her Majesty's leisure,"" sets out to learn the truth about his estranged daughter's death in Los Angeles.  Along the way, though, it becomes a thoughtful story about self-discovery, of lives lived in one direction and understood (tragically too late) in another...as all lives are.

This flick is full of great performances.  Stamp is great as the cool, deliberate, and ruthless Wilson, a man who is not gratuitously violent, but not at all hesitant to use it when it suits his needs or satisfies his desire.  He is a fearless--and probably foolish--criminal who has spent half his life behind bars and has become thoughtful, introspective.

Barry Newman, another hippie-era cult star (Vanishing Point, 1971), fills his supporting role as Valentine's (Peter Fonda) head of security with a snarling grittiness that contrasts with Fonda's whiney, pampered aging record producer character hilariously.  Nicky Katt his equally hilarious as an idiot hitman who takes himself very seriously (""Hey, this is a lifestyle I embrace!"").

I don't think this movie's non-linear editing is at all confusing.  While shots from one part of the narrative are frequently inserted into scenes in another part, they make perfect sense within their ""new"" contexts, even if they are temporally out of place, and this editing reflects perfectly the idea that this story is one that is reflected upon, not told as it actually happens, and the realization that past actions can't help but define the present.

This movie is a treat, and worth seeing.  It's a shame the DVD doesn't have any interviews or commentary, though, because I would like that access to the artists' insights into their own work.",1115769600,5,1884,5.04516129032258
1066492,5,6305741921,"This is one of the finest crime dramas of recent years. Harkening back to another great film, 1971's Get Carter, Terrance Stamp plays an ex-con, Wilson, who has comes to America to discover the causes of his daughter's death. I found this a great film for many reasons:

Steven Soderbergh's direction was fascinating. He plays with time and images in a very interesting way, mixing up sharp close ups and long shots done out of time (some in flashback, some looking into the future). While this smacks hard of arty/indi filmmaking, I think with this film it really worked to tremendous advantage. There are several shots of Terrance Stamp in extreme close-up, focusing on his strange, pale blue eyes, while sun and shadow play across his face. I found these shots oddly moving, and after a second viewing I figured out why: in these shots the sunlight passes over his face like the rising and falling of the sun - like the passing of time. Soderbergh's direction is very tight throughout, and his shot selection is always excellent.

I love the casting of this movie. Terrance Stamp could not have been better, cast as Wilson, the cockney career criminal that has come to the plastic world of California looking for some very hard answers. His Wilson is a once-in-a-career creation, much like Clint Eastwood's, William Munny from The Unforgiven. Stamp really makes Wilson jump right off the screen in every scene he is in. Several good to great actors find their finest moments on film here, always playing against type. For once Lesley Ann Warren is NOT a bubble-headed sex starved vixen, but instead a woman with depth and intelligence. For once Luiz Guzman is NOT a slightly comic, second banana bad-guy Hispanic but instead a decent, complex man that proves his metal during the course of the film.

Peter Fonda plays a music mogul named Valentine with a heart of corruption beyond his melancholy reminisces of the 60's (who, in an offhand moment, explains the 60's perfectly in about 5 or 6 lines of dialogue). Barry Newman seems to come out of nowhere with a pitch perfect performance as a suave head of security for the Valentine empire.

Finally, watch for the two-man hit team of Nicky Katt and Joe Dallesandro, who are hired to kill Stamp. Nicky Katt gives a real, real creepy performance, nearly worth the price of admission by itself, and it was just great to see Dallesandro mixing it up again (Dallesandro comes out of the Andy Warhol factory and was Warhol's beefcake boy in several of his movies).

All in all, a film that will easily stand up to repeat viewings.

This is one you should have in your collection.",1115251200,3,2628,4.75219298245614
1066493,3,6305741921,"Check out the excellent review by Doug Anderson: Style Chosen Over Content, March 29, 2002. I agree with him 100%. Stamp is a fascinating actor to watch and listen to. He was very memorable in The Hit, especially in his reading of the John Donne sonnet; and he is not like anyone else. Here, he is totally unglamorous, even off-puttingly ugly, yet has a dominant persona. There is something wrong with this film, however, and perhaps it is just the director continually saying to himself and the audience: Look at me! I'm state of the art arty. The style is annoyingly obtrusive. Nearly the whole of the time your attention is completely taken up with the tricksy flashes --- to the point where nothing else seems to matter. Peter Fonda is too willowy for words. He doesn't seem to have enough spine even to cream off a money-laundering narcotics percentage, and it's difficult to envision him as anything more enterprising than a kept toy-boy, by someone like, say, Norma Desmond, or Ayn Rand. Amusing to see Liam from The Big Lebowski falling off the balcony: doesn't this actor ever get to speak? Well, now we know what his job was when he wasn't bowling.",1108425600,3,1158,4.681372549019608

1066495,4,6305741921,"I hate the idea, arrogantly enough, of people liking a great piece of art for all of the wrong reasons. Some I have heard have gone so far left field with metaphors about the title character of this film that they have even found a way to take the inexorable rage and focus of Terence Stamp's character in this movie completely out of the actual context of the film to make him a poster boy for the Conservative Right--an often ironically apt analogy, again, for all the wrong reasons.

What makes this film so great is the integrity of Soderberg to his central character and his unique and artistic relationship to the plot. He makes his style subserivent to the story in such a way as to create the artistic paradox that says he has done the exact opposite; the marriage of the two is perfect. Terence Stamp (who is brilliant in this by the way) is a ""Limey"" on a juggernaut's course of revenge for the man he holds responsible for the death of his only child, a grown daughter, in Los Angeles. Peter Fonda (who is not quite as good as Stamp but does get out of his character's way at moments that are beautifully real) plays one of the many archetypal Baby-Boomer roles in existence today: an insecure, narcississtic and weak playboy/Recording Executive with a drug problem and predilection for impressionable young girls. One of these girls in his past may have been the Limey's inexplicably dead daughter. These two men are separated by an entire world--an Atlantic Ocean in one sense, and seemingly antithetical cultures on another--with many people of all walks of life (and levels of both beauty and depravity) in between. It is the painful, mysterious death of a young woman in the vicinity of one of these men that links the two of them, and is the genesis of one man's mission against the other.

But that plot is merely the icing on the cake of this movie. It is nowhere near as powerful or as important as the theme, which could only be fully experienced by an observer (us, the audience) via the heart of the main character (the ""Limey"" himself). This is where Soderberg's style transcends the boundaries of simple ability and approaches genius. Through the majestic techniique of breaking the time line with numerous off kilter frames of both foreshadowing and reminiscence (and you can't tell which is which or what is even real until the end ties them all up) the theme becomes prfoundly real and, with each frame, more obvious. The Limey is on the same mission he has been on virtually all of his life. He is not running toward something; he is running from himself, using the easily understandable motives behind the new thing he is coincidentally running toward as the newest and boldest version of an excuse.

Musings and abstractions on the wordly significance of the Limey's character in the context of his personal mission are pointless and become fairly infantile without taking this, the theme, into consideration. The ""Limey"" is not chasing after the devil to stare him in the eye and kill him; his soul has for the most part already been sold. He is chasing a false hope that the contract for his soul, already signed in his own blood on the dotted line, either does not really exist in his personal hell or can be bought back with the weak appearance of a vengeful but essentially good deed. And like every person, the irony of running away from oneself--regardless of the inner demons you're trying to escape--is that you eventually run even faster into that one and only aspect of yourself headlong.

Hell: there is no way out...but through.

The Limey has more in common with Mickey Roarke's character in ANGEL HEART than with any hero.

Terence Stamp's performance is brilliant because he makes you, like all great actors, like his character as much as he does, regardless of its above-listed failings or bad deeds. But again, that's because Stamp does such a good job at this role, not because his character, though forgiveable, is all that likeable as a person. Al Pacino did an equally great job in both THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE and SCARFACE a few years ago, but I don't see myself emulating his characters by becoming a devil-worshipping drug dealer and moving to Havana because of it. Only a child could look at THE LIMEY and call both the main character's inner pain-inspired character failings and the gradual unfolding of their obvious destructive consequences something other than what they are--and only a deeply fearful and probably formally abused child raised on too many action movies at that.

This movie is no masterpiece, but it is full of depth, with layers that bloom to reveal themselves with each passing frame. It is very good, and you will be surprised at the existential questions its simple answers ask of you, while still being entertaining.",1102118400,4,4796,4.743405275779376
1066496,5,6305741921,"When you first encounter The Limey, you may not think much of it. The edit is unconventional if you're primarily used to major studio films. It's got a loose feel to the cinematography, like most Soderbergh films.  It's not a slick, modern, hyperkinetic production. It's an episode in the midlife crisis of people who thought they'd die before they got old.
However, these things that may make it somewhat less accessible at first heighten its appeal on future viewings. Characters are introduced with a brief montage -- almost like you'd see on a TV show title sequence. The edit weaves conversations together in ways that don't seem logical at first.

The Limey isn't a film about logic or cold, hard, objective fact. It's a highly subjective retelling of the events that make up the story -- apparently from the view of Terence Stamp's character on his way home. It exists in the memories of those involved -- memories of Stamp's visit to Los Angeles to sort out the death of his daughter; memories of his past. For Peter Fonda, memories of southern California in the '60s and past glory.
This reflective memory form influences the cinematography -- things take on a sun-drenched, yellow/orange hue that is not dissimilar to your childhood memories. The soundtrack, too, calls back to days past with its music mostly coming from the 60s. (It's one of the best soundtracks in a long time).
One of the most impressive scenes is a dialog between Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren. The scene plays in many different places -- a pier, an apartment, and so forth. The scene jumps between them, and were you to take it at face value, it would make no sense. But when you remember that the whole film is just a memory, it makes complete sense.
The Limey is an innovative movie, mostly because of its unconventional approach to what would have otherwise been a flat revenge picture. You'll either be turned off immediately or strangely curious. I hope it's the latter for you -- it's a very interesting movie with great performances by all involved. It's one of my absolute essential DVDs.",1088208000,5,2077,4.766666666666667

besides the opening who song, the rest of the music is perfect when it comes up. it is haunting and slowly suspesful music that suggests its 30s and 40s era film-noir influence. the film includes peter fonda, a record company executive mogul who has connections with Los Angeles crime partners. the beatles wrote the song she said she said about peter fonda.
this is a smart film that is truly a treat for its crime genre. the music, dialogue and story are craved by true crime movie lovers everywhere. and this is about as real as the genre gets. palm trees, hollywood, the hills, record executives, guns, blood, ex cons, THE WHO.

There are definite great parts about The Limey, such as Terence Stamp and even Fonda, but I just never really go into the story.  I was convinced Stamp's character wanted revenge, but the scenes that were supposed to convince me of his love for his daughter fell flat.
Soderbergh's signature style is definitely there though.  As an early work of his, you can really see what he turned that style into later in his better works.

There's surprising little violence, I counted less than a dozen bodies, and almost all occur off-screen. Also the protagonist anti-hero, played wonderfully by Terence Stamp, appears to be a more complicated than usual character although this isn't explored as much as it could have been.

The theme is straightforward: a British ex-con arrives in LA to ""investigate"" his daughter's death. It is the manner in which he does it that the sheer class of this film pivots on. The cast, especially Terrance Stamp, are silently convincing. The action is understated, not your wham-bam if that's what you are after, and yes there IS a lot of action.

Every so often, Soderbergh likes to shake things up by doing one of these quick, down 'n' dirty indie films between big budget films.
Terence Stamp has never been better as the hard as nails Wilson. With that steely glare and fierce determination you really begin to pity anybody who crosses his path. This is a really fascinating tale of revenge and, ultimately, redemption. I would have never thought of casting Peter Fonda as the heavy but he's quite good as the morally bankrupt baddie. He's almost overshadowed by the criminally underrated Barry Newman who plays his no-nonsense right hand man. Throw in Leslie Ann Warren and the always entertaining Luis Guzman (who gets some great lines in this film -- esp. during the party scene at Fonda's house), and you've got one helluva film.
This DVD is particularly worth checking out for the rousing commentary with Soderbergh and the film's screenwriter Lem Dobbs. These guys get into quite the heated argument during the film that is quite entertaining to listen to! It's certainly something you don't hear every day.
If you're a fan of Soderbergh's films but only know him from the high profile projects like Erin Brockovich or Ocean's Eleven, then check this little gem out. They don't make crime films any better than this bad boy.",1059609600,,1519,4.823754789272031

It's a small film, with a fairly conventional plot.  What sets it apart is the stylish direction and the presence of the enigmatic Terence Stamp in the title role as a two-bit Brit criminal.  The movie tells of the death of Stamp's daughter, and his quest for revenge.  It reminded me a bit of the recent Ben Kingsley film, ""Sexy Beast.""
The story is told in a jump-cut, fragmented manner that makes it a bit confusing at times but sets it apart from similar movies.  It also features quite a few flashbacks, some of which are from one of Stamp's 1960s movies, ""Poor Cow.""  These flashbacks give the film a great deal of texture, which helps the rather generic story.  The resolution is a bit too pat, but does pack a much needed emotional wallop.

1066558,4,6305741921,"Terence Stamp is Wilson, a 'limey' ex-convict drawn to the United States in search of the truth behind his daughter's (Jenny) death.  He finishes his prison sentence only to learn the news that his daughter has died ... under less than acceptable circumstances.
Stamp plays Wilson with palpable memories of a haunted past.  It's as if pain of seeking revenge has become the only driving force in the man's life, and you can see every ounce of emotion behind every wince in his eyes.  Lesley Ann Warren winningly serves as back-up to Stamp's lead -- one of Jenny's only true friends in the facade that is crime-laden southern California.  And Luis Guzman -- long-serving supporting roles in standard television fare -- emerges brilliantly to the forefront as Jenny's former acting classmate; he accompanies Wilson on this violent journey of discovery, and he provides a sense of morality to the ex-con in a few key sequences in the film.
LIMEY's editing may not be to everyone's liking.  Dialogue is time-lapsed and out-of-sequence throughout significant portions of the film, and, similar to the manner of PULP FICTION, events don't always unfold in typical chronological fashion.  However, time is all Wilson has left in his life, and what unfolds before his eyes turns out to be almost as frightening to him as the loss of his only child.
As well, the film boasts what is probably one of the truest portraits of undercover federal drug-enforcement policy on film.
On all counts, THE LIMEY emerges as a triumphant picture about the deep dark places to which only one man bent on knowing the truth will go.",1046304000,4,1606,4.886029411764706

Unfortunately, the director overdoes it in the beginning of the film with the constant flashbacks and flashforwards to the point of agony, but then once you reach the 15 minute mark things settle down and it becomes a very watcheable and entertaining vehicle.  The visuals of the Southern California lanscape are breathtaking and make me want to travel there.  The scenes where Wilson head-butts the security guard and where he shoots up the warehouse are brilliant and hilarious because they are so understated.

The plot is simple, an aging Brit named Wilson(the Brilliant Terrence Stamp), has just been released from prison and arrives in L.A. upon hearing about is daughter's death. Everyone says that she died in a car wreck, but Wilson suspects something more sinister afoot. His investigation eventually leads him to his daughter's older boyfriend, Valentine(Peter Fonda), a sleazeball music producer who has been up to no good, and then the quest for revenge starts.
Okay, it's definately style over substance, but what style it has. With Soderbergh's masterful directing, the inventive flash-foward/flash-backward editing style, Cliff Martinez's excellent musical score, and the wonderful perfomances by Terrence Stamp, Peter Fonda, Luis Guzman, and Nicky Katt, ""The Limey"" is a masterfully constructed mystery that is a must own for any fan of the film noir genre.

1066561,5,6305741921,"Terence Stamp is not a superstar, but you would not be able to tell that from this film.  From the moment before the opening credits with a completely black screen we hear his character Wilson utter passionately, ""Tell me!  Tell me about Jenny!"" until the moment late in the film when he repeats those words, Stamp completely and utterly dominates this film.  The fact is, however, that Stamp could easily, with only a few changes in his early career, have been as big a superstar as anyone to come out of England in the past forty years.  His early selectivity in roles in the sixties, when he was one of the icons of the decade, was legendary, as was his having taken off nearly a decade to go to India to study spirituality.  As the opening credits come up, The Who's ""The Seeker"" plays, and the song could be applied as much to Stamp as to the role Stamp is playing.  (Stamp's brother, by the way, Chris Stamp, was the executive producer of many of The Who's best albums in the 1960s and early 1970s.)
The plot of the film is extremely simple:  a British con is released from prison, and travels immediately to Los Angeles to investigates his daughter's Jenny's death.  In most regards, this is a fairly average film, but two things make is a minor masterpiece.  First, this is one of the most brilliantly edited films one can ever hope to see.  It is a travesty that Sarah Flack not only didn't win an Oscar for best editing but didn't even receive a nomination.  This is one of those films where the editing tells a disproportionate amount of the story.  Not only that, but a five second straight on shot might feature two or three splices, giving the film a nervy, disorienting feel at times, to wonderful effect.
The second reason the film is elevated to something special is Stamp's portrayal of Wilson.  Stamp's voice has gotten progressively rawer over the years, and he really doesn't sound like anyone else in movies today, especially when he reverts to a Cockney accent, as he does in this one.  He radiates danger, more like the Angel of Death than a person.  I have read that Soderbergh contacted Stamp before seriously beginning work on the project, not wanting to go forward with the film until Stamp's involvement was guaranteed.  In other words, this film was built around Stamp, and it shows.  He owns this film like few actors can own a movie.  That Stamp did not receive an Oscar nomination is another absurdity.
One of the more interesting features in the film is the way that Wilson's memories of his daughter and his sense of failure as a father to her drives and motivates his behavior, sometimes in surprising and unexpected ways.  One thing that helps make this more effect is the frequently noted use of footage from a film that Stamp made in the 1960s, POOR COW.  Interestingly, POOR COW is the only other film that Stamp, an East Ender from London, has played a Cockney.  Terence Stamp is not a superstar, but this film is dramatic proof that he coulda, shoulda been, if he had wanted to be one.",1028160000,3,3027,4.55822550831793

It follows an english ex-con named Wilson (played wonderfully by Terence Stamp) and his quest for vengeance for the murder of his daughter.  Soderbergh and Dobbs' commentary on the DVD is worth the price..  they give an amazing insight into the situations and the overall editing style that makes this movie so interesting to watch.
This movie also features a very oddball but amusing cast of supporting actors like Peter Fonda, Leslie Ann Warren and Luis Guzman.
Another real interesting note about this movie is how they convinced director Ken Loach to lend them footage from an older film showing a younger Terence Stamp, to integrate with Wilson's ongoing character development.
Like modern noir-ish classics like Memento and Insomnia (the original version), The Limey is both entertaining and thought provoking and keeps the audience within it's reach.",1023062400,4,1062,5.1988304093567255
1066564,4,6305741921,"First of all, I'll say that I found the climax of the film a bit of a let-down.  Oh, it was clever, but not in a particularly believable way, it was all a bit convenient the way people kept turning up.  But never mind; the build-up was so flawless, Soderberg's direction so stylish, and the central performances so convincing, that it's really barely worth grumbling.  The editing was mainly to thank for the effective increase in tension.  Scenes from all over the time line of the story were spliced together with no explanation as to where they fit in.  This could be potentially irritating and confusing, but Soderberg proves, as he did again with Traffic, that he is fully capable of keeping track of different aspects of the same story through colour and light.  So the story flashes backwards several years and forwards several days without disrupting the narrative flow.
Peter Fonda and Luiz Guzman are both very good, but the film belongs completely to Terrence Stamp.  He keeps the audience hanging off of his every ground out word, and his face, even, or rather especially in repose has endless emotion lingering in it.  Best of all, the flashbacks are actually scenes from a film much earlier in Stamp's career, so while the young man does not particularly resemble the older one, the patterns of speech and the movements of the face are the same.  This, like The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, is a classic Terrence Stamp performance, and the film is a credit to both him and Soderberg.",1022716800,,1514,4.748091603053435

Terence Stamp plays the main character Wilson as a tough sad English criminal that is trying to find out what happened to his daughter.  His quest has genre underpinnings, but this movie rises above any genre label.  A lot of credit has to go to Lem Dobbs script which sidesteps cliche and injects some worthwhile comedy into the mix.

Right about now, I'm sounding like some chin-stroking art student hopped up on his own self-importance.  But watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.

a strict and uncompromising set of rules that govern his life, among which are the necessity to wreak vengeance on the men who killed his daughter.
Meanwhile, for Valentine and company, there are no behavioral standards, no morals to be followed; all is negotiable and nothing else matters but
your own survival.  It is a sad commentary on the state of American culture that the filmmakers felt it necessary to make Wilson so overtly alien (not
just British, which we fawningly associate with higher standards in all things, but lower-class British so that his accent and vocabulary make him
even more of a fish out of water).  When a DEA agent says to Wilson, ""You're not from around here, are you?"", he is presumably referring not just to
his national origin but also to how different he is from the laid-back Californians amongst whom he's now operating.  Wilson's savage morality is
sadly just as foreign to us as is his Cockney slang.
The other aspect of the movie that makes it particularly conservative is the way in which Peter Fonda's character references the character he played in
Easy Rider (1969).  Stamp is clearly supposed to be portraying an older version of the character he played in Poor Cow (1967), to the point where
director Soderbergh even uses film clips from that earlier role.  But not many of us will ever have seen that film.  Easy Rider, on the other hand, is a
touchstone of 60s culture and a key to understanding the era.  Fonda and Dennis Hopper are counterculture antiheroes, riding around on their
motorcycles in search of America.  Along the way they find drugs, hippies, mimes, Jack Nicholson, cops, etc.  And in the famous ending of the film
America finally catches up to them, as a pickup full of rednecks shotguns Fonda and Hopper right off of their bikes.  In many ways the finale drew a
line across the culture, and whether you rooted for the bikers or the truckers defined which side of the line you were on.  As the 1968 election and
1972 re-election of the loathsome but ""law-and-order"" Richard Nixon demonstrated to the Left's chagrin, most of us were rooting for the guys with
shotguns.
Since Fonda's character presumably died at the end of Easy Rider, he's not explicitly playing the same character in The Limey.  But it's easy to
imagine that this is what that biker (like so many of his generation) would have turned into--ammoral, self-absorbed, faux spiritual, cashing in on
both the music of the 60s (he's a record producer) and the drugs (gone is any pretense that they'll bring enlightenment; they're just easy money).  As
Fonda preens around the screen with his fake tan, his over white teeth, and his vapid young girlfriend; moving between his ostentatious LA canyon
home and his Big Sur bungalow; mouthing inanities about the meaning of the 60s; any conservative who's worth his salt will be salivating at the
prospect of watching him get whacked again.",1017619200,,3496,4.893401015228426
1066630,4,6305741921,"Terence Stamp is a very appealing actor with a presence unlike any other. The first time I ever saw him was in a 1969 Poe film directed by Fellini called ""Toby Dammit""(Spirits of the Dead). Since then I have seen him in various European films but one of his best performances was in an early eighties Stephen Frears movie The Hit where he played a gangster hiding in Spain and John Hurt was the assassin sent to find him (and a very young Tim Roth as assassins apprentice). Soderbergh's The Limey is reminiscent of that movie in that both make use of Stamps mysterious almost otherworldy nature. I like some things about The Limey like the opening number with Who playing The Seeker while Wilson(Stamps character)leaves the airport & I like Valentines(Fonda) mansion. Both these characters(and the actors that play them) are relics of the sixties and so there is a strong nostalgia thing going on. Soderbergh lays it on too thick though. The passages where we glimpse Wilson in flashback have been praised by some but I don't think the use of the old Stamp film Poor Cow adds any content to the film. It just looks like a home movie and apparently Soderbergh likes that, the look of it I fear is good enough for Soderbergh. Stamps character is looking back at a life wasted but its just so vague, those glimpses into his past are just people at parties smiling and laughing and being young. The flash forwards are kind of annoying and once again it seems style is Soderberghs motivation and his driving rationale. Stamp never becomes more than an image, a visual for the camera to play tricks with. The story is good or could have been good but the constant time shuffling and all the busy visuals prove just to distract from what we really want, some content. At the end I didn't feel like I really knew Wilson any better than I did in the beginning. Stamp remains a kind of ghost whose only interaction with the present tense is through moments of violence. Fondas character is also just a visual, never really flushed out. His characters roots are in the music business of the sixties and he attaches himself to young girls supposedly to remain eternally young. But he's also supposed to be running a major smuggling ring. His character just doesn't seem to have it in him. I think Soderbergh spent far too much time establishing a visual dossier for his characters and far too little on their actual substance. Tarantino is much better at finding a balance between striking visuals and character content. Tarantino is a writer first and a visual stylist second. Soderbergh would do better with less style and more script.",1017360000,2,2625,4.67170626349892
1066631,3,6305741921,"First things first: Without Terrence Stamp, The Limey wouldn't have really been as enjoyable. He manages to convey a sense of barely controlled rage and menace as Wilson, a small-time career theif, who has been in & out of prison since his teens. He's just been released from a 9-Year stretch (For robbing the Box-Office at a Pink Floyd concert....), and he's in L.A., looking for the man he holds responsible for the death of his Daughter (The LOVELY Melissa George, who manages to be likeable even though she has no dialogue and appears only in flashback....). Peter Fonda is likewise excellent as Terry Valentine, a sleazy, mobbed-up Record Exec.; The movie relentlessly builds to the inevetable confrontation between the two, and director Soderbergh & Writer Lem Dobbs throw in some great incidental characters along the way, played by wonderful character actors, such as Luis Guzman, Nicky Katt, and Bill Duke.
  I subtracted a few stars because I really didn't care for the ending, but the magnificent performance by Stamp, as an aging hood who spews out Cockney Rhyming-Slang, makes the film....How did he not get an Oscar for this part? Props to Soderbergh for using footage from ""Poor Cow"" as flashbacks for Stamp's character.

1066632,4,6305741921,"The Limey, a dazzling little thriller, is the kind of movie that slips through the cracks during its theatrical run. These movies tend to be not quite mainstream enough for distributors to deal with through their slick, ""one size fits all"" publicity departments. Sometimes, these smaller films do well on video, and I hope The Limey turns out to be one of them.
The Limey is in the style of the classic Hollywood thriller. It's fast-paced, full of odd characters, edited down to bare-bones essentials, and realistic only in that it fits in with a world created by and for the movies. Part of the enjoyment of this kind of film is that the viewer knows what they are seeing has little resemblance to his or her world. If this weren't so, then what we see would hit too close to home and would make us squirm.
The lead character, Wilson, is played by veteran British actor Terence Stamp, who started out 1960s as a sex symbol who could act. Stamp seems to have had little interest in commercial roles. As time went on, he became a character actor, and it's great to see him once more with a big role. Wilson is a professional thief who has just been released from an English prison, where he spent a number of years. His incarceration caused him to miss seeing his daughter grow up. He is distraught when he learns the young woman has been killed in an automobile accident in Los Angeles. Perhaps out of guilt, he flies to California. Once there, he quickly learns that there are a lot of unanswered questions about the accident. He becomes suspicious and tries to learn more about Valentine, her mysterious boyfriend. The more the truth is hidden from him, the more he is willing to use any method, including violence, to find it.
There are some drawbacks to the storyline, but they are ones typical of the genre. In particular, the body count is absurdly high. In real life, there would be police detectives and SWAT teams everywhere. The Drug Enforcement Agency is, as usual, portrayed as a group of guys whose morals are no better than the criminals they pursue. On the plus side, the characterizations are well defined, and the events that motivate the characters are clear and fairly logical.
The movie poses some interesting questions. How far should you go in avenging the death of a child? Would your anger be increased if you were guilt-ridden because you were never there for her? Does revenge ever bring satisfaction? Above all, though, this is a thriller. It is almost all action, but, because of the questions it poses and its intriguing plot, The Limey proves entertaining to more than just hard-core action fans.",1016496000,3,2626,4.673866090712743
1066633,5,6305741921,"Steven Soderbergh is known as an director to whom everythings counts. He  always keeps up with the details. He uses many tecnical resourses in lightning, editing, in the score and the most from actors in order to achieve a higher level from all his movies .Actors like George Clooney --`Out of Sight' and `Ocean's Eleven'  -- and Julia Roberts  -- `Erin Brockovich' and `Ocean's Eleven'-- have done their best job with him. But in `The Limey' he has gone one step further what he'd done before. Not only does he get amazing peformances from Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda, but he also makes of editing and lightning real characters in this film.
Telling the story of a father, Wilson, who wants to revenge the mysterious death of his daughter and comes accross a music producer, who is the girl's ex-boyfriend, sounds rather like an excuse for Soderbergh  experiment in collors and cuts -- something that he used very often in his previous works and he would eventually use much more in the later movie `Traffic'. Moreover, he uses footage from the 1967 film `Poor Cow',  which also feautured Stamp. It is at least strange to imagine that something shot 30 years earlier would be useful and fitting. I think only Soderbergh's genius mind would think of such a thing. And the result is much better than any make or computer work.
Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda --two icons of the `60s -- are at least impressive playing the main roles. Their `confrontation' is breath taking. The supporting cast also very effective. Luiz Guzmn -- a Soderbergh 's favourite -- and Lesley Ann Warren play former friends of  Wilson's daugther.
Lem Dobbs `s script along with the direction make the film very French New Wave, but with a touch of the thrillers from the `60s and `70s, like `Point Blank'. The soudtrack also fits the movie. Pay attention to the song played in the opening credits: The Who's ""The Seeker""; there couldn't be a music more perfect for Wilson.
Definetely this quiet character-driven movie is not for everyone. People who know Soderbergh's work only from crowd-pleaser like `Erin Brockovich' may feel very uncorfortable watching this movie. But, by the way, this IS a film to make everybody unconfortable: it tackles moral issues, like revenge and guilt. That, as everybody knows, are not pieces of cake.",1014768000,4,2307,4.842639593908629
1066634,1,6305741921,"First of all, I should describe the circumstances surrounding my purchase of this DVD. As a big fan of ""Out Of Sight"", and having read top-notch reviews of ""The Limey,"" it seemed like a great addition to my shopping basket, to spread the shipping costs a little thinner. Don't fall into the same trap I did! Watch this film before you buy the DVD. You might be surprised.
Terence Stamp stars as Wilson, a cockney ex-con who travels to LA to discover the truth behind his daughter's death. In true ""Columbo"" style, he quickly realised that Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda), his daughter's boyfriend, holds the answers. Stylistically, this is an interesting movie. The trademark Soderbergh non-linearity is present, to great effect, and Luis Guzman turns in a typically high quality performance as Wilson's sidekick. A spooky score combines to give the movie a slightly disturbing quality that should make it a moody, stylish film.
However, when will Soderbergh understand that just because someone has a cockney accent doesn't mean that they have to rattle off rhyming slang all the time? He patronises his fellow Americans terribly by having Wilson translate every phrase for the audience. It's enough that Stamp uses a palpable London accent and obvious colloquialisms throughout the film, and that Guzman constantly comments that Wilson's drawl as unintelligible. Need we endure further embarrassment? As an Englishman myself, I can say that I have rarely seen a less convincing portrayal of one of my fellow countrymen, other than possibly Vinnie Jones's character in ""Swordfish"".
Further, an example of the script's flaws is that Wilson uses the phrase ""you wrote me"" on several occasions. An Englishman would say, ""you wrote TO me"". Is Wilson is catering for the Americans with whom he is conversing, (in which case wouldn't he also realise that they wouldn't understand rhyming slang)? Or is he exhibiting his character as a flawed and inconsistent one? Another point is that he talks so slowly (why?) that he sounds as if he suffered a 90% lobotomy whilst at ""Her Majesty's pleasure""!
Rule One:
Cockney slang is an eccentric tradition, and charming in its own way, but if it needs explaining in as much depth as Soderbergh does here then it's not worth inclusion.
Rule Two:
Hire a leading man who can act.
Rule Three:
Hire some continuity staff that have some idea about dialectic issues across the globe.
Unfortunately it looks like Soderbergh will fall into the same traps time and again, as is exhibited by the recent ""Ocean's Eleven"". Not content with having Don Cheadle among the cast, one of the coolest actors working today, he makes him English too. Thankfully Cheadle only explains his rhyming slang once, or I might have walked out of the theatre!
Also unfortunately the story is incredibly boring. If this was a vanity project, then may I recommend that all mirrors in the near vicinity of the director's trailer be removed on future films?

He kills people, but shows restraint and disernment.  He also manages to keep from being caught.  The surround sound was powerful in its minimalism.  It was not overused, so when the subwoofer kicks in at particularly violent moments, you can really feel it.  There are some good music tracks that surround nicely.  The movie, in the end, has that rainy-day ""so this is how it is"" feel to it.  Like I said, it is worth watching at least once.  Not worth buying, in my opinion",1013472000,,809,4.659574468085107

We witnessed films like Run Lola Run, The Blair Witch Project, The Matrix, and other films what we would have considered strange back in '99.

Which, in my opinion, was one of the most entertaining movies that I had ever had the pleasure upon viewing. The film is weird, funny, thrilling, bold, and brilliant. One of the reasons I loved this film so much was simply because of Terrence Stamps performance as Wilson. His performance was riveting, captivating, and just down-right mesmerizing. Lets face it, I don't think anybody in the film industry has a stare as eerie as his. In this film his stare alone can send you chills. Peter Fonda's performance as Terry Valentine is so well casted, you can almost smell his cowardness. Who could have selected a better director for the film than Steven Soderbergh? He is what made this film so professional. I love the way he pulls his magic tricks with the camera, on this movie. He also did a great job selecting wonderful music from the 60s as well. In my opinion, its Soderberghs best film. Personally, I didn't very much care for Traffic. It was far too overated for my liking. Anyway, you cant beat ''The Limey''.

By the time the end came around, I really didn't *care* whether ""'e dun it"" or not.  In fact, by the second-half, I was forwarding through some of the inane conversations (thank goodness for DVD!).
On the LONG drive up the beautiful highway, on the way to kill someone, do we really want to hear a long drawn out conversation about whether Wilson has any friends?  Does it really matter?  Does it tell us anything about him that the past hour of similarly inane conversations haven't already brutally driven home?

Peter Fonda parodies his image quite effectively, and Luis Guzman (one of Soderbergh's house players) excels in his small role.  But the movie is all about Stamp.  I read an interview with Soderbergh in which he said that he didn't need special effects because he had the best special effect ever invented: ""Terrence Stamp's eyes.""  A great line, and 100% dead-on correct.  On the larger screen, Stamp's eyes almost burn a hole through you.
'Bowfinger' came out around the same time as 'The Limey,' and it features Stamp as the leader of a Scientology-like cult called 'Mindhead' (which Steve Martin's character humorously refers to in the film as 'Mindfffff...head').  Put these two roles together - along with his classic portrayal of a transsexual in 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert' - and what emerges is the picture of an actor with amazing range.

But the warehouse scene has got be one of the best parts of the film, where the audience had almost felt his bruises and cuts, and cheered him on to vengeance. It's also humourous in places: his East End accent and way with words confuses the American populace somewhat! Although I very much enjoyed the character, plot and action sequences of this film, it just doesn't quite rate five stars for some reason. Wilson's memories of Jenny are actually part of the story idea behind this film. Who is really to blame? And who has the right to exact vengeance? I'm really glad I hired this film out, to view it twice at least. Be warned: Wilson's coming! A superb Anglo-American drama thriller.",972345600,2,1770,4.65814696485623

Although it wasn't exactly what I had expected, the outcome was refreshing and stylish enough to make me want to see more of Soderburgh's movies.  Terrence Stamp, whose acting in the '65 thriller ""The Collector"" amazed me, was perfect as an ex-con just out of prison looking for the truth behind his daughter's death.  The monotonous but somehow intriguing main theme also enhanced the way this movie turned out; completely Soderburgh style(very stylish).  The only thing I would have to say bad about this movie is the storyline which seemed too simple to me, but the acting and cinematography( one word: flashbacks) gave it enough depth to cover it all.  A must-see for anyone who is looking for a slick, visually stunning movie that doesn't rely on special effects to create (subtle) tension and drama.",969753600,2,899,4.966666666666667

The non-linear story telling and  slightly offset editing created an unsettling (but not uncomfortable)  atmosphere.  You aren't always sure that what you think you understand is  true.  That seemed a really appropriate way to tell this story.  On it's  face, it seems to be a simple case of a father's quest to avenge his  daughters death...but is it so simple?

1066757,4,6305741921,"In fact, substance, as always in Steven Soderbergh's movies, is slightly  disappearing behind the style of this american director. But, if you are  careful enough, you can find in THE LIMEY some food for your movie lover's  mind. Other viewers will be annoyed by the non-linear story, in time and  space, that becomes the trademark of director Soderbergh. If I can dare a  literary comparison, Soderbergh is the William Faulkner of today american  cinema.
Now comes the problem. To master the cinematographic grammar, to  play with flashbacks, unconventional story tellings does that make you an  important author-director ? I should say no and I sincerely hope that  Steven Soderbergh will not have a -  la Godard- career, lost in a  cinematographical dead end. Because the danger of a pure style-for-style  effort is very close.
Anyway, I liked THE LIMEY which could be compared  to a classic sonata. Two instruments, Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda, two  musical recurrent themes haunting the desperate search, in time and space,  of Terence Stamp. One could read THE LIMEY as a huge metaphor of the  english-american musical battle for supremacy that began with the arrival  of the Beatles on U.S. ground.
So the intellectual pleasure is here but  you will scarcely find in THE LIMEY something that will move your heart.  It's a desperately cold movie that rejects you in the back of your seat,  alone with your thoughts. And I sincerely think that a masterpiece must  touch your mind AND your heart.

1066758,4,6305741921,"The opening line, voiced over a black screen, ""Tell me about Jenny!"" sets the tone for this tightly constructed psychological drama/thriller about a father's quest to find out what really happened on the night his daughter died, alegedly in a car accident, in Los Angeles.
Terrence Stamp's performance as Wilson, the recently released career criminal, is a fascinating character.  While he is determined to commit further crimes to find out what really happened to his daughter to whom he was, ""like a ghost in her life,""  over the course of the film we learn the nature of Wilson's past crimes and come to respect that he is operating out of love for a child he barely knew and not out of sheer malice.  The mystery is set in motion when Wilson recieves a letter from a casual friend of his daughter's, Ed, who sends a clipping on her death because he, ""just thought soemone should know.""  Ed, an ex-con himself, isn't convinced that Jenny's death wasn't an accident but felt the father should be notified.  Throughout, there are character studies of noble men and women who by act of circumstance are believed by society to be evil.  Ed leads Wilson to a record producer named Valentine with whom Jenny was involved, romantically we think but it's never quite directly stated, at the time of her death.
The psychology of this film is fascinating.  What is good or evil, when does an act become criminal? (There's an awesome exchange of information between Wilson and the DEA who are already watching Valentine.) It's possible that Jenny was looking for a father she didn't have when she fell in with Valentine's crowd.  She may also have been looking for a noble man with an bad streak when she became romantically involved with Valentine.  Ultimately, we're left with a fundamental question of who is really responsible for Jenny's death.  Wilson may come to regret his quest because he didn't find an answer with which he's comfortable.
Non-linear movies are nothing new and in less skilled hands than Soderbergh they often become confusing.  But in this case, each flashback effectively embellishes plot elements we've already known or gives a bit of information we need to know in a future scene without over foreshadowing and making the outcome obvious.  A lot like ""Sex, Lies and Videotape,"" Soderbergh's masterpiece in my opinion, this a a tightly crafted story about somewhat disturbed people doing very disturbing things, but almost always for very good reasons.",967507200,,2473,4.918269230769231
1066759,4,6305741921,"The inevitable outcry of critics has finally touched director Steven Soderbergh.  He started his career with the indie cult favorite, Sex, Lies  and Videotape, but recently went on to commercial success with 1998's Out  of Sight and his highest budget picture to date, Erin Brockovich, starring  Julia Roberts.  Gus Van Sant and Sam Raimi recently went through a similar  transformations with their big budget releases; artists who start with  strong personal visions in their films and move on to higher budget and  ""name star"" casting unavoidably become critically marginalized, for better  or worse, when they move away from arthouse fare and to (hopefully)  profitable mainstream cinema.  In The Limey, Soderbergh proves that despite  his move towards matinee filmmaking he retains integrity in his work and an  exceptional sense of style.
Terence Stamp plays a career criminal who  comes to Los Angeles to examine his daughter Jenny's death.  It is his  attempt to make sense of her passing and come to terms with the nature of  her life that was lived hidden from him.  Reminding me of The Sweet  Hereafter, it could be a companion piece to that film's undercurrent of a  parent dealing with his daughter's drug addiction and eventual death.  In  it, Ian Holm plays a lawyer who descends upon a small town offering his  services in the wake of a tragic school bus accident.  What Hereafter does  though is open up the multi-faceted nature of the man and documents his  dealings with his junkie progeny.  His own failings as a parent mingled  with desperate attempts to help her and disappointment in the weakness of  her will.
Stamp's character shows that kind of introspection, but also  the quiet strength and purpose of the legendary bad*ss.  Released from  prison shortly before Jenny's death he arrives with newspaper clippings of  the event and the name of the man who sent them to him.  That man turns out  to be a friend of Jenny's named Eddie (played by the inimitable Soderbergh  favorite Luis Guzmn) who she went to acting class with.  An appropriate  connection for disparate individuals living in L.A., including Jenny's  record mogul boyfriend, Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda), and her older friend  Elaine, a voice coach.
Speaking of disparate, the soundtrack is a fine  amalgam of British rock and eerie compositions that mold to the atmosphere  of the story precisely.  The theme music is like two notes next to each  other being played back and forth, but bent in pitch, bringing to mind the  sound of a sonar display on a submarine.  It subtly matches the ebb and  flow of this brooding and moody film.
The Limey is a rewarding film of  multiple layers, but Soderbergh does use flashback and time play to a point  that is maddening, the effect of using abstruse visual landmarks make it  appear like the filmmaker intends to insure that you see the film more than  once, just to understand all of it (not that a second viewing wouldn't be  worthwhile).  And you can't blame him considering the film is quite  conventional without the style - it serves to juxtapose the ideas of  narrative and deconstruct them by hearing a voiceover conversation while  staring at blank faces and blending multiple conversations into one stream  of congruence.  It is a hyperstyle cousin to his work in Out of Sight and  if he chooses to pursue this visuospatial design further I don't think it  will be worth watching.",966556800,4,3425,4.905263157894737
1066760,4,6305741921,"THe Movie: Like most of the review-posters here, I completely enjoyed the  film. While it is not breaking any new storytelling, its mind bending time  altering editing is a PRUE JOY. There are nice moments, for example, when  Stamp confuses valet's for hired muscle, and a beautiful (and undoubtly  very true) statement from Peter Fonda about what the 60's really boiled  down to. Wonderful acting from all, and an ending that I will not soon  forget, this is a little gem from a great director.
The Extra's: The  featurette is nice and the production spots are nice as well. THe 60's Star  commentary is mostly enjoyable, although a little disjointed. The gem here  is the commentary with Soderbergh and Lew Dobbs. Not only is Dobbs an angry  screenwriter (he points out the difference between his written vision of  character developement and Soderbergh's direction) but a talented one as  well (describing the ""shootout"" scene, and explaining how close  the film was to the written word). They appear to get along, but there is a  touch of underlying tension. The coolest (or weirdist thing) is the  ""psychadelic"" sound edits. Echo fades, overdubbs, I can't quite  decide if they are being ""cute"" or just kinda matching the mood  of the disk.
My only complaint about the disk that everytime you go from  the menu to the film, even if you are in the middle of the flick, you have  to deal with the 6-8 second ""intro"" before you get back to the  movie.

  That's  the surface of the film, but there is another layer here that turned  standard thriller material into sublime art house fare.

The film is finally all about  memories, and its climax is an epiphany of memory and of the strange  patterns that we fall into in our lives.

 ""The Limey"" takes a  circuitous approach to the phenomenon of women falling for men like their  fathers and bringing their father-daughter baggage along with them.  What  trouble these relationships are the specific emotional patterns and games  people play, which are worked out in great detail between child and parent  very early in life.

1066837,4,6305741921,"A pleasant film that garners attention for all of the right reasons, ""The Limey"" is a stylish movie that relies on story-telling more than plot to make an enjoyable experience. Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda  play wonderfully flawed characters that have more in common than they would  like to admit. They spend the movie in a game of  ""hunter-and-hunted,"" unwilling to see that they each perpetuate  the other's violence with every move they make.
While Stamp and Fonda  are brilliant, the true ingenuity behind this film is in the directing and  editing. Steven Soderbergh relies heavily on pastiche and montage as a  means of creating a cohesive world for his characters. Using scenes from  the 1960's film ""Poor Cow"" to develop a history for Wilson  (Stamp) is highly successful in producing a believable character with an  intelligible past. It is this type of depth and attention to detail that  helps Soderbergh to keep his actors from becoming mere caricatures of  themselves. The fractured editing by Sarah Flack is beautiful and  well-done, serving to deepen an exceedingly simple story. Certain scenes  and moments have a tendency to reappear and reverbrate off of each other.
The only thing that could have improved this film - and elevated it to 5  stars - would have been a bit more attention to an interesting storyline.  With a touch of complexity, this movie could have been a true classic,  rather than just a character study. It was refreshing, however, to watch  this intelligent movie take stock of criminality and the psyches of those  that succumb to and perpetuate its lifestyle.",964310400,4,1602,4.977358490566037

The plot is of a man released from prison who wants answers  from a multi-millionaire music producer regarding the truth behind his  daughter's suspicious death.

1066899,4,6305741921,"Terrence Stamp has had an interesting career, with smaller roles in big films like ""Superman"", ""Bowfinger"", and Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace""; as well as larger roles in small  films, like ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert""  and Steven Soderbergh's latest film, ""The Limey"". Actually,  ""The Limey"" is somewhat of a spin-off from one of Stamp's earlier  films--""Poor Cow"", a British 1967 film directed by Kenneth Loach.  In ""The Limey"", it takes the minor character which Stamp played  in ""Poor Cow""--a thief with a wife and daughter who gets sent to  jail--and sets the story as he gets out.
 It opens with a black screen,  with a single voiceover of Stamp interrogating someone: ""Tell me about  Jenny. Tell me about Jenny!"" Jenny, as it turns out, is his daughter,  and has died in a rather suspicious manner. What follows would otherwise be  a bland story of a father's vengeance; however, thanks to Soderbergh's  precise and inventive direction, [and Stamp's acting,] it turns out to be a  taut and intriguing thriller. Peter Fonda is an excellent counterpart to  Stamp, as the slimy, over-the-hill record producer who is suspected of  being a part of narcotics ring and of killing Stamp's daughter.
  Soderbergh is known to fool around with the linear timeline a bit, as he  did in the critically acclaimed ""Out of Sight"". (OK, nearly all  of Soderbergh's movies are critically acclaimed.) However, one interesting  effect that Soderbergh uses in ""The Limey"" is, at first, we  witness a conversation. In the middle of the conversation, while the  conversation continues, we watch a different point of the conversation, and  then a freeze frame of the listener's face. It's a very effective means of  emphasizing the emotion of the two involved in the conversation, while  keeping the story moving. This effect takes some time to get used to, but  once you adjust, you enjoy the ride. Soderbergh also uses fantasy scenes,  to emphasize Stamp's emotions, which allows the viewer to empathize with  Stamp's character. This is essential, because one needs to make a  fundamental connection with the protagonist in order to like a story of an  ex-con ready to brutalize someone.
 Soderbergh's direction and Stamp's  acting make a fine duo. ""The Limey"" picks up in Soderbergh's  masterful direction skills where ""Out of Sight"" left off.  Definitely worth a watch. Four stars.",958521600,7,2401,5.053708439897698
1066900,1,6305741921,"This film is a classic example of a director peddling garbage and knowing that semi-intelligent people will see it as their obligation to love it.  Like the painter who throws ink spots on a canvas, Sonderbergh hides his  ineptitude behind incoherant styling.  He must know that there are many low  IQs who will rave simply to stroke their own egos.  The morons who loved  this film could not even begin to explain it and anyone who likes  interesting movies will not even be able to sit through it all.  A very  detached, unemotional and uninteresting film.  One that assumes the  audience will pay to see a 2 hour MTV video (or high school student film)  rather than a professionally made movie.",957139200,3,697,4.669421487603306
1066901,5,6305741921,"This movie took me by complete surprise. I didn't know what to think of it. Some of my friends said it was kind of a mystery, the box says thriller, and I ended up believing it was a dream. Why a Dream? Because  everything was out of order, time passes without you really paying  attention and when its over, you're not sure if it was real or not. Not  real in the fact that its a movie and its fiction, but real in the sense  that it was so GOOD. The performances are amazing, the sense of loss, sense  of hopelessness, sense of accomplishment, these things are all portrayed in  the film excellently. I was taken paticularly by the Terrence Stamp  flashbacks of him in his earlier years. The last scene is a beautiful  ending, if somewhat tragic, or hopeful. I can't decide. You can decide for  yourself whether this ""dream"" by the quirky mind of Steven  Soderbergh is beautiful, or tragic.",957052800,,892,4.450617283950617
1066902,5,6305741921,"Terence Stamp plays Wilson, a career criminal who arrives in Los Angeles from London to find the man responsible for the death of his daughter. ""The Limey"" is a sensitive and mature character study  masquerading as an action thriller. It's an incisive examination of a  lonely man's sense of time wasted and a life squandered. The photography  and editing are superb, the acting is uniformly first class, and the script  is excellent. Having been underwhelmed by director Soderbergh's previous  movies, I hesitated before seeing this one. Don't follow my example.",957052800,,563,5.211111111111111
1066903,4,6305741921,"This is a good solid drama with some strong performances.  Wilson (Terence Stamp) is an ex-con who just got out of prison and is looking for answers regarding the death of his estranged daughter in a car crash.  He suspects  foul play and he is certain that her ex-boyfriend, music magnate Terry  Valentine (Peter Fonda) is behind it.  So he undertakes to seek the truth  with vengeance in his heart, leaving a good deal of carnage in his wake  along the way.
The story itself is an interesting human drama including a  number of character studies.  The drama worked, but the character studies  of Wilson, and his daughter Jenny were unsatisfying even though a  significant amount of time was devoted to them.  The most important  character study, that of Wilson himself, leaves us with more questions than  answers.
Unfortunately, this film is an example of style overwhelming  substance.  Director Steven Soderbergh has created an icon of visual style  that is so prominent that it overshadowed and pushed the story into the  background.  In reality, based upon the amount of dialogue and the number  of meaningful scenes, this story probably could have been told in 45  minutes.  But through the magic of multiple perspectives and redundancies  on every scene, Soderbergh managed to double that.
Soderbergh's visual  interpretation was nothing short of brilliant.  It was creative genius at  work to be sure.  Veteran cinematographer Edward Lachman must be commended  as well. The use of angles, lighting, filters, music, and breathtaking  locations near the ocean were all superlative; but those endless cutaways  eventually made me want to throw myself from Valentine's swimming pool  overlook.  Incessantly, sometimes every two or three seconds, he would  layer cutaway upon cutaway in a dizzying array of perspectives on the same  scene.  It is a terrific technique when used to dramatize a point, and  Soderbergh is masterfully creative in its use.  But to assemble a feature  length motion picture from a patchwork of cutaways flitting back and forth  through time with constant disruptions in continuity was like eating  nothing but your favorite flavor of ice cream as your every meal for a  month.  There comes a point where too much of a wonderful thing becomes  distasteful.  It made it seem like Soderbergh was in desperate need of a  little Ritalin during post production.  (Which is why this film will  probably be the delight of the Attention Deficit Generation.)
Terence  Stamp gave a strong performance as the tough and enigmatic Wilson.  Stamp  is an old pro and gives the character power and determination.  Peter  Fonda's renaissance continues with another fine portrayal.  Oddly, this may  be the first time I remember him smiling so much.  He has played so many  dour characters, it almost looked strange to see him grin.  Lesley Ann  Warren added very little in her role as Elaine, a friend and instructor of  Wilson's daughter.
I was very impressed with the work of Nicky Katt, who  played Stacey.  He was a very cavalier, yet charismatic villain with a  wryly philosophical bent that made him both sinister and funny.  I'm  looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future.
This was an  smartly told story that sputtered a bit at the end, but in balance was  first rate.  It was fabulously filmed from a technical standpoint, but it  became a bit too self indulgent.  It forgot that the purpose of outstanding  filmmaking technique is to enhance the story, not simply to show off.  I  rated it a 8/10.  It is worth seeing just for its merit as an illustration  of the art form.  If you can survive all the cutaways without sustaining  cortical whiplash, you will probably enjoy the excellent story that lies  within.",956534400,,3752,4.948220064724919
1066904,4,6305741921,"The Limey was one of the best of 99'.  This movie just goes to show that a short movie can also have all the action and drama of those long Oscar nominated flicks.  Terrence Stamp plays an excellent performance as a gritty, incomprehensible man wanting revenge.  I love the way the movie  goes back and forth in time to show all the emotions and happenings of the  characters.  The way the light plays on him in the plane, the way his  daughter is always filmed in this haze.  You have to rent it to find out.",956361600,,509,4.229166666666667

First off let me say, I'm not really a big fan of Soderbergh(mainly because of ""Out of Sight""), but after watching this movie, I had a different  perspective.  The movie is good and Soderbergh is effective in using a  series of flashbacks/flashforwards,  to tell the story and thoughts of  Terrance Stamp.  The audio/video is good and there is enough extra material  to keep you happy.  If you're a fan of Soderbergh or Stamp, you can't go  wrong with this DVD.

Sound a bit dull? Then  simply enjoy it as a gangster drama played out in sunny California. The  director doesn't waste a moment, it's imaginatively shot, the music is  great and you'll want to talk about it and then see it again. Criminally  neglected by the pundits and multiplexes, I hope this disc sells in spades.  The director/writer commentary is a scream.

The acting was bad, It proves anyone can read a line and stand  around trying to look like they are in deep thought. The Dialog is boaring  and trying at times. I would expect more from a high school film student.  Half the film is rehashing flashbacks and flashforwards. The charicters are  boaring and lifeless. The only interesting person in the movie is the 2-bit  poolhall killer, and he wasn't that interesting. In the end I'd like to say  I had very little feeling for any of the people or what they were doing.  Fonda and Stamp couldn't carry this film because they both can't act. I'd  give this a -5 stars but Amazon has no - (minus) rating.",955238400,7,805,4.32
1066964,5,6305741921,"I debated over whether or not to give this movie four or five stars-- it seems to me that 5 stars is an overused rating, but I so enjoyed it that in the end I couldn't give it anything but.  Now, I must warn that this movie  is not for everyone.  If non-linear stories confuse you, just forget it,  you'll hate ""The Limey.""  It's totally out of order, and the plot  is simplistic anyway.  But this movie isn't so much telling you a story as  it is telling you about the characters.  Which is why I would recommend it  if you, like me, enjoy character studies.  ""The Limey"" is *not*  an action film, it's a character study of a career criminal who will soon  be too old to keep up with his lifestyle.  And my God, the performances,  particularly by Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda are absolutely incredible.  Of course, the movie rests on Stamp's performance, being the focus of the  film, and he delivers in spades.  But not to be overlooked is Fonda, who as  something of a doppleganger to Stamp's character, Wilson, is every bit  Stamp's equal.  Steven Soderbergh's direction is unsurprisingly excellent.  Altogether another great movie of 1999.",954892800,64,1145,4.592039800995025

It's apt due to the nature of the story and the nature of the leads: two sixties icons in  real life who play aging countercultural types who took different paths. It  is very reminiscent of Point Blank. Some would say that it is a ripoff, but  I don't care. More movies ought to take their cues from Point  Blank.
Normally, I don't like gimmickry and devices in movies and books,  but it was not for naught in the Limey.
The entire cast delivers an  excellent performance. Stamp is magnetic in his combination of Britishness  and brutishness. The minor hoods are amusing. The climax is exciting, too.  Soderberg and cinematography were well deployed to create excitement and  tension.",954720000,3,809,4.846715328467154

I can sum the whole plot up in a few words:  cockney  career criminal attempts to make good on bad parentage by killing all the  bad guys in his dead daughter's past.  The flashbacks are artsy and  overdone, and the story is mindless.

He alone is worth the rent (Christ, the scene where he pays the guys in the warehouse a second visit  is worth the rent, classic).  He's flawlessly entertaining.  This film also  had the best editing.  Amazing how Soderbergh spliced so many scenes  together with dialogue from various scenes in the movie going back and  forth, and it all made perfect sense.  I especially loved how throughout  the movie, you assume the shot of him on the plane is from his ride to  America, but then you find that it's him on the plane home, recollecting  his vacation (hope I'm not ruining this for anyone).  This film reminded me  a great deal of John Boorman's Point Blank.  Both are films about men on  missions of revenge, thinking of nothing else.  Both had some hilariously  violent scenes.  Both were nearly overlooked completely.  And like Point  Blank, to understand the ending, you're going to have to figure out what's  going through our heroes head.",954115200,7,1066,4.853932584269663

Movies like this exist to restore your faith in the cinematic process  as a whole. The Limey is a big slice of cheesecake to wash down the  horrible choking slime of movies like ""Payback""
Also worth  acquiring due to the commentaries, the first being a prolonged, amusing and  mixed up argument between soderbergh (god) and lem dobbs (satan) and the  second being everyone else.
