7309155,3,B010DX8AM8,"The animation in this short film is absolutely top-of-the-line and pays brilliant attention to the cherished Christmas specials of days gone by. However, most of the most charming moments of the original film are gone, with new bits added. The music, while very well written and in the style of the old Christmas classics falls a bit short for one main reason - they don't sing any recognizable Christmas music as they do in the film. While the final song may...if it's very lucky...become recognizable, the rest of the score is full of great lyrics but absent of any Christmas type feel. The cast is great - Ed Asner really has a fantastic narrative voice (as good as Burl Ives) and Jim Parsons is cute as Buddy.

It was a great effort and I spent most of my time in awe over the animation/claymation detail, but utimately, it doesn't find a steady beat. My husband sort of wanted to shoot himself while watching it out of sheer boredom. He enjoyed the Behind the Scenes footage far better than the film. The story feels rushed and that may be part of the problem. In 44 minutes and this many songs, you can make something cute and pretty to look at but nothing with the kind of emotional impact those old stories had on kids. It feels neutered - afraid of the edginess of the original film - and visual/music driven rather than story driven.",1449446400,8,1343,4.526748971193416
7309156,5,B010DX8AM8,"We had some rough weather on our latest Thanksgiving camping trip so we spent an entire day watching movies and playing games. With five people and two dogs stuck inside a trailer, a new holiday movie was exactly what we needed to lift everyone's spirits and most importantly, be good enough to hold the attention of the entire family!

Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas  is a claymation movie which in my opinion makes it a front runner to become a family holiday classic. It's based on the popular Elf movie and the musical.

Buddy is a bit of a goof ball and a screw up and I think that's exactly the kind of star we need! It's important to teach our kids that no one is perfect and even the seemingly screwy can be successful if they are determined!

Buddy learns the harsh truth about his real roots this Christmas and sets out to find his roots in New York City. Unfortunately, his dream of a perfect reunion with his dad isn't to be. But he has a spectacular journey and learns lots of lessons along the way. More importantly, he teaches them to those that need a little reminder of the true meaning of Christmas!

I loved Buddy's quirky character. He had me laughing out loud along with the rest of the family. The rest of the cast was incredible. I especially loved the appearance of Jay Leno! Of course there had to be bad guys, good guys, and friendships made.

This movie is heartwarming and entertaining and I knew Elf was a hit when my kids asked to watch it again back to back!

If you are looking for a new family holiday movie, Elf is great for people of all ages. You will laugh with Buddy, maybe a little at him, and cheer him on in his Christmas endeavors.",1448668800,3,1673,4.360128617363344

7309170,3,B010DX8AM8,I saw that another review had my experience. The disc appears to be fine and my kids really enjoy the movie but I was really disappointed in the condition in which the DVD case arrived. The case is not the typical DVD case and is very flimsy. It was crushed inside the sealed plastic although somehow the disc looks fine. I'll have to find a new case for it.,1481068800,,358,4.202898550724638

7309190,3,B010DX8AM8,"Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas is basically an abridged (about 38 minutes) version of the Will Ferrell movie's storyline (Elf) but this time round done with stop go animation that resembles the old Christmas TV movies like Rudolph, although this is more modern looking. Jim Parsons plays the title character, although he's pretty much Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory. Not really sure if Parsons can play anyone else, I like the Sheldon character but don't need him to be in everything else Jim Parsons is in, surely he's got it in him to play someone different. It's interesting in the special feature Elf-in All the Way, the director or someone says Jim tried a voice and the first one nailed it, that was Buddy, when he's doing Sheldon. There's other big names in the cast too, such as Mark Hamill who plays the dad and thankfully knows how to do a non Skywalker voice. Kate Micucci (minor multiple guest roles Scrubs, Big Bang Theory) plays Jovie a hot chick Sheldon falls for. There's also very brief roles by Jay Leno, Matt Lauer.

Basically what lets this down as being a stand alone movie is that it views like a clip show of a longer movie and jumps too quickly in between moments, such as Sheldon's dad (sorry Buddy's dad it's hard to differentiate) is a bad guy on the naughty list for fifty years or something and acts like it, then Buddy mentions the name of a woman the dad slept with and he is suddenly a nice guy. Likewise he has a very understanding wife (who kind of looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) who doesn't care at all that he has fathered another child and immediately accepts the situation of Buddy living with them. Buddy gets run over by quite a few cars which might send the wrong message that it's survivable to young viewers. The songs are terrible, the film has the words Musical Christmas in the title so I knew there would be singing, I didn't know the songs would be terrible, not catchy or even that musical.",1451692800,,1943,4.535612535612535
7309191,4,B010DX8AM8,"Very cute version of Elf that should hold the attention of children. I plan on falling more in love with this once I've watched it a few more times.
