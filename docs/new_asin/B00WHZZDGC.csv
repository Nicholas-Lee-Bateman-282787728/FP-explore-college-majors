7132542,3,B00WHZZDGC,"This is a bare bones release. Why wasn't the entire Roxy September 25, 2014 performance presented on this Blu-Ray disc?
The fact that four songs were featured as bonus tracks instead of as part of the main show is perplexing.
Perhaps, this is because there are no behind the scenes extras included.
Here is the complete setlist for the Roxy 09.25.14 show.

  Ghost
  Nightrain
  Halo
  Back from Cali
  Stone Blind
  You Could Be Mine
  Doctor Alibi
  You're Crazy
  Wicked Stone
  30 Years to Life
  Rocket Queen
  Bent to Fly
  Starlight
  You're a Lie
  Automatic Overdrive
  World on Fire
  Anastasia
  Sweet Child O' Mine
  Slither
  Paradise City

If you can only buy the BD/DVD or 2CD set, I'd go for the compact disc release as it is a more complete edition (only Automatic Overdrive is missing).

I wouldn't be surprised if there is a special edition of Live At The Roxy 09.25.14 Blu-Ray disc released down the road that features the entire concert and the Raised On The Sunset Strip - Slash documentary, as Eagle Rock has a history of re-releasing content.",1434585600,11,1066,4.657458563535911

7132551,5,B00WHZZDGC,"Great Live DVD.  Just to watch these guys work is amazing.  Masters of their art, and Slash is actually getting better with age, if that is possible.  Camera work is great, sound is superb.  Given that these guys can and do play anywhere in the world, It's really cool to see Slash play at one of the places he got started at, early on in his music career.  As far as the DVD content, I'm not quite sure why some tracks were cut out of the main performance, and listed as ""bonus tracks.""  Maybe that had to do with time or disc storage space concerns.  Still, an amazing live show from one of the world's greatest guitarist, living or otherwise.",1439510400,4,645,4.325

7132554,5,B00WHZZDGC,"Kick ass, relaxed yet tight performance in a more intimate setting.  They feed off the crowd more in a smaller venue.  Slash has excellent supporting musicians.  Myles Kennedy is particularly impressive.  Slash's t-shirt is ""interesting"".  Thumbs up.",1437350400,,250,5.648648648648648
7132555,4,B00WHZZDGC,"Obviously a great show from Slash. But, it is odd that the whole show was not given and 4 songs were put in as ""bonus tracks"".  Should have just been the whole show and be done with it.  And the audio sound could have been a little better.  But, worth it.",1437350400,,255,3.9607843137254903
7132556,5,B00WHZZDGC,Great dvd ftom a great show. Slash has really put together a grest band. Myles is by far the best singer going. What a range. Todd Kearns could be The lead singer in any other band not to mention he is a great musician. Frank Sidoris does what he is supposed to do holding down the rythem section with Brett Fitz who is a great drummer. Not only id Slash a great guitarist but check out the songs he has written. Very talented.,1437177600,,427,4.156626506024097
7132557,4,B00WHZZDGC,"Their music will always be five stars to me, but four in this instance because of the small venue, small crowd, IMO lacks the ambience of a larger venue/crowd.  One of the greatest band in history however, so well worth getting if you're a fan.",1437091200,,244,4.4222222222222225

7132561,5,B00WHZZDGC,Awesome!!,1435881600,,9,9.0
7132562,4,B00WHZZDGC,"The Good: After several years touring now, this band is still very tight.  They've always been skilled as musicians.  Put the two together and they put on a great show, and looked crisp doing it.  Even had the guts to throw in a power ballad (Bent to Fly).  Do wish they'd drop the endless f-bombs though.  They're all solid enough music-wise they really don't need that sophomoric crap.
The not-so-good:  Audio, even with DTS, was a bit muddled.  Was hoping this would be the DVD I pull out to demo my custom HTS, but both Todd's bass and Brent's cymbal work occasionally wound up weak in the mix.  Sad, given how good they both are live.  Would have loved to see more from their Apocalyptic Love album in the setlist too, or at least their cover of the Zeppelin tune they did in their Vegas show a couple years back.  It's axiomatic that if you do Led better than Led did, you should.  Maybe its a copyright thing...",1435536000,,918,4.404761904761905
7132563,5,B00WHZZDGC,"awesome concert live from the Roxy in Los Angeles. A must have for anyone a fan of guns and roses,Slash, And the fantastic vocals of myles Kennedy. axel Who? Slash is an amazing guitarist.",1434585600,2,188,4.5588235294117645
7132564,3,B00WHZZDGC,"I've seen Slash at least six times live and he always puts on a kick ass rock n' roll show. That said, it is very curious why this DVD does not include the full show. The full show is 19 songs and the DVD has only 13. There are four ""bonus"" tracks from the show, bringing the total to 17. But even with the bonus it is not the full show. Why? It's not as if the blu ray disc can't hold two hours of music. This whole thing makes no sense. Whoever came up with the idea to release a partial show on blu ray needs to have his head examined.",1434585600,5,538,3.8125

8713518,3,B00WHZZDGC,"As much as I wanted to like this, it's just plain mediocre. As soon As the disc booted and the music played during the menu selections I thought ewwww. I hope the actual concert audio doesn't sound that bad. I hit play and it does sound that bad. I won't pull out all the flowery terms audiophiles use, I'll just say it will leave you unimpressed. My playback system consists of professional studio monitors multiple 18"" subwoofers so there are no shortcomings In that department.  As others have said, the set list is short and incomplete. The band just doesn't seem to be on fire and I understand that you can't be 110% all the time. This wasn't a 110% night for them.

So what's the good news? The good news is that there was an excellent show that was recorded and available for free on YouTube. It's live from Sydney Australia in 2012 from Moshcam and it's a world of a difference. The audio is only 2 channel but it's so much better than what was mastered on the Bluray from the Roxy. The video looks decent as its h. 264 encoded MPEG4. This is a case where it's not the quality of the media (Bluray vs Streaming) but how the show was recorded, mixed, mastered and performed that make all difference in the world. On the YouTube show the band is playing their finest and it shows. Slash is on fire during the 2nd solo in Anastasia. (And he's playing it on a Les Paul as it should be!). My advice is to skip this disc and watch the Sydney show on YouTube for free.",1473292800,,1469,4.299638989169675
