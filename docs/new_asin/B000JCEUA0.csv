8149889,4,B000JCEUA0,This is very good DVD on how to build your own Cigar Box Guitar. I have built two so far and am currently finishing up my third. If Bill does a remake on this DVD I would like to see a section on how to build without the use of power tools and more details on measurements. Other than those two items this is the best instructional out there. You won't go wrong ordering this product!,1246320000,7,384,4.065789473684211
8149890,5,B000JCEUA0,"I've always wanted to make my own instrument.  In this video, Bill shows you how to do just that.  The great thing about his approach is that you can build one for around $30 in wood and parts and probably with the tools you already own.  I just needed to get a rasp, some files, and a fret saw.

After watching the video, I built a four-string cigar box guitar with a built in pickup that is fun to play.  I recently finished my second small guitar this time from scratch; it came out better than the first.  I'm busy planning my third instrument.

This video made the intimidating process of building an instrument accessible to and doable for the average person. Books and pictures have their place, but the video demonstrations of how to do it gave me the confidence to go for it. I'm glad I did; it opened up a whole new world to me and I'm not looking back.

It's hard to describe the thrill and satisfaction that comes from playing an instrument you built yourself.

Thanks Bill

8149891,5,B000JCEUA0,"As the curator of the National Cigar Box Guitar Museum, I have collected just about every instructional publication, book, article and other ephemera relating to cigar box guitars.  Bill Jehle's video is the most informative, encouraging and helpful tool for creating these magical instruments that I've ever seen.

First of all, the average buyer (with little or no woodworking skills) going to end up with a playable, fretted cigar box guitar...no doubt about it.  But Jehle doesn't just stop there.  His end goal is to encourage homegrown luthiers to use the basic skills of cigar box guitar building and let them flourish into eventually building 'normal' guitars and other instruments.

Jehle has the magical spark that Mr. Rogers had...he makes you believe in yourself and your humble skills.  I know that sounds hokey, but if you're on the fence about building your own instruments, Jehle will give you all the courage you need to tackle the project and come out triumphant.

And for those who don't know, cigar box guitars are becoming the next rumbling in the music underground.  Musicians of all calibers and styles are abandoning their store bought gear and adopting these primitive tools for a sound that's grittier, meaner...and deeper.

Join the cigar box guitar revolution.  This DVD is the ticket in.

I've built over 200 cigar box guitars and this video taught me a lot I didn't know.

Sincerely,
Shane Speal
