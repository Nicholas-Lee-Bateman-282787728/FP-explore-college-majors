The dancers in the class have a range of abilities, so the class does not star purely professional ballet dancers. The teacher, Kat, is a formal professional ballet dance with a very pleasant and fun personality (the type of teacher who is always making dancers laugh at themselves).  She gives many corrections throughout the class and thus it is also a good teaching tool. The DVD is chaptered but does not contain a separate chapter for the instruction and then the exercises. All exercise are done on both sides.",1334448000,,693,4.710743801652892
