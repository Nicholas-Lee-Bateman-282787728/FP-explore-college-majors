I have direct ancestors who found in this battle and many of the long rifles, pistols and swords were made by a relative. If you know where I can find a copy, e-mail Al at ccreb@bellsouth.net",1473724800,,365,4.382352941176471
8288235,5,B001CMVC2K,"I found this Video, most educational, and related to a significant segment of my personal heritage.  Lt. Col. James Reed (Reid), an Ancestor of mine, and his seven Sons that served under him, all fought in that very significant Battle.  Many are of the opinion that winning that particular Battle, was instrumental in winning the Revolutionary War.  Highly recommended to lovers of early American History.",1373241600,,405,5.2
8288236,5,B001CMVC2K,"From family history, I would say the DVD was historical accurate. It's description of the dress and mood of the Scot Irish was very accurate. However, there were heroes that were never mention. People who helped there and at Cowpens are ignored as they are in most of our history. Only the well known were mentioned. Two of the Bowen Men from Virginia who fought at Point Plesant died there or d/t injuries. But that would have taken some research and I guess it was unimportant to mention them. I wish some one would write an accurate book on the real heroes at Kings Mtn.",1336780800,,573,4.466666666666667
8288237,5,B001CMVC2K,"Very interesting. Historically accurate. Good film photography.

Every high school history class should be showing this. After all, it was a great turning point in the Revolutionary War.

If it were not for the Battle of King's Mountain and the Battle at Cowpens, instead of the Star Spangled Banner, we might just be singing "" God Save the Queen.""",1251158400,,348,4.88135593220339
