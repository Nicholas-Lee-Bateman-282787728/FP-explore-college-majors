6129577,5,B00H2WIXY4,"Great documentary. Ron Howard's 2013 RUSH was a great movie already--being a gripping and in-depth look, but 1976: HUNT V LAUDA documentary further immerses you into the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, two of Formula 1's first superstars. It gives us perspectives from both camps, and we get a balanced presentation in relation to the two sides. Its a great sports documentary to see, and if you liked Rush then you'll sure enjoy this",1386201600,7,445,4.868421052631579
6129578,5,B00H2WIXY4,"I watched a number of F1 documentaries lately and this is by far the best. I watched this film in the UK when it was broadcast by the BBC a few months ago. If you enjoyed Ron Howard film RUSH then you are simply going to love this! 1976: Hunt vs Lauda brings a tear to the eye of those who long for the day when health and safety meant waiting to step out of your death-trap racing car before sparking up a cigarette for the post-race interview. That was the late, great James Hunt, the medallion man with rock-star looks who dedicated his career to fulfilling the Top Gear fantasy of grand prix driver as a flamboyant playboy. Behind the wheel, all was deadly in earnest. Youre the only man I know who could be in a fire and come out better-looking, quipped Hunt with gallows humour after rival Niki Lauda almost died. The shadow over every race was the possibility that a driver might die  but that, to be frank, was what kept the watching millions enthralled. This is a must watch film.",1386115200,22,989,4.345945945945946

6129594,5,B00H2WIXY4,"this is 100 percent better than the ron howard movie,which was crap",1428105600,,67,4.666666666666667
6129595,5,B00H2WIXY4,"This film really illuminates the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda in a very personal and realistic way. The two polar opposites are contrasted and compared with outstanding archival footage and current interviews with respective team members, including Lauda himself, who were actually there and witnessed Hunt and Lauda's exhilarating wins and devastating defeats. The two men were actually professional friends, well aware of their divergent personalities, yet respectful of each others estimable racing talent. Lauda at one point mentions that Hunt was one of the few colleagues he would like to share a beer with. Great up front and personal footage of racers and spectators, including Lauda's beautiful wife, and her astonishment when he pulled out of the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix in the second lap due to unsafe weather conditions. He later said ""my life is worth more than a title"". Lauda's reticence was understandable after his near-fatal crash at the Nrburgring earlier that year in similar wet, dangerous conditions, although Hunt proceeded to win the championship. This is a winner, lots of information and excitement for Formula 1 fans everywhere.",1427673600,,1158,5.368131868131868

6129615,3,B00H2WIXY4,"I enjoyed this film with the vintage and current interviews. My complaint is that the narration during the racing scenes was so low the music and background sounds made it almost impossible to hear. The rest of the production was fine, but I can't understand how the movie was released with such a technical problem. I would give it 5 stars otherwise. Did anyone else have that problem or just me?",1391212800,5,397,4.605633802816901

8629309,3,B00H2WIXY4,"I wasn't so wild about this one. Besides the low voice level of the narrator, which is annoying if not life threatening, the lack of on track film footage was a let down. Instead the producers give a surfeit of face time to Alastair Caldwell and Daniele Audeto, the team managers at the time of McLaren and Ferrari respectively, a grand pair of knobs that were out of their depth back then and more clueless now. They should have concentrated on Peter Windsor and the unnamed older chap (Simon Thomas? I don't know) both of whom made real contributions to the story at hand.
What footage they chose to use was nice to see again after all these years but I'm always willing to view more, instead of a repetitive shot of a Monza straightaway with a constantly changing score board. I guess there's just no pleasing everybody or at least me!",1505606400,,838,4.519736842105263

8629315,5,B00H2WIXY4,"I haven't purchased this DVD. This review is of the movie, itself. I watched this movie after seeing & LOVING Ron Howard's Rush. If you're a gearhead/petrolhead & you haven't seen Rush, you're missing out! I found the documentary interesting in that it referred to Hunt & Lauda's friendship whereas Hollywood portrayed their rivalry as more bitter. After seeing the documentary, that aspect of Rush disappointed me. You don't need to HATE a rival to have them push you to excel. They were actually friends, and shared a flat together (something omitted in the Hollywood portrayal). I don't think the movie needed to portray them as so antagonistic to be a good film. But hey...that's Hollywood for you.",1492387200,,702,4.9576271186440675
