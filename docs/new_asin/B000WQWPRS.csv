2989725,4,B000WQWPRS,"Personally, I think that this is ""Sabrina's"" best season.  Sabrina Spellman uses lots of magic as she tries to solve the family secret and get her official witches licenses.  One of the best season's overall.  Cross your fingers that the DVDs will show it in all it's glory. <3.",1192406400,18,278,4.63265306122449

The excellent writers of this TV series had not yet run out of interesting ideas and unpredictable plot lines. One of the things we love most about this series are the ample changes of scenery--the viewer is not stuck with seeing the characters in the same setting for long periods of time. Salem the cat continues to amuse us with his dialogue and his dealing with having human emotions but being confined to a cat's body. One of the episodes in season 3 shows Salem being in a boy's body for a short time. Almost finished with Season 3 now and are looking forward to viewing seasons 4 through 7.",1468713600,,750,4.402877697841727

I saw the first 2 seasons at BJ's and remembered liking the show as a kid, so I bought them. I disnt realize just how good it was until watching it all over again! Great morals throughout if you want to get your kids into the show, with plenty of jokes for the older crowds that, while not inappropriate, the younger crowd won't be able to get. Truely a series for all ages. I've bought up to season 5 now, just need to get the last few to complete my set! If you don't own any yet, I think they just released a complete series set for a better price than buying individually (definitely worth it, even the weaker seasons are worth many re-watches).",1456358400,,815,4.230769230769231

2990108,5,B000WQWPRS,Very witty and fun! This season of Sabrina The Teenage Witch just draws you in. Solving the family secret keeps Sabrina on her toes the majority of the season. One thing I did not enjoy about the DVD version is the songs that are on these episodes. The majority of them are removed I'm assuming for copyright laws or something of that nature. Otherwise I could watch this season over and over again! It never loses its uniqueness.,1436918400,,430,4.5256410256410255

2990142,5,B000WQWPRS,"I freely admit there is nothing deep or classic about Sabrina the Teenage Witch.  But I love the fantasy and humor the show represents.  And the third season continues to charm.

As season two ended, Sabrina Spellman (Melissa Joan Hart) thought got her witch's license, a step she thought would give her all knowledge and power.  Unfortunately, she finds out there's one little hitch.  She can't actually use it until she solves the Spellman family secret.  Helping her do that are her aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick).  And there's also the family cat, Salem (voiced by Nick Bakay).

But Sabrina also has to deal with life as a normal teenage.  That means school.  Things haven't changed too much in that regard this season.  She still has her best friend Valerie (Lindsay Sloane) and boyfriend Harvey (Nate Richert).  Unfortunately, that also means she is dealing with head cheerleader Libby (Jenna Leigh Green) who hates Sabrina.  And even worse, Aunt Zelda has started dating vice Principal Willard Kraft (Martin Mull).

So, what kind of problems can a teenage witch get into?  She discovers that her family becomes addicted to pancakes.  Salem bets Sabrina and her aunts in a high stakes poker game - and loses.  Christmas almost goes the way of Bo Bunk.  Sabrina must face off against some pirates after her magic has turned fake.  When Sabrina and Hilda try a silent spell to keep from ruining Zelda's special night with Mr. Kraft, the house turns into a black and white silent movie.  Sabrina's life gets turned into a reality TV show against her will.  All this leads to the season finale in which we finally learn the Spellman family secret, only to learn that it might mean the end of Sabrina.

While this season doesn't start out with a birthday episode, it does include Halloween and Christmas episodes.  Somehow, they pretend that seasons two and three take place in one year so that they can keep Sabrina in high school for four years.  (She just turned sixteen as season one started), but that's a rant for another time.

What is here is plenty of fun.  Yes, the show follows a pretty basic formula, but the paths they take are always so creative that I can't help but get caught up in the episode no matter how many times I've seen it.  And yes, I keep laughing all the way through, too.

The show lived on special effects, and they really did a decent job with them.  Occasionally, you can tell when they cut a scene to add an effect, but most of the time, I'm fooled.  Okay, so I'm not trying that hard to see the trick behind the effect.  I like believing what I am watching.

The acting is great as always.  One reason I think I like the show is I love how much fun the cast seems to be having together.  Yes, I feel like even the characters we're not supposed to like actually did enjoy being on the show.  That chemistry makes me believe all the performances that much more.

And, as always, the guest cast is top notch.  N'Sync and Jerry Springer pop by as themselves for one episode.  Other guests include Ruth Buzzi and an early appearance by Frankie Muniz.  But my favorite bit of guest star casting was Julia Duffy of Newhart fame as Principal Kraft's witch of a first wife.

Like previous seasons of the show, this release is bare bones.  We get all 25 half hour episodes on four discs, and that's it.  The picture and stereo sound are good.

Nope, Sabrina the Teenage Witch wasn't breaking any new ground with season 3.  But it was fun and creative, and that keeps me coming back to keep laughing all over again.  This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures.

Trivia Note: In one episode, Aunt Hilda is deported to The Other Realm because she has not properly filled out her immigration paper work.  The test she fails involves her pronouncing certain words like a Canadian.  Caroline Rhea, who plays her, is from Canada.  I always get a special kick out of that one.",1430870400,4,3919,4.569784172661871

2990257,5,B000WQWPRS,I was skimming through the TV DVD offerings when I came upon this show that I liked when I was younger. I had completely forgotten about this show and watching it has brought back fond memories and I can definitely relate to the characters on this show (not counting Sabrina's magical powers). And I agree with the one reviewer who loved Libby...she's a real hoot and a likeable villain. And the special effects (especially the ones that make Salem talk) are great.,1405468800,2,465,4.682926829268292
2990258,4,B000WQWPRS,"I loved this series when I first saw it in the later 1990's. As I recall, it ran from 1996 to 2003.

It is more than the adventures of a teenage witch in high school (four seasons) and college (three seasons), living with her two aunts because her witch father is stuck in a book of magic, and unable to live with her mother for the first two years of her training due to her mom's mortality interfering somehow with her blossoming, just discovered, powers.

The show is a commentary on how the gifted student often has trouble fitting in at school, the troubles he has getting along with his peers, getting teased by the jocks and cheerleaders, and not having outlets for average recreation with others.

Yes, many of the comedic situations have mainly to do with how people see the results of the witchcraft then try to explain it away. The principal especially provides some comic relief, especially when he dates one, then the other aunt for awhile.

With this review, I am reviewing all seven seasons of Sabrina. The first two seasons were better than the third and fourth, in my humble opinion, then when she got into college and moved into a house with several other students, the plots brightened back up again because there were new situations to be explored.

Seasons 1-2: Five Stars
Seasons 3-4: Four Stars
Season 5: Five Stars
Seasons 6-7: Four Stars

If you enjoy comedy, and you enjoy witchcraft that sometimes goes wrong, and you enjoy seeing different views of life, then get these sets. I wouldn't have paid for them, but I was delighted to get them ""free"" as a perk of my membership in Amazon Prime.",1405382400,,1617,4.597222222222222

2990381,3,B000WQWPRS,"Sabrina takes a more comedic and guessable plot for each episode. The sitcom revolves around Sabrina a high school student who is also a witch, with the help of her aunts who guide her on using her witch powers. Since an episode is only twenty minutes each episode doesn't have to be watched in order. There are seven seasons which is surprising, since there isn't much plot development. This show is more comedic to supernatural, however shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer are more intense with plot and character development, Buffy has eight seasons and the episodes are twice as long as Sabrina. I usually watch this to pass time, but the writing in each episode is predictable and so it doesn't require much to watch a few episodes at a time. When watching a lot of episodes at a time it can be grating because there's not much substance. Essentially if your looking for a TV show that you won't get involved in spending your time watching this is a good show. I didn't know that Melissa Joan Hart was on nickolodean before Sabrina. She currently has her own show on ABC family which has the same characteristics but isn't supernatural and is like other family sitcoms on ABC Family.",1379116800,,1188,4.6350710900473935

In other words, it doesn't focus on violence, but rather focuses on many of the typical problems of growing up, navigating high school, forming relationships, and dealing with family, with the added problem of magic, which more often than not gets Sabrina into trouble. The first seasons are the best specifically for this reason.

2990415,5,B000WQWPRS,This season is my favorite. It have my favorite one Pancake Madness. Sabrina is so funny. By the way this is the last season to have more then 22 episodes all the other seasons have 22. Final season for Valerie and Libby. It's a great season and very funny. I also love the part about the family secret. By the way do you have pancakes.,1216166400,2,336,4.184615384615385
2990416,4,B000WQWPRS,"When I first read on the internet , that the sabrina DVDs would be edited, I never realised this as being a big problem. I hardly noticed anything in season two and in season one the 'a girl like you' song was missing, which was a bit crap to find out.

So anyway, after watching the edited versions of the first seasons , it didn't seem to me as too cut until I got season three. But season three has more problems then the previous seasons: Phantom Planet was credited on the dvd for an appearence that you could not see on this version. Before the band should have appeared, this version just fades to black and you get the Sabrina introduction. Then a lot of music gets replaced by simple instrumental songs that don't even seem to fit to what is happening. The halloween episode had a great moment in where the ""monster mash song"" was played. Also , this song was removed.

Apart from noticeble songs missing (and a few scenes) this dvd set is great and the show itself is huge fun to watch. If you know the show by buying the dvds , it might be new to you and you won't have to worry about anything. But fans that know the show from the original airings will definetly miss a few things and some people will dislike that more then I did.

Another thing that isn't that good about the dvd-set is, that there are no extras whatsoever. Not even animated dvd menus or a little commentary. If you love the show and are just happy of being able to watch it, you'll live with that too . ;)

2990419,5,B000WQWPRS,"Sabrina, the Third Season

There are few shows that guarantee entertainment and mirth every time you watch it.

The third season of Sabrina introduced her witches license, something more dangerous than a drivers license to a teenager.  As we all know, the world of Sabrina Spellman is twisted enough without more freedom.  Some of the messes she finds herself in include the family secret, the compliment spell, Sabrina tries out for the cheer leader squad, Sabrina erases Christmas, Mr Kraft's other worldly wife is exposed, Salem creates a reality show based on the Spellman household, the world of silent films becomes real once more when a silence spell kicks in, and Salem tries to take over the world!

However you get this DVD, run, mail order, or order through the Other Realm Special Services, get it!  As they say, there's no show like it.

Look for it at your local video dealer or online at [...]

The excellent writers of this TV series had not yet run out of interesting ideas and unpredictable plot lines. One of the things we love most about this series are the ample changes of scenery--the viewer is not stuck with seeing the characters in the same setting for long periods of time. Salem the cat continues to amuse us with his dialogue and his dealing with having human emotions but being confined to a cat's body. One of the episodes in season 3 shows Salem being in a boy's body for a short time. Almost finished with Season 3 now and are looking forward to viewing seasons 4 through 7.",1468713600,,750,4.402877697841727

I saw the first 2 seasons at BJ's and remembered liking the show as a kid, so I bought them. I disnt realize just how good it was until watching it all over again! Great morals throughout if you want to get your kids into the show, with plenty of jokes for the older crowds that, while not inappropriate, the younger crowd won't be able to get. Truely a series for all ages. I've bought up to season 5 now, just need to get the last few to complete my set! If you don't own any yet, I think they just released a complete series set for a better price than buying individually (definitely worth it, even the weaker seasons are worth many re-watches).",1456358400,,815,4.230769230769231

3224605,5,B000WQWPRS,Very witty and fun! This season of Sabrina The Teenage Witch just draws you in. Solving the family secret keeps Sabrina on her toes the majority of the season. One thing I did not enjoy about the DVD version is the songs that are on these episodes. The majority of them are removed I'm assuming for copyright laws or something of that nature. Otherwise I could watch this season over and over again! It never loses its uniqueness.,1436918400,,430,4.5256410256410255

3224639,5,B000WQWPRS,"I freely admit there is nothing deep or classic about Sabrina the Teenage Witch.  But I love the fantasy and humor the show represents.  And the third season continues to charm.

As season two ended, Sabrina Spellman (Melissa Joan Hart) thought got her witch's license, a step she thought would give her all knowledge and power.  Unfortunately, she finds out there's one little hitch.  She can't actually use it until she solves the Spellman family secret.  Helping her do that are her aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick).  And there's also the family cat, Salem (voiced by Nick Bakay).

But Sabrina also has to deal with life as a normal teenage.  That means school.  Things haven't changed too much in that regard this season.  She still has her best friend Valerie (Lindsay Sloane) and boyfriend Harvey (Nate Richert).  Unfortunately, that also means she is dealing with head cheerleader Libby (Jenna Leigh Green) who hates Sabrina.  And even worse, Aunt Zelda has started dating vice Principal Willard Kraft (Martin Mull).

So, what kind of problems can a teenage witch get into?  She discovers that her family becomes addicted to pancakes.  Salem bets Sabrina and her aunts in a high stakes poker game - and loses.  Christmas almost goes the way of Bo Bunk.  Sabrina must face off against some pirates after her magic has turned fake.  When Sabrina and Hilda try a silent spell to keep from ruining Zelda's special night with Mr. Kraft, the house turns into a black and white silent movie.  Sabrina's life gets turned into a reality TV show against her will.  All this leads to the season finale in which we finally learn the Spellman family secret, only to learn that it might mean the end of Sabrina.

While this season doesn't start out with a birthday episode, it does include Halloween and Christmas episodes.  Somehow, they pretend that seasons two and three take place in one year so that they can keep Sabrina in high school for four years.  (She just turned sixteen as season one started), but that's a rant for another time.

What is here is plenty of fun.  Yes, the show follows a pretty basic formula, but the paths they take are always so creative that I can't help but get caught up in the episode no matter how many times I've seen it.  And yes, I keep laughing all the way through, too.

The show lived on special effects, and they really did a decent job with them.  Occasionally, you can tell when they cut a scene to add an effect, but most of the time, I'm fooled.  Okay, so I'm not trying that hard to see the trick behind the effect.  I like believing what I am watching.

The acting is great as always.  One reason I think I like the show is I love how much fun the cast seems to be having together.  Yes, I feel like even the characters we're not supposed to like actually did enjoy being on the show.  That chemistry makes me believe all the performances that much more.

And, as always, the guest cast is top notch.  N'Sync and Jerry Springer pop by as themselves for one episode.  Other guests include Ruth Buzzi and an early appearance by Frankie Muniz.  But my favorite bit of guest star casting was Julia Duffy of Newhart fame as Principal Kraft's witch of a first wife.

Like previous seasons of the show, this release is bare bones.  We get all 25 half hour episodes on four discs, and that's it.  The picture and stereo sound are good.

Nope, Sabrina the Teenage Witch wasn't breaking any new ground with season 3.  But it was fun and creative, and that keeps me coming back to keep laughing all over again.  This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures.

Trivia Note: In one episode, Aunt Hilda is deported to The Other Realm because she has not properly filled out her immigration paper work.  The test she fails involves her pronouncing certain words like a Canadian.  Caroline Rhea, who plays her, is from Canada.  I always get a special kick out of that one.",1430870400,4,3919,4.569784172661871

3224754,5,B000WQWPRS,I was skimming through the TV DVD offerings when I came upon this show that I liked when I was younger. I had completely forgotten about this show and watching it has brought back fond memories and I can definitely relate to the characters on this show (not counting Sabrina's magical powers). And I agree with the one reviewer who loved Libby...she's a real hoot and a likeable villain. And the special effects (especially the ones that make Salem talk) are great.,1405468800,2,465,4.682926829268292
3224755,4,B000WQWPRS,"I loved this series when I first saw it in the later 1990's. As I recall, it ran from 1996 to 2003.

It is more than the adventures of a teenage witch in high school (four seasons) and college (three seasons), living with her two aunts because her witch father is stuck in a book of magic, and unable to live with her mother for the first two years of her training due to her mom's mortality interfering somehow with her blossoming, just discovered, powers.

The show is a commentary on how the gifted student often has trouble fitting in at school, the troubles he has getting along with his peers, getting teased by the jocks and cheerleaders, and not having outlets for average recreation with others.

Yes, many of the comedic situations have mainly to do with how people see the results of the witchcraft then try to explain it away. The principal especially provides some comic relief, especially when he dates one, then the other aunt for awhile.

With this review, I am reviewing all seven seasons of Sabrina. The first two seasons were better than the third and fourth, in my humble opinion, then when she got into college and moved into a house with several other students, the plots brightened back up again because there were new situations to be explored.

Seasons 1-2: Five Stars
Seasons 3-4: Four Stars
Season 5: Five Stars
Seasons 6-7: Four Stars

If you enjoy comedy, and you enjoy witchcraft that sometimes goes wrong, and you enjoy seeing different views of life, then get these sets. I wouldn't have paid for them, but I was delighted to get them ""free"" as a perk of my membership in Amazon Prime.",1405382400,,1617,4.597222222222222

3224878,3,B000WQWPRS,"Sabrina takes a more comedic and guessable plot for each episode. The sitcom revolves around Sabrina a high school student who is also a witch, with the help of her aunts who guide her on using her witch powers. Since an episode is only twenty minutes each episode doesn't have to be watched in order. There are seven seasons which is surprising, since there isn't much plot development. This show is more comedic to supernatural, however shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer are more intense with plot and character development, Buffy has eight seasons and the episodes are twice as long as Sabrina. I usually watch this to pass time, but the writing in each episode is predictable and so it doesn't require much to watch a few episodes at a time. When watching a lot of episodes at a time it can be grating because there's not much substance. Essentially if your looking for a TV show that you won't get involved in spending your time watching this is a good show. I didn't know that Melissa Joan Hart was on nickolodean before Sabrina. She currently has her own show on ABC family which has the same characteristics but isn't supernatural and is like other family sitcoms on ABC Family.",1379116800,,1188,4.6350710900473935

3224896,5,B000WQWPRS,"Unlike modern fantasy shows, Sabrina doesn't focus on scary evil forces that must be destroyed. In other words, it doesn't focus on violence, but rather focuses on many of the typical problems of growing up, navigating high school, forming relationships, and dealing with family, with the added problem of magic, which more often than not gets Sabrina into trouble. The first seasons are the best specifically for this reason. Once Sabrina goes off to college, the show loses some of its appeal, but I stuck with it and was very pleased with how the show ended in its final season.",1376092800,,581,4.82

3224912,5,B000WQWPRS,This season is my favorite. It have my favorite one Pancake Madness. Sabrina is so funny. By the way this is the last season to have more then 22 episodes all the other seasons have 22. Final season for Valerie and Libby. It's a great season and very funny. I also love the part about the family secret. By the way do you have pancakes.,1216166400,2,336,4.184615384615385
3224913,4,B000WQWPRS,"When I first read on the internet , that the sabrina DVDs would be edited, I never realised this as being a big problem. I hardly noticed anything in season two and in season one the 'a girl like you' song was missing, which was a bit crap to find out.

So anyway, after watching the edited versions of the first seasons , it didn't seem to me as too cut until I got season three. But season three has more problems then the previous seasons: Phantom Planet was credited on the dvd for an appearence that you could not see on this version. Before the band should have appeared, this version just fades to black and you get the Sabrina introduction. Then a lot of music gets replaced by simple instrumental songs that don't even seem to fit to what is happening. The halloween episode had a great moment in where the ""monster mash song"" was played. Also , this song was removed.

Apart from noticeble songs missing (and a few scenes) this dvd set is great and the show itself is huge fun to watch. If you know the show by buying the dvds , it might be new to you and you won't have to worry about anything. But fans that know the show from the original airings will definetly miss a few things and some people will dislike that more then I did.

Another thing that isn't that good about the dvd-set is, that there are no extras whatsoever. Not even animated dvd menus or a little commentary. If you love the show and are just happy of being able to watch it, you'll live with that too . ;)

3224916,5,B000WQWPRS,"Sabrina, the Third Season

There are few shows that guarantee entertainment and mirth every time you watch it.

The third season of Sabrina introduced her witches license, something more dangerous than a drivers license to a teenager.  As we all know, the world of Sabrina Spellman is twisted enough without more freedom.  Some of the messes she finds herself in include the family secret, the compliment spell, Sabrina tries out for the cheer leader squad, Sabrina erases Christmas, Mr Kraft's other worldly wife is exposed, Salem creates a reality show based on the Spellman household, the world of silent films becomes real once more when a silence spell kicks in, and Salem tries to take over the world!

However you get this DVD, run, mail order, or order through the Other Realm Special Services, get it!  As they say, there's no show like it.

Look for it at your local video dealer or online at [...]

I now think it's also annoying, and hectic in a way that sours the mood in my living room.  People walk too fast, deliver their lines in compact bursts, and obviously mug for laughs.  (Canned laughs yet.)  The series gets all its mileage from iterations of two or three situations, and ties itself to a time its target audience no longer recognizes.  Guest shots by athletes only add something if people know who they are.  They're a distraction once their moments of fame are over.

8225238,4,B000WQWPRS,"Sabrina is a remarkably well-written show, with a great ensemble cast, suitable for all ages, and entertaining for all ages as well. Seasons 1-3 are especially good. When the aunts--Zelda and Hilda--fade away in later seasons, when Sabrina heads for college and career, things become more routine. In fact, magic begins fading from the series as well, because Sabrina is no longer embedded in a household where magic is par for the course. She has to hide her gifts, which adds a constraint for the writers and turns the series into a rather ordinary sitcom, merely seasoned with magic rather than pervaded by it. Above all, please note: Salem Saberhagen the Cat, voiced by Nick Bakay, is one of the small screen's great comic inventions, once a wizard with world domination on his mind, sentenced to feline form by the Witch's Council, now with little more than snacks on his devious mind.",1486166400,,890,4.8618421052631575
