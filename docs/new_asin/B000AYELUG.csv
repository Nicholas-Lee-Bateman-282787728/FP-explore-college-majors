8173541,4,B000AYELUG,"Direct transfer from VHS of the Live In LA VHS. The first gig is Live at the Olympic Auditorium during their USA tour presenting their then upcoming A Fridge Too Far lp. Superbly shot with just 3 cameras with a particularly creative on-stage cameraman takes and a great editing job. The american crowd is OTT enthusiastic and tries to climb on stage ALL the time so the frontal takes of the band are somewhat blocked by a row of overzelous bouncers and the whole atmosphere is riotous contributing to the live feel. The band blaze through some classics and a lot of their more metallic mid-period songs. The sound is almost excellent but for a guitar imbalance to the right channnel which causes it to sound much louder than the left one but I switched it to mono and solved it satisfactorily. Overall sound improves as the gig progresses and on the second night section it's just killer; the snares are much louder and the cymbals are audible. Picture is OK vhs 4:3; at least Cherry Red picked a mint copy for the transfer this time. No 5.1 option though. Great volume unlike other concert dvds.

As a bonus we get an old but wonderful gig from 83 : Live At Victoria Hanley. The filming is on par with the main feature but the sound has less treble and the bottom end is more one-note boom but the band kicks your head in with their most interesting singles; a hell of a setlist.

The dvd clocks in at a whooping 90' so the lack of extras and interviews is nothing to worry about but they would have been a welcome addition to round up an already excellent package.",1255132800,,1566,4.434027777777778
