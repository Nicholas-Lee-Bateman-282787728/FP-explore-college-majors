8162286,1,B000LMPMZK,"In this video, tou watch Jim McLean teach an awful golfer for ten lessons in the hope that he can break 100 at Doral. The pupil is a very nice guy and ex-cop who you would NOT want to be following on a golf course, but who you'd want to have a beer with after your round.  McLean spends a lot of time with him correcting basic flaws in his game.  It is doubtful that anyone who has ever had a lesson will learn anything new here.  You do end up rooting for him as he takes on his final challenge (no spoiler here), but save your money and watch this on television.",1207094400,,564,3.9734513274336285
8162287,4,B000LMPMZK,"Take your average 30+ handicap and give him 10 lessons to see if that improves his play.
This is a Golf Channel production, which means that you won't see anything extra. If you have seen the episode on the Golf Channel, that's all there is.

The lessons are interesting and I can see the benefit of what is being taught.

I understand why the producers spent time with the players family, but I feel it detracted from the tape. When I only have 30 to 45 minutes of golf instruction and the lessons are interesting, there is no need to see him family surroundings. That's not why I'm watching the DVD.",1200787200,,601,4.405405405405405
8162288,4,B000LMPMZK,"This was one of the first series The Golf Channel produced that addressed golfers' obsession with numbers . . . in this case, achieving that magical score of less than 100 for the first time.  Star of the series is an average golfer and we get to follow him as, with some help from TGC, he works to lower his score.

Followed up by breaking 90 and breaking 80.",1175731200,,360,4.202898550724638
