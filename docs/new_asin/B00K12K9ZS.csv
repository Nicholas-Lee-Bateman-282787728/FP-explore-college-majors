8655079,5,B00K12K9ZS,"I love this disc set. My father used to watch this show when I was a child and I clearly remembered liking it then.  The narrative is a little monotone, and some of the same animal shots are repeated on the dvd's but you cannot beat the price for the set! I love it and my small children love it.",1453420800,,296,3.933333333333333
8655080,4,B00K12K9ZS,"I absolutely enjoy these programs and would give them alone a 5 stars. These were filmed without all the high tech video techniques available today. If you watch the last ""Specials"" DVD entitled ""Marty's World"" you will get a greater appreciation for what he went through to capture  the great wildlife footage in this series, plus you will find out how he got started in wildlife filming as a child,along with his 2 brothers.

 My only complaint and the reason I only actually gave a 4 star rating is due to the way the DVD's are packaged. There is the box as seen in the picture and in it are 2 DVD cases, each containing 6 disc's on a single spindle. That means if you want to see disk 6, you have to remove the other 5 stacked on top of it ect! Other than that, I highly recommend these specials as well as the original series DVD's. If you are an Amazon Prime member you can view this series through ""Prime Instant Video"", or if not, you can rent an episode to see if you like it before purchasing the set.",1453334400,,1011,4.255208333333333
8655081,5,B00K12K9ZS,An absolutely great series about America's animals. Very good for whole family to watch. My kids grew up on these and now I have them for grandchildren. Certainly something that should be passed on.  Superb!,1453334400,,207,4.914285714285715
