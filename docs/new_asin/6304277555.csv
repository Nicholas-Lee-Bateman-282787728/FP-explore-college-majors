870423,2,6304277555,"This movie is the most banal of the banal.
It basically felt like someone threw some good actors into a room, and I stared at them do nothing for 100 minutes.
It felt as if both the actors and the director knew the script was so boring that nobody tried. Or, maybe the director and script were so bad that trying didn't help. Not sure which.
In any case, this is a gangland/cop drama that has nothing to add to the genre.",1384819200,,421,4.146341463414634
870424,2,6304277555,"Once again, thanks to WWE Classics On Demand, I was able to check out an old WWF PPV entitled In Your House: Bad Blood '97. Now a couple of things should be noted in that this was the event that would debut a match that had never been seen before & would become a stable for the WWE for many years including naming it as one of their PPV events, this was also the last event where the ""In Your House"" moniker was used as the head title while the names started to stand out above that name in the future & unfortunately, this event was held the day that Brian Pillman had passed away taking out his match with Dude Love from the card & adding two bonus matches such as a midget match & a 8 man tag match between Los Boricuas vs D.O.A. However since I saw the WWE Classics On Demand version, those two matches weren't shown on the broadcast.

The Legion Of Doom vs The Nation Of Domination. It should be mentioned that the team consisting of the Nation was D'Lo Brown, Kama Mustafa & the recently turned Rocky Maivia who would later be known as The Rock. This was scheduled to be a six man tag with Ken Shamrock teaming up with Hawk & Animal but due to injury, Shamrock was taken off the card & LOD decided to take this handicap challenge. LOD started off great by using their power & even resorting to some fast paced offense including doing a series of dropkicks before The Rock took advantage of the number's gain. From there, each member of the Nation kept control by working over Animal with a series of moves including D'Lo's frogsplash before the tide turn with Hawk's run-in but with the appearance of another Nation member, the odds were too much for the LOD.

WWF Tag Team Champions The Headbangers vs The Godwinns. The Headbangers were on a role at this point after winning the titles at Ground Zero while it should be mentioned that Sunny did the ring-announcing for this match. This wasn't much when it came to tag team action as the match was just adull but average at best but past that, nothing memorable.

Intercontinental Championship: Owen Hart vs Faarooq. This was the finals of the Intercontinental Title tournament due to the former champion, Stone Cold Steve Austin forfeiting the title due to injury. Before the match got underway, Stone Cold Steve Austin made his way to the ring to provide his own taste on color commentary to all three announce teams before providing his own taste on the timekeeper's position. Austin was the vocal point of this match as the match itself was again average but the bigger story was how Austin's role played a factor in the outcome that even left the winner in shocked.

Flag Match: Bret Hart & British Bulldog vs The Patriot & Vader. Before I begin, check out the pre-match promo between Vader & Patriot as Vader forgot this was a ""PG"" show (well for the nineties anyways). This was scheduled to be a ""capture the flag"" style match but due to the injuries of everyone involved, it was also added the match could end by pinfall or submission. This started off wild with all four men brawling on the outside, on the announce tables & even using the Canadian & American flags before settling in the ring. Vader had the power advantage as it usually took the offense of both Bret & Bulldog get the advantage on the big man. Bret worked on both men's legs to take away the chance of either Patriot & Vader getting the flag before all hell broke loose again allowing Bret to stay one step ahead of the American team. Even though it's clear that I am no fan of The Patriot, this was the best match that he was in during his WWF run as the match was more of a brawl which hid his obvious weakness while everyone else held their own.

Hell In A Cell: The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels. Due to how out of control their previous match at Ground Zero was, this lead to the rematch with both men becoming innovators in their own right with the caged structure known as ""Hell In A Cell"". The Cell structure was unique for it's time as the cage covered the outside area with a roof on top of it meaning that prevented any interference. Based on how this feud was built, Undertaker started off aggressive by using his power & even the Cell various times while Michaels kept trying to stay away from Taker before breaking Taker's momentum with one mistake. From there, HBK dished out his own share of punishment by using his high-flying style along with using the Cell as a launching pad for moves like a torpedo through the ropes & an elbow drop on the floor. The steel steps came into effect along with a chair that also featured one spot where HBK delivered a piledriver on the steps that you could just see & hear the impact along with Michaels taking out a cameraman in the process. Taker was able to regain momentum with both men exiting the cage that lead to various moments such as HBK being a bloody mess, both men fighting on top of the cell, HBK taking a fall from the side of the Cell that would be topped by Mankind's fall a year later before getting back in the ring where HBK faced ""poetic justice"" from what happened at SummerSlam. However, it was at this moment where we saw the debut of a superstar from Taker's past that Paul Bearer had promised for months that lead to a result nobody saw coming. Even though there have been many HIAC matches since, this one has stood out to me as far as in-ring work & psychology to the point where Taker considers this to be his favorite match of his career...despite coming out on the losing end.

Overall, this was a one match show which was the Hell In A Cell match as the rest of the card was mostly average with the main event standing above everything else but this match has been released throughout various DVD sets (including Taker & Shawn's sets & not counting the HIAC DVD itself) so this isn't worth going out of your way to see unless you find this online or really cheap.",1319414400,,5882,4.401654411764706
870425,5,6304277555,This is a really cool movie. It's about two brothers heading the wrong way in life. One escapes and years later tries to help his brother escape the bad life to.,1243987200,2,161,4.225806451612903
870426,4,6304277555,"This movie is actually enjoyable! I enjoyed watching the fight scenes in the movie between the two rival gangs. The Trueblood brothers have great parts and little Chad Lowe makes a great first impression. He's the toughest of the two brothers, but holds a special place in your heart. The special effects weren't great compared to newer action films. The characters reminded me David Lynch's characters, especially the evil Billy ""Spider"" Masters. He had a very creepy part and watching it alone can be quite scary. Ok, so the real reason to see this film, is for Sherilyn Fenn. Her part is acted very well.",1107648000,13,607,4.79047619047619
870427,3,6304277555,"Especially with short hair!  Otherwise the plot is tolerable, although only just.  Lukewarm performances from Fahey and Lowe, but the bald dude from Top Gun is in this and that makes for some fun dialogue.  Overall, if you're looking for a decent movie, you might look elsewhere...",1020211200,5,281,4.9361702127659575
870428,5,6304277555,"This movie doesn't get the credit it deserves. It's classic good versus evil and the people chosen to personify this were well chosen. Jeff Fahey (Sketch Artist) does a credible job at being a caring brother who pulls himself out of the slums at a price. His brother is played by Chad Lowe (Apartment Complex) who delivers as a confused teenager. The evil pursuing these two is masterfully done by one of the best bad guys in the business, Billy Drago. His performance as a gang leader displays his masterful ability to frighten. His performance here will help send his career forward into movies such as ""Death Ring"" and ""Deadly Heros"". Every actor starts somewhere and this film did it for Fahey and Drago. Give this film a shot.",1016064000,21,731,4.674418604651163
870429,5,6304277555,"I had to drive all the way to canada to get this tape, and believe me, it was worth it! The hell in the cell match was one of the best matches I've ever seen! The finals to the badd blood intercontinental tournement between the late Owen Hart and Farroq was pretty sweet too! All the other matches are pretty good (for a 1997 standard) except for the tag title match wich sucked royaly! Althogh it was the pay-per-veiw that contained the announcement of the untimley death of Brian Pillman, I still advise you to purchase this video.
