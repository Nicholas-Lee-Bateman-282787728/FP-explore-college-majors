8679701,5,B00NPK8UQ8,"This was the first foreign film I ever saw - In a vintage small theater in a charming little neighborhood in San Diego. Theater was full of young intellectuals and students, like a Woody Allen movie but without the stupidity. The film was a pretty good introduction to ""art film"" for me: What's called a ""small film,"" meaning it doesn't have a cast of thousands, didn't take three years in the making, and wasn't intended to thrill and astound. No one came out saying ""Well, I thought the photography was very well done."" It's a bio of an artist, and it tells the story with just enough dramatic license. A lot of the virtue is in the stars: Anouk Aime, Lilli Palmer, and Grard Philipe - And others. Both the subject of the bio, Modigliani, and the actor who played him in this film died young, only 35 and 36 and both famously handsome. I have heard there is another cut of the film that is much longer than this version. Someday maybe I'll find that.",1453852800,,952,4.4147727272727275

is not made for USA video machines",1418342400,2,129,3.9615384615384617
8679703,5,B00NPK8UQ8,"The fatal circumstances that surrounded this film transcend any rational speech. This movie deals with the last year of life of the Italian-French painter Amedeo Modigliani (1884-1920) who died with 36 years; on the other hand was played by Grard Philipe, who was lethally sick during the shooting of this movie and died shortly after its release, 1959, with 36 years on one of the two diseases that Modigliano had himself and exactly in his age. Additionally, Max Ophlus, his director died suddenly and Becker would die 2 years after.

All the cast involved was aware Philipe went to take a slow boat to China, and Becker conscious of it took advantage to reflect still more the tragedy of the painter. As a matter of fact, the sequence in which Modigliani says:""Jeanne, on the other side, there will be eternal joy, isn't that so, Jeanne?"".

After the previous comment I just can assure you that probably we are in front the most neglected and overlooked masterpiece of the cinema ever.

So, if you consider we had to wait more that half century to get a decent edition of this picture, you may feel yourself more than lucky in order to purchase it.

Totally recommended.",1382832000,2,1173,4.735294117647059
