8363950,5,B002CGT128,Popular cartoon in Germany years ago and is really simple for a younger child. These are English spoken versions. Basically short adventures that keep  the attention of the little one the entire DVD so yes worth it. Not educational in any way just fun to watch.,1501977600,,261,4.673913043478261
