6872627,5,B00QJN33Q0,"Every now and again a person hopes that someday one of their favorite television shows from decades gone by will find its home on DVD. Like other fans of ""Maude"" ( and we are a large group of ""Maude"" junkies) several years ago ""Season One"" of ""Maude""  was released, then suddenly no new seasons. I was really miffed! Not only was the show one of the biggest television hits of the 1970's, an Emmy winner for Beatrice Arthur, it was a reflection of the times for the women's movement when women were saying, ""We are just as equal as men if not at times better"". No one could say that line better than Maude herself.

 Thankfully Shout Factory will be releasing the entire series on DVD in one complete set like they did for other great sitcoms by Norman Lear, most notably ""The Jeffersons"" and ""All in the Family"" in which ""Maude"" was spun off from.

 In this remarkable set you get all 141 episodes spanning the years the series ran on CBS from 1972-1978, the special episode from ""All in the Family"" that introduced Maude to American audiences in the episode called ""Cousin Maude"" which aired in late 1971 and became ""All in the Family's"" highest-rated episode that season (by the way Maude is Edith Bunker's first cousin...their mothers were sisters) and you also get the unofficial ""pilot""  show from ""All in the Family"" that aired in the spring of 1972 and would launch the show.  What is noticeable in that episode was the lack of acting by the actress who played the original Carol, Maude's daughter...thankfully when ""Maude"" went to series in the fall of '71 Adrienne Barbeau and the rest is history.

 Also included are two never-before seen episodes recently fond in the Sony archives of ""Maude"" that were never aired on CBS or in syndication! These show's scripts would be reworked and redone in other episodes, but this is a real treat for classic television historians.

 The cast of ""Maude"" was superb. Before she was Blanche on ""The Golden Girls"" Rue McClanahan played Maude's best friend Vivienne. Their chemistry on this series is evident and I can't help but think that Maude and Vivienne were the younger versions of Dorothy and Blanche. Conrad Bain was great here too as his character bumped heads with Maude several times and Bill Macy gave a virtuoso performance throughout the series six year run as Maude's husband, but no where is this more evident when Walter becomes an alcoholic and abuses Maude! In another touching story Walter loses his business and suffers a nervous breakdown.

 Maude of course had several key stories such as deciding whether to have a face lift, to run for government office and coming head to head with guest-star John Wayne, but they all pale into comparison when Susan Harris (future creator of ""SOAP"" and ""Golden Girls"" wrote a two-part story in the show's freshman year when Maude became pregnant and had to decide if she wanted to abort the child. Not surprising many CBS affiliates in the conservative 1970's would not air the two episodes.

 However, personally my favorite episode is the one (you'll have to watch all the shows to find out) if when Vivienne decides to add some spice to her dull married life to Walter. Maude and Walter are arguing with Maude telling Arthur she is going next door to Vivienne's to find out what the hell has been wrong with her as she hasn't called Maude in over a week. Walter tells her to but out but Maude says...she's my friend so there....go to hell!"" In the nest scene Maude and Walter are standing outside Vivienne and Arthur's door and ring the door bell. Vivienne runs to the door dressed only in surranwrap and says ""Kiss me Arthur!"". She then opens her eyes and screams seeing Maude and Walter. The one scene had the longest laugh in the show's history! Don't miss it!

 A great series and simply a wonderful DVD set to add to your collection. Cannot wait for March 17th  to arrive!!!",1421452800,19,3889,4.669106881405564

6872630,5,B00QJN33Q0,"It's been nearly eight years since the stand-alone Season One release from Sony, but the saviours of Classic TV at Shout Factory have finally made one of my TV dreams come true by announcing the release of MAUDE: THE COMPLETE SERIES on DVD in 2015!

Of the nearly 100 TV series that line my entertainment center shelves, this one is going to be the crowing jewel. The 1972-78 CBS Emmy-winning comedy heavyweight from prolific creator Norman Lear is without a doubt my favorite television show of all-time and it has been an absolute joy to relive all 141 episodes commercial-free and uncut (Shout was amazingly able to clear all music for this release so there are no omissions/substitutions).

When ""Maude"" premiered in 1972, Lear was on a roll with ""Sanford and Son"" and of course, the series in which the Maude character first appeared, Lear's flagship series ""All in the Family"". As Edith Bunker's ultra-liberal, feisty, outspoken cousin, the four-times-married Maude was the perfect counterpoint for Archie Bunker and her guest spot was so successful that with much persuasion Lear was able to get stage actress Beatrice Arthur to take on the role as a weekly series. The feminist movement was in full swing, Helen Reddy was singing ""I Am Woman"" and the series premiered at the perfect time.

Never before had audiences seen a leading lady so ballsy, brassy, opinionated and loud (to name just a few traits; the irressistibly-catchy theme song by Donny Hathaway spelled out all the rest). Like it's parent show, MAUDE was a series that wasn't afraid to tackle issues. In the ninth episode aired, the forty-seven-year-old Maude discovers she's pregnant and the abortion issue is raised in a two-parter that had sponsors panicking and angry viewers penning protest letters to the network. But abortion was only the beginning: the series also tackled marijuana use, alcoholism, spousal abuse, homosexuality, wife-swapping, bi-polar disorder, suicide, death, adultery and more. The cast of seasoned stage performers including Bill Macy, Rue McClanahan, Adrienne Barbeau and Conrad Bain effortlessly ebb and flow between the serious and the hysterically funny bits in each script. The topicality is much more evident in the early seasons; as the show progresses, it's toned down somewhat and it's pure comedy in the later years.

I can honestly say there are only about three clunkers in the entire series run and even those aren't as bad as you may think. ""Captain Hero"" fails because of the silly premise and guest star John Byner; ""Speed Trap"" puts Walter and Arthur in the spotlight and without Maude the show suffers; ""The Flying Saucer"" is a cash-in on 1977's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and it's just not believable that someone as level-headed as Maude would believe in UFOs. Other than those, this series is a definite winner from beginning to end. Bea is brilliant in the role. Her stage presence is incredible, her timing impeccable. Some of the best moments are those pregnant pauses when she holds back a zinger just long enough and you know it's coming, and yet never disappoints. Syndicators found these pauses an easy edit to trim time so it's going to be great to have them all restored here. No one could deliver an icy, withering glare or slam a door like Maude Findlay and those long vests of hers are a hilarious reminder of '70s bad fashion.

Bill Macy as Walter comes across as the typical hen-pecked husband but his performance matches Bea's and you can't help but cheer when he occasionally bellows ""Maude, SIT!!!"" and she obeys. Bodacious Adrienne Barbeau is a delight as Carol and it's great to see how Conrad Bain's Arthur gets under Maude's skin. Rue McClanahan's role here as ditsy Vivian isn't as much fun as her future turn as Blanche Devereaux on ""The Golden Girls"", but the several Lucy-and-Ethelesque moments she shares with Maude are laugh-out-loud worthy (""The Game Show"" from Season Five is an absolute must-see with the two actresses so in-synch there must have been electricity in the air the night of the taping). Of the three housekeepers Maude employs over the series' run, I prefer the cynical, hard-drinking Mrs. Naugatuck (Hermione Baddeley) followed by wise-cracking, sharp Florida (Esther Rolle). Maude's third and final maid, Victoria (Marlene Warfield) doesn't make much of a splash in the show although the episode that introduces her (""The New Maid"") is a standout.

MAUDE is a thoroughly enjoyable, satisfying ride all the way and includes guest appearances by then up-and-coming actors such as Jill Clayburgh, Michael Keaton, Bernadette Peters and Terri Garr to big stars like John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Van Johnson and Eve Arden as well as sitcom veterans like Conchata Ferrell, Richard Deacon, Carole Cook, Richard Stahl, James Coco, Philip Bruns, Vincent Gardenia, Ed Begley, Jr., Arthur Peterson, John Hillerman, Audra Lindley, Graham Jarvis, Ron Glass, Helen Martin, Fred Grandy, Darryl Hickman, Judith Lowry, Arlene Golonka, Sudie Bond, Herb Edelman, Robert Mandan, Alice Ghostley, Mary-Louise Wilson, Marcia Rodd (who orginally had the role of Carol in the pilot), Jack Dodson, Richard Kline, Roscoe Lee Brown, James Cromwell, Charles Siebert, Barbara Rhoades, J. Pat O'Malley, Dick Van Patten, Conrad Janis, Michael O'Keefe, William Schallert, Charles Lane, Eugene Roche, Mary-Jo Catlett, Nanette Fabray, Priscilla Morrill, Phil Leeds, Lyle Waggoner and Tom Bosley.

To sweeten the pot even more, Shout has unearthed two UNAIRED EPISODES from the Sony Vault which were scrapped, reshot and aired later (""Double Standard"" and ""Arthur's Friends"") and these are a fascinating, rare treat for those fans who thought they'd seen it all! The glossy episode booklet/guide is very detailed and contains some full-page color and black-and-white cast photos some of which I have NEVER seen before (and I've collected MAUDE press and publicity pics since 1992).

The video quality is better than I've ever seen it in reruns (check out the screen grabs I posted in the IMAGES section and see for yourself).

Thank you again Shout Factory for FINALLY giving MAUDE her due. You've made the fans (especially this one) VERY happy with this news! Yes, I was the one who uploaded an episode to Youtube with annotations all over it to email Shout and request MAUDE on DVD. Hey, it worked and I'm not sorry :)

I'd pay five-hundred-bucks for this and give this TEN STARS if I could! Now please bring on ONE DAY AT A TIME and IT'S A LIVING!",1417824000,90,6488,5.049486461251167

6872698,5,B00QJN33Q0,Wonderful set.,1482278400,,14,6.5
6872699,5,B00QJN33Q0,"I was a kid when this show aired, I remember how much Worse the make-it-cheap-dammit 30min sitcoms looked, shot (inexcusably) on Sony videotape as throw-aways - there wasn't even cable TV when they made the decision, syndication was Daytime TV, and who-cares-about-them?

I also had the misfortune of having to work with these 'masters' years later, what a disgusting, interlaced, train-wreck.

I dunno how Shout! does it, but the picture here is FanTasTic given how the TV studio/owners treated this material. If you expect Anything, you obviously weren't there. If you wanted to see the shows enough to have purchased the Sony single season, you know that applying Minimum Effort resulted in Minimum Product, i.e., the Sony version (Mill Creak) is eye-blurringly unwatchable.. and gasp- Still Interlaced. It is the definition of Sony's Painfuly and Famously lame efforts on the DVD front.

Enter a corrected-beyond-what-we-thought-possible rendition from Shout!. I state here, for the record: If Shout! releases most anything that the (bleah! ARrgh) studios/owners have been Sitting On for Decades, I'll be in line to buy it. It can not be high def, but they at least have a Firm understanding of what it takes to make them Watchable.  If you grew up on DVDs or better, you will probably wonder how us old folks ever watched TV period. If you have survived VHS-days, you will be Impressed with this collection (and Shout!'s others, notably WKRP).

I won't go into how this show was the definitive alter-ego to All in the Family, far-left personalities need not apply as this made fun of them like AitF made fun of the right, informative and enjoyable, whether you Like the Maude character or Not.

Christmas sale brought this in under $70, a reach for my budget, so I thought I should put out a rave, glad I spent the money!",1481932800,9,1826,4.931596091205212

6872702,1,B00QJN33Q0,"First, I will say that Bea Arthur is awesome and this show is very, very funny.  My problem with it is that the writers seem to think that no dialog exists unless it is SCREAMED FROM ONE CHARACTER TO ANOTHER.
You have your choice of episodes: The one where Maude argues with Walter, the one where Walter argues with Arthur, the one where Arthur argues with Vivian, and on and on and on.
So, again, it really is funny more often than not, but expect a pounding headache after you watch an episode or two.",1478563200,,503,4.294736842105263

6872709,5,B00QJN33Q0,"I really think Maude was the funniest show ever on TV, and Bea Arthur the funniest person, male or female, ever on TV.  How's that for a definitive statement?  She could make you laugh with the slightest arching of an eyebrow and she had incredible comedy timing.  All these years later Maude is still hilarious, primarily because of her, but the rest of the cast are also superb.  Like a lot of people i got the first season on DVD when it was released and then waited for the rest....  I've just ordered this box set and can't wait to get them.

I have 2 favourite moments from all of Maude:  One was when she and Walter were having a fight and she paused and said ""Walter, there's a thin line between love and hate.  And you're erasing it.""  I don't know who wrote that line but it's always stuck with me as one of the funniest lines ever.  The other one is when Walter has left Maude and moved into his swinging bachelor apartment building and Maude goes with Vivian and Arthur to see him and knocks on the wrong apartment door.  The guy opens the door - he's an african american man - takes a look at her and says ""You ain't young enough, you ain't short enough and you ain't dark enough"" and slams the door in her face.  Maude then just stares at the door for a few seconds, then looks back at the camera/audience, then looks *back* at the door again (and the audience goes crazy), then looks back at the camera and says ""Well, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"", then looks *back* at the door *again*!  I don't know exactly why, but this scene is just hysterically funny, thanks to the comedy genius of Bea Arthur.  Only she could have done that scene and made it that funny.

I got to see her once live in concert, very late in her career, and she was a little frail by that time, but it was nice to have been in her presence anyway.  It's about time the entire 6 seasons (plus the extras) were released for us Maude maniacs!",1468195200,2,1966,4.230563002680965
6872710,5,B00QJN33Q0,This is a great set.  It has some interesting extras as well (such as a few unaired episodes and also the all in the family episodes with Maude in them).  I also want to add that you should be careful when buying this set from secondary sellers since there are fairly good bootlegs of this set out there.  I had to order this set twice in here since the first set I received new from a seller on here was a bootleg and I found out too late.,1464825600,,440,3.977272727272727

6872716,5,B00QJN33Q0,I'm only 51 so I was about 10 or 11 when sometimes my mom would let me stay up late to watch Maude with her. Even at that young age I remember laughing hysterically. When that memory popped into my head one day while surfing Amazon I checked and sure enough there it was...the whole series box set.  Before I bought this I was a little worried about the quality of the transfer because past experience has taught me that sometimes the stuff from the 70's transfers poorly. My worry was unfounded. The transfer is perfect and Maude is still hilarious after all these decades. I'm so glad I bought it.,1452729600,6,599,4.396396396396397

6872718,5,B00QJN33Q0,"I love the Maude box set, but has anyone else experienced this problem: In every episode, for a few seconds at a time, a pink stripe shows up at the top left of the screen. Then it disappears... then comes back again. I've watched about 15 episodes so far and it's happened several times. The rest of the picture looks great, and the pink stripe is only at the top corner of the screen but it's still distracting nevertheless.

Other than that, great show, great box. I have to say, though, that even though it's a minor mistake, in the booklet article, Conrad Bain is listed as playing ""Walter"" Harmon, instead of Arthur Harmon. It seems rather perplexing that nobody would have caught a simple mistake like that.

Did anyone else notice, though, that in the first 2 episodes of Season 2, Walter quits drinking due to realizing he's an alcoholic, but then several episodes later, it shows him pouring vodka again? Did they just ignore that, or were the episodes perhaps shown out of order? I haven't watched any episodes past that to know whether he drinks in later seasons.

I have enjoyed watching Bea and Rue McClanahan performing together 10 years or so before they co-starred in ""Golden Girls."" The quality of the writing is superb with an actual vocabulary.

The only thing I had failed to remember about the show was how everyone seemed to shout at each other most of the time.

6872760,5,B00QJN33Q0,"""Maude"" wasn't shown in the UK at the time it was being shown in the US,though I did see a version with Elaine Stritch but been so long,I can't really remember it.
I saw ""Maude"" while on holiday in the US and was surprised to see as well as Bea Arthur,Rue McClanahan in the cast,they work so well together here as outspoken Maude and the shy,retiring Vivian,who marries the pompous Dr  Arthur Harman,played so well by Conrad Bain.
Special praise must go to Bill Macy as the long suffering Walter,who can only make maude stop and listen by screaming ""Maude,sit!"".

I really liked Esther Rolle as the no nonsense,wise cracking Florida Evans who spun off to the successful ""Good Times"" and the ater housekeeper Mrs Naugatuck,played so very well by Hermoine Baddeley(sister of Angela, Mrs Bridges in ""Upstairs,Downstairs"" fame)the feuds between Maude and Mrs Naugatuck were legendary. In the last series the housekeeper was Victoria.(Marlene Warfield)
The voice of reason in the Findlay household is Carol played by Adrienne Barbeau,who is a warm friendly presence there with her young son Phillip(Brian Morrison then in the last series,Kraig Metzinger).

Shout Factory have done a great job with this DVD set,the booklet on the show is terrific,great to have all of this great show on DVD plus the two unaired episodes and the two Bea Arthur guest spots on ""All In The Family"",I never tire of the great theme tune and as the song goes ""Right On Maude!"".",1429142400,,1450,4.8861788617886175

6872767,5,B00QJN33Q0,"Bea Arthur is without a doubt, one of the best actresses to hit the airwaves, and shines in this TV series as the fiesty, liberal Maude Findlay. Here, you get all 6 seasons of the show, along with 2 unaired episodes of Maude, and 2 original episodes of ""All in the Family"". The controversial topics covered in Norman Lears classics set the way for the open minded, welcoming society we are today. These topics, however, could never be covered today by people being ""offended"" so easily by people breathing the wrong way. I have to say, that although The Golden Girls is, and will always be my favorite show, I still love Bea Arthur & Rue McClanahan in this series as well. Bill Macy couldn't have been a better pick for Walter (Maude's Fourth Husband), and Adrienne Barbeau as Carol. I am so glad to own this classic, and anyone who has any appreciation for classic television should! I would give this TEN stars if I could! Get it! I paid $100 for it! So far, I am only in the middle of Season 2, but the quality is near blu-ray! Love this wonderful show!",1428105600,5,1056,4.420512820512821

6872771,5,B00QJN33Q0,"I absolutely love this series and Shout Factory did a marvelous job.  I couldn't wait to watch the episode from Season three -""Nostaglia Party"" with Aunt Polly(played marvelously by Judith Lowry, known for her role  as Mother Dexter on ""Phyllis"" a few years later).  The ending scene was never shown in syndication and was hilarious.  I never realized there were short ""tag"" scenes at the end of these earlier episodes.  Also, seeing the episodes as they were originally broadcast was a delight, without commercials.  (I always was annoyed at the way they would insert a commercial after a big laugh at the beginning of the show and then resume somewhere in the middle. It spoiled the continuity.)  The extras included are great as well. Billy Macy was a bit emotional when talking about one of the scenes he had to do with Bea Arthur.  Don't miss it !",1426896000,15,852,4.70945945945946
6872772,5,B00QJN33Q0,"I am so grateful for the complete series of Maude. Emmy winning Beatrice Arthur plays the liberal feminist Maude Findlay of Tuckahoe, New York. She lives in a fine home in wealthy Westchester County with her fourth husband, Walter (played brilliantly by Bill Macy); her divorced daughter Carol (played by Adrienne Barbeau) and conservative neighbor, Arthur (played by Conrad Bain). There are other cast members like Maude's best friend, Vivian (played by Rue McClanahan). See Bea and Rue before they were Dorothy and Blanche on ""The Golden Girls"" ten years later. You can't forget Esther Rolle's performance as the family housekeeper, Florida Evans, before she went to star in her own Norman Lear series, ""Good Times."" She was replaced by eccentric Mrs Naugituck (played beautifully by the late actress Hermione Baddeley).

Finally the complete series is all here with extras. I just got it today and it's a great gift for comedy fans. I still prefer Bea and Rue before they became the Golden Girls in the eighties.",1426896000,4,1015,5.041666666666667

I have been waiting almost 8 years for more than Season 1 which was released by Sony in 2007 for the 35th anniversary of the first show. Well it arrived and I must say it was worth the wait. The quality of the video and audio is first class. The colors are vibrantly done. The episodes appear uncut including scenes I don't recall from past syndication attempts, especially the short scenes prior to the ending credits. Most if not all of those short scenes were cut from syndication. Also, I remember in syndication many moments at the beginning of a scene were cut out. Gladly none of those edits or cuts are here in this set. This show was ground-breaking and hilarious. Beatrice Arthur was simply so funny and had some of the best comedy timing ever on TV. It comes with a  booklet of the show's history and a complete episode guide list. Also it comes with a bonus disc featuring 2 previously unaired episodes that were later redone for additional seasons. Also included are some bonus video material. A great value for one of the best classic TV shows of all time. Treat yourself to fun, laughter and great comedy.

The cast was fantastic! Beatrice Arthur as Maude, Bill Macy as her husband, Adrienne Barbeau as her daughter, Rue McClanahan as her ditzy best friend, and the incomparable Conrad Bain as her Republican neighbor. Also Ester Rolle as maid #1, Hermione Baddeley as maid #2, and J. Pat O'Malley as the latter's husband.

Many guest stars: Robert Mandan in 3 shows, Helen Page Camp in several episodes, Herb Edelman in a couple, James Cromwell in a couple, John Amos in a couple, Barbara Rush, Martin Balsam, and even the voice of Jimmy Carter in the final episode.
