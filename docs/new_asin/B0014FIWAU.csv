8255557,5,B0014FIWAU,"I watched this movie on Hulu Japan and really enjoyed it, because the story was so good. Kappa are mythical Japanese creatures. A fossilized kappa is found by a boy, and brought to life again. His family adopts the kappa, and the resulting story is both funny and moving. The price here on Amazon seems prohibitively expensive, and that's a shame because this is a movie that many people would enjoy.",1376265600,4,400,4.647887323943662
