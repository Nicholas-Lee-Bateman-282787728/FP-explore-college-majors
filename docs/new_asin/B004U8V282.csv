8441321,5,B004U8V282,"The sick and twisted swan song to an already sick and twisted program. Tim and Eric go all-out to make this the most nonsensical and offensive that Awesome Show! can be. Most of the regulars make an appearance here in some form or another (the unfortunate exception being the late Richard Dunn). Closure is finally given to some of the more popular skits. It's sad seeing something as surreal as Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! ending, but it went out with a bang and left the fans a treasure to watch every Chrimbus.",1398643200,8,523,4.515789473684211

Best holiday special ever. The musical numbers, the dancing, really gets you into the holiday spirit.

Be sure to keep your Chrimbus Bush trim and wet!",1388707200,10,186,4.4411764705882355
