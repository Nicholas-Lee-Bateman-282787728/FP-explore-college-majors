basically this movie is surrounded by young singer on romeo's record label forest lipton. its just a long music video.... the girl can sing though... i just wish they did not make her sing so much in the movie... if i wanted to see all kinds of singing i would watch dreamgirls again...

this movie is good for children that like childish humor...
