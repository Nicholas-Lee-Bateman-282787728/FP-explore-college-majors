222653,5,630018868X,"This movie is my all time favorite comedy western!  I laughed so hard about one seen that I almost made myself ill, but I won't give that away.  I would love to own it in DVD.",1131062400,7,175,3.8333333333333335
222654,4,630018868X,"if you're a fan of 'b' westerns, check this one out. it's light non-gory entertainment.
handsome harry holland (douglas) is an aging gunfighter working his way down to mexico to hang'em up. his plan hits a snag when his particular sense of fair play lands him in trouble, and he has to hole up in the hotel with, what else, a beautiful blonde hostage.
the town sends for the reknown lawman, sam starrett (coburn), without realizing that sam has aged just as much handsome harry, and has fallen into the bottle, to boot.
(will starrett be able to take the measure of holland? sorry, i couldn't resist)
this is an amiable, medium-paced western. it was probably fun for the cast to film. it is certainly not peckenpaugh, ford, leone, or eastwood. it's more like the atmosphere of 'the war wagon'. it's worth a look-see. and does the fastest gun win in the end? you'll see.",1049846400,7,869,4.612903225806452

7804657,5,630018868X,"Comedy Westerns are hard to beat, especially ones with real star power like this one.

This is one of my favorite Westerns. Kirk Douglas & James Coburn are perfect as a couple of over-the-hill gunfighters; one a has-been bank robber & the other an ex-lawman who's traded in his sixgun for a bottle of tequila.

Draw! is a beautifully-made, well-directed Western with great performances by an A-list cast, a droll script, fine cinematography & an evocative score. From the exciting opening sequence to the satisfying ending, it pays homage to traditional Westerns, with lots of familiar Western tropes, and along the way some genuinely funny scenes & memorable performances.

Douglas is excellent as always & Coburn is especially good as the thirsty, washed-up sheriff brought in to face down Douglas, who's holed-up in a hotel room with a beautiful actress, played by the lovely Alexandra Bastedo. Graham Jarvis as the earnest deputy is also memorable.

Made in 1984, this was one of Douglas & Coburn's last movies. But though it was late in their careers, they were still more than able to carry off a wonderful comedy-action Western with a style & screen presence rarely seen today.

Even at low-res VHS quality, this movie gets better every time I see it. Why it hasn't been released on DVD is a mystery!

I'd buy it in a heartbeat.",1463097600,2,1335,4.859030837004405
7804658,5,630018868X,"Good story line, About two ageing gun fighters. A well done movie. Want to find in DVD. Why don't we have it in our own country? Is it too much to ask?",1439337600,,151,3.75

7804660,5,630018868X,"A very likeable western and the twisty plot is very good! Kirk Douglas and James Coburn at their best. The leading lady is beautiful and smart! This is a very, very good movie! I have seen many westerns, this one ifs far from average!",1432771200,,234,4.340909090909091
7804661,5,630018868X,An entertaining movie with good actors and light-hearted plot.  I'll bet they had a great time making this movie.  I sure wish they'd release it on dvd!,1406764800,,152,4.592592592592593
7804662,5,630018868X,"This is a great movie. It was funny and unpredictable. I like when I cannot guess what will happen next. I thought it was creative how they put real life comedy in a serious western. If you like Westerns and the 3 great actors in this movie, you just may love this movie too.",1392681600,2,275,4.111111111111111
7804663,5,630018868X,"I watch a lot of movies, and most of them wind up on ""the cutting room floor"" in my memory bank after I've seen them.  This one, however, was one that really stuck in my mind (and it's been about 25 years since I've seen it).  It should be correctly categorized as a spoof on the traditional western. There isn't anything serious about it, so if you are looking for a hard-core western, forget it.  The cast includes two of my all-time favorite actors.  There were a number of scenes, and some of the dialog, that cracked me up laughing.  And the trick ending is worth the price of admission.  I think it is available on NetFlix, if you don't want to pay the outrageous prices asked for on this site.",1373846400,,700,4.305343511450381
7804664,5,630018868X,"Draw! [VHS] - product was shipped very fast, in fact, the seller shipped it with a faster rate at his own cost to get it to me. this was great because I really wanted to see this movie again. But as you know things go, didn't get time to watch it right away. The quality of the tape was good. at first the picture kept jumping (and this vcr was on that didn't have the adjustments for tracking on it, supposed to do it automatically). but I just did a fast forward on the tape and then rewind and played it and it was very good.
Very good movie.",1348704000,,545,4.009174311926605
7804665,5,630018868X,I really enjoyed this western and how can you beat a cast of Kirk Douglas and  James Coburn. With all the junk coming out on dvd today why is there no room for this really fun western on dvd?,1319760000,4,191,3.8974358974358974
