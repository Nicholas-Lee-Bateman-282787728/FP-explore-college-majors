8446001,5,B004X2TSPY,"My son is in grade six and has severe dysgraphia that has been undiagnosed until this year.  He has seen an occupational therapist for a year for fine motor issues.  Within two weeks of the program he has begun to write paragraphs and all of his math lines up in columns.  Before this program he had to use graph paper and his math was such a mess he couldn't read his numbers.  He also couldn't edit or correct his writing because he couldn't actually read what he wrote.  In just two weeks of diligent effort combined with the brain training manual by Dianne Craft he has made an eighty percent improvement in his written output.  We are looking forward to seeing where he will be in six months of regular work on the exercises.  It is a lot of work and the exercises are boring, but he notices the difference in how he feels and how he is able to write that he reminds us that it is time to do his exercises.  For students with severe dysgraphia I would also recommend her right brain exercise book for spelling as well.  Now when he sits to write he actually uses two hands, one to hold the paper at the correct midline position and the other to write with because writing is a two handed exercise.",1470700800,5,1202,4.306666666666667
8446002,5,B004X2TSPY,"We were recommended this by a specialist in dysgraphia and it is a really wonderful programme to use. It is so easy to work with, and I have found that my son's writing has improved a lot in terms of letter formation. It is a multisensory type system and this means that children really need to participate and feel actively involved and engaged.

Such a clever system, and well worth the money to buy as it makes such a huge difference!",1432339200,4,437,4.395061728395062
8446003,4,B004X2TSPY,"I'm not a big fan of video lecture, but it was the only way this depth of info was available. The excercise seems valid but I work with high school students and they are highly resistant to try things that take effort.",1429142400,2,218,4.214285714285714
8446004,5,B004X2TSPY,"Read about this after ""googling"" kids who hate to write.  The struggles that were pointed out fit my son to a T!  My son is 13 and has struggled for years.  Very frustrating that I found the help needed by using the computer after all the years of appointments & therapy sessions. We are just starting to use the curriculum but I am determined to stick with it and see what changes we see. I'm hopeful as always.",1419552000,4,412,4.256410256410256
8446005,5,B004X2TSPY,Thank You Dianne for doing what you do!,1410393600,,39,4.0
8446006,5,B004X2TSPY,"Dianne Craft explains the exercise that helps a child overcome the symptoms of dysgraphia. My daughter couldn't write within the lines and used a mixture of capital and lower case letters. After a few weeks, her letters are much smaller and she uses lower case letters more often. This exercise works!",1388620800,9,301,4.921568627450981
