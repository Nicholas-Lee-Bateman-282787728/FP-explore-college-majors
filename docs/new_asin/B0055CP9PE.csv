4573913,5,B0055CP9PE,"This was a gift for my dad this christmas!
He loves nature shows. As a child we grew up watching Wild Kingdom! This collections is great! We have collection 1 and just had to add to the series. This gift box has such a vivid pic of the wolf that you cant stop looking at him! The DVD's are loaded with beautiful shots of nature you will have hours of enjoyable watching.",1356998400,8,370,4.152777777777778
4573914,4,B0055CP9PE,"Technically this 5 Disc set is up to date.
Seems the main features were captured in the Hi-Res IMAX format,
then converted to stunning 1920 x 1080p format.  Nice job.
The audio is Dolby 5.1 surround or stereo.
Yes, ....you can hear the Earthquakes & Wind Storms like it's in your house.
.
If you have seen the features before, this might not be your choice.",1354924800,9,357,4.409090909090909
4573915,4,B0055CP9PE,"I just received this yesterday, and it's great to watch. I've not finished with it yet, so far it's good so far. Some of the discs are what I want to watch, but there's couple of them are almost over half about humans rather than the cover and names for the videos. I would rate them 5 stars if it was not for that. I love to watch wild life videos, but these with people, Dr. so and so,or wildlife protection agent so and so, and so forth. They always tend to interfere and it stays with that person for a long while. But, some of the discs are great to watch because they're all about wildlife instead of people interfering. I like this set, and you will too. I'm pretty much enjoying this video set so far regardless of with a couple of them with so and so interfering. I like it and I recommend that you get this video set. It's a 10 discs set and for a amazon price, you'll be happy with it like I am.",1352592000,37,906,4.038888888888889

4573919,4,B0055CP9PE,"Most of these documents were on Netflix. There all old episodes like one was from 1999 or maybe older.

Other than that the documentaries are great if u just love animals and nature..just want to see them be...it's great for that.

Ship talk... don't know who failed on this part all parties are to blame, but when i opened the box the dvds were all over the place. So you know what means!!!! Scratched  dvds =(

4573923,5,B0055CP9PE,First Nat Geo DVD set I have ever bought. Halfway through it and it is very amazing. I also like how the discs have hours of extra content and documentaries,1420848000,,156,4.233333333333333

4573926,5,B0055CP9PE,"I bought this for a 4 year old grandson thinking it might be over his head, turns out it was a perfect family present, everyone in the family has watched this a number of times and it was a big hit.  4 yr old is particularly proud of the fact that everyone loves HIS video so much!",1392508800,8,281,3.9298245614035086
4573927,2,B0055CP9PE,Thought it would be longer on each story one hour per disk it cost to much for that seriously NG!!!,1392076800,,99,4.0
4573928,4,B0055CP9PE,"I bought this video set for the whole family to watch as we are lovers of nature. The videos are well done and tell a story of each animal  in that moment in time, the family dynamics as well as the survival strategies used to survive. We all enjoyed the BBC series and these feel close to those.",1391990400,2,296,4.103448275862069

4573930,5,B0055CP9PE,you can't beat National Geogrphic for quality and once again not disappointed. dvd series is excellent would recommend to anyone who loves nature,1388966400,,145,5.3478260869565215
4573931,5,B0055CP9PE,"This set covers more than half the world from the western prairie of the US where wolves and bison run again, then to the west coast to Big Sur and Climbing Redwood Giants, then on to the oceans with great white sharks. followed by Africa with prides of lions and rhino rescue. Next we go to India with Return of Clouded Leopards and next to Patagonia in the southern tip of South America, where we meet Guanacos, Penguins, Pumas. Elephant Seals, Parrots, Right Whales, Dolphins, Sea Lions, Albatrosses and Orcas. This is the longest segment of the set and the most interesting and it had not one but two female commentators. To conclude we meet the Giant Bears of Kodiak Island in Alaska. It took me an entire day  to watch the DVDs and I learned a lot in the process.
I have just one minor complaint about the packaging of the set: I think it could go around the world without any damage to its heavy plastic case, but once you open the case it is nearly impossible to get the disks out without using a hammer. I put them all in thin plastic cases to get to them faster.",1381622400,23,1072,4.333333333333333
4573932,5,B0055CP9PE,"You can see most all of these on PBS, but here it is a lot easier to watch. We do like the nature stuff",1376179200,3,103,3.3333333333333335
4573933,5,B0055CP9PE,This product presents documentary films true to the genre. Animal life is explained unbiased and in an interesting way. I learned a lot and enjoyed it.,1372118400,,151,4.846153846153846
4573934,4,B0055CP9PE,"These DVD's are awesome! If you love nature and National Geographic, then this is great! I think the ONLY thing that brings it down a star, is that each dvd is only an hour long. I would have loved if there were more on each",1366329600,6,224,4.0
4573935,5,B0055CP9PE,Excellent NatGeo collection.  At the discounted price the 10-disc set was a steal.  Rise of Black Wolf is worth the price of the set alone... awesome documentary.,1365724800,,162,4.962962962962963
8458056,3,B0055CP9PE,"Although a typical mix of NG videos where some focus more on the locals or a personality instead of nature, for the cost of the set (even off a secondary seller) the case is beyond abysmal.

This set is contained in a paper slipcase with a typical multi-fold insert where one DVD partially covers another; however, there aren't any central hole posts.

Yes, you read that right.

--- There aren't any posts that go through the central hole of a disc. ---

Instead there are springy ears molded into the clear plastic facing of each overlapped ''page'' of the set insert, I guess intended to secure the edge of a disc in concert with a space left for a small portion of each discs bottom edge.

Obviously this doesn't work very well at all, and my set arrived with multiple discs all stacked atop one another as if many were missing.

A few discs had suffered slight edge damage or surface scratching but so far all have played at least once. Given the insane full cost however, this packaging format can hardly have done NG any favors with people who otherwise might've contemplated future purchases.

I currently have the discs in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Disc-DVD-Case-with-5-Flip-Trays-and-Outer-Clear-Sleeve/dp/B009CEX174/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Disc DVD Case with 5 Flip Trays and Outer Clear Sleeve</a>&nbsp;along with March of the Penguins, and as an added bonus this better case fits inside the National Geographic set slipcover. In the future I'll probably split up the set into 4- or 6-DVD cases along with other similar single NG episodes floating about the video shelves.",1527465600,,1644,5.251908396946565
