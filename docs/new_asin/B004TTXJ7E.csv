8440947,2,B004TTXJ7E,"I paid a mere $2.00 for this at Target, and basically got my money's worth. The editing is poor (e.g., the narrator will be talking about a land campaign but the screen will be showing U-boats in action), and the film repeats many of the same images over and over again.

The Russian Revolution is completely ignored (the narrator only tells us that the war in the East has ended), and the entire production has an amateur feel to it.

The picture at times was buckling or was wavy near the top of the screen, which was somewhat distracting.

For a capsule narration, it's not that bad however - some of the keys highlights and personalities of the war are mentioned, so this could serve as an introduction to someone with little or no knowledge of WW1.

For two bucks I really can't complain, but I won't be watching this very weak production ever again.",1311811200,6,855,4.496774193548387
