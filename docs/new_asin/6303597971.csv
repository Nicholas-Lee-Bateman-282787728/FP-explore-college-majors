7851921,4,6303597971,The seller was very friendly and fun to with.  I highly recommend this seller and would not hesitate to purchase from her again.,1275436800,,128,4.565217391304348
7851922,1,6303597971,"This thing is a joke. The audio and video quality are horrible, there are no instructions other than a visual run through of a handful of riffs (once at normal speed and once at 1/2 speed), and, I'm sorry, HAND WRITTEN tab?

This looks like it was done for a highschool project.",1116460800,,278,4.346153846153846
7851923,1,6303597971,"To say the Curt Mitchell `teaches' is a vast overstatement, he merely plays riff after riff - never really saying too much about finger placement, picking technique or anything in the way of instruction. Teaching is much more than `watch this'. His discussion of Jimi's effect and amp settings is just as disappointing, In reality he just shows us the gear he himself uses, such as graphite bridge saddles (not available in Hendrix's time), and provides us with such uncertain comments as: ""Jimi didn't use the middle pickup much... I think?"" Included with this tape is HAND WRITTEN tab - reproduced to almost unreadable size - that was quite a shock to me given that even though it appears that Mr. Mitchell made this video in his basement, I would still think he might have a computer available to him!?",1024272000,3,805,4.757142857142857
7851924,4,6303597971,"There is so much that is cheesy about the movie: the cover design, the production values.  But Mitchell does a good job of presenting basic concepts: riffs, patterns, and chords.  There are handwritten tabs (a bit difficult to read).
Mitchell is an enthusiastic player, with entertaining style.  And he has great shoes.
It's too bad the quality of the video (sound & image) is not more professional.  It really doesn't do itself justice.",996105600,7,437,4.945205479452055
7851925,1,6303597971,"This movie is simply bad.  I looks like some stupid high school project!  The picture quality is terrible, and so is the sound.  The riffs were refered to as #1, #2, #3, etc.  I don't think this movie would be helpful to either a beginner or advanced guitarist.  Each riff was only played twice, the instructor did not explain how to do them (what, they think we're going to look at the screen for a total of 10 seconds for each riff and learn it???), the film shows that the instructor did not have much rehearsing, and it's extremely boring.  I didn't find this movie helpful what so ever.",991094400,3,591,4.376146788990826
7851926,4,6303597971,"The production is real simple, the notes are very crude, and Curt Mitchell is not a polished trainer/performer, but there is probably no better way for most Hendrix fans to learn the fundamental keys to Jimi's guitar style.  I've spent years trying to figure out most of these riffs and chord  progressions by ear, with bad results - I'm just not good at that.  I've  had several wasted lessons with ""experts"" who knew less than I  did.  In just one hour with this tape, I learned more about how to play  like Jimi than I did in the last 25 years on my own.  I am really, really  excited, about this tape, and this series.",948240000,9,622,4.339130434782609
7851927,1,6303597971,"It only shows you 1 or 2 riffs from the songs, not  all the riffs and also the solos.  I could have  listened and found out all this video has to offer  by ear.  It is good if you are just starting out but if you are an  intermediate or expert guitar  player, don't buy it.",946339200,2,273,3.767857142857143
