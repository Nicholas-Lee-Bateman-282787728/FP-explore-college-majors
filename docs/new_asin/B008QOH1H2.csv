5178459,5,B008QOH1H2,I've been wanting to see it since the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was surprised it made its way onto amazon. The movie is about a seedy club that is long past its heyday and the characters the interact within it. It has a heavy slice of comedy but it is also a crime film. I am reminded somewhat of Tarantino when I watch this film; any fan of his will most certainly enjoy this movie.,1351555200,4,387,4.105263157894737

5178464,3,B008QOH1H2,"Considering that it didn't seem to mean anything, this was fairly entertaining. Especially if you aren't bothered by little things like trying to milk humor out of cutting up a body with a saw. I'm pretty sure I'll never watch this movie again,but it was worth the one view.",1420761600,,274,4.612244897959184

5178471,4,B008QOH1H2,main character is japanese version of russell crow. an ex gangster who is drawn back to his old ways somewhat set in current times. i love japanese movies of all types and this movie had enough surprises and twists to keep me entertained for 2hrs.,1398988800,,247,4.511111111111111
5178472,1,B008QOH1H2,"Although some people trying to over-exoticize (common for reviews on foreign movies and people who are wannabe movie critics) this flick or over-complicate its meaning, it's really just a poorly constructed, low budget production with almost not redeeming qualities.  Also, the few scenes of really gratuitous violence are pointless and disturbing. A very few light chuckles.",1398816000,,375,5.696428571428571

5178474,3,B008QOH1H2,"The movie was alright, a little slow at times. At times it didn't make no sense, so I  would  say that it wasn't bad or good but sort of the middle of the two. And that is why I gave three stars.",1389657600,,195,3.619047619047619
5178475,5,B008QOH1H2,"I enjoyed watching this movie from beginning till the end, even though I didn't like the ending, but that is what makes the story interesting regardless of how it saddens you. It realistically depicts the beauty of endearing childhood love, the frailty of humanity and the corrupting power of the affluent over the poor, who pay the ultimate price. I believe this still goes on to this date all over the universe as we speak and that is the sad realty this movie clearly shows, in my opinion.",1388016000,,492,4.6022727272727275
5178476,1,B008QOH1H2,It's like a bootleg Guy Ritchie film. The ending so terrible you feel like you wasted 2hrs of your life watching the film,1387843200,2,121,4.304347826086956
5178477,4,B008QOH1H2,"The friend of a nightclub owner seeks refuge with him. The nightclub owner is trying to keep things together, between his expenses, dealing with the local mob, less-than-loyal employees, and now his newly-arrived friend who has an anger-management problem and a fundamental lack of self-preservation. Suffice to say, he's got his hands full.

I'll second the motion to compare this to Tarantino's work.

I would disagree with the idea that this is a comedy of any sort, even a ""dark"" one. And while there were a few places where it was funny, they are more along the lines of Pulp Fiction ""such a surprise instance of a random misfortune"" funny (e.g. when in P.F. they accidentally shot the guy in the car), rather than ""ha ha"" funny.

There's definitely influence from Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, etc. here. ""Gritty"" is a good word to describe this story about a day (or a few) gone bad in the lives of some ex-small-time-gangsters. The raw-but-credible violence, with real characters and relationships, is a page right out of Tarantino's book (well, the one he uses for movies like that, as opposed to e.g. Kill Bill).

The movie fails to fully explain at least one relationship (is she his sister? his estranged-but-still-resident girlfriend?), and ends with at least a couple of loose ends. But these aren't really a problem; if anything, they fit with the jagged edge of reality that the movie is portraying.

There's less than ten or fifteen seconds of laughs tops in this movie, but it's well worth watching for the story and presentation.",1382400000,3,1548,4.893129770992366
5178478,1,B008QOH1H2,Terrible plot. Sad. Bad Camera work.  Just not a good flick at all to watch.  Suggest you pass on  this one.,1374883200,2,108,4.0476190476190474
5178479,5,B008QOH1H2,"After recently going to Japan, I've become obsessed with watching movies in Japanese. I gave this one a shot simply because it was in Japanese and was available on Prime free. Wow! This turned out to be surprisingly very good. It's set in Tokyo and is about how a few different people's lives (a few ex-thugs who own a club, one of their low life employees, his girlfriend, and some members of the Yakuza) cross paths over the course of a day or so, and a few small actions turn out to have huge and unexpected consequences. It sort of reminds me of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but it's much different too. It's engaging from start to finish, and the acting is top notch. I'd love to find more movies with this cast. I'd definitely recommend watching it!",1374624000,,764,4.464285714285714
