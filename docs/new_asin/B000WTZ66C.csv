8225633,5,B000WTZ66C,This dvd has help me so so much. As a working mother of a special needs kids I really need ways to de-stressed to mange the stress levels. Wasn't into eastern medicine however bough this DVD anyway. It is a good summary of de-stressing exercises and technique. Although the yoga sun salutation was good. What surprised me the most how relaxing the tia- chi exercise was. I bought Lucy Loyd-Barkers Beginers Tia Chi DVD as well and that has exceeded my expectations. The presentation  and the production is not fancy. However for a summary of relaxation techniques or introduction I found it to be excellent.,1445299200,,607,4.780952380952381
8225634,4,B000WTZ66C,"I've been really stressed lately because I'm making many changes in my life. Once I get into a good routine I'm sure I'll feel better. In the meantime I'm looking for easy ways to de stress. This DVD is perfect if you want to sample various forms of relaxation.

The program starts with an easy-to-follow Tai Chi routine to calm the nervous system. It is not as complex as other Tai Chi videos I've done in the past. By the end I was really feeling the stress melt away.

Next there is a yoga routine that is quite invigorating. Sun salutations cause you to breathe more deeply. This is followed by a very short section on meditation. It only gives you a small tastes of what is possible.

The last section is about self massage, although it only focuses on the head, neck and shoulders. Also for half ot it you need a partner. It would have been better if they had showed how to massage your own shoulders. It was also easier to do the head massage when lying on your back. No instructions are given for the rest of the body.

Overall, this is a relaxing DVD filled with good ideas. The crashing waves and ocean scenery makes this beautiful. The music is also very pleasant.

I can think of many ways this DVD could be expanded and improved. I especially think there should be an entire section on full-body stretching. But it is what it is and it does help you relax.

If you want to go further with Yoga I can recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Candlelight-Yoga/dp/B00006FMB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Candlelight Yoga</a>

8225635,5,B000WTZ66C,This is a great DVD to unwind at the end of the day.  Get the kinks out of your body and your mind.,1343433600,3,99,3.3043478260869565
8225636,3,B000WTZ66C,"Menu options are only play & chapter choices. The setting is on clip w/beautiful water below on a windy day. Lucy Lloyd-Barker instructs w/voice over in a nice, gentle British accent w/soft music playing. Each chapter starts with a 15 second video of clips of very short videos of random sweet landscapes.
Intro 2 min -
basic
Tai Chi 10 min -
Mostly just standing & feeling your body for several minutes. There are simple stretching arms back & 3 simple movements that are warm-up for Tai Chi Qi Gong in any other class or video for the last couple of minutes. You'd be better off getting ""Discovering Chi"" with Linda Modero to really build enough energy to feel your body healing which I do, or other videos.
Yoga 16 min -
Lucy introduces several poses from Sun Salutation, taking her time to remind you in each pose not to compress your back, where to stretch, keep abs strong, etc. She gives many good details to avoid injury. Once instructed, she puts them together into a quick paced, flowing  vinyasa Sun Salutation to be repeated around 6? times, though she won't announce which pose she's up to or when to breath, but just additional general reminders of keeping good posture, how sun salutations help relax the muscles, etc. Poses include: mountain, standing fwd bends, crescent, child's pose, plank, downward dog, and cobra.
Meditation 2 min -
Basic breathing more slowly, counting & sensing how your body feels. It's over very fast.
Self-massage 8 min -
Done seated, just taping the head, down the arms, chest, shaking out the arms, then massaging by twisting & rubbing to ends of the fingers & flicking off the tension. Massing the scalp, telling you the benefits for hair, flocking w/the fingertips to stimulate the scalp, the smoothing down the scalp, to the shoulders. Simple neck stretches of laying the head in several directions finish the section. A similar & longer self-massage can be found on Gaiam's QiGong for beginners as a bonus ending to the Qi Gong practice.
Head & Shoulder Massage 10 min -
Lucy excels here, doing some great massage strokes LMTs learn in school on a seated woman. Easy to follow, with good camera closeup, she shows kneading, thumb pressure, cirular digital pressure, hacking etc. Couple moves I learned/forgotten:
She lays her forearms on top of the shoulders & does a rolling motion, thumb pressure to the tops of the triceps until the skin is pulled up in a pinching motion. Using palms w/the heel of the hand doing the work, stretch/gently pull the muscles away from the spine. Supporting the woman's head by the forehead, does stroking up both sides of the neck, squeezing/stimulating gently both side of the scalp, then top of the head & neck at the same time, plucking with fingertips to stimulate scalp/blood, sweeping/sliding very gently from forehead down.

To me, the tai chi did not introduce much, the yoga bored me (though great instruction), the meditation too short, the self-massage was nice, and the partner head/shoulder massage great.
