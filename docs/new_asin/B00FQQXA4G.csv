8618028,3,B00FQQXA4G,"I am a confirmed sceptic of all things supernatural, having never witnessed or experienced anything of which I am aware. But, I also have an open mind about most everything and try not to dismiss anything out of hand. Certainly, there are frauds and hucksters out there. I mean, you can't disprove anything many of these people say, so they can say anything - fictional, or factual - and you have to decide for yourself if it's valid or not. I could easily make up a story and write a book about years of phony ghost experiences in my own home. It really depends, in this case, and in the Amityville case (which I believe to be a simple case of a psychopath murdering his family, and nothing more ethereal than that) on whether the author or filmmaker present enough convincing information to make you a believer. Often, too, the frauds will back each other up, because both parties have something to gain from ""confirming"" the other's story. So, I'm always on the lookout for that kind of mutual massaging, as it does set off the BS Meter pretty easily.

Oh - but one note - the background music gets very, very tedious... same few piano notes over and over and over and over....

Bottom line: As far as spending the small amount for this rental, and being a huge fan of The Conjuring (not so much Annabelle, which was a tediously dull money grab), I think this was worth the time and money just to hear the author's side of the story.

Having read and seen a great deal about this story, I personally feel that the author is just a good fiction storyteller with a lot of background info to spin a good yarn and to make a very decent profit from her book and movie deals.",1424995200,3,1672,4.4045307443365695
8618029,5,B00FQQXA4G,I think the this author is very much in her right mind. Those who do not believe either have never had a paranormal experience. Plus it's easy to tell someone they are crazy because it's not happening to them.,1389484800,3,209,4.384615384615385
8618030,1,B00FQQXA4G,"This lady in nuts!!!  She wrote these books for financial gain and makes a dysfunctional family sound like they were influenced by spirits.  She claims some spirits were their own from former reincarnation????  Reincarnation is being reborn again and again after each death as a new person.  This lady states she comes face to face with a past incarnation of herself!!  The lady wrote so much crap in her books, that her family will not read them and gives them back to her.  She acts as if they just could not deal with it, but we need to hear from her family because this lady is so far off the mark.  She makes it sound like her mother was possesed because she read older literature and dressed in black more and more. The problem with this author is that she is not properly dealing with her problems of a broken and dysfunctional family that.  She states that not only were they haunted that all of their family had close encounter with UFOs!!  She is not dealing with a full deck.  I suspect it is a mess of craziness and a mess of ignorance and displaced memories.  Buy at your own risk.",1386633600,3,1094,4.393034825870647
