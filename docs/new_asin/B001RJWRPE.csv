3776993,3,B001RJWRPE,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for the release, so average: 3 stars

The ""Equator"" series is a wonderfully filmed, written and narrated nature series. In quality is matches, if not surpasses, the later and much more hyped ""Planet Earth"", ""Life"" series's. Unfortunately, the producers and/or distributors did not market it as successfully. As to the DVD releases, they also made a few blunders:

1. the cover of these DVDs are too gaudy, it makes one think of them as cheap children films. But they are not; they are professionally made nature shows.
2. they did not release them as a box set. In fact, it is very hard to find all the DVDs in the same series.

There are:
1) Power of an Ocean: The Galapagos and Palmyra ...
2) Battle for the Light: The rainforests of South East Asia ...
3) Rivers of the Sun: The mighty Amazon River ...
4) Paradox of the Andes: In Ecuador the equatorial sun ...
5) Reef of Riches: tropical jungle and on the coral reef ...
6) Challenge of Change > the Great Rift Valley ...

One day I will add all of these to my collection.

Note to Discovery: please release a box set of Bluray DVDs!",1292025600,7,1119,4.360576923076923
3776994,5,B001RJWRPE,"I thought that the cover of this Equator dvd looked a litte childish, like made for kids, but since there is little film on the Amazon I bought it. Man am I glad I did. This program was exactly what I had been looking for. Very good picture quality, very good underwater footage. They focused on a wide variety of animals even some of the small but beautiful and interesting fish. Since then i've purchased the REEF OF RICHES dvd from the Equator series and also just as impressive.",1264550400,12,482,4.426966292134831
3776995,5,B001RJWRPE,Good film focusing on the ebb and flow of the Amazon river (dichotomy dry-wet season). Especially interesting fish species native to the Amazon river with computer graphics added. Some manatee action too. Recommended.,1245888000,6,217,5.606060606060606

8338112,5,B001RJWRPE,I have several of the shows in this series.  It is a quality production with beautiful filming and informative narration.  I had previously seen the show on TV & wanted a copy for myself.,1385856000,,187,4.470588235294118
8338113,5,B001RJWRPE,"It kills me how this Blu-Ray exists as a paradox.  Buying a copy feels like you're rolling the dice, but considering I ran out of Nat Geo and BBC series to own I was desperate for something new, especially something focusing on the Amazon.  This documentary is fascinating.  Tragically, the filmmakers didn't create multiple episodes, lacks the mini-series quality, you know, like Planet Earth or Life (as far as I'm concerned, the benchmark for nature documentaries).  Instead, this is an individual, singular documentary.  So you get, like, an hour worth of filming.  I know, not much, but it's worth it.

This is exceptionally well-made, considering the obvious budget shortfalls. The only two areas where this documentary falls short is on the God-awful soundtrack, which I can't emphasize the importance of having a great score to reign the viewer emotions and sell the drama--but BE SUBTLE and don't skimp; invest in, you know, an orchestra or at the very least license some classical music. I think the managerial notion that predicates this decision is that the soundtrack is the part of the production where the team can recoup their expenses; an unfortunate rookie mistake.

The other facet that kills me is the box art.  This is one of the worst box-art direction I've ever seen in a nature documentary. This is fairly compared to the exquisite quality content found within the series.  The director should be embarrassed to have is name on something that a lazy eighth grader generated with a PowerPoint. Redo all the box-art.  Even on my shelf it fails in comparison to the BBC/Nat Geo art (picture to come). Seriously, here's what I recommend to the producer (who is missing out on a lot of money thanks to his shoddy taste in art design)--go to any graphic art college and hire, for a pittance, some lowly grad student desperate to expand her portfolio and update the box art to something on the tier of what the BBC is putting out there. Think elegant, sophisticated and respectful.

Okay, sorry, I know that seems harsh, but consider that I gave this 5-stars, because it deserves all five. It features superb educational character, superb visuals and quality high definition cinematography. I especially adore the flooding scenes that show the Amazon forest dry and navigable in one moment then flooded, like, ten feet deep the next, with snakes and otters cruising about. Another recommendation, the could fare a few more panoramic shots.

Nevertheless, for any nature documentary enthusiast, I certainly recommend this series.  I'm going to revisit the documentary in the coming weeks and give a thorough breakdown, in this review I just want to show much loyalty and constructive criticism on the standout facets.",1348790400,2,2733,5.004415011037527
8338114,5,B001RJWRPE,The photography is amazing and the transition from dry land to flood zone is fascinating. The way the inhabitants adapt to the change is unbelievable.,1311724800,2,150,5.04
