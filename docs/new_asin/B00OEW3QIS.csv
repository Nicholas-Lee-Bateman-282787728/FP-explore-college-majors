8683349,5,B00OEW3QIS,"One of the best films of Union Pacific steam I have seen thus far! and if the Big Boys, FEF's, and both types of Challengers aren't enough then there are a few gas turbine scenes and some early diesel scenes as well! The show starts with the Big Boys, showing them mostly slugging it out on Sherman Hill with a few coming in or departing the yards (4014 and 844 are also feature in the film in regular freight and passenger service). Next we see both the 3800 and 3900 big Challengers in service on the eastern portion of the Union Pacific's transcontinental route. Then the 800s in both freight and passenger service. Only a few scenes are given to the turbines before we move on to early diesels. Most of the film is in color and most of it has sound, and most of the scenes are never before seen! Highly recommended indeed!",1426550400,,826,4.37012987012987
