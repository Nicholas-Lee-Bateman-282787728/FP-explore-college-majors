7812628,1,6301497368,$119.75 is practically a steal for this knock your socks off horror fest of a film. I would pay like a thousand dollars at least for such quality of VHS. When you watch it VHS really makes you feel like your in the movie. I give it 119.75 stars for an effort of even thinking anybody would pay that much hahahaha,1418860800,,312,4.131147540983607
7812629,4,6301497368,"Yet another humdinger of a movie from Dan Haggerty.  He's basically the Babe Ruth of hittin' humdinger moveis out of the park.  This is a great holiday chiller, a fine addition to your Christmas spookshow shelf.  A true Humdinger, in the Haggerty tradition.",1392854400,,257,4.930232558139535
7812630,5,6301497368,"First let us start off by saying Merrrrry Christmas to all fellow lovers of B. Could there be a better time of year? Of course not! The NFL season is ramping up with the playoffs around the corner, the decorations are out, and the holiday B is in the air. It's only fitting with less than a week away a Christmas horror B would be viewed...oh did we mention it's called Elves? Yeah Elves, awesome. This is a film that clearly wasn't a mainstream success, or even a direct to video success as it is just flat out horrid. Even Pathmark refused to put it in their $3 bin. Yeah the same Pathmark that had a mint copy of Death Ring for sale! Now please don't misconstrue our labeling of ""horrid"" as we mean it as a compliment. For us horrid means fantastic. For anyone seeking a legitimate horror then run far from this screaming ""he's gone, the evils gone from here!"" But if it's hilarious B you seek, then please view away. The only issue is finding a copy as it is a rare flick. We luckily obtained one of the grainiest copies known to man kind, which is exactly how a film of this caliber should be watched. It will instantly transport you back to a time of strolling through the local video store horror section to find the most intriguing box art available. This one would easily have made the cut for us back in the early 90's.

Elves starts off with three teens sitting in the woods doing some anti-Christmas ritual. As they make their way back home it appears they've conjured up a nasty little elf. However this isn't a harmless elf like Sid, it's a very evil one. The film then takes an awkward shift to the local mall where the mall Santa gets murdered. Enter the incomparable Mike McGavin. Mike is a burly fellow with golden locks and stones of steel. He was a detective, then downgraded to mall security, further downgraded to the replacement mall Santa. Being he has no home, Mike decides he'll sleep in the mall and winds up meeting one of the girls from the ritual. Late one night the killer elf makes his appearance and the battle ensues. Please let us paint the picture of this elf. It's clearly a tiny person in bulky, poorly made plastic. The head is a mask with a wide opened mouth. The mouth stays opened the whole time with no change in facial expression. The actor was clearly so uncomfortable in the get up as he isn't able to move at all. He just stands there like a mini Myers. This adds so much value to the B quality. From here on out the movie is all over the place, but here's the gist. Turns out this girl is the desired virgin hand picked for the elf to impregnate in order to create a superhuman race. We learn that the Nazi's created elves to be super soldiers, and had it in their future plans to repopulate the earth with elf people. Yeah the plot is as insane as it sounds. While all this is taking place, Mike McGavin is smashing faces with his mind set on destroying the elf. In the end they manage to destroy the elf with some magic stone, thus saving the world from the superhuman elf race.

Elves is by far one of the oddest films one could get their hands on or try to make sense out of it. All you need to know is that it's absolutely hilarious in every way possible. Mike McGavin commands respect with an on-screen presence rarely seen from any actor. He's rugged yet gentile. After doing some IMDB research, we see he was actually Grizzly Adams and a competitive body builder. Wonder if he worked out in Venice Beach with Macho Man? This is a well rounded man deserving of a long prosperous career in B cinema. If Mike McGavin and Zap Rowsdower were to have a feats of strength, the heat of the battle would be potent enough to cause the world to implode. These are actors which you just can't find anymore. Two of the finest moments are when Mike is pounding in some villains face and asks ""how many teeth you have? Followed by a punch then ""Now how many teeth you have?"" and a scene where he rigs his own car with a stack of dynamite and leaps out of the car while it's moving, followed by a beautiful explosion. You just can't write this stuff any better. For those who share a similar love of the B arts, we must ask that you please watch Elves and welcome in the Christmas season. Santa treats everybody right and his main elf wouldn't steer you wrong. You've 8 days remaining because Christmas only comes once a year baby!",1355702400,4,4371,4.329268292682927
7812631,4,6301497368,"I remember seeing a commercial for this movie when I was around seven years old and had it stuck in my head for years. I have been searching for it for the past five years wondering if I dreamed it all up. Well, it found out it was real, and it is a must for B-movie fans.

The story revolves around a plot by the Nazis to use Elves as a way to create the ""master race."" The granddaughter of a former Nazi member unwittingly unleashes the elves who need her to create the ""master race"" on Christmas Eve.

Really good for a ""Bad"" movie. It's hilarious in it's absurdity and is just all around funny.",1240099200,,598,4.146551724137931
7812632,5,6301497368,"I think Christ himself conceived of Elves, the cinematic attribute to faith in higher powers and the struggle for existence in a post-modern nameless world.  It has all the merits and markings of divine intervention.  Probably no human skull could hold the plotline, let alone just the main character's craftmanship and aptitude.  Elves is a superior feat, showcasing the inherent will to persevere and the indomitable nature of the human spirit.",1156809600,5,446,5.253521126760563
7812633,1,6301497368,"First off... Elves? Plural? There's one Elf Vs. Grizzly Adams. A hilarious flick if you enjoy crappy movies. Horrible acting, and then the Evil Ugly Elf has relaciones with the hot blonde chick at the end. Be sure to pack plenty of ganja when viewing... you'll need it. Quite possibly the worst movie ever made!",1139443200,,311,4.672727272727273
7812634,2,6301497368,"After the local department store Santa is stabbed in the crotch...to death (!) by a Nazi elf ol' penniless Dan Haggerty takes the job but soon regrets his decision when he accidentally gets caught up with the girl who the elf is chasing.

Why is a Nazi elf chasing the girl?  Well it's cause she's the only virgin in town whose grandfather is also her father (!) and if the elf bangs this girl at midnight on Christmas Eve then their child will be the Antichrist!  Wow.  I seemed to have overlooked that passage in The Bible.

Filmed on what looks to be $8,000 and directed with reckless abandon by Jeffrey Mandel - whose credits include CYBER-C.H.I.C. and FIREHEAD - ELVES still somehow kept me entertained and laughing (sometimes hard) for the entire 89 minutes.  Watch it with a friend.",1119830400,2,789,4.6
7812635,5,6301497368,"The 5 star rating only applies for people who enjoy bad movies. It would be a 1 (actually more like a zero) if it was judged on it's merit as a serious film. Dan Hagarty plays an ex-cop who gets hired on as a department store Santa after the former Santa was killed by multiple stab wounds to the groin. It seems that a aged Nazi mad scientist has brought along a magically engineered creature with him to America where he has incestously produced a granddaughter to mate with this creature to give birth to the new master race. Dan chain smokes his way through his role and Deanna Lund makes an appearance as the wacko mother of the girl who is supposed to mate with the Elf. The ending will leave you asking the question ""Huh?"". Too bad MST3K didn't get a hold of this one.",1036713600,9,775,4.27891156462585
