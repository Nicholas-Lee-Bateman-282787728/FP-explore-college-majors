I am still waiting for a decent Nancy Drew series,  the movie versions are much better somehow Nancy doesn't work well on the small screen.",1360713600,,320,4.406779661016949
2869637,4,B000RMT9FI,"Compared to the 70s Nancy Drew series, this one might not be considered good because of the short stories and new Nancy.  However, I thought that everything was really nice about this series.  In this series, Nancy is 20 in the first two episodes then 21 in the last eleven.  She goes to college and is a criminology major.  She lives near Bess and George, two of her best friends.  The difference between this Nancy and the one we know and love is that she is a brunette.  We're talking dark black hair.  This made her a little unbelievable, but her personality was so spot-on Nancy Drew that you could overlook her appearance.  Bess and George were exactly what I would think of them as, Bess being bubbly and girly, while George was tougher (George is a girl for those who don't know).  Ned Nickerson, Nancy's boyfriend, appears in a few episodes, and in this series he doesn't support Nancy's love for mysteries, which was strange to me.  The episodes, although short, were really entertaining, in my opinion.  Some even had a little scare factor mixed in.  The endings were usually very fast, like they had to be wrapped up in the last 4 minutes, but they were still good.  Each episode is about 24 minutes, and they are all mysterious at some point.  I recommend this to Nancy fans and families who like mystery shows.",1262044800,19,1324,4.555084745762712

8201484,3,B000RMT9FI,"Must admit that I was disappointed in this show. Grew up loving the Nancy Drew stories; loved the old TV series with Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy. This version tried to ""modernize"" it? Make it relevant to today? But it didn't work for me. Everything felt stilted. Trying too hard.",1520553600,,278,4.58
8201485,2,B000RMT9FI,It was the wrong Nancy Drew movie it was supposed to be the 1995 tv. Series with Tracy Ryan instead it had the Nancy Drew movie with Emma Roberts in it!,1471996800,,152,3.935483870967742

 All in all everything was in great shape  very happy",1462233600,,128,3.7037037037037037
8201487,3,B000RMT9FI,"The cast of characters are so good in this series. Great acting.  All are well adapted from the book...very believable.  They all have the personalities described in the books.  Nancy is as mature as she seems in the books. The problem is the storylines are not developed. It ends just as story gets interesting. There is absolutely no development of a mystery.
With this series, we get a  Nancy and the gang we can really relate to....but no mysteries. It's too bad, because this could have been a really good series. This needed to be an hour show.",1436659200,2,550,4.581632653061225

8201490,5,B000RMT9FI,"What a great series! It is such a shame it only went for one season. Even though Tracy Ryan is a brunette, she was the epitome of Nancy Drew, intelligent, witty and determined. All the actors suited their parts to a tee. Would definitely recommend to all Nancy Drew fans!",1414195200,4,271,4.44

8201492,4,B000RMT9FI,"I like the thoughtfulness of this episode, although the writer or director has Nancy be slightly odd. The good value of this show is the relatively realistic, normal behavior, which is very refreshing to see. I would like to see this series revived, but not updated to the modern Hollywood idea of people.",1389744000,3,305,4.773584905660377
8201493,3,B000RMT9FI,"The show is watchable and even pretty entertaining but the character that played Nancy Drew? Totally not the right look and not very feminine. Plus, overbearing, inconsiderate to Ned and her friends sometimes. Not like the Nancy in the books at all. And blatant breaking and entering? Her dad is a lawyer, she wouldnt have broken laws carelessly like that. George and Bess are pretty accurate though although George is suppose to be more tom-boyish. I hate when media takes too much liberty and change the great parts of literature. And Ned? Nancy use to be considerate and Ned use to be super understanding and amused of her need to get into another case. So Other than the pushy obnoxious, boring Nancy, the show is decent. I love Nancy Drew exactly the way it was in the books=)",1366588800,,781,4.666666666666667
