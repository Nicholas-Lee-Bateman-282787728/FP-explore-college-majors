I wouldn't surprised at all if I this strange movie causes a couple nights of nightmares... this one will go down in the ""WTF Hall of Fame"" right beside Coraline and Ponyo (although Ponyo was actually entertaining, primarily because of the horrible parenting exhibited in the movie).

p.s. Amazon, please allow zero stars as an option.",1317427200,5,476,4.864197530864198
4652038,1,B005C9YZQY,I can't believe we rented this movie.  This is not the puss'n boots from shrek. The kids were wondering who this cat was.,1317427200,4,121,4.260869565217392
4652039,1,B005C9YZQY,"OMG this movie is so annoying, I stopped it after 5 minutes. My 7 yr old even left the room,saying: ""I don't like this movie"". William Shattner's raspy voice-over will definitely win the most irritating character voice of all time. it's cheaply made  & looks more like a puppet show than a cartoon movie. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.",1317340800,26,335,4.583333333333333
4652090,1,B005C9YZQY,"Yet that is exactly how this movie left me and my two boys only after the first 30 minutes.  It was bizarre and completely creepy.  The movie was originally filmed in French and has been dubbed over in English, therefor the voices do not match up with the dialogue, making it even MORE creepy....if that's possible.  The music is positively hideous.  And I might be a bit snooty, being an opera singer.  However, the completely BIZARRE arrangements of opera arias just left me....dumbfounded.  They seemed so pointless and only added to the creepy quotient.  Bottom line, I would give anything to have that 30 minutes of my life back.",1379116800,,634,4.761467889908257
4652091,1,B005C9YZQY,"I have never written a review on Amazon, but watching this garbage for 15 mins left me with no other choice.  It was creepy right from the opening credits, something about the music, I just had this feeling I should turn it off.  And I shouldve listened to my gut!!  I seriously feel like I scarred my 4yr old by even letting her watch a min of this. Princess who looks and acts like a mean stripper, a drunk queen, passed out king, creepy pedophile evil-looking chamberlain, and the cat who sounds like he's on at least a few hits of acid.  The music, animation, story, characters, all absolutely horrific.  To say its ""dark"" is an understatement.  How this is rated G, I have no idea. I'm going to have nightmares now for sure.  Thank god I rented with my tv's Netflix subscription and therefore can tell myself that I didn't pay to rent the actual movie.  Give this as a gift to the person u hate the most. Otherwise STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!",1374278400,,942,4.373563218390805
4652092,3,B005C9YZQY,"A young farmer's son inherits a strange talking cat with magical boots. With his cunning wit, Puss helps him win the heart of the Princess while battling devious suitors that are after the throne.

To be completely honest, I bought this DVD simply because of William Shatner's participation in it. I figured, if he was involved with it, it couldn't that bad. However, I was surprised with it. Not that it was bad, it had its' good points and all but, at times, I started to wonder exactly where this movie was going. When reviewers started using creepy and strange to describe this film, they weren't very far off. I began to say that about it myself. Even though it took some time to get rollin' good, by the film's end-Puss 'n' Boots turned out to be good. I'll admit, not quite Dreamworks' Puss 'n' Boots good...but good.

It's entertaining for what it is but, don't go into it looking for it to be up to Pixar or Blue Sky Studios level of CGI animation, Cuase you won't find that here. It looks like it was made back when CGI films first hit the scene. We all know it made leaps and bounds since that time.

Nonetheless, I'd rate The True Story of Puss 'n' Boots okay in my opinion. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewhere for a five-spot, it's worth getting. Yet, be forewarned, it's not quite what you're expecting. Keep an open mind.",1370822400,,1346,4.397590361445783
4652093,5,B005C9YZQY,"My three boys love this movie. It IS different and the voices creepy, but that is part of the fun of it. We enjoy originality!",1367280000,2,126,4.08
4652094,1,B005C9YZQY,"Shatner trying to do a cat voice was a complete FAIL! My ears were bleeding after fifteen minutes of dialoged. A high pitched nasal nails-on-chalk-board kind of terrible; Shatner singing ""Rocket Man"" terrible! The singing in the movie is just as awful - it's pretty bad when the actor's voice always cracks during the high notes. The story made no sense and had no content. Not even humor. I mean, they tried to be funny, but the punch lines to every joke kind of drifted off and got lost in a corn field. Just don't watch it. Your children will thank you.",1360108800,,556,4.46078431372549
4652095,1,B005C9YZQY,"This movie was purely awful. The voices are terrible. The queen sounds intoxicated, the voice for puss n boots sounds like he has bronchitis and says strange, random things. Terrible movie don't waste your time, go straight for the DreamWorks version that one is cute.",1358208000,2,268,4.977777777777778
4652096,1,B005C9YZQY,"My wife ordered this movie thinking she was purchasing the ACTUAL Puss N Boots movie with the cat from Shrek!  This movie should not exist and if it has to, there should be a warning in the Product Title stating that this is a sad attempt at consumer deception and that this is the worst movie ever created in the history of animated movies.  Shame on you Amazon for even selling this product.  I will be contacting Amazon and seeking some type of compensation - or - they will lose a Prime customer.  What a horrendous Christmas stocking stuffer for my five year old.",1356393600,3,568,4.4326923076923075
4652097,2,B005C9YZQY,"I watched this film on Netflix the other day and decided to see what people at Amazon thought. Luckily, I had realized before I started watching it that its original language was French. That said, I found the whole film bizarre and a bit perplexing. The music, while classical, sounded like it was being performed by an orchestra playing kazoos and combs wrapped in tissue paper. At one point an additional character, a piano-playing monkey, joined Puss and his owner. I couldn't figure out where the monkey came from or how they had met him. I suspect that many of the problems with this film stem from the dubbing. In many instances the English was a bit stilted, as though someone had tried to do a word-for-word translation from the original French. At times the voice over artists didn't seem to know what intonation to use. As a result I began to suspect that the original French version probably got a better review. I was right. I popped over to Amazon.fr and looked at what people were saying there. With 23 reviews, it had gained 3 and 1/2 stars, with 10 of the reviewers giving it 5 stars! But I think they agree with the American audience that the queen is a drunk. One French-speaking reviewer wrote ""The characters' voices are a bit bizarre (especially the queen's: you would say she had drunk too much)"" my translation. Speaking of which, I had had quite a bit to drink myself even before I started watching it. Perhaps I would have ranked it even lower had I been sober.",1349308800,7,1487,4.573033707865169
4652098,5,B005C9YZQY,"Again my granddaughters and I must differ from the rest of the crowd. We absolutely loved this movie. The music is great and the animation is uniquely original and gorgeous. It is quite a bit different from the usual sappy children's movie, I have to admit. I thought that William Shatner was absolutely brilliant as Puss. Very under-appreciated little gem!!!",1347062400,4,359,5.0
4652119,1,B005C9YZQY,"This is probably - no, positively -  the worst movie I have ever seen. Made the mistake of buying it; first time I couldn't continue watching after five minutes. My three year old wanted to see it and she watched maybe seven minutes before she left the room. William Shatner should be mortified to have his name on it. Or, hey, is it SUPPOSED to be a caricature? Truly, it didn't deserve the one-star rating I left, but there isn't a no-star rating available. Avoid it.",1346544000,6,469,4.453488372093023
4652120,1,B005C9YZQY,"We rented it from redbox thinking it was the Antonio Banderas version. It was horrible, creepy and something which people on a bad meth trip probably made. My kids are too young to realize how bad it was, but I was weirded out by it. Must avoid, worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad that I had to log into my amazon account to write just how bad it was. It was even worse than any Bollywood crap or Indie horror Euro cult movie.",1345334400,5,435,4.011494252873563

4652122,1,B005C9YZQY,"I selected this on Netflix and was increasingly annoyed with this movie. Immediately you feel uneasy and there is 0 connection with the story or the characters. Within the first 5 minutes of the film, I realized that this was NOT THE MOVIE I WAS LOOKING FOR and was feeling actual distain for the aggrivating protagonist! I originally was hoping this was the Shrek Trilogy character. Nope it was a poorly animated, horrifyingly arranged wannabe. There was nothing to look forward to except to find the escape button and find a different movie to watch.
DO NOT BUY this movie. Save your money for something like a dental visit, renewing your license at the DMV, or getting a haircut. All of which are MUCH more enjoyable experiences to sit through. It pained me to even give it 1 star. Negative 5 stars is more like it. P-U! This stinkfest is a tragic waste of man hours, film stock and no one should have to be subjected into giving away 90 minutes of their life watching this hot mess.",1339286400,10,986,4.544943820224719
4652123,1,B005C9YZQY,"I saw this movie on Netflix with my family and it was the worse movie I ever saw. The graphic are really good but the story and the characters are horrible and it's pretty dark too. The voice of Puss is extremely annoying and the evil royal court guy just got in your nerves. I hate the Queen when she talked. She sounded so drunk. (I thought it was a kid's movie) I also hate how they ruin classical music, like Beethoven, Mozart and Carmen with this cheesy re-mix. I don't recommend please save your money.",1336780800,2,508,4.302083333333333
4652124,1,B005C9YZQY,"This is the worst kids' movie I've ever been subjected to. It's totally inappropriate for kids of any age. It's racist, sexist, the characters are ugly, the animation sucks, the story is weak and predictable, the so-called music is horrible, and Shatner's voice is just grotesque. I feel fortunate that I neither bought nor rented this movie, but if I can deter even one parent from doing so or streaming it and wasting an hour and a half watching it with their kids (while possibly scarring them emotionally)  then maybe I'll feel slightly justified in having had to suffer through it firsthand.",1336262400,2,596,4.8431372549019605
4652125,3,B005C9YZQY,"The first time i saw this movie, I thought it was incredibly annoying.  My children, however really ended up liking it.  They've watched it several times, and I've actually come to appreciate the music.  The voice of the cat, is a far cry from Antonio Banderas, but given an open mind, it's worth watching the whole thing.",1334448000,,322,4.614035087719298

4652127,1,B005C9YZQY,"Totally turned off by the creepy characters and the cat's voice within five minutes.  Is this Puss in Boots on acid?  Not sure what possessed the producers to make a film this way, but it has to be the worst effort in many years (ever?).  Felt bad for my kids, who watched it and just shook their heads.  Save yourself the money, unless you like accidents.",1332547200,,356,4.348484848484849
4652128,1,B005C9YZQY,"This movie is just a miserable, horrible failure.  The voices sound like they were recorded under water.  The characters look like something out of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It is devoid of any humor or excitement.  The dialogue doesn't sync up with the mouthing of the words.  It lurches from one scene to the next and at times without connecting them.  This is not a movie an actor brags about being in.",1332460800,,411,4.561643835616438
4652149,1,B005C9YZQY,"My life has been shortened by some 4 years, and that was only from watching about 10 minutes of the movie.  So terribly awful.  If you value live, don't watch this... thing.",1331337600,,173,4.375
4652150,1,B005C9YZQY,"This is simply an awful release.  I didn't pay close enough attention at the Redbox kiosk and thought I was getting the recent major studio release of Puss N Boots but got this instead...wonder how many other suckers like me ended up with this by mistake, poor saps.  In any case, this movie is really bad.  First, the pros: the animation is actually decent.  Uh, that's really the only pro I can think of, otherwise this thing is a mess.  The voice acting is exceedingly grating and overblown across the board, from Puss himself to the drunken queen to the villainous chamberlain - each character voiced so annoyingly that it's impossible to like any of them.  The dialog is sophomoric and often times so weird that it's hard to know what the characters are even talking about much of the time.  Really the whole thing has an exceedingly weird vibe, but not a good kind of weird, not charming-weird, or clever weird, just ""this doesn't make any sense"" weird.  My 7 year old son must have said a few dozen times during the movie, ""Dad, this is weird"" and mom and dad couldn't have agreed more.  Be aware too that many of the female characters in this G rated ""family"" film are hyper-sexualized in their appearance, wearing skin tight outfits that reveal lots of cleavage and accentuate their exaggeratedly curvy physiques.  Not the kind of thing my son & 3 year old daughter need shaping their perception of what womanhood is about.  In the end, here's the deal: the narrative is clunky and awkward, the characters are unlikeable, the dialogue is juvenile, and the overall tone is freakish.  Be careful at the Redbox and avoid this stinker.",1331251200,,1640,4.67595818815331
4652151,1,B005C9YZQY,"Okay...here's what you need to know. 1. The opening theme sounds like bad intestinal gas. 2. The queen acts and looks like a very drunk Roseanne Barr. 3. William Shatner tries on a feline voice and sounds horrid. 4. The Princess looks like Halle Berry and sings the seduction scene from Bizet's Carmen, which is not family material. That said, you've been warned. Run. I caught this stinker on Netflix and I'm still recovering. Rated one star but should be ZERO.

Don't waste the money on this. Get the Antonio Banderas version, but neither are actually true to the fairy tale. The True Story, indeed. This one is almost as bad as Titanic, the Animated Musical.",1330473600,,661,4.698275862068965
4652152,1,B005C9YZQY,"Obviously not the version we thought we were watching after a few minutes in, but gave it a chance.  It was a waste of our time.  Awful all the way through.  The cat's voice was awful (and later find out it's William Shatner?).  The animation was slow and weird.  About the only thing positive about this is that it makes you realize how good Dreamworks and other are at making their animation smooth and not distracting.",1330214400,,421,4.4868421052631575
4652153,1,B005C9YZQY,"Avoid this movie at all costs. It is absolutely horrific in every aspect. My wife and I rented this Blu-ray to watch with our eight year old daughter and five year old son, and every single one of us thought it was atrocious. Especially the voice acting. I like William Shatner as much as the next Trekian, but he did a terrible job as the voice of Puss'n Boots (it made me want to put sharp objects in my ears).

If I could give it zero stars I would. Do yourselves and your kids a big favor and never watch this movie.",1329868800,,520,4.098039215686274
4652154,1,B005C9YZQY,"We rented this to watch with our toddler. I'm getting a headache, and it's put my husband to sleep. There is no real story in this movie. The cat is a ridiculous character that speaks shrilly and has no depth whatsoever.  We generally enjoy children's movies that are well written, but this one is far short of that mark. Save your money--more importantly, save your time!",1329523200,,372,4.636363636363637
4652155,1,B005C9YZQY,"I rented this thinking that  it was the Antonio Banderas version...do not be fooled like I was, this movie was horrible!  My husband and I turned it off 5 minutes into it.  I had rented it for my 3 year old, it was definitely not appropriate.",1329264000,,242,4.217391304347826
4652156,3,B005C9YZQY,"It's a French CGI rendition of Puss n Boots....dubbed into English...with Shatner providing Puss' voice. Just the words ""France"", ""CGI"", and ""Shatner"" in the same sentence promises pure comedy gold, right?

To reiterate: it's French. That's probably all that many readers of this review will wish to know. For those readers, you are dismisssed - please exit quietly.

OK, for the rest of you, here's the deal.

The pace and animation are in a style that is definitely wayyyy outside of American mass-market tastes. I would say ""slightly psychedelic"" - a distant relative of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, in a way. Unless your taste in flicks runs toward the indie/art house end of the spectrum you'll probably hate it. Disney/Dreamworks/Pixar it ain't.

And! If you thought American movies were sexist, the female characters are all endowed with deep cleavage, thin waists, and thick badonkadonk (except for the drunk old queen). Overtly appealing to the bored fathers in the audience (and boredom IS a risk, here). The voluptuous princess wears a skintight outfit - kinda reminded me of Eartha Kitt's Catwoman. Beyonce comes to mind, too. Another reviewer captured it very succinctly: ""T&A"". Didn't bother us, but it might bother both the feminists and the fundamentalists out there.

Inexplicably, my son liked it. In the end that's all that counts, right? Nonetheless, that's probably the one and only time we'll watch it.",1329177600,5,1419,5.125541125541125

4652189,1,B005C9YZQY,"My kiddos wanted to watch this (Age 3 and 4 1/2) on netflix, and I figured it would be, at its worst, a very poor copycat of the Dreamworks version. OMG! It starts off with an overly sexy Princess with a huge butt suggestively dancing. The female characters in this film were dressed like hookers - they did not belong in this film, they belonged in a rap music video wearing J-lo jeans. When the characters were speaking their lips never moved in sync.
William Shatner is the voice of Puss in Boots, and apparently had a hair ball in his throat the entire time if his weird, high pitched, raspy voice is any indication.
The faces were weird and sort of satanic (possible night mares for me now) - their movements jerky and clay like.
We didn't make it 15 minutes before I'd been creeper out to the Max and shut it down.
My kids were not impressed, and I'd rather be gut punched than see it again.

My wife rented it thinking it was the Shrek Puss in Boots and we kept waiting for Antonio Banderas to stop talking in falsetto (not realizing it was William Shatner - and that alone was worth the cost of the rental). Either destined to be a cult classic or just plain terrible. I'll let you know after I stop laughing.

I thought that even at five she would be able to recognize weak animation, a lame/unfunny script, and irritating voice overs that weren't even close to matching the mouth movements.

""I thought that the movie itself was really quite wacky in a good way.  It wasn't bad, though, because it was pretty funny, and I especially liked all the musical theater references that they threw into it, i.e. a jazz Carmen in French and a song from Westside Story.

The animation is suspect - limited movement by the characters - reminiscent of claymation, the voice and animated character's lip movements always seem to be a bit off, the story line is ill conceived and not fully explained (think of a combination of the classic tale of Puss n' Boots combined with several Biblical proverbs all mixed with no plot, theme, or story line). I can't believe there was any editing or re-takes because at many times the character's speech is incoherent and mumbled. The singing leaves a lot to be desired. The princess character looks like she came directly from an anime porn website.  The final product is sub standard and put out for the sole purpose of separating a parent from his or her money without providing anything of substance. Do not rent, buy, watch, order, or speak of this movie for any reason unless it is to warn others against watching it.",1323734400,15,1359,4.734177215189874

The cat's voice is a man (Shatner?) who talks in a shrilly high voice and is constantly making noise. All kinds of noise. Sound effects, screaming, etc. It's like watching someone scratch their fingers on a chalk board. I rented it for a dollar and enjoyed the lesson I learned... again.

I think that the way the animated characters are dressed are inappropriate for you children, there are some pretty dark scenes, and the voices are just creepy(William Shatner really should have used his regular voice)! This movie was just not age appropriate for us! The animation was really great though!!  I would have to say that we DO NOT recommend this movie to everyone, that parents should watch it first to see if they approve of it for their child (should really have a PG rating)!!

The animation is a bit stilted but the story line is engaging and the music is quite good (features Carmen's Bizet, La Donna e Mobile, and other well known opera classiques).  What I disliked about this movie was the hyper sexualization of the princess' figure (nothing new here), the asleep, useless King (another useless male model), and the emphasis of the suitor being a Marquis (aka rich) but that's part of the original story line.

4652253,3,B005C9YZQY,"First off if you are trying to compare this Puss `N Boots story to the Puss from Shrek, then you will be sadly disappointed.  The characters are totally different.  Once you separate out the movies and characters though it makes it easier to watch the movie.

This movie is just over an hour and its animation is not as cheesy as I expected.  It is a story of a man who inherits a cat who talks and wears red leather boots that he makes for him, his dad's dying request.  After falling for the princess, Puss takes matters into his own hands and helps him win over her heart.  It is a very strange story with very strange characters.  Now my 3 year old watched this and really only liked the music and there was some funny songs throughout the movie.  He wasn't scared but I could definitely see some young kids being scared of certain scenes and characters.

Honestly I am indifferent to this movie.  I don't really like it but I don't hate it either.  The dialogue and story is so-so but the animation and songs were okay.",1320192000,2,1024,4.336842105263158
4652254,1,B005C9YZQY,"If you like foreign 'art' films, then perhaps this movie will appeal to you.  If your tastes are more mundane, then this is likely to be far too weird for you to watch.

If you've EVER seen a French art film before, then 30 seconds worth of the opening credits over weird jungle sound effects followed by a kazoo/accordian-rendition of Beethoven's Fur Elise in bouncy carnival-style rhythm ought to tell you exactly what you're in for.

To a typical American audience, French humor often just seems absurd - it's a kind of ""lunacy"" rather than the ""funny"" we're used to.  A four-year-old might still be amused, an eight-year-old may already find it too nonsensical.

Visually, it's a bit behind modern expectations, and not much better than prior generation video game cut-scenes.  Facial expression animation is minimal, and there are numerous ""technical"" faults - close-up texturing glitches, inconsistent shadowing, etc.  It's certainly not up to par with Dreamworks/Pixar/Blue Sky/etc.  There are a few nice scenes sprinkled in, but most of it is pretty bland.

Musically, it's absolutely dreadful.  Tra la la la.  Turkeys and my sheep.  It simply cannot be adequately described in words, you'll have to hear it for yourself to despise it as much as it deserves.

Still, hidden within is a gem:  Shatner.  In true Shatner hack form, his acting is SOOO bad as to be hilarious - like a train wreck.  Just close your eyes and picture him reading the script - if you're a Shatner fan BECAUSE you appreciate his overacting, then you'll be rofl.  OTOH, if you take Shatner seriously, then you'll be crying ""why would he do this movie?!"", because obviously no-one has let you in on the joke yet.  Though I'm never quite sure if Shatner himself KNOWS he's a joke, or if he's just blissfully oblivious and truly believes his work to be genius.

The ""step two: the costume"" sombrero dance to the monkey's toy piano is among Shatner's finest work EVER.

In the words of the Chamberlain himself (about 40 minutes in, if you can make it that far):
""Do you like toads?  I mean huge toads, covered in oozing disgusting fat pustules - you like that?""  Seems like a fitting review of the movie itself.

It's sooo bad, it's almost worthy of cult status.  But after watching it, if you find that you like it, just be honest with yourself:  you liked it BECAUSE it's bad.  You certainly didn't like it because it's good... because it's not.",1320192000,9,2424,4.752997601918465

The musical numbers in this movie are very good although most of the music is taken from popular operas and musicals. The animation, voices, and plot are good. The cat's voice is fine, Shatner does a great job. My daughter and I really liked the movie and have watched it three times so far. It is a bit off-beat but after watching hundreds of Hollywood animated productions and especially the horrid Disney sequels to its commercially successful movies such as Bambi II, Lady and the Tramp II, The Lion King 1 1/2, etc. this French movie is a breath of fresh air.",1320105600,3,779,4.60431654676259

4652258,4,B005C9YZQY,"The 411:
This movie stars William Shatner as the voice of Puss 'N Boots.

In this movie adaptation, the storyteller, explains that he witnessed a story and he has decided to tell to the young and old.  Then our story begins with the Chamberlain, Queen and Jester discussing how they must find a husband for the princess.  The princess wants a dancer and the Queen doesn't feel she needs to marry. My favorite parts of the movie starred the Queen! She is huge, lazy and uses a fly swatter to wake her husband.

Next we see the princess who is dancing and singing badly and our hero Peter, whose dying father willed the family's cat to him and instructs him to make the cat, boots out of the leather in a trunk upstairs in the attic. He dies telling his son to always have trust in his cat.

The princess loves dancing so much that she goes out to a tavern masked and sings with her strange back up dancers.

The cat introduces Peter to the Princess and they fall in love much to the Chamberlain's dismay.

While I like the graphics and think the story is OK. There were many disturbing moments. The princess's singing and dancing for one. AWFUL!  The princess and Peter talking in front of a big bed and than kissing right before the princess starts singing ""I feel pretty"" the next day. Strange message! But the worst part of the whole movie was William Shatner's voice! Ugh...never have I heard something more disturbing. When I asked my 6 year old her thoughts on the movie she said, ""I didn't like the cat's voice"". Huh, she didn't like it for the same reason and she doesn't even know who William Shatner is.

The lesson behind the movie is a good one and could be lost in the translation, You don't have to be at the top of the food chain to finish first. If given the opportunity and with confidence, even a miller's son could marry a princess.

If you are going to watch, watch it with an open mind. This movie stays truer to the story and is dark at times. However, as a fan of animation, especially the 3D animation that doesn't require glasses it is worth a watch.",1319587200,4,2074,4.363636363636363
4652259,1,B005C9YZQY,"I will have to say this was an interesting video. It had a lot of fun parts but a lot of parts I would not want my child to see and the voice to lips was weird too. I think this might have been a French cartoon first and then dubbed over with English.
I did love the spunk of Puss `N Boots. He was just as I would have pictured him from the books I read as a child.
The things I wouldn't want my child to see were parts of the princesses and how she seemed to get away with being very rude to the people who were there to help. In the end she turned out nice but I just didn't like how mean she was and I don't want my children to act like her. The queen was very creepy and would have scared/confused my children. And I didn't like the whole hidden meaning behind the boy being naked and the queen inviting him to the castle. It was all too weird and would have messed up my kids minds.
Seriously, this movie was a waste of 79 minutes of my life and I'm glad to have previewed it before my children watched it.
I HATE giving bad reviews but I had to be honest with this one. Not worth watching.

The theme and moral of the film teaches children that bearing false witness will grant you women, fame, and fortune. Not to mention the awkward moment when Peter and the Princess are found in an empty bedroom in which they say ""Soooo, now what?""  There is also a question of what the film makers are implying by introducing a talking Jamaican monkey.
