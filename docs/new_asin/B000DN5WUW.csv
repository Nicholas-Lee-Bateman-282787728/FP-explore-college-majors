2475019,4,B000DN5WUW,"I have been in Iraq and Afghanistan for five years now, longer than any other American.  I was amazed at this work, as it strikes all the points accurately as I have seen it.  I did see a little too much leaning on the side of we should not be over here, but then I do agree with him.  We did have a choice, and even if it was correct at the time, I have seen way too much money poored into this part of the world for country building while the people do not need, want, or deserve it.  A price of plywood for instance is out of site at a lunberyard anywhere in the states, but look at the acres of it stacked up over here mostly going for non-essential projects, and it makes you angry if you are trying to build a house.  I have only one thing I did not like of the program, and I understand why he did it, but he should not have.  I know of the place that one GI soldier was speaking of to go to make love, and yes, it does happen way too much.  It goes in general to show a disrespect for the American soldier in general, and of course the bad apples in the crowd.  I have been a believer that women should not be deployed here as I see reasons every day.  But it was so hard for me to view that scene.  Even married women seem to take a sort of ""freedom"" logic here, if they be from another country as contractors, or in the military...they all seem to hook up with somebody.  That is a problem for most of us.  I think anybody who wants to feel as if they know what this part of the world is like, this is a good show to view.",1167782400,4,1532,3.875
2475020,5,B000DN5WUW,"Mike Shiley is an adventure traveler and all around life enthusiast that has turned his passion into his life's work and mission - and that is obvious from the moment this film starts.

In Sept 2003 he got a flack jacket, faked a press pass, and against the advise of just about everyone he knew, hopped a plane to Iraq.  From the moment he arrives he's in danger. Yet alone with only his camera and the essentials, he prevails and  makes friends everywhere he goes.

He spent many months making his way through the country, talking with people, hearing their stories, and filming it all.  He spent time with civilians, the Iraqi military and the US Military. Everywhere he went, he got gripping footage,  opinions, and a slice of life as people saw it. It was extremely real and very sad. The outcome is AMAZING.

Places and people are shown as they are - it is the first footage I've seen where I could actually begin to comprehend how life has changed since the war began and see what impact its had on the people.

Above all, this film is about people. He did not politicize or  show a skewed version of things. Just the facts - and in many ways these facts speak volumes that no mainstream media, military personnel, local Iraqi or political analyst could ever match alone.

I recommend it VERY HIGHLY. Buy it now if you want to see what is really happening in Iraq.",1156809600,18,1371,4.469879518072289
2475021,5,B000DN5WUW,"Mike Shiley, almost on a whim, decides to take us inside Iraq.  He goes to places not normally traversed by professional journalists to get the ""real"" story.  Most western journalists in Iraq rarely (if ever) venture outside the Green Zone.  The possibility of ambush, being kidnapped and getting tortured / executed is just too great.

Enter Shiley, someone who is not a professional journalist.  He takes us on a ""tour"" of the Iraq of today in the post-Saddam era.  He introduces us to Iraqis who love us (believe it or not, there are some) as well as those who loathe us (a higher percentage, I would say).

While the DVD does not set out to bash the Bush administration, Shiley does implicity show just how badly Dubya has bungled this whole venture.  If the self-appointed geniuses who work for the Bush administration would take the time to watch this film, they just MIGHT be able to make decisions that are productive.  As it stands, Iraq will likely continue to be a stagnant quagmire due to the ignorance of the Bush administration and it's broken-record statement of ""Stay the course.""

Beyond that, we see the human side of what's going on over there.  It is painful to watch in several instances.  We hear about American soldiers being killed on CNN on an almost daily basis.  That's bad enough, but what we don't normally hear about are all the Iraqis who are being massacred & caught in the crossfire.  Typically we only hear about Iraqi casualties if there is a spectacular attack.

If you have an interest in what is REALLY going on in Iraq and wonder about the future of the Middle East, then I cannot endorse this movie highly enough.",1148169600,14,1653,4.651724137931034
2475022,5,B000DN5WUW,"Mike Shiley's film is a rich account made by a corageous US citizen, posing some of the best questions to date about the utility of lethal force and how to achieve the strategic aims in Iraq. This film puts most of US network war reporting to shame, and beats all of it hands down.

This should be required viewing in military academies and colleges.",1145059200,17,350,4.46875
2475023,5,B000DN5WUW,"Below are media and university reviews for Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories:

MEDIA REVIEWS

Those who are strongly for or against the Iraq war won't find their positions unequivocally supported by this film. Which is what makes it worth seeing.

The Portland Tribune

Shiley's film is an incredible guided tour of the Iraq that has yet to be adequately portrayed in mainstream American media. The result is an emotionally complex film that provides perspective on a complex reality that the government has worked to simplify, and the media has done little to clarify.

Willamette Week (Portland, OR)-Movie Review

It's a journey worth taking, but better him than you.  He poked into things that journalists and others don't usually stop to examine, and he emerged with a highly personal travelogue that sheds a light on a complex and volatile situation.

The Oregonian Living Section

Shiley deserves credit for going to Iraq twice by himself (both times for a month) and trying to get stories he believes are worth showing.

2475028,1,B000DN5WUW,"I watched this ""film"" hoping to get a look at the Iraqi people.  I was in Iraq myself 2007-2008 and worked in a largely capacity building role which involved daily personal interaction with Iraqi professionals and their families.  Through this, I developed a deep respect for the Iraqi people and was looking forward to hearing more of their stories.  Instead, what I got was an amateurish piece of anti-war propaganda.  What ""untold stories"" were there other than that of the self indulgent narrator?  The only enjoyable part was watching the Iraqi gentleman call his bluff about being Canadian and announce himself as ""Nigerian.""  This, I thought, was the best insight to the Iraqi people I know: a people possessed of remarkable intelligence and humor.  Unwittingly, the ""filmmaker"" in this exchange did exactly what he accuses others of: he assumed the Iraqis were stupid and he was their superior.  Glad it was free on prime.  Would be angry if I paid for it.",1428451200,3,964,4.901234567901234

I thank you Mike for your courage in doing this documentary and the opportunity to see the sacrifice of many brave soldiers. History is incomplete if we are not capable of seeing and learning from both sides of a conflict.

2475042,1,B000DN5WUW,Seems this Shidog guy that made the film was lead around by his nose by a Saddam sympathizer through Iraq and brainwashed into making a self loathing film that seemed to blame America for anything and everything. He started the bashing in the get go and I was waiting for there to be a redeeming part of his film but there wasn't at least not up till the 21 min I suffered thru,1379462400,,377,4.178082191780822
2475043,4,B000DN5WUW,"Technically, this is very well done . . . both audio and video.  The video is worth watching and formulating your own opinion. Interesting footage that presents well dressed and well nourished Iraqis civilians and still offers the images of those who suffer. A simple hospital with complicated injuries caused by land mines and counterpose with those working to find and dismantle known existing mine fields (an example). The military personel are shown as individuals that offer a gamut of behavior/emotion.

I chose to read all the reviews 'after the fact' instead of before watching the video. Perhaps this might be considered as a 'review of the reviews.' Each review offered is personal . . . some more than others and I find their views as interesting as the video because at a given point, I can agree with some of the commentary.

And so it remains: ""The End . . . nowhere in sight""",1376524800,,890,4.7290322580645165
2475044,4,B000DN5WUW,"Highly biased, but pretty good footage nonetheless.  Difficult to watch the criticism though when the soldiers the guy is embedded with were putting themselves in front of the bullets.",1369872000,,184,5.344827586206897

2475046,1,B000DN5WUW,"I guess I should not be surprised someone would put out such a biased anti-war piece. But it does surprise me that as glad as the people were to be rid of Saddam and no longer be under a dictator, that the video creator would work so hard to make that look negative. Instead of talking about the free trade, he talks about the porn that is part of the free trade. Instead of talking about how the Iraqi soldiers are smiling and glad to not be serving a dictator, he talks about how they are making less money and have equipment that isn't as good as it used to be. Instead of talking about how the people are now able to have more opportunity at education and how women are able to be educated at all, he talks about how the tech school has been looted and needs computers. Instead of talking about all the happy people he comes in contact with, he talks about how some streets are barricaded off and there are lines for gas.  He talks about how safe the Kurdish region is but neglects to mention how much pain and agony they were in with ethnic cleansing, WMDs against them, and total suppression under Saddam before the war.  When he saw the weapons sale, he acted like it was a bad thing.  Instead of talking about how the people are now able to buy weapons to protect themselves, he makes it sound like the people there were just looking for ways to attack passing cars.... which just means the creator of the video lives in a country where he doesn't have to worry about a dictator overtaking him and his family every day.

When he was with the soldiers and he had the chance to talk about (and talk to the soldiers about) all the great things they have done while they have been there to bring peace and help rebuild, instead he paints the troops as XBOX playing lonely saps who are stuck because we haven't brought them back yet... hardly what the soldiers would have said if he had asked them and posted their answers. Yes, they miss home. Yes, they miss spending Christmas back at home.  But every soldier I talk to was glad they were there and have LOTS of great stories about making a difference in the lives of those in Iraq and helping a country where only a select few used to have opportunity before.... and now the masses all have a shot at success. Oh, but the cussing complainers, he had room on the video for them...

He keeps repeating how little money the Iraqis make, how many people get turned away from being able to work, how much effort it takes for them to be able to work. But he doesn't bother to talk about how little prospect they had when everything was run by a select few under Saddam (they were mostly unemployed peasants).  He mentions that most can't even read and write their own language and that we are training them. But instead of presenting it like the blessing it is (we actually pay THEM to learn), he paints it like we are pushing our rules on them and like it is propaganda time instead of language learning time. At 65 minutes in, he shows where we shot people who were where they should not be and they knew the penalty. Yet, the video creator paints it like they are shooting innocent people and even says, ""Do we know if they are armed or maybe even surrendering""... Again, clearly the mindset of someone who has not been in that position before. I travel all over the world. I would be an idiot to think that when I am in dangerous places that the rules don't change.  That wasn't downtown Atlanta. The video creator tries to make our Army look like the Iraqi people must hate them shooting in the town in the middle of the night... but that isn't the case and the video creator never bothered to interview the people in the town and ask them.  But, thankfully, the soldiers understand better how to keep the law abiding people safe.  The law breakers get tired of it and that is the point.

These people are willing to go through all this pain in order to be rid of a dictator and have a chance at success and providing for their families. They get paid $10 a day to get rid of landmines and they are very willing to do so.  The US led the way for them and the people there are grateful. It is unfortunate that the creator of the video neglected to point out these and many more reasons why (here is a great list of reasons why[...]
This video is old (2004 and older).  But I doubt it would have made a difference to the video creator when they made it. Their goal was to paint it as not worth it.  But they are wrong. There is no guarantee when Iraq is all on their own that it won't fall backwards instead of forward. But propaganda videos like this one work against the Iraqis and not for them. The Iraqis deserve better than to have their country painted this way. Anyone would deserve better.",1365206400,,4750,4.304591265397536
2475047,4,B000DN5WUW,"Really liked this one.  Got you down in and with the people.  You could feel their pain, they anger, their gratefulness and hope for the future.

Overall a must see for those that are trying to understand the Iraq war.  Most of the movie was pretty unbiased except for the end where the producer felt the need to make an unnecessary political statement.  Had it not been for that I would have given it 5 stars.",1364515200,,410,4.342105263157895
2475048,5,B000DN5WUW,"Ron Paul ran a commercial on YouTube during the Republican Primaries asking how we would feel if Chinese soldiers were doing the same thing that our soldiers were doing to the Iraqi's.  If Chinese soldiers occupied our country....we would fight back.
If Chinese soldiers randomly fired their tanks by your home at 3am and started fires nearby for no reason...would you be upset?
If Chinese soldiers broke into your local church and had intercourse on the floor....would you be upset?

What this film does is cover both sides of the war....

What everyone should watch after this film is 'Hubris, Selling the Iraq War'.  After you see the suffering of the Iraqi citizens and realize that we should have never been in Iraq.....

The one thing that did not come up because the film was trying to be unbiased was the lack of leadership in our country at the time this war started.  One side lied about the WMD's and the other side were cowards and did not stand up to protest (some did).  We send men and women that are trained to kill and then are shocked when innocent people die.  This was a lack of leadership.

We were the bullies
We reacted out of fear",1363392000,,1154,4.536231884057971
2475049,5,B000DN5WUW,"This was excellent. I like the fact that Mike isn't a ""journalist"" with an agenda, he really gets all sides involved/victimized by the war. The two most memorable images are the Kurdish people where George W. Bush t-shirts and the ""harass and intimidate"" US Army drill. Assuming this was all real, this was a great documentary.

How'd he ""sneak"" his way into Iraq/Int'l Press/US Army though....?",1362009600,2,395,4.984848484848484
2475050,3,B000DN5WUW,"First and foremost, one has to acknowledge the courage of this young man. He's not a journalist. Just some guy who wanted to go to Iraq to discover what was happening regardless of the ever present danger. While doing this, he does provide some unique insights into our military, the Iraqi people and the interaction between the two. The good, the bad and the ugly. It is illustrated not through the eyes of the soldier, or the civilian as much as is own.
He does a fair jobs of trying to being impartial, but seems to believe that we should have been fighting a ""kinder and gentler"" war. That maybe somehow being ""nicer"" while trying to defeat an enemy would somehow be possible. I can't help but wonder if he understands what War is.
There is one scene where he is touring a bunker that during the initial attacks was filled with civilians. This was the attack that made world news because 230+ civilians died when the US dropped a ""bunker buster"" into the bomb shelter. He shows us the grave markers and the monument dedicated to those who perished and finishes the scene by asking ""Is this not a terrorist attack ?"". But he neglects to address any details whatsoever regarding how this tragic event occurred and leaves the viewer thinking that the USA targeted the bunker BECAUSE civilians were in it. A very irresponsible and baseless accusation considering the acknowledged facts surrounding that event.
In summary, there are some interesting and valuable insights in this work, but objective it isn't.",1359590400,,1508,4.759541984732825
2475051,2,B000DN5WUW,"The main element this film lacks is any kind of identity. Mr. Shiley presents himself as a neutral observer to the goings on in Iraq. He wants to be the man on the street for the American people because we have been summarily misled by the mainstream American media and dang it he is going to let us know what is really going on.
However he fails across the board. This film is more of an expensive home video. While the video and audio quality is fair there really isn't any other solid use of documentary or film technique employed. His narration is redundant and tedious.
As far as his position is concerned he offers a kind of puppy-teeth nibbling of the American presence in Iraq. He never really wants to chomp at the issue. He repeatedly stabs at America's arrogance and lack of compassion for the country they are liberating as he displays teenage exuberance because they let him shoot the big guns. On the one hand he is trying to show the widespread innocence and sensitivity of the Iraqi people and on the other he makes a mockery of the American soldier by becoming ""big-gun-certified"" in about an hour. Question to Mr. Shiley ""What would have happened if you squared up in those crosshairs, would you have taken a life?"" This film was nothing more than an ego trip for this guy as he posed as a documentarian and found little more to do than ruin a couple of army careers and play journalist.",1306281600,3,1405,4.4921875
2475052,4,B000DN5WUW,"My friend and I sat down to watch this on Netflix today and at first I was a little hesitant to watch because it's hard to gauge these days who's out there touting some rhetoric for someone else. I am happy to say that this film beat over my expectations. The films portrayal of some elements of the war, which aren't talked about often in the public sphere was fresh and rare in the world of documentaries today. I found the ""adventurous spirit"" of the film to be quite rare as well. Not many people know about some of these issue (Dumping of goods, field commanders dealing with seemingly tough problems in innovative and helpful ways, ect). Some have said that this film houses a bias, but I've watched it a couple of times now, and I really don't see it myself. If anything this is one of the least biased films about war in general, and the middle east in detail that I've ever seen.

I really liked how it focused on all the aspects of the war, from the bad things that happen all the way to the good, showing that not only can the ""bad guys be bad"", but so too can the U.S. soldiers sent to war ( one scene where some soldiers were referring to the Iraqi people as ""Hajis"" and a young female officer talked proudly about breaking into a mosque and having sex in a combat zone, a big no-no for troops deployed overseas).

I recommend this film to anyone curious about the war in it's early days.",1294617600,2,1401,4.283018867924528
2475053,1,B000DN5WUW,"BLUF: Very poorly edited, the narrator comes across as arrogant, in horrible taste, and I will never watch another one of his movies.

Overall, I have to say that the video was nothing that I expected.  Instead of being a documentary about the Iraqi people, it turned out to be a cheap political movie that likely ruined the careers of several Army soldiers (as Mike Shiley proudly points out in the ""Epilogue"").

The majority of Mike's feelings are blatantly anti-American, as far as our presence in Iraq is concerned.  Even when American soldiers try to lure insurgents out of a village, Mike complains that the gunfire at night is a nuisance for the local people -- without actually interviewing them (something that would have taken no time at all.  For all we know, the people there probably want the Americans to get the insurgents out of their town, as they bring in violence, bombings, and kidnappings (as Mike states earlier on in the movie).

In another scene, Mike records dozens of soldiers' messages home to their families.  Even if you ignore the assumption that Mike never mailed these messages home to those soldiers' families, the way he portrays the scene shows his lack of compassion for film making.  Instead of focusing on each individual message(emphasizing the importance of each soldier and his/her situation), he puts up all the messages on the screen at once, so that many of the messages drown out each other, making it seem like each soldier is in a shouting match with one another to get their messages across.

2475054,5,B000DN5WUW,"This is one of the best documentaries that I have seen. I'm a strong believer of the saying, ""There are three sides to every story, his side, her side, and the truth."" Most of us only know what the media shows or tells us about the war and what's going on over there. I'm not at all a political person, but I can't help but wonder about the Iraqi citizens and curious how they really feel about the U.S. I was thinking they're country has got to be pretty bad (even before the war) to want to leave their home and start a new life in a new country.  This documentary answers a lot of questions that I've been asking myself.

2475055,5,B000DN5WUW,"If you're tired of watching documentaries that are one sided, watch ""Inside Iraq- The Untold Stories"".  The director (Shiley) ""sneaks"" into Iraq and tells an amazing story based on his perspective as a civilian.  Bits and pieces of the film have already been poached onto Youtube & viewed over 1 million times!  Forget watching the pirated clips on your computer.  It's worth watching the full length film on your plasma screen at home. The images are amazing.

Anyone who has been to Iraq knows that the footage he has shot is very true to life in terms of the small village scenes, the way Iraqis communicate very well in english, even when limited by vocabulary, etc...

I'm curious what qualifies the film as ""unbiased"".  It is not.  It is biased as all films are -- one way or the other.  Certainly there are degrees.  For as rare as the footage that he has captured is, his anti-Bush perspective (including trying to coax a Bush-adoring Kurd to reconsider her opinion, or accidentally say something negative through mis-translation) is a small price to pay for those images.  We should not pretend he is not biased, though.

The narration is simplistic and heavy-handed, but also gives the piece a fresh feel.

I can tell you from watching projects like this get filmed and troops get interviewed, the most inflammatory moments in the documentary (soldier rants, tank crushing a car, nighttime harrassment fires) are surely the most inflammatory he shot.  They are terrible, and embarrassing for our nation, but they are not 'mainstream'.  He likely shot hundreds or thousands of hours of video, and chose his cuts selectively.  That is certainly his prerogative for the risks he endured.

Overall, this is a valuable addition to the Iraq body of work, but not an unbiased one.  This is the most footage that I have found in one place that gives an accurate view of the typical moments in Iraqi life.  After watching it, everyone will think more clearly and act more purposefully the next time a war debate comes up, as it will.",1182384000,11,1734,4.745819397993311

8102502,1,B000DN5WUW,"I would have given this movie zero stars if that was an option.  Sadly, it was not.  This movie was so liberal biased.  The film maker talks about his ""weapons quals"" as if it were nothing.  As if the men doing the job could be proficient in it with a 2 hour class.  The soldiers that the interviewed, to include the E6 that talked trash about their chain of command.....all of them should receive UCMJ action.  Disgraceful excuses for soldiers.  I have lost the time it took to watch this movie from my life forever.  I will never again get that time back, and that makes me sad.  Terrible movie.

You're telling the soldiers how to say tomorrow in Arabic and two scenes earlier when talking to the old Kurdish lady you could only say hello and made a fool of yourself.  You let the soldiers say merry Christmas to families back home thinking it would be on the news.  You post a clip from Appache helicopters shooting up some isurgents and act as if you secretly obtained this tape.  It has been all over Youtube and I am guessing that is where you found it.

I am glad no one lost their lives including you.",1458777600,2,636,4.3474576271186445

8102510,2,B000DN5WUW,"As an Iraqi from Baghdad, I have many reservations on this documentary. It is narrating from an incredibly ignorant point of view. Obviously the ""reporter"" in this documentary knows little to nothing about Iraqi culture, language, and history. It definitely showed Iraq as a poor, illiterate, and primitive country. The truth of the matter is Iraq was one of the most industrious and developed countries in the region as early as the 1960s. Also, during numerous occasions, the subtitling of Iraqi people was completely wrong and not even close to what was being said.

The documentary was good in showing why would Iraqis become terrorists and why would they resent the presence of the American forces. The attitude of some Americans (especially in the Ranting Scene) was disgusting and worthy of severe legal consequences. It also shows the hate that some ignorant terrorist-minded soldiers came with. Now that we are in 2015 and things are even worse than they were in 2004. It shows the scope of failure of the American administration and military. If anyone out there still supports the war in Iraq after the death of millions of people, the wasting of trillions of dollars, and the suffering of millions, then they must be categorized as terrorists and treated as such.",1433030400,,1275,4.985915492957746
