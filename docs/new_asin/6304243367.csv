843889,4,6304243367,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! ITS SO INTERESTING TO WATCH. WHAT MOST PEOPLE DONT KNOW IS THAT ITS FAKE. YES I SAID ITS FAKE. NEED PROOF? CHECK OUT THE INTERVIEWS FROM THE PRODUCER. KNOWING ITS FAKE MAKES IT MORE BEARABLE TO WATCH.,1118102400,4,220,4.390243902439025
843890,2,6304243367,"I am as facinated as anyone on this concept (you wouldn't be reading this otherwise). Howerver, the best thing about this is the intro on the first movie. That is pretty much it. I don't know, this is just so DATED. That aside, death is death and having it ""captured"" on film should really be timeless but since this is , well, FAKE! it doesnt cut through. Well, ""manipulated"" is a better word since the suicide jumper, alligator parachutist,snake bite ""victim"", police shoot-out with hostage, monkey brain smashing, to name a few are just that. I'll let you know the inside on a couple, though you can tell for yourself if you really notice. The suicide jumper dude jumps and , as falls, notice the car on the falling camera shots,notice the angles (obvious dummy doll). The chick with the snake bite victim (appears for a second) is the same girl(interviewed) on the alligator attack on the police guy on the lake(on Faces of Death I).The dude who ""killed himself in his cell"" after a series of serial murders of oriental women is the same guy who was the ""leader"" of a deadly cult group (on,again,Faces of Death I).How would police just bust a door open (hostage scene)and blindlessly blast away full blast with a female hostage inside and have her just come out.  No one I saw this with noticed this while first viewing but became quite obvious after explained second time around. All felt quite silly too, since first time seems (somewhat)real. 2 stars because the concept(and name)does get you, bet thats it.",1101168000,4,1514,4.713207547169811
843891,1,6304243367,"To get things started, this movie is only for sick and twisted people.  This dumb crap only had one real scene in it.  I won't tell and Spoil it.  All the rest was staged, and done horribly bad by the way.  At first it looked like some funny,fake crap that was amusing for 10 seconds, but then i saw some real STUFF, and I couldn't watch anymore! The only reason i saw most of #3 was cuz some other people started watchin it in the livin room and i had nothing else to do but waste PRECIOUS time.  All the rest of the FOD movies are dumb as well.  I just don't know why people like to see real people dying!  I saw about 1 part from each one of the rest of the series with a friend when he downloaded them from KAZAA (we thought that it all was goin to be some funny SPOOFS.  This was all before i saw #3.  In movies that are TRULY Fiction, blood and guts is really AWESOME!  But in real life, it makes me wanna gag!  I just don't find PLEASURE in watching real people dyin gruesome deaths.  Please don't watch this if your thinkin this was gonna be someethin HILARIOUS! (I don't know why i thought this was gonna be funny)  Wait!, some of the fake stuff is funny cuz it was acted out horribly.  Dont buy, rent, or even look at the cover of the boxes of any of these movies(if your NORMAL!)But for you others, ENJOY the worst (not even questionable) or (without a doubt) TRUCKLOAD of CRAP to ever be created!",1079395200,2,1408,4.1098901098901095
843892,1,6304243367,"This is unquestionably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The ""death"" scenes are all faked, clearly staged, and poorly at that! (The only scenes in the entire movie that appear to be genuine are footage from rabbit and chicken slaughter houses... what horror! :-P) Sometimes unredeemingly bad movies are so bad they're good. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Do not waste your time--or money--on this rubbish.",1044662400,4,407,4.828571428571428
843893,1,6304243367,"A Well made fictitious horror movie I can appreciate, this
despicable piece of trash I cannot.
How can anyone with a soul or conscience compile people's deaths'
into a film for profit?? or just for the deranged pleasure of it
I did not watch this, I knew some ppl who did. They were sorry
they did watch it...unbelievable not to mention very sad.
Don't buy this (or watch it) unless you are a twisted,sick, deranged ghoul of a person",1019606400,10,433,4.493670886075949
843894,1,6304243367,This video was very phony you could tell it was all staged if you want brutal violence go for ultimate street brawls at least thats all real.,1012521600,,141,4.2592592592592595
843895,3,6304243367,"I had only seen FOD 1, when I saw this. I'm just a sick Gore freak. Love horror films and the like, but this is more of a rush knowing that hidden in these dark and gory scenes are real scenes of death. The documentary element takes away some of the guilt of watching, but not all scenes are real, THEY DO CONTAIN SOME STAGED SCENE's. All in all I would recomend this to anyone who likes to be discusted, horrified, revoulted and even excited at the carnage they reveal. Not for the faint hearted or the squeemish. Don't take it too serious as anyone who is watching this type of film for the first time would/might not be able to distinguish the real from the fake.",1004918400,5,666,4.251968503937008
843896,2,6304243367,"Well I've seen F.O.D. 1 and I rated that one quite highly although they did go on a bit too long about autopsies, but I later read by several viewers 3 and 4 were the best, I think I bought the wrong one by the look  of the other write ups and by my own experience and wish I had bought 4.  The best part of F.O.D. 3 was the begining when they showed clips of the  other F.O.D. videos,  It seemed a lot more fake than the original and I was  quite disappointed although  it did have a few good scenes, you can spot  the staged scenes a mile off  but I would say overall 40% REAL 60% FAKE.  I  will risk buying F.O.D. 4 soon I just hope Its as good as Its meant to be,  if not I'll let you all know to save you all wasting your money......like I  did....",920419200,,753,3.8181818181818183

7868065,5,6304243367,I have watched part 1 part 2 and worst but this one is off the hook ya I coulda watched it free on you tube like everyone else but I wanted a real copy there were none on eBay and amazon wanted almost the same price as my local record store I paid 11.80 and was well worth it was very interesting I will be looking for the rest to add to my collection buying individuals is more fun than buyin em all at once I loved how it says in the end scenes were recreated and people still thought it was all real,1446768000,,502,3.8365384615384617

7868067,1,6304243367,It's alright. Not as good as the plain Faces of death. I was expecting more gore and live death. The regular Faces of Death. Is great. I wouldn't buy this one again.,1427241600,,165,4.1875
