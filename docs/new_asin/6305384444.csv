7889209,4,6305384444,"My three year old son enjoyed this video very much.  The animation is just average, but the stories teach good lessons - being responsible, helping friends, etc.  The musical interludes between stories is also entertaining to kids, and I think you will find them singing along.  Hours of enjoyment for just $10.",969753600,2,311,4.9423076923076925
