3512850,4,B001CIOCHQ,"THE SHOW:

Even though the show lives on in syndication (and I've seen every episode countless times as a result), it's still nice to finally have the episodes in their original, unedited format.

People like Bill Cosby and the late Fred Rogers shared a philosophy that television was a guest in the family home, and handled their shows with great care as a result - i.e., if you were going to watch their shows, then they felt that they owed it to you and your family to give you something worthwhile that you could enjoy together. As I revisited some classic episodes, I realized how special it was to have a show that pitched its humor in a way that seemed so down to earth, and earned its laughs without relying on catch-phrases or resorting to innuendo. The kids aren't perfect (they all manage to mess up spectacularly throughout the series), but the underlying theme of family and sincere (sometimes tough) love gave balance to the show and to me, keeps it timeless. I grew up with this show and enjoyed it immensely as a kid. Now that I'm a parent, I'm appreciating it on an entirely new level.

THE DVDs:

In terms of supplemental materials, you really can't ask for more than the wonderfully poignant  ""A Look Back"" documentary, and new interviews with Bill Cosby and director Jay Sandrich, all of which work to give the viewer an appreciation for how revolutionary the show was at the time, as well as an understanding of why the show is so special today as it was then. There are also some funny outtakes and a few director commentaries thrown in for good measure.

As I said earlier, it's great to have these episodes bundled in one set, but I feel that for a 25th Anniversary definitive series collection, the production team missed a step or two.

With 8 seasons' worth of episodes to enjoy, it would have helped to give the viewer some guidance on how to find their favorite episode. The set includes a hardback book of the pilot script, which is something that I'd browsed through once, and have no need to ever look at again. It might have been a bit more interesting had it included handwritten notes to hint at how the production had been modified from the original script, but it's a straightforward copy. A better use of the book would have been as an episode guide with a quick summaries and guest star listings (similar to the Simpsons box sets). As it is, you're left with a list of episode titles and your memory to help you find the episode where the Huxtables do a lip-sync routine for their grandparents' anniversary, the one where Theo learns about life in ""the real world"", or the scene of Elvin doing a perfect impression of Cliff, not knowing that he's standing right behind him.

There's also an insert with a note from Bill Cosby and an Al Hirschfeld sketch. Nice (I guess), but I'm not sure why they couldn't have been included in the book. There was no need to make them separate, so they end up seeming like afterthoughts to try and make the set ""special."" A wasted opportunity.

Another thing that detracted from the set was the inconsistency of the DVD menu style and navigation schemes across the seasons. They seem to be ported over from the individual season releases, so the viewing experience is a bit fragmented as a result. Some menus are a bit more frustrating to navigate than others, and only the later seasons contain helpful on-screen synopses of the episodes.

The video and audio are decent enough for the purposes of the content. It doesn't seem to have been remastered, but that's fine. You're watching a classic 1980s to laugh and enjoy some nostalgia, not to give your subwoofer a workout!

The boxset's packaging itself is very handsome, but the folding cardboard season cases are easily scuffed and the discs themselves are left to sit precariously within the cutout slots. It all feels a bit fragile. I would have preferred sturdier slimline cases to pop the discs into, but at 26 DVDs (!), I'd imagine that the decision to use cardboard reflected a desire to help keep the cost down.

Had these minor issues been addressed differently, I'd have given this set a solid 5 stars on the strength of the show itself.

All in all, this is a highly enjoyable and worthwhile collection that is a pleasure for older viewers to revisit and contains hours of quality entertainment for a new generation to discover.  Since the episodes are in perpetual syndication, I wouldn't consider this an essential purchase for casual fans (but you won't be disappointed if you pick it up anyway).",1227139200,13,4536,4.646691635455681
3512851,3,B001CIOCHQ,"I just received my Cosby show Complete Box Set.  The Box itself is heavy and looks like a book.  I'm not sure how it stays closed after being opened.  The 25th anniversary book which looks to contains the script of the first episode is nice.  I was shocked and dismayed to see that the 4 disc containers that contained 2 seasons each was made out of cardboard.  If I had known that I would not have purchased the complete series.  I don't why Companies that produce complete dvd series sets can't seem to understand that cardboard and dvds don't go together.  What's wrong with using dual sided platic slim cases or any other kind of plastic dvd casing or better yet the ""steelbook"" cases.  It wasn't scratched up like the Mash complete collection was but there was black debris from the cardboard on about half the discs. It looks like it can be removed without damaging the discs but it is really irritating.  Now I have to go out and buy some dvd cases or storage cases to hold these discs.",1226707200,83,993,4.441988950276243
3512852,5,B001CIOCHQ,"I'm a huge fan of Bill Cosby. I've been watching the re-runs on TV Land recently. The whole show is brilliant. Its kind of one of those significant titles that down the line is always going to be seen as being a HUGE show. When I saw there was a box set that had ALL the episodes from EVERY season, I had to buy it. It came out yesterday. I started watching it last night (there's a lot of watching going on here). There are some really cool bonus features with Bill and everyone else in the cast talking about what made the show so great. The opportunity to own every episode of The Cosby Show on one slick looking box set is to good to miss up. I would definitely buy this while you can. Its way too good and way to big of a collectable item to miss out on.",1226534400,7,759,4.0

For 8 hilarious seasons, viewers laughed with legendary comedian Bill Cosby's Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable and the talented cast that portrayed his TV family which at the time mirrored his real-life family as Cosby, too, married his college sweetheart and also had four daughters and one son.

Considered the most popular series of the 1980s, fans were dumbfounded that previous sets of The Cosby Show (from Urban Works Entertainment) were released with such poor treatment. Most notably,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B0007ZSHR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>&nbsp;which contained edited for syndication episodes instead of the original NBC broadcast versions.

Correcting the ills of the previous sets, this complete series release from First Look Home Entertainment features every episode - original, uncut broadcast versions - from all 8 seasons (plus special features old and new) on 26 discs all in an exclusive collectible set, and for a very reasonable price!

Previous Special Features include:

3512854,5,B001CIOCHQ,"Are you one of the millions who remember when Bill Cosby's ""The Cosby Show"" premiered like it was yesterday? I sure am. Because it was one of those perennial television shows that everyone loved and still loves. Every week like clockwork my family and I would all sit down together and put channel 4 on to watch this work of art. How many other TV shows can the entire family watch together? IMO ""The Cosby Show"" is just as important as anything that was ever produced for education-TV.

""The Cosby Show"" is absolutely the first (and the best) depiction of a real Black-American family on coast-to-coast TV. Prior to ""The Cosby Show,"" African-American sitcoms always had the buffoon character with unrealistic storylines. But ""The Cosby Show"" refused to pander to the lowest common denominator. And by doing so they became the #1 Sitcom in the country. It's because ""The Cosby Show"" said that the Black nuclear family was no different from the Chicano family or the Asian family or the Caucasian family. Maybe the main message of ""The Cosby Show"" was that in the end we all have the same problems and the same goals.

It's really difficult to say who my favorite character is on ""The Cosby Show."" The entire cast is so likeable. Watching them was like watching old friends. If I had to pick, of course first would be Cliff (played by the Cos, of course.) Because even when the kids did something wrong he was fair but very funny. And, coming in at a close second is Denise (Lilakoi Moon, more commonly known as Lisa Bonet.) Denise was always such a free spirit. And, of course I adored Mrs. Huxtable (Phylicia Rashd.) Didn't everyone wish they had a mom like her?

Also included on this set is a brand-new interview with Mr. Cosby discussing the importance and impact of his show. I look forward to owning ""The Cosby Show: 25th Anniversary Commemorative Edition"" and strongly recommend it to anyone (like myself) who is starving through this cultural famine that we call network TV in the 00's.",1221004800,18,5913,4.690453230472517
3512855,5,B001CIOCHQ,"Since I already wrote reviews for each of the eight seasons,I will not elaborate. From 1984 to '92,comedian Bill Cosby and NBC owned Thursday nights. CBS's ALL IN THE FAMILY once spent five consecutive seasons at #1,THE COSBY SHOW did the same later. TCS was meant to promote education and set examples of how family life should be.. The sitcom was inspired by Cosby's real-life family and his non-show business lifestyle. He even had some of his real-life family's names incorporated into the series,such as Cliff's father Russell,the name of one of Cosby's real-life brothers,and Cliff's mother Anna,who was his real-life mother as well. Jay Sandrich,directed Cosby on Cosby's 1969-71 series THE BILL COSBY SHOW and the two reteamed for the 1984 premiere of this series. Sandrich also previously directed many episodes of THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW,SOAP and the 1980 Chevy Chase-Goldie Hawn film SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES. Cosby,a Massachusetts resident,insisted on taping the series in New York instead of California so he wouldn't have to commute so far. So that meant convenience for New York residents Phylicia Ayers Allen and Keshia Knight Pulliam. However,Malcolm Jamal Warner and Lisa Bonet made long-distance trips from Los Angeles and Tempest Bledsoe came to New York from her native Chicago. Whitney Houston was originally chosen to play the oldset Huxtable kid Sondra,but she was concentrating on her singing career,breaking through in 1985 and later winning several Grammys. So the role went to New Orleans native Sabrina LeBeauf. TCS initially shared its Thursday evenings with Cheers and Family Ties. When TCS's spinoff A DIFFERENT WORLD premiered in 1987,FT was moved to Sundays. You'll find a multitude of famous guest stars,even singers and musicians such as Tony Orlando,Dizzy Gillespie,Lena Horne,Stevie Wonder,Sonia Braga,Robert Culp,Gilbert Gottried,Patricia Richardson,Sinbad,Debbie Allen,Sammy Davis Jr.,John Amos,Placido Domingo,Nancy Wilson(not the Heart member),Mercedes Ruehl,John Ritter,Amy Yasbeck,Miriam Makeba and others. This package contains 197 entitled episodes(some of them are approximately one hour long) that I'm sure every Bill Cosby fan will own. The next step now is releasing all four seasons of COSBY,the 1996-2000 sitcom reuniting Cosby with Phylicia Rashad*.  In 1985,PAA took football legend Ahmad Rashad to be her third husband. Phylicia retained his name after their 2001 divorce.",1217635200,12,2425,5.6256830601092895

3513013,5,B001CIOCHQ,"I am only one of many who can recount fond memories of the ritual Thursday Evening interludes with Bill Cosby's off-the-peg sweater wearing obstetrician, Heathcliff Huxtable, his attorney wife, Claire (Phyllicia Rashad), and their five children, the superachiever Sondra( Sabrina Le Beuf),free spirit Denise(Lisa Bonet), only son Theo ( Malcolm Jamal-Warner), precocious Vanessa(Tempest Bledsoe), and Keshia Knight-Pulliam as youngest daughter, Rudy.
 Happily for many, the producers of the show decided not to present the Huxtables as a blue collar family because many African Americans who other wise may not have done so began to get a different vision for their lives because of the image of this family.
 Initially based on Cosby's comedy routines, particularly his recently televised concert, ""Bill Cosby--Himself"",the show gradually  took on a life outside of that due to great script writing, creating a legacy that many still recall  fondly over two decades later.
 During eight seasons, we watched the children grow up, and the relationships of Rudy and her friend, Kenny(Deon Richmond) and Sondra and her chauvenistic suitor, Elvin( Geoffrey Owens) evolve, and new cast members such as  naval officer Martin Kendall(Joseph C. Phillips, who initially appeared on the show as a prospective rival of Elvin's for Sondra's affections), and his daughter, Olivia ( Raven-Symone), gain audience approval. Earle Hyman and Clarice Taylor played Cliff's loving parents,Russell and Anna, deftly helping to promote the image of a loving, close-knit family.
  Through many a comedic episode, audiences were treated to a barrage of talented actors of all races and creeds, including Erika Alexander as Cousin Pam, Robin Givens as a friend of Denise's, Blair Underwood as the boyfriend of Robin Given's character,Adam Sandler as Theo's friend, Smitty,  Wallace Shawn as neighbor, Jeffrey Engels, William Thomas Jr. as Vanessa's fiance Dabnis Brickey, Naomi Campbell as Theo's fellow college student, Julia,Carl Anthony PayneII as Theo's good buddy, Walter ""Cochroach"" Bradley, Sonia Braga as Theo's teacher, Mrs. Westlake, a young Alicia Keys as a slumber party guest of Rudy's,Peter Costa as Rudy's friend and occassional partner in crime, a few Muppets, and beloved seasoned Hollywood stars such as Christopher Plummer, Danny Kaye, Joe Seneca,Eileen Heckart, and Sammy Davis Jr., as well as a few musical stars such as Tito Puente, Tony, Orlando, and Placido Domingo.
  The series began with parental displeasure over Theo's poor grades in school, but along the way, the boy is discovered to be dyslexic, as was Cosby's late son, Ennis, on whom the character was based, and the series ends on the day of Theo's graduation from NYU, a fitting note on which to end.
  Thankfully, cable television still airs this beautiful groundbreaking program whose wholesome wit still endures, and which portrayed people of all races and creeds in a positive light.",1294099200,2,2947,5.43640350877193

The DVDs seem to include the complete episodes. No cuts.
The cardboard packaging is not the best. dvds get stained with black print from the cardboard package. this may scratch your dvd or, by extreme, make it unplayable.

3513046,3,B001CIOCHQ,"Anyone who is reading this review or any review about the Cosby Show, for that matter, already knows that it's a great show that teach actual life lessons without dipping into the sugar coated way tv tends to do so I won't go into that. What I will go into is the problem I encountered.

I've read past reviews about there being problems with scratches, skipping, freezing and some discs not loading. Those reviews made me leary about ordering the set but with all the reviews mentioning such problems being a good year or two old my love for the show overshadowed any doubt. Season 1 played without any problem whatsoever. It was season 2 where my problem came about. Episode 4 (Denise Drives) froze some on the ending credits but worked its way out. Episode 5 (Theo and the older woman) wouldn't load on any player I have here. Episode 6 (Halloween) froze on the intro and most of the episode, the same with episode 7 (Rudy Suits Up). Episode 8 was the first episode to play like it should. There was some stalling and freezing on various episodes on the 3rd disc of season 2 but I can't remember which ones. I did pick random episodes from the later seasons and they all played fine. There was black marks on every disc in the set but they didn't affect its playing in anyway. Some previous reviewers said it came off quite easy but I didn't try it. If the discs worked I was fine with the marks being there. After having problems with that many episodes I decided to return the set even though it was the last thing I wanted to do.

My rating of 3 stars is based on the packaging. The discs are in thin black cardboard sleeves leaving half the disc exposed to damage. As far as the problem I encountered, I can't say for sure if it had anything to do with the packaging or if the scratches on the 1st and 3rd discs were underneath the coating so I didn't base my review on that for the sole reason of not being able to say one way or another.

I also want to say Amazon did an absolutely fantastic job with handling my refund. They took care of notifying UPS to come pick it up and even sent me an email notifying me they had received the package and would send another email with other necessary material as far as handling my refund. All in all, my refund went very smoothly thanks to them.

I don't want to discourage anyone from ordering the anniversary set, I just want to make everyone aware that the problems from a year or two ago are still happening. For those who do order the set, pay close attention to each episode to make sure they play like they should. Good luck to you all.",1286755200,5,2594,4.309426229508197

BUYER BEWARE: Obviously a fantastic show, but the way in which this product is manufactured and packaged results in problems for the end user (consumer). Be advised that each DVD is not suspended in its own circular, plastic tray, as is typical of discs. Rather, the entire collection is stored in books made of thick, white cardstock that is coated with the various graphics (or printed onto) for marketing. Each page of the DVD storage books contains two horizontal slits where the bare discs are inserted halfway, thus leaving them 50% exposed to the eye when the book is opened. Particles from the graphics that are printed onto each page flake off of the edges of the slits during transit. These particles then stick to the backs of the bare discs and, as slippage occurs, it causes scratches on the backs of the discs, which is severe in some cases. All of this occurs while the contents remain sealed and unopened. I played the first disc of Season 2, and it was severely scratched. These scratches had caused the disc to become unplayable.

3513065,5,B001CIOCHQ,"I don't mean to sound harsh, but in my humble opinion most of today's TV sucks. Commedies aren't really funny anymore. Even two-and-a-half Men, which used to have me laughing my head off even despite it's more than a little sexist content, has lost a lot of the humor for me. The Cosby Show reminds me of days gone by, when commedy could be clean and still be funny. While it is true that when I ordered my copy of the 25th anniversary commemorative edition (god bless whoever decided to release this gem on DVD), at least one of the disks were damaged rendering a few episodes partially unwatchable, I've still got most of my favorites. And I may have my electronics-savy girlfriend take a look at the one disk I know for sure to be damaged and perhaps even be able to correct the problem without having to reorder.
  I remember watching The Cosby Show when I was growing up. I t was basically a family event. We'd sit down every Thursday night to watch the trials and adventures of the Huxtable family as they tried like the rest of us to get through life. It's of course well-known that the Huxtable's story bears a lot on Cosby's real life family, right down to Theo's discovery that he had Dyslexia, which the late Ennis Cosby also suffered with and eventually overcame. Much of the humor found throughout the series also comes from Cosby's own commedy routines, right down to the famous ""Push 'em out, shove 'em out, waaaay out!"" cheer which appears both on Bill Cosby's Bill Cosby Himself album and in the Cosby Show's pilot episode. All in all an excellent series well-deserving of a DVD release.",1251590400,2,1604,4.546712802768166

3513067,5,B001CIOCHQ,"I ordered this back in July and it arrived a few days earlier than I expected.  It's so nice to have the complete uncut series on DVD, especially the pilot.  ""Goodbye Mr. Fish"" is finally complete as well as ""Jitterbug Break"".  For those of you who complain about the packaging, may I suggest you invest in a CD/DVD cleaning machine.  I use one from Memorex along with a homemade cleaner of Dawn soap and alcahol which seems to do the trick.

Though TCS got a little ""preachy"" towards the end, and the storilines were weak, it still is nice to be able to pop in a disc and watch an episode from the first 3 seasons. I would definitely reccommend buying a used one  from Amazon's Marketplace.  I got mine for $78.99, less than $10/season, but you can get it even cheaper.  Enjoy!:)",1249430400,,780,4.405594405594406

If there isn't a black line going right down the side of the dvd, then the other dvd's that look flawless still have flaws.  I pretty much have those shows memorized, and from what I saw, they cut one scene which can be seen on tv in the syndicated version.  Along with that, there are several other mistakes from music that was different in the original to misprinting on the box (the colors for the printing on the box are very difficult to read) about what show is on what dvd.  Some dvd's you can't even play.  I waited so long for this series to come out, but I guess I'll have to do without it.  I wish I knew which company to call to complain about this.

Then, my husband saw this set and suggested that I buy it instead of the last two seasons individually, especially with the extras included. Imagine my TOTAL surprise and delight upon discovering the first season episodes were COMPLETE! It was like watching a new show, since editing up to four minutes was present in the previous edition of Season 1. I have not seen the show this complete since 1984. I watched it faithfully for eight seasons first-run, wished for it UNCUT on DVD, and I am THOROUGHLY enjoying this wonderful show all over again!

I own both the set and the individual box sets. If you must choose PICK THIS SET! The price is better, and if the card board sleeves bother you buy some slim cases and it still will be cheaper. Add to that the fact that in this set the seasons are uncut with scenes never shown on TV, mainly in season 1, and you'd have to be a fool not to buy this set.

3513113,5,B001CIOCHQ,"This is one of my all-time favorite, if not favorite, television shows. I remember gobbling down my dinner every Thursday to watch the show at 7pm. I remember laughing until my stomach hurt when Cliff and the men were pregnant. I remember ahhh-ing when Olivia first came on screen and won the hearts of the family. I remember crying my eyes out when the last episode aired and Cliff and Clair danced off the screen. I was watching TV Land the other night with my 7 year old niece (I am 27 now) and she and I were just laughing and laughing at the show. It's as funny, if not funnier since I am grown and can appreciate the family that I had, now as it was then. My niece even asked me if this was a new show and I told her, ""No it's not. I used to watch this show when I was your age."" ""Wow, it's really old,"" was her response.

This is back when TV was good and we didn't have the smut that is Rock of Love, Flavor of Love, the Bachelor, Family Guy, etc. You don't have to be crude, curse or insult others to be funny. I get sentimental when I think about this show because it was so much a part of my childhood. I was only 3 but I still remember the opening baseball sequence and Rudy crying out in bed sick when Cliff asked her what she wanted and she said, ""Mommy!""

3513114,4,B001CIOCHQ,"What sold me on this package is that the season 1 episodes are full length; not the uncut syndicated releases that dogged the standalone set.

What is great about this show is its family-friendly nature.  It appeals to everybody.  In ways it redefined television, but at the same time, no TV show since then has had the cleanliness Cosby had put into his show.

Of course, everybody knows all that -- what I should do is talk about the DVD release.

Sound and video quality are very good, even at 9 episodes jammed onto every disc.  The master tapes digitally remastered -- this will look and sound perfect once it's put onto blu-ray.

It's got a fair share of extras to discuss the one thing about the 1980s worth remembering (apart from Devo, oddly) and even a full color booklet with a reproduction of the pilot episode's script.  Which is nice, but...

...why not spare us the book and give some decent disc inserts?  The set is divvied up into 4 smaller booklets within the main package.  Seasons 1&2, season 3&4, 5&6, 7&8.  Each booklet has cardboard inserts that will readily scratch the disc -- BE CAREFUL WHEN HANDLING or go out and buy separate sleeves for the discs.  It is not really being green-friendly to replace solid plastic cases with cardboard ones that, after repeated viewing, make the disc unplayable and compelling to customer to buy another set, only to scratch the new discs all over again.

Season 1 sells the set.  But add another $5 in additional disc sleeves.  Even when taking mine out I saw minute scratches.  They will add up quickly and spare you hassle in the long-term.",1230422400,4,1604,4.631205673758865

8287744,3,B001CIOCHQ,"Bill Cosby was one of the first major African-American celebrities, starting in the 1960's when they were still a rarity. But while Cosby to his credit eschewed the obvious ""black"" stereotypes, the show that resulted was never anything greater than the average sitcom. You could find the same jokes and situations in many other television sitcoms of that era and before.  It may be based on the Cosby family's actual history, and it has some laughs, but it is not the fantastic program it has been hyped to be.

I did see a comic book cartoon parody of the show I found hilarious. The point was that it showed a too-clean view of a family of five. For example, a house with five children would be far messier than shown on a television show. Also, when a family doctor comes home from his office at the end of the day, he would be typically exhausted from all the screaming kids and other headaches that a family doctor goes through.

If you removed the Cosbys and substituted a white family instead, the show would hardly be different.",1414540800,,1036,4.559139784946237
