8545482,4,B004D93O5W,"This set gets a 4 because of the two workouts that were good. Supercharged and Ultimate. The one led by Allie was annoying and the instructor talks like she thinks you're in junior kindergarten.
I bought this series based on reviews of how much better it was than the BSS3 series. But despite the better set and brighter lighting I have to say that BSS3 workout with Christa Riley was a better workout than Allie's based on sequencing and the switching of step position wasn't quite as irksome.
Get this set for the other 2 workouts.",1467676800,,533,4.5625
