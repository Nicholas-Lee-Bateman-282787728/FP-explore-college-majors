8172671,5,B000MV8ARM,"Chen Kuan Tai is the master, on the run from the 3 Evils (including the man with a blade in the braid!), who have severely injured him in a scuffle. Yuen Tak (aka Yuan Tak on the back of the MediaBlaster's dvd case) plays the student who takes him in, and after being bullied continuously, the Master takes him under his wing. Overall, very good story, with some of the best actors in the genre. Lau Hok Nin is excellent as the school master who hates Chen Kuan Tai and takes it out on Yuen Tak.

Directed by Lu Chun Ku, 1980. aka 3 Evil Masters

I own the Media Blasters/ Tokyo Shock/ Celestial version that  contains two dvds, Heroes Two and The Master (aka 3 Evil Masters). The version is presented beautifully in 16:9 widescreen, with excellent audio in either English dubbing or Chinese, and there's also subtitles available. 96 minutes. The dvd quality gets a 5 out of 5. These are the best of the best-- anything by Celestial is top-notch.

The film is very good, and stars Chen Kuan Tai- one of my favorite kung fu actors (also in Opium and the Kung Fu Master with Ti Lung). Some of the dialogue is very clever, and the English dubbing made me laugh out loud more than once.

Overall, the film deserves a 4.0 out of 5 stars, but if you get the Celestial version, it's really a 4.5 out of 5. Watching old kung fu in pristine quality is what really does it for me. I highly recommend. A top 25 kung fu film in my book, and a staple of the genre.",1323820800,2,1451,4.242753623188406
