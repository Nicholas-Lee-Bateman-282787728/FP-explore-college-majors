8187889,3,B000OZ2D24,Fpr  anyone  interested  in  the  history  of  film  I  recommend  this  collection  of  Silent  Greats,1437868800,,103,5.0
8187890,5,B000OZ2D24,"Wonderful collection for anyone who loves Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or early silent films. Great price for a great collection.",1356652800,,131,5.6
8187891,3,B000OZ2D24,"I am glad I have this collection. But the pictures are not as good as what is broadcast on TCM. Blurrier and with blooming whites. For instance on Steamboat Bill Jr. which I recorded from TCM, the luggage name tag was easily readable, while not one letter could be made out from this collection. None looked restored, many were poor quality. I was hoping for better quality. Disappointed. Ah well, it was cheap for all these movies.",1341619200,3,432,4.623376623376624
8187892,3,B000OZ2D24,Delivery and all was fine.  It would have been nice to have a larger photo or some description of the video.  I didn't realize it only had Keaton and Chaplin.  It looked like an anthology with other actors as well.,1255564800,9,214,4.3
8187893,4,B000OZ2D24,"Six DVD set, B&W, 67 silent, 3 talkie films. Volume 1: Charlie's Antics. 17 short comedies. Volume 2: Classic Chaplin. 18 short films. Volume 3: Charlie Chaplin. 17 more short films. All 52 are from 1914 to 1919. Volume 4: Classic Shorts. Ten from Buster Keaton, 1921 to 1923. Volume 5, three Buster Keaton silent shorts from 1922 to 1923: The Paleface; Daydreams; Love Nest; and L'il Abner (talkie, 1940); Parlor, Bedroom and Bath (talkie, 1931); posters. Volume 6: three more from Buster Keaton: Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928); The General (1927); The Villain Still Pursued Her (talkie, 1941); Trivia Quiz.

Only Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928) and The General (1927) are worth seeing twice. Both are excellent films by Buster Keaton.",1212192000,18,727,5.058333333333334
