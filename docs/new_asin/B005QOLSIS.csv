8483525,5,B005QOLSIS,"Justine Shelton is a magnificent teacher. I am a 68 year old woman who had never done yoga before and with Justine's guidance have now begun a daily yoga routine. I especially appreciate the straightforward explanations that Justine provides on this video.
It almost feels like a class designed especially for me and with the lovely background music, I actually look forward to my daily yoga practice.

I would highly recommend this video for yoga neophytes, but I would think there would be advantages for all. I would also encourage purchase of this video to those who are unable to attend a yoga class either due to finances, proximity of classes or time constraints. This video is so well explained that you can start your yoga practice immediately upon receiving this DVD.

Thank you, Justine.",1346889600,,798,4.9037037037037035
