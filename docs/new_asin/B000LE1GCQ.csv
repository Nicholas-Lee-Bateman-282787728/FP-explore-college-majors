8323577,1,B000LE1GCQ,This DVD was not what I was looking for. I wanted hardcore porn and it was barely soft core. I threw it away.,1387238400,,109,3.782608695652174
8323578,1,B000LE1GCQ,"THIS IS THE BIGGEST RIP-OFF EVER! THIS DVD SHOWS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL, I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK FOR THESE, AND YOU SHOULD VIEW THESE YOURSELVES AND SEE WHAT A FARSE THESE REALLY ARE! NEVER AGAIN!",1384214400,,202,4.486486486486487
8323579,5,B000LE1GCQ,"This is one of the best Peach DVDs I've ever seen, and I've got no qualms with anything unless it's that I would have liked to have seen more of Jaime Hammer's uh...peach.

Ten girls with a good run time of just more than an hour. A couple of the vignettes feel a little long, but then again I felt a little long after seeing Hammer's vignette which even though it is less explicit than  all of the rest...my god, you'll just have to see her. If you're unfamiliar with her (she's the one on the cover), she has an incredible all-natural body that moves and undulates like a turbulent sea.

You also get a good mixture of petite (Teanna Kai) and statuesque (Rachel Elizabeth), and everybody shows every inch although Hammer doesn't let us see every inch for the same duration.

There's a strip sequence near the end with one of the models--unsure of her name--and WOW! More explicit than anything else that I've seen from  Peach.

Can't go wrong with this one if you like this genre. One of the best out there.",1279497600,,1009,4.427027027027027
