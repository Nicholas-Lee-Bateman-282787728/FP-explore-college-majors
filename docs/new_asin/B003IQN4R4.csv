It ia a highly entertaining travaloge of the hosts visits to eating establishment across America and his encounters with the cooks at these Dinners Drive-Ins and Dives.  Fun to watch.",1335571200,,279,4.914893617021277
4127932,3,B003IQN4R4,"Bought this a few months back. I really feel cheated! This season contained only 2 disks instead
of 3. Less episodes! Quality of the shows just as good as the rest of the seasons, but just I can't help the feeling I got ripped off! Also how about some more seasons? There has to be more out there.
There are lots of episodes shown and repeated many times on TV that are not any of my DVDs.",1317513600,,389,4.064935064935065
4127933,5,B003IQN4R4,"This is a great tv show,I love it. I was going to record it to my dvr , But that would inclued those silly commercials which i can't stand anyway. Guy is a great host for this tv series, He seems to be a fun loving person and down to earth. Most of the time when i watch it i get hungry,looking at all that good food in front of me. I would say this is the best show on the Food Network,Well worth watching time and again. I also enjoy unwrapped and Bobby Flay's throwdown.",1300492800,4,473,3.9375

8397661,5,B003IQN4R4,We have decided to always purchase these in DVD for all of Guy's seasons. There are weekends where we just put them on and watch them back to back!! We used on on Food Network but got so tired of the millions of commercials!! This way we are able to go from show to show at our whim. Love Guy!!!!,1355011200,2,296,3.95

8397663,4,B003IQN4R4,"I don't have cable-TV, just a TV antenna. I learned about this series from a friend after we talked about a similar set of shows on PBS by Rick Sebak.

I was a tiny bit put off at first by the California looks of the host. I was also on guard because I have seen hosts of similar shows act rude towards people asking embarrassing questions. This guy comes close a couple times but is mostly respectful, rather funny and probably well schooled in the restaurant business.

He travels the USA covering restaurants from hole-in-the-wall places to well established eateries with long standing reputations. The program is mostly filmed inside kitchens and shows little snippets of how the best of them became the best, their magic, and their enthusiasm.

Don't watch this just before heading to the grocery store. But it is great for planning trips to distant places or searching for home cooking ideas. Well worth watching over and over. I didn't give it the highest reviews because the video quality is not very good.",1348358400,,1014,4.75
