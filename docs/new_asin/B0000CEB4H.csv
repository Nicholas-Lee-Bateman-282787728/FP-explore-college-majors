7999149,2,B0000CEB4H,I bought this because it was recommended for little kids. It comes on very colorful getting my 3 year old's interest but when the dark scenes came on she lost interest. This is not a video for the young toddlers at all. Don't let the colorful fish fool you because the dark scenes are much to long and not portrayed in and understanding way for a toddler. They loose interest before they can even begin to get the message of the video.,1483056000,,435,4.317073170731708

7999151,5,B0000CEB4H,"My kiddoes love these, and the Humpty Dumpty cartoon is really neat. I'd never heard the story. All of the episodes have great songs, great messages, and great analogies that give a good opportunity for ""how does that remind us of God"" discussions, even with littles.",1440806400,,267,4.826086956521739

7999153,4,B0000CEB4H,My 2 year old enjoyed these little adventures. Its no Finding Nemo but she watched them daily until the discs disappeared. I'm sure she hid them in her room somewhere. Cant beat the price for a couple months of entertainment though.,1398988800,,232,4.682926829268292

MY GRANDSON LOVES THE SONGS
THE SOUND EFFECTS
AND ALL THE BRIGHT COLORS
HIGHLY RECOMMEND !",1396396800,,116,4.318181818181818
7999155,5,B0000CEB4H,Both kids loved it. 3 and 5 yrs old. Mommy had to watch it and actually ended up enjoying it so definitely glad I got it for them because I am not too happy with the things shown on TV theses days.,1354406400,,197,3.7142857142857144
7999156,5,B0000CEB4H,This is a double feature and very good to show kid's how much God loves them,1259625600,3,76,3.8125
7999157,4,B0000CEB4H,"This is a children's CG film, that has a strong message in morals.  It uses a clown fish as its main character...which our grandchildren always associated with Nemo.  There are a couple of songs scattered here and there which the children also enjoy.  There is one scene in the episode entitled ""The Red Tide""... where there is a ""bad guy"" who is represented a little ""dark"" for younger viewers.  It is to emphasize that they are bad, however, I could understand if a child became fearful at seeing this.  It didn't seem to bother my grandchildren...so I definately wouldn't refrain from getting it simply because of this.  You could always fast forward the part if you think your child might be concerned,  however, there is a second episode on there called ""The Gift"" and there is nothing in that to be considered disturbing.  A definate positive addition to any Christian's home video collection!",1252368000,6,899,4.830065359477124
