5084339,4,B007FZ7LOG,"I just received the new Image Entertainment release of the Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin.  I wanted to compare it to the Mill Creek release.  There are good and bad things to compare.  Without question the video and audio on the new release seem better - the audio is louder and the screen caps don't seem to have as many artifacts.  I haven't watched every episode yet, but it seems there's definitely less compression of the video.  The video does, however, seem softer and not as sharp.  The new discs are in two cases that come in one large box.  If you take them out of the box, they will fit on a normal DVD shelf with the rest of your discs, though the large box they come in is pretty cute, especially with the nice map of Grundo on the front leaf.

There is an episode numbering problem printed on the box containing the first set of discs.  The episode number 11 is skipped (episodes are labeled 10. The New MAVO Member followed by 12. The Faded Fobs (actually number 11) and the numbering problem persists through all the episodes listed on the first box - episode 36 is listed as Escape from MAVO (actually episode 35).  The episode number 36 is repeated for the first episode (actual number 36, Leekee Lake) on the second box.  Let me clarify - the episodes are all there in the correct order.  They are just mislabeled on the box.

The other source of awkwardness is the distribution of episodes across discs.  The story in Teddy Ruxpin is told in 5-episode storylines.  There are 6-7 episodes per disc.  This means that most stories are split across discs - for example, there are 7 episodes on the first disc, so the first storyline (The Treasure of Grundo to Escape from the Treacherous Mountains) is on disc 1 along with the first two episodes of the next week's story, and the remaining three episodes of that week are on the second disc.  One thing the Mill Creek discs have going for them - the storyline breaks between discs make more sense with 10 episodes/disc for the first 4 discs (still screwy for the last two discs though).  The ideal situation would have been to have five episodes per disc, which would have been 13 discs instead of 10, but oh well.

Once again, the title cards from the commercial breaks are not included (the ""We'll be right back"" and ""And now back to Teddy Ruxpin"" parts).

The biggest negative, compared to the Mill Creek release, is the lack of chapter breaks on the new discs.  The Mill Creek release had a chapter break after the opening credits, at the halfway point of the episode, and before the ending credits.  The new discs have no extra chapter breaks - you can only skip to the beginning of each episode.  Still, overall I'm happy with the new release.",1349913600,15,2712,4.489795918367347
5084340,5,B007FZ7LOG,"I am sure if you are here you're a Teddy Ruxpin fan or curious about this show. Well you've hit the right link because this is the Teddy Ruxpin set to buy. The previous Teddy Ruxpin complete set was spread across 6 discs by Mill Creek, this set it's spread over 10 discs.

You get all 65 episodes in their full glory, just like you remember from 1987, Teddy Ruxpin was the best selling toy of 1986 and then came this great cartoon which its plot was spread across all 65 episodes to a satisfying ending. Take it from someone who owns this set the price is right, it'll make a great stocking stuffer or a good present for a Teddy Ruxpin fan. Most of these reviews are from the old Teddy set I mentioned on 6 discs, Amazon has a very bad HABIT of transferring old reviews from previous sets and sticking them on the new editions which helps no one! I don't know if Amazon is ever going to end this practice but at least you can pin the newest release date of a set to the reviews after that date and see it's a review for the new set. I was pleased with the packaging, nice and study and colorful, the price is awesome! Great job Image ent.! I wish they would release more complete sets like this of bygone cartoons we all miss seeing. This cartoon speaks for itself so I hope I was helpful on just letting you know about this latest edition.",1349395200,21,1340,4.1937984496124034

5084353,5,B007FZ7LOG,"This is simply one of the best cartoon series for the 4-8 year old crowd out there.

The episodes have likeable characters (even the bad guys are fun) that are involved in interesting challenges that parallel the kinds of choices and challenges kids face.

The quality of the animation and voice acting are consistently high.

One caution: if you are expecting Anime/Manga level of animation, er, no it is not that.  If you are looking for 2.5 D quality then no, it is not that.  If you compare it to cartoons from 90s then this is on the high end.

These teach the right lessons without being preachy.",1416700800,2,602,4.527777777777778

5084355,5,B007FZ7LOG,"WOW! This set is GREAT! Obviously, some features might have been desirable, but considering that the show was over a quarter century old when this set was released, we ought to be grateful to have it at all. Mill Creek Entertainment released the came content: all 65 episodes of this series, on a similar set a few years ago, which will do just as well, but this one contains more discs so the videos are less compressed, and it also comes in several nice, chunky boxes with lots of really cool artwork. I'm a sucker for that stuff.

If you don't remember this series, please don't write it off! Based on the hit talking toy, this series went way beyond its origins in offering some serious character development and a broad, interesting world for the characters to inhabit, plus some plot twists that made a jaded twenty-something drop his jaw. It might seem very ""kiddy"" in places, but give the narrative some time to unfold. not until Adventure Time has a children's series contained this much breadth and depth. Of course, by the time you get really into, the series will end in a cliffhanger. Just so you now. Enjoy.",1407542400,3,1121,4.605

5084363,4,B007FZ7LOG,"I loved Teddy Ruxpin when I was a kid. Though, I was more familiar with the live action movie. I had never seen the cartoon. Of if I had, I didn't remember it beyond some of the same story that was used in the live action movie. The show is a lot of fun. Sure, the animation can be a bit limited, but you don't really notice it after a while. The only thing that could make this set better would be if there was some sort of bonus features. The video quality, for the most part, is that of a very high quality VHS tape....which is fine. It reminds me of the quality of video in the 80s when I was a kid, which is nice.

The only bad thing about the set is the way it's packaged. The discs are stuck on little rubber nubs instead of the standard plastic dvd nubs. When the discs are in the cardboard trays, they sit right against the cardboard. This is a big no-no for anyone that knows about dvds and movies. My set didn't have any major damage, and the discs seem to play fine...so far. It would have been MUCH better had the discs been in standard plastic keepcases.....NOT stacked on top of each other as sets like these tend to do.",1381795200,,1135,4.089686098654709

This 10 disc collection is a must have for any 80's baby collector or fan of teddy or parent with child who wants a show with GOOD animation and heart to show their kids. The boxset is packaged really interesting, it is made out of a recycled paper that is condensed and becomes heavy and solid like wood. This thing weighs like 3 pounds I think. There is literally no plastic to this box-set it is all biodegradable paper product with ink. I don't know how I feel about my discs touching rough cardboard like paper so I'll put them in a dvd album, but they arrived unscathed so no fear about receiving scratched discs or anything. But I feel like If I was to keep watching them and putting them in and out of the paper boxes that might cause scratching",1371859200,,860,4.25

5084368,5,B007FZ7LOG,"Come Dream with me Tonight. I can dream with this Bear all over again now.

When I was a little kid, I use to watch a lot of good shows on TV, back in the 80's; 1984 was the year I was born, and this was released on TV a few years after. Of all the DVD Box Sets I've seen, and or gotten, THIS one is much different from the others; what I mean by that is that it holds two DVD Boxes in one WHOLE box, and holds them side by side. Even though this box mentions a brief history of the famous interactive talking Toy Bear that inspired this show, it doesn't, unlike some DVD boxes, or so I hear rumors about, tell you that they'd be available in the same place where you would buy this. Seeing as how you can now try to find the toy bear here at Amazon, and at an expensive price, I can see why this bear, in toy form, would be a bit hard to find, and buy.

This bears (no offense, or pun intended) similarities to Seasons 1 & 2 of He-Man, Season 1 of She-Ra, and the Complete Series of both Filmation's Ghostbusters, and Bravestar, because of the fact that this TV Series ran for a total of 65 Episodes. I only watched the first 5 DVDs in Volume 1, starting with the first 5 Episodes that tell a 5-Part Story, but I plan to start watching Volume 2 sometime soon.

Bottom line, I'm taking a trip down memory lane with this special bear, and I am loving every minute of it. In fact, on YouTube, courtesy of a new friend of mine, I like listening to his special lullaby song called, ""Will You Go To Sleep Before I Do"", and it seems to be my favorite, probably because this bear was my favorite bear, and I haven't seen him, or heard his songs, including that one, in such a long time.

My vote of 5 stars for this musical, story-telling bear. The adventures in Grundo await.

UPDATE: I have finished watching all 65 episodes of this show, and am happy to say that although it left me wondering what would've happened next, I liked how it turned out. Unfortunatelly, before I continued, and finished watching this, a canine member of our Family had gone, and left us. A passing vehicle took her life away. So I decided to finish watching this is honor of her. I miss her...very much.",1362355200,,2177,4.149289099526066

5084370,5,B007FZ7LOG,"Once upon a time as a young lad, I had a faithful friend in Teddy Ruxpin. Like many young children of that golden era known as the 80s, my talking friend kept me and my friends entertained for countless hours. And then, much to the collective joy and excitement of so many, it was revealed that Teddy Ruxpin would be receiving his very own cartoon show. There was much exuberance in the depths of my young heart. However, when the show began to hit the airwaves, I was devastated to discover that it was placed in a time slot in which I would be unable to make it home in time from school. Every day I would run home as fast as I could, only to turn on the TV just in time for the end credits. Curse those big shot TV producers and their idiotic scheduling! If only I was old enough to know how to program the VCR! And so I never really got to see Teddy's cartoon show, other than the first pilot episodes which were often aired on Saturdays to attract viewers.

Decades past. Finally, one day as an adult I manage to acquire the complete series of Teddy Ruxpin cartoons. With waited anticipation I slowly begin my journey through all 65 episodes. I expected a nice little trip down the memory lane of my childhood. Instead, I received so much more.

Teddy Ruxpin is (and I'm saying this as an adult here*) a phenomenal work in writing and storytelling. Yes, I realize I'm talking about a children's cartoon from the 80s, but this is no ordinary children's show. I was constantly amazed at the world that these people created, and the creativity that went into it. I found myself constantly looking forward to the next episode, excited to see what these writers decided to develop next in this colorful Land of Grundo.

THIS is the kind of creative and inspiring story telling that I wish there was more of for today's youth. They just don't make them like this anymore. It is a truly impressive body of work.

I highly recommend the Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin to old fans, new fans, and anyone who enjoys well crafted storytelling and creativity. I finally got to see it for the first time as an adult, and I was seriously impressed. Go buy it. Buy it for your kids. Heck, buy it for yourself. You can all enjoy this one.

*Disclaimer: I realize that the fact that I am a grown adult reviewing a children's cartoon from the 80s may somewhat tarnish my credibility with some readers... So let me state for the record that I am not a crazed or rabid fanboy. I don't live with my parents. I have a job and I'm actually a pretty cool guy. The show really is just that good. So there ya go.",1353974400,35,2586,4.345755693581781
5084371,4,B007FZ7LOG,I recently bought the complete adventures of teddy ruxpin. This was my favorite show when i was a child. I totally recommend this for any fan of the show or anyone who wants their kids to watch real cartoons. I do have one complaint and its that this technically isn't complete.... yes all the episodes are here but there was actually a 1 hour live action pilot that sets up the cartoon with people in costumes and is actually my favorite part of the whole series. I feel cheated by the false advertisement of this. If you buy just know the live action movie is not included.
