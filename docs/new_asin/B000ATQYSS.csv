2393074,5,B000ATQYSS,"Honestly, I never thought this would be the type of show I'd even want to watch, much less had to watch. But one night, nothing else was on, and decided to give it a try. Instantly became hooked. As others have mentioned, it's a reality show in which true talent wins out. Backbiting, gamesmanship, etc. is still present, and makes for interesting TV. But in the end, either you've got the talent to make it, or you don't. I eagerly anticipated the release of Season 1, so that I could catch up on the ones I'd missed. Am enjoying Season 2 on Bravo, but can't wait for it to come out on DVD, so I can watch at my leisure.",1138579200,6,621,4.183333333333334
2393075,5,B000ATQYSS,"Couldnt stop watching this DVD. Finished the last episode with a headache (3 am) but with a smile on my face! Sometimes the personalities of the contestants on a reality TV gameshow dictate the contents of the episodes and the friction created between the various people competing - and this is precisely what happened here, making VERY GOOD TV and wonderful entertainment up to the very end. I also loved the ""where are they now"" section on the extras of this DVD. If you like shows like Amazing Race, Survivor and The Apprentice you will LOVE this one!",1137628800,7,554,4.663265306122449
2393076,5,B000ATQYSS,"As a reality show junkie, I was skeptical that this show would offer anything new.  Unlike other shows, the participants are judged on their talent alone.  Backstabbing and plotting, which has become commonplace in other shows, will not save you here.  As one designer will eventually discover...what goes around, comes around.

Another thing to note, Heidi Klum carries herself gracefully and isn't in your face, like other models with reality shows.  She isn't building herself up and she never acts fake to impress other people.

This show was nominated for an Emmy after the first season.  Trust me; it is the greatest reality show ever.  If you live for fashion, you will appreciate the talent and technique on this program.  It was unbelievable to watch these designers bring material to life in just a few hours.  I gained enormous respect with anyone with the ability to sew and design.  I cannot wait until season two!  December 7 is marked on my calendar in INK.",1132704000,19,972,4.859756097560975
2393077,5,B000ATQYSS,"The 12 designers have stand-out personalities that draw you in immediately, even if you don't have a clue about (or even an interest in) fashion. Each week the designers are given a challenge (such as buying their supplies from ONLY a grocery store with only $50 to make their first piece).  They are put to the test both creatively and technically with each new challenge (such as redesigning the US Postal Service uniform or creating the perfect Grammy dress), and it gets really funny and bitchy at times.  For each challenge, the designers are allowed to choose a model with whom to work by pulling numbers out of a hat to determine the order in which they get to choose, with the winner of the last challenge getting first choice.  Each week, not only is one designer cut, but a model will be sent home as well.  The top three designers go on to show their unique lines at New York's Fashion Week.  The winner of that competition, as well as his/her model, receives impressive opportunities in the fashion industry!

The designers are judged by such fashion icons as Michael Kors, as well as world-famous supermodel Heidi Klum and occasional celebrity judges.  The pieces they create range from funky to formal, simple to elaborate, extravagent to the completely outrageous!

I highly recommend this DVD, along with all the extras.  There is no other reality show that can compare to Project Runway.  It's really fun to root for your favorite designer, and you'll really feel for each one when they get cut.

2393081,2,B000ATQYSS,"First season I bought..EVERY disc skipped, no matter how much I cleaned them or what player I used. So I had a replacement sent...and then none of those discs would play AT ALL! Not sure what the problem is with this season because I purchased all the other seasons as well and they work fine. I only give it an extra star because Amazon made the return easy and hassle free with tge refund. Also...I love the show lol",1454284800,3,418,4.30379746835443
2393082,5,B000ATQYSS,"The first season of PR was such a delight: the designers had no idea what to expect and every episode was a fresh surprise. Heidi plays hostess in showing the designers the workroom and the runway area, and the overall pace is more relaxed than in recent years. The models play a huge part of the initial seasons and enhance the mix of personalities and drama in and out of Parsons. The designers are allowed to drink and go out dancing and generally bring much humor to the challenges. Do yourself a favor and watch the first 3 seasons to see why people fell in love with this program!",1452729600,6,586,4.385321100917431

2393084,5,B000ATQYSS,"The start of it all.  Was a really good season.  I did like the designers, even Wendy Pepper.  I think her big problem was her insecurity as a designer.  This led her to make a couple of mistakes (a couple!)  in interacting with people.  I don't think she deserved the big freeze-out, especially when you saw the little stunt that Kara Saun pulled with her custom made, free shoes, and her entitled attitude about them.

Tim Gunn, always a delight, is barely present, only says ""Make it work"" once, and never says to use the Banana Republic wall thoughtfully. Annoying, choppy editing job using lots of stills. Way too much emphasis on the model drama. I'm just glad it got renewed!

2393162,4,B000ATQYSS,"What's interesting is that I first checked out this show because of a poll I did. I typically do watch lots of Bravo's shows but hadn't checked this one out yet, so when I did a survey which addressed Project Runway in detail, it made me really want to watch it then. And it's been one of my favorite TV programs ever since. You don't have to be a fashionista to be interested in a design competition. Whether official or not, we're all movie critics & food critics etc because we know what WE like. I was surprised a certain someone made it to the finale, even though I liked the final collection, & disappointed when a specific someone didn't. As far as the DVD goes, the background music plays too often & too loud in comparison to the talking taking place, which is a bit frustrating. And it'd be nice if the Wear Are They Now special feature was more current to this release than just shortly following the season's end.",1369612800,3,925,4.383720930232558

2393220,5,B000ATQYSS,"I don't sew, but I adore this show!

Each season begins with approximately 12-16 up-and-coming fashion designers selected to compete for the opportunity to design a show for Fashion Week in Bryant Park of New York City. Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints. The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).

In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show. The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!"" And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques. And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.

But at the core of it all is the fashion. It is really interesting to watch the clothes come to life in each challenge, culminating in a runway show.

Pulled an all-nighter and had a blast watching how it all began and comparing it to how it works now (Heidi doesn;t do as much personal greeting, Tim is smoother but still right on the mark, the basement where it all began looks so pedestrian!)The whole Wendy drama was a bit much & at the end-- SPOILER ALERT-- I really thought Kara should have been disqualified or penalized more heavily for the way she cheated with the shoes. It's tough to make Wendy look sympathetic but Kara did that with the way she handled the shoe issue. Wendy called her out and she was spot on. I don;t think Kara would have been allowed to get away with this on later shows. But I guess since Jay won it was a mute point. Tim did his best to level the playing field--and the show must go on.

Each and every challenge is full of thrilling suspense and laugh-out-loud comedy, along with some with some heart-stopping drama. It is impossible to stop watching this show once you get caught up with it. It is really fun to watch how the designers have to improv. models and the whole Wendy crisis. You really feel like you have to back up your favorite contestant or boo the one you like less, especially in the whole get. together meeting episode were all the designers come together and talk about what happened in the show.

2393280,3,B000ATQYSS,"I watched the 1st season of Project Runway for the first time just today.  I had never even heard of the show until last month (no cable) so I watched the 2nd season to try it out.  Because of watching it I knew how the first season ended, but decided to watch it anyway because I liked the designers in the 2nd season.  Well, I wasn't impressed with the first season and my main bother was, why did all the designers hate Wendy?  I honestly watched the whole season and was mystified at the complete hatred that the show, viewers and even reviewers on this site had to Wendy.  What exactly was it that she did that was so awful? ***Spoiler Alert***I can only conceive of two instances - when she dissed two of her fellow designers on the runway.  However the first was required and the second was true.  So, where was all the manipulation that was spoken of and that warranted them saying she didn't have a soul and being ""the evil one""?  I found this whole situation of exaggerated emotions completely ridiculous and contrived.  I'm not ignorant, I know the situation was drawn out by the producers, but it mystifies me that hardly anyone seems to see that. Wendy is STILL the evil one, even after all these years though there is nothing there really to show why she is.  Any negative remark she made is zeroed on, while whatever her fellow contestants said that wasn't positive was brushed off or considered deserved.  I had to laugh when at the ""reunion"" the general opinion of Wendy was very negative when the majority of the designers weren't even on the show anymore when the hostility really started to grow.  The negative opinions weren't contrived because of actual fact, but because it was a popularity contest.  If Wendy hadn't beat out Austin as the final three, who was the wonder boy and fave of the season, I know they wouldn't have wasted so much negative emotion on her.",1256515200,4,1888,4.533923303834809

Whether it's Austin Scarlett's dreamy garments or Kara Saun's tasteful, elegant clothing, the fashion in this season is as fantastic as the characters are dramatic.  The only of my top Project Runway moments that is not in this season is, you guessed it, when Austin reappears as a guest judge in Season 6.",1255910400,,468,4.825

2393286,5,B000ATQYSS,"I was immediately hooked when I caught some re-runs of this show on Bravo, and decided to buy the DVDs...ALL OF THEM! As an artist and photographer, I was immediately captured by the premise of the creative challenges presented to the budding designers each week. Heidi Klum is the attractive hostess of the show, ably supported by Tim Gunn, the Director of the renowned Parsons New School of Design. 12 hopeful designers start off the competition, and are eliminated one at a time each week after they are evaluated by judges (including designer Michael Kors & Nina Garcia from Elle Magazine) on the runway for their fashion creations. Some of the creative challenges include using things purchased at a grocery store to create a dress, re-designing the uniform of a postal worker (after spending a day in the field wearing the uniform), and working with the models (who also get eliminated one at a time each week) to create the model's ideal wedding gown. Reality TV is usually about the drama and contrived situations; do they exist here? Sure, however, it is refreshing to see that the majority of the show is about design and critiquing the unique creations that the designers whip up...and I do mean whip, as each challenge is done with very little lead time. The last 3 ""survivors"" get to exhibit an entire line at New York's Fashion week (actress Parker Posey sits in as one of the judges), with the grand prize including a photo spread in Elle Magazine and $100k in funding to create their own design line of clothes.

Extras on the DVD include ""Wear Are They Now"" featurettes for the final 5 designers; deleted scenes (which are best watching AFTER you watch the episodes, as they show further behind-the-scenes antics of the 12 contestants); a design photo gallery for all 12 designers.

An excellent set for up-and-coming designers as well as models. This show is a class act that rarely gets bogged down in the emotional drama (although there are a few choice scenes!).",1218844800,,1983,4.795321637426901
2393287,5,B000ATQYSS,"I gotta start off by saying that my family lives in that dark netherworld of people who refuse to pay for cable, so we see everything ""late"" - when it comes out on DVD. Thus, we were early devotees of ""American's Next Top Model,"" which was fun for a while, but grew old quick. Meanwhile, our friends were telling us how fab ""Project Runway"" was, and we had to smile our tight little, sad smiles and nod our heads politely and wait 'til the darn thing came out on disc.

FINALLY, we watched Season One, and boy what a grrrreat show this is!!  Unlike ""Top Model"" (with which you have to compare it) ""Runway"" isn't gimmicky or dumbed-down -- instead of putting its contestants in silly situations that or having their ""professional"" critiques be dominated by catty comments (ala Tyra's show), ""Runway"" is an actual test of skill, and places real demands on the contestants that really show their abilities, often to an astonishing degree. More than that, since it is a contest of skill -- social and sartorial -- there's an actual chance that the people you like might actually win, whereas in ""Top Model,"" it's always the lamest person who wins in the end.

""Runway"" is a great show -- our friends were right; we were wrong.  I'm big enough to admit it.

...But we're still not gonna pay for cable.

As a custom clothing maker, Project Runway re-ignites my desire to create and I enjoy watching other creative people work through their unique challenges. The extended, behind the scenes episodes flesh out the episodes from tv and give you more insight to the creative process. I think the following seasons are much better than the first season, of course they worked out the kinks and Heidi is much more comfortable in her role in the more recent seasons. All in all, it is enjoyable for any fan of the show. One warning tho, it does contain a little more language and a few obscene gestures than allowed on the commercial television episodes.

14 aspiring fashion designers are picked out of thousands to be on the show and to prove that they are talented enough to be a top designer. The way to stay in the game is to be a quick thinker, creative, and calm under pressure.

The show is set up somewhat like Top Chef (which is why I love it) where the contestants are given challenges to complete in a small amount of time (such as two days) which range from glamorous (making a Grammy outfit) to crazy (make an outfit from items in a grocery store.) The best stay and the worst ""are out.""

As in any competitive show like this one, drama always ensues. There are  fights, crying episodes and people cracking under pressure.

2393336,5,B000ATQYSS,"I am a huge Project Runway fan and have loved every season in its own right.  But season 1 keeps pulling me back in.  It's not like other shows where I get bored when I already know the outcome - the contestants themselves make such great TV that it doesn't even have to be about the fashion.  Who can resist such deliciously sarcastic Jay commentary?  Austin is a marvel every time he appears on screen, more fabulous each time.  And Wendy...  what can one say about Wendy Pepper?  I can only sit back and marvel at the sheer magnitude of her ambition.  She's easy to hate, but as a mom, I related to her in parts at the end of the show, leaving me in an uncomfortably ambiguous state of mind about Wendy.
Let's not forget dear Kara Saun... daring yet sophisticated style, no shenanigans tolerated...and then SHOEGATE!  Between her blowup with Wendy and the Shoegate saga, I could watch that last episode a hundred times.

Don't forget Robert, admirer of women...and their bodies.  Poor Kevin, one of Wendy's ""bus"" victims... Vanessa ""I CON'T SEW"" - her performance at the reunion show is pretty memorable.  Stand in awe as Austin himself does a turn on the runway, goggle at the terror that is Morganza, gasp in shock when Wendy is chosen for the final 3, sending Austin (fabulous Austin) home... clutching one of the most gorgeous dresses made that season, laugh helplessly at the sharp wit from Jay...

It's entertaining, and the more you like ""drama"" the more you will like the show.  Some of the smallest things get blown so out of proportion, and that's just more entertainment for us.

2393394,5,B000ATQYSS,"I got hooked on Project Runway in Season Three, and as that season wound down I turned to previous seasons to keep my addiction fed.  I wasn't expecting much since anyone with even a passing PR acquaintance knows who won Season 1 and the runners up who went to Fashion Week.  Nevertheless I found the season fascinating and addictive and even a bit suspenseful.

PR in season 3 really had a fairly high caliber of competition, a bigger budget and higher profile sponsors.  It was very interesting watching the show find its footing in the first season.  There were some favorite challenges like the Postal Uniform one, and the Look of the Future where they had to design an entire collection for 2055.  And of course there were the two who made the whole season worth watching--Jay with his snark and big gay fabulousness and Wendy Pepper with her combination of ruthlessness and wanting to be looooved.  She is definitely a love-to-hate reality show character!

Some of the suspense is inevitably lost, of course, by knowing how it all turned out, but watching the various people get there is still great entertainment.  Also, I didn't know enough to know the order of how all the lesser also-rans went out, so some of the elimination segments were still nail-biters for me as I rooted for people who I knew didn't go all the way to at least get past that round.

If you have never watched PR and want to know what all the hoopla is about, why not start at the beginning?  And if you came to the show later, it is worth going back and seeing the earlier shows even if you know the outcome.  Definitely recommended!",1163635200,3,1615,4.569444444444445

2393397,5,B000ATQYSS,"What sets ""Project Runway"" apart are innovative contests - the first project (called ""Innovation"") sets the tone, as it actually involves the designers going to a grocery store with $50 and being required to build an outfit out of things they find at the store. The challenges during the series are just that - challenges; they don't take it easy on the contestants and require definite skill to succeed. The results of the tasks are definitely interesting to see, as there are some that are remarkably creative, and others that just don't work.

Another refreshing point about ""Runway"" is although there are definitely big personalities in the pool of contestants and the show does show some catfights and arguments, the series focuses more on the actual work that the contestants are trying to do. Additionally, some of the people are actually pleasant to one another, which is a real shocker for a reality series. Additionally, Heidi Klum actually makes a very good host, managing to not keep the focus on her in her scenes, and yet not be so subdued that she becomes a non-factor. It's a tough balance, but she achieves it quite well. The pacing and documentary-style cinematography are also faster and sharper than most similar shows on TV today.

Extra Features

The bonus features are fun, included is a series of rather interesting ""WEAR Are They Now?"" segments, as well as deleted ""SEAMS"" and a pictorial gallery of some of the designers work throughout the course of the show. The ""WEAR"" segment catches up with Jay, Kara Saun, Austin, Robert, and Wendy. Totaling 40 minutes in length (all combined) I found these to be fairly interesting, offering a rather extensive look into what the designers have been doing since the show's conclusion. The deleted scenes (with a total run time of 15 minutes) offer the typical helping of ""the stuff we didn't show"" scenes where the camera was too shaky for the footage to make the final cut.  Lastly, the designer gallery is simply a slide show of the designers work including final products of clothing they made, as well as looks at sketches of ideas that they may have had during the creative design process. There are no audio commentaries on this disc set but hopefully there will be one in a future season release.

I really enjoy watching Runway, although I do not always agree with the voted off designer, it remains an edgy an innovative show. I think that just might be the charm of the show.  We all have our personal favorites but you can never be sure who will win !!

First of all, it is a competition based on true talent and skill - there is no faking it in these challenges - either you can put together a garment or you can't.

You'll find yourself rooting for some designers and booing others (you who have already seen season one know who the ""evil"" designer is). If i can sum up PR Season one in two words they would be: AUSTIN SCARLETT! He is outrageous on so many levels (check the hair), yet he has that certain cult-of-personality thing going on.

If you have never watched Project Runway and are at all interested in the creative process or what it takes to be a designer, this is a show for you.  I was once an art school major and it totally reminds me of when I had to scramble together a design project along with my other classmates (there was definitely the pull and balance of competition vs. helping each other out, racing against the clock and trying to create something which met the criteria for each design challenge but still was true to your own creative concepts).  The criticism of the show which is totally valid is that the Producers had the final say who would and wouldn't get eliminated - so really the best designers don't end up in the final 3.  The Producers are more worried about making the show more ""interesting"" by keeping enough tension and drama in the show.  I think they would have been better off just letting things happen without their interference - I really wanted to see the 3 best designer's collections at the end so that was a major disappointment - DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU NEVER SAW THE SHOW, it will ruin the ending for you...

On the DVD, I wish they had included the fourth runner-up's collection who apparently agreed to put together a collection using his own money because the final competition in real time preceded the airing of the final competition.  In my opinion and in many other viewers' opinions, the fourth runner-up should have made it to the final three instead of Wendy - it was so obvious that the Producers forced the judges to keep her in because she created so much tension in the show.",1140393600,5,1767,4.415384615384616
