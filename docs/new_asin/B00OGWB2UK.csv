6750268,4,B00OGWB2UK,"""Cantinflas"" is the true story of Mexico's most famous comedy film star, known in this country mostly for the film ""Around the Word in 80 Days"" (1956), in which he starred as Passepartout, Phileas Fogg's right-hand man and the movie's comic relief. ""Cantinflas"" focuses on the period in his life when Broadway producer Mike Todd (Michael Imperioli) decides to make his Hollywood debut with a big-budget, all-star production of the Jules Verne novel.

Though he rose to fame in the 1940s and never starred in silent pictures, Cantinflas is often compared to Charlie Chaplin. Like Chaplin, he adopted ragged clothes, baggy pants, adding undersized hat, bandana, and two tiny bits of mustache, and played the wise-cracking peasant who gets the best of the bureaucracy and upper-class society types with his sharp, witty patter. He appeared in 55 films over a long career.

Oscar Jaenada does an impressive job channeling the real Cantinflas and director Sebastian Del Amo nicely establishes the era in which Cantinflas lived and worked. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles, and sometimes in English with Spanish subtitles.

There are no bonus extras on the DVD release.",1417046400,27,1176,5.146596858638744

As for the rest of what made up this movie, it did not sustain my interest. The build-up concerning the film Around the World in 80 Days was hard for me to appreciate. I never considered it an exceptional movie. All in all, there were too many moments when I found myself rather bored. Undoubtedly, for Mexicans, a big production such as this film about someone who amounts to a national icon triggers a different  set of standards for evaluation. 2 1/2 stars",1476316800,,569,4.69

The pace could have been just a little bit quicker, and unclear interventions of the portrayed ""Mike Todd"" around one of the many movies of the real Mario Moreno.

6750314,4,B00OGWB2UK,"The movie is not bad for Spanish speakers that know about this amazing character of the Latin American culture. I'm very impressed by scar Jaenada's job, even more with the fact that his not Mexican.

On the other hand, I have my doubts whether it is worth watching it for non-Spanish speakers as his comedy is highly tied to a verbal language style and it is almost impossible to keep his brightness in a translation. I know this is not a comedy movie, but it is important to understand Cantinflas style to really feel the transcendence of his biography.

I'm surprised, for example, that he won an Oscar for ""Around the World in 80 Days"" as his humor in English is not even half his humor in Spanish. It is almost like watching two different actor for me. In this sense it is quite sad his biography is somehow centered in that movie as his coronation. I understand the message to the world but for Mexicans and maybe for Latin Americans too that movie is definitely not a reference of Cantinflas' talent.",1459641600,,1007,4.527472527472527

6750411,5,B00OGWB2UK,"I after seeing the movie I was amazed when I heard many negative reviews of it. Then I understand that those reviews came from an audience mainly of non-Hispanic origin who has seen dozens of other similar biopics who didn't know or knew little about Cantinflas.
Me as part of the aimed audience of this movie (A Latin who grew-up enjoying Cantinflas' films weekly), I couldn't help but love it with all my heart. It is amazing how Oscar Janeda replicates Cantinflas in every aspect: from the dancing and bullfighting to speaking in Spanish and English with Mario Moreno's voice and accent.
The only thing that really takes me wildly out of the movie is that most of the other actors who play other celebrities of the time seem too static specially when compared with the main characters. In my opinion is that they wanted to show them as plastic, almost non-human, celebrities in contrast with more human Mario Moreno.

Taking that in consideration, it is a great homage to a great man and perfectly enjoyable for those who have seen (and understand) his work.",1444176000,6,1061,4.735135135135135

6750419,4,B00OGWB2UK,"I'm giving this a review based on FREE PRIME MOVIES on AMAZON PRIME.  I got to watch this for free with my Amazon Prime Membership.  I try to watch a lot of free movies and some of them are a waste of time, some of them don't make it past 10 minutes (despite the ""great"" reviews), some of them are MUST WATCH movies.  This is almost a MUST WATCH movie because it's very good -- especially if you're looking for a free movie to watch.

Although I had heard of the Mexican comedian who went by the name of Cantinflas, I didn't know anything about him.  I didn't know that Charlie Chaplin regarded him as the best comedian in the world.  I haven't even watched the ""Around the World in 80 Days"" movie.  Cantinflas probably saved that movie from being a box-office disaster.  I did do a lot of internet search while watching the movie and learned some good stuff about that era in film making both in the U.S. and in Mexico.

The movie is a period piece and so the costumes took you back to the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's.  That was nice.  The lighting in the movie is something you have to get use to and accept that this is the lighting that was used back in the 1950's.  The Spanish actor who plays the Mexican Cantinflas did an outstanding job.  Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos) did a good job in breaking out of his Sopranos role.  In this movie he portrays Mike Todd.  It took a little time to get use to the transition but it worked..

It is a very good movie.  It was entertaining, educational, enjoyable.",1444003200,,1505,4.317857142857143

6750422,5,B00OGWB2UK,"This film presents a convincing 'Cantinflas' and an insightful portrayal of Mario Moreno, who created the comic role. The film alternated between 1950s Hollywood California and over a half-century in the life and career of Mario Moreno. It is poignant, comic and consoling as we learn what drove Moreno in his acting career and in his relationships. The Hollywood portions are glossy and glitzy, but I was left wondering whether those portraying the American producers and agents are really Mexicans. Their English pronunciation is too perfect for Americans, but I could be totally wrong. The whole story seems to lead to Moreno's role in ""Around the World in 80 Days"", a film that American audiences would know. Those of us who are familiar with Cantinflas in many extraordinary Mexican films are glad to see the snatches of the comic routines that are typical of Moreno and which we never can see enough times.",1443744000,,912,4.967320261437909

6750446,4,B00OGWB2UK,"Entertaining, if somewhat rushed and disjointed.  Hard to cover such a long career, and too many irrelevant scenes or about irrelevant characters made it more difficult -- leaving no space for depth.  The movie has good moments, and it's polished, but often too much -- the buildings, the clothes, etc., look like just made for the ocassion, giving a feeling of plastic to many scenes.  The story itself feels sanitized -- as if written for a 1950s audience.  I still recommend it, as it tells much about the events in the life of this important and colorful entertainer in an amusing, if superficial, manner.  Just don't expect to learn much about the person he was.",1442188800,,667,4.765217391304348
6750447,4,B00OGWB2UK,"scar Jaenada did a remarkable job with most of Cantiflas' characteristics, given that he is Spanish and didn't grow up speaking Espaol Mexicano.

But again this movie wouldn't had released if it wasn't true or veridic, or at least approved by the Mario Moreno family. It is very good, it has very nice places of the Mexico City I remember, and that were the very center of the society back in his time. Not that I ever lived the same time, it's just that I know my history and the places in Mexico City. At least I can tell the beginnings were true because correspond exactly with what my parents told once about Cantinflas, and they went to the Carpas where Cantinflas was presenting his show, very poor places.",1441670400,,792,4.286666666666667

I was originally attracted to the promise of the backstory of the 1956 Universal Studios movie starring David Niven and Cantiflas Around the World in 80 days - which is one of my favorite all time movies. The movie was much more than I expected.

The movie catalogues the gritty determination,  ""Street Smarts"", political savvy and the personal tribulations associated with fame and fortune and the rise of Mario Fortino Alfonso Reyes as a superstar in the Mexican cinema whose career culminated in his Golden Globe award for best actor in Around the World in 80 Days as Cantiflas",1441411200,,626,4.942857142857143

6750532,5,B00OGWB2UK,"I'm glad this movie was made about Mexico's greatest comedian & entertainer. But one has to understand Mexican slang Spanish as spoken in Mexico City to fully understand & appreciate Cantinflas' gift of improvisational humor. The subtitles provided do not do justice to the movie for non Spanish speaking viewers. Oscar Jaenada did a brilliant job in his role of Cantinflas, but other actors fell short in their role of famous actors of the era. Overall, I recommend this movie but also recommend watching some of Cantinflas' original movies in Spanish first.",1439683200,,559,5.086956521739131

I pretty much felt a connection here with the film as features Mario Moreno's early days that gaved rise to is most famous comedy icon since Charlie Chaplin himself. The era of the 1930-40's ties in similar to my grandparents time and the families they came from. The person they knew as Cantinflas brought a positive change to their lives just like in the lives Mario inspired throughout Mexico. Those were the golden years as one might say even thought at the time the world was still struggling to recover from WW-1, and undergoing the economic crash of 1939, with the threat of WW2 looming over. The Actors performing their seniority parts are brilliantly  choreographed and wonderful performances. Canitinflas will always be portrayed a legendary figure in the Latin Cinema Culture.",1438992000,,861,4.937931034482759

6750683,1,B00OGWB2UK,"Cantinflas was a great character created by quite an unpleasant person. Anyone who ever knew Mario Moreno (I did) can attest to that. And that should have been the movie's argument. Instead we get a bland prefabricated rags-to-riches story with no interest whatsoever. At its very best, the film is a nostalgic recreation of Mexico's cinematic Golden Age, with many TV stars impersonating past movie icons (the scene with Michael Imperioli and an alleged Chaplin is so hokey it made me recoil in my seat!).

I'm not saying this had to be a Mexican version of ""The Private Lives of Peter Sellers"", but to merely show that Cantinflas was a poor Mexican boy who made it big and then to Hollywood doesn't quite grab anyone's attention. Better to show what really happened: a wonderful comic betrayed and killed by its embittered creator in order to be ""taken seriously"". In the end he was, for no one laughed with his last preachy pictures.

P.S.: ""Around the World in 80 Days"" was Cantinflas' only international hit -now horribly dated. His next attempt, ""Pepe"", was an abysmal flop. From then on, his career -Mexican or international- nosedived. Now, there's a storyline!",1431475200,10,1169,4.898989898989899

6750708,1,B00OGWB2UK,"I had the pleasure of spending various days in the company of Mario Moreno ""Cantinflas"" in 1965 when he visited the city where I was living at the time. My then girl friend was a personal friend of his. He was a charming gentleman - very erudite and serious when not in character!
Of course, this was a long time ago but in the meantime I have collected all his films on DVD which I enjoy watching from time to time - his death was a great loss for Mxico and the whole of the Spanish speaking world.
This film is not, in my opinion, a respectful tribute to the genius who was Mario Moreno ""Cantinflas"".",1425600000,,602,4.198275862068965
6750709,4,B00OGWB2UK,"When I heard of this film I had never heard of Cantinflas, and all I knew was that he was a Mexican comedian.  At first I thought perhaps it was his stand-up act.  Instead this is actually a complex biographical film, about not one but at least two people who rose from obscurity to fame, their fates intertwined.  One was Mario Moreno, who rose from small tent shows to become Mexicos most famous theatre comedian, and as the Mexican film industry began to take off, a major star in it as well.  He made films for the rest of his lifesome 55 in all.

During his rise to fame he fell in love with and married a blonde Russian girl who sadly, was unable to conceive the children they both wanted.  That, and the allurements of his fame very nearly destroyed their marriage, but in the end, it was nice to see, they reconciled and were very close until the end of her life (with him at her side).

The other was the Hollywood film producer, or WOULD-BE Producer, Mike Todd who had dreams of making a huge splash with his first major film, Around the World in 80 Days, based on the Jules Verne novel.  Todd had dreams of an all-star cast including people like Liz Taylor, all of whom ignored his advances.  He also spoke with Moreno/Cantinflas but at the time only offered him a bit part for which he had no interest.  At the last minute, before a scheduled press conference about this vaporware film with no actors, Cantinflas appears for a lunch with Todd and executives from United Artists and says hell do it---so long as he gets one of the leading roles: Passepartout, a right-hand man and comic character.  And thus the film came back to life, and Mario Moreno, a Mexican, lands a leading role in a Hollywood film back in the 1940ssomething unheard of then, and rare to this day.

The movie follows his acting career, his personal life, his involvement in the union movement, and illustrates how well-known he became (for example, a personal note from Charlie Chaplin calling him the worlds greatest comedian).

It is supposed to be sub-titled, and is, but the majority of the dialog is in Spanish with English subtitles.  At other points the dialog is in English with Spanish sub-titles, so it is truly a bilingual production.  It was a bit long overall at about 1 hr 50 minutes, but a quite interesting slice of history.  I give it a B.",1424736000,12,2341,4.485849056603773

6750718,1,B00OGWB2UK,"A waste of time. I have seen other works by Jaenada and I like him. He did a decent job portraying Mario Moreno but his Cantinflas comes out flat and  with no grace or real rhythm. In terms of some of the other characters I do not know anything about his wife but Shillinsky was very talented and he was the one who told Cantinflas to go ahead and move on. Even though Shillinsky did not have Cantinflas' success he had a career (here singing in Russian, he is the tall guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz1XpRlCLkg). Medel did work with Cantinflas,, in spite of their supposed rivalry, in theater and a movie  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A4_TbQup1g).

Another big problem is that they chose fluff over content. Maria Felix is exaggerated, same as el ""Indio""; neither Anna Lasyevska nor Otto Sirgo fill the screen as Miroslava and Andr&eacute;s Soler respectively. To top all of these problems you get two stories and both of them are unfinished as in both of them the dramatic arc is chopped and choppy.  Yes It would have been great to know more about Mario Moreno but Cantinflas' real gift was to be a Master of expression and language and  in a movie that attempts to attract the English speaking public his genius is lost. I am not suggesting not to make a movie in English just that an English speaking movie would need to concentrate in either Mario Moreno or Cantinflas and not make absurd adaptations like that of ""cantina fly""",1422057600,3,1445,4.78714859437751

8683527,4,B00OGWB2UK,"The story of Cantinflas cannot be told in two hours, but the producers did a pretty good job putting together a story about a man's amazing life. Loved the actor who played Mario Moreno. Hope to see him in future films. In this bio pic, you get to see the less amazing side, the ordinary side of someone that in spite of fame, could not have everything he wanted. Of course audiences always love to see a winner, but that's a fiction - usually. Life is never perfect, and therefore you cannot expect perfection in this film because it does a pretty good job of reflecting a man's amazing life. I gave it 5 stars because it was not geared for an English speaking audience - and there are some English speaking actors that could have been better dubbed over - or even given subtitles. I suppose I could have turned on closed captioning. Ah, well. Next time maybe my Spanish will be better. Good movie. It's worth the price of the popcorn.",1534118400,,936,4.416184971098266
