1013489,5,6305364354,"I thought all three episodes were really great.  They all possess the elements that make watching these volumes an absolute priority.  The videos bring out the 007 in West and the master of disguise in Gordon.  The  episodes are action packed and dig deep into the rare science fiction which  is amazingly and marvelously applied to the 1865 setting making ""The  Wild Wild West"" the best western ever.  That's just my opinion.  Watch  the episodes and see for yourselves.",929491200,10,471,4.860759493670886

7888230,5,6305364354,"i grew up watching reruns of this show and i still love it. the ""james bond"" of the west is every bit as cool as bond and has as many ""gagets"" . the three shows in this collection are the first 3 shows ever aired. they are actoin packed and great fun. "" the night the wizard shook the world"" the second tape in the set and the second one broadcast gave west his ""blofeld"" like bond in the short form of the great michael dunn as the small in body only dr.miguelito loveless. this was and in my mind still is the greastest villin to ever grace the t.v. screen. watch and see the fun mr. dunn,an over looked actor if there ever was one, has as he taunts west and proves that size is not the mesure of a man. why this is not on dvd in season by season packs is just beyond me. wake up hollywood and quit giving every show that came down the pike the season by season pack and put this great and exciteing show on dvd please we need this dose of great old t.v. now more than ever. i guess the wild, wild west movie, a piece of junk that should never been greenlighted must have made hollywood think we wouldn't by the series. well if you watch the orignal you will see what a great show it was and how bad the movie really trashes the concept.",1139616000,7,1239,4.020242914979757
7888231,4,6305364354,"It's way beyond time for all of these episodes to be in DVD. I'm amazed that this hasn't happened. With all of us that loved this show and watched it weekly, they would sell like hotcakes. Here's hoping that will happen very soon.",1139097600,4,230,4.372093023255814
7888232,5,6305364354,"I admit it has been some time since I've seen these shows, having worn the images right off my video tapes. When I was young I would have put James West up on my wall only they didn't publish him in the teen magazines. I confess, I couldn't really afford the magazines and may have missed him inside but if he'd been on the cover I would have found someone's kids to babysit to get the money I needed. I didn't miss an episode. So WHEN will the series be released on DVD? This one I would buy even over the Avengers and Ilya Kuriakin.",1109289600,10,534,4.095238095238095
7888233,5,6305364354,"Before TV executives at the major networks decided that compelling storytelling and engaging character development were just too difficult and too costly, and they put a camera around your dog's neck and hoped that you would enjoy watching Spot lick himself for a few hours every night, this show was a hit, and most deservedly so.  The stories were clever, the principal actors were excellent, the supporting players were memorable, and the action sequences were engaging and believable.  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin complemented each other perfectly.  Imagine James Bond and Q as a team of secret agents in the old west and you've got the picture.  Judging from Ebay and the numerous websites devoted to this TV series, its cult of followers continues to grow, both in numbers and loyalty.  Why an entrepreneur has not packaged the show on DVD by now, like almost every other show from the 60's, is an omission of epic stupidity.  There is a cult of thousands who have been waiting years.  Look how popular and profitable ""The Prisoner"" is, and you have some idea of the cult surrounding WWW.  I know people who will commute across the country just to tape reruns of the show.  Why?  Watch a few episodes and you will be hooked, too.  Believe this if you can.  Despite TV ratings that  today's so-called hit shows cannot achieve, WWW was cancelled by the network due to excessive violence.  Even as a teenager, I thought this decision was utterly dumb, and so will you.  This show was and is among the best entertainment TV has ever produced, and the fact that it was taken off the air by the network rather than its lack of an audience, and the fact that 40 years later, we are still praising its merits, proves that there must be a God.",1095120000,29,1742,4.647058823529412
7888234,5,6305364354,It would be great if the entire collection could come out on a DVD box set - there are quite a few people that would buy the set...,1023148800,10,131,3.7142857142857144
7888235,5,6305364354,"These episodes are very good! They reflect a mass of James West's tools and gadgets and the story lines are done very well! Well written. I'm a big James west fan and will tell you that among all episodes, these are very good and would go well in any Wild Wild West collection.",973900800,11,277,4.245283018867925
7888236,4,6305364354,"This is The Wild Wild West's second pilot, produced by Collier Young. This time, James West is a real lady's man (watch carefully the funny torture scene) instead of being a Spartan  just like in the original pilot. This is  not the best one but it is nevertheless amusing due to the fantastic  characters. It is a mean bandit-oriented episode with a peaceful and  educated Indian. The cast is remarkable, especially ""Forbidden  Planet"" Leslie Nielsen who plays a one-handed corrupted general.  Katherine Ross, the female lead, is quiet gorgeous too. ""The  Killing"" Elisha Cook, jr is nice, as traitor Mike McGreavy, and will  return in ""The Night of the Bars of Hell"". A new regular  character is introduced : the English manservant Tennyson who adds an  ironic touch to this very American drama. A word to the wise : watch this  one and please avoid the insignificant Wild Wild West movie.",940377600,7,891,4.8344370860927155
