8093249,2,B000BVN0ZU,"Mostly freaky, but not completely. Reminded me somewhat of the creepy scary part in Snow White when she's running through the forest. The cartoon was cute but had creepy and disturbing parts. The orphans, despite being somewhat adorable, were also extremely mushy & overly-cute, trying to cover for being hideously ugly, and sounding and acting weird. They also wore no pants with ratty undersized nightgowns that barely covered them properly.  Also seeing their ratty toys break (given by cruel, uncaring orphanage caregivers) might be very upsetting for kids to watch . . . or they might laugh instead. My children actually laughed at them when their toys broke Because they cried with helium screechy voices (that distracted from the story's intent to pull your heart strings and make you care). My kids also kept asking which orphans were girls or boys too and why they wore no pants (which I couldn't answer). I myself got the night creeps from seeing these freaky orphans as a kid, especially the black haired ones (wearing red undersized nightgowns) that included the bug-eyed, chubby one on the rocking horse and especially the one laying on his/her bed that suddenly screams ""SANTEE CLAUS!!!"" with an unnerving screech and charges crazily at the toy inventor. Made me ponder sleeping with a baseball bat for months because I almost thought those orphans were satanic freaks/zombies.  NOTE: I don't hate orphans in real life (real ones or these cartoon ones), but I wish the cartoonists made these in this cartoon more like the kids in the Fleischer cartoon ""Somewhere in Dreamland"".  Won't condemn those who like this cartoon, but this is my opinion.",1485907200,,1659,5.025454545454545
