1826047,3,B00008454R,"As a long-time fan, watching since the first season, recording all episodes, watching them at least 200 times, owning all the DVD's and VHS specials, etc., it sorta hurts me to write a bad review of this movie.  But, the fact is, it's just not very good. It's poorly written, with a premise that should have been a 5 minute skit, not a movie... and all of us long time Red Green fans know the show hasn't been the same since Rick Green left.  More's the pitty, then, when a real movie is made, sans Rick.  Actually, if you buy the DVD, the one hour 'behind the scenes' special included is better than the movie.
The basic plot of the movie is: guys need money, build duct tape goose, have trouble getting to duct tape contest... It's not much of a plot, even for an Ernest or Pee Wee Herman movie.  I've watched it 4 times now, hoping it'd grow on me... it hasn't.  There are no redeeming qualities here... nothing that couldn't have been done better as a regular episode.  Some long gone actors from the show make brief appearances... Reg, the vegetarian hunter, returns as a lawyer working, oddly enough, against the lodge.  Dwight manages a hotel.  I assume this is just Steve Smith giving friends some work, but it sorta ruins the whole thing for me when characters you know from the show are doing something completely different in the movie.
But the main thing missing from the movie is comedic timing... in the TV show, the timing is great... it's just not in the movie.  'Red Green' many times tells a joke, then seems to just stand there waiting for appause, and with no laugh track, it's sorta like... you know, it's like the Gilligan's Island movies, where they're rescued?  It's just not funny, and actually, a little sad because you can feel the actors working so hard to get a laugh.
One bright spot is Harold.  Patrick McKenna gives an on par performance as Harold in the movie.
Overall, though, it's slow, draggy, and not funny.  What would it have been with Rick Green directing?  We'll never know, but it would certainly have been better than this.",1052956800,2,2066,4.521505376344086
1826048,4,B00008454R,"Perhaps the easiest way to describe ""Duct Tape Forever"" is to say that it's better than ""Cabin Boy."" If you understand that, you don't need to read any further.
""DTF"" is the movie version of ""The Red Green Show,"" a CBC production shown only on PBS stations in the US (and on CBC, if your cable or satellite system carries it). It's hard to describe in a few words, other than to say it's about the ""inadequacy"" of the human male, while also conveying an implicit misogyny, in a Zoroastrian sort of way. Though ""Home Improvement"" starts from roughly the same base, ""Red Green"" is a great deal cleverer and wittier, and is devoid of the annoyance of being a ""family"" sitcom.
Steve Smith, the show's co-creator, is a writer possessed of dry, subversive wit. In the ""making of"" featurette (included on the DVD) he gives a guided tour of his private trailer and its cheap accoutrements. He explains that the TV's remote control is best used to turn off the TV, ""because you have no cable or no aerial or anything. I mean, it's like having TV in Baffin Island."" Pointing to the microwave oven, he informs us that ""This is mainly where I do my viewing. You get a bag of the Jiffy-Pop type popcorn -- especially with the foil on -- you put it in there and set it for around 20 minutes, and that's as good as any episode of `Matlock' you'll ever see."" In detailing the need for stunt doubles, he tells us ""When you kill someone in a movie and they're not a stunt person, you can get into some trouble for that.""
This is pretty funny on paper, but it's even funnier in the delivery, because Steve Smith gives it what can only be described as a schizophrenic or Cubist reading -- you hear the material simultaneously from two perspectives -- Steve Smith the writer, and Red Green the character. It's all very post(?)-post-modern, with the actor occupying two distinct psychological spaces at the same time (ie, ""inside"" and ""outside"" his character).
Despite being filmed on a budget that would barely cover the catering charges of a Hollywood blockbuster, ""DTF"" is a visually slick production. If you're expecting something as sloppily assembled as ""Strange Brew,"" you'll be pleasantly surprised. Steve Smith had the good sense to hire a talented director, cinematographer, and editor, and it shows.
""Strange Brew"" had Max von Sydow. ""DTF"" has Patrick McKenna, probably the only actor who can turn the need for orthodontic work into an artistic statement. He has a lot of screen time and several scenes that really show off his acting chops, which are considerable. He also gets the funniest line in the film.
""Red Green"" has never shied away from slapstick (slapstick and duct tape are natural partners), so the film has plenty of visual humor, even borrowing a classic gag from Buster Keaton. My only quibble is with the film's climax, where the slapstick gets out of hand, in a scene that must have had many viewers squirming and groaning.
One final, semi-personal comment... Steve Smith seems to have a Norma-Desmondish obsession with being middle-aged. I would simply suggest he stay away from wide-angle lenses, the nasally deleterious effects of which can be seen on the move's poster.
Warning to videophiles... The box is labeled ""anamorphic widescreen,"" but the transfer is conventional 4:3 letterbox. There are no obvious artifacts (eg, visible aliasing) so I'd suggest you Rush Right Out In A Buying Frenzy and grab this edition.",1052956800,4,3429,4.7841483979763915
1826049,5,B00008454R,"The PBS comedy Red Green makes a good movie!  A rich man visits Possum Lodge and finds a sinkhole with his fancy limo. The rich man, Robert Stiles, sues Possum Lodge for $10,000.  The only way to save the lodge, is that the giant goose made out of duct tape wins 3rd place in a duct tape contest.  Red Green (Steve Smith) takes along his nerdy nephew Harold and Dalton.  All through the movie, Red Green does the voiceover.  Any Red Green fan would love this movie!",1052265600,,465,4.2988505747126435
1826050,5,B00008454R,"I saw this movie in the Seattle area at a theater where Steve Smith (Red Green) was making a personal appearance. As he autographed my duct tape, I told him that the movie exceeded all my expectations. He said ""thanks for lowering them.""
I also promised him that I'd write a review on Amazon.com, and I've been waiting for this DVD to become available on Amazon.com in the US...
Anyway, this is a movie so don't expect it to have the ""look and feel"" of the series.  After all, it's not 90 minutes of short, mostly unrelated skits.  It has a slower pace, but most all of your favorite characters from the show are here, and there's a lot of that Red Green humor.
Some people gripe that this movie is a ""road trip"" and not a story shot at ""Possum Lodge"". Don't worry, it's not a very long road trip.
Finally, what really exceeded my expectations was some geniune character development for Red Green and Harold. You'll learn something about their past together, and why they are the way they are.
You'll also see some fantastic duct tape creations toward the end, but I won't spoil the whole ending for you.
If you've never seen the series, you probably should watch a few episodes of it before deciding on whether or not to buy this DVD.
However, if you're already a Red Green fan, I cannot see how you would regret buying this movie.  Considering the bonus features included, this should be a no-brainer.
So, put on a plaid flannel shirt, throw a log on the fire, grab some snacks (nothing too healthy), crank up the DVD player, lower your expectations, and laugh your head off.",1052179200,39,1577,4.487804878048781
1826051,5,B00008454R,"It's a well-documented fact that a television series cannot be turned into a movie, even though some bonehead exec will occasionally forget and make one.
Well, that must only be true in America because the cast and crew of the Red Green Show have made a really funny little movie.  While your average television conversion picture is obsessed with making everything bigger and better, the gang at Possum Lodge really know their strengths and play to them.  They are entering a Duct-Tape goose into a contest by the manufacturer in order to save the lodge from a developer who wants to destroy it for his mother.  Embodying the spirit of the Possum Lodge, they're shooting for third place.  With their massive symbol of the Canadian lifestyle, our guys are a shoe-in for third......but the evil developer has hired the sheriff and his deputy to stop Red and Harold from getting to the contest.  Wacky hijinks ensue (Really, this is not sarcasm.  It's freakin' hilarious hijinks).
The DVD has a small but well-picked selection of special features that will be entertaining to any fan of the show (Which you probably will be after this movie).  The actors' stories and opinions are actually interesting, as opposed to some others I could mention.  And they don't display the cultivated obsequiousness which marks so many actors from our country.

1826102,3,B00008454R,"I watched the ""Red Green Show"" for years on PBS. Red Green I suppose is Canada's response to Tim Allen (or vice versa as the case may be), a male-oriented show demonstrating all the foibles and fallacies of men and their hobbies. At some point, somebody with money must have said, ""Let's make a Red Green movie!"" and this was the result.

The plot is pretty straightforward on the surface as the Possum Lodge is being threatened by some Evil Rich Guy whose limo was accidentally destroyed while apparently visiting the property. The court gives Red and his crew 10 days to come up with $10,000 to pay the fine or else. So naturally, the Possum Lodge gang proceeds to build a rather nice looking goose out of duct tape to enter the annual Duct Tape competition in Minnesota since third prize happens to be $10,000. However, the Evil Rich Guy has plans for taking over the property and does everything possible to stop Red from succeeding.

On the positive side, Red Green (Steve Smith) is a natural in front of the camera and behind it as well since he narrates the story. He manages to pull out some laughs and keep things rolling. However, the real star is Patrick McKenna who really imbues Harold with more thought, energy and depth than ever seen before. Although his relationship with Deputy Dawn (Melissa DiMarco) is way underdeveloped and makes little sense at all, this is arguably the best Harold story ever.

Other great touches include the main henchman of the Evil Rich Guy who is constantly eating, a visit with Ranger Gord (Peter Keleghan) who is just too darn excited about seeing ANYONE, and the all-too-brief appearance of everyone's favorite dynamite expert Edgar K. B. Montrose (Graham Greene) whose reactions are just perfect in the two minutes he's on-screen.

Unfortunately, the story is so ill-conceived and poorly executed that it works against the flow of the plot which undermines a lot of humorous possibilities. The Evil Rich Guy story is older than dirt and frankly just doesn't work (in Canada, rich people apparently can own a town Sheriff). Red's visit to the Records Office just makes no sense at all since they owe the court the $10,000 meaning he shouldn't be stopping along the way and wasting time. The climatic ending where the duct tape goose manages to reach the competition (like you didn't think that was going to happen) is not really funny and works on a level of humor far different than the rest of the film...not to mention different physics. Plus, what's the conversion rate of US dollars to Canadian dollars?...Yea, the movie didn't take that into account either.

Given the numerous characters that fill Possum Lodge, a ""scavenger-hunt"" type storyline involving all of them would have been far stronger or at least more entertaining than this mess which was seemingly cooked up by people having little to do with the show...or at least that is what it seems. Instead, we get what appears to be a quickly written up script for a movie that is not very well photographed or edited for that matter. Almost all of Possum Lodge's most beloved characters, save for Red, Harold and arguably Dalton Humphrey (Bob Bainborough) are barely seen which is really disappointing.

Having said all that, I do enjoy seeing Red Green and his nephew Harold to the point of giving this film essentially a pass at three stars. If you like ""The New Red Green Show"", then you will probably at least tolerate this movie. If you have never seen the show, then by all means do NOT watch this movie until you have seen several episodes which are far, far superior than what's in this film.",1394323200,2,3611,4.74203821656051

However, I found myself just not that impressed by the film. I think I figured out why... in the movie the writers came up with some external ""enemy"" (the sheriff and the rich guy) that the men of Possum Lodge must defeat. However, what made the show hilarious was that the men of Possum Lodge were inevitably their OWN worst enemy, with predictable consequences. The film had all the characters but not all the elements which really made the show so great.",1200614400,,586,4.485981308411215
1826147,5,B00008454R,"I was never one to sit on the couch and watch hours of television without end, but there was one show that a friend of mine convinced me to watch and soon enough I was hooked! The jokes about marriage, being a man, and duct-tape sweeten my day nomatter how damn bad it is! I thought to myself. These guys are just terrific. They MUST have a movie out! And sure enough, there is! I ordered it from Amazon.com to see what's up, and there is no disappointment!

Overall, the movie is a nice break from the usual Red Green Show. Typical episodes follow a distinct story line of a play set up, possume lodge word game, Gord's educational cartoons, the expert's portion of the show, a word of advice about life from Mr. Green, and an action clip of them participating in a task or playing a sport. But in the movie there's a well thought-of plot and a constantly changing setting.

Well, here's the story-board. If you want to purchase the movie and not know exactly how the whole thing turns out, then I suggest you skip this paragraph. A business man named Stiles has a lemo that hit a sink-hole in Pussume Lodge. The police come and start a court case for damaged property. Herold is smitten with the female cop, Mandy. In the courtcase, they are ordered at first 30 days to pay for the damages or the lodge turns into property of the county. Herold decides to be a bonehead and come to the judge and say its close to impossible to make that much money in 30 days. So she makes it 10 days. That way it is impossible! After the lodge members let Herold have it, he suggests that they enter a duct tape contest in Minnesota in which if they win at least 3rd place, then they'll win 10,00 dollars, just enough money to pay for the damages. But they have created something out of duct-tape that may make them win. This giant duct-tape goose is to follow the pussume van on their way to the contest! But the police men and Stiles doesn't want them to make it to the contest. In one incident they have to stop for gas and something to eat, and the police car stops next to them. Mandy and the officer deflate their tires on the possume van. Then they pirate the police vehicle, get gas, then put it in their tank. They drive off, leaving ten dollars for gas. In one more incident, the police men take a 208 cat crane. But they trapped themselves next to a small canyon. So they lift their own police car and drop it in the crane, then Red and Herold drive over it! My brother seems to complain that it's fake, but it's his fault that he can't shut his mouth and just enjoy a movie. A few chapters later, the officer is fired. Then Stiles finds the pussume van and gets them to collide into a haystack. Herold rushes out to appologize, but Stiles abducts him. RedGreen sees Ranger Gord, who is happy to hear someone say his name, then tells the plants to keep quiet while Red uses his payphone. He calls Stiles and they make an agreement. If Red Green gives Stiles the goose, then he'll give him his nephew back. Red Green says he'll think it over. So he calls back to the lodge members to come to a special spot in a bus while Stiles calls his own crew of men coming in nice, expensive cars. Once they get there Herold hesitates because he feels guilty that they're losing the lodge because of him. One shot of a gun is all it takes for him to coward over to Red Green! His men board on Stile's army's vehicles, then the chain attached to the goose smacks Stiles in the nuts, then they drive off. This makes him real mad. So he gets back in his lemo, and chases Red and Herold once again. This time, they've got guns shooting at their tires. Luckily, Herold recalls a plan from a James Bond movie. By pouring gasoline from behind the duct-tape goose, they can reflect the gun shots and cause a huge path of fire that can steer the lemo off. This is what Red Green meant when he says all his contenuous sarcastic remarks on Herold were to help him become a man. So he throws the gasoline out from the back, and the duct-tape goose actually starts to fly! Again, my brother made a smart remark on how unrelistic that is, but once again it's his fault. The contest was close by and people didn't know what to think when a gigantic duct-tape goose came flying and sat right on a duct-tape stand, and a doofus man came flying out from the back. Sure enough, they win 3rd prize. Herold got the respect that he never before had. And even better, Mandy stared at Herold with moon eyes and signaled him to come to her. About the time Edger makes a cake for celebration but accidentally used dynomite sticks instead of candles, Herold and Mandy had a deep kiss outside the lodge while it exploded into nothing more than ragged peices of wood and duct-tape. Red Green orders the lodge to be fixed, saying ""Get the duct-tape.""

The movie is so damn entertaining! Sense I got it, I've been watching it every now and then and it never gets old! It's really too bad that the series of the Red Green Show had to be disconteuned back in 2006, but can anyone tell me if there's anything like a sequel for the halarious peice of Canadian comedy? Because whatever it is, I'm welling to order it!

So, like you, being a fan of the show, I thought this was probably marginal and somewhat predictable, but I figured I'd show my appreciation and put a nickel in his pocket.

Some of the writing was clever, but the story just didn't reach the high standards set by years of the show. The magnetism between Deputy Dawn and Harold should have been developed better, and why bother with the flashback sequence? I would have loved to see them make more of regular minor characters like Winston Rothschild III instead of wasting time on less-developed characters like the Sheriff. Red could have challenged the Rich City Guy to a winner-take-all word challenge, or set up an ""out-innovate your opponent"" contest. The duct-tape sculpture contest device was a bit weak. Maybe there's just a point you reach where it's just too late to make a movie spin-off of a project. I'd actually rate the DVD extras as much more valuable than the movie itself. They give a lot of insight into the show, the creative forces behind it, and the amazingly talented guys who make up the cast. I'm just disappointed that the movie had great material to work with and didn't live up to its potential. Buy it for the extras, not the movie.",1157328000,6,1197,4.650943396226415

Steve Smith and crew deserve some kind of an award for their efforts. The movie is something the whole family can enjoy. Very smart motion picture alot of zany gags from all the gang.

Those who are use to the show's format will have to adjust in order to appreciate the movie. I know with me the first time I viewed it I was not thrilled.  But a subsequnt viewing made me enjoy it a lot more.  I think Red Green is kinda like that.  When you first view it you kind of dismiss it, but something draws you back none the less, and then it gradually grows on you like a fungus!  Give this movie a chance to do the same thing.  True, its a little silly and sentimantal, perhaps more so than the Show for sure, but that's the why movies are these days.  Red and his characters actually have to sustain some longer scenes, and the production value is deffinitely better than what we are accustomed to on the show.  Harold seems to be the main character who gets to evolve, just a little bit, and he gets his first kiss with the female cop which was a bit hooky, but thats the movies!  I wonder if they have sheriffs in Canada? Thought it might be Constables more on the English model.  Was not sure on that point, but one really should not ask these kinds of questions with Red Green!  An added feature are the behind the scenes notes on the making of the movie where many amusing interviews of the charaters are shown.  This could be a real plus for the viewer even more than the movie perhaps.  Overall, Red Green fans should enjoy it. This is the kind of film with a built in audience. I would recommend first time viewers to see some of the shows before checking out the movie. That way they can understand the strange way that Red Green works.

However, in this instance Possum Lodge members make the leap onto the ""silver screen"" with an extended rendition of the wit and wisdom of Possum Lodge intact. (All 80 blank pages).  Well, Ok. maybe it needed a little duct tape to hold the plot together, but didn't we all wish for a road adventure that would show how lodge members stick together to solve a problem?
I mean if we can't all come together for third place, what do we aspire to?
To appreciate this movie it helps to have grown up in Northern Michigan with my Dad and his friend assembling a log splitter in their garages with various spare parts instead of taking the short cuts and buying some fancified-whimpy-under-powered piece of junk from some store.  Red and Harold bring to life a place I grew up in, including all of the things that keep life entertaining.
May Red and his group keep their stick on the ice and only change if they have to.
They may not be handsome, but they are entertaining!

I have a few suggestions, RENT THIS MOVIE FIRST, THEN BUY IT IF YOU LIKE IT(I saw it on TV, thank god)!
