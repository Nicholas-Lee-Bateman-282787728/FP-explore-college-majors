2066210,5,B000286RR0,"Director Martin Scorsese pops up in so many different places - speed-rapping in every third documentary about film history, supplying voices for cartoons, sending up his auteur image in a recent television commercial - that it's sometimes easy to forget he's one of the top five directors still working in movies.

 But a batch of his best films has finally been issued on DVD, three of them for the first time, and they're a good example of how great his past and later work really is.  The big coup here is that Scorsese offers commentaries for some of his best movies but there's a slight catch: the commentaries are presented scene specifically (meaning he only comments on certain scenes and the player automatically skips from one to the next; also, Scorsese tends to talk more about the movies as a whole, rather than what we're actually seeing onscreen, which is fine but most people who've read anything at all about the guy already know a lot of what he's saying and would probably prefer nuts-and-bolts discussion; I know I would).  The movies, however, are classic regardless.

 The big kahuna of the bunch, ""Goodfellas,"" is arguably Scorsese's masterpiece and a film that encapsulates everything he does well as a director. It's rough stuff, lurid and violent and told with equal measures of dreamy nostalgia and nightmarish detail. Even 15 years after its release, it's definitely not for everybody, but it's a great American movie anyway, filled with so many vivid details, great performances and excellent tunes that it actually improves on a second and third viewing.

 ""Goodfellas"" was issued on DVD before but only as a hastily thrown-together ""flipper"" disc that split the film into two parts. Now it's been done right, with the entire movie on one side, two commentaries, some decent documentaries and great remastered stereo - I'm not an audiophile by any means so if something sounds particularly good as it flows out of my ailing old stereo system, then it must be pretty amped up.

 ""Mean Streets"" and ""Who's That Knocking at My Door?"" almost seem like early drafts of ""Goodfellas."" They, too, are about low-level crooks whose lives consist mostly of hanging out and shooting the breeze - like ""Diner"" or Fellini's ""I Vitelloni,"" except with occasional bursts of brutality and larceny.

 ""Who's That Knocking"" was made on the serious cheap when Scorsese was a student at New York University in the late '60s (it's actually three different shorts, involving the same characters, woven into one story). It gave Harvey Keitel his first screen role as a kid trying to romance a troubled girl (Zina Bethune) from outside of his Little Italy neighborhood, and it's good but not great; it's slow and a little knuckleheaded but shows Scorsese's early potential; watching it is almost like listening to early Beatles recordings, hearing the familiar voices but knowing how much better the band was going to get.

 Within that comparison, ""Mean Streets"" (1973) is the director's ""Rubber Soul"" - not quite the complex ""Abbey Road"" of ""Goodfellas,"" but still a heartfelt classic. Even though the setting and story are similar, it's a big leap forward for Scorsese who, in five years, had drastically improved his use of the camera and actors. Again, Keitel plays another not-half-bad gangster who, this time, copes with Catholic guilt and peer pressure and tries to protect his chronically irresponsible cousin (an amazingly youthful and hyperactive DeNiro) from a loan shark. It's loose and weird and driven by the characters instead of the story, but it's also infectious, frequently brilliant and, though underseen, it spawned dozens of imitations.

 ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" stars Ellen Burstyn as a housewife who, after the death of her husband, winds up working in a Phoenix greasy spoon called Mel's Diner. Sound familiar? Yes, it became the basis for the TV show ""Alice,"" but it's much less lighthearted than the sitcom it spawned. Scorsese was, to a degree, trying to do something different (namely: direct a hit movie) and while his heart doesn't completely seem in it, it's a solid drama with a strange, intense flair to it.

 ""After Hours"" is a dark comedy set in SoHo in the early '80s, starring Griffin Dunne as Paul, a shy word processor who gets roped into the Date From Hell and then spends the rest of the movie trying and failing to get back home. Everything gets in his way: a subway fare increase, a pair of burglars, evil evil women and general dumb luck. It's a twisted satire about half-truths that spiral into disastrous lies, and the movie's grimace-inducing episodes are almost its undoing: It's so successful in painting Paul into a corner that it's almost too frustrating to watch. But for those who appreciate their comedy black with no sugar, it's a wry cult favorite and, according to a documentary on the disc, it almost became Tim Burton's first film. Burton heard Scorsese was interested, backed out and went on to debut with another twisted classic: ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure.""",1093478400,53,5034,4.9655172413793105

  That aside, I LOVE these films, and always have. But, I must admit that I was disappointed (sort of) with the bonus stuff. No new Scorsese or De Niro interviews, and NO Harvey Keitel interviews at all.

and yet another question: is Goodfellas not a 2-DVD set? then why does it say 5-DVD box??",1093219200,,251,4.5777777777777775
2066213,4,B000286RR0,"The greatest living director of our generation, Martin Scorsese, finally gets a much overdue tribute, thanks to Warner Home Video. ""The Martin Scorsese Collection"" features five outstanding examples of a master director indulging in his craft; Who's That Knocking At My Door (1968), Mean Streets (1973), Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), After Hours (1985) and Goodfellas (1990). Scorsese, who became a producer, writer, actor and finally director, grew up in New York's Little Italy - the inspiration for his best films. Many of his masterworks have long been available on DVD, including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Waltz, The Last Temptation Of Christ, The Age Of Innocence, Casino and Gangs Of New York.

There is so much to talk about that we might as well get started. ""Who's That Knocking At My Door"" is the story of J.R. (Harvey Keitel), a young man of no ambition who, quite by accident, finds himself sitting next to `the girl' (Zina Bethune) on the Staten Island ferry. The girl is impressed by J.R's knowledge of classic movies and the pair quickly become lovers in a problematic relationship that is, sadly, doomed nearly from the start. This is the only B&W film in this box set. Contrast levels appear a bit weak with whites slightly on the gray side. Image detail is also unstable, some scenes appearing quite detailed and others just so-so to extremely blurry. These shortcomings appear to be inherent in the original film negative and are not a flaw of DVD mastering. Film grain is present but hey, it's a Scorsese film: he generally likes a gritty image and this film is certainly a fine example of that.

 ""Mean Streets"" is the first teaming of Scorsese and DeNiro on film. Harvey Keitel is Charlie, a thug who collects debts and runs a numbers game. One of his friends, Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) owes money to Michael Longo (Richard Romanus). But Johnny is a loose canon and, as the plot progresses, we learn just how unstable a person he can be. Tensions mount after Charlie becomes enamored with an epileptic, Teresa (Amy Robinson). By no means a watershed production, in hindsight ""Mean Streets"" heralds the coming of ""Goodfellas."" This is a very dark film - literally.  But Warner's DVD mastering is bang on with colors that are vibrant. Flesh tones are very accurately rendered. Black and contrast levels reveal a significant amount of fine detail. Overall the image is very sharp. There is a slight amount of film grain and some light shimmering present. No edge enhancement though, for an image that is basically smooth.

Next up is Scorsese's first important masterwork, ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."" Departing from his formulaic atmosphere of dark brooding unscrupulous characters, ""Alice..."" tells the story of Alice Hyatt (Ellen Burstyn) an abused housewife on the verge of a nervous breakdown when her husband, Donald (Billy Green Bush) is suddenly killed in a truck accident.  Determined to exploit the tragedy as her new lease on life, Alice packs up her station wagon with son, Tommy (Alfred Lutter) in tow.  Alice's dreams of becoming a singer are short lived but a second chance at romance might be in the stars when Alice lands a job as a waitress at Mel & Ruby's Caf&eacute; where a frequent customer, David (Kris Kristofferson) recognizes Alice's innate value as a soul mate. Burstyn's tour de force performance won her the 1974 Academy Award as Best Actress and the film spawned the long running, highly successful television series, ""Alice.""  Warner's DVD certainly delivers with vibrant colors. Black levels are very deep and whites are always clean. Contrast and fine details are nicely realized with only a hint of film grain. During the opening shots there is some very distracting artifacting going on but this vanishes after the opening credits for a picture that will surely NOT disappoint.

""After Hours"" is the out of control spiraling saga of mild mannered Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne), whose chance meeting with the seemingly harmless, Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) leads to an increasingly perilous adventure. Marcy is full of interesting stories and this is precisely why Paul is initially attracted to her. However, Marcy's behavior becomes increasingly unstable and Paul bolts. Feeling like a jerk, which of course he is, Paul decides to return for an apology but discovers Marcy dead in her bedroom. Unfortunately for Paul, he soon finds himself the focus of a troupe of vigilantes who believe he's responsible for a string of burglaries. Eventually, Paul's artist friend offers him a means of escape by turning him into a Paper Mache figure - go figure?!? Although much maligned by critics upon its initial release, ""After Hours"" has since developed a cult following that has spilled into the mainstream. Critics and poor box office aside, the film is a tour de force of set pieces with an eerie, unsettling quality and some very grim, black humor that is outstanding. Warner's DVD delivers a very nice looking vintage 80s image. Colors are vibrant and flesh tones are accurately rendered. Black levels are deep and white are very clean. Film grain and a hint of dirt are present but do not distract. There are no digital anomalies for a very smooth picture that will not disappoint.

Now, for the icing on the cake; ""Goodfellas,"" #94 on AFI's list of 100 greatest movies of all time and widely regarded as the best mob movie ever made by critics and audiences alike. Written by Nicholas Pileggi and based on his book ""Wiseguy"", ""Goodfellas"" charts the meteoric rise and catastrophic crash and burn of tough guy, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Hill was a small time thug whose involvement with the mafia paved the way for the most daring narcotics ring ever established in the U.S. Hill's teaming with the very dapper, very savvy, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and the very foul-mouthed Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) is at once fortuitous and frustrating as Hill watches Conway and De Vito rise to great heights within organized crime while he remains the front runner of lowly accord. The trio's mob boss, Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) befriends Hill but the association is short lived after their latest heist goes horribly awry. Brutally violent and viscerally disarming, the first time viewing experience of ""Goodfellas"" is very much like riding a psychotic horse through a burning barn - particularly in the latter half when Hill's own drug addiction leads to a manic and paranoid existence.  As for the quality of this newly minted DVD, there is a marginal improvement between this disc and the original flipper from Warner.  Flesh tones are overall accurate but there continues to be a reddish tint in certain scenes. A murky haze continues to be present during the early scenes.  Digital anomalies are completely absent for an overall smooth look that is appealing. Fine details, black levels and contrast levels are bang on. The image quality will surely NOT disappoint.

Apart from the ""Goodfellas"" disc, all other soundtrack elements have been preserved in mono. There's really nothing to talk about in terms of fidelity for the mono films. They are presented at an adequate listening level and with an absence of hiss or popping that is usually characteristic of films of this vintage. ""Who's That Knocking At My Door"" is perhaps the weakest audio of the bunch, exhibiting a muffled characteristic. However, considering the shoe string budget for the film this is to be expected. ""Goodfellas"" is a very finely wrought 5.1 presentation. Dialogue is perhaps a bit more front sounding than one would expect - though no less bold and ironically crystal clear. The effects and music tracks really pack a wallop.

Extras include commentary tracks for all the films. ""Goodfellas"" has two, plus a host of featurettes and a thorough documentary on the making of the film. For the rest, there are shorts and featurettes that are nice complimentary extras. One would have appreciated a definitive documentary on Scorsese as a film maker but perhaps this was asking too much for a box set that retails well under a hundred dollars. Overall, this is a great edition to any home theater aficionado's library and it comes highly recommended.",1093046400,18,8201,4.967201166180758
2066214,4,B000286RR0,"It's good to finally see the underrated films ""After Hours"" and ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" on DVD.  It's also nice to see upgraded versions of ""Mean Streets"" and that most magical of Scorsese's flicks, ""GoodFellas.""  We are also given exposure to his little-seen debut ""Who's That Knocking At My Door,"" which is marginal at best, but very risque for a 1968 release.  The film also highlights many of the central concerns of later Scorsese films: guilt, maturation, marginalization.

While it's hard to argue with the movies, the presentation of these films in the DVD format is less than desired.  The commentaries are shown on an alternate track--therefore, you end up missing 1/3 of the film.  The commentary on ""GoodFellas"" has so many voices that it can get confusing from time to time.  There are also very few scene-by-scene commentaries, as much of the comments focus on the backstory of how the films got produced, greenlighted, etc.  This is a little frustrating.  The bonus documentaries are interesting, but not always enlightening.  ""GoodFellas"" and ""After Hours"" have the best documentaries, while the remaining docs aren't very informative.  Once again, this set is definitely worth it, but for those expecting some serious bells and whistles, this is bound to disappoint.  And as one other reviewer noted, there are no booklets (at least there weren't in my set).",1092873600,10,1385,5.1066666666666665
2066215,4,B000286RR0,"Like the idea of a box set, and am happy Scorsese is releasing Goodfellas with commentary - but we need a new edition of Taxi Driver with commentary. Also, despite what others have said, Casino has grown on me over the years and is certainly no clone of Goodfellas. The film is worth revisiting. I have a VHS version, so I don't know if the current DVD of Casino contains commentary, but if not, it should be reissued with one. Scorsese, as everyone knows, is a terrific scholar of film history, so I'm sure he understands the importance of leaving behind as full an account of his own work as he can. His future fans will be as grateful as his current ones.",1092700800,,658,4.357723577235772
2066216,5,B000286RR0,"Well, this is obviously not a complete collection of Scorsese. But still, the price is right, 5 films, 6 discs, and such a cheap price. Plus, it includes the LONG TIME waited GOODFELLAS Special Two Disc Edition, my second Scorsese favorite. Plus, Mean Streets Special Edition, and the rest, all great, magnificent films, After Hours, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and Who's that Knocking?. A great Deal.
However, it is regretable that it is missing someother films from Scorsese, now I don't mind it not having Casino, Taxi Driver, Age of Innocense and Gangs of New York, since I already own them. But what about Cape Fear, Kundun, Bringing Out the Dead, The King of Comedy, The Last Temptation of Christ, and my biggest regret, Raging Bull.
Now, the GoodFellas Special Edition is encouraging, that maybe, we will see the same treatment given to my favorite movie of all time, Raging Bull, that by the way, it is out of print.
However, this Collection is perfect, because it offers great Scorsese, at a very good price, let's hope each box comes with a hard plastic box, instead of the typical Warner Slip Case, and that specially GoodFellas has a great DVD.
By the way, Amazon lists it as a 5 disc Collection, it is actually 6 discs, GoodFellas, as I understand is the Special Two Disc Edition. I hope right.",1088640000,,1311,4.7043478260869565
2066217,5,B000286RR0,"I've been waiting a while for this. Being an adamant fan of Martin Scorsese's work, I've surprisingly never seen most of the films included in this collection. In fact, I've only seen GOODFELLAS (one of my all-time favorite motion pictures).
The rest of the films included here have been ""must-sees"" on my list for some time but I could never find them on DVD! The MEAN STREET DVDs went out of print and reportedly some of the others as well. Luckily, they're now all here, in one collection, perfect for the die-hard Scorsese fans out there!
I already own the ""flipper"" snap case version of GOODFELLAS with the poor transfer and sound quality, so I can't wait for the Special Edition. Here's a full list of the DVDs and special features:
DVD Features: Contains Five Martin Scorsese Films all with director commentary:
After Hours
Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore
Goodfellas: Two-Disc Special Edition
Mean Streets: Special Edition
Who's That Knocking At My Door?
Widescreen anamorphic format
Number of discs: 5
This looks to be an extraordinary gift set, perfect for fans of Scorsese. There is, however, one slight downside: This collection doesn't feature the out-of-print RAGING BULL. It also doesn't feature some of Scorsese's other great films such as THE KING OF COMEDY, CASINO, etc. Surely a ten-set DVD at double the price would have been acceptable - after all, this set IS for the real Martin Scorsese fans out there, and I'm sure they wouldn't mind paying $70 - $80 for some of the greatest films ever made!
Or at least they should have just included RAGING BULL...It's available on Special Edition Region 2 but not Region 1. I'm very disappointed because the film is a classic and it's a shame the DVD hasn't been re-released yet.

Mean Streets alone is worth the price but it also contains epic gangster-lifestyle Goodfellas with all the extras and a sleeper pic (popular then but usually forgotten now) After Hours about a lost and loony night in lower Manhattan.

Alice is a period road movie about a divorcee' played by Ellen Burstyn (who won the Oscar for it) and her wise acre son trying to make ends meet while traveling through the Southwest. It holds up well stylistically with great performances by the 2 leads, the mom and the kid.

Lastly a student film of Scorcese's that later became a feature, Who's That Knocking. It's an interesting artifact of early Scorsese style, (served as a template for Mean Streets) but a rather dull narrative. Best seen with his commentary playing on top of it.

2066305,3,B000286RR0,"Who's That Knocking at My Door ( 1969 )  attracts viewers
from the 2 punch combination, of being a Martin Scorcese
picture and of headlining Harvey Keitel.

This film demonstrated and set the standard for world-class
work that both individuals would continue accomplishing
time and again, onwards.

In this particular movie, there's various components, the
main one being an attempt to bridge the gap between making
a professional movie, and what is interesting for the
average man in the street, early to mid 20's, who finished
school or college, but who at present isn't following the
set pattern of the 9 to 5 company man routine.

As such, a large part of the 90 mins shows Keitel and Zina
Bethune establishing a rapport, building a relationship,
gaining intimacy, and finally, addressing spiritual core
issues of morality in terms of how much their relationship
should or would need to evolve and grow, legitimately.

In reality, Keitel and 2 pals all struggle to find meaning
in their lives, (although they may not realize it) not
having a set objective overall of what they want to do with
it, preferring instead to perpetuate an adolescent
(frat-house) lifestyle, of driving in a car, hosting
parties with hired women as entertainment, drinking,
gambling and playing cards, when not managing a snack bar
one of them is managing.

At the same time, Keitel's character is perplexed in
reconciling his libido (which he amply satisfies with a
number of hired women in his flat, throwing cash at them),
with his upper-class, mature Italian family upbringing or
with  traditions also inculcated from early on. He
makes a distinction between the fun he has with those fast
women, as compared with the serious relationship he desired
with a girlfriend he's planning on spending his life with,
originally drawing an impervious line between the two.

The filming is wide-screen, black and white, with crystal
clear  images;  the only bizarre moments being the lack of
audio in some  scenes showing people talking, or the out of
place audio as compared to what is visually shown, or
simply random noises in the background.

A number of popular mainstream American numbers are
selected, such as ""The Closer You Are"" doo-wop, and others,
allowing youth to (again) better relate to the action as
compared to  movies from earlier generations.

Keitel's talent is clear, as he visually expresses with
subtlety, feelings that are simmering below the surface,
bringing a natural presence, or personality, to the
picture, more real to viewers.

The director decided to film all  the actors wearing a
sports suit and tie, as a kind of standard uniform, for
stylish reasons.

The technology of the era is somewhat demonstrated, with
multiple floor automobile parking, air conditioning and
electric windows in vehicles, etc.

This suggests the protagonist is set in his ways, and can't
reform or correct his character, and suggests also perhaps,
that's what every American is going through in this day and
age (late 1960's.)

The work is time well spent, as the editing is spotless,
and Zina Bethune's soft-spoken, candid, realistic acting is
a match for Harvey Keitel.",1243641600,,3155,5.067698259187621

2066327,5,B000286RR0,"This is the best deal going on Amazon right now.  If I didn't already have these movies on DVD, I'd be all over this.  Scorsese is far and away my favorite filmmaker.  He's proven time and time again that he can find the true soul in any story and find the heart in any character.  His films are all classics.  However, I'm a little baffled by the inclusion of After Hours in this set.  It's a good movie, but not one that I would call essential.  It does demonstrate Scorsese's range, though.  I suppose that might have been the point, but this box set would have been perfect if had included Taxi Driver and Raging Bull instead.

I am very glad that Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore was included.  It is very underrated, and barely ever seen.  It is easily one of Scorsese's best films, and Ellen Burstyn gives one of the best performances in the history of cinema.

After Hours is an entertaining black comedy with Griffin Dunne trapped in a yuppies nightmare worthy of 4 stars.

Whos that knockin' is effectively a dry run for Mean Streets. However, Scorcese was still learning his craft in the 60's and whilst there are cinematic references to many classic films you do feel that Scorcese hadn't quite found his own voice at this stage of his career.

Goodfellas is a magnificent film. Only the first two Godfather films are on the same level in modern gangster films. This film has pace. It moves from one classic scene to the next. I remember Scorcese in an interview saying ""you want it fast let's make it really fast"" - this was his reaction to the 80's trend in fast cutting etc, but he does it with class.

The three lead roles are all marvellously played, and for me if I had to pick one, Joe Pesci would just steal the acting honours. This is a 5 star film.

The box is just cardboard with four DVD's in it. Goodfellas is the special edition which is much superior to the early double sided edition.",1174089600,,1215,4.454954954954955
2066329,5,B000286RR0,"An excellent collection, starting at Scorsese's debut feature taking you all the way to his masterpiece goodfellas.

  Who's that knocking at my door - Scorsese's film debut out of NYU funded by NYU and Scorsese's agreement to use the doors song the end over a sexy fantasy scene. The film is about falling in love, how the little moments in the beginning of a relationship are so wonderful. The fantasy scene is still groundbreaking today, great on showing how men desire sexual women but fear whores. A must see for any fan of scorsese or anyone who enjoys realistic filmmaking.

  Mean Streets - Today, it remains of Scorsese's best and one of the best of the 70s. Mean streets is about a small time hood named Charlie who constantly has sinning on his conscience while attempting to help his crazy friend Johnny boy played by De Niro which led to the role of Don Corleone and an oscar! Wonderful film, beautiful cinematography, and beautiful, personal filmmaking! One of the best I've seen.

  Alice doesn't live here anymore - You might think Scorsese sold out working with a major studio and a star but all the elements from his previous films are there. Ellen Burnst won an Oscar for her amazing portrayal of Alice, a widow trying to raise her snotty son while also trying to find a decent man a long the way. This is an excellent movie, one of the most important films of the 70s finally showing the women as the hero.

  After Hours - After failing to get his Jesus picture funded and the failure of his dark gem The King of comedy Scorsese resorted to a college kids script called After hours. This is pure 80s filmmaking and pure Kafka esque. Showing a man in a nightmare he had no idea he was getting into with no idea how to get out. Definitely a must see. One of the best dark comedies ever made!

  Last but not least GOODFELLAS - Not much to say here. Just the greatest mob film ever made. Goodfellas shows the rise and fall of a group of gangsters from the 60s on. Scorsese directs the film with insight and he puts his electric trademark in every scene. One of the best of all time, this puts the icing on the cake of an excellent collection. It's a Great DVD and an amazing movie that you will appreciate more and more each time.

  There you have it, my long review on a great collection. 5 essential films in Scorsese's career. A must own. 5 OUT OF 5!!!",1134000000,2,2374,4.418390804597701
2066330,5,B000286RR0,"This is a brilliant collection of Scorsese's films, an even better collection than MGM's Scorsese Box Set! It gives us a Special Edition of ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese's first film (finally on DVD) ""Who's That Knocking At My Door?"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", a Special Edition of ""Mean Streets"" and (another finally on DVD) ""After Hours"".

The gems of this collection are Mean Streets, After Hours, and Goodfellas. These three films are considered to be among Scrosese's best! Pick this up today if you're a Scorsese fan, or a film buff, or if you're trying to get into Scorsese's work. Recommended.",1121904000,,603,5.03

2066332,5,B000286RR0,"This collection is the must have of any Marty fan and for that matter of any proper cinephile. Through 5 movies it traces the greatest part of Scorsese's stellar (until gangs of NY) carreer. It is extremely precious since it brings us ""Who's that knocking at my door?"", his first film shot when he was still studying in NYU, for the first time (to my poor French knowledge at least). The box really gives a wonderful overview of the themes that obsessed him in his young years (sex and religion, duty and punition) pictured in WTKAMD and Mean Streets, the film that made him big enough to introduce him to Hollywood, first in B-Movies (""Boxcar Bertha""), then to Oscar winning projects: ""Alice doesn't live here anymore"". This movie is extremely odd since it could seem to be a ""feminist"" film, and Scorsese as anyone will tell you is a guys' director (except for last temptation of Christ, the age of Innocence, Kundun... have I said enough to kill the clich?). This woman ""road movie"" is nothing like ""Thelma and Louise"" but is still a very poignant portrait of a woman trying to put her life back together, but carefull, it's not a women's weepie, it's a strong, nuanced work. Which brings us to ""After Hours"" (one of the projects that ended MS's walk through the desert, along with Raging Bull), this Cannes festival prized movie reconciled MS with the critics and is one of the strangest movies in his carreer, you'll be surprised. And then, possibly his masterpiece, ""Goodfellas"", I don't think I need to say anything, the movie speaks for itself: WONDERFUL WONDERFUL and, oh, I forgot, WONDERFUL!!!

 The DVD's all have commentaries and all of them have other featurettes on the making of the films, or trailers, and Goodfellas is actually the 2 DVD edition. In a word, u NEED to own this !",1101945600,6,1796,4.680379746835443
2066333,1,B000286RR0,"To all buyers out there I implore you to refrain from purchasing this item. NO, not because of the films themselves, they are incredible masterworks of cinema. However, the EXTRAS ARE AWFUL!! If you are a Scorsese fan, let's face it, you already know a lot of the GENERAL INFO in the commentaries and docos. As reviewed by ""Claire Quilty"" & ""Matthew Slaughter"" (Keep it up!!), DO NOT EXPECT enlightening commentary, as per the Criterion Laserdisc audio on Taxi Driver, or the classic Laserdisc release of Raging Bull, with scene specific analysis by Scorsese. Ever since the advent of DVD, SCORSESE HAS BEEN TOO BUSY for specific running film analysis. All he does is general comments in response to an interviewer's questions. The answers are collated, and placed on the Dvds for ""extra material"". (Worthless to the true Scorsese addict, who yearns for more detail, as Scorsese has shown in past efforts). Further, non scene specific generalist commentaries include ""Last Temptation on Criterion Dvd"" and ""Gangs of NY"".",1099612800,16,1020,5.0773809523809526
2066334,4,B000286RR0,"A word of caution to any Scorsese fans out there. This compilation, although quite good on its own, only contains the five films that Scorsese made for Warner Brothers. You wouldn't find his other masterpieces such as Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Last Temptation of Christ etc. here.

Nonetheless, this is still a good set. The best movie of the five featured is of course, Goodfellas. The best movie ever made about blue collar mobsters. The first DVD print was a disgrace and the disc itself was a flipper. It was quite a disconcerting disc itself, with no extras and the menu background being the WB logo wallpaper. Extremely lacklustre. Luckily, the good old boys at WB wised up (perhaps after our money too) decided to give this movie the belated treatment it deserved. I must say that the picture looks great this time round. The surround is also magnificiant. With all the great rock classics playing, you could immerse yourself in the era.

As for the movie itself, Ray Liotta plays a real life mobster, Henry Hill, and the movie non-chalently moves and mows down three decades of life within the ""organisation"". De Niro as Jimmy the Gent, wisely remained as a supporting role, while Liotta's narration drives the story. Joe Pesci is a real gem here. As vulgar as he's psychotic, he embodied the type of loud mouthed, devil-may-care gangster whose actions proves to be his undoing. This movie is a classic on its own. It even outshone The Godfather as the best film of the genre according to some critics' hitlist.

The other four movies are Mean Streets, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Who's That Knocking on my Door and After Hours. Mean Streets had its moments with nostalgic rock music and gritty realism of Little Italy, the world is introduced to a young upstart of an actor in the form of Robert De Niro. Alice is a decent ""chick flick"". If soap opera and melodrama is your type, then this Scorsese film is just for you. Who's That Knocking on my Door, was an early effort from Scorsese when he was a film student. Mean Streets felt like an unofficial sequel or even an extension to this black and white movie. After Hours is the most quirky and kafkaesque of the lot. It's just Scorsese's exercise into indie filmmaking and experimenting within Cronenberg's terroritory.

All in all, the whole box set has a good price. For five movies, it's a bargain, especially when it has the remastered version of Goodfellas thrown in for effect.",1096588800,5,2449,4.7283372365339575
