331801,5,6301524373,"Ground breaking training developed by the vet who started it all. I knew the cameraman and producer of this video in the 80's, Marty Blueford. His father raised Golden 's in Carmel where he met Dr. Dunbar. He told us all about this wonderful Dr. who loved dogs and promoted training puppies and using positive reinforcement. We bought a new Great Dane puppy and knew we had to watch this video and so ordered it from Amazon. I re-watched the video and found it still terrific",1140739200,5,475,4.534883720930233
331877,3,6301524373,"I'd heard many good things about Ian Dunbar, and was even considering taking one of his workshops...until I saw this video.  I found his manner a bit too critical and scolding of the humans in his workshop when they did something he didn't like.  I was surprised when he occasionally hit and shouted at the dogs.  Okay, maybe hitting is the wrong word, it was more like a hard tap, but his manner seemed unnecessary to me.  In fairness, I've been a fan of Karen Pryor and have attended one of her workshops and never saw this negativity towards humans or animals, so I'm probably biased. This video does seem a bit dated, so maybe he's softened in his approach.  There are good things to learn from this, and I was open to learning new ways, but it's unlikely I'll take his workshop.  I'd recommend this video with reservations.",1359676800,3,828,4.523489932885906
331878,2,6301524373,"I thought I was purchasing the ""Dunbar training method""  I guess in retrospect the fact that it is geared to puppies is obvious.  That is when people train their dogs, when they are a few months old and beyond.  Because of Dunbar's famous book ""How to teach an old dog new tricks""  I assumed this video might be geared for older dogs who needed help with some of the basics that may have proven too difficult the first round of puppy classes.
I was very dissapoined given the price point for this video , it is amaturish in production quality and lacks an over arching organization.  It would be a good product if say, you had not chossen your dog yet, and you wanted to see what you are in for commiment wise with training and raiseing a dog.  I wish I could have returned it.  I am still on the look out for a video that deals with dogs over 1 year old.",1355961600,,855,4.176829268292683
331879,1,6301524373,"DVD was Ok, but not very realistic. The classes take place in what looks like a church hall. Not a typical place to be interacting with your puppy. But I'm hopeful I will find something useful in it.",1304553600,,199,4.2631578947368425
331880,4,6301524373,"I thought this DVD was well done. I really like Ian Dunbar. There were a few things I didn't like that he did, such as the way he went about to teach leave it. I thought the loud, scary  noise and the hand bump to the nose was unnecessary, but it was a great resource, none the less. I used a lot of his techniques in a puppy education class I taught.",1297123200,2,351,3.875
331881,5,6301524373,I have been raising pups for over thirty years and find this to be one of the most informative and helpful video for every new puppy owner. I will recommend it to all my puppy buyers.,1292025600,,183,4.111111111111111
331882,5,6301524373,"Instantly after starting this video we were groaning that it was a mistake: made in the 80's, video quality was bad and the people were, well, very 80's-looking.  BUT, the information is compelling.  The training is timeless.  Dunbar is so knowledgable and truly seems to be the best approach to dog training.  Wish there was an updated version, a la Apple products.  But, alas not.  I've never owned a dog before, and highy recommend any Dunbar informational products.",1285372800,,469,4.948717948717949
331883,1,6301524373,"Some of the techniques in this book are laughable at best. ""Whenever your dog pulls on the leash, just stop and stand still, and wait for the dog to come and sit next to you before proceeding with another step""... Are you kidding me? Who has 8 hours to try and walk a puppy around the block with this method?

Yes, there are some useful ideas in this book, but for real working people who can't spend 24/7 with their dog, it just isn't reasonable.",1282089600,3,447,4.258823529411765
331884,2,6301524373,"AAAAh, this video is really old like from the 70s - 80s, although it has some useful things, it is a bit boring.",1271635200,2,112,3.9130434782608696
331885,5,6301524373,"I bought this video before purchasing my 8 week old puppy, but didn't actually watch it until the puppy was 5 1/2 months old.  Big mistake!  Although this video was made many years ago, the training techniques shown by Ian Dunbar are very fresh.  He is the grandfather of the ""kinder, gentler"" approach to the dog training methods that have become so popular today. I highly recommend this video to ALL new puppy owners!",1268784000,5,420,4.648648648648648
331886,2,6301524373,I purchased this video(sent 2day to have for the weekend)spending $35 + $15 shipping. I was sold on the 5-5star reviews it had gotten. First off. This video is at least 30 years old.as can be seen by the 1970 toyota truck in the video and clothing. I just expected a newer.modern.fresh vid with up to date techniques and training. Second.the video is basically a large.disorganized puppy class taped with an old video camera. I guess I was expecting more of a one on one class with a more personal feel with the trainer and maybe one or two students.really giving you the feel of a quality training video I paid for. And finally.the vid to me didn't really teach me any of the questions I really wanted to know like what to do when my puppy goes crazy and how to calm him(Do I give him a time out. Let him play it out.etc)or how to socialize him(with other dogs.bringing him to meet new people and social situations.etc)The video is so broad and general it barley touches on anything specific which is why I have a problem with the quality and old(date).Dont get me wrong. I think the basis of training a new puppy hasn't probably changed much but I think if this was taped in 2008 for example it would be much more personal and specific(to the point).I would have felt alot better spending $9.95 max and not $15 rush shipping because the 5star rating I thought it was a must have asap to spend my weekend off using all the great (techniques) shown in the vid. If you want a video that is very very general and vague and mostly(common sense)this is the video for you! If i would have been able to see a preview or sneek peek of this dvd I would have never bought it. Shame on people giving this a 5star rating. That is the highest mark or praise for anything and I read all reviews when I buy most things(especially of amazon)and this one was definattly a dude!!!!!!,1267920000,24,1866,4.395953757225434
331932,5,6301524373,This DVD made teaching my 13 week old puppy so easy. Everything he demonstrated worked. This is even better than paying a trainer to come to the house because I can go back to the DVD any time I have a question or need to review. I also liked his positive reinforcement techniques. This is highly recommended to anyone with a new puppy!,1264809600,,336,4.349206349206349
331933,5,6301524373,"I'm coming back to the Sirius Puppy training, for my new pup.  Fifteen years ago, we took the Sirius Puppy training class with our first dog in the Bay Area.  Little did we know what a fantastic experience this series of classes were.  Now these classes aren't available where we live, and I'm sad to say the ones that are here, have be HORRIBLE!!!  So, I'm having the class come to me in DVD form.  Ian Dunbar needs to bring these classes to EVERY area of the US, because quite simply, the experience was exceptional; just as this video is.  Your pup will grow to be an amazing dog, with these early training techniques.",1247875200,4,621,4.4035087719298245
331934,5,6301524373,It is really a great tape for training any puppy. I hope more people will start training their dogs this way.,1235347200,,109,4.238095238095238
331935,5,6301524373,"This is the video everyone who has, or better yet is going to get a puppy- should see.  Easy quick effective training your pup will understand. Best video out there for the puppy owner.  Get a copy for a friend too!  :)",1227052800,2,219,4.166666666666667
331936,5,6301524373,This is an excellent video for anyone with a new puppy.  We started using Ian Dunbar's instructions on our new puppy and it's amazing how quickly this training works.,1205798400,8,166,4.724137931034483
331937,5,6301524373,"I got this program several years ago to train our puppy, and it was a great help. At the time, I had no idea that Dr. Ian Dunbar was one of greatest positive dog trainers around. Turns out the program has won numerous awards and is quite a best-seller. It recently came out in DVD.

I watched it again recently, and was struck again by how useful it is.

Many of the people taking the puppy training class are children themselves -- some look as young as four or five years old. This would be an excellent video for children to watch. Both kids and adults can benefit from watching Sirius Puppy Training several times.

I think that even people with a fair amount of dog experience would benefit from Sirius Puppy Training -- unless they have already watched other programs of Ian Dunbar's. I'm a great book lover, but the DVD gives you a lot that you couldn't get from his (or anyone's) books.

Note that the program is designed for puppies under the age of 18 weeks without major behavior problems.",1202428800,28,1000,4.448087431693989
331938,5,6301524373,"Dr. Dunbar is an advocate of positive reinforcement techniques. There is no shouting or pushing down on puppy's rump to get him to sit. it's all about luring the dog with little treats and praise to reinforce the behaviors that you want. Every move is demonstrated clearly and explained. The DVD--which is identical to the VHS version--shows the entire family working with the puppy, even the very small children. Dr. Dunbar also addresses common behavioral problems and their solutions.
This DVD worked great for my family and our new rescue puppy because we could start her training at home before she was old enough for classes. Training *is* essential for the happiness of the whole family and can save your dog's life. Highly recommended.",1202428800,13,743,5.0
331939,4,6301524373,"Sirius Puppy training shows the first-time and experienced puppy owner how to teach their puppy the sit, down, stand, off, come, and stay commands as well as bite inhibition, greeting people, etc. all through rewarding lavishly with praise and food treats.  Parts of actual training classes with Dr. Ian Dunbar are included in this 90 minute VHS tape as well as helpful suggestions on puppy potty training and general handling tips. It is both humorous and entertaining while being informative.  Segues well into a puppy training class in your area.",1153699200,4,549,5.088888888888889
331940,5,6301524373,"This is an excellent video for a new puppy owner!  Even though I've had dogs all my life, it's been a long time since I had a puppy and wanted to make sure I did it right.

The video is like taking a ""puppy kindergarten"" training course, but without the other puppies.  You will learn a lot from watching, and re-watching, the positive training methods used.  It is especially helpful to see how the owners each overcome unique difficulties with their dogs (a slow malamute, a shy Westie, a hyper Golden, etc.)

The only downside to the video is that it is designed for puppies under the age of 18 weeks-- once they hit adolescence, while you can still use positive training methods, you will probably also need some corrections.",1153267200,4,729,4.576923076923077
331941,5,6301524373,"I found the information awesome.  I found myself wanting to watch it over and over again.  It is packed full of information, watching situations as they naturally present themselves and ideas.  I hope Ian Dunbar does many more of these classroom environment tapes in DVD too ... I love watching trainers & dogs in action.",1151884800,,321,4.8

7812166,5,6301524373,Great video to watch for owners of puppies.  I watched it right after I brought home our pup and the techniques are very helpful.  She quickly learned to sit and lay down.  I now need to take her to the actual class.,1411344000,,216,4.095238095238095
7812167,3,6301524373,"This video reflects some of the best training methods utilized over the years by respected animal behaviorists, and includes some of Dr. Dunbar's techniques.

Based on experience, watching the video maybe an alternative to attending a Dunbar Seminar.  Some friends and I attended his workshop that we were informed was to be held at a hotel, period. Upon arrival, we discovered much to our great dismay that the Dunbar seminar and our overnight accommodations were both located in a welfare....hotel; the building reeked of industrial cleaning chemicals and the noise level was ongoing night and day, 24 hours.  The idea that a Doctor in Animal Behavior would expect attendees to book seminar and overnight reservations at a welfare hotel without informing the attendees is beyond comprehension.

Another alternative worth considering might be to contact a top notch College or University with a highly rated veterinary and animal behavioral clinic that offers quality seminars to dog owners, and trainers at locations that do not place one's health or safety at risk.",1394668800,,1068,5.264705882352941

7812169,5,6301524373,Dr. Dunbar is top notch! As a professional dog trainer I find his lure/reward approach to be the easiest to teach to dog owners and it really improves the relationship between dog and owner.,1378252800,,190,4.617647058823529
