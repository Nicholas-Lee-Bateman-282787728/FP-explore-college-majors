The acting and dialogue in these old movies are pretty much the same, see one and you've seen them all pretty much.",1409788800,2,260,4.22
2963471,1,B000W927D2,The usual Roman movie fare.  All of the characters speak with an awful fake English accent and eat strange things while drinking wine out of lead tainted metal goblets.,1398902400,,168,4.793103448275862

2963473,4,B000W927D2,A very good Cameron Mitchell movie!!! I strongly recommend this movie for all Cameron Mithell fans and fans of movies about ancient Rome!,1388620800,,137,5.0
2963474,1,B000W927D2,"I knew this movie was a bad recording to begin with. I have never seen a good recording of this movie but I decided to take my chance on this one. Unwatchable is all I can say. The absolutely worst movie transfer of all time. It is hard to believe that a company would even sell this much less package as a new movie. I would give it a negative 5 star for the ripoff that it is. Buyer Beware,run from this one. It is a great movie if someone could find the original production cut to remaster.",1375056000,3,493,4.040816326530612
2963475,4,B000W927D2,"Actually,this movie is not that bad story wise,and if you find a version with restored picture some of the shots are quite beautiful. I like the music as well. Cameron Mitchell made a great Julius Caesar(only I hate that they had some British guy do his voice,YUCK!).A thouroughly enjoyable film,especially if you are a Cam Mitchell fan (like ME!)and enjoy lots of action packed battle scenes and tough Romans in togas and armor. Make Jesus your Lord before its too late! God Bless.",1372464000,5,482,4.819277108433735
2963476,1,B000W927D2,"Avoid! This is an italian disasterpiece, with nothing to offer its viewer.
  (If Cameron Mitchell cant save it,believe me,no one can!)
Whats even worse then the film itself,is the  technical quality of the
print Alpha home entertainment used to master this dvd. Dont buy it!

8221768,2,B000W927D2,"Not much of a story line, more of a historical account. The production values may have been par for the course in 1961 but are bad even compared to B movies today.",1468540800,,163,4.125
8221769,1,B000W927D2,unless you enjoy campy dated material this is a waste of server space.,1465257600,,70,4.461538461538462

8221772,3,B000W927D2,"It is very old, largely melodramatic but basically historically accurate. It has been done better in the TV series ROME, and Cameron Mitchell - in his twilight years - is generally credible.",1439596800,,190,4.96875
8221773,1,B000W927D2,"I'm not sure what they were going for with this one.  Caesar conquers the Gauls and watches a boxing match.  He is so entertained he puts the winner, Vercingetorix, in charge.  He promptly rebels.  There is an argument in the Senate about whether or not Caesar has too much power.  Then Caesar decides to marry his ward to his friend, an important general.  He sends her through rebellious Gaul where she naturally gets captured an Vercingetorix holds her for ransom.  She escapes, there are some battles, and Caesar wins.  I'm not sure where they were going with the character of Vercingetorix.  One moment he's being very noble, talking about fighting for the rights of the Gauls, the next he's chopping off a guy's hand because the guy didn't have enough horses.  The fight scenes and costumes are terrible.  This movie also ends with what may be the worst closing line ever.  Caesar thinks to himself, ""I've conquered men but I'll never conquer their spirit, which is indomitable, like those clouds."" Camera pans to clouds.  THE END.",1438214400,,1037,4.823863636363637
8221774,3,B000W927D2,It is a nice movie to watch but it was a little confusing as to what action was aking place.,1426896000,,92,3.65
8221775,2,B000W927D2,"For an early 1950s movie not too bad.  Acting was stilted, no historical accuracy, by today's standards most  scenes were unbelievable.  Good to wath to see how far we've come in 65 years!",1412380800,,188,4.636363636363637
