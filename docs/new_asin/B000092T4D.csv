Very predictable movies but people who are a fan of these types of movies(Underworld, Bloodrayne, etc.) will like these movies. Action packed with lots of sexy vampiress scenes to please the inner fanboy in all of us! 'Nuff said!",1393459200,2,328,4.483333333333333
1876812,5,B000092T4D,"Talisa Soto is what can I say, but Fangtastically Hot in this movie. She really shines & pops as the title character in this clawsome movie. While I haven't seen it in awhile, I do look forward to watching it again. I had had it on VHS originally, but later got rid of my collection in favor of DVD's. So I was very happy to be able to get my claws on it just recently. I don't know much about the movie that accompanies it, but it looks fangtastic too. I don't remember much about Vampirella to give many details about it, but I know I loved watching it. I can't be too specific about it as my memory of the details has faded over time. Sorry. I did look for the length of it to make sure it was the longest & best one to get. I also looked for the Special Features as well to give some background on it & cause I'm a geek. Hoped this helped some. Just sink your fangs into these two & enjoy! I got this copy on Amazon, but originally had it on VHS.",1366329600,3,950,3.953125

7988574,4,B000092T4D,"The good folks at New Concorde digitally remastered this pair of vamp camp flicks, yielding an excellent picture quality (albeit still at a 4:3 ratio). Furthermore, Vampirella director Jim Wynorski, who is known for dozens of questionable productions like CobraGator, Busty Cops and the Jewel of Denial, Shark Babes, and Munchie, is featured on an added audio commentary track.

Night Hunter (1996), not ""Nighthunter,"" is rated R for strong violence and some language. ~85 minutes
The rules for vampires in this flick are: [1] sunlight is bothersome to the eyes, but not harmful, and [2] true death only comes when the vampire's back is broken (??)
Well, 2 points for originality, I guess.

There is precisely one good actor in Night Hunter: it's Melanie Smith, who you can be forgiven for not remembering as Ziyal in Deep Space Nine (she wore a prosthetic face). The other protagonist, the son of an Asian Van Helsing, is played by 11-time kickboxing world champion Don 'The Dragon' Wilson. Apparently in 1996 it was helpful to kick vampires in battle, so he was the obvious choice for the role. The antagonists (the vampires) are so awful that you can only laugh not to cry. Scream queen fans may recognize Maria Ford who here plays Tournier, a vampire with a very poorly done French accent who makes very strange noises while in battle.

Although Night Hunter got off to a promising start, the first sign that something was terribly wrong occurred during a restaurant fight scene in which the opposite of a Steadicam was used to shoot the scene (you think ""found footage"" movies are bad? they are nothing compared to this: I almost vommed due to the very extreme camera movements). Subsequent fight scenes also used similar cheap and ridiculous camera tricks to promote the illusion of action, so be sure to take some Dramamine before watching Night Hunter. It's a solid 2-star flick, maybe more if you watch it as camp (I'm not entirely sure it was intended to be camp).

Vampirella (1996) is rated R for violence and some nudity. ~86 minutes (longer than the theatrical release)
Vamp camp doesn't get any better than this. It starts on the planet Drakulon (I'm not kidding). Roger Daltrey (yes, that Roger Daltrey) plays not only the worst vampire ever, he also is a rock star playing a rock star for an excruciating couple of minutes in this director's cut (the song was mostly edited out for the theatrical release). It's clear that Daltrey was out to have some fun and maybe score with actresses during filming, so you just have to roll with it. Talisa Soto as Vampirella is of course the real reason to watch the film (unless you're an obsessive Daltrey fan). She wears an uncomfortable looking getup that is, essentially, a major reason to bother watching Vampirella at all.

Sample dialogue:
Talisa Soto: You are much stronger than I am.
Roger Daltrey: At the risk of sounding egotistical, I am stronger than anyone.

The film was made for $1M, which adjusted for inflation is still only about $1.6M today. Jim Wynorski knows how to stretch a dollar (e.g., using the ""legal advisor"" for the film as a vampire extra), and the director's commentary track goes into detail about how he was able to pull off a Vampirella with Roger Daltrey and Talisa Soto (and what he wasn't able to do that he had wanted to) for only $1M. Despite being notorious for exploitation films, Wynorski comes across as humble (for a director), someone who continually praises others involved in all aspects of getting Vampirella to the screen.

I found Vampirella more entertaining with Wynorski's commentary track turned on. Fun facts from it:
' In a fight scene, Talisa Soto (Vampirella) was supposed to swing and miss but instead connected, breaking the nose of Tom Deters, who was at the time recovering from a nose injury.
' Wynorski claims this is the first screen presentation of a government vampire eradication agency (here Operation Purge), an idea that was later used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;(The Initiative in season 4).
' Vampirella fans cried bloody murder when this film was released because Vampirella's costume was not true to its source. In fact, Wynorski had wanted to use a more authentic costume, but Soto declined to wear it because it surely would have led to numerous wardrobe malfunctions.
' Roger Daltrey took pride in bringing his vampire character to life, which included the idea of wearing lipstick (it was not a good look for him).
' Vampirella's enemy Sallah is played by a former Playboy Playmate of the early 90s, Corinna Harney (who is sure to take her shirt off in one scene because hey, why not).

Final thoughts: Both movies focus on vampire hunters, yet despite Van Helsing flicks being my least favorite subgenre of vamp flicks, I don't regret watching either. A barrel of laughs, but don't expect more.",1441670400,5,4982,5.001206272617612
7988575,4,B000092T4D,"This movie will never happen a great classic, but it was great fun in the vain of Rocky Horror.",1438646400,2,95,4.052631578947368
7988576,3,B000092T4D,"I bought this dvd just to view the ""Vampirella"" movie. This double feature dvd was a better buy for me.
As expected, Vampirella is a B movie. The special effects are really low grade. The film's
basic plot and story line sort of follows the comic book version of why vampires exist in our world.
The best part of the film is the lead actress (Talisa Soto) as Vampirella. She has no nude scenes in
this movie, but she has an on screen presence. For most of the movie she walks and runs around in a red bathing
suit in black boots, but she manages to look sexy even all covered up in an overcoat. Have to give some credit to
the film's camera man and the director for this. Except for Ms. Soto, the acting this film is pretty much as expected
for a B movie. Most of the cast appears stiff, over acts or hams it up way too much. By comparison Ms. Soto,
looking comfortable just saying her lines in front of the camera, manages to out class everyone acting in this film.
Without Ms. Soto this in this film, I would have rated it only a one-star movie. There is no Talisa Soto in ""Nighthunter"" so
I rated it as a one-star movie, maybe.",1429747200,4,1130,4.1880733944954125
