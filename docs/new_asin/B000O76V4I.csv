2791322,4,B000O76V4I,"Koch Vision presents ""MCLEOD'S DAUGHTERS: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SEASON"" (Released: 15 February 2006) (1380 mins/Color) (Dolby Digital) --- McLeod's Daughters is an Australian television drama set in the rural outback --- This release presents all 32 episodes from the sixth season of MCLEOD`S DAUGHTERS. Claire (Lisa Chappell) and Tess (Bridie Carter) are the two daughters of the title --- Drover's Run is a large cattle property 180km from the nearest town and 400km from the city. It has been in the McLeod family for generations, passed down from father to... and now to daughter.

In the sixth season thirty two new episodes, the saga of McLEOD'S DAUGHTERS continues as Jodi takes her place as co-owner of Drover's Run, Nick and Tess say their final goodbye, Stevie and Alex's relationship continues to be bumpy and a turbulent year of events will see many changes in all of their lives --- Capturing every moment of drama from the sensational sixth series, this presentation is a `must-own' collectible for any fan of this landmark television series.

Koch Vision has released McLeod's Daughters: The Complete Sixth Season, another massive box set, 32-episode compilation of what was a few years ago, Australia's favorite nighttime drama --- This season (which originally aired from February 15, 2006) includes a shocking departure for one of the series' regulars, along with the requisite numbers of misunderstandings, family squabbles, frustrated dreams, unrequited longings, shady, long-lost relatives, near-fatal accidents, and of course, lots of (usually off-screen) hooking up, that make up your average stint on a rural Australian cattle farm. It's an expertly crafted sudser which keeps drawing me along, season after season.

I think this is better than season 5 and can't wait for season 7 and 8. I've got my friends hooked!",1215734400,3,273,4.372549019607843
2791324,5,B000O76V4I,"I watched these girls on TV and they went off the air.  Now I follow then on dvd.... I can't wait for the next season to be released.  The McLeod's are a true to live family...Loves, drama and family life..",1215129600,,206,4.125

Put some Shrimp on the Barbie and enjoy",1214784000,2,238,4.085106382978723
2791326,5,B000O76V4I,"McLeod's Daughters Season Six was great. Just finished watching all the DVD's last night. Can hardly wait to get Season 7. Too bad Season 8 will be the last one. I'm so glad Amazon carries this series. They have been super to deal with also. Would tell anyone that likes country lifestyle to buy these DVD's. The characters in this series are believable and not overdone as in so many of the current shows. There have been character changes, but they always find good replacements to keep the story interesting.",1214697600,4,511,4.688888888888889
2791327,5,B000O76V4I,"Another exjoyable season of ""McLeod's Daughters."" Regret We channel
discontinued the series. That's the reason I purchase all the releases.",1214697600,,139,6.0
2791328,4,B000O76V4I,"I'm in the middle of Season 6 and enjoying every minute of it. Of course I miss the characters from the first three seasons but it's still over all enjoyable and one of the best shows around. I already can't wait to order Season 7, I hope it's available soon. Still a great show.",1214179200,2,279,4.185185185185185
2791329,4,B000O76V4I,"I have watched this season on you tube for the most part so I was spoiled to the many heartbreaking cast defections that occur in this and the seventh season-I agree this season becomes more melodramatic ( Harry's murder and Stevie's arrest) but the actors do it so well that you can't be too upset by it...Nothing will beat the tightly written seasons 1-3 but I still enjoy this show over 95% of US television(still love Heroes,CSI and like Grey's Anatomy(another show going the soap route to mixed results) I must say season 7 goes to 3 stars(don't care for Grace) but I have read many older cast members(Becky,Tess,Nick) will be back to wrap up this series in season 8-let's hope so...still worth it for beautiful scenery,some fine acting by leads(Rachel Carpani really comes into her own this season and starting to warm up to Regan)and the wonderful music! Watch for Rebecca Lavelle in a later episode celebrating Gungellans centennial celebration-she does all the songs for this show!",1213833600,2,990,4.898809523809524
2791330,5,B000O76V4I,"I very much enjoyed Season 6.  I was so dissapointed with season 5 (i gave it only 2 stars) because it seemed very soap-opera-ish.  And I really thought it would all go downhill from there.  However, I still wanted to get season 6 but didn't want to wait till it came out in the US, so I got a hold of an AU region 4 copy.  I also found season 6 on youtube, and it was so good I had already watched a third of the season on youtube before my copy came in the mail.  I just couldn't help myself.

If you are a Mcleod's fan, this was definitely a great season.  As I said in my Season 5 review, the show is getting to be more about the people on the show than the running of the farm, but that is ok because this season there were many interesting twists and turns in the plot.  the Nick/Tess thing, the Jodi/Matt thing, I don't want to say too much other than it was a great season and definitely worth the price to add it to your McLeod's collection.",1209772800,22,950,3.9894179894179893

I bought ""The Complete Sixth series"" of McLeod's daughters from a company from Long Beach, California.(givesatanthefinger) The series should have come in a box containing four DVDs and each DVD contains two discs.

2791441,5,B000O76V4I,"This whole TV series is great.  I had never heard of it until I saw it advertised in a brochure that came with a Heartland DVD I had ordered.  It is an Australian series that ran for 8 season, about women/sisters running a cattle/sheep ranch in Australia in modern times.  Of course the ranch next door is owned by a rich landowner that has two sons that are constantly involved with the women.  I will warn you up front the show can be very emotional.  Wait till you get to the end of season two and you will understand why I said that.  Over the length of the series, there are changes to the main characters as they come and go for different reasons.  However the series ties it all together very well.  I am not quite sure who the prime audience for this show is.  In Australia it was extremely popular with the women.  I suggest you do like I do, when first trying out a new series, and just order season 1 at first.  If you like season one as much as I did, you will be hooked, and then end up ordering all the other seasons.  Just one comment, don't just watch the first episode before making a decision.  Give the show a chance and watch at least the first half dozen or so episodes, if not the entire first season, before making up your mind.",1354838400,,1251,4.184100418410042

2791445,5,B000O76V4I,"I started watching this show a few years ago when it aired on the WE network.  When they quit airing it I started purchasing each season.  This show has been addictive!  Although now that I'm in the last season there are so many new characters that I'm not enjoying it as much, however I still need to see how it ends!",1310688000,,318,4.180327868852459

2791447,5,B000O76V4I,"This is an extraordinary australian serie that we have seen through long time in cable television in Hallmark's channel that unfortunately disappeared, because it presented great programms and series and all of them with spanish subtitles.

I look forward in Amazon to buy different series that can be seen as an entertainment by my 97 years old mother, but surprise! the series I bought from the McLeods daughters and Angela Lansbury's series of Murder she wrote, do not have spanish subtitles, so, she is not having the joy I thought she will have with the series I bought for her and I am truly dissapointed by the waste of effort and money because they do not accomplish my intention.

I have already sent this worry to Amazon because, when we buy a product we do not have the certainty that it comes with the different languages and specially the spanish subtitles we need for my mother, although she could understand english, she has an evident loss of a neet hearing, that forces her to read the spanish subtitles in order to know what is going on in the programme.

I hope you understand our problem, that I am sure it is not only ours because ther is a lot of death people that will be greatful to know that the product they are purchasing is the one they need and it can easily be solved by putting in the general details of the product the information that it has spanish subitles and I am sure you will be selling a lot more.

Thank you again for your interest in solving this problems.

Sincerely yours,
