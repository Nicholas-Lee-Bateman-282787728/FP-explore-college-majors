1437642,2,B00005JKMG,"Until they made this film, in my book, the Coen Brothers were
8-0 (or, more properly, 7-0-1--`The Big Lebowski' was
sporadically entertaining, but also obnoxious).
  This is their first mark in the loss column.
  It should be pointed out that my admiration for the Coens
is quite the opposite of the critical norm.  Those films of
 theirs usually held in highest regard by the critics
 (like `Fargo' and `Blood Simple') I only think of as good,
 while their least respected work, often deemed ""superficial""
 (`Miller's Crossing', `The Hudsucker Proxy', `Barton Fink'
 and `O' Brother Where Art Thou?') I love to the core for their
 passion, innovation, and playfulness.
  So when the critics started to gush over this one, I should
 have sensed trouble.
  Instead, I suffered--actually suffered!--through a truly
 boring film.
  Suffered?  From the Coen Brothers?
  `The Man Who Wasn't There' is a lifeless husk of a film.
 The ""superficial"" tag once batted around (far too easily) by
 the critics finally applies.  The water here is half an inch
 deep.  It has a lovely surface reflection, but, despite the
 wealth of ""theme"" hinted at throughout the script (but never
 developed) there's really nothing here to get your ankles wet.
  And slow.
  My lord, slow!
  What's surprising is that the Coens have already proven
 themselves adroit at snappy banter and rattlesnake
 pacing.  `The Hudsucker Proxy' and `Miller's Crossing' both
 play fast and tight with words and plot.  That makes it all the
 more puzzling that this film, which owes its existence to taut
 films like `Double Indemnity' and to the writing of the so
-called ""Boys In The Back Room"" like McCoy and Burnett and Cain,
 completely abandons the lightening-quick approach of the hard
-boiled tradition.
  Instead, it's so ponderous it's stiff.
  Watching `The Man Who Wasn't There', I kept trying to
 convince myself that the lulling rhythm was intentional, meant
 to direct my eye or my brain or my ear to something beyond the
 surface, something more rewarding.
  Didn't.
  Read a James M. Cain novel instead, or watch a movie
 like `Scarlet Street'.  In this instance, go to the source.
  PEOPLE WHO'LL LIKE THIS FILM: I am both a stone Coen
 Brothers fan and a stone hard-boiled fan, and I didn't dig it;
 I suppose philosophy majors might like it, and indie-boosters.",1018051200,13,2339,4.968586387434555
1437643,4,B00005JKMG,"Billy Bob Thornton gives a beautifully understated performance as a low-key barber who's sudden urge for revenge ends up, in baby-steps, ruining his life. This Coen brothers gem also features wonderful supporting work from Frances McDormand, as Thornton's unfaithful wife, and Tony Shalhoub, as a fast-talking lawyer.

1437718,5,B00005JKMG,"Judged strictly by the usual cinematic standards, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" doesn't deserve five stars, but closer to three. However, like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" this isn't so much a drama as a novel of ideas on celluloid. The core idea here is the hollowness of modern bourgeois life. I confess that I don't much like that as a theme, and dozens of filmmakers--often European--have justified my skepticism. Almost all previous explorations of that territory have been by self-styled artistes, who use their films to spew their contempt for ordinary folk. Such efforts generally produce unwatchable results; in less skilled hands, this film, too, could easily have joined that inglorious tradition.

The Coens make it work because they eschew ""art"" in favor of superb craftsmanship. They put story and character above mere ""messaging,"" weaving one of their usual complex film noir tales, in which just about everyone is guilty of something. But most of all, this film works because the Coens don't look down on their characters. I don't agree that bourgeois existence is necessarily hollow, but if we assume so for the sake of argument, then it's a common human problem for all to contemplate, not a self-evident justification for the elite to despise the masses.

Ed Crane, played with both intensity and restraint by Billy Bob Thornton, is the archetype ""Man Who Wasn't There."" A barber in Santa Rosa, CA, in the late 1940s, Ed is practically invisible: to his fellow citizens, his customers, his boss, and even to his wife. Ed talks very little, and doesn't like chattiness in others. He has a vague sense that he's supposed to be content with his life, an equally vague longing for something more, and nothing but will-o-the-wisps to satisfy that longing. Ed's actions and reflections throughout the film show that he is invisible even to himself. He learns that his wife is having an affair with her boss. He then blackmails the boss to get money for a shady investment, and ends up killing him in a subsequent fight. Next, he watches his wife get tried and executed for the killing he had committed; and finally he gets executed himself, for a different crime he didn't commit. Through it all, he neither shows nor feels any emotion--as if his own life is just a boring, black-and-white movie that has put him halfway to sleep.

But the Coens show us something more, which I confess I failed to appreciate seeing the film on its initial release. All of the major characters share Ed's emptiness of life; they differ from him only in that they manage to lie to themselves about it. Ed's wife, Doris (Frances McDormand), doesn't know why she married Ed; she gets neither sex nor financial support (her own salary supplies her needs) nor emotional sustenance from the relationship. Her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini), is in an equally loveless marriage with the heiress to the department store he runs. Like Ed, his only hope for a better life involves stealing and deceit: sleeping with Ed's wife; embezzling from the family business; claiming to be a combat hero of the Pacific campaign, whereas in fact he spent the war as an Army clerk in San Diego.

Big Dave's wife, Ann (Katherine Borowitz), is resigned to an empty existence. She believes that her husband withdrew from her because he was abducted by aliens, who must have done something to him before bringing him back to Earth. Local attorney Walter Abundas (Richard Jenkins)--the closest thing Ed has to a friend--is an unhappy, boozy widower whose hobby is genealogy: that is, he spends his time symbolically searching for his own identity. After Doris's execution, Ed tries to bond with Walter's gorgeous, high-school aged daughter, Birdy (Scarlett Johansson), on the pretext of helping her develop a career as a pianist. Ed takes Birdy to meet a world-famous piano teacher in San Francisco; the teacher says he can't help the girl because, while her technique is OK, she lacks the inner spirit of a true musician--she has nothing inside.

The task of voicing the movie's theme goes to Ed's pricey out-of-town attorney, Freddy Reidenschneider (Tony Shalhoub). At Ed's murder trial, Freddy tries to sow reasonable doubt with a meaningless bit of high-sounding schtick, loosely based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. He tells the jury they can't be sure what happened, because, with Ed, ""the closer you look, the less you see."" That's the nub of it: from a distance, Ed looks like any decent, respectable resident of Santa Rosa. But up close, he disappears. And so do the people around him.

It's a dangerous concept for a film: the main character is not a hero, nor even an anti-hero, but just a nullity. That's why, as I said, by the conventional rules of drama, the story just does not add up to anything. But, unlike 99 out of 100 movies that are supposed to ""really make you think,"" this one does.",1468108800,5,4878,4.892382103990326

This film is one of the most impressive black and white films I have eve seen. It stands amongst the mightiest and more legendary film noir in my opinion. The pacing is mostly intense, and never boring. The camera work is tops. The acting is sublime at every turn. There may be some that will not be into this film as a matter of taste, but I do not think it would be due to any flaw of the film. Find yourself surprised at the turn each actor takes with characters you are likely not familiar seeing said actors play.

1437952,5,B00005JKMG,"The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) is a superbly entertaining, brilliantly wrought and deeply knowing neo-noir film from those pre-eminent genre-benders, the Coen brothers. Genre cinema has always been meat and drink for them and they have produced a series of hugely inventive films which dazzle by injecting original verve into something that should be long dead. Latterly they have moved on to the western (No Country For Old Men [2007], True Grit [2011]) as well as broader comic fair that strays away from the strict parameters of genre (Intolerable Cruelty [2003], A Serious Man [2010]). For 18 years though, from their first feature Blood Simple (1983) through to the present film their main point of reference was the classic Hollywood genre cinema of the 1930s/40s - the screwball comedy world of Frank Capra, Preston Sturges and Howard Hawks (Raising Arizona [1987], The Hudsucker Proxy [1994], O Brother, Where Art Thou? [2000]) and the film noir world of Dashiel Hammett, Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain as realized on screen by various directors like Hawks, Billy Wilder, Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang.

Interestingly, the Coens had resisted pure noir for a long time. Blood Simple is a combination of Cain (Wilder's Double Indemnity [1944]) and Hammett's novel Red Harvest, but it is set in the present day and crosses into Roman Polanski psycho-horror territory as well (think Repulsion [1965]). Miller's Crossing (1990) is a combination of two Hammett novels - The Glass Key and Red Harvest, but plays more as a gangster picture than film noir. Then there is The Big Lebowski's hilarious comic riff on Chandler (and Hawks') The Big Sleep (1946) again up-dated and turned into a bizarre post-modern mixture of Sturges screwball comedy and Thomas Pynchon. As the Coens have said in interview, to fit the 'genre' description a film has to stay within its genre parameters and can't cross over and 'fudge' with anything else. With this in mind The Man Who Wasn't There is the first noir they have made that ticks almost all the right boxes. It dwells on criminality in an urban environment, focusing on greed, infidelity, murder, blackmail and all things dark that lie buried deep within the human psyche. It deploys an echt-Cain plot instigated by the main protagonist (joke ref: Ed Crane/Cain - Geddit?) which goes spectacularly wrong. It is unremittingly serious (as epitomized by Billy Bob Thornton's marvelous comatose central performance) almost to the point of absurdist parody. The narrative is related in the first person via the customary noir-voiceover looking back from a point in the future. It is made in b/w to give an extraordinary other-worldly steely edge to the watered-down German-expressionist emphasis on extreme shadow and light that is the signature of all film noir. The film also rejects the revisionist neo-noirs (Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye [1973], Polanski's Chinatown [1974]) which added immoral twists (commenting on the then-incumbent Nixon administration) to a genre which really belongs to the deeply moral world of the 1940s where all the classic noirs ended with the baddies suitably punished. The only box The Man Who Wasn't There doesn't tick is the fact that it wasn't made within the prescribed time period 1937-53 (the dates of two iconic Fritz Lang pictures - You Only Live Once and The Big Heat - which arguably book-end the genre). The film is set in 1949 which makes it the purest noir the Coens have ever produced. The fact that 13 years have passed with no new noir project in sight suggests it may well be their last.

Now, some people have little time for genre film. They see it as a purely commercial off-shoot of an art form and can't understand why obviously talented directors like the Coens would waste their time with it. It's true genre cinema is very popular and has been used and abused down the years by studios and film companies all too quick to cash in on a way to tailor product to the market and play audiences for suckers. Most genre cinema is commercial garbage as a result with mindless films endlessly repeating formulas with little artistic worth. The best genre films however stand above this by connecting with the culturally determined popular sub-conscience. They 'write large' basic impulses that inform our daily lives and behavior patterns. The very best succeed in exposing these hidden impulses and cultural trends in new and radical ways and in fact are so sharp and acute that I would claim they deserve to be placed alongside the very best art films. In the case of post-war film noir the films in question reflected the heightened ennui that befell average people as the men returned from World War Two and home lives returned to normal. Life in 'average' small town America seemed even more mundane because of the politico-social upheavals that had preceded it. People's itchy secret desires 'for something more in life' needed to be fulfilled and it was this demand that film noir in particular addressed. People could knowingly (or not) play out their secret desires in the darkness of the movie theatre rather than indulging in criminal activity themselves.

The Man Who Wasn't There is set in Santa Rosa, California - a place noir aficionados will instantly associate with Hitchcock's 1943 noir, Shadow of a Doubt which centered on a girl named Charlie and her desire to escape her boring town. As if in answer to her prayer, her alter ego Uncle Charlie (note the same name) comes to stay and of course livens up the place with his immorality (he is a serial killer). Charlie's character is reflected in the Coens' film by the character of Birdy Abundas (Scarlett Johansson), an adolescent incarcerated in the same provincial backwater yearning for escape. In fact, just as in Shadow of a Doubt, all the characters in The Man Who Wasn't There are trapped by the boredom of their provincial lives and crave excitement.

Skipping over our taciturn tonsure main character for the moment, there's his `femme fatale' duplicitous wife Doris (a fabulous portrait of dowdy cynical vanity by Frances McDormand) who vents her frustration through boozing and carrying on an affair with her boss in the department store where she cooks the books. She hopes for career advancement and material wealth. Her boss is Big Dave Brewster (the versatile James Gandolfini), a returned `war hero' who announces himself as the new Messiah of materialism in little Santa Rosa. To say what he is frustrated about and running away from would be telling. Doris' family owns the barber store where Ed works. It's run by her amiable brother Frank (Michael Badalucco in fine motor mouth form) a man happy with his simple small town existence, but who eventually feels its limitations like everyone else. Other characters are Big Dave's wife Ann (Katherine Borowitz) who is paralyzed by the fear of aliens, and Birdy's father Walter Abundas (a very funny Richard Jenkins) who presides over everyone, but abrogates his responsibilities from the inside of a whisky bottle. No wonder his daughter wants to leave. Circling these lovely small town folks are a couple of sharks sniffing for meat - Creighton Tolliver (the usual sweaty Jon Polito) a dodgy entrepreneur searching for $10,000 bucks to enter the dry cleaning business, and Freddy Riedenschneider (the imperious high falutin' Tony Shalhoub) a sharp and arrogant criminal lawyer brought in from Sacramento who looks down his nose at the weedy denizens of Santa Rosa from his table at his luxury restaurant and from the most expensive hotel in town - both bought at his client's expense of course. Both sharks can't wait to skip town as soon as business is done and everyone has been sucked dry.

The boredom is stated most emphatically by Ed Crane, the barber whose bored almost catatonic worldview permeates the whole picture. Billy Bob Thornton stunningly conveys his character's weirdly empty placidity. His voice-over is given in a laconic deadpan drawl, he never smiles, and he barely reacts to anything or anyone. However, as the film progresses this proves to be deceptive. Just like the boring humdrum suburban life of Santa Rosa, underneath the surface lethargy lie violent desires and cravings itching to be expressed. These erupt through taking revenge on Big Dave Brewster for screwing his wife. Ed claims he doesn't care about the infidelity - like Hell he doesn't! Like his namesake Marion Crane (in Hitchcock's Psycho [1960], the first 20 minutes of which represents the last gasp of authentic noir) Ed sees an opportunity to make money. He blackmails Big Dave for $10,000 which he `invests' with Tolliver. Later in the film he learns about his wife's pregnancy from a doctor named Dietrichson (the name of the victim in Double Indemnity) and confesses that he hasn't ""performed the sex act"" with Doris for many years. This casts Ed as another in the series of castrated middle-aged men that goes back to the roles Edward G. Robinson played in two classic Fritz Lang noirs - Richard Wanley in The Woman in the Window (1944) and Chris Cross in Scarlet Street (1945). Aside from a passion for revenge, Ed also craves the company of Birdy and her piano playing. This obsession is underlined by the Beethoven piano sonatas that swamp the soundtrack to determine a mood of repressed sexuality that pervades the entire film. The scene where Ed stands in Birdy's room insisting absolutely that he wants to take her to see a top music teacher in San Francisco en-route to a concert career is the most emotional he gets and the closest he approaches to recovering whatever sexual potency he once had. A man castrated by years of sexless marriage and trapped in a small provincial backwater working in a barber's shop owned by his wife's family, Ed sees his chance to make money, escape the family trap, take revenge on his enemies and promote the girl of his dreams. It's not too hard to imagine these desires encapsulating the same feelings of 1949 audiences, and by re-casting it as a new film in 2001 the Coens are suggesting (probably accurately) that these desires pertain even now for they are basic mythic impulses that transcend time and place. As in all their genre film work, the directors invoke the old to shed light on the new.

The post-war period is caught very impressively by Roger Deakins' gleaming noir photography and because we see everything from Ed's weird perspective, cultural pointers of the time are made to look bizarre even if they are well rooted in fact. This ranges from the expressionistic depiction of Nirdlinger's department store which encapsulates the onset of the consumer boom that would escalate throughout the 50s and the ever-present threat of atomic annihilation (Frank reads in the newspaper about Russian atomic tests), to UFO sightings. Riedenschnieder uses Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (which is said to have influenced Einstein) to state a legal point. Possibly because Ed himself feels so alien to the environment that surrounds him, he is drawn to the possibility of the existence of UFOs. He reads about the Roswell incident in the paper, is visited by Ann Brewster who is convinced she saw her husband being abducted by aliens, experiences a car crash as a flying saucer hallucination and finally dreams about being visited by a UFO. All of this taken with the use of Beethoven may seem unusual in film noir, but there are precedents (atomic threat was dealt with by Robert Aldrich in Kiss Me Deadly [1956] while aliens came to roost in Jacques Tourneau's Cat People [1942]) and the story pans out in traditional noir style without putting a foot wrong. A superb central performance from Thornton leading a cast who are all equally as accomplished, it's an altogether remarkable achievement from the Coens and stands as one of their finest films.

This DVD release is superb with excellent visuals (aspect ratio 16:9) and sound. The extras are generous with an extended (perhaps too extended) 50 minute interview with Roger Deakins, a making of documentary and out-takes. The Coens are irresistible film makers and this film is one to savor. Recommended with enthusiasm.",1418774400,,12172,4.981317600786627

Beautiful, black and white stylish noir complete with luscious drags off of ever-lit cigarettes you either want to start smoking for the first time or light up after a long hiatus.

It's worth making sure your business is complete for the day before settling in for this film--It will allow you to more easily immerse yourself in this world and to consider how a person in a small town could be tried for a crime they didn't commit while still being guilty.

1438066,5,B00005JKMG,"Set in 1950, the Coen brothers' THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE (USA/UK-2001) is a modern film that comes as close to classic noir as any ever made.

Featuring subdued narration by the main character and inventively shadowed cinematography with many unusual angles and forced perspective, this is the story of a town barber (Billy Bob Thornton), a normally quiet man who murders in self-defense when his act of revenge, an anonymous blackmail scheme, goes awry and the victim (James Gandolfini) learns his identity.

A superb cast includes Frances McDormand as Billy Bob's cheating wife, Tony Shaloub playing the high-priced lawyer who is unable to defend her when she's wrongly charged with Gandolfini's murder, Michael Badalucco as the chatty owner of the barbershop where Thornton works, Jon Polito as a dry cleaning scam artist who inadvertantly sets the blackmail in motion by tempting Thornton to invest 10K, and Scarlett Johansson as a teen amateur pianist that Billy Bob unsuccessfully tries to mentor.

They are typically brilliant at capturing a sense of place and time, from Jeffrey Lewbowski's Los Angeles in the 90s to the Depression Era South in O Brother Where Art Thou to our nation's post 9/11 paranoid capitol in Burn After Reading. This time, they've captured a time and a mood with stunning visuals and a Bergmanesque use of light and shadow.

We know that his fate is sealed and we know he will go quietly to take his turn at the ""barber chair"" in the final scene.

1438117,5,B00005JKMG,"Disclaimer: This review is based on a streaming rental, thus I cannot comment on the quality of the picture or the extras included in this package.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Out of all the Coen brothers films that I've seen (and as far as I know I've only missed one), this one ranks either at or next to the top, even though I'm fairly positive it doesn't have the widest appeal.  So, while I believe that it is a five star film for me, its current average of four stars is probably reflective of its general reception.

I can't help but place this film next to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barton-Fink/dp/B00008RH3J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barton Fink</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Serious-Man/dp/B003102JDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Serious Man</a>, and think that all three are attempts to answer the same essential question: a rather angst-ridden variant of 'What sort of man are you?'  Each film examines an isolated man - emotionally and socially cut off from their idea of normal by the absurd whims of life.  And although the characters surrounding them seem to have adapted to these whims, for themselves, the more they bring their reason and experience to bear, the further they become straight-jacketed by their fate.

In `The Man Who Wasn't There', Ed Crane, the barber, blackmails his wife's lover for ten thousand dollars; it's an attempt to finally break out of the nothing of his life and into something.  Because the story is told from a noir-ish perspective, it will conform to certain conventions, but this is simply the package the filmmakers use to showcase an introspective, bewildered man, one who may conceptually understand the motivations and desires of those around him, but who seems congenitally incapable of melting into this same stream of life.  When the blackmail scheme unravels, Ed finds himself further isolated from the society around him, and his wife in prison, falsely accused of murder.  To say anymore might spoil the superficial delights of this engaging mystery - and no matter what messages the director and writer may be trying to pass along, the film still works as an intelligent and entertaining genre film.  But as the drama deepens, the nuanced layers keep surfacing, and by continually asking what sort of man Ed might be, the filmmakers may as well be prodding us to ask ourselves the same question.

The Coen's are known for inserting quirky elements into their films for no other reason than they like putting them in there - this can be annoying or charming, depending on how one looks at those things, but with `The Man Who Wasn't There', _most_ of that is left for the final scenes of the film.  In this case, I _do_ think they take away from the overall effectiveness of the film - still, it's only minor intrusion.

Frances McDormand is excellent as always, and James Gandolfini turns in a nice performance as one of those hail-fellow-well-met people to your face, but a real s.o.b. to your back.  A few Coen regulars are around, most notably Jon Polito in a very good Jon Polito type role, but this film rests purely on the back of Billy Bob Thornton, who I think succeeds admirably.  He's the barber, which in this film, isn't so much a person who cuts hair, but a metaphor for the modern man - and who of us really knows what that means?

Highly recommended, whether you know what sort of person you are or not.  Give us the blu-ray!",1308096000,6,3555,5.068610634648371
1438118,4,B00005JKMG,"The Coens have made a masterpiece. This film has changed the way I look at the Coens and their filmmaking style. This is the only film I know of where the Coens have filmed in black and white, and they have blown it out of the ball park. The movie, with it's mysterious use of shadows, it's constant twists and turns, and it's use of going beyond the average film noir-type of movie is astonishing and artistic. It's like watching a painting being created and the end result just leaves you still starring at it in awe.
Now I'm not the biggest Billy Bob Thornton fan, don't get me wrong, but this is one of those rare movies where I can sit and enjoy his acting ability (even though he doesn't talk, but he narrates the entire movie, which explains every scene, in a good way. Not like when movies overdo the narration, making it like a boring documentary (And then Jim put on his sock, then he put on his shoe, then Jim stood up, etc.), you know.)
But the constant suspense, the wonderful acting from the other actors (including a funny, but irritating (it was intentional) performance by Tony Shalhoub), and the use of outside elements that appear for a second in the movie, but the Coens elaborate on them making the movie a wonderful movie to watch.

1438122,2,B00005JKMG,"The Man Who Wasn't There, 2009 film

The movie starts with an old-fashioned barber pole. It talks about the owner of this barber shop in Santa Rosa California. Tuesday night Bingo? [No TV then.] The table talk tells about the personalities. An employee laughs at her employer's jokes. Ed seems bored with life. Dave talks about business (the Great Depression was ending). A bald man wants a haircut, and talks about ""dry cleaning"" (no shrinkage for wool clothes). A golden opportunity? [Is a barber an ""invisible man"" once he removes his smock?] Can Ed raise the money by typing a letter? Ed's conversation seems odd. Does his continuous smoking offer a clue? [No mention of the price of a haircut.] Dave talks to Ed about a note that asks for $10,000. What will he do? Dave pays off, Ed can invest in the dry cleaning business. [Is there a clue where this is going?] They visit a family gathering for a wedding reception. Doris drinks a lot. [Another clue in self-destructive behavior?] Then Ed gets a phone call from Dave.

David Allen Brewster (note initials) tells Ed what he did to find out the truth. There is a fight, Ed defends himself with a ""war trophy"". [Would a man walk in public without a hat?] ""Marry in haste, repent in leisure""? Later two policemen call on Ed with bad news. Doris was arrested for embezzlement and murder! A local lawyer recommends lawyer Riedenschneider from Sacramento as ""the best"". Doris explains to Ed about the books. Ed talks to Riedenschneider about the case. [Informative?] Dave's widow tells Ed about what happened a year earlier. She suspects some government conspiracy! Riedenschneider talks to the Cranes. Ed tells his story. No proof? Can he find that ""Entrepreneur""? ""The wheels of justice turn slow."" No rush to judgment to avoid errors. Riedenschneider found out about Big Dave's past and what this could mean. Reasonable doubt? An unknown subject? Blackmail?

The trial begins when the judge arrives. The counselors are summoned. The case is dismissed, the jury discharged. Life goes on for Ed, but his home is empty. People avoid him. [Because of bad luck?] Diedrickson, the County Medical Examiner, drops by to chat about Doris. ""Good luck, Crane."" ""Oh yeah, I guess."" [Would a strange man be allowed in the bedroom of a young girl?] The film runs on with scenes of a musical performance. [Just padding to lull the viewer?] Bertie would rather be a veterinarian than a professional pianist! [Is this some kind of an inside joke?] There is a surprise ending that seems to be tacked on for logical completeness. [Would they have women on a murder jury then?]

This movie runs on far too long, the story is at best average. A better director and writer would make a better picture. The names ""Nirdlinger"" and ""Diedrickson"" came from ""Double Indemnity""; parts seem to echo ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (both better movies). A copy of the original is never as good. ""Riedenschneider"" was a name in ""The Asphalt Jungle"". [Asphalt is another name for ""tar macadam"". Aside from the cost, there is no reason for monochrome, the story could just as well be filmed in color (some things never change). Alfred Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" was filmed in Santa Rosa. The buildings in this film could have come from a Hollywood back lot. Others have questioned the anachronisms in this movie. Weren't long cigarettes first introduced back in the late 1950s? If this movie was meant as a parody it wasn't funny enough; if it was meant as a drama, it runs on too long. Why would anyone trust a disreputable stranger with $10,000?

Featuring subdued narration by the main character and inventively shadowed cinematography with many unusual angles and forced perspective, this is the story of a town barber (Billy Bob Thornton), a normally quiet man who murders in self-defense when his act of revenge, an anonymous blackmail scheme, goes awry and the victim (James Gandolfini) learns his identity.

A superb cast includes Frances McDormand as Billy Bob's cheating wife, Tony Shaloub playing the high-priced lawyer who is unable to defend her when she's wrongly charged with Gandolfini's murder, Michael Badalucco as the chatty owner of the barbershop where Thornton works, Jon Polito as a dry cleaning scam artist who inadvertantly sets the blackmail in motion by tempting Thornton to invest 10K, and Scarlett Johansson as a teen amateur pianist that Billy Bob unsuccessfully tries to mentor.

1438157,4,B00005JKMG,"So it was my pick for movie night, and my last selection, the neo-noir The Last Seduction had been a bust with my friend [who didn't find the main character funny, a requirement for enjoyment], and for some reason I found myself renting this, another neo-noir. I had seen this in the theater and liked it, and upon re-viewing, had the happy experience of discovering that it's even better than I remembered.

We open with these nice 3-D titles over a B&W image of a barber pole--the entire movie is B&W by the way, and packed with gorgeous photography by Roger Deakins. Billy Bob Thornton is Ed Crane, barber who ended up in his job because the owner is the brother of his wife. He says he's not really a barber [as a person], he just works there. All of this is delivered in a noir-type voice-over, as we see that Ed moves incredibly slowly, barely ever makes a facial expression, and rarely says anything. One day a guy comes in for a haircut, and talks about a business deal he came in town for that went sour: he was going to receive $10,000 investment to open a dry cleaning business. This is 1949, and dry cleaning is brand new, the wave of the future.

That night Ed thinks about it--his wife Doris, in the bath, asks him to shave her legs, which we'll come back to--and goes over to the guy, Creighton's, hotel room. He says he'll get the money. Creighton loosens his tie and winks at Ed, who asks if that was a pass. Creighton is gay! And it's a little refreshing, as he has no other characteristics we would otherwise associate with a gay person. Anyway, Ed says he'll get the money.

Earlier that night Ed and Doris have had James Gandolfini as Dave over for dinner, and Ed mentioned that he thinks Dave and Doris are having an affair. His plan to get the money is to send a note, seemingly from someone else, threatening to expose the affair. Dave, upset, confides in Ed that he's being blackmailed, but doesn't tell him the woman he's being adulterous with is Doris. He mentions that the news coming out would ruin him, as the department store he runs belongs to his wife's family--so both major male characters work in jobs they are beholden to their wives for. Dave thinks it's ""the pansy"" that sent the note, when Dave refused to give him the money--Dave was the prospect that Creighton had come into town to see. And by the way, Dave's a smart businessman and he thinks Creighton's proposal is a load of hooey.

SPOILERS > > >
Doris gets drunk and is passed out at home when Ed gets a call from Dave. He goes to the store late at night. Dave knows it's him, and asks repeatedly: ""What kind of a man are you?"" He also lets on that he found out it was Ed from Creighton--who he beat for the information. Dave is attacking Ed when, with a quick stab to the neck, Dave is dead. It's a little funny as Ed goes home, sits back in place and resumes the story he was telling when the phone rang earlier.

Surprise--DORIS is hauled off to jail for Dave's murder. Ed gets Doris' brother Frank to mortgage the barber shop to pay for Freddy Reidmenschneider, considered the best lawyer in the region for these kinds of cases. Freddy is played by Tony Shaloub in a flamboyant performance as this self-assured lawyer who talks incessantly and will listen to no one but himself. And also runs up huge bills at others' expense by eating everything in sight and staying at the best hotels. I suspect he was somewhat inspired by Hume Cronyn in the Lana Turner Postman Always Rings Twice, who comes in during the second half and also dominates the film with his self-assurance. Meanwhile, Ed is going over more and more to hear Rachel, the teenage daughter of a friend, play Beethoven. It soothes him and is the only thing he knows that seems beautiful and true.

Certain things start getting weird. Dave's wife comes over and tells Ed that she and Dave both witnessed an alien landing, and experiments were conducted on Dave. She's sure his murder has something to do with a government cover-up. He starts to think about becoming Rachel's manager, and it seems like he has feelings an adult shouldn't be having about a teenage girl. Doris hangs herself in prison before her trial, after learning that Ed knew of her affair and just never said anything. Rachel makes an unrealistic pass, and they have a huge car accident. Ed wakes in prison. They found Creighton at the bottom of a lake--Big Dave killed him--and Ed is blamed for it.

Ed gets Reidmenschneider to defend him, and he makes a big speech about how Ed ""IS"" modern man. Wait--subtext alert sounding! Then Frank punches Ed, causing a mistrial, and shouting again: ""What kind of a man are you?"" Ed gets a crappy lawyer for the mistrial and is sent to death row, where...

We find out that what we've been watching is the dramatization of Ed's story that he's been writing for a men's magazine that is paying him five cents a word--giving him good reason to extend and embellish. We see some men's magazines sitting on his desk, one about an alien landing, one about a married man discovering that he's a mad killer. So the point is we'll never know how much of what we just saw is true, and how much was made up or embellished, as Ed went through and added little bits inspired by the magazines he was reading. This also gives context to the entire movie as a neo-noir, as Ed is writing a pastiche of noir clichs from men's magazines, and the movie itself is a pastiche of clichs and well-worn conventions from noir films. So, it's genius. The problem is, it also kind of invalidates and diminishes the entire movie, because if what we saw was all just a pastiche, just a fantasy, then why should we care about it? It does explain many of the weirder turns the story starts to take in its last third, but it also makes you a bit of a chump for paying close attention to the film, as ultimately none of it mattered. This is too bad, as it can lead one to dismiss and forget much of the truly wonderful performances and photography of the bulk of the film, because ultimately they were all kind of a smokescreen.
< < < SPOILERS END

Nevertheless, really good and really worth watching. Who do the Coen brothers think they are, making a movie as slow, somber and meditative like this? They have a lot of nerve. This has interesting characters, nice observance of noir conventions [without feeling too artificial], good performances and really wonderful photography. It's just a little bit of a shame that the ending, while ideologically brilliant, kind of diminishes the whole 110 minutes that lead up to it. Still, a must see.",1242691200,,6582,4.492063492063492
1438158,1,B00005JKMG,"In the Special Presentations, the Coen Brothers refer to The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity.  I haven't seen all of their films, but this doesn't measure up to Raymond Chandler.  Chandler's stories are more fantasy and fun.  This one should be on the Chill Horror channel.
It's also a remake of Raising Arizona without the fun part.  Not repeating yourself in art is difficult; but with the Coen's status, I guess they can do it if they want.

Can't recommend it.",1236556800,3,426,4.930555555555555
1438160,4,B00005JKMG,"If the title of this 2001 Coen Brothers effort strikes you as vaguely familiar (echoing as it does titles like THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH,  THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE or even, perhaps, THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS),  you'll find much else in the film that hearkens back to earlier eras, most particularly to the film noir works of the `40s and `50s.  The question--as with other efforts by the Brothers--is to what extent is this movie a kind of post-modern  tribute or ""valentine"" to an earlier genre and to what extent is it an actual EXAMPLE of same (tricked out in po-mo sensibility perhaps).
Some will no doubt worry that the film is all style over substance.  Or has style BECOME substance?  I think it's going to shake out differently for different viewers.  I sometimes go to film with friends who are visual artists and have been surprised on occasion by their ""reads"" on films that I felt were ALL style.  Essentially, their take is, ""What's so wrong with that?  It's a visual medium, and can be appreciated on that level alone.""
Well, as a former lit student,  I had (or so I thought) somewhat different criteria: plot, character, setting: all that unities stuff.  For a visual medium like film,  the sheer look of it kind of gets lumped in (vaguely) with setting.  But  over the years,  I've begun to change my tune  or at least to admit to myself that there are plenty of great looking films out there that captivate me by their look, their sound and overall mood.  THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE is certainly one.
All of which is to say is that I personally didn't mind the film's occasional longueurs.  I didn't want Billy Bob Thornton's deadpan character to liven up--even though there are plenty of moments when he could have (moments when his deadened sensibility could conceivably come to life: especially after having actually FOUGHT for his life).  Those possibilities were there and they could have been argued for:  but that's not what the Coens felt was right for the film they were making.  And I would agree with them.
The presence of Frances McDormand in any Coen Brothers film is always welcome (she's always terrific), but I suppose it can have its drawbacks.  Some viewers will be tempted (even more) to compare this film to FARGO, say,  a film in which her character wasn't just quirky,  but also sweet,  smart, down to earth -- and pretty the embodiment of the life force itself.  In this muted film,  she is as commanding a presence as one can hope for.  But that doesn't save her.  And for some, it won't be enough to save the film.  No one gets to bring any sunshine to this beautifully crafted black-and-white film.  In Noirville, actually, that's pretty much as it should be.",1235174400,,2701,4.59958071278826

For direction and photography I believe this film to be among the Coen's top two and much better than Fargo.  But it's okay if nobody rushes out to buy it and it remains unknown.  It leaves something for the rest of us to wonder over, as an underground cult film.",1231891200,,574,4.578431372549019
1438163,2,B00005JKMG,"I was really excited about this movie.  First of all it's a Coen film.  Second of all James Gandolfini is in the film; not to mention Scarlett Johansson and Frances McDormand.  Sure, Billy Bob Thornton is the star, and I like him (don't love him) but the other four selling points were much stronger.  On top of all that it is a film noir, and lately I've been on a real film noir kick.  Sure, I've seen quite a few that have been less than impressive (`Devil in a Blue Dress') but there have been enough good ones to keep my appetite wet.

Sadly, `The Man Who Wasn't There' is not one of them.

The problem with `The Man Who Wasn't There' doesn't really fall in lines of scripting, for I actually felt that the story was really well done.  It doesn't really fall in the lines of acting either, for I felt that as a whole the performances were inspired and helped flesh out the emotional line in the film.  The cinematography is also a highlight, possibly the greatest part of the film.  The lighting is beautiful and captures the mood of the film, that brooding and dark atmosphere.

I love that.

The problem falls in the line of pacing.  Yes, `The Man Who Wasn't There' drags on, or at least feels like it drags on, to the point where I could care less who was there and who wasn't there; I just want it to be over.  I understand that the film noir is supposed to have that repressed feel to it, that slow and gradual revealing of plot points, but this is truly ridiculous.  The film just feels like it's going nowhere, like it's standing still for long drawn out patches of time.  Part of this could be chalked up to Thornton's very lethargic performance, but that's part of the territory and other actors have given the same dreary-eyed portrayal and still held my interest.

No, the problem lies with the films layout; so I guess the Coen's are to blame for that.

The Coen brothers are truly a hit or miss set of directors.  When they hit they hit hard (`Fargo', `No Country for Old Men') but when they miss they miss hard (`Intolerable Cruelty').  `The Man Who Wasn't There' is a miss for me.

As far as the cast is concerned, there are some wonderfully complete performances here that help elevate the film in areas.  Standout to me was, by far, James Gandolfini.  As Big Dave he was brilliantly charismatic and captivating.  Frances McDormand was also a gem, as was Tony Shalhoub.  Scarlett Johansson wasn't in much of the film, but when she was there she was effective.  Thornton has received praise and accolades for his performance, but he bored me stiff.  I don't know if it was his fault, but I can't think of a scene where he commanded my attention.

The script has a lot of potential, and the turn of events with each passing scene is nice to witness, but the melodramatic approach to the film is overused and manages to outweigh the beauty within the premise.  The Coen's are still some of our finest and most imaginative directors working today; but they can't always knock it out of the park.",1220918400,4,3012,4.435336976320583
1438164,5,B00005JKMG,"I loved this film. Billy Bob showed control, almost autistic, but fully aware all the time. Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini added to the outrageous subtle humor, all with a perfect ""noir"" attitude. Scarlett Johannson adds a bit of interest to the proceedings. The Coens never fail to provide an interesting story, and this is as good as it gets. The black 'n white photography is brilliant. I like it a lot.  Very amusing...",1220140800,,431,4.824324324324325
1438165,5,B00005JKMG,"The Man Who Wasn't There takes patience, a slow, dry movie that deftly and almost subtly takes the Coens' two styles (broad comedy and twisty, cause-and-effect crime drama) and blends them into a single piece of filmmaking. Where else are you going to get a pitch-perfect film noir, goofy alien subplots, such darkly ironic twists amongst discussion of dry cleaning and hairstyles?

Billy Bob Thornton inhabits the character of Ed Crane in a way that weighs down on his shoulders, dampens his mood, blanks his face. His ""friend"", Big Dave (James Gandolfini) tries to engage and amuse Ed, but Ed has already realized his wife may be having an affair with Dave. Ed smokes, stares out into the great unknown, and decides to blackmail Dave.

The results of this action are varying and intricate. If you put them side by side, they might look strange and baffling, but in the course of the movie, they make sense. In a movie full of highlights, it's hard to pick just one, but if I had to, I'd name Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shalhoub), a lawyer who talks a lot, mainly to himself. The cinematography is also beautiful -- glorious, evocative black and white that perfectly embodies the film's main character.

The Man Who Wasn't There is an acquired taste. Only after seeing all of The Coen Brothers' movies can I say it is my favorite, because it almost stands outside itself as a comment on their style. It's alive, yet unrealistic, dark yet funny, truthful, yet inescapably cinematic. It's the reason I love the Coen Brothers, and the reason I watch movies.",1215648000,4,1557,4.780669144981412

Not surprising, we have a great film here. It is great because it is in black and white as a matter a fact. Like older films, the B&W brings forth a whole new perspective into this film. Where color would distract, a film in Black and white will show you exactly what needs to be seen. The Coen Brothers and Roger Deakins do a superb job with the black and white film here.

Billy Bob Thorton does a wonderful job with his character here.  In fact, in my mind, he is the film. I have never seen a character like Thorton's character in other films. In this film he is a quiet man. But unlike other films, where we develop an understanding of this quiet man through moral dilemmas, explanations from other characters, in this film Thorton's character remains quiet. We are not later given a monotonous dialog of who this guy really was, he just was and that is all.

1438198,4,B00005JKMG,"So, now I have two great movies (""Ghost World"" and this) and two good movies (""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" and ""Joe Dirt"") for 2001. Although I liked ""Ghost World"" better, on the whole, ""Man Who Wasn't There"" is a great movie, much better than ""Curse of Jade Scorpion,"" which is something I thought I'd never say, not because I thought Woody Allen's movie was so great (face it, he's slipping), but because I could never get into a Coen brothers movie before, despite several attempts.
First of all, I thought Billy Bob Thornton's performance really kept the movie going along. He seems to be the only actor recently come up that understands the importance of subtle shifts in facial gestures and posture to create a mood or to change character. It was like a virtuoso performance, just watching him. He's a sort of ""thinking man's actor,"" like Orson Welles, but without the bombast. I liked him in ""The Apostle,"" but his character was more straightforward in that one. He's got the same thing going in ""Man Who Wasn't there"" that the great method actors, Brando, Clift, Landau and Strasberg had at their peak, which is really weird, because if you look at him in this one, Thornton looks like a cross between Montgomery Clift (after the car crash) and an older Martin Landau.

I loved the lawyer, played by Tony Shalhoub. He's so smooth and polished, and knows how to use words like a stiletto (thanks, Burt Lancaster, for that line). The scene in which Thornton's wife, Doris (played by Frances McDormand) kills herself is a screamer; He has absolutely no remorse over her death except for the fact it denied him an opportunity for courtroom pyrotechnics.

I also loved the references to such movies as ""Double Indemnity"" (though the name of the dept. store, 'Nirdlinger's' comes from the victims name in James M. Cain's book, not the movie, in which Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler changed it to 'Dietrichson,'

1438204,4,B00005JKMG,"Leave it to the Coen Brothers to make Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle the crux of a film noir, and darned if they don't make a good case for it in ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" (Typically, they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who can't even remember Heisenberg's name.) Chain-smoking nebbish barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) makes the only decisive (and dishonest) action of his life, and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several, mostly not-so-innocent, bystanders. In ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" the phrase ""decisive action"" is an oxymoron; everything Crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance. Everything that happens--from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face--changes everything forever, and always for the worse. Set in 1949 in Santa Rosa, Calif. (a tip of the hat to Hitchcock and ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" perhaps?) ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" looks perfect. Like every other Coen film, it's a marvel of production design, and the genius photographer Roger Deakins nails to a tree the dusty black-and-white look of such classic noirs as ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Out of the Past."" Thematically, however, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant, much better acted remake of Edgar G. Ulmer's ""Detour,"" in which the characters drift in a low-rent Sartrean hell, totally the victims of fate. But whereas ""Detour"" is more than the sum of its parts, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is less. The Coen Brothers may believe in chance, but on the screen they leave nothing to chance, so that everything in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is TOO perfect. In the end the film has the same overstudied, clinical quality that afflicts every Coen film except ""Fargo."" (It must be admitted, though, that only one Coen film--""The Hudsucker Proxy""--is ruined by that quality.) The acting is as superb as in any Coen film. Thornton--in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together--burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense, hangdog gravity. There are also glittering supporting performances by Frances McDormand as Thornton's philandering wife Doris; James Gandolfini as her paramour and boss; Jon Polito as a shady businessman; Michael Badalucco as Thornton's motormouth brother-in-law; Scarlett Johansson as the teenager Thornton chastely fancies; and especially Tony Shalhoub, nearly stealing the picture as Freddy Riedenschneider, defense attorney extraordinaire.",1163203200,,2561,5.143884892086331
1438205,4,B00005JKMG,"This is an excellent film. Billy Bob is a clean-vut barber who keeps to himself. His wife married him because she liked that he didn't talk very much. It is a tragedy of epic proportions, with great performances from all involved.

The only thing for me that holds this back from being a FIVE STAR film is the fact that in EVERY SINGLE SCENE someone lights up a cigarette or is taking deep drags on one. That alone justifies this film's ""R"" rating. When watching this film, it seems that they are encouraging people to be ""cool"" and that smoking is a pleasurable thing. The most notorious moment for me is when Frances McDormand is sitting in the bathtub and asks her barber husband (Billy Bob) to shave her legs. He walks in somberly with a cigarette drooping from his lips and she tells him to give her a drag. This is a putrid moment that just drove me crazy! But then, that is just my opinion.

Overall, the film could have been as good and greater if it did not have the incessant smoking throughout. The plot is slow yet intensely emotional. If you don't mind smoking, then you will probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy. If you are as strongly opposed to smoking or have children who are interested in seeing this, you should review the film before letting them see it.",1154908800,,1275,4.467811158798283

I still prefer Fargo but acknowledge that this movie is a special kind of masterpiece.  With few exceptions, I usually do not like films based on unsympathetic characters (one reason I prefer ""Fargo"").  However, this film's exclusive assortment of unlikeable and unprincipled chaqracters creates the perfect springboard for the unintended chain of violent consequences resulting from a opportunistic premeditated act of revenge by a bizzarely laconic barber, all of which are meant to illustrate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  The excellent acting of the cast gives depth to otherwise banal characters in such a way that suggests that they could have been different has they chosen otherwise.  I didn't particularly like the convenient and superfluous inclusion of UFOs in the storyline and thought it unnecessarily weakend an almost flawless plot line.

When an opportunity opens up involving dry cleaning, Ed decides to try to control over his destiny and ends up being punished for this, in the finest film noir tradition.

As usual from the Coens, this is a darkly comic, cleverly plotted noir, but the unusual for the Coens (aside from the voice-over narration and the gorgeous black and white cinematography) is the depth of feeling in this movie. Although a cipher to everyone around him, Ed is, to the viewer, a decent guy who simply doesn't belong in his life. It's impossible not to feel empathy for this guy. This entire movie bears his essence, from the methodical, deliberate plotting to the smoky, restrained black and white. The Coens have really thought this one through, and the result is marvelous.

1438242,5,B00005JKMG,"This review is for the 2002 Universal DVD.

The story is set in the late 1940's, where a small town barber named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) concocts a slick blackmail scheme targeting his cheating wife Doris (Frances McDormand) and her boss 'Big Dave' Brewster (James Gandolfini).  After the payoff, Big Dave figures out that Ed set him up and a violent fight ensues where one of them is murdered.  The cops arrest of the wrong person and a big city lawyer named Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Schalhoub) is hired to defend the accused.  This sets up the rest of the film for plenty of unexpected twists and turns along with a lot of subtle comedy.

The Coen Brothers now have a long resum of wonderful films and this by far my personal favorite since there are many things that work brilliantly in this movie.  First, the black and white cinematography strikingly captures the mood and feel of a late 1940's film.  Second, the deadpan narration and stoic body language by Billy Bob Thorton is mesmerizing.  Third, the attention to detail of the props, decorating and fashion styles is done to perfection.  Fourth, the plot is slick and original.  Finally, the comedy is as dark as the dead of night, but works magically in this bizarre and macabre atmosphere.  I enthusiastically recommend this film - especially if you enjoy old film-noir flicks.

The DVD widescreen black & white presentation is superb, as it should be, since the movie was shot in 2001.  There are many bonus features including commentary by the director Joel Coen and actor Billy Bob Thorton.

1438243,5,B00005JKMG,"The Man Who Wasn't There is a movie by the always unpredictable Coen brothers. Their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it's fun to see what they've come up with next. Out of the ones I've seen, my thoughts are mixed. I mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like Raising Arizona, then one of the best movies of all time with Fargo and then go terribly wrong from there? Then you've got the Big Lebowski, a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness. Not what I call a good movie. Then there's the Ladykillers, a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything. So they're just getting worse by age, right? Wait! Let's go back two years to 2001.

It was in this year that this unheard of movie was made. Of course, its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle. And that's the beauty of this gem. The cinematography. The look of this world and the 1940s feel it's good is brilliant. But it's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own. It is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others. But first, let's talk about the plot of the movie.

Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) is living in California in the 40s with his wife, Doris (Frances McDormand). Doris is part of a community that talks and talks. But not Ed. Ed narrates this story...his story. He sees it in black and white or maybe that's the way it really is. You've got to think. Ed is a barber and is proud of his job. He only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration. So here, there is some more originality, brilliance and beauty. When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini), he reacts with harshness. He blackmails Big Dave but something goes wrong. Big Dave finds out and Ed kills him out of defense. And this all happens in the first 30 minutes. Doris is accused of doing it and from then on, you're in for a real treat.

When Ed isn't narrating, like I already said, he isn't talking. So what he does is smoke, cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed Birdy (Scarlett Johansson) play piano. Her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty.

Tony Shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider. He's a big shot who talks and talks. Keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the ""you don't know"" repeated a bunch of times. Believe me, you'll know when you're hearing it.

The movie is a sad and tragic tale, a tale showing how badly one man's life can go in a world that isn't for him. He's different. It's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one...he stands out because he's different.

The Man Who Wasn't There is hands down an excellent movie. It is a close second to Fargo in the Coen's movies.

My last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves. This movie is rated R for a scene of violence? Is that a joke? That scene was in black and white and showed NOTHING! You people really have no idea what you're doing. Pulp Fiction (R)=The Man Who Wasn't There (R) Get it straight people, your ratings are horrid. James Bond flicks have worse content than this.",1133481600,,3288,4.310679611650485

1438245,3,B00005JKMG,"Weak by Coen Brothers standards still means considerably better than average. It has great technical moments like the sequence where Thornton fills the screen in a contemplative pose as his voice-over plays over a Beethoven piano solo. After a few seconds the camera pulls back and you see Johansson playing the piano in the foreground.

Apparently this was shot on color film and desaturated in post-production because the shadows and contrasts are not really up to film noir standards.

The script is not particularly clever and the Coen's rely on two gimmicks to make it more interesting; the irony of the criss cross as the two men are credited with each other's crime and the barber's basic invisibility to everyone (which makes him the title character-""The Man Who Wasn't There"").

Unfortunately the desire to wring the last ounce of irony out of the story is responsible for a cobbled on final ten minutes. This is totally lame and extends the movie beyond the car accident, a better ending that actually made for better irony. They should have gone out on the spinning hubcap.

This work became not only one of the best films of this year, but it was considered almost automatically a cult movie, and constituted the best entry of the Film Noir genre since Road to Perdition.

Plenty of singular details, with a prodigious camera handle, magnificent photography, a splendid cast, and an increasing suspense script, this artwork focuses around the minuscule world of an insignificant man, a barber who is cheated twice; in his personal honor and financially. Both failures are extremely linked and will work out as wrenches  and existential crossroad that will wait for him at the end of the road.

He is a quite introspective man a misogyny who watches the world go round. His decisions and life project are clearly determined by others, so he is simply a leaf beaten by the wind an instrument of his extremely closed social circle.

It's convenient to remark the presence of an invisible character: Beethoven's piano music. In this sense every time Scarlet plays the piano, there is a allusive and clear reference between Patetique, Appassionata, Moonlight and The Sonata No. 32 that underline , (specially this late one who accents the dissolution final process of Ed Crane) and besides the intimate mood of our main character. So beware, if you are not yet familiarized with the spirit of every one of these works, you can loose important suggestive clues.

Billy Bob Thornton makes an impressive performance as well as Frances Mac Dormand, the consented actress of Coen Brothers - Blood simple and Fargo - .

I recommend specially this work, because to my mind it has been absolutely neglected by the critics and the great audiences.

The pacing of the movie was painfully slow and the dialogue was uninspired, which is highly disappointing coming from the Coens. Alot of acting talent, such as Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, Tony Shaloub and James Gandolfini, went to waste in this picture. The tone of the film was flat and subdued. This is the weakest of the Coen brothers films.",1118966400,7,723,4.700787401574803
1438278,4,B00005JKMG,"From the first glimpse of the main character's barbershop, this film takes off with the complexity of Beethoven's Pathetique, which is featured heavily throughout.  This is a period piece with a plot that encircles and expands over the course of every passing five minute segment.  I was surprised repeatedly, and can honestly say that I was not fully certain as to how it would end until the credits rolled.

Overall, the acting is superb.  Shalhoub is just as exquisite in his role as defense attorney as he was playing the producer in Barton Fink.  His ""Uncertainty Principle"" defense is hilarious and frighteningly believable as a method in which lawyers occasionally cleanse their clients of guilt. Billy Bob Thornton's performance appears effortless as he manages to be disengaged and endearing at the same time. Gandolfini is good as Big Dave, although the character is not far removed from the one that made him famous, Tony Soprano.

This is yet another magnificent effort from the Coen brothers.  They have repaid fans like me countless times in the past for our interest and they do not disappoint here.  Nobody produces better film noir or challenges their viewers intellectually like the fraternal duo.",1117324800,2,1215,5.0703517587939695

As usual the script, directing and acting are fantastic. Billy Bob Thornton was very good at playing Ed Crane, the barber who decided to end his boring life and try something new only to end up in disaster. As in the other Coens movies there are so many twists and turns that they will make your head spin and this one is no different. Recommended for fans of film noir, the Coens brothers, and independent film. My rating 9/10.",1116374400,,641,4.440677966101695
1438280,5,B00005JKMG,"I was unable to find a theater to show The Man Who Wasn't There film in 2001 when it came out. So I had to be satisfied with watching a VHS copy of it some six months after it appeared in theaters.

I should point out how fitting it is that the film has disappeared even from Video store shelves where I live. Fitting, because this is a story about the Man Who Wasn't There. For many Coen Brothers fans, The Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona are the great films. For them, the Man Who Never Was doesn't exist.

This overlooked gem IS one of the great Coen Brothers films. I had to put it in my Netflix queue to get a copy. There wasn't one available locally just a year after the video came out.

Lately I've been making DVD copies of favorite films. The Coens' distributors at USA films actually took the trouble to encrypt this one with Macrovision. Not that macrovision stops one. There are free programs on the net like DVD Decrypt and DVD Shrink to dispense with copying problems. It costs money to encrypt a tape or DVD, though; makes it difficult to make back your costs. Since this film is quietly disappearing anyway, distributors might just as well have skipped coding.

After making the copy I sat down and watched it with the sound off and the captioning on and realized how much detail I missed four years ago when I first looked at the film. I 'read' the film this time.

Billy Bob is a local barber. He is overshadowed by everyone., his wife, the local department store manager played by James Ghandofini, even by the chatterbox lead barber he works for at the shop. Crane, our hero's name, explains his story mostly in Noir voice over. Crane's wife married him because he keeps his mouth shut. The result is the two know little about one another. Man Who Wasn't There is peopled by some very forgettable folk. There's a sense of small town failure here. Everyone knows everyone in Santa Rosa, but who'd want to know any of them? A con man comes to town setting the plot in motion. Behind the small town verities, there is a Noir story dripping with deceit and personal despair. In a scene near the end, Crane is driving down a country road with a young girl. The scene reminds one of a similar scene in Cain's Postman and also of Bogey talking to the girl whose gimp leg he is trying to get fixed in Raoul Walsh's High Sierra. This film really rattles a filmophile's memory.

I noticed all the references: A Place in the Sun, James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, assorted Twilight Zone images from the Rod Serling teleplays that took place at night in suburban neighborhoods. Santa Rosa reminded me of the fictional Santa Mara of Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Hitchcock and Rod Serling both put their marks on the Coens. I understand Shadow of A Doubt was also set in the bland small town of Santa Rosa, outside Sacramento. Shadow is a great metaphor. There were always waving tree shadows flitting over Billy Bob Thornton's Wan Face in the night air.

Looking at the film in closed caption, I was struck by how misled I was mostly just watching the images and listening to the dialog when I first saw the film. The devil was in the details. I now know the whole story as I did not before when I took in the film, consumer style.

Anyway, its a bit of a disappearing act, isn't it, this film? I keep forgetting its correct name. The Public never noticed in the first place. McDormand, Ghandofini, Billy Bob, the Coens are all part of the disappearing Man Who Never Was.

Maybe that was the point.",1114992000,2,3537,4.445987654320987
1438281,5,B00005JKMG,"In my mind, there are two filmmakers currently working who consistently make good/great, intelligent films in a variety of genres that are always of the highest quality. One of those people is Steven Soderbergh. From his first film, a little independent film about modern relationships called ""sex, lies & videotape"" to a film about a boy during the depression in Kansas City, ""King of The Hill"" (one of the most underrated films ever) to ""The Limey"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"", each film has raised the bar on his own ability further revealing his ability as a filmmaker. The other is the Coen Brothers. The Coen Brothers have primarily concentrated on comedies, often the hardest genre to pull off, but their comedies have ranged wildly in tone and pitch. They have also created some of the most memorable dramas of the last few decades. I would put forth that no other filmmaker, working consistently, has created such a diverse, technically superior library of films since Billy Wilder. Their first film, ""Blood Simple"" was a great evocation of the classic film noir, filmed in color, set in Texas. It took the genre to new heights. They followed this film with ""Raising Arizona"", a brilliant updating of the screwball comedy, ""Miller's Crossing"", a great gangster film set in the 30s (also one of the most overlooked films ever), ""Fargo"", a comedy- mystery with a pregnant cop as the hero, ""The Big Lebowski"", a completely different comedy from their other efforts and ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", a great mix of mythology, blue grass music and 30s prison films. Both Soderbergh and the Coen Brothers have consistently improved their skills and storytelling mastery, a scary prospect when they both started at such a high level.

The Coen Brothers are different from Soderbergh in that some of their films take a while to sink in, for the viewer to recognize the eccentricities of the film. ""The Big Lebowski"" was like this for me. Only on the third screening, did I begin to appreciate it. Most of their films have earned cult status and fans of their films repeatedly watch them.

Another aspect of their films that is very consistent is the level of technical expertise. Working with people on a number of projects, they have clearly formed working relationships with these key people that serve to enhance each film. Each of their films is a tribute to a certain genre or type of filmmaking. When you watch a Coen Brothers film it is very easy to see what they are trying to pay homage to because they usually get every detail right. ""Miller's Crossing"" captured the world of 30s gangsters in such a way that I believed Gabriel Byrne's character was a mobster. ""Blood Simple"" was an early evocation of Noir that used color as the classic Noir's used shadow. ""Raising Arizona"" is simply one of the best screwball comedies to be made in a long time. Everything is off-kilter and out-of-whack. ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" used shades of sepia and yellow to give the film an old, weathered look, much like an old hymnal. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" continues this trend of technical excellence.

Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a barber in a small shop in Santa Rosa, California. He is the second chair in a shop owned by his brother-in-law, Frank (Michael Badalucco). Frank talks and talks and talks causing Ed to further tune out a life he isn't happy with. His wife, Doris (Frances McDormand) is the accountant at Nirdlinger's Department Store and works for Big Dave (James Gandolfini). Ed suspects that Doris and Big Dave are having an affair but doesn't really have a reason to do anything about it. Until he is presented with a business opportunity. Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) gets a haircut and talks about his business idea. Dry Cleaning. He has the idea; he just needs the capital. He just needs $10,000. His former investor backed out leaving him holding the bag. Ed now has a reason to do something about the affair.

Joel and Ethan Cohen have created a modern masterpiece of film Noir. Filmed in color (at the insistence of the studio), but processed in black and white, the film's look is lush, rich, shadowy and simply perfect. Evocative of such Noir classics as ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and ""Double Indemnity"", the film evokes the late 40s in a small town down to the smallest detail. Joel and Ethan write their films and Ethan produces them while Joel directs. From the moment we watch the beginning credits cast a shadow on a barber pole, we realize we are in for a treat.

They have created a series of characters that combine all of the best elements of the Noir film and have added a dose of black humor. Ed Crane is your typical Noir anti-hero. Unhappy with his life, Crane almost never smiles and almost always has a cigarette in his mouth. His perfect hair cut and dour clothes are evocative of how serious he takes his job and how depressed he is with his life. The fact that he doesn't get mad at Doris when he realizes he is having an affair is also perfect for the character. Doris, as played by Frances McDormand, is also perfect. Quiet, in a way, but pushy also, she is clearly more interested in other pursuits than her marriage. Gandolfini is also great as Big Dave, a character reminiscent of many Noir characters. As the Coen Brothers have created a sort of tribute, each character embodies many elements of famous characters from other films, but they are played more realistically than they might have during the 40s and 50s. Each of the characters is funny, but also has a little touch of reality. Tony Shalhoub is very memorable as the slick lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider. Richard Jenkins steals his few scenes as a local lawyer by the name of Walter Abundas. Scarlett Johansson plays Birdy Abundas, a local piano prodigy.

The cinematography by Roger Deakins (who has worked on a few Coen Brothers' films) is outstanding. Always conceived as a black and white film, USA Films reportedly insisted that the film be shot on color film for foreign territories. The prints in the US will be black and white and we are luckier for it. The film has a lush quality that comes from the era, but it also comes from the shadows and the attention to detail. The Crane's house is filled with shadows that ripple and move providing a sort of prison for their feelings and emotions. When Ed visits Nirdlinger's at night, the department store takes on a completely menacing look as he walks through the shadowy, mannequin filled interior. A scene in a prison interrogation room is simply beautiful as Shalhoub's character walks back and forth in a blinding ray of light, the light broken by the bars of the small round window. This is a film that a film student or aficionado will love.

The score by Carter Burwell (also a frequent Coen Brother's collaborator) uses selections from classical piano, played on one piano, to set the right mood. Tied into the story, the single finger plucking at the Beethoven helps to create an air that is, at times, lush and musical, and other times menacing.

As the story progresses, the comedy becomes more infrequent as the Noir and drama elements take over. This doesn't mean that the strange characters and situations, trademarks of a Coen Brothers' film, are abandoned. When one of the characters gets into a car wreck, we hear a bit of voiceover over a shot of a field, then a hubcap comes sailing into the frame which morphs into something else, which is further tied into the film at a later point. Two cops show up who seem to have a problem communicating with their suspects and what they have to say. All of these different elements help to create a very rich film that will amuse the viewer. It will also require repeat viewings to pick up all of the details.

""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is a film that I will definitely see again, not because I didn't get certain elements, but because I loved it so much and want to experience it on the big screen before I buy the DVD (which will hopefully be loaded with extras).",1113350400,4,7998,4.6908831908831905

THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. Billy Bob Thornton sets the mood for

his character Ed Crain perfectly right from the start, with the

line, ""Me, I don't talk much, I just cut the hair"", delivered

with the low key, emotionless style of a man who could just as

biggest turning point of his life. This style works in perfect

1438283,2,B00005JKMG,"Yes, this film contains some fine acting and some clever reproductions of the ""film noir"" genre from the late 1940s.  But the script leaves a lot to be desired, and the directing is at times extraordinarily inadequate. How many times do we need the same shot of a man smoking, staring into the distance, and mumbling a few words of no consequence?  The plot has a few twists that are unpredictable, but it's hard to follow, given the poor script.  I can imagine that film studies types will find much to cluck about here.  I was reminded of the many Ingmar Bergman movies I used to sit through in the 1950s, thinking them quite profound.  Having grown up, I realize that they are a bore.  This Coen brothers production is more boring than most.  Two stars.  One of the least of their works.",1095552000,8,790,4.475524475524476

Great camera angles, intense shadows and wonderful shades of white/gray/black make ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" really something to look at. However, actors Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini, all have done better work before in other films. You'll find a little bit of intrigue and mystery... but the pace is incredibly slow, and outside of Gandolfini's character being stabbed in the neck, not much happens. The film is all dialogue (and it's none of that trademark witty Coen dialogue we've come to love and expect). The story line is weak and for the most part dull. Thornton's dead-pan monotone delivery of his lines and narration were tedious to get through. I've come to expect so much more from the Coen brothers - they are truly gifted in their medium. With classics to their credit like ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", ""Miller's Crossing"", etc...

1438285,5,B00005JKMG,"""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is a great film release from 2001, starring Billy Bob Thorton, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, and James Gandolfini.  The Joel and Ethan Coen, the Oscar winning writers of ""Fargo"", prove that their creative minds express great and original entertainment.  This gloomy themed movie keeps audiences interested in every scene, besides the black and white scenery.  The plot of a barber who begins illegal dry cleaning, then becomes blackmailed, is brilliant.  Its combination of mystery, drama, and suspense blends perfectly.  The special effects, namely the UFO, add more interesting entertainment value.  As the series of events unfold, the timely theme builds, leading to a surprising conclusion.  Such movie quality offers a great unforgettable film experience.  Billy Bob Thorton beautifully acts his role of Ed Gayne, the barber.  Gayne's hard times are expressed greatly, which proves more difficult to accomplish because he doesn't speak often.  His narration throughout the film offers another sense of mystery and gloomy effect.  Frances McDormand's role as Gayne's wife is performed at her top throughout the film, expressing every emotion accurately.  Scarlett Johansson proves that she is one of the few child stars with actual acting talent (she was 16).  All other actors also perform their roles greatly.

1438286,5,B00005JKMG,"This is a movie that sneaks up on you as you watch it. Like all Coen brothers movies, on the surface it is a story about a relatively small lie that mushrooms out of control, but this film goes deeper than the simple morality tales many Coen brothers films are at heart. This is the study of a man who has become detached from society, and who becomes more detached as the film goes on. Its pace is deliberate and the film intentionally lacks any sort of dynamic range in tone, but stick with it - it's beautiful to look at (this is real cinematography - the play of light and composition on display in every frame), and if you can hold your attention to the end you will likely find the film a profound experience. Sad in a thoughtful way, the film does not manipulate you into tears and is at the end life affirming in an intangible way that's difficult to explain. Highly reccomended!",1082073600,,887,4.349397590361446
1438326,4,B00005JKMG,"The Coen brothers have the reputation of being excellent, if not a bit quirky, filmmakers. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" continues with this reputation. This film, at all once, parodies and worships the film noir genre. The main character, Ed Crane, is a barber in a small Californian town where everyone lives under the guise of perfection: A sort of Western Levittown.
Crane (played by Billy Bob Thorton) speaks slowly, without varied emotion, while narrarating this film.  The premise of the plot is Crane's attempt to ""go in on"" a dry cleaning business with a rather seedy passing-through businessman. When the business man is found dead, Crane is the primary suspect. Crane's wife is having an affair with her boss. When Crane eventually confronts him, he (Crane) also winds up killing him. In the typical noir style, there is a vague detachment of the protagonist from his surroundings: Regardless of what events may come forth, Crane's voice and disposition do not change the slightest.
Probably the biggest downfall of ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is the ending. It almost seems that the Coen brothers aren't satisfied with having created a strong film, and therefore they felt obligated to tinker with the ending. Unfortunately, this does not work. The ending leaves something to be desired: It does a poor job of ending the film, and mismatches the previous parts of the film (ie, like pairing plaid shirts and striped pants). The ending itself wasn't bad, it was simply that it deviated so much from the film's style that it essentially wrecked the ending of the film.
While I do not believe this to be one of the Coen brother's strongest films, it must still be viewed. It is a relatively large deviation from many of their movies (that is, the typical dark humor). There must be artistic kudos given to them, as they have again demonstrated that they may adroitly expand into other ""genres"" of film, without ever entirely abandoning their style.",1080086400,,1953,4.900302114803625
1438327,2,B00005JKMG,"I thought O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? was the low point of the Coen Brothers' otherwise remarkably fine body of work, but THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE proves me wrong.  This is like a film-school exercise, a demonstration of cleverness in reconstructing a post-war noir and pushing all the elements to extremes.  It's so self-consciously stylish and tongue-in-cheek as to utterly defy suspension of disbelief, but seems to take itself too seriously to succeed as a spoof.  It's somewhat amusing intellectually, on the meta- level, to see the Coens play with the genre's conventions, but hardly funny enough to justify the 2 hour running time.  The gag wears thin long before it's over.
Many of the individual scenes and shots brilliantly reference the noir style, with striking high-contrast blacks and whites dominating the frame.  And several performances are sufficiently entertaining to repay the time spent watching--especially Tony Shaloub, outstanding as always, playing the fast-talking defense attorney from Sacramento.  Richard Jenkins's slightly saturated home-town lawyer is a small treasure.  Adam Alexi-Malle makes a splendidly self-impressed piano teacher, and Frances McDormand has several strong scenes, most notably when congratulating the bride at a wedding in Modesto.  And Billy Bob Thornton does an admirable job of playing an expressionless one-note character (maybe he should have gotten an Oscar, like Dustin Hoffman got for RAINMAN), but--like the story itself--that wears thin awfully fast.
Stylish? Yes. Skilful? You bet.  But in the end far from satisfying--as one ought expect from a movie about a gimmicky idea instead of a story about characters we can care about.  Sure, the Coens' work is always idea based--RAISING ARIZONA, FARGO, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, for instance--but their success in turning an idea into interesting entertainment has always depended on characters the viewer can identify with.  Otherwise, no matter how clever the movie, the bottom line will always be ""Who cares?""",1078272000,3,2011,5.45483870967742
1438328,4,B00005JKMG,"A friend of mine who is a serious fan of the Coen brothers loaned me this film recently and I loved it.  It really goes out to give you that 1940's film noir feel and it succeeds masterfully.  The Coens have shown us their range before, giving us a film like Raising Arizona, one of the funniest movies of all time, and then a movie like Fargo, which had some in your face shock moments you will never forget.
Now we have Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), a barber who puts more cigarattes into his mouth in the film than speaks words out of it.  He is the second chair in the barbershop and he ""just keeps cutting the hair"".  One day, he has a customer who has the newest phenomenon for America, dry cleaning.  He has done all the research, just needs some start up capital to get going.  Thornton knows just how to get the money, and decides to go in with the stranger.
This sets off the events seen during the rest of the film, including blackmail, murder, courtroom trials, and a strange fascination with the musical talents of a young teenage girl.  Through it all, Thornton seems more like an observer of life than willing to take control of things.  His wife, (Francis McDormand) is a burn out who doesn't really love him and his friend, Dave (James Gandolfini) may not be as good a friend as he thinks.  Crane doesn't seem to give a rip regardless of the situation.  It's one of the most interesting characters we've seen recently.  Thornton was a perfect choice for the role.
In the end, this is not a happy movie.  Not by any means.  But unlike depressing films like Leaving Las Vegas, we are not dragged down into the abyss.  Maybe that's because we have learned to look at life like Ed Crane, just keep plodding along.",1077062400,2,1727,4.389937106918239
1438329,5,B00005JKMG,"I normally wind up with mixed emotions when it comes to films from the Coen brothers but I think they've got all their tricks in line with this one.
  Those in the know with classic literature will easily notice that the ""Man who wasn't..."" is based on Camus' famed book ""The stranger"". The equations between this great book and the film are well balanced: the book is provoking and so is the film.

  The plot is about a barber working in a small town. His life has all the tell-tale signs of a ""nobody-special"" man like him: his job isn't taking him anywhere, his marriage is a flat and boring non-relationship, his wife is double-timing him with one of his ""friends"", and he himself, well he doesn't seem to bother much about all that, or actually he doesn't seem to care about anything.
  Life drags dully on, until the arrival of someone who tells the barber of his plan to hit the market with a new revolutionary business plan: dry cleaning. The whole scheme sounds attractive and has money-making potential written all over it but the missing element is the capital. The barber's mind goes on an interesting vortex of planning. He blackmails his well-off friend who has the affair with his wife for a nice bulky sum. That seems to work, the money is given, and then given on to the dry-cleaning guy and then, well, perhaps predictably, the wheels of the wagon start coming off in disturbing and untimely manner.

  Without fully realising how it all happened, the barber winds up in a plot which involves a murder he commited, his wife in jail accused for it, the dry-cleaning guy gone with the dough, him looking for a good lawyer to save his wrongly accused wife, and in the midst of it all, he still seems to deal with this nicely unraveling disaster very apathetically.
  But his apathy isn't rewarded much as thing keep becoming more intricate and more threatening.
  Just as it had been with his wife, he tries to start a relationship in extremely platonic terms with another young woman, but alas, that comes to spell his ultimate doom. No need to reveal the cool bringing-it-all together ending of the film especially for those that haven't seen the film.
  But besides a great story line, ""The man who wasn't..."" is blessed with other assets too, mainly the stellar performances from Thortnton himself who gives apathy a new look, and F.Mcdormand who (as usual) is exemplary in her role. But also the usually underrated J.Gandolfini is great as are all the second characters as well.
  The Coen bros. do wonders with the camera, the lights and the reenacting of the 30s atmosphere making this an unheralded masterpiece.
  While the film is actually a take on the philosophy about life, or to be more specific, an approach that reads ""who cares really, let it all unwind and see what happens"", it will go down easily with mostly anybody. The characters portrayed here are as real-life as they come and the depiction of the basic faults (?) of human nature is given to perfection.
  Greed, scheming, extreme selfishness, hypocrisy, and all the things that are products of the above come in display. And in the end as the ""hero"" from the barber shop sees it all collapse in smouldering flames he thinks: ""maybe all this means that I'm going to a better place. Who's to say""..And that's the thing really: who's to say?

1438330,4,B00005JKMG,"Ostensibly like Albert Camus' book called ""The Stranger"", this movie is basically an unfurling retrospective of an ordinary barber's life. There really is no other way to describe this quaint offering from the Coens.
Depending on whom you ask, the attempted film noir could be about several of the many themes that it broaches: simplicity of small town life, fidelity, friendship, entrepreunerism (the barber has a perpetual but unfulfilled wish to get into the dry cleaning business that was apparently the hot thing back then in 1930s), about the ""what does around comes around"" (the barber pays for what he has done), pursuing your dreams (encouraging a young girl to take up piano as a career). At one point, I also felt the Coens would go down the ""Lolita"" road, and hinted at it with a driving scene, but an accident pretty much killed that possibility. Above all, in a somewhat bizarre twist, we also have UFOs thrown in.
If all this is too heavy for you, there's a hint of humor in between these deep crevices. The barber's lawyer is almost a caricature of the legal profession.
But ultimately, the movie is a scattershot rambling of a man about his life gone awry. Somewhat like an ""About Schmidt"", just less hopeless and more definitive in its conclusion. Bob Thornton is as convincing as he was in ""Monsters Ball"". Come to think of it, the three movies have a similar relaxed pacing.
On a positive note, the movie has an atmospheric story-telling feel to it. If, like with poetry, you don't necessarily NEED a movie to be about something SPECIFIC, this movie may be well worth a ride.

Billy Bob Thornton and Frances McDormand are perfectly matched, neither outperforming the other, and the supporting actors are equally good.

The film is a murder mystery, the mystery lying not in who committed the murder, which the viewer witnesses, but in how the various repercussions will play out. Although there is a good deal of violence, it is appropriate, and because of the surreal nature of the story, does not offend. The classical music soundtrack also softens its impact.

1438388,5,B00005JKMG,"I had never heard of this 2001.  And yet it won a academy award for its cinematography and was nominated for several others.  It's not the kind of film that gets big box office receipts.  It's a small character-driven film that goes deeply beneath the surface.  And the kind of film that actors are proud to have worked in.
Written and directed by the Coen Brothers, it's set in small town in 1949 and photographed in black and white. Billy Bob Thornton works as a local barber.  He's a quiet man who is content to just do his job.  He's married to Frances McDormand, who's wears lots of makeup and drinks hard.  She's employed as a bookkeeper in the local department store that is rapidly expanding.  Her boss is a loud-mouthed braggart, played by James Gandolfini, with whom she is having an affair.  Billy Bob is aware of this.
In an attempt to raise money to go into business for himself, he has a plan. It involves blackmail.  But it soon turns to murder.  The wrong person is accused.  There's a tragedy.  And the plot keeps thickening.  Another fine actor, Tony Shalhoub, is called in to act as a defense lawyer.  More complications ensure.  The central character, Billy Bob Thornton, keeps getting wrapped more tightly in a web of his own making.  Throughout it all, he keeps is quiet stoic personality.  He's ""every man"" who's ever had a dream and see spin out of control.  His dialog is always simple, and yet it is always meaningful.  The audience gets to know him on an interior level and it is rare that I've seen such deep character development in a film.  This was a film where the slow pace was intentional because it was part of the story.  I found it a fine drama and became completely involved in it.
As an added feature on the DVD, there was a long interview with Roger Deakins, who did the cinematography.  I learned a lot about the technical aspects of the shooting as well as the choices for some unique and original shots.  For example, during a prison scene there is harsh sunlight shining through the bars and washing out the face of the lawyer.  He uses silhouettes a lot of dark and light contrasts which all added to the mood of the film.
This was a fine and thoughtful film.  I give it one of my highest recommendations.",1048809600,4,2250,4.480295566502463
1438389,5,B00005JKMG,"This is actually one of very few movies that I purchased PRIOR to ever seeing it.  I had good feelings about it.  My feelings were right.
This is a wonderful movie about a barber ""Ed Crane"" (Billy Bob) who lives a very quiet, mediocre life with his wife with whom he has a very shallow relationship.  But that's only the beginning.  There is so much more depth to Ed Crane and his life that is slowly revealed throughout the movie.
Ed Crane doesn't say much.  He doesn't have to.  It's obvious his life is less than perfect.  Anyway, in the movie Ed Crane is almost invisible.  I don't want to give too much away ... you need to see it for yourself.  I will say that the movie is very deep and touching ... you won't forget it.  Who would suspect the barber...  He just cuts the hair.  Crane's nonchalant attitude throughout the movie was intriguing to say the least.  And the ending is unexpected.  But then again, everything in the movie is.  It's a mystery ... it's a drama.  A dramery.  I just made it up.  It works.
The *New* black and white, film noir-look of the movie is very cool.  They should make more movies that way (film it in color and then change it to black and white).  It really made the movie better, I thought.  It's definitely hard NOT to watch this movie.  It keeps you glued to the screen wondering what will happen next.  It's NOT predictable.  That's part of it's charm.  This was just a very surprising movie in general.  I highly recommend it.  I don't regret buying it at all.  ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is different ... in a good way.  I wish more movies were like this one.
A movie I suggest if you like this one (w/ great character development):  ABOUT SCHMIDT.",1046649600,6,1694,4.336538461538462
1438390,5,B00005JKMG,"The Coen's did it again. They are about the only filmmakers today who manage to make great movies aside from Hollywood mainstream. ""The man who wasn't there"" is a great black and white film, 50s style. The acting is terrific, the story is magnificent and the whole thing is just a great film to watch. Such a quiet and deep cinema experience. Film lovers should get this. I was surprised how interesting the movie is and about the ending. Totally nice. After Big Lebowski, O Brother... and Fargo, this is surely one of their best Films.
The DVD is great as well. Although it lacks English subtitles (what dvd producer had that idea?), it has great features. There is a very interesting audio commentary, a good almost hour-long interview with DEakins, some deleted scenes and other stuff. The audio and picture quality is top-notch.
Great. That's how you make a film",1045267200,5,866,4.741721854304636
1438391,5,B00005JKMG,"Have the Cohen brothers ever made a bad film? Never. Each and every one of their films is outstanding and each of the them have somethign new to offer. ""The Man Who Wasent There"" is pure Film Noir. I cannot imagine seeing this film in color...black and white is the way to go!
Billy Bob is brilliant in this film. He has very few scene specific dialogues, majority of his lines are narrative. Frances McDormand, who plays Billy Bob's wife, also gives a memorable performance. Contradictory to Billy Bob's charactor, who is a lonesome serious man who seems content with letting life pass right by him, McDormand is this sultry schemestress who under bizzarr circumstances gets caught up in dangerous circumstances. James Gandolfini, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Badalucco, Jon Polito and Scarlett Johansson play their parts to perfection as supporting actors.
The plot of this film is not too complex but has great philosophycal depth to it. The story revolves around themes like revenge and bad choices. (I feel this is all you need to know...anything more will ruin it for you). There is an air of surrealism thought the film and the use of light and space is very innovative. The cinematography is par excillence and the movi is a visual treat....think ""Blood Simple"" in black in white...you will get a fair idea what this masterpiece is all about.",1045008000,5,1344,4.873362445414847
1438392,4,B00005JKMG,"I recently saw ""Mulholland Drive"" for the first time, and that picture was the first one where I concluded that style could carry a film, even one with not that much plot.  ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", while not as good as ""Mulholland"" enters into this territory, and succeeds almost as well.
I mean, would I have enjoyed this picture if it were in color?  If it didn't take great care with the placement of light and shadow?  If it didn't focus on the face of Billy Bob Thornton, almost always deadpan, almost always with a cigarette in his mouth?  Probably not.  While there is more plot to this one than ""Mulholland"", and it's ok, it is the style of the movie, wonderfully crafted by the Coen brothers, that make it worth repeated viewings.
Take the cigarette smoke as an example.  Cigarettes are such a staple of 1940's films that they are almost an appendage of the actors, male and female.  The lead in this movie smokes basically when he's awake.  There's one fascinating scene in the movie, when a teenage girl he's trying to move in one says there's no smoking in her bedroom.  Why he's in the bedroom is not as interesting as the look on his face when told he couldn't smoke.  It's the reaction of somebody so unprepared for what these days is such a common occurrence that it's almost worth seeing for that moment alone.
That scene aside though, it is the part with the teenage girl, portrayed dreamily by Scarlett Johansson.  His attempted involvement with her has almost nothing to do with the main plot, which consists of blackmail and killing.  I suppose they threw it in to show how deadpan and dreary his personality is even on the brink of actually succeeding with her, but it does make the movie a bit long.  Maybe you just need to have pretty girls in a movie these days to sell tickets, so I guess I'll consider these scenes commercials to lighten up what is otherwise a dark, but very watchable movie.",1044144000,,1922,4.520231213872832
1438393,3,B00005JKMG,"This was one of Billy Bob Thornton's three major releases during the fall of 2001, the others being ""Bandits"" and ""Monster's Ball."" Though many touted his performance as a quiet, cuckolded barber looking for a break as brilliant, I couldn't tell the difference between acting bored and boring acting.
Thornton's the best thing about this movie, but that's because I thought the movie was an uninspired dud. Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini are on screen far too little, and her character's given little to do. The twisty plot isn't really all that twisty, for you can see the consequences coming a mile away. Knowing it's a film noir homage, as well, you're clued in to the fact that none of this is going to end well.
Beautifully photographed in black-and-white, the film is unbearably tedious, particularly its third act with Tony Shalhoub's performance as a smarmy lawyer injecting the story of the film with much-needed energy and narrative color.",1043798400,3,957,5.0251572327044025

1438395,5,B00005JKMG,"Billy Bob Thornton is quite simply a force to be reckoned with.  He has not actually received his due since ""Sling Blade"" but his performances since then have been nuanced as well as a key element of the project he happened to be a part of at the time;(Okay, so I have fallen in love with Billy Bob!!) this was never more evvident than the spine-tingling performances of his and Halle's in ""Monster's Ball.""  In this project, another Coen Brothers classic, he is so low-key, he is scary, so much so that he becomes the ultimate personification of the phrase ""Still waters run deep.""  The movie is a murder mystery shot in black and white with enough twists and turns to keep you totally interested.  Frances McDormand, another artist who is sorely underappreciated, is fabulous as usual as the unfaithful wife who is mistakenly accused of Billy Bob's own indiscretion.  Without giving away too much of the plot, this is another gem from the Coen Brothers that is worth viewing over and over again.",1043280000,2,997,4.706896551724138

We didn't get past him saying he wanted to get into the dry cleaning business. Just a little too Noir for me. But, if you're the type that because the movie is slow, dark and seems like it must be art, then watch away and gush on like the rest of these folks that obviously saw something in this movie that we did not.",1043193600,8,449,4.0
1438420,5,B00005JKMG,"In their last film effort, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Coen brothers were all about their characters outward flair and color; however, their follow-up, The Man Who Wasn't There, finds them in exact contrast where our protagonist is as bland and quiet as imaginable. The odd thing is that I found this colorless one that much more intriguing and interesting, which is a credit to Billy Bob Thorton who plays Ed Crane, a down to earth barber in the 40s who would like nothing more than to have nothing at all happen to him. Ed's almost so unexceptional that people he sees regularly often forget his name and position in the world if he's seen without his barber's smock.
Ed Crane works as a barber with his brother-in-law (Michael Badalucco) and it's nothing fancy, but Ed doesn't mind it. His wife Doris (Frances McDormand) is a bit more vibrant. Ed suspects she may be having an affair with her boss (James Gandolfini). Ed's not the kind of guy to seek out revenge, but when an opportunity presents itself he hatches a blackmail plan. As you would expect, complications arise but Ed seems to get through them without harm as seemingly everyone around him does not.
Thorton steals every scene he's in and we're able to unravel the mystery that is Ed Crane through the look on his face, depending on which stage of bleakness it is in, and through the dry narrative that Thorton has throughout. He's often seen standing in the corner smoking a cigarette doing his best to be invisible that we're soon sucked into Ed's tragic demeanor and can't help but feel for him.
The outstanding cinematography helps set the mood of mystery and the fact that it's a black and white picture brings to mind film noir pictures of yesteryear. The stylized set design is thoroughly crafted and gives the picture that extra authenticity it deserves.
The Man Who Wasn't There is funny, but hardly laugh out loud funny. It's humor is subtle and disguised. The fact that it is that way could probably turn as may people off from the picture as it does on. It's typical Coen quirkiness, but they're still able to channel some freshness into it.",1042848000,5,2123,4.664
1438421,5,B00005JKMG,"Other than the Coen brothers, I can't think of any writer/directors who have assembled a body of work that consists of essentially all gems and no duds in the bunch (well, maybe the Big Lebowski, but even that one is not really bad).  In this movie, the streak continues.
This is pure film noir, a well-filmed black-and-a-white crime movie the way they used to be made.  Actually, like most things from the good-old-days, the memory is better than the reality:  this movie is actually better than most of those old films.
Billy Bob Thorton plays a laconic barber who lives a completely mundane life.  An investment opportunity allows him to break out of his rut, but to get the funds, he needs to resort to blackmail.  Like all the great noir movies, a small crime starts a series of events that get out of control and put the hero in a graver and graver position.  Along the way, the Coens throw in the appropriate twists and make the movie almost flawless.
There are some amusing moments, but this is definitely not a comedy.  Thorton, in particular, does a great job, but the rest of the cast (including a number of Coen brothers regulars, such as Frances McDormand) is also quite good.  The actual violence is relatively limited, and in fact, only in a couple ways is the subject matter more intense than something you'd see in a '50s noir flick.

1438423,5,B00005JKMG,"This is one of those films that plants itself in your brain and keeps popping up.  Deceptively simple, The Coen brothers' ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" tells the story of a man who is run over by life. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the ultimate introvert, about as passive a man as you could imagine.  When he finally decides to take action, he does something remarkably stupid that has fatal consequences for several people.  Thornton's performance is stunning; he keeps us guessing- can he really be that passive and lacking in affect?  Is there something going on in there?  Can the irony of his life get any heavier?
Things I loved: the black and white, post-war, film noir look; the portrayal of small-town 1949 America; Jon Polito's sleazy salesman (reminding me so much of Jackie Gleason); James Gandolfini's portrayal of a sleazebag likable in spite of himself; Frances McDormand as the domineering unfaithful wife (the scene where she asks her husband to shave her legs in the tub is amazing).  Other things I love: the superb use of Beethoven's music (who would have ever guessed it would fit so perfectly in a film noir?); the usual Coen plot twists (the innocent girl wants to do what?); the settings of the department store and the barber shop; the ""wave of the future""-dry cleaning.
I bought the French version of the film from amazon.fr.  The film title in France is ""The Barber,"" and it won the prize at the Cannes 2001 film festival for Mise en Scne.  The three-disc set has the film in black and white, a color version (which I haven't watched yet.  I suspect the film will lose a lot of its power in color), and extensive bonus features-- audio commentary from the Cohen brothers and Billy Bob Thornton, a 49 minute documentary on film noir, an interview with the cinematographer, etc.
Come to think of it, this is very much a French film: no car chases, explosions, special effects, just an intimate and profound look into a tragic soul.",1039478400,7,1957,4.6988304093567255
1438424,3,B00005JKMG,"I'm not a movie afficiando.  I rent DVDs and if I like them or they move me, I buy them. Maybe this movie is too sophisticated for me, I don't know.  I will say that everything about this movie was very professionally executed save for the story.
The cinema-photography; rendered in black and white, rivaled anything that I have ever seen from films shot in the 1940's such as ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep"".  The performances are really crisp as well; you really believed they were the characters they were playing. Even the secondary or minor characters performed beautifully.  Did any get nominated?
The story at times really grabbed me but then it would change directions quite often and I felt like I would have to start all over again with it.  Was this film a satire about our the justice machine?  Was it a quantum theory exercise circa 1950? A morality tale where all of the guilty pay the piper?  And what about the UFO?  Most likely, it was all of the above and all at the same time.  This made it difficult for me appreciate but for you it may just be a wild ride.
Subsequently, I found the story to be rambling and melancholy. Also I felt there were few if any likable characters throughout. I give this film 3 stars for being so well made and preformed even though the story development was chaotic.",1039219200,4,1322,4.475
1438425,5,B00005JKMG,"Once again, the Coen Brothers have crafted an exquisite period story on film. Following up on the sepia tone of ""O Brother..."" the look of this film is darker with more a distinct range of black and white hard edges and shadows, rather than simply a grey patina. It fits the mood, which centers around a simple barber (Billy Bob Thronton) in 1940's Santa Rosa, California, his somewhat antsy wife (Frances McDormand) and a local merchant who may be a crook (James Gandolfini). Simply put (and it's not), it tells the tale of a man who just wants a little bit more out of life and the price he has to pay. Thornton is good as the man with little to say and McDormand is brilliant as the unhappy wife who bites off a little more than she can chew. The Coen Brothers always throw in valuable side characters to intensify the drama and give a wilder spin to the story. I won't reveal any more of the plot, but suffice it to say, it's full of twists and surprises. Brilliant performances are had by every actor (check out the sleazy little salesman who barters with Thorton - ""wink""). Besides being a fun story, paced just right, the look is fantastic, as usual.

1438426,4,B00005JKMG,"The first time I saw the Coen brother's Film Noir homage, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" in the movie theatre, I really didn't like it that much. ""A well made and pretty picture"" I thought to myself, ""but way to slow"".I was disapointed because usually I'm a huuuuge Coen Brothers fan. But then something bizarre happened. I saw the film again on DVD and I absolutely loved everything about it!! Why the change? I think it's because the second time around I had a better ideal of what kind of expectations to come to this movie with. This is not a film with fast paced action or story. Instead this is a passive movie which you just have to let unfold and slowly just flow into your brain. In other words this is the perfect movie to 'space out' too. The closest thing I can compare it to is Stanley Kubrick's ""2001:A Space Odssey"". It's just a beautiful movie that sort of washes over you and later gives the viewer a lot to think about. This Film Noir plot takes place in a late 1940's, small town in Northern California. It is narrated by it's main character, Ed Crane, a barber who spends day afer day doing nothing but cutting hair and chain smoking cigerettes. He is a dreary man who seems to have just let life happen to him (marrige, job etc.). He might as well be wall paper or a potted plant. That is until he takes a chance and attempts extortion and blackmail in order to get in on the new business venture of the future... dry cleaning! From there Ed's life seems to spin indescribably out of control. The Coen brothers have created a weird but wonderful film. It is an homage to Film Noir classics like ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Rings Twice"" in it's smart script and it's look, but at the same time does not play like those movies. Instead it unfolds like a slowly paced, bizarre dream. Billy Bob Thorton gives a great performance as the laconic barber (I love his narration!). Coen brothers regular, Frances McDormand also does a remarkable job as the Barber's unloving wife. Kudos should also be given for some very funny, supporting roles from actors James Gandolfini and Tony Shalhoub. Finally a special mention should be made about Cinematographer, Roger Deakin's brilliant, black & white photography. Deakins has given this movie not only the look of a classic old 1940's Film Noir, but he has created something that I can only describe as moving art! The different shades of black & white he has created are so amazingly beautiful, that they almost become distracting. The DVD for this movie is quite well done. Both the picture and sound are crystal clear. The DVD extras include commentary, trailers and some short interviews with the actors.

You could watch it frame by frame and never find a glitch. The cinematography is brilliant, and the film is in black and white. It could not be in colour, which would distract from its focus. The acting, the casting,  are impeccable. Billy Bob is so absolutely the man who wasn't there that I can't remember his name in the film. This film is the same kind of tragedy as Fargo: you can see exactly what the tragic flaw is, exactly where everything goes wrong, and everything follows absolutely. It is quite beautiful in this logical progression of results to actions. But the focus is on our anti-hero, Billy Bob, who is one of the best developed and most believable characters I have ever seen on screen. Why he didn't get one of those heavy gold statues for this performance is beyond me.
The DVD has a great commentary with the Coen brothers and Billy Bob, quite a funny and interesting commentary. One of the better ones. There are also interviews with the various actors in the film and with the infamous brothers themselves. All in all, I could not recommend any film more highly than this one. There is nothing that simple here. This is a film about life, about fear, about fears of inadequacy, about not being recognized, about everything good you ever tried to do turning to [bad stuff].It is the tragedy of a failure who simply could not be anything other than what he was, and it is utterly brilliant.",1037923200,6,1578,4.536842105263158

It was not in very wide theatrical release, and the reviews were sort of mixed, so when it popped up on the Sundance Channel the other night, I didn't really know quite what to expect. I'm VERY glad I took the time to watch. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is, first and foremost, a GORGEOUS film in crisp, glorious black and white. The plot, with all its unexpected yet believable twists and turns, includes bits of offbeat humor, a glimpse of the afterlife, slightly shocking violence, metaphysical observations, and hubcaps from outer space.

My question is, what happened to the $10,000?  If Big Dave beat the truth out of ""the pansy"" and killed him, why didn't he take the cash back?
Also, why would Ed write his account for the ""men's magazine"" for money when he's about to die in the electric chair?  What's he got planned for the cash?",1035590400,,449,4.258823529411765

This movie is heavy and dark, and my feeling and experience is that the Coen brothers don't do just plain dark very well. While usually their darker comedies are richly absurd, this one is just, well, absurd. And tedious.",1031184000,3,510,4.268041237113402

1438475,4,B00005JKMG,"One of the reasons I love Joel & Ethan Coen's films is the way they subversively explore the ""big questions"" (meaning and meaninglessness, fate versus chance, life, death, morality, redemption, and justice) in stories that are strange, madcap, and sometimes even slapstick.
Each of their films also seems to be a combination homage and satire on tropes of older movies.  Blood Simple is a Hitchcock film, The Hudsucker Proxy is a Capra film, etc.
In each of their earlier films, a certain twisted sense of humor keeps you from noticing the heavyweight intellectual and philosophical issues until they percolate up from the immensely satisfying feeling of entertainment that is the first after effect of the movie.
Not so here.
This film is a beautiful film-noir.  In every way it is true to the genre.  The mood is similar to Mildred Pierce or Double Indemnity.  The problem for me is the ""big questions"" intrude noticably.  For the first time, the Coen's made me feel like they were lecturing me.  They seem to have forgotten the stunning message from the end of Barton Fink (their other rather heavy-going, but more on-target movie): They need John Goodman storming down a flaming hotel corridor shouting ""I'll show you the life of the mind!""  They are being a bit Barton Fink-ish here.
It may be that this starkness of idea is intentional.  It is consistent with the stark narrative and the stark photography.  It is consistent with the noir.  But it lifted me out of the story, so one star is knocked off for me.
If you are a Coen brothers fan, you will want this movie and you will enjoy it and it will hold your interest.  But this is not the movie to show someone who has never seen a Coen brtoher movie.  They will wonder what all the fuss is about.  Start them out with Raising Arizona or O, Brother! Where Art Thou? or the sadly underappreciated The Hudsucker Proxy.  These movies sneak their big ideas in under a broad, funny, entertaining experience.  If you want to wallow in your existentialism, hang out with philosophy grad students.

1438476,3,B00005JKMG,"The Coen brothers are hit and miss at times, but this movie is compelling and quirky.  Filmed in black and white, it follows Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), an assistant barber filling in his days the same way, without ceremony or excitement.  Things stir into action when Crane meets a man who plants the seeds of investing in something new called dry cleaning.  Events follow as Crane needs money to invest, and the owner of a department store (James Gandolfini) becomes central to the plot.  The film is a mystery in some ways, but it is more a convoluted series of events in which Crane gets deeper and deeper into something he can't control.  The film is a dark time capsule, it looks under the surface seeing greed, lust and repressed desires.  The film rolls slowly along, not a classic by any means but something that stays with you.  I agree with one reviewer, the incident in the car with the young girl doesn't ring true, but the rest is pretty believable.  Thornton and Gandolfini are excellent, and Frances McDormand once again shows her range.",1029628800,2,1056,4.6702702702702705

1438478,5,B00005JKMG,"An earlier reviewer referred to one of the characters in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" as the ""innocent piano girl.""  Evidently the cause of the car accident, her attempt to perform fellatio on Billy Bob Thornton's character, Ed, went unnoticed.  That's the point.  Nobody in ""Man"" is innocent.  At one point, Ed tells the piano girl that he has been dealt some bad cards, or not played well the cards he's been dealt.  Neither has anyone else.  Every character expresses the irony of the title.  No one is really ""there.""  Gandolfini's character turns out to have lied about his exploits in the war.  His society heiress wife believes her husband was abducted by UFO's (outside Eugene, Oregon, no less).  McDormand's character met Ed on a blind date and they've been blind to each other ever since.  This is the meaning of Shalhoub's lawyer's speech:  The more you look, the less you see.
This is why ""Man"" held my interest.  Across the arc of my life I have thought I knew certain persons very well.  Let a certain set of events take place, though, especially if I set them in motion, and something unrecognizable appears.  That's the deepest tug of ""Man.""  Even when we look, there's no face to see.  Manipulation cannot save Ed or anyone else; well-intentioned efforts cannot save; the most expensive lawyer cannot save; neither can fantasies of flying saucers or the return of the dead. The ending of the film, with its hope that somewhere Ed and Doris can really talk with each other, hints at the faith and hope that are required to persevere.
One other comment:  The reviewers who observe that ""Casablanca"" is not an example of film noir are right.  ""Man"" is a worthy reinterpretation of the genre, what ""The Maltese Falcon"" would have looked like if it had been made today.  O.K., one more comment:  The script never claims that Big Dave killed the pansy.  That's the meaning of his obvious homosexuality.  In 1949, that lifestyle was even more dangerous than it is today.",1028073600,5,1978,4.736070381231672

1438519,3,B00005JKMG,"The prolific Coen brothers (Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou?) try their hand at film noir with The Man Who Wasn't There. Set in 1949, the movie stars Billy Bob Thornton as Ed, a bottom-of-the-pecking-order barber in a sleepy California town. Shackled to boozy, overbearing wife Doris (Frances McDormand), who is having an affair with her slimy boss Big Dave (James Gandolfini), Ed dreams of breaking out of his quietly desperate life. Opportunity comes knocking in the form a small-time entrepreneur who bustles into town looking for an investor in his nascent dry-cleaning business. Ed decides to take a flier on the business, and raises his $10,000 stake by anonymously blackmailing Big Dave. Thereupon - as you just know they must - the complications and the corpses begin to pile up.
""Gritty"" is a word that generally applies to film noir, but not so here. The Man Who Wasn't There is a nearly endless parade of sumptuous black and white frames that are as glossy and airbrushed as George Hurrell glamour photographs. The movie is like chiffon cake for your eyes, begging adjectives like ""rich"" and ""creamy."" The elegance of the sets and cinematography are strangely at odds with the dark subject matter and the middle-class insignificance of the characters. (The film's title refers to Ed, a man who is so much a part of the wallpaper of his environment as to be virtually unnoticeable.) Still, the genre's conventions are observed: violent death, secrets, a faithless dame, a slick lawyer - and a decent enough guy who gets in over his head. It may be a Dove Bar, but it's still vanilla.
The top-notch cast all deliver polished performances. The protean Billy Bob Thornton, especially, once again proves how uncannily he can inhabit the skin of his character. Here, he somehow manages to wring from the laconic Ed an impressive spectrum of feelings and responses using little more than facial expressions, body language, and finely gauged pauses. McDormand and Gandolfini likewise manage to imbue with complexity characters that would be scarcely more than cardboard cutouts in the hands of lesser performers. And Tony Shalhoub, as napoleonic big-city lawyer Freddie Riedenschneider, is flat brilliant.
Despite the formidable craftsmanship that went into the movie, though, it's not an easy film to like. For one thing, it tends to dawdle a bit, lingering over its own beauty like Narcissus at the water hole. There's not a lot of variety in the pacing. Even the pivotal murder scene plays out deliberately - not slow motion, just slow. More than that, though, it's hard to find anyone in this movie really to root for. The only character we get to know well is Ed - the film is largely his voice-over, first-person narration - and there is something ultimately repellant about his fastidious, self-contained nature. In the end, The Man Who Wasn't There sports a great wardrobe, a swell manicure and a terrific shoeshine - but not enough heart.",1027468800,,2967,4.983870967741935
1438520,5,B00005JKMG,"Since their first film nearly 20 years ago, Ethan and Joel Coen have established themselves among that rather select group of true geniuses of American cinema. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" only further solidifies their status, and ranks among their finest films. It is quiet, low-key, yet nonetheless powerfully searing character study, and an exploration of a culture -the post World War II years - that seemed to harken in that peculiar homogenized American madness, which is all the more dangerous for its near imperceptibility. Ed Crane(brilliantly played by Billy Bob Thornton) is the very embodiment of T.S. Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"": a cadaverish, dour and taciturn human being whose near-fossilized facial expression makes a cigar store wooden Indian's seem animated by comparison. He is utterly devoid of spirit, humor, gumption or direction. He is a small town barber only because he lacks the drive or ambition to be anything else. The fact that his wife Doris(Francis McDormand) is cheating on him with her department store boss barely fazes him (""it's a free country"", he muses). That is until an absurd and sleazy traveling ""entepreneur"" tempts him into investing $10,000 in ""dry cleaning"", the latest technological marvel, American-style. It is then that he endeavors to blackmail his wife""s lover for the money. Without divulging further plot developments, suffice it to say that events spin lethally out of control in ways that recall the Coen's earlier ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo""... ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is a haunting and quietly powerful dissection of an American ""everyman"", as well as an indictment of an alienated society,and the ""pathology of normalcy"" it breeds. The Coen's slyly reinforce their point of view by referring to the nascent flying saucer mania growing at the time, its paranoid element, as well as its significance as a mass wish for escape. Do not miss ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", the latest gem from the Coen Brothers' seeming cornucopia of daring, original, and innovative film artistry.",1027123200,3,2031,5.195121951219512
1438521,3,B00005JKMG,"I am very hit and miss with the Coen's.  Their films are slow-paced and all of the air is vacuumed out of the movie, leaving one with an uncomfortable, queasy feeling. First off--this film is NOT a film noir (neither is Casablanca, as one other reviewer opines). It is more of a send-up of film noir, and very smartly and stylishly utilizes the conventions of the genre. That being said--the film does look great, with some of the best B&W textural work I've ever seen. I like the fact that the BBT character doesn't say much, in fact he hardly even moves! He reminds me of Chance in Being There--he says very little but everyone is reacting to him as if he's given the State of the Union Address. The plot device (blackmail scheme) is very clever and simple, and it is a marvel how much momentum builds from that simple note. I really did not buy the scene where Gandolfini seeks out BBT for advice on what to do about his cuckoldry--come on, Messrs. Coen--he would not be that dumb or brazen. Heck, they didn't even seem like close friends! The scene where Gandolfini & BBT have it out is as intense as can be, and the shark lawyer is monstrously wonderful. I thought the last section of the movie (after Doris kills herself) just fell apart,however, and I was bored stiff to be honest. I had a similar reaction to Barton Fink--there was greatness and there was lameness, and it kinda added up to a big nothing in the end. A lot of delicious artifice that leaves you wanting for real depth and meaning--kind of like cinematic meringue.",1027036800,,1537,4.489285714285714
1438522,4,B00005JKMG,I would have to rate the Coen bro's as high as anybody in hollywood for shear artistic brilliance. I would follow them down any dark alley if they were showing a movie in that alley. The fact that this movie was a disappointment should really come as no surprise to anybody. Nobody has a perfect record of great films and it was only a matter of time before the Coen's stumbled a bit. I've never been impressed by Thornton but I can see why he was cast as the dark protagonist in the story. Unfortunately he just dosn't seem an interesting character and the lack of any interesting characters in the film is where the Coen's drop the ball. This was the big surprise to me after all the great characters in all the other Coen pictures from the witty gangsters in Millers crossing to the archetypal characters in Art Thou. I will say my faith in the Coen's is by no means diminished but I don't think this is one I will revisit.,1026950400,,926,4.327586206896552

1438524,5,B00005JKMG,"Billy Bob Thorton, the ""love 'im or hate 'im"" oddball, bad boy of Hollywood, and tragic hero of ""Man"", mentions in the supplemental ""Making Of.."" section of the DVD that he immediately said ""Yes"" to starring in the Coens' latest opus, because the Coens never ""suck"". And how true that is. While some critics and Coen-affectionadoes alike deemed ""Man"" as not the best Coen Brothers flick, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" has many positive points, and is a faithful contemporary film tribute to the great film noir movies of the 1930's and '40's (""Casablanca"", ""Big Sleep"", etc.)
Set in a small California town, a no account barber (Thorton) suddenly finds his shave and a haircut world twisted and turned upside down by a series of incidents involving his misguided wife (McDormand), her big shot department store manager boss (Gandolfini), and a thrifty entrepreneur, which leads him down a dark tunnel of intrigue, sabotage, murder, and depravity. If the Coens remarkable sense of screenwriting, with such witty expressions and carefully brewed, slow roasted dialogue, humor, and for one of a better words ""screen-play (just good fun filmmaking) doesn't ensnare you into this Coen flick, then Roger Deakins masterful photography will leave you spellbound. ""Man"" was hardly filmed in simple black and white, but a remarkably deep, forboding, and deliberate manipulation of darkness and light. ""Man"" then, transcends film, and becomes art, and it becomes clearly obvious Deakins and the Coens achieved what they set out to do here.
Certainly a long shot departure from ""O Brother"", but not neglecting their own unique abilities to make us think as well as laugh at what we see and hear played out on the screen, the Coens have certainly created a film, or should I say ""art film"", that captivates us and shows us what exactly the art of filmmaking is. Yet another gleaming gem of a movie goes into the crown that is the Coen Brothers shimmering film repetiore.",1026691200,,1954,4.9969325153374236
1438525,4,B00005JKMG,"I have seen many of the Coen Brother's films, and this one ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" left me wondering what to think about it.  Ok, critics (and his devoted fans alike) would love it because of its fantastic style; whereas some other audience would loath the day they decided to watch it, saying ""It's slow, pompous, and not so interesting.""  Me?  I still don't know.
Whichever you may respond, one thing is clear: Billy Bob is a great actor even when he plays a role of an ordinary barber in the late 40s, whose life has been, and will be full of disillusion.  Ed Crane, Bob Thornton's character, is a loser, and he knows it, and tells it through his opening narrations.  Even when he is chain-smoking with a cool style, he knows it.  Or even when a stranger came to have a haircut, and talked about investment of ""dry-cleaning,"" he just listens silently.  With $10,000 you can be rich?  Never believe that!  But he thinks about it later; maybe his life could be changed a little.  Just a little.  So, he sits behind a typewriter and wrote a short note to Dave, a boss of a department store where his wife Doris works, and with whom Doris probably is having an affair.  Here is another Coen Brother's favorite topic -- one wrong footstep gradually leading to abyss.
But do not try to ""relate"" to any characters of the film, let alone Ed.  Just watch how he slowly -- yes, slowly and steadily -- involves people around him into a murder case that eventually changes their lives, especially Ed's.  The story, however, is told in a most dispassionate way, and the hero is captured with a detached tone.  Many people rightly compared the film's black-and-white styles to those of film noir of the 1940s, but thrills or suspence is carefully removed from the entire work.  Don't try to hear a big noise when Ed gets a car crash.  You only see his car flying slowly across the screen -- and from an unexpected angle.
Since the Brother thought about the original idea in 1994, the film took a long time to be made, and perhaps too long.  Sometimes, we must admit, the film seems to wallow in unnecesary and ineffective dialogues -- reference to Roswell and its famous UFO incident don't just work within tightly-knit script, and maybe as they did in ""Blood Simple"" Joel and Ethan Coen should have cut some part of the film off, which runs nearly 2 hours.  And while reliable and underrated Tony Shalhoub is given a big, prominent role (a rare thing, indeed) as a lawyer who convinces anybody of ANYTHING for his expensive fee, Frances McDormand, good as she is, is somehow wasted.  Total impression is that the film is a bit stretched at certain places and at its ending it looks slightly hurriedly told.
""The Man Who Wasn't There"" belongs to the best things Coens did, though it doesn't reach the height of excellent ""Fargo.""  Recommended for Billy Bob's deft acting, and Roger Deakins's photography is another plus, but not a place to start watching the Brothers's original works.  Watch ""Fargo"" first if you haven't, then you might savor the unique style of them.",1026259200,,3061,4.598526703499079
1438526,2,B00005JKMG,"Okay, okay, I like the Coen brothers just as much as the next guy but please, people, this film lacked quite a bit. Billy Bob did a good job - for the script they gave him - but the film was dry and unusually uneventful. I predicted almost all of the film just by knowing that the film would no doubt take a turn for the worse...and than another turn, and another, and so on. I heard someone tell me, ""If you like Fargo, you'll like this film."" WRONG! I loved Fargo but The Man Who Wasn't There was incredibly predictable. In fact, I was surprised that the other barber didn't end up shooting the innocent piano girl by the end of the film.
I recommend this film for one reason: Billy Bob Thorton. He does another standout job as a boring barber with too much time to think about things. As this film turns out, however, those two combinations spell one heck of a disasterous plot line. I went into this film expecting a thinkers movies along the same lines as Fargo or A Simple Plan. What I got was a rude awakening in what two talented brothers are capable of when they put their minds on a creative vacation.",1026172800,4,1111,4.270142180094787
1438587,3,B00005JKMG,"The Coens give us a hash of various existentialist and noir elements.  Perhaps most striking is the similarity between Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) and the unnamed protagonist of Camus' The Stranger.  Both are very quiet, passive, and reserved, and neither is prone to deep introspection.  Both have peeves concerning other people, peeves they keep to themselves.  Neither of them seem happy, but they do not seem unhappy either.  Both men make a series of poor decisions that ultimately lead them to be executed.  Only as they sit on death row do they seem able to make peace with the universe.
Unfortunately the Coens have nothing new thematically to add to The Stranger and some of the classic American noir books (e.g., The Postman Always Rings Twice) that followed in its wake.  Even worse, the plot falls apart near the end.  To take just one example, why doesn't Doris's boss get the $10,000 back from the hustler after killing him?
That being said, the cinemaphotography in this film is outstanding, ranking with the best examples of the 1940s.  It is exciting to know that there is somebody out there who can practice the dying art of black-and-white cinemaphotography so well.
Billy Bob Thornton shows again why he is one of the best actors of his generation.  Somehow his quiet stillness manages to hold our attention throughout the movie.  Nobody has done so much with so few words since Tom Hanks in Castaway.  Thornton's character Ed is a barber, which allows the Coens to obsess over one of their favorite subjects: men's hair and hair gel.  I especially enjoyed the scene in which various men's 1940s hairstyles are demonstrated, including ""The Executive,"" which Ronald Reagan kept through the 1980s.",1026086400,,1717,4.920138888888889
1438588,4,B00005JKMG,"After one viewing, I might have agreed with the reviewers who indicated a vague sense of disappointment with The Man Who Wasn't There.  But with a second viewing, what is revealed is another step in the maturation of the Coen Brothers from the flashy jokesters of the ""Raising Arizona"" period to the role they have now as one of the film world's few truly ""essential"" artists.
Ed Crane, brilliantly portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton, seems at once to be almost a still life, a haunted face observing a world that at first seems small, conventional and dull, but underneath is chaotic and unmoored.  He has no attachment to anything -- not his job, not his wife, not even his own survival.  And while is always under control, he makes statements that indicate a raging internal soul, which is only eased by the piano playing of his friend's teenage daughter.  She becomes, for him, the only goal worth attaining, and at the very moment that her purity is surrendured, his fate is sealed.
There are some wonderful characterizations in this movie that ensure lots of ironic laughs--James Gandolfini and Tony Shaloub are both great playing very lively characters, and the ""pansy"" traveling salesman is portrayed amusingly by the Coen repertory actor Jon Polito.
But this is a dark movie that could have been scripted by Camus, and it is rare thing nowadays for a high-class production like this to risk such a strong foray into existential dread.",1026000000,,1440,4.841463414634147

It is a Film Noir par excellence, beautifully shot in black and white, adding a lot of atmosphere, and enhancing the 50s mood where the film is set.
The story is simple, a small time barber with a dull life, loses his dream of making it big in the new business venture of 'dry cleaning', dicovers his wife is cheating, kills his wife's lover, she is framed for the murder, and he is about to get away with it, but is caught and put on the chair..quite simple story, but with the Coen brothers, it becomes a very original film, and in my opinion, better than their first release, Blood Simple, another Film Noir Classic.
The secret lies in their masterful direction, the cinematography, and of course the brilliant acting. Billy Bob Thorton is wonderful, and although says little, his facial expressions speak volumes, and Tony Shalhoub is marvellous as the fast talking big shot lawyer.
What I believe adds to the film, is the music as well, and using Beethoven's sonata adds a lot of poignacy to the film.

1438591,4,B00005JKMG,"Like almost everyone else says, this is a beautiful example of Film Noir. It has rock-solid performances from the Coens' regulars (McDormand, Polito, Badalucco) as well as a fine cast of today's better actors (Thornton, Gandolfini, Shaloub). The look is spectacular and could have come out of most 40's and 50's hard-boiled detective stories. Some of the scenes are also lit in a Feliniesque super-contrast of light and dark.
Ed Crane suffers from a general ennui and total lack of care about everything. This spills over into his every action. It is this uncaring which prevents him from being emotionally or physically open with his wife. It prevents him from confronting his wife's lover, Dave. It prevents him from truly helping his wife when he finally decides to tell the truth. And it prevents him from taking any real action to save his own life.
However, Ed's detachment is not a result of his actions alone. His wife, friends, and family all work to keep him silent and on the fringe of their lives. This marginalization of Ed finally results in the total collapse of everything around him. In fact, Ed's one attempt to take an active interest in something results in an unwelcome sexual advance from a much younger woman and an horrific crash that nearly kills him.
Joel and Ethan Coen nearly perfectly capture the dissociation from life that is charactaristic of many in this modern age. This is a very good movie held back only by its too many references to 50's pop culture and the somewhat predictable end to Ed's blackmailing of his wife's lover (that is, Dave's attack on Ed and Ed's inadvertant killing of Dave.)
Truly one of the Coens' better works.",1024963200,,1668,4.795138888888889

I believe Billy Bob Thorton deserved an Academy Award Nomination for his very restrained performance of Ed Crane, the hapless, chain smoking 2nd chair barber. And Francis McDormand once again proves she is one of the best actors around with her sturdy portrayal of Ed's ambitious wife.
Beautifully filmed in black and white, the story centers on Ed's Crane's disenchantment with his dismal life and the discovery that his wife is having an affair with her boss ""Big Dave"" played by James Gandolfini. Ed decides after hearing of an opportunity to get into the newly developing dry cleaning industry, to take advantage of the situation and blackmail ""big Dave"" for the investment capital. This ill-fated decision is the catalyst that starts the ball rolling on a downward spiral that ultimately destroys almost everyone in Ed's lonely life.
The portrait painted here is at times painful to watch, but the Coens' know exactly when and where to allow the dark humor to emerge when these ordinary people get caught up in their own acts of corruption.
Watching ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is like watching a tall building implode in slow motion, both beautiful, and terrible at the same time, once you start watching you can't take your eyes away from it until it all falls down.",1024876800,,1557,4.879245283018868
1438593,4,B00005JKMG,"If you want to see a true film noir, the Coen Brothers' new film, ""The Man Wasn't There,"" is an excellent example.  It's dark, slow, depressing, and overall surprising and unpredictable.
This is the story about an ordinary man; a barber at that.  He doesn't talk much, he just cuts the hair, as he says in the opening credits.  His life is starting to get to him, thinking it's dull and unfulfilling.  He gets dragged into a scheme that involves ransom and blackmail.  But as with any other film noir, things quickly steer out of control and everything that thought could never go wrong does.
The acting was really good in this.  Billy Bob does a great job as playing the very mono-toned barber.  The directing and storywriting was also good.  There are some subtle humor in this that catches you off guard; of course in the Coen Brother tradition.  One of my favorite characters was the brother barber who could never keep his mouth shut.
A word of warning:  Since this is a film noir, the pace is very, VERY slow.  However, that's the whole purpose of the movie.  If you cannot stomach movies that are slow and don't get to the point within the first ten minutes, maybe you should see something else.  You will HATE this movie if you cannot stand a slow paced movie.
I haven't had the chance yet, but from looking on the back cover, this DVD is loaded with speical features.  I will be sure to check them out when I get the chance.  Some of the features are a trailer for the movie, comentary, making of feature and more.
Overall, I really did like this movie, but I cannot give it five stars because this is not a movie I would like to see it over and over again.  I would like to see it again, just not a lot.  That is the drawback of film noir.  I don't think this is the Coehn Brothers' best film.  I still say it's a tie between ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski.""  I did like this movie and it did keep my attention the entire time, despite the slow pace.  A very haunting and clever film noir with a dark and eerie feel to it.",1024704000,,2031,4.292105263157895

A certain amount of control over your life has already been given up when you are born. Trying to escape this setup will only lead to misery and your downfall.

The directors should prepare; I suggest they listen to John Sayles'  commentary on the ""Limbo"" DVD or Steve Buscemi on ""Tres Lounge"" for models on what a commentary track should be instead of just winging it.  I wanted to hear a serious discussion (inside gossip is also okay), not a lot of goofy laughter.  I cut out after about thirty minutes; it was a frustrating and irritating thirty minutes.",1022371200,5,487,4.761904761904762
1438596,5,B00005JKMG,"You never know what to expect from the Coen brothers.  I guess that's what we like about them.  I sure never expected a black and white film about a barber in 1949 California to be anything special...but it is.
Billy Bob Thornton, in one of his finest performances, plays Ed Crane, a quiet, almost ghost-like barber who is married to a woman (Frances McDormand) who barely communicates with him.  The problem is, she communicates a little too well with another man who is not her husband.  What appears to be a very simple story takes off in several different directions through the course of the film and all of them are interesting and intriguing.  'The Man Who Wasn't There' is a great example of ""They don't make 'em like that anymore"" filmmaking.  The film noir feel is absolutely on target with wonderful cinematography, great period sets and costumes, and superb acting.  Thornton's Ed Crane is one of those movie characters that I believe will find himself in the ""unforgettable"" category along with Nicholson's McMurphy (from 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest') and Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter.
When the film is over, the viewer is left to think about a lot of things.  Some of the questions the viewer may have are answered in the commentary with the Coen Brothers and Billy Bob Thornton, but most of them are left to the viewer to decipher.  All of the scenes work for me, except for one which happens during a car ride.
It's too bad this film wasn't seriously considered for Oscar contention.  It wouldn't have been a ""safe bet"" like 'A Beautiful Mind' turned out to be, but it would have caused audiences to think while they're entertained.  The Coen Brothers certainly know how to do that.",1022112000,8,1700,4.728813559322034
1438627,5,B00005JKMG,"Here's a film that falls into the category of ""classic noir,"" all but perfectly presented by the Brothers who are, in many ways, reinventing the movie. With stunning black-and-white cinematography and splendid performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Frances McDormand (who, arguably, is one of the best actresses anywhere), the voiceover narrative of the unsmiling ""hero"" of the piece recounts the events leading up to his demise.
There is so much to like about this film: its faithful adherence to the exploration of small lives that become enlarged as a result of haphazard circumstance; its beautifully moody lighting and crisp images--where shadow has as much significance as light; and an overall evenness of tone that never for a moment hits a sour note.
Thornton, as the never-smiling barber with an acceptable life that is bereft of humor, of love, and of any viable friendship, gives a remarkably controlled performance that is perfectly matched by McDormand's barely contained appetite for love, for humor, for life, for something beyond the inertia of her marriage (to Thornton.) This is a film in which what goes unstated has as much power as what is; it also has what used to be referred to as a ""sting in the tail"" at the end.
Nothing can be anticipated in this film; the brothers exercise such great control over the material that even when the viewer thinks s/he knows what's coming, the surprise is there in the ironic ending.
A fine example of top-rate film-making, not to be missed.",1022112000,60,1500,4.9563492063492065
1438628,4,B00005JKMG,"Like many of the Coen brothers' movies, this one is a weird combination of homage, parody, and actual noir.  (It could have benefited from more noir and less art-house, as far as the funereal pace and music go.)  The story of a small-town barber who falls into a murder, beats the rap, but then, in POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE style, faces justice for someone else's crime, it's beautifully photographed, directed, acted.  There are many good lines and the Coens' patented undercurrent of extremely deadpan humor.  You can't take your eyes away from it, and I'll give it four stars for being so much more interesting than most movies . . . but if I rated it for real satisfaction, it would be more like three.
Somehow this one just doesn't hang together like the Coens' best.  For one thing, their usually infallible sense of period isn't firing on all eight cylinders this time.  A business hustler *might* call himself an entrepeneur in 1949, the word existed, but it sounds '80s, and the same character's ""cash flow"" sticks out even worse.  And yes, there was a great--in some ways the first great--flying saucer flap in the late '40s; but the movie fails to capture the actual feel of that flap.  The widow's alien abduction story feels like something from a few decades later (she doesn't even use the word ""saucer""), and I don't believe there was a long story on Roswell in LIFE circa '49; Roswell was a one-week wonder when it happened and only became a legend much later, you could scour the UFO literature from 1950 to 1975 without coming across a mention of it.  Nor do the saucers really fit into this story thematically.  Tony Shaloub's Heisenberg Uncertainty defense, though funny, also seems a little out of place; something you wouldn't try on an American jury until after the '60s.
And the setting is everything.  So much effort is put into making it 1949, and when 1949 keeps failing to come across, something is lost.  If you like the Coen brothers, you'll still enjoy watching this; I did.  But it's not among their best.
p.s. Another reviewer here is mistaken in thinking the brothers haven't used Shaloub before; he has a wonderful bit in BARTON FINK.",1022025600,2,2171,4.711640211640212

1438631,4,B00005JKMG,"In 1984, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen established themselves as filmmakers with their debut film, ""Blood Simple,"" a noirish thriller that heralded a new and unique voice among the denizens of the cinematic world.  Since then, the Coen Brothers have crafted and delivered a number of memorable films, featuring eclectic storylines and diverse characters, all of which have something to say about who we are and what makes us tick; all of the things that make the world go `round.  Whatever the subject matter, at their core their films are all examinations of the human condition; character studies that illuminate the infinitesimal possibilities wrought by that thing we know as human nature.  Whether it's through the ruminations of the Dude in ""The Big Lebowski,"" or the musings of a pomade wearing escaped convict in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?,"" the Coen's films are insightful, as well as entertaining, and always unique.  When you walk into a Coen Brothers film, you never know what you're going to get, but you can bet it's going to be an experience.  And ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" directed by Joel Coen, and starring Billy Bob Thornton and Frances McDormand, is no exception.  In it, they revisit the ""noir"" territory of their first film, while contemplating the suggestion that there are things in life that just may be predestined; fate may provide a choice of paths to traverse, but in the end, they all seemingly lead to the same place.
 It's 1949, in a quiet town in California; a place that suits Ed Crane (Thornton) just fine.  Quiet and unassuming, Ed is the second-chair barber in a small shop owned by his brother-in-law and first-chair barber, Frank (Michael Badalucco).  Unlike most barbers, Ed doesn't like to talk.  He just likes to cut the hair.  Which works out fine, because Frank talks enough for them both.  Ed suspects that his wife, Doris (McDormand), among other things, likes to drink a bit too much; he also suspects that she may be having an affair with her boss, department store owner ""Big Dave"" Brewster (James Gandolfini).  But Ed's not one to get too worked up.  Over anything.  In his quiet and unassuming way, he's an observer; a watcher of the life being lived around him.  Which pretty much suits him just fine.  Almost.
 Ed goes along, cutting hair and watching; sometimes wondering.  About his wife; about life; about what it means to just blend in.  And then something happens that momentarily shakes him loose of his cocoon:  A salesman, Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) blows into town with nothing to sell but an idea; but it's an idea for a revolutionary new concept that will make him-- along with the right investor-- rich.  And Ed is interested.  Because all he'll have to do is invest, let Tolliver do the work, and he can just...blend in.  It's the perfect plan, but like all perfect plans there's a flaw, beginning with the fact that Ed doesn't have the money to invest.  But through a lifetime of watching, Ed has learned a thing or two; and now, he has a plan of his own.  A plan that once put into play will trigger a chain of convoluted events beyond anything he could ever have possibly imagined.  And before it's over, Ed will understand what the guy meant when he said something about ""best laid plans.""  Because his best laid plans are about to change his life forever.  And not necessarily for the good.
 With an approach that is every bit as quiet and unassuming as their protagonist, producer Ethan and director Joel deliver their most subtle film yet.  The story (which the Coen's also wrote themselves) perfectly captures the era in which it is set, and is fraught with the unexpected.  The Coen's weave a web of twists and turns that are almost nonchalantly intricate, and rarely take you where you think you're going.  As in real life, things happen-- the import of which is often not realized until after the fact, and then, only after the next event-- prompted by the first-- occurs.  And as the film has a somewhat mesmerizing quality to it-- aided in no small part by the brilliant B&W cinematography by Roger Deakens-- it is later, upon reflection and after having had a chance to thoroughly digest the events you've witnessed, that you will feel the real impact of it all.  And it's then, most probably in a quiet and unassuming way, that you will say to yourself, ""Wow--""  The Coen Brothers are gifted storytellers and filmmakers, they know what they want to say, and moreover, know exactly how to get it across to their audience.
 All of what the Coens bring to the table makes for a good movie, but in this case, the single element that takes it beyond ""good"" to ""truly inspired,"" is the performance by Billy Bob Thornton as Ed.  In one performance after another, in film after film-- beginning with his dynamic portrayal of Karl in ""Sling Blade""-- Thornton has veritably created a category of actor unique unto himself, that of Leading Man/Character Actor.  Like no other actor, he has the ability to truly transform himself with every new role, so thoroughly that not a trace of himself remains.  And each character he creates is totally new, physically as well as psychologically; it's as if Thornton is the product of some kind of artistic schizophrenic existence that enables him to become just about anyone he chooses.  It's a rare talent, and as he demonstrates-- again-- with his portrayal here of Ed, it's a talent he uses wisely, and most effectively.  And it makes you wonder if there is, in fact, a REAL Billy Bob Thornton.  He is truly, one amazing actor.
 The supporting cast includes Scarlett Johansson (Birdy), Richard Jenkins (Walter), Katherine Borowitz (Ann) and Tony Shalhoub (Riedenschneider).  Thought provoking and transporting, ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" reaffirms the unique genius that ""is"" The Coen Brothers.",1021939200,5,5815,4.805835010060362
1438632,5,B00005JKMG,"When watching this movie for the first time, you can't help but notice that the lead character hardly says a word on screen. He just sit's in the shadows causally smoking a cigarette in every scene. But despite this seemingly boring set-up, the Choen brothers can make even the simplest of normal human actions completly amazing on screen. In fact there isn't a scene in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" that isn't simply incrediable just by the way it's filmed. The plot, about a barber who decides he's had enough of his normal life, play's something out of a Hitchcock flick. The film is in black and white and it couldn't be half as effective any other way. Nor do you want it to be. The shadows play a charcter themselves as they bounce in and out of every scene, causing darkness to fall on even the most pure charcters in the film. (hint-hint)It almost makes you long for the black and white movie genre again. The movie is dark, but it's also a little light in some places.

1438633,3,B00005JKMG,"Strange! That's one of the few things I can say for certain about this movie. After leaving the theatre having seen it for the first time I was confused and not sure at all that I had fully got the point. But now after seeing it for the second time I am even more confused and having an even harder time piecing together the story fragments eventually making up the plot. I have this feeling that the more times I watch it the more details are revealed to me and the more confused I get. This paradox is roughly put the key essence of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and we are being introduced to this principle at more than one occasion during the movie.
The story takes place in the late nineteen fourties in a rather anonymous Northern California city. The main character Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a chain smoking (in most ways mediocre) man of very few words. He works as a barber (2'nd chair) in a barbershop owned by his brother in low and lives a seemingly ordinary life with his wife (Frances McDormand) who is a book-keeper at the city's Nirdlinger's apartment store, and she is having an affair with her boss (the store manager) who happens to be married to the daughter (and heir) of the apartment store owner. One day Ed Crane has a customer who reveals for him his business plan about starting a chain of dry cleaning shops and shares with him his needs for a partner with the proper amount of initial capital. Tired of being an underdog Crane sees in this business proposal an opportunity that could change his life, and knowing about his wife's affair he decides to blackmail her boss in order to raise the required amount of initial capital. From here on things starts to get complicated, nothing goes quite as planned and the story starts taking very unexpected twists and turns.
Filmed in black and white and with Billy Bob Thornton's dry cynical narrative voice bringing the story forward the Coen brothers has succeeded in making an effective modern film noire.
While newcomers to Coen-movies might find this one a little to bizarre for their taste hardcore Coen-fans will get satisfaction for most of their expectations such as: an odd twisting story populated with an abundance of bizarre characters, witty dialogue with a nice 40'ties touch to it and last but not least some very cool clipping techniques focusing on details in the surrounding environment having significant interest seen from a barbers point of view.
But despite all that 'The Man Who Wasn't There' will never be my favourite Coen-movie, the plot isn't interesting enough for that and the story is way too weird to ever get really exciting and one final thing I really regret is the almost total absence of beautiful photography like the kind you'll see in films like 'Miller's Crossing' and 'Fargo'.",1021852800,2,2802,4.720408163265306

It's a film noir only at the surface, with the hero as a dispassionate failure, invisible to everyone surrounding him because of his own impotence.  The silky black and white film captivates a man of indifference trying in futility to hold on to what little passion he has left.  The gorgeous classical music is enchanting as everything crumbles, and only his unconcern can save him from desperation.  And in that unconcern, he finds solace.

1438690,5,B00005JKMG,"... and while others may say this movie is slow, i say that it is just right.  It's those bizarre silences in-between lines that allow you to crawl into the characters' heads and see the utter absurdity of what is playing out in the scene.. but that's only if you allow yourself to be absorbed by it.
my favorite example of this occurs in a scene where Crane (billy bob thornton) is finishing up cutting a boy's hair, but he keeps staring at his head.. several seconds go by as we see what he is seeing.. and finally he turns to his brother-in-law and asks ""you ever think about hair?"".  We are then treated to more silence and again we see what Crane is seeing.. the top of the boy's head.  After some seemingly serious introspection, he again speaks:  ""you know.. it's a part of us.""  Another bizarre silence.. ""and it just keeps growing"".
While this scene says nothing about the film's central story, it is very representative of the character Ed Crane.. and it's moments like this that make the story as a whole work in the way that it does.
This movie is beautifully filmed, and at times, a very tragic story.. but make no mistake, this is an excercise in surrealism, and as such, it is quite different from any movie i've ever seen.

1438693,4,B00005JKMG,"So, now I have two great movies (""Ghost World"" and this) and two good movies (""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" and ""Joe Dirt"") for 2001.  Although I liked ""Ghost World"" better, on the whole, ""Man Who Wasn't There"" is a great movie, much better than ""Curse of Jade Scorpion,"" which is something I thought I'd never say, not because I thought Woody Allen's movie was so great (face it, he's slipping), but because I could never get into a Coen brothers movie before, despite several attempts.
First of all, I thought Billy Bob Thornton's performance really kept the movie going along.  He seems to be the only actor recently come up that understands the importance of subtle shifts in facial gestures and posture to create a mood or to change character.  It was like a virtuoso performance, just watching him. He's a sort of ""thinking man's actor,"" like Orson Welles, but without the bombast. I liked him in ""The Apostle,"" but his character was more straightforward in that one.  He's got the same thing going in ""Man Who Wasn't there"" that the great method actors, Brando, Clift, Landau and Strasberg had at their peak, which is really weird, because if you look at him in this one, Thornton looks like a cross between Montgomery Clift (after the car crash) and an older Martin Landau.
I loved the lawyer, played by Tony Shalhoub.  He's so smooth and polished, and knows how to use words like a stiletto (thanks, Burt Lancaster, for that line).  The scene in which Thornton's wife, Doris (played by Frances McDormand) kills herself is a screamer; He has absolutely no remorse over her death except for the fact it denied him an opportunity for courtroom pyrotechnics.
I also loved the references to such movies as ""Double Indemnity"" (though the name of the dept. store, 'Nirdlinger's' comes from the victims name in James M. Cain's book, not the movie, in which Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler changed it to 'Dietrichson,'
though there's a 'Dietrichson' in this movie [medical examiner], plus the plot is loosely based on 'Indemnity.').  The pansy (Jon Polito) stayed at ""Hobart Arms,"" which is out of ""The Big Sleep.""  The scene in which the kid diving finds the pansy was right out of ""Night of the Hunter,"" and Billy Bob Thornton's undeterred enthusiasm in molding Birdie (Scarlett Johansson) into a great concert pianist reminded me of Jimmy Stewart's mania for reincarnating Judy as the dead Madeleine in ""Vertigo.""  Of course that flops, and Scarlett Johannson gets Thornton into a car crash in an R-rated version of how John Garfield killed Lana Turner in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice.""
Of course, I knew beforehand that the cinematography was superb. I thought that meant ""superb by today's substandards,"" but I'd put its camerawork up against ""Double Indemnity,"" ""Key Largo"" or ""Notorious.""
The only drawback is that Carter Burwell's score was so laid back.  This movie deserved a great, dramatic Germanic score, heavy on tubas, bassoons, double-basses and trombones.  I liked the Beethoven sonatas played so flatly by Scarlett Johansson, but the score apart from them was sort of generic.  So, I give this one 3-1/2 out of 4, based on the score.  With a score like Max Steiner's (like""The Big Sleep""), Roy Webb (""Out of the Past""), Alfred Newman (""All About Eve""), Miklos Rosza (""Double Indemnity""), Franz Waxman (""Sorry, Wrong Number""), Henry Mancini (""Touch of Evil"") or Bernard Herrmann (""Cape Fear"" or ""Vertigo""), this movie would have been 100% solid.
As far as the DVD is concerned, this is the cleanest transfer I've seen of a black-and-white print.  Don't rent, buy this one.",1019779200,2,3597,4.914191419141914
1438694,4,B00005JKMG,"The movie is very nicely done in black and white, very elegant reeking with style. The Coen brothers know how to make a film! Billy Bob plays Ed Crain without any affect. All Ed does is take up space in the world and smoke and smoke and smoke. Ed is not in touch with his spirit, what and who he is, baffles him. Hair grows but it has no spirit its alive and it keeps growing on a person who has died for a little while, wow what a symbol for Ed. He is dead without emotion, without a soul, also compared to the pianist he meets, Bertie played by Scarlett Johaneson, her music is nice and she doesn't make mistakes but there is passion lacking, the piece is not alive and is without spirit. There is one dream Ed has, where he sits on a couch with his wife and he tries to talk to her, which is really really unusual for him and her response is when he gets her name out, is ""I didn't say anything"" as if Ed would not have anything to say, except in response to her. Narcissitic, yes but Ed has created this persona for himself and his wife, so he is as much to blame. His life seems meaningless without any direction, he falls into things without much goal setting or thought. He doesn't seem to know what to do with emotions and when Bertie reaches out to him sexually, he gets flustered. He is trapped, trapped inside himself. The Coens use alot of symbols in their film, I like how they use the spacecraft symbol in different objects throughout the movie and also the shaving. I am not sure what they were trying to show when he was getting shaved at the end, I know that Ed shaved his wifes legs in the beginning of the film, maybe it was some form of justice or maybe just a way to trigger a memory of his past life. Ed narrates as the movie plays out visually, so memory is a key element. Anyways, a really good flick, almost made it to 5 stars.

1438695,5,B00005JKMG,"It is a delight to find the Coens in top form and an equal delight to view their take on Film Noir. Billy Bob Thornton stars as a seemingly bland and simple barber named Ed Crane whose life is about to be turned upside down after he discovers his wife is having an affair with her boss.
The film starts off slowly, allowing plenty of time for the mood to develop and seep into the viewer's consciousness. The movie is filmed in black and white, a good choice for a story centered in small town life - and, of course, black and white film helps drive home the film noir mood. This is noir with a capital N, heavy on mood, insinuation and tone. You can almost feel the length of the slow-paced days, the heaviness of the hours as they creep by. Every shadow, every moment is tinged with foreboding.
Some viewers who are used to the fast pace of most films today might be put off by the slow, langourous pace of this one - but they'll be missing a rare, lovely treat of a film. They might also find Billy Bob Thornton's monotone voice and unemotional exterior a bit off-putting but I didn't. He is, after all, playing a man who fades into the woodwork, a man who people forget as soon as he walks out the door.
He is also a man who wants a different life than the one he's been living and sets out to make his dreams come true. Unfortunately, his efforts set off a complicated set of tragedies. Far from making the film dark and depressing (in spite of the black and white) these events reveal the precariousness of everyday life and the mysteries of the heart",1019520000,9,1557,4.28135593220339
1438730,3,B00005JKMG,"Six years ago the Coen brothers released ""Fargo,"" their most well-received movie.  This movie had a number of successors, the most prominent of them being Sam Raimi's ""A Simple Plan,"" and this movie.  Ostensibly these movies are about the theme that one should not cut moral corners to easy wealth, because inevitably you will pay for the consequences of your actions.  In fact, the real message of these movies was that you shouldn't cut moral corners to easy wealth because as poor ignorant WASP trash you will inevitably make a botch of it.  If it was up to people like the Coen brothers, they would do a much better job of it.  (And indeed such a successful scheme is at the centre of the Coens' amusing ""The Big Lebowski."")
Here the message of this particular movie is that you shouldn't cut moral corners if you intend to spend your life sleepwalking through it.  As Ed Crane, Billy Bob Thornton does a tremendous job adding depth and complexity to a person who in the script is either an idiot or a puppet.  Whereas the classic noirs often dealt with men who were lead astray by intense passions (""Double Indemnity"" comes to mind), the Coens have, somewhat amusingly, provided us what a hero who cannot be bothered to make an effort.  Two of the four deaths of this movie could have been avoided if Crane had tried to make a little effort.  Stuart Klawans in the Nation made the intriguing suggestion that Crane was a deeply closeted homosexual.  Perhaps, since Crane's marriage is clearly sexless,  but, as is so often the case in Coen movies, his conduct is not incompatible with a very flagrant marionette.
Like Fargo, and indeed like A Simple Plan, the Man who Wasn't There is gloriously shot, yet the effect is manipulative.  One is not portraying 1950 California, one is not trying to picture something real or an interesting vision, instead the Coens are saying, ""look, how brilliantly imitative our pastiche/parody of film noir movies are!""  (Shots of Doris Crane is prison are particularly flagrant of this effect.) Tony Shalhoub is actually quite good as the Crane's pompous and expensive lawyer, and there are some amusing shots, including one of the funniest ever made of a car crash.  But consider the young teenager whom Crane is attracted to and whose musical career he encourages.  It is all too typical of the Coens that she is no more and never will be more than competent, and that Crane was foolish to encourage her hopes.  There are a couple of scenes in which Crane and his wife Doris actually show signs of affection towards each other.  One, the more prominent and less successful, occurs where Crane is shaving Doris' legs in the bathtub.  The second occurs as a flashback when Doris brushes aside an irritating salesman.  It is almost enough to make one believe that the Coens are showing some feeling for their puppet.  And yet one considers that this just vindicates their icy sense of control, a drop of sugar in their arsenic.  This movie reflects their amorality, since how can their be a moral core to the movie when Crane barely makes any decisions and arguably shows no real conscience?  At least they are playing other people's moralism for laughs.
A further comment on irony and its uses.  One could argues that Paul Verhoeven's ""Starship Troopers"" was even sicker than ""Showgirls,"" since whereas the latter was just cynical pornography, the former ""ironically"" glamorized a quasi-fascist state, made by a director who had experienced the brutal Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.  Likewise J.Hoberman pointed out the unplesantness of a cringing Jewish homosexual begging for his life in ""Miller's Crossing,"" in a grove as bucolic as any in Poland.  Meanwhile at the height of the Holocaust, ""Barton Fink"" shows the clash between a foolish, pompous, condescending Jewish radical and a crass, vulgar, megalomianical Jewish movie director.  The Coens are people who are buzzed by their own nihilism.  As such works go this is not truly offensive, and is not bad for a fundamentally empty exercise in style.",1019520000,6,4048,4.854439592430859
1438731,4,B00005JKMG,"Though this was a slow paced movie, in my opinion, it was very well written
and all of the characters combined to make this film receive 4/5.
Billy Bob Thornton plays a depressed married man who is second-chair in a Barber shop. Quite content at cutting the hair off people without the 'razzle-dazzle' in which his brother-in-law Frank does superbly ( played by Michael Badalucco ), he suddenly is pushed into a surreal situation. A bald guy walks into the shop wanting a trim and there begins his story of unparralled series of mishaps.
It is heavily narrated by Ed Crane ( played by Billy Bob Thornton ) and it is obvious as to why it is so at the end of the movie. Without giving anything away, it will make perfect sense why this is the case.
Set in the 1940's and filmed in Black and While, it is uniquely filmed and has a great character base. Everyone has a roll to play in this movie which helps it unwind and unravel as time goes along and each putting in a performance which generates a true interest in the movie.
Some people may not like this movie and I probably wouldn't blame them. It starts off very slowly and doesn't really pick up the pace, however, given that the script is written to perfection it does compensate itself well.
Finally, it is one of those movies you either love or loathe. I liked it and I'm sure many will - but comsumer, beware. If you after some type of gangster movie with guns and cars then think again. In fact, dont' bother with this movie. It is well written with a dark insight to a man who just was in the wrong spot at the wrong time - so it would seem.
Overall, it didn't really have the climax I was after at any time during the movie, however, I'll definately give it 4/5.",1019520000,,1723,4.304615384615385

In Billy Bob Thornton's best role and acting job since ""Slingblade,"" he inhabits every corner of the work as Ed Crane, a barber who is being betrayed by his wife Doris and friend, Big Dave.  Instead of deciding to murder Big Dave though, he comes up with an inventive idea to blackmail him to get even. This blackmail sets in motion a whole chain of events and characters for the rest of the movie, a tour de force of ironic twists and tours down the vicissitudes of life.  The supporting cast is outstanding as well with Thornton anchoring the work throughout.

1438734,4,B00005JKMG,"The gifted Coen brothers dabble in a sly send up of film nor in ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE.""  This opulently visual black and white film shimmers in a silver iridescence that belies the corrosive tale of a get rich quick scam that lethally unravels for meek, introspective, non-actualized and barely functional barber Billy Bob Thornton.  With terrific attention to detail, this late 40s tale, set in a small town northern California evokes the time and place and essentia of Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt.""  But with a lot more acerbic humor.
The plot is simple: a small town barber dreams of getting in on the ground floor of dry cleaning riches and blackmails a rich guy who's having an affair with his wife.  But of course things go very wrong.  Billy Bob Thornton is a wonder in a nearly silent, physically still, minimalist role that conjures up images of everyone from Abraham Lincoln to Montgomery Clift.  He is terrific with his micro gestures, tiny nods and muscle twitches....  Frances McDormand is his wife and James Gandolfini is her rich lover. Tony Shalhoub is a too glib defense lawyer.  Cinematographer Roger Deakins deserves equal star billing with his exquisite lighting.
This existential, visual essay, true to a late 40s philosophical mindset, plays with all kinds of post war, post modern, cultural references (flying saucers, Einstein's theory of relativity, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principal, Nabokov's ""Lolita,"" and of course Colin Wilson's ""The Outsider"").
This intentionally slow but mesmerizing movie is even more fun when the Coen brothers and Billy Bob break into their very funny commentary track -- a first for the Coens.  There's also a great interview with cinematographer Deakins and several funny deleted scenes that focus on hair cutting issues.",1019347200,4,1783,5.141868512110727
1438735,3,B00005JKMG,"Like most movies by Ethan and Joel Coen [""Fargo"", ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"", etc.], ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" has many brilliant elements. It stars Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini, none of whom is capable of giving a bad performance, and that's reason enough to see it. Despite all this, I was not bowled over by it the way many critics were.
All great filmmakers, from Hitchcock to Scorcese to the Coens, have made movies that were not completely satisfying because one or more elements didn't work. The problem with ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is that it runs too long. I agree with the French critic who remarked that he had just spent two hours seeing a ninety minute movie.
The movie is set in a 1940s California town. It's one of those places where trouble lies just below its picture perfect surface. Ed [Thornton] is a barber who dreams of being something else. One day a stranger comes into the  shop and claims that he is looking for investors for a chain of dry cleaning stores. Ed sees his chance, but where is he going to get the money? He suspects that his wife [McDormand] is having an affair with her boss [Gandolfini]. He decides to blackmail the guy. The idea works, but then people start dying. Ed and his wife get caught up in a web of deceit. Ed becomes the right man charged with the wrong crime.
The story jumps around in time. In certain parts, you're not sure if you are seeing reality or Ed's fantasies and memories. Close attention is required, although, in the end, there are no great revelations. This is basically a typical film noir thriller that uses much flashier techniques than those used in the old days.
The Coens' big cinematic tricks in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is that it's in  black and white. It was shot in color, which was later desaturated. The look is interesting --  sharper and more contrasted than true black and white films.
Great acting and exquisite photography can't always mask weaknesses in a film's script. If the Coens had been able to tighten and focus the screenplay, this would have been a great movie, rather than a good one. Still, the Coens are to be commended for always trying to redefine the boundaries of commercial filmmaking. Even when one of their movies doesn't impress me, I never stop looking forward to their next project.",1019347200,6,2329,4.620772946859903

7938957,4,B00005JKMG,"The Man Who Wasnt There is  the Coen brothers most confounding film.  While it shares the nihilistic themes of their most original work (Barton Fink, Fargo) it is mercilessly bleak and, save for a brief, bravura turn by Tony Shalhoub as a maniacal lawyer, almost wholly devoid of humor.
If James M. Cain had tried to write The Stranger, he might well have come up with this strange cocktail.  The central conceit is that our taciturn protagonists existence is so insubstantial it manifests the quantum notion of superposition. (Heisenburgs uncertainty principle even makes a cameo.) Filmed in color by the great Roger Deakins, who then desaturated and remastered the final stock into a terrifically crisp black-and-white print, the plots many twists and turns play out before the solemn rhythms of Beethoven.
As usual, The Coens language is gorgeous, and their screenplay contains some of their most thoughtful musings on life.  The cast, featuring many of the Coens regulars (Shalhoub, Frances McDormond, Jon Polito, Michael Badalucco) are their usual sturdy selves.
And overall it is achingly close to perfection.
But.
As much as I may admire the scripts originality and wordcraft, its cinematography and ensemble work, Carter Burwells score, etc. I can not get past Billy Bob Thornton, inexplicably cast in the lead role of barber Ed Crane.  Look, I am sure Mr. Thornton is a nice, intelligent guy.  And some of his line readings are fine (his last speech, in particular, is perfectly delivered).But to me, too often there is something ineffably off about his performance.  It is too mannered, too self-aware; and in moments dangles perilously close to parody.  The Coen brothers have such a grand repertoire of fine actors with whom they have worked, so many of whom would have been better suited to the laconic lead role circa 2001:  John Goodman, John Turturro, Steve Buschemi, etc. What on earth convinced them to  cast Mr. Thornton?
