5555908,5,B00B4XMH9O,"Appreciating so much the complete calm and poise demonstrated by Joan Trumpauer Mulholland as she tells through story, picture and artifact her experiences as a white, southern girl during the Civil Rights movement of the 60s. The story is eloquently framed and supported by the additional recounting of others who were there with her. This film should be seen by each of us who was alive in 1963 and those of us born after that.
Joan's challenge to me to act on my convictions moves to to urge wide distribution and wider discussion. Their are lessons for today in the words of our past. Am I welcoming and appreciative of others who are different from me?
I was particularly moved by her visit to Medgar Evers grave on the occasion of President Obama's election. This film is full of connections across decades.",1362268800,5,813,4.732394366197183
5555909,5,B00B4XMH9O,What Loki has pulled together is an accounting from an insider to major historic events. There is passion behind the telling of this story that would be something less if told by others without out such a deep and personal connection. More than worth the purchase and will be pulled off of the shelf many more times in the years to come.,1361664000,,337,4.451612903225806
5555910,5,B00B4XMH9O,"An Ordinary Hero presents contrasting perspectives in unique and compelling stories.  There is the son as producer telling the story of his mothers heroic actions as a Freedom Rider in the early 1960s. There is the young white daughter questioning the segregation surrounding her as she grows up in the South. There is the contrast of urban and rural communities, North and South, Duke University and Tugaloo College, independence and confinement at Parchman Prison, and intergenerational sharing of the events that helped topple segregation. All of these compelling and contrasting stories are collated with expertise in a documentary alive with artifacts of events, photos, interviews with participants, visits to original sites, music and most importantly, lessons for all generations on our most significant values.  An Ordinary Hero is a video well worth viewing.and sharing/discussing with others!",1361491200,4,903,5.632352941176471
5555911,5,B00B4XMH9O,"I literally cannot express how inspiring this documentary is.  I cried many times watching this at the sacrifice that Joan and others in the Civil Rights Movement made.  Joan knew plenty of times that it could have literally meant her life, but she did it anyway.  She stood up for what is right and therefore made it into the history books.  I mean to be on death row for standing up for what is right was absolutely astounding to me.  To face death death more than a few times.  The world needs more people like her.  Her sacrifice made a difference.  She truly is a HERO!!!!! She is definitely one of mine!!",1361318400,,610,4.383928571428571
5555912,5,B00B4XMH9O,"What an incredible story. It is stories like this that remind you that America has come so far because of people like Joan. I was captivated by Joan's many near-death experiences. She felt such a duty to stand up for what she knew was right. And I especially enjoyed learning more about this part of American history through Joan. I came away with a much better grasp on how truly vile the Southern segregation way of life was, but also that there were many bright souls so willing to change things from the ground up.

Beyond the story being mesmerizing, the film was of such high quality. Great music and stunning photographs through the film. The interviews were deep and informative. The overall production was very well done.

I would recommend this documentary to anyone who wants to feel hope in the American spirit.",1361232000,,823,4.708333333333333
5555913,5,B00B4XMH9O,This is one of the best videos of the civil rights movement I've seen! The stories told by brave and courageous men and women who were on the front lines of this movement gave me a new respect and awe for their actions. Joan Trumpauer Mulholland was active in fighting for rights at a time when her life was in danger for doing so. I could only hope that if I lived then that I would be as brave and stand up for what is right.  Thank you for sharing her story!  This video should be shown in every history class in this country.,1360886400,7,529,4.076923076923077
5555914,5,B00B4XMH9O,"I learned about the civil rights movement in high school, however this film helped bring it to life as told by someone who actually participated in the middle of all the chaos, by standing up for what she believed no matter the consequences.

 Having missed the civil rights movement this film helps to explain what happened and why as well as showing the tragic consequences of hate and bigotry. Its worth the time to watch this for no other reason than to learn from the past to keep it from repeating itself.

Schools should be showing this film to their students.",1360627200,9,567,4.594059405940594
5555915,5,B00B4XMH9O,If you want to know the kind of people it took to win the battle for civil rights in America. For many years Joan Trumpauer's incredible courage was not known even to her children. But every American should know about this courageous woman.,1395360000,,240,4.604651162790698
5555916,5,B00B4XMH9O,"I absolutely loved this documentary! Ms. Mulholland is truly an American hero, her participation during the civil rights movement is inspiring.",1382572800,,143,5.857142857142857
5555917,5,B00B4XMH9O,"I wonder why this woman's history has not been more widely know.  Beautiful, worthwhile, meaningful.  If one is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. or from Tougaloo College, this will be worth viewing.",1372896000,,210,4.9714285714285715
5555918,5,B00B4XMH9O,"This documentary is very well done. Intertwining the stories we've heard about the Civil Rights Movement with new perspectives from those who were there. Told with honesty, heart and at times, humor. It is a movie that should be shared in classrooms. Joan has a way of stating things matter-of-factly that you relate to. She and so many others saw what was wrong and made a stand. Because it was wrong. Period.  At the risk of being killed for the greater good. ""Life has it's hazards..."" Thank you, Freedom Riders!",1370649600,,515,4.722222222222222
5555919,4,B00B4XMH9O,An excellent story of a brave women during a dangerous time. Story of a young white woman and her participation in the Freedom rides. Well done.,1369180800,,144,4.576923076923077
5555920,5,B00B4XMH9O,This is a 5 star film showing how racism taught to a white child can be overcome by self evaluation of the conflict between the teachings of the bible and what white parents teach about blacks. Excellent journey through the turbulent times of the 60s thru the eyes of a white woman.,1365724800,,282,4.4423076923076925
5555921,5,B00B4XMH9O,"This is truly an amazing video.  I am sure there are lots of unsung heroes of the Civil Rights movement, and it is nice to hear the stories of one of the unsung heroes.  There is nothing ordinary about what she has done.  She is truly an amazing woman.",1364688000,,252,4.1020408163265305
5555922,5,B00B4XMH9O,"Joan Trumpauer was no ordinary hero.  She defied the most difficult forces to fight for her beliefs in a just society.  Her story is one I have known about since she entered Tougaloo College in 1961.  It was one of courage, determination, and most of all, integrity.  Joan took seriously the belief that each person has intrinsic equal value, therefore segregation and racial discrimination made no sense to her.  She didn't see color.  Joan was also courageous because she was willing to fight for her beliefs to become a reality.  Mississippi was ground zero for the civil rights movement.  It was an extremely dangerous place, especially for civil rights workers, and most especially for a white female activist fifty years ago.  I witnessed and shared Joan's activities  (we were college roommates) and I can attest to the fact that this documentary captures the spirit and essence of this extraordinary woman.  I recommend this film highly because it is not only Joan's remarkable story but it tells the story of what our nation was like and what was required for change to occur.  I recommend it highly, especially for students of all ages who will  learn a lot about the civil rights movement and this critical era in American history.",1362355200,12,1242,4.885167464114833

8562530,5,B00B4XMH9O,Joan Mulholland's story is an inspiration.  How this white southern college student became a fearless activist is the southern civil rights movement is a story everyone should know.,1445212800,,181,5.464285714285714
8562531,5,B00B4XMH9O,"An Ordinary Hero is a great documentary about a disturbing and tragic time in modern history. Yet which thanks to many special people such as Joan Trumpauer Mullolland, a civil rights activist, managed to budge the glacial pace of racial change in the American Deep South.",1428192000,,272,4.934782608695652
8562532,5,B00B4XMH9O,"This is a must see for its historic value, and seeing how just ordinary people did their part in the civil rights movement.  We often think of the big names forgetting about many others who helped to make it happen.  Well done.",1427673600,,227,4.380952380952381
8562533,5,B00B4XMH9O,"Amazing story. Incredible production. I feel cheated that I did not know of Soror Mulholland's footprint in history before I viewed this film. I'd watch it again and again and again but, the DVD has mysteriously disappeared from my home. I aspire to meet this incredible woman in person one day.",1413676800,,295,4.803921568627451

8562535,4,B00B4XMH9O,"This in a nice piece of history that I had never seen before, even though I am the same age as Joan.  However, the movie itself is difficult to watch as it is mostly interviews and not much there to keep the viewer's attention.  I had hoped to use it with my teenage grandkids, but they drift off.",1409616000,,297,4.103448275862069
8562536,4,B00B4XMH9O,"As another Southern woman who also marched for civil rights back in the Sixties, I loved every second of this beautifully made documentary and was right in there with Joan until she got onto the subject of Obama winning the presidency.
She lost me there.
Obama bears no resemblance to the heroes of the Civil Right Movement.  Yes, it is a good thing that a black man could finally be elected to the presidency but he is a disgrace
and I regret his having won the presidency.
AN ORDINARY HERO is a great work and I appreciate all that Joan did.
Bless them all.",1405036800,2,559,4.375
