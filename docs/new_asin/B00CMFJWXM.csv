8583377,5,B00CMFJWXM,"Love the movie...and loved being in the movie.  Could I be a bit biased?  Maybe, but it really is a good film.",1390262400,,110,3.9545454545454546
8583378,5,B00CMFJWXM,"Good job to you and your family.  The twisted ending reminded me of something out of the Twilight Zone episodes and your brief sheriff/deputy appearance in the opening scenes was right out of the Alfred Hitchcock movies.  Loved how you went from black and white to color.  Made the movie seem more intense.  We had many moments of suspense, intrigue, hiding our eyes and being startled.  We also found times of laughter, while being surprised and entertained.

We also enjoyed hearing the references to Nebraska and knowing that all the Young family seemed to be involved one way or another.  Overall, the Darkening plot was very good and the movie acting, sound, and lighting was pretty good.  We found it very entertaining and a good night of movie watching with the family.",1388620800,,776,4.825757575757576
8583379,3,B00CMFJWXM,The movie didn't have the greatest plot line but it was filmed in my hometown and we loved seeing all the landmarks that were used.,1386028800,,131,4.28
8583380,5,B00CMFJWXM,"If you haven't seen this yet it is definitely one you will want to watch! My favorite thing about it was that it gave me that 80's thriller vibe, I'm a big fan of Nightmare on Elm Street and this is one I can say I like just as much or MORE!",1378771200,,241,3.6538461538461537
8583381,5,B00CMFJWXM,"I recently watched this movie with my mom, and we both really enjoyed it. From the very beginning I noticed that the camera quality was extraordinary for an indie film. The amount of work that went into this production really stands out with the attention to detail, dialogue, and score. The greatest mark of a scary movie happened toward the beginning when my mom looked at me and said ""I'm going to have nightmares!"" It was at that point that we both smiled and knew this movie was going to be of great quality, and not hokey or amateur. The movie kept us guessing right through the twist at the very end. An impressive production - you will not be disappointed!",1376438400,,664,4.4958677685950414
8583382,4,B00CMFJWXM,"The Darkening movie is a suspense horror/thriller that had me jumping several times during the film.  The special effects and great use of music provided an atmosphere that had me wondering how this was a low-budget indie film.  I wasn't able to watch it in the theaters when it released last year, but glad I was able to enjoy it at home in the dark :)",1374796800,,353,4.333333333333333
