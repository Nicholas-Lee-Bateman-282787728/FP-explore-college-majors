8296294,5,B001E4S2I8,"These DVD's are a must have for your CORE teachers and also as a source of good clips for your actual classes of Theology of the Body. Well produces, and clear presentations. Good product, but a little pricey. But, if you want to do your classes well, it's a good investment.",1390435200,,275,4.411764705882353
8296295,5,B001E4S2I8,This is a program that is easily understood at various levels of levels of educational background.  The video is well done and the discussion questions as follow-up generally bring a small group into a good dialogue.,1366156800,,216,5.0
8296296,5,B001E4S2I8,"Our Marriage Prep instructor showed several of the sessions of this DVD in class.  Christopher West's plain-English way of explaining a very deep subject is quite entertaining but also really engages your brain cells.

He explains how every body (everybody), male and female, is beautiful and mysterious.  If I had seen this series as a teenager, I would have been spared years of depression and self-doubts.",1301011200,2,408,5.151515151515151
