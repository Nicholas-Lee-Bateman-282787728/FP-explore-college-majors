It is a good break in between some of the ""busier"" ones, especially during times of stress.  The peaceful visual progress through the seasons has enough change and children's action to be interesting, but not so much it seems fragmented or distracts from watching the various moods of weather.  Sound effects are well-matched to the video.",1386288000,,438,4.891891891891892
7908358,4,B00000FEGF,"I borrowed this video from my local library and it's very cute.  It's simple, filled with children enjoying the weather and has some easy songs to learn to sing.  I am buying a copy for my preschool kids.  The box says ages 18 months to 6 years, but I'd stick to maybe 4 as the oldest.  Great for helping learn how to dress appropriately for the different types of weather.",1111104000,,373,4.285714285714286
