You see, the Comanche Indians put a curse on the white man many moons ago, and now the demon has been released! Of course, no one believes junior, even after folks start to vanish. The story is clunky, the characters are rather lifeless, and the monster is shown for about 30 seconds. However, the creature is just cheeezy enough to make things bearable! If you enjoy 80s schlock-horror, you'll probably love this one...",1282608000,4,510,4.554347826086956

About ten minutes into The Cellar, Kevin Tenney(Witchboard)'s turkey about a monster who lives under the house that the adults (of course) don't think is real, I started getting the feeling I'd seen it before. This is entirely possible, since back in the mid-eighties, there was a persistent rumor in the Pittsburgh metal underground that a band I was fond of were going to do the soundtrack, and so the movie has stuck in my mind. (The soundtrack never materialized, unfortunately, and the band themselves are now long lost to obscurity.) I got it stronger at some times than others, but the feeling never entirely went away. Either the film is that derivative or that forgettable. The end result is the same; it's just plain bad. (And I still don't remember, a couple of hours later, if I'd ever actually seen it before.)

The plot: a guy (Class of 1999's Patrick Kilpatrick) takes a job in the middle of the desert with his new wife (Room's Suzanne Savoy) and their infant daughter. His son (Chris Miller, who, while having only appeared onscreen this one time, has been a voice actor in some of the most successful animated American films of this generation, including both the Shrek and Madagascar series) comes to visit from Chicago, and becomes the person who knows about the monster while the parents refuse to believe. The old geezer who sold the place (the late Ford Rainey) and the local medicine man (Stone Cold's Michael Wren) certainly believe in the monster, but for some reason, they're not telling. So the kid decides he has to kill the thing on his own before it eats his baby sister.

The Cellar has all the usual problems one finds with desperately low-budget late-eighties horror films--pedestrian direction, painful lighting and sound, a silly script, etc.--but what really gets me about this one is that no one went over the details for plausibility. Do you really think that if someone's getting eaten alive in your basement, and the only thing between you and the screaming is a creaky wooden door, you're not going to hear anything? Those little details and the lack of attention to them are pervasive in this movie, and they never fail to drive me bonkers. There are a few passable performances here (Ford Rainey), though they're balanced out by the ridiculous (Michael Wren). If you're on a serious nostalgia kick, it might be worth a rental. But then, will you remember having seen it before? * ",1233964800,,2457,4.801418439716312
