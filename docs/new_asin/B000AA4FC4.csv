8076778,5,B000AA4FC4,"This is an older documentary so there aren't any CGI recreations or flashy graphics and quick cuts from one scene to the next. Using archival footage and simple narration this explains the history of the fallschirmj&auml;ger units from their formation through 1942.

At 0800 hours on May 20, 1941, the first wave of 15,000 paratroopers, 750 glider troops and 7,000 Alpine infantry landed by sea attacked Crete which was held by approximately 39,000 British troops and 9,000 to 11,000 Greek troops. The Germans had estimated 5,000 British troops and no Greeks comprised the defensive forces.

Having broken the Enigma code, the British garrison had received intelligence regarding the German invasion including the numbers of invasion troops, locations, and times. Despite having such an advantage over the Germans the British were unable to hold the island. The German forces suffered high casualty rates which caused Hitler to never conduct another airborne operation during the war, rather he deployed the airborne units as elite infantry on both fronts. Allied military leaders saw the German attack as a prime example of the ability of airborne forces to attack and beat a much larger force. Allied commanders also viewed the fact that German paratroopers did not jump with their weapons as a reason for the high casualty rates because the Germans were forced to run to the canisters holding their equipment while under fire from the defenders.

In an after-action report it was reported to German high command that the preparation by the British indicated prior knowledge of the attack, yet nobody ever considered the possibility the Enigma had been broken.

Although there were mistakes and missed opportunities on both sides the simple fact remains that despite being outnumbered roughly 2 to 1, German paratroopers were able to take the Island of Crete from the entrenched and better armed  British Army.",1465171200,2,1912,5.214983713355049

8076780,4,B000AA4FC4,"Packed solid with factual material on the airborne invasions of Holland, Belgium, Crete, and less on Africa.

I was disappointed that nothing was included on airborne operations in the Soviet Union, particularly as the program makes the point that the Allies provided Ultra code breaking info revealing when and where and how many Germans would attack. Wouldn't the Luftwaffe have done better further East?

Also the narrator might have explained how 40,000 Allied defenders on Crete were defeated by a few planeloads of paratroopers.",1369526400,,534,5.345238095238095
8076781,4,B000AA4FC4,"This DVD primarily presents footage from German newsreels on the German paratroop arm from its formation in 1933 through its largest and most important airborne campaign in Crete in 1941. Nearly all major drops are covered, by both parachute and glider, from Norway to Greece. The film provides very good combat footage though is, because it was from newsreels, very biased in terms of only presenting the positive side of the battles (i.e., no sign of the horendous losses suffered are anywhere to be seen in any of the footage). If you can stomach this bias you will love the footage.

In addition to the footage, there is relatively good analysis included, in the form of an accompanying monotone English accident, on the history of these troops, the covered campaigns and their strengths and weaknesses. Although this analysis is nothing that anyone knowledgeable about these troops would not know, the level of analysis would be excellent for those not very knowledgeable and is definitely much more so than any documentary one would see on the topic on the History, Discovery or Military Channels. Thus highly recommended.",1266451200,3,1128,5.064516129032258
8076782,4,B000AA4FC4,"I felt this video did a good job of showing what the german airborne forces did during the beginning of WWII. Lots of good combat footage shows these elite fighting men in action. Good coverage of the Crete operation.

I would liked to have seen the film delve a little more into their weapons and equipment. Few realize that german paras didn't jump with weapons. They were dropped seperately in a large container. I would have liked for them to show how lightly these units were armed - which makes their achievements even more impressive. It did do a good job of covering the losses to the german transport aircraft, though, and how this affected their ability (as well as desire on the part of higher command) to mount such operations in the future.

On the whole, I recommend this video and enjoyed it.",1229126400,6,807,4.597222222222222
