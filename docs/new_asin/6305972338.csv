1104175,5,6305972338,"Anchor Bay delivers the best and most anticipated horror DVD of the year.  Never released on home video in the US (except in an atrocious edited low-budget EP VHS version called ""The Living Dead""), Grau's super-fun 1974 zombie flick finally receives the definitive presentation it has aways deserved!  Originally released theatrically in the States in an edited version called ""Don't Open the Window"",  this DVD is the original UNCUT version and instantly makes the old (and once Very Valuable) Japanese laserdisc completely obsolete since that version pixelated the brief nudity.  Anchor Bay's DVD is absolutely exceptional.
If you're a zombie film fan or european horror buff, you probably already love this film.  If you've never seen it, just go ahead and buy it --- you will NOT be disappointed!  It's kind of a rip-off of NOTLD, but it has it's own unique twists, it's in glorious color and delivers some very shocking gore moments.  Plus, the zombies are quite unique -- my favorite is the post-autopsy one who's got his chest stitched  closed all the way down his torso.  All in all, a very entertaining zombie film...not as ridiculous as the later Fulci films, but also not as grim as Romero's seminal classic.  The film is presented here in a practically flawless print at 1.85:1.
Also on the DVD are a short (and amusing) introduction by Grau (who hopes we have a ""bad time"" watching the film) plus a separate 20-minute interview with him.  He goes into detail about how the film came to be, how he picked the cast, and what he thinks of horror film audiences.  He comes off as a very cool, intelligent and nice guy.  Too bad he left the business after only a few films.  Besides that, the DVD features one TV spot (for ""Window"") which isn't very thrilling, some ""Window"" radio spots (much better!), plus a photo and poster gallery of the different artwork and posters from the various release versions of the film around the world.  Very cool!  Buy it Now!!!",972172800,47,1970,4.784023668639053

1104272,3,6305972338,"A very grumpy man (Ray Lovelock) is forced into a set of disastrous events when a woman (Cristina Galbo) backs over his motorcycle, leaving him stranded until he can get it repaired.  Anxious to be on his way, this guy sets off with a traveling companion he'd rather have left by the side of the road.  They soon end up in the middle of nowhere, near an experimental project by the Department of Agriculture (they have a machine that kills insects through ultra-sonic radiation.  This machine also turns infants into maniacs and dead people into zombies).  This alone might have made for an excellent entry in the zombie genre but for the introduction of a homicidally stupid police sergeant (Arthur Kennedy at his worst) who is bent on charging this couple with murder in spite of obvious evidence proving otherwise.  All the effective scenes are soon buried under an avalanche of overwrought performances by all of the principal actors.  Apparently, director Jorge Grau believed that BIGGER was better, allowing these actors to overdo their parts in ways that made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Consequentially, the three main characters prove so unlikable that it doesn't really matter what becomes of them during the course of this movie.

1104276,2,6305972338,"*Plot/ending analyzed*

After reading so many positive reviews of this film, I went through an extensive search in an attempt to find this rare film, well, suffice it to say, it was a complete waste of time. This boring rarity, should have never seen the light of day, it is a terrible film which attempts to classify itself as a ""horror"" or ""zombie film"". It takes one hour for us to even see any zombies in the film and when we do, they are so slow and boring, that we don't even care. The zombies are of the typical variety, very dim-witted and slow and yet at other times they use their own blood to invent other zombies, pick a door open with a key , throw a headstone at a policeman, etc, etc.

The lead actor is played by a moronic hippie who only whines instead of actually killing any of the zombies, if he were as tough with action as he was with words, then this mess would have ended a lot quicker but no one believes that there are any zombies. It's a premise that could have been very interesting if the director could have created a viable story that didn't bore us to death. The washed up, drunk-o actor Arthur Kennedy (from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fame- he was the journalist who remarks on Lawrence's annihilation of a Turkish rearguard by saying his memorable line: ""Here, let me take your god damned picture!"") plays a cop who makes no sense and he goes as far as shooting the lead actor! Call that absurd, it was actually quite a stupid scene.

The ending was typical, and the whole film had no plot what-so-ever, I would suggest to people that they avoid this mess. There's a bit of extras on the DVD, namely the has-been director recalling the ""glory days"" of the film, and this is even boring.",1389830400,,1714,4.366771159874608

He also stayed true to Romero's brand of zombie. They are slow-moving, flesh-eating dead people. Unfortunately, this film spends way too much time trying to develop the characters and the plot. Within the first 20 minutes, you understand the premise and have a sense of what will happen. For the rest of the film, I felt like I was constantly waiting for zombies that never come.

1104424,5,6305972338,"What's with the naked lady?...It's as easy as 1, 2, 3.

As soon as our leather clad hero George closes his art dealership and leaves London for the peace and quite of the country on his motorcycle, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie immediately sets itself apart from other zombie films by bombarding the viewer with what is going to cause its epidemic of animated corpses. The boogie man in this film is the industrial pollution of modern civilization. During the fabulous opening montage of gridlock traffic, belching smoke stacks, auto exhaust, and various pedestrians wearing protective breathing masks, a lovely curly haired woman on the side of the road suddenly tosses off her full length trench coat and goes streaking naked across the very intersection in which George is waiting for the light to change. It's a beautifully executed moment of simplistic symbolism that not only grabs the viewers attention in a big way, but clearly illustrates the point of the whole film. Civilization is by definition, an abomination to nature, and this ladies choice to impose nature back onto civilization, disrupts that which has long since become normal to all of us. It's an awesome idea that slaps the audience in the face with its obvious meaning, without giving us any explaination.

The freeways have always been perminant monuments to our time.

After the opening montage, George stops at a gas station to stretch his legs and drink a much needed beverage. It's here that our leading lady Edna, accidentally backs her car up over his bike. Being responsible, decent, and kind, she offers her assistance. Being a patronizing jerk, he takes her car keys and says.
""I'll drive, I mean we don't want to go all the way in reverse do we?""

After a bit of arguement as to whos destination should take president, they decide that placing Edna's junkie sister into rehab is the more pressing need, but George's trip becomes further side tracked due to Edna's unfamiliarity with the area. It is here that George's journey to idealistic serenity is fatally interupted by the walking dead. While asking a local farmer for directions, George notices a very unusual oversized vehicle parked in the middle of the farmers field emitting an eerie and unsettling sound. George discovers that The Department of Agriculture is conducting an experimental method of destroying insects without pesticides by using ultrasonic radiation. George berates the technicians with his pro ecology stance, leaving Edna back at the car to be attacked by a haggard bearded tramp with wet cloth, and red tiger striped eyes. Hearing her cries for help, George and the farmer hurry back to the car, but the bearded tramp is long gone by the time that they get there. From the description she gives of the attacker, the farmer is convinced that it is Guthrie The Looney. The only problem is that Guthrie The Looney drowned about a week ago.

I like Edna's sister Katie. She's exactly what I would look like if I was a woman.

Guthrie The Looney ruturns just in time to spoil Katie's attempt to get high. He chases her to where her photographer husband Martin is busy setting his camera to auto-snap on a tripod along side a river. Martin tries to protect his wife, but is easily killed by this walking dead monster. His death brings the police, and the police bring the detective sergeant in charge of the case.

The first half of the film is all about the plot. You have George and his discoveries of cause and effect with the ultrasonic machine. Edna and her belief that the man who attacked her and her sister is not only the same man, but is actually Guthrie The Walking Dead Looney. Then you have The Sergeant who at first believes that Katie killed her husband to avoid being committed, but later suspects that George might be a devil worshipping sadist when the body count begins to rise.

Kindly put your cellphones on vibrate and stick them where the sun don't shine!

I find the very idea of civilized technological advancement being this films culprit to be down right ironic. I just can't help but feel that this first 50 minutes of plot with only a couple of zombie attacks might just bore the majority of average film goers who need continual bells and whistles at all times. I can almost picture a remake of this great classic, but instead of having industrial pollution creating flesh eating zombies, it would be cell phones and the continual erosion of modern mans text message happy attention spans. As soon as living peoples attention spans fade entirely away, they turn into the mindless living dead. The good news for those that have retained their ability to focus, is that the dialogue and scenes in this gradual build up are chalk full of great memerable moments, and the zombies in this film are far from mindless.

What makes this particular film the greatest zombie movie of the 1970's with the single exception of George Romero's Dawn of The Dead, is the payoff that happens at the 50 minute point. It is when George and Edna find themselves trapped in the underground mausoleum with none other then the walking dead Guthrie, that this film reaches an unprecedented level of sustained tension, unlike any other moment in any other zombie film before or since. Guthrie anoints the eyelids of all the other dead bodies in the room with the blood of the cemeteries caretaker, creating a gang of animated evil dead. For the next 15 minutes, George and Edna are literally an inch away from dying at all times, fighting every single second for their very lives. It is here that you see the truly awesome power of these zombies. They may move slowly, but there is a deep eternal groan when they laboriously turn their stiff bodies to face you. It is as if they are as heavy as boulders while packing all the implied power that that amount of heaviness would supply to their living dead corpses. Rather then seeming awkwardly amusing and mindless like the zombies in Dawn of The Dead, there is an undefinable aura about the zombies in this film. It is like a sinister evil power had infused them with all their living dead abilities, and their lust for human blood and organs. These are serious zombies that just won't die. Nothing George tries to do to them, no mater how damage inflicting seems to bother them at all. By the end of this section, Guthrie and his zombie gang seem so menacing and unstoppable, that they even look like stalking gunfighters from a Sergio Leone Western.

It is absolutely marvelous the amount of anxiety that this prolonged moment can inflict upon the viewer. It is in fact, down right awe inspiring. It is a testimony to all fazes of the movie making process, that director Jorge Grau managed to create, what is in my mind, the single greatest moment of continual peril in the entire zombie genre. That is why this is a five star must own classic. I won't spoil the ending by going any further, suffice to say that in this film, when the going gets tough, you can bet it's because the dead are closing in all around you, and they are seeing red.",1296172800,5,7052,4.715909090909091
1104425,3,6305972338,"(aka The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue)

Above average zombie flick with heavy doses of gut-eating, brain-snacking, heart-chomping gore (in the second half), also characterized by an eerie soundtrack and decent voice-dubbing (it's a Euro-blend production). The zombie makeup is mediocre, but the zombies themselves are pretty creepy - relentless and shambling at times, but quick during certain moments. The story takes place against a back-drop of early-70s counterculture and the very early environmental movement, with blithely ignorant science acting as the unwitting impetus behind the ensuing horror. I liked this movie much more than other Euro-zombie flicks I've seen.

I really liked the way the movie unfolds and is paced, and there are quite a few atmospheric and creepy scenes that i enjoyed.  I think i would put this near the top of my favorite zombie/horror flicks if it weren't for one major annoyance...the detective character played by Arthur Kennedy.

Man was this guy annoying.  I don't know if his ""disbelieving detective"" was made popular by him back in the 70's that it got used-to-death in later cinema or if his was just another in a long line of those movie character cliches, but this film took that idea and ran with it.  Into the ground.  I thought this was more about him than our protagonists or the zombies.

Yes, i suppose it was clever how they structured certain scenes to where we know what happens, but when he shows up in the scene evidence points to our two heroes as the suspicious ones.
Yes, i suppose some viewers find his character interesting, well-acted or humorous.
Yes, the movie does address his character in the end specifically.

Still, i found his presence annoying, overbearing, and tiring.  That's the point of his character?  Maybe.  His un-trusting demeanor is symbolic of class, social, and cultural differences?  Fine.  I'm just saying this movie had the goods and could of concentrated more on the leads and zombies and it would've been much more palatable.  To me anyways.

1104499,4,6305972338,"This film has all the ""hip"" topics for a serious seventies feature film, environmentalism, generation gap issues, paranoia, and even drug/heroin addiction, but add in a smattering of zombies and gore, and this Spanish/Italian production shot in England becomes an instant genre classic.

The film is a little slow to get started as several intertwining story lines get developed (overdeveloped really), but once the first zombie appears, the plot clears the fog line and really moves forward. There's lots of good frights and good bloody zombie cannibalism, including a great scene involving a hospital receptionist and three half-dressed male zombies (hmm...what's that one zombie reaching for?).

Despite the big environmental push of the opening credits, the subplot really narrows down to a generation gap issue between an irascible old police sergeant and a young, hip, long-haired London professional, who through a series of untimely events, finds himself unfairly immersed in a nightmare in the English countryside. The film has good level of paranoia for the youth of the seventies. Our young protagonist fights the good fight, but it's against big odds. No one will believe him as he tries to expose the zombies and the cause for the walking dead. Society just doesn't want to hear the truth and refuses to listen to its youth. Eventually, he finds himself battling not only the bloodthirsty cannibals, but also the police sergeant, whose tunnel vision and prejudice has caused him to not only peg our young hero (and his kind) as a devil-worshiping thrill killer, but also as the reason for all of societies ills.

There's a little bit of unintentional silliness, but this never gets in the way of the story. Good gore. Good shocks, Great fire scenes. Zombie fans will like this one, but don't pair or compare with something like 28 Days Later. It's a lot closer to Night of the Living Dead. Enjoy!",1280102400,2,1909,5.053968253968254

I love Romero's first three films, Fulci's 'Zombie', as well as a host of other great zombie films.

But this isn't one of them.

I'd never even heard of this movie before, but I'm deployed overseas and bored with some unexpected downtime, and whilst I was ordering a copy of 'Dawn' I saw this recommended and took a chance. Now I regret it. The whole thing sucks. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the directing is horrible, and the story just sucks. The zombies are so lame. They just strangle people and maybe eat them later. What the zombies did or didn't do seemed to be decided on a whim as the movie was filmed rather than having a script. Oh, and the explanation for zombies is insipid; they're activated by a machine that eminates vibrations to annoy bugs that accidentally also wakes up the dead. Stupid. And the scene in the graveyard where the one zombie anoints the eyelids of the other corpses to re-animate them is the stupidest thing ever. Don't waste a cent on this crap movie, no matter what you do. There's a reason why you've probably never heard of this movie before. It's a forgotten film for the same reason why rape victims try to forget their experiences.",1266192000,4,1272,4.5701754385964914

Wow, what can I say... This little unknow zombie flick is a real gem. If you are a fan of the genre, or of 70's films with style, amazingly funky music & fashion, then this movie is a must see. Sure, it has bad acting galore and is one of hundreds of other zombie films out there, but there are so many good elements in this film that gives it a fresh feel in this oversaturated class.

Fist off, the zombies are smarter, stronger and more prone to work together using the environment... Awesome! The music was really the first thing that caught my attention about this film. It is a perfect score for a cheesy 70's horror, another big plus. The Bad guy in the film [the police inspector] is someone you really love to hate, which is a must. And finally, lets just say that you will love the ending.

A very welcome addition to my BD collection. Highly recommended.

A long overlooked and underappreciated zombie blast since it first saw the light of day, it is just so wonderful seeing it now in restored hi-def glory.  Ray Lovelock and Christine Galbo star as traveling companions in the U.K. who come afoul of the zombies rising from the graves of a small town after an experimental pesticide is used on the country side.  Adding to their problems is the clueless cop (Arthur Kennedy) who believes that they are responsible for the waves of violence hitting the town.  Directed by Jorge Grau, The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue still manages to be effective to this day, with subtle bits of social commentary peppered throughout, plus some intensely gorey scenes.  All in all, The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue is a pure zombie blast, and whether you're an old fan of the film or a newcomer, picking it up on this superb Blu-Ray should be a no-brainer if you're a horror/zombie fan in the least.",1258329600,,1104,4.729166666666667

But unfortunately it has a serious side effect as it turns people into zombies and even brings the dead back to life to prey upon the living's flesh. A young hippie couple witnessed a horrific cannibalistic murder were accused of the crime they didn't commit as they must convince the police that it was flesh-eating cannibal like creatures that did it and they soon will find out.

Thrilling and shocking yet totally brilliant Italian/Spanish Sci-fi horror that is a very criminally underrated masterpiece of the genre. One of the better ""Night of the Living Dead"" inspired European horror flicks and pre-dates ""Dawn of the Dead"" and Fulci'z ""Zombie 2"" years later, it's very well made and greatly acted with horrific make-up effects. The red-eyed zombies definitely inspired those creatures the audiences of today saw in both 28 Days Later and Weeks Later movies, there is some graphic gore shown in this movie including cannibalism with make-up effects from famed Italian make-up artist Gianneto De Rossi that it might upset some viewers. But it's a very smart and unique cult favorite that has been rediscovered over the years thanks to DVD and video rentals under the titles ""Don't Open the Window"" and ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"".

This Blu-Ray offers this cult classic on a stunning high defintion transfer with awesome picture and sound that nicely remasters the movie very well. The extras are quite good too such as featurettes, Interviews, Trailers, Radio Spots, and Poster-and-still gallery.

1104541,5,6305972338,"Now if you are a horror fan or a zombie fan, this film definately fits the bill.  This takes place in the rural parts of England, mostly outside of Manchester.  The premise is based around a newly introduced couple, one heading to visit her sister and the other a salesman in antiquities who mistakenly meet when the woman puts the salesman's motorcycle in shop after hitting it at a gas station.  The two, taking trips to the outskirts of Manchester, head out together to their destinations, soon find that all is not well in the rural farm lands of Manchester.  Odd attacks that lead to the deaths of folks have occurred and the leads are eventually placed in situations of life and death unaware of who is the murderer since it appears the murderer is mistaken for someone that is already dead.  The lead male, however, soon concludes that an expirmental and environmentally friendly agricultural tractor using magnetic and radio waves to kill the insect pests of crops may in some way be causing the recently dead to rise from the grave.

A cat and mouse game begins between the local police chief, played by the splendid character actor Arthur Kennedy (Lawrence of Arabia), and the salesman who continues his rants about living dead, irresponsible government science, and having been at the wrong place at the wrong time during the deaths of constables.  This leads to a number of scenes of suspense, horror, and unfortunate calamity.  With the word of only the salesman, the police scoff at him and his rants and begin to believe with a great amount of circumstantial evidence that maybe he is the guilty one.  When the small number of zombies do attack around the epicenter of the agricultural machine, they leave no one alive to validate his facts and soon the salesman finds himself wanted by the police.

This movie is a classic for the genre.  The screenplay takes a great deal of care making the zombie epicenter a very localized occurrence.  This makes the film feel much more realistic (for a subject that is supernatural).  Having a lone survivor of a morgue attack at a cemetary or a hospital have no one backing their stories with the only evidence being recently autopsied dead bodies appearing defiled by the witness and doctors or morticians killed is ingenious.  This is no apocalyptic film.  This is pure horror, localized and limited to a small section of a small village.

The movie does have some flaws, though minor in detail.  Some of the dialogue is dated (Arthur Kennedy's police chief rant about hippies was classic).  The gratuitous B-movie blood and boobs crowd seem to get an unexplained full frontal nude woman in a wig run across the streets of Manchester for no apparent reason at the beginning of the film.  I actually still don't know what the point of that was especially when the director could have gotten some non-gratuitious nudity in the film later for such a crowd.  There were a few contrivances that could have been tightened up.  And a tacked on ending was not needed and should have been dropped completely from the film; in the documentary on disk 2, the lead actor even says this stating the film could have been ended a minute earlier at a more brilliant conclusion.

The DVD has many extras and is definately a nice package.  For the film, and its genre, it most certainly is rated 5 out of 5 stars.",1225065600,3,3352,4.711835334476844

All of these have aged well for this viewer and zombie fan. The lack of any depth of emotional involvement and the police-versus-youth schtick hasn't, and comes across as heavy-handed, even for its time. Overall, though, it's worth watching and wading through the padding and sequences of cars driving through the foggy countryside. The first appearance of a zombie, heralded first by sound and empty spaces (and in broad daylight) is classic, even if it feels more derivative than homage to a similar scene in the influencial NIGHT OF THE LVING DEAD. The gore, while mostly of the ""far too loose parts stuffed into a hollowed torso"" variety, is effective as well. The flashbulb sequence is delightfully classic Euro-horror as well.

1104608,3,6305972338,"Those gorehounds expecting a Fulci-like bloodfest may be disappointed at the slow pace of this very different 70's horror movie, but those patient viewers looking for something different will be rewarded.  The plot is structured very much like a detective thriller, with police investigating a murder in a remote English countryside.  Though a zombie is responsible, this particular undead member did not choose to partake of the flesh of his victim--hence the police investigate as a standard murder case.  And, although more zombies eventually make their cannibalistic presence known, the police blindly pursue the case as a murder mystery.

Although slow to get going, director Jorge Grau really wratches up the tension in the final act--especially in a sweat-inducing scene where the zombies trap our heroes in a cemetary basement.  Kudos also to some wonderful photography.

On the negative side, the acting is almost universally weak.  Even veteran Arthur Kennedy--the only ""star"" among the cast--gives a stiff performance, despite having the best role as a fascist police officer. Kennedy's performance isn't helped by the fact that--despite being supposedly british--he unwisely invests his character with a ridiculously stereotypical irish brogue.

It is worth mentioning that despite the film's age, Blue Underground has done a stellar job with this transfer (as usual with tis company).  Extras (at lease on the standard version I purchased) are limited, but include an interesting interview with Director Grau.  Grau has a number of interesting reflections on the film, though he is curiously hard on actor Kennedy (he comments on the actor's alcoholism and little else).

Given the quality of the presentation, solid direction, good writing and price tag of less than $15, LSCL is an excellent value and fine addition to any horror mavens ""zombie"" collection.",1193529600,,1872,5.4206896551724135
1104609,5,6305972338,"If zombies existed and formed their own Zombie Actors' Guild, this is the kind of film they would be fighting (in their patently clumsy way) to appear in.  When I started watching Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, I didn't really know it was a zombie movie; then, by the time it was over, I had it ranked in my personal top three zombie films of all time.  This film is living proof that you can't judge a zombie film by its number of zombies.  It's all about atmosphere, a fact which most European filmmakers have always known, and that's why a film with less than a dozen zombies plays much better than some sweeping epic about a zombie apocalypse.  And I must say this is a thoroughly European film, as it's an Italian-Spanish coproduction featuring a Spanish director (Jorge Grau) and a British cast (and filmed in Britain).  It also goes by many names, including Don't Open the Window, The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue, No profanar el sueo de los muertos, and Non si deve profanare il sonno dei morti.

When you think about it, letting sleeping corpses lie isn't really the problem here; I daresay every single character is wholly in favor of doing just that.  The problem consists of keeping sleeping corpses from rising all on their own.  Either way, the last thing George (Ray Lovelock) expected to be dealing with on his weekend trip to the country was zombies.  Unfortunately for him, a red-headed stranger named Edna (Christine Galbo) accidentally runs over his motorcycle.  He insists that she take him to his destination, but they end up checking on her sister first.  Along the way, Edna is attacked by a decidedly abnormal man, although no one believes her.  Neither do they believe her sister when she claims this same man murdered her husband.  Having arrived at the wrong place at the wrong time, George finds himself basically trapped in town as the hippie-hating police sergeant's main suspect.  His attempt to extricate himself from the situation indirectly leads to him finding ample proof that Edna was telling the truth all along, though.  Not only is the murderer a zombie, he's engaged in waking up some undead friends to join the fun.  Not surprisingly, the gruff sergeant isn't buying such a seemingly cock and bull story of corpses coming to life and feeding on human bodies.  George and Edna are pretty much on their own when it comes to trying to survive the whole, unbelievable situation.

The source of the zombie outbreak is actually rather interesting, as it's a far cry from some wacked-out virus or alien infestation.  The whole storyline is well above average, for that matter, holding together quite well as it forges its own path through the zombie genre.  And the ending?  Well, I can't think of any way to improve it, really.  It's well-nigh perfect.  Additionally, lest my fellow gorehounds despair, there are some excellent scenes of blood and gore as the film proceeds - both in terms of what the zombies do to their victims as well as what their victims do to them as they frantically try to escape the horror all around them.

This 1974 film inevitably draws comparisons to George Romero's immensely influential Night of the Living Dead.  To tell you the truth, I'm not sure which film is the better of the two - although, if I had to choose which of them to watch over again, it would be Let Sleeping Corpses Lie.  That's how impressed I was with this film.",1191715200,,3401,4.702702702702703

1104612,5,6305972338,"""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"" belongs to two sub-genres of horror which were very popular in the 1970's and 80's. The first of these is the Zombie film, also incorporating elements from cannibal films. The influence of Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" is very notable on this film, scenes such as the films heroine being attacked in her car by a vagrant zombie and the shocking finale when the hero is shot dead by the bigoted police inspector are among many moments liberally borrowed from Romero's trailblazing effort. But this is more than a mere pastiche or tribute, and this is due to it being an ecological horror film. The revolt of nature occurs here due to a revolutionary method of insect extermination utilised by the ministry of agriculture. This piece of hi-tech equipment uses radiation and sound waves to drive crop pests to insanity, and confirms director Jorge Grau's determination to challenge modernity with a paranoid and destructive depiction of technology and a vision of the city which shows it as a monstrously polluted and virtually unliveable space. So as well as an excellent zombie film, replete with a number of superior moments of gore, this is a film which highlights the dichotomy between city and countryside (a pre-occupation of much Italian horror), the bigotry of a more repressed older generation towards the young (long hair and faggot clothes!!) represented by the bitter police inspector, and a general feeling of paranoia toward technological progress and modernity.

1104682,4,6305972338,"I gotta tell ya, the negative reviews for this movie kinda piss me off.  If you've seen this movie at all you've almost gotta be a zombie/euro/indie/whatever horror buff.  And if you don't like this at all, but you love, say, 'Zombie' than it looks to me like you've got no interest in genuine horror or atmosphere or anything other than gore and maybe camp.  Now, I like gore a lot, and unintentionally campy films, but there's a helluva lot more to the genre than that.  And, I don't like it when people take all this stuff as camp, cause I think some of these films are pretty damn good.  Though, they make a significant point clear, which is that your pure gore/camp viewer probably isn't going to like this much, even though he likes zombie movies in general.  It's got a fair bit of zombie carnage at the end, but it's got an overly long build up, and even once the zombies show up in mass the film is mainly interested in scaring you, rather than grossing you out.  And though it isn't actively scary, I think it's sufficiently creepy and creates a certain desolate mood that I really like.  Frankly, as far as using zombies for actually horror, rather than gore, purposes, I think 'Let Sleeping Corpses Lie' is the best one I've seen other than NotLD.  In fact, it's pretty severely derivative of that film, even beyond more of less lifting the antagonists from it, but I don't much mind.  Hell, I'd like to see more zombie movies be influenced by that film. (Which is still the greatest horror movie ever, I think. `Dawn of the Dead' might be better in general, but it isn't nearly as effective as a horror movie, even if it makes up for it in other ways. But, anyway...)

I won't go into the plot too much.  Edna and George are unexpectedly thrust together on the British country side... and eventually there are zombies. Zombies to kill, eat etc.  The film does take like 50 minutes to get going, and although I was never terribly bored, it definitely goes on longer than necessary.  There are some subplots about Edna's sister whose a drug-addict, and is suspected of some of the earlier zombie killings, and how the cops don't like these people cause George has got long hair etc.  All of this is just setup for the inevitable zombie sieges, and reiteration of themes from NotLD of how the government isn't reliable in a crisis etc.

Technically speaking, the film is competently done, if not really very flashy.  It's got some nice country scenery, and Grau occasionally generates some rather claustrophobic scenes.  Some have complained about the acting and dialogue, and while it certainly isn't good from a mainstream perspective, it's more than acceptable as far as low-budget horror goes, so don't let that dissuade you if you're a fan of the genre.

The core of the film are just the really nicely done horror scenes.  The final third of the film is fairly tense, with a great invasion of a church they hole up in briefly and the final gory outbreak at the hospital.  It's also got a nicely done, long, zombie stalking sequence.  Also, the initial encounter with the zombies is quite nice, harking back to NotLD again, as a lone zombie terrorizes a woman near her car out in the country.

Still, the film does have a fair bit of gore, done by Gianetto de Rossi, who would, of course, become very famous in Italian gore films.  It's generally fairly run of the mill stuff, lotsa zombies munching guts, but it's quite well done for the time.  It's actually some of his more realistic stuff, if primarily because the camera simply doesn't linger on it the way it would in later films he worked on.  The famed scene of the nurse getting quite mangled is pretty gruesome, if fairly short.

Yeah, that's it.  This is a very good, atmospheric zombie film, and one of the more fitting heirs to the 'Night of the Living Dead' throne.

Grade: B+",1128816000,14,3855,4.5625
1104683,3,6305972338,"...because at the 45-50 minute mark the movie does pick up a good amount.

First off let me say do not I repaet do not pay $30 or more for this.

There has been a set released called"" Fright Pack-The walking dead"" and features 6 Zombie flicks and they are City of the Living Dead, Let the Sleeping Corpses Lie ,Dead Heat, House by the Cemetary and Hell of the Living Dead.

Now let me get to the review:

1- The plot: is quit good but they only problem is there is to much dialogue and this film does get very boring and its hard to remain patient ,but please do so, the movie does pick up its pace quit a bit and you won't be dissapointed. The action gets started at about the 50 minute mark. Though they do show you at the 15 minute mark and the 30 minute mark one of the Zombies. Just be patient.

2- The gore- is there and it is very well done excpet for one part which is quit fake looking but its not really that bad. Gore hounds as myself will be satisfied i was.

3- The acting is very good, and the lead detective is a pisser and is funny as hell, not literally funny but he is always angry and its just fun to watch. The editing is also very good.

4-Zombies- This is a big factor for me the Zombies must be good in any flick or atleast convincable as the Zombies in this flick are excellently well done, they are not blue Zombies like Romeros and not dirty and Crusty and rotting like Fulcis, but very much looking like they do when they were burried with some blood on them as well as all them have red contacts which gives it a good look. These Zombies are slow, not incredibly slow but can move at a decent pace and are in much of a sense quit strong but not like human strong but more of to handle more than one your introuble. They walk very well and the looks on there face are very well done to, these Zombies are well done and in my opinion are way better than Romeros in all of his flick sand just as good as Fulci'sZombie featured in Zombi2 and The Beyond ( if you saw the beyond, the Zombies at the end are similar in way to the one in Let sleeping corpses lie.

5- The atmosphere is very good and this is probably one, if notthe creepiest Zombie films to ever be made its frightening in its own way and can make you get into it.

6-the ending , well not that great in a sense I won't be a spoiler but what i will say is it just ends out of no where i didn't expect it to end, and for that i didn't like it, but there is one thing I did likeI won't say it as its nothing major but its not one of those happy endinggs, i guess.

Overall this is a top notch Zombie movie,and the reason for the 3 stars is for the lack of action for the first 50 minutes and I wish there would have been some more scenes featuring Zombies cause when they are shown eating or killing or in action they are so well done and so creepy its a shame with more Zombie actiuon a better more action filled pace thismovie would be better than all of Romeros and as equally good as Fulcis.

Let the Sleeping Corpses Lie is amust for any Zombie fan to have, and a true fan I think will very much so enjoy this. Just like I said don't shut it off be patient very patient it gets quit good.",1127001600,7,3178,3.9733124018838306
1104684,5,6305972338,"Excellent movie.  I saw this when it came out in 1974.  It was called ""Don't Open The Window"" here in the States.  This is a movie that I've been searching for a long time and add it to my collection.

What else can I say that everyone else has written in their reviews.  A young couple trying to get the police to understand that it's zombies that are killing people, a hard headed detective who thinks they are the killers.

My favorite part was the cemetery scene where a cop gets his legs smashed by a tombstone throwing zombie and devoured.  That scene was real nasty.  I would have hated to meet my doom like that cop.

1104685,1,6305972338,"Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (Jorge Grau, 1974)

I have an ear for dialogue reminiscent of Beethoven during his last days. And I know it. So when I say I could write a better script than that of an actual movie, trust me, that's not meant as a compliment.

Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (aka The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue) has one of the worst scripts ever written. I kid you not. It's horribly, horribly unintentionally funny. Not that it had much to build on, with the premise of the film being that the dead are returning to life thanks to sonic radiation. But really, some incredibly stupid scripts have been given the royal treatment and resulted in some surprisingly good movies. Let Sleeping Corpses Lie is not one of those movies.

George (Ray Lovelock, recently seen in the long-running TV series Incantesimo) is an antiques dealer who's just bought a house in the country. While stopped for gas, his bike is run over by young, beautiful Edna (Cristina Galbo of Riot in a Women's Prison fame), who just happens to be headed the same way. The two of them immediately come under suspicion from the local police sergeant (western movie staple Arthur Kennedy, who turned to making bad horror after 1960; his presence alone should tip you off to the quality of this film) after George tries to run scientists killing bugs with sonic radiation off his land and Edna claims to have been attacked by a man whose description fits a bum who dies a week previous. Well, needless to say, despite George's memorable warning that ""the dead only walk in very bad paperback novels, love,"" nothing could be further from the truth. (The living dead don't actually get to the Manchester morgue until very late in the film, but don't let that stop you.) The first half of this ninety-two minute dog is spent building up the characters, except they're all one-dimensional stereotypes, so there's not much to build up. The second half is spent with various characters trying to avoid the clutches of zombies in various dark places. And when I say dark, I mean dark like ""makes David Fincher films look like Sunday in the Park with George"" dark, as in you can't bloody well see anything dark. Which, actually, may be a good point, since what you can see when the camera has a bit of light to work with is so thoroughly uninspiring.

It's actually sillier than Tombs of the Blind Dead. The only reason it's not getting zero stars is because it's marginally better than The Day After Tomorrow. *",1102982400,8,2481,4.657534246575342
1104686,1,6305972338,"*Plot/ending analyzed*

After reading so many positive reviews of this film, I went through an extensive search in an attempt to find this rare film, well, suffice it to say, it was a complete waste of time. This boring rarity, should have never seen the light of day, it is a terrible film which attempts to classify itself as a ""horror"" or ""zombie film"". It takes one hour for us to even see any zombies in the film and when we do, they are so slow and boring, that we don't even care. The zombies are of the typical variety, very dim-witted and slow and yet at other times they use their own blood to invent other zombies, pick a door open with a key , throw a headstone at a policeman, etc, etc.

The lead actor is played by a moronic hippie who only whines instead of actually killing any of the zombies, if he were as tough with action as he was with words, then this mess would have ended a lot quicker but no one believes that there are any zombies. It's a premise that could have been very interesting if the director could have created a viable story that didn't bore us to death. The washed up, drunk-o actor Arthur Kennedy (from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fame- he was the journalist who remarks on Lawrence's annihilation of a Turkish rearguard by saying his memorable line: ""Here, let me take your god damned picture!"") plays a cop who makes no sense and he goes as far as shooting the lead actor! Call that absurd, it was actually quite a stupid scene.

The ending was typical, and the whole film had no plot what-so-ever, I would suggest to people that they avoid this mess. There's a bit of extras on the DVD, namely the has-been director recalling the ""glory days"" of the film, and this is even boring.",1101945600,11,1714,4.366771159874608
1104687,3,6305972338,"This Italian-Spanish production isn't too bad.  You may want to let these sleeping corpses lie if you're a casual horror fan, but it's required viewing for any hardcore zombie film fan.  Most own it I'm sure.  What we got is our two leading characters, a cute lady and very annoying guy she picks up(when she trashes his cycle).  En route to her heroin addicted sister's house, they run into the antagonist(an agricultural machine that kills insects with ultra sonic radiation or some crap like that), then get caught up in the mystery of her brother in-law's murder.  They dink around with this mystery for about 50 minutes(long after we've figured it all out), then, just as you're about to stop the film out of sheer boredom,  our zombies finally decide to come out of hiding(that no-good ultrasonic radiation is doing it).  These zombies are a bit smarter than the average zombie.  Shooting them in the head don't do jack, but setting them on fire gets a nice response.  For the last half hour our heroes run around trying to convince everyone what's going on as well as shut that stinking machine down.  The final showdown is in the hospital.  Zombies are running amuck, but for some reason, our unconvincible hardnosed detective doesn't see even one of them when he arrives at the hospital(zombies apparently don't show up on film either).  All in all, not a bad movie when it gets rolling.  It's not the best the genre has to offer by any means, but it was ahead of it's time.

Of all the Zombie movies I have seen and own, this is really the only one that gives any explaination as to the existance of the Zombie, i.e, the farmer and his machine. I thought this was an excellent way to start the idea of the Zombie, instead of some Voodoo curse or like in the Romero films the Zombie just appears. Now in Night of the Living Dead, radiation was supposed to have caused the Zombie uprising however, in Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, there is a tangible element into the awakening of the undead. Not to mention that the picture quality is excellent and that it is bright. By that I mean that it isn't always shot in the shadows and at night with a bad camera. There are some night scenes that are shot very very well. So basically I thought that this film was excellent for a European Zombie flick.

1104691,2,6305972338,"I was not familiar with this film until recently, when I viewed it under the title 'The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue', which I'll bet carries considerably more weight for our British friends across the Pond.  It looked like yet another 'infamous' Italian horror film, so I settled in prepared for a freak show and a good time.  I have to agree with one reviewer who noted the film is simply not worthy of the hype, not at all.  There are some things going for it, namely some of the atmosphere, the English setting and location shooting and a little bit of zombie action.
I want to say there's something more to the whole story--that fancy new insecticide technology is inadvertently causing the dead to get up and walk about the English countryside--but I don't think it's there.  Perhaps a comment on the farming industry in the UK?  Methinks I'm thinking too much.
However, the film does a great job of nearly talking itself to death for a good forty minutes or so.  And when we do get some zombie action, it's nothing great.  Some very sick looking people with sub-par makeup waddle around before chewing on what look like sweet-meats from the local butcher, 'grossing' us out.  Our protagonist, a 'strong, silent type' in a leather jacket with a commanding attitude (the early scenes in the gas station are plain funny in a badly dubbed (or seems-like-dubbed) clumsiness.  The director gives us an amusing introduction, hoping we don't have a good time watching the film, presumably because it's supposed to disturb us but actually does much worse: bores us.
However, how can I fault Anchor Bay?  They've done an excellent job cleaning up a 'cult' movie (don't even know how cult this is) that was unavailable for a long, long time.  They always do a very reverent job on these movies, and it's admirable.  Perhaps some big studios could learn a thing or two.
Recommended if you have to inspect every zombie flick out there (particularly Italian).  But there are far better, namely the original Romero film this is obviously inspired by, as well as Romero's sequels and even Fulci's demented foray into the sub-genre.  Americans may get a chuckle out of classic Britishisms like 'And don't bugger me about!'  (Character to gas jockey).",1087948800,,2244,4.792207792207792

First and foremost: 'Sleeping Corpses' is NOT the superior zombie movie reviewers would lead you to believe. Actually, it's not even a good living dead movie at all. What it is, however, is a fun, campy dvd that can be enjoyed with a few friends ready to laugh. Worth two sawbucks? Not really, and don't even fall for the silly notion of buying the Limited Edition Tin version.
I bought this film based on reviews I'd read here and elsewhere proclaiming it to be a superior 'Night of the Living Dead'-inspired film, great zombie film, etc. It doesn't even come close to 'NOTLD', or Fulci's 'Zombie', or even 'Burial Ground'. The zombies, and I believe you only get a grand total of about 10 throughout the film, aren't very-well done. In fact, half of them don't even appear to have much or any make-up on at all. The first 45 minutes of the film are spent establishing the silly plot and character development, giving us one zombie in that whole time. What you end up with are a few pushy characters and a tractor that emits radioactive sound waves designed to drive insects crazy, with the added side-effect of bringing the dead back to life. No joke.
The film is slow-paced, and too much time is spent on the two main characters, who aren't all that interesting. The highlight of the movie is the cranky, accusatory police chief. He makes the film enjoyable, adding a great touch of grumpy-old man humor to an otherwise plodding psuedo-zombie murder mystery plot. The best is his method of interrogation (which amounts to him barking "" admit ya did it "" two questions in ), and his hatred for everyone around him ... He makes the movie worth viewing once, and creates the campy atmosphere that saves 'Sleeping Corpses' from being total garbage.
I'm here to help dispel the myth that 'Sleeping Corpses' is some sort of classic,'must-have' zombie film. I spent my cash based on the reviews, and I'm thoroughly disappointed. I did enjoy the humor of the film, but it fails miserably as a horror or zombie film. Poorly-made zombies, a goofy 'scientific' plot, and a few yanked-out organs and entrails don't always guarantee a good zombie flick. Classic zombie films build terror and tension, give a sense of hopelessness for the characters, and give you great-looking zombies. None of those elements are present here.

It is nicely plotted and beautifully put together - Grau succeeds admirably in making the pictureque English countryside around Windermere appear eerie and haunting, and his tampering with 'zombie lore' (shooting in the head makes no difference, the only way to kill the living dead is to set them on fire - what's more they pass on the 'affliction' by putting the blood of the living onto the eyes of other corpses) merely makes it more unique and interesting.

There were some unexplained sequences in the movie (the nude woman running across the street was one, the living dead dabbing other corpses with blood to bring them back to life was naother), but all in all the bloodletting, the violence, the gory scenes were amazingly filmed. The sound effects of the zombies were relly creepy & atmospheric. Ray Lovelock played a tragic hero as his leading lady, the very sexy Christine Galbo. Arthur Kennedy was a good antagonist to Lovelock's hero & got what he deserved in the end.
The VHS version also offers a short documentary by the director himself explaining how he made the movie. It also featured some theatrical trailers, radio spots, & various artwork regarding this film. Anchor Bay really did a great job restoring this movie including a lot of treats at the end of the film.
I strongly recommend LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE to all horror film fans.",1013644800,4,1646,4.679310344827586
1104823,5,6305972338,"Let Sleeping Corpses Lie is easily one of the best zombie movies ever made! Great screenplay, super directing by Grau, and an absolutely stunning job of cinematography and lighting make this a zombie lover's must-have DVD. There are a few things that 'date' this movie to the early 70's -- a streaker, some bell bottoms, a cool motorcycle -- but all of the above adds to the atmosphere/feel of this wonderful flick. Lot's of cool stuff comes with this Limited Edition Tin DVD and the introduction by the director, and his interview afterwards, is priceless! The actual zombies in this movie are some of my favorites and rank right up there with Fulci's and Romero's in makeup and appearance. The unique storyline offers a refreshing change from the mundane also. Buy it now, thank me later.",1012348800,4,790,4.8161764705882355
1104824,4,6305972338,"This movie gets four stars from me because of its utter strangeness, and because the lead protagonist sounds just like Nigel Tufnel from Spinal Tap. A device is employed to kill insect pests by means of ultrasonic radiation. This machine also, ostensibly by accident, turns infants into flesh-hungry little monsters, and resurrects the dead, the latter of which can in turn make more zombies. The zombies are fairly lethargic, if not uninspired, though they perk right up when it comes to eating guts. Anyway, the Nigel Tufnel sound-alike and his pretty, redheaded girlfriend take to the countryside, dodging both zombies and cops, trying to solve the mystery. Meanwhile, the undead contagion spreads rapidly---it seems that the zombies can only be destroyed by fire. Would I recommend this movie? Yes, as long as you're in for surreal entertainment. And, best of all, there are no ""Gates of Hell"" to be found anywhere.",998092800,2,919,5.0927152317880795
1104825,3,6305972338,"Cashing in on Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead, this film is widely considered to be one of the best zombie films to follow and preceed ""Dawn of the Dead(1979)"". An ""overstatement"" in my view. It's a well crafted film,(well sort of), compromised by a decent script(keyword-""decent"") And perfomed by actors, who can act-(thankgod)-and very good indeed. The direction by Jordi Grau is quit satisfactory,if somewhat heavy-handed, if lacking in other places. But  he has a key nack for atmosphere, and character devlopment , as well for some rather stlyish, flamboyant compostions. He knows how to fill the screen with dread--but I guess not quite enough, for I found myself fastly asleep during my first viewing of this film-(not a good sign). Though I gave the film another chance, I still find the experience quit..Dull. It's a competent simple film, that moves at a somewhat slugish pace, obviously to let the audience learn and get to know the characters, and you won't find me complaining, it's just that I didn't really find any of the characters that intresting. The script like I said, is decent. It hits upon many intresting angles, but many of these angles are just not expolited or explored  to it's fullest, if not conscience to the filmakers. The Director doesn't seem to hit upon the script's librals, or if so delivers it in sort of a flat, workman-like fashion. What he does do right, is the empahesis on atmosphere and less on gore(which is always a good thing) benifited by wonderful English countryside settings and back roads. Overall it's a decent competenly-crafted Zombie shocker gem, if somewhat hurt by a script not devloped to it's fullest, if not plain dull period. Maybe  It's just that the movie is not my cup of tea, so to speak. Recomended to Horror buffs, aimed mostly to the Zombie subgenre.

1104826,4,6305972338,"Sure 'Night' and 'Dawn' are confirmed zombie classics, but if you want something a little darker, a little more atmospheric, and a whole lot of popcorn-munching fun, check out 'Let Sleeping Corpses Lie'. Zombie fans who slam this film for being too slow or plodding are missing the point-sure it's not wall-to-wall action and gore but if you ask me, that's what elevates it. It's stately pace and low-key style make the later scenes of carnage and zombie mayhem all the more jarring. It helps to watch 'Sleeping' without the images of other wall-to-wall action/ zombie epics in your brain-after all-it's a film that pretends that no other zombie flicks exist. Killer photography, a jazzy score, a cool old-fashioned storyline,and a gorgeous yet creepy locale all highlight this zombie thriller. So, turn off the lights, bolt the door, and get some perverse thrills from a sorely underrated horror gem.",989452800,,901,5.053691275167785
1104827,3,6305972338,"This is a pretty good ""living dead"" movie--but nowhere near as good as the classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" as some people claim.  I still have no idea what the nude woman is in the beginning of the movie for.  It's definitely worth watching and owning if you collect horror movies.  I didn't find this movie to be scary but it was entertaining.",978220800,2,347,4.390625
1104828,4,6305972338,"Let me preface this by saying that any fan of the Italien zombie/cannibal genre needs to have a tolerance for bad acting, poor dialogue, and nonsensical plotlines. Nobody watches movies like ZOMBIE, THE BEYOND, or LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE expecting a well-crafted film; what we want is atmosphere, gore, and maybe some unintentional humor. On those grounds, ""spaghetti horror"" usually delivers...
That said, LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE is a silly, frequently creepy and entirely entertaining representative of the genre. The movie has two faces: On the one hand, it's a fairly effective zombie horror film in the same vein as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, relying more on atmospherics (panning views of the gorgeous English countryside, the raspy breathing of unseen zombies, etc.) than out-and-out zombie gore, although there are a few pretty harsh cannibalism scenes, most notably when a hospital receptionist's breast is ripped off. Although the zombies in this case are of scientific origin, there's an eerie supernatural element to them, particularly in a gothic zombie attack scene. Our ""heros"" hole up in a room above the crypt, as three hungry zombies try to smash through the door with an uprooted tombstone... creepy!
On the other hand, LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE is also campy, unintentionally funny B-grade trash, ripe for the MST3K treatment. Convinced they are satanists responsible for the grissly murders, the most hardboiled rural cop you've ever seen--something of a Scottish Columbo--follows our protagonists (George and Edna) around the countryside, spouting off all sorts of REEFER MADNESS-caliber copspeak along the way. My personal favorite, to the leather-jacketted, hippy George...""I know you're type, with your long hair and faggot clothes, into drugs, sex and all sorts of filth!"" HAH! Needless to say, Sgt. Kickass is good for a few other outbirsts and some unexpected humor in an otherwise dark movie...
Added perks include the stunningly beautiful setting--many gorgeous and haunting shots of the English hills and countryside, supposedly teeming with blood-hungry zombies--and a real headscratching scene not even five minutes into the movie, when a woman throws off her overcoat and runs buck-naked, breasts bouncing, across a city street... the scene is never explained or re-visited, which makes it that much funnier, in my opinion!
Goofy, cheesy, campy fun. If you can't watch a movie this ridiculous without cracking a smile, you must be a zombie.",976060800,9,2474,5.362467866323907

It wasn't the original title sequence , it was put on with a title generator ! Otherwise the film is entirely intact.
I own a 16MM print I purchased from a new York booking agency and it's completely uncut .
If it wasn't for the title sequence, this would be a 5 star , must have horror film.

7898976,4,6305972338,"While the word ""hippie"" is thrown around a couple of times, the age of Aquarius was all but over in 1974. It was the age of the streaker though so if you never saw one, there's one in this.

Nothing like finding a film I've never heard of and being happy with the viewing. This movie does burn slowly at first. There's a murder, most of the death being left up to the imagination. There's the investigation where Arthur Kennedy gets to be curmudgeonly and almost maintain an Irish accent throughout. The leads are attractive and thrown into a situation which at first seems just irritating but soon becomes deadly dangerous.

The music is most effective when it's mostly sound effects. When the zombie get going they really get going (yeah, they're the slow kind, but they are inventive!) and the gore gets more intense as we near the climax, pointing toward Romeros Dawn of the Dead but ahead of it by four years.

One thing I learned while watching that is that what's even more dangerous than zombies is Brits trying to drive in reverse!

Unlike so many Amazon prime flicks, the print of this one is excellent as is the sound. Ignore the nay sayers and give it a try.",1512864000,2,1170,4.504716981132075

How this rubbish has 4.5 stars is beyond me. It is not a zombie movie; it's more like a dated English murder mystery with three bloodthirsty nuts who really only start doing anything evil about halfway through the movie. Meanwhile you have to suffer through the kind of dialog that Austin Powers was imitating: guys with muttonchops and bellbottoms saying things like ""Good show, I'll get a spot of tea and be there directly, what!"" The characters are all hippies, ineffectual stereotyped prissy women, or hackneyed cops with strange accents, and the dubbing is dreadful. Whenever the scenes are outside (and that's most of them) the words are so off from the mouth movements that it might as well be a Godzilla movie. OK so the Blu Ray transfer is very bright and clean.
