3654843,3,B001JAHS78,"Shout! Factory confirmed on its Facebook page that this set will NOT include the ""Facts of Life Down Under"" movie which aired during season 7. It is an exclusive to the ""Complete Series"" box set. I think that this is particularly greedy and unfair to us fans who had already bought all of seasons 1 to 5 individually before the box set release (including myself). I've also purchased seasons 6 and 7 individual sets since then, which I'm grateful that they've put out. As Shout!'s Season 4 Box set included the corresponding ""Facts of Life Goes to Paris"" movie, wouldn't it be more consistent to include the ""Down Under"" movie that aired in season 7 on this set? It's unfair to expect loyal customers who've purchased all the individual sets up to this point to shell out $100 for the Complete Series, especially when those like myself who've purchased each set new direct from retail have spent well over that amount on all of the individual sets up to this point.",1447027200,15,965,4.649122807017544

3654845,4,B001JAHS78,"THE FACTS OF LIFE was a sitcom that was a spinoff of DIFFERENT STROKES pertaining to the Drummond's former maid Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)who takes a job working as the housemother at a an all-girls only private school boarding care called Eastland School in Peekskill, New York and the 4 girls under her care were the spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), the tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon), the heavy-set, but impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), and the youngest and gossipy Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsay(Kim Fields).

Eventually, Jo and Blair had graduated from the Eastland Academy in the 4th Season Finale in the Spring of 1983 and in the Fall of 1983 when NBC kicked off its 5th Season; Mrs. G along with Blair, Jo, Natalie, and Tootie all moved out of Eastland School and Mrs. Garrett had started a business of her own called ""Edna's Edibles"" which all 4 girls worked at until it was burned down and rebuilt into a pop culture-influenced gift store which Mrs. G's sister Beverly Ann Stickle(Cloris Leachman)took over in its 7th Season when this show was moved to Saturdays in the Fall of 1985.

This 1986-87 Season is awesome and takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Come Home to NBC"".",1345075200,5,1243,4.886255924170616

8312442,5,B001JAHS78,In season 8 of the facts of life it turns out to be A 3/4ths as funny as in previous seasons!  Get ready to laugh your socks off!  This season of facts of life is also can of sad!  I had my doubts about this season but I was wrong about it not being funny!,1499472000,,256,3.618181818181818
8312443,4,B001JAHS78,It's funny but I miss Mrs Garrett even though her sister is a great character. The girls are strong enough at this point to carry the show on their own.running their little eighties knock knack shop. It's really such a fun show.at the same time it also tackled issues that young people face but in a good more wholesome way without being overly corny .the characters are believable and realistic. They are real people and some of the best written c harachters on eighties television in my opinion,1498435200,,496,4.6477272727272725
8312444,5,B001JAHS78,I love this DVD because Mrs. Garrett finally found happiness in a new husband and goes with him to join up with the Peace Corps and Cloris Leachman who plays her sister joins the cast. This was really well done sitcom,1496188800,,217,4.317073170731708

Watched this entire show when I was a teenager but had to stop watching it around season 3 since we moved to Germany and they weren't giving this series over there. But now I had to buy the entire series to watch it with my 2 teenagers. Which I may say love growing up with Jo, Blair, Tootie, & Natalie and Ms. Garret and there fun times.",1486944000,,403,4.05
