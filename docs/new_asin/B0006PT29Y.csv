2190807,5,B0006PT29Y,"I have spent the last year painfully reading anything I can get my hands on about reloading.  This short video puts out so much information that I watched it three times in a row.

In the video, it shows you how to reload pistol and rifle ammunition.  These processes are slightly different, and this DVD shows you what is the same and what is different.

If you are wondering what equipment is necessary to buy in order to reload, get this video.  He explains everything that you need to successfully reload.  I personally have the same press that is shown in the DVD, the RCBS Rock Chucker Supreme&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RCBS-Rock-Chucker-Supreme-Master-Reloading-Kit-9357/dp/B000ML9PU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RCBS Rock Chucker Supreme Master Reloading Kit - 9357</a>.  Pay attention to the list of tools he tells you to get, I ended up buying a bunch of tools that I didn't really need.  THIS DVD WILL SAVE YOU MONEY!!!!

A word of caution: I suggest that you use/build a really sturdy wooden work bench.  The pieces of wood he slapped together is not what you want to use for your reloading bench!!!

Summary:  Great DVD for reloading newbees.  More experienced reloaders wouldn't like this DVD.  Reloading is a safe and fun hobby and this DVD will put you on the right path to successful reloading.",1194393600,5,1359,5.231481481481482
2190808,5,B0006PT29Y,"I purchased this, hesitantly, after buying another reloading DVD that I found disappointing. However, this was a pleasant surprise.  It was so detailed that it immediately solved a problem I was having understanding trimming cases.  I would venture to say, that if you had just bought a press and watched this video, you'd be able to sit down and start reloading immediately.

In fact, the only negative I had was I didn't care for the background music between chapters.  I have recommended this to friends.",1170979200,4,507,4.929411764705883
2190809,5,B0006PT29Y,"This is a great DVD! The DVD answered all my questions as a beginner to reloading, and following the narrator I am reloading unharmed.  I highly recommend this product for beginners like me!

2190811,3,B0006PT29Y,"While I found the instruction pretty good, the quality of the DVD is pretty awful.  It was kind of hard to follow the narrative because the DVD kept jumping around and ""freezing.""",1130889600,,179,4.59375
2190812,5,B0006PT29Y,"Most of the reloading video's I've seen are all over the place.  They talk about so many of the different reloading platforms that they don't spend enough time on the essentials.  One thing I like about this video is picks a platform and then gets right down to how-to use it to reload.  Let's face it, all the steps are basically the same--no matter what you use.  I would say that this video is more for the beginner than the seasoned reloader.  And if anything, the author ovedoes the safety aspects.  He even includes a minor accident he had while making the video and uses it as a proof that safety glasses should always be worn (probably true--I don't wear mine ofen enough)  This dvd is shorter than most of the other videos, but it has so many chapters 36 in a 40+ minute video that you can pick out the parts you need to watch over.  So if you are like me, and forget how to roll crimp a case you can watch that part and refresh your memory.

  I would say if you are just getting started this is a great video to watch.  Kind of like having a friend show you what to do.  If you are a seasoned reloader this will only be a rehash of what you already know.",1101686400,26,1165,4.147321428571429

8042234,5,B0006PT29Y,This video was very informative for someone new to reloading like myself. I was impressed with the way it was presented in a simple format so anyone could get the basic idea of reloading.,1329696000,,187,4.529411764705882
8042235,4,B0006PT29Y,"A bit unsophisticated and 'quaint', but thorough and well put together. Unlike most of the reloading DVDs or videos, which are mostly made by manufacturers of equipment, this one does not insult your intelligence by shamelessly pushing a particular brand of equipment over and over. It picks one kit and shows you how to do the most basic and common (and critical) things that you need to know before you start. I think it's a great resource for the beginner, and even the advanced user can learn a few things perhaps.

It runs through everything pretty fast though. I would have preferred a bit more time than '41 minutes'. It was not really enough.

While Mr. Curran is knowledgeable and a good narrator, in a rustic quaint sort of way, it's annoying when he miss-pronounces simple words, like calling adjustment bushings in a case trimmer, 'brushings' over and over, and other such things. Also, I would respectfully advise perhaps clean hands, and god forbid a manicure even, before shooting a video with close up of your hands and fingers for the whole length of the video... when the audience is trying to focus on close ups of your hands performing some intricate adjustment, it's a bit distracting... the dirt and grime under the chipped fingernails...

On the whole, it's a good, although somewhat overpriced product. I enjoyed it and have watched it a couple of times again, getting specifics about questions I had about specifics of equipment or adjustments, etc.",1317081600,,1474,4.888
8042236,5,B0006PT29Y,I got this DVD about a week ago and WOW!!!!this guy goes through a lot of information in a quick and easy tutorial. I just started reloading and this DVD is a big help. For the begining reloader it is a must.,1247443200,2,208,3.9761904761904763
8042237,3,B0006PT29Y,"This is a very informative video for those considering reloading their own ammo. It is filmed very well, with step by step instructions, as if you were actually there and the man is talking to you. I recomend if you buy this video also purchase a book as well.  You will also have to check with your local laws as to even being able to reload in your state at all.",1238630400,,364,4.126760563380282
8042238,5,B0006PT29Y,"I had purchased the earlier version of this work, and perhaps, foolishly, I lent that DVD out and never got it back.  I purchased this one to replace it because I don't reload that often, and tend to forget the little things. What I love about this video is that it goes into minute detail about everything.  I'm pretty sure anyone can watch this video and then just start reloading.

I don't recommend that you purchase this video if you already have the earlier version.  There is some new material but not enough to justify a new DVD, unless, like me, you lost the older one.  I thought I might save some money and buy a used one.  There doesn't ever seem to be any used ones available.  The only thing I did find was a DVD rental site that rented reloading DVDs.  And guess which reloading DVD was the highest rated.

The person who 'borrowed' my earlier version was just starting out.  He wanted me to teach him reloading.  Apparently he is reloading all his own ammo now and all I did was 'lend' him this DVD.

So I think you'll understand just why I recommend this.",1221436800,4,1072,4.358585858585859

 IT IS ALL NUTS AND BOLTS STUFF AND HE SHOWS YOU THE COMMON MISTAKES HE MAKES, BUT NO HUMOR NO NOTHING, TO BREAK UP THE DRONE OF HIS VOICE. FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING THOSE MOVIES IN HEALTH CLASS IF YOUR OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT I MEAN.",1216684800,,525,3.8878504672897196
