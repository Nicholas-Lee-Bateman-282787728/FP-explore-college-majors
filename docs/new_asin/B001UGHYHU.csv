8343609,4,B001UGHYHU,"I bought this fight just for gatti ward 1. Arguably the best fight in boxing history. The DVD has the fight but the downside is it doesn't have the 60seconds In between rounds where we here the trainers and comentators. It skips to the beginning of the next round at the end of each round. But aside from that, good quality and amazing fight! This DVD is worth purchasing just for gatti vs ward! RIP Emanuel Steward.",1352937600,2,416,4.415584415584416
8343610,5,B001UGHYHU,This is one of the best Grandes peleas dvds you can buy with 3 of the most action packed fights in history. I have always been a Roberto Duran fan. He won the lightweight tittle the same year i was born and i followed his career through out my youth and early adulthood. I was seventeen when he captured the middleweight crown and can remember being on the edge of my seat watching him fight Iran Barkley who had just demolished the great Tommy Hearns with one punch. You couldn't ask for a more exciting fight. The Aaron Pryor vs Alexis Arguello fight and the Micky Ward vs Arturo Gatti fight(the first of each series.) are also included. All three fights are epic see saw battles that should be a study in courage and determination. This dvd is well worth the money. As a matter of fact they almost give this dvd away as i only paid $10.00. I couldn't be more happy with this dvd. I wish they left the ring introductions and cornerwork in however. All fights are in English.,1342742400,2,976,4.368131868131868
8343611,2,B001UGHYHU,They are great fights videos but the quality of the videos themselves are at best standard. Definately worth having to remember those great fights when boxers really have pride of their skills,1329436800,,192,5.03125

- Aaron Pryor vs. Alexis Arguello (November 12, 1982)

Classy versus cocky. Boxer versus brawler. Good versus Evil. There was no feeling out process in this fight, and you can thank Energizer bunny Aaron Pryor for that. The combustible first round would herald a classic in the making as Pryor from jump took Arguello out of his comfort zone. The ""Explosive Thin Man"" was given no room to breathe as ""the Hawk"" whaled away, which then forced Arguello to whale away back. And maybe just an inch of composure from this normally very composed fighter was whittled away in that first round.

This bout featured furious exchanges and constantly shifting momentum. Because while Arguello may have been rendered out of sorts by Pryor's perpetual motion and offensive salvos, he did manage to adjust and get his own licks in. These two cats took turns hurting each other, took turns imposing their will on each other. In Round 12, only Aaron Pryor and God know how he stood up to Arguello's devastating right hands. Ultimately, Pryor had the measure of Arguello, putting it on him with his frenetic pace, with his ability to take shots, and his own heavy artillery. Round 14 would spell doom for Arguello, as Pryor teed off on an Arguello who lay helpless against the ropes, compelling the referee to step in and stop the thing. In a battle between Good and Evil, I guess Evil won that day. Heck, Evil would also win the rematch.

- Roberto Duran vs. Iran Barkley (February 24, 1989)

Oh, there was bad blood leading up to this fight. Bad blood from Iran ""the Blade"" Barkley for the dirty tactics Robert Duran employed on his friend Davey Moore. Bad blood from Duran because, well, he's not the nicest person in the world. Mean comes naturally to the dude. This was a middleweight brouhaha, a weight class which hadn't showcased Duran at his best. And, clearly, Iran Barkley was taller, bigger, looked more imposing. Duran, on the other hand, looked a bit puffy.

Startlingly, starting off, the larger-framed Barkley exhibited movement and a good jab and seemed intent on going to the body. But near the end of the first round, a huge Duran right hand wobbled Barkley, and that would only be the inaugural punishing right hand, the first of many. Barkley was undeterred and stayed committed to Duran's ribcage. In Round 7, two crisp Barkley left hooks would stun Duran. Another Barkley left hook in Round 8 would discombobulate the Panamanian bully. It's amazing how Duran was able to withstand what Barkley dished out because Barkley was ferociously trying to wipe that sneer off Duran's face. It's amazing how the bigger, younger man couldn't handle what the older guy brought to the party. Barkley had the busier work rate, but Duran had the sexier punches, not to mention that indomitable sneer. The standout round is the eleventh one as Barkley finally succumbed to one right hand too many and crumpled to the canvas. Still, this bout would go the distance, would end with a split decision, with Manos de Piedra raised in victory, sneer very much intact.

- Micky Ward vs. Arturo Gatti (May 18, 2002)

Atlantic City saw something very special on this night. This was a highly anticipated fisted debate, and one that lived up to its billing. If you haven't ever seen ""Irish"" Micky Ward launch that wicked left hook to the liver, then you're in for a treat, because he lands his Sunday punch several times, to Arturo Gatti's discontent. It's one of the most debilitating punches I've ever seen in the past twenty years. You have to be some kind of stud to stand up to it. ""Thunder"" Gatti happens to be such a stud. What a classic friggin' fight this was! It reduced ringside commentator Emanuel Stewart into ooohing and aaahing like an excited little girl.

Arturo Gatti had more in the toolbox. He had Ward on talent and speed. But they were absolute peers when it came to heart and will. Judging solely on skills set, this should've been a walk in the park for Gatti. But then you have to factor in Gatti's one bad ring habit, bad for him, fantastic for us. Gatti can box pretty well... up until you land something significant on him, at which point his machismo surfaces and Gatti dispenses with fancy boxing and goes toe to toe. Gatti was merrily dancing around Ward, making the Lowell, Mass. native look like silly buggers. But Ward kept crowding Gatti and, in Round 3, three consecutive left body hook specials altered the complexion of the fight, suckered Gatti into standing and trading. ""So much for the boxing,"" rhapsodized Emanuel Stewart. A low blow from Gatti in round 4 had referee Frank Capuccino deducting a point from Gatti, and suddenly the odds began to look better for Micky. In fact, the closing moments of Round 5 were all Micky and his last barrage almost had Gatti down.

Round 9 was absolutely stunning. Ward, numero uno ribcage rattler, finally scored a left hook so murderous that Gatti was forced to take a knee, and the camera did a great job capturing the agony on his face. Somehow, somehow, Gatti got up from that and fought on and even turned the tide for a bit before he punched himself out, at which point Ward mounted another assault. And then Ward got arm weary. It was an amazing give and take; the fighters took turns detonating on each other. Round 9 had Jim Lampley, another ringside commentator, exuberantly yelling, ""C'mon! C'mon! -- C'mon, let's fight!"" The movie THE FIGHTER - which chronicles Micky Ward's life story - pales to fluff when you've seen Ward and Gatti in their first summit meeting, brutal punches sapping the body, the claret flowing, the pride and guts and will to win so evident in both men. In this modern era of boxing, Micky Ward and Arturo Gatti put on one of the two best, most epic contests in the squared circle that I've ever seen. The other, of course, is the 10 rounds of hell and sheer manning up between Diego Corrales and Jose Luis Castillo. Corrales and Castillo and all the fighters on this DVD, damn but they humble a fight fan like me.",1301097600,7,6397,4.698483496877787
