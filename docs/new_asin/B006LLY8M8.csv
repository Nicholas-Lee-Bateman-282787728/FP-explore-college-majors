5003495,4,B006LLY8M8,"I have watched a lot of anime and found this anime new and refreshing.  I loved the art style and the characters were intriguing.  The characters play off one another well and the dream world plot was done well.  The story hints at Merry's background but doesn't flesh it out, also the series kinda leaves you hanging with the big bad and what he is up to, hopefully there is a sequel and more is revealed.",1340928000,,406,4.315789473684211
5003496,4,B006LLY8M8,"This series was another one I had to go back and check back out. When this haoppens it doesn't mean the series was bad, but it just means it didn't really ""grab"" me that much. I really hate doing reviews on series that don't really impress me as I feel each items deserves a recent and fair review. This again isn't a bad series it just didn't get to me like some I've watched. It's aonther one of those that I had to look at again to write this and that in itself means that it didn't ""stand out"" as one I really got into.",1338249600,,523,3.9904761904761905
5003497,4,B006LLY8M8,"Dream Eater Merry reminds me of Soul Eater in its visual approach especially with the dream demons and how each has their own unique dream world seperate from all others.  The story is pretty solid and the chacaters are given enough development. The show balances the action and drama pretty well and it doesn't waste time on throw-away episodes save for one beach episode, but even there the story is advanced at least somewhat.  There really isn't much of any romantic development between the lead male character and Merry, but the opening sequence of the episodes suggest that there is some past connection between the two.  While there is some comedy, the show is actually quite dark especially with what can happen to humans who have made pacts with dream demons.

Where the show falls short is that at 13 episodes, it only feels like a warm-up for a bigger story arc.  A much bigger and badder dream demon, Pharos Heracles, with plans to take over the real world is introduced, but the show ends before the story of how Merry and her allies plan to combat him has a chance to begin.

Definitley worth a look, but unless a second season appears, it will ultimatley feel incomplete.",1336003200,7,1186,4.677884615384615
5003498,3,B006LLY8M8,"For a series that was animated by J.C.Staff, I was surprised I could not find a single breast jiggling anywhere. Most of the females in this anime are conservatively flat. That was a nice change of pace. If you are in the habit of watching anime in Japanese, you may take notice that a majority of the main cast comprise of voice actors one would normally see star in side-character roles. If you keep up with ""doujin music"" you may also notice the opening theme is from a singer/songwriter team who not too long ago only sold their music on self-published CDs at comic events. Essentially, the entire anime plays out like an indie flick; and in that respect this anime is actually worth buying. However, what this anime really failed at was depth, despite the overall tone of the show and the somewhat Freudian leap into dreams.

I admit the only reason I watched this series in its entirety was because the main heroine, Merry, is sort of cute. However, she is a bit dim; and while for most anime this would be a redeeming quality, this particular theme involving abstract ideas turned concrete dreams, the character's lack of rationale become annoying and time consuming. Considering you can't fast forward through all the crap without missing out on the all important character development... Actually I don't recall any of that.

Merry is about as useless as they come. She doesn't use many of the tools available to her, such as say, the main character's eyes which should be able to discern a nearby Muma. Practically every other episode features someone's hope and dreams being slaughtered while Merry is within shouting distance; but of course she is absent every time, except when she's duly unnecessary. Every episode shows her crying, self-reflecting, or otherwise conflicted in some way continuing her useless existence the only way she knows how: by doing nothing.

Merry fails to save a single soul in thirteen episodes. If  Merry had a backbone she'd have beat all the bad guys by episode five and allowed me three hours of sleep, but she's too busy dealing with inner conflict to resolve any actual conflicts. So what good is she? She can't beat bad guys, she can't save good guys, she can't cook or clean, she can't wait on tables, and hell, she can't go four minutes without doing something stupid.

I would personally recommend just borrowing this series from a friend, and avoiding the hassle of having to pay for it.",1329782400,17,2438,4.767772511848341
5003499,5,B006LLY8M8,"It needs a second or third season.

Yumekui Merry as a series gives a very strong showing. It takes place in dreams where supernatural beings dubbed dream demons either help people reach their dreams in life, or form a more parasitic bond to take control of their lives. There is more than one antagonist and plenty of action to accompany them. There is also some real moral questions brought up when dealing with these dream creatures.

Merry herself is the exception, she comes from the dream world and is manifested as a real girl in ours. But she wants to go home. The main character on the other hand has the ability to see if people will have a bad dream, as well as if they have a monster attached to them. Together they confront these monsters in their journey to find a way to send her home. I won't spoil the story more than that. The series picks up and doesn't let you go even into the last episode. But if you are looking for some real solutions to questions that arise in this series, don't hold your breath. The series has enough energy to be a 24+ episode saga, but sadly it only received a short 13 episode run.

Hopefully, Merry gets greenlighted for a second season and beyond. It really needs it. The ending won't bug you as much Sacred Blacksmith's, but you will wish there had been more episodes. Still, its a great series, lot of potential. Enjoy it!",1328054400,18,1373,4.4189723320158105

5003504,5,B006LLY8M8,I really like this show. I hope that a second season is made once the manga is completed. The series is really good if a tiny bit confusing and leaves off a lot of loose ends because the anime leaves off about a third of the way through the manga series and the details are explained in them. The dubbing is really well done as well.,1359936000,,333,4.0606060606060606
5003505,4,B006LLY8M8,"I originally bought this for my friend, but hes over seas, so I wound up watching it. Great show, shipped well, no broken casing, or scratches on the disk. I thank you for such a nice thing~ as does my friend.",1351555200,,209,4.121951219512195
5003506,4,B006LLY8M8,"I loved the art style. The teacher is just a bully lol. The story was very interesting, but it was kinda short. Who knows when the next season will be shown. If you like this then you might like Angel beats. It's kinda the same thing as this but a weird view",1351382400,,258,3.980769230769231
5003507,5,B006LLY8M8,Dream Eater Merry surpassed my expectations by incredible margins!  I truly enjoyed the story line as well as each of the characters!  It is an exceptional anime!  I would really reccommend to anyone that have not seen it to get it!,1348963200,,232,4.609756097560975
5003508,5,B006LLY8M8,"Really good version of the classic Japanese Ghost tradition type stories... in a series.  Merry is a very interesting character and the story line is well written.
This is good anime, no need for fan service! The story stands on its own merits.",1345593600,,244,4.674418604651163

8500383,2,B006LLY8M8,"This anime adaptation of a great manga came out pretty terrible.  The music felt... inappropriate, and the drawn out pacing was wrong on some deep level.  The animators were clearly talented, but it seemed their skills were stretched too thin.",1396742400,,243,5.05
8500384,4,B006LLY8M8,"This is a decent series, I just wish they would come out with a second season.... The story is good but they crammed it all into 12 episodes and kinda leave you with a cliffhanger. The art and dub however is really good, no fanservice either. If you are into good art and a slightly different story, this would be a good purchase. I'm definitely not regretting it, but I would really like a second season.",1391558400,,405,4.342105263157895
8500385,1,B006LLY8M8,First time I have had this happen but this will not play unless your Bluray player is connected to the Internet.  I use my PS3 as my player and it would not allow Thai to be payed without my being connected to the internet. Kept getting error saying. Needs do be connected to the Internet so it could verify ownership.........never even saw the show I was so disgusted with how this was released to us consumers,1390608000,,411,4.407894736842105
