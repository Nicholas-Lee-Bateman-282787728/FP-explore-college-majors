8690064,3,B00Q2CZDES,It has a lot to do with the cities of Oslo And Bergen at the ends of the line and not enough about the tracks and landscape in between. I rode the line between Bergen and Oslo in 2003.  I was especially impressed by the tunnels east of Bergen.  I also liked travelling in the snow covered mountains in the middle of May.  I was also surprised that the landscapes when whe approached Oslo were a lot like the landscapes of my native Wisconsin.,1497484800,,442,4.238095238095238
