8473936,4,B005HWAOMA,"This is one live archive DVD that I never expected to see dug up or even more so exiting. Viewer gets to experience three performances by the Third Ear Band that was taped at a show on September 11, 1970. Thoroughly enjoyed the live segment of ""In D"" (6:30) as the sound and picture quality is 100% pristine. The intricately played ""Hyde Park"" (8:14) is also good to check out as is ""David Grouching"" (15:09). Assumed personnel: Paul Minns - oboe, Richard Coff - violin, Denim Bridges - guitar & vocals, Paul Buckmaster - bass and Glen Sweeney - percussion. Recommended for fans of Robert Fripp, Soft Machine, Soft Machine and maybe Hugh Hopper. Notably, the 'Lost Broadcasts' DVD series has a number of other similar titles out as such.",1393977600,,737,4.676923076923077
8473937,5,B005HWAOMA,"The Lost Broadcasts is a dvd series of rare live performances by a variety of progressive bands.  this was taken from a television broadcast in 1970.  three songs totalling about thirty minutes of music.  the sound and picture quality is excellent.  being the 70s, some of the video feedback, and bluescreen effects are cheesy, but it's the performances that are key.  third ear band was very experimental, combining jazz, rock, third-world and electronics all rolled into one.  their vast range of styles remind me of the german band Embryo.  i believe two of these tracks were from their first release ""alchemy.""  all told, if you are into third ear band, this is a must own.  it's great to see these talented musicians live.",1365120000,4,727,4.845528455284553
