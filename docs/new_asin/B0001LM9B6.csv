In another worthwhile segment Arthur Ashe teaches his footwork and body warm-up techniques for loosening up prior to competitive play. This volume is the most compact clinic by top-10 American tennis players I have seen in the classic orthodox strokes that guaranteed a lifetime of play for tennis enthusiasts, injury-free. For teaching pros, this is a great refresher course. All levels of players can benefit from this clinic of advanced essentials.",1422489600,,1077,5.7375
