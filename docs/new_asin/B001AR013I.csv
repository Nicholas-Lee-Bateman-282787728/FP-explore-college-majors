I would recommend.  I got a great deal!  Thanks.

3465670,4,B001AR013I,"This DVD is for TAPS fans only. If you're expecting non-stop paranormal action, this isn't the DVD to buy. This probably isn't a DVD that you're going to want to spend an entire evening watching. Even after being edited in about 1/2 from the original live show, nothing much happens for most of the show. I find this a good DVD to put on when I need something on in the background while working in my office. If you've seen the latest 2008 live show, there is a lot of controversy whether or not stuff was staged that night. During this live show, not nearly as much happens.",1227139200,,575,4.333333333333333

3465672,3,B001AR013I,"I'm a very big fan of Ghosthunters, but this is not one of the better shows. I'm from Louisville Ky, and have been to Waverly Hill several times. I have no doubt the place is haunted, but nothing was really caught in this episode. Season one is the best bet if you want a good purchase.",1222992000,,286,4.125
3465673,2,B001AR013I,"This DVD contains the 3-hour version of the Halloween special (which was originally broadcast on the SciFi channel as a 6-hour special).  As someone here has already noted, it's best to watch this (hopefully you bought it used or borrowed it) while occupied with doing something else; it makes nice ""background"" chatter while you're paying your bills, surfing online, etc.  There's very little to watch in the 3 hours and not much to be scared by on this DVD.  There is much more humor that happens than is typically shown on the 1-hour long episodes but I'm not sure it's worth the time (or money) to see that here.  I also found the ""logo"" for this episode to be distracting; it was at the top left of the screen and much too big and bright, spoiling the atmosphere until you get used to it.  I am a big fan of the weekly program, but this one was really boring.  Remember:  If you saw the Sanatorium on the episode from Season 3 Part 2, then you've already seen the best from this location!",1222041600,10,993,4.423076923076923
3465674,5,B001AR013I,"Not much happens, or at least not much is seen on screen, although personal experiences abound (as well as a shrieking guest star taking off at a run).  Part of the fun is that very minor things are inflated by the hunters into something supernatural.  You do hear odd sounds in old buildings, and things do clatter to the floor when someone walks past an ""empty"" room.  It happens (gravity, rodents, gusts of wind, shaking of floorboards).  There's no attempt at debunking (which is true of the more recent seasons of the show as well).  A lot is made of a rubber ball that rolls along a hallway, yet the team doesn't determine if perhaps the old floor is slanted or sagging.  Or when the ball wobbles in front of the camera, the team vows that there is no wind or breeze affecting the ball -- but no one is at floor level taking measurements.  It becomes a little laughable at this point!  More so the guest star, an ECW wrestler from one of SciFi channel's other shows (just like last year's Halloween special). He's not particularly eloquent at describing his experiences but does seem to see a lot of ghosts.  Towards the end of this show, the three runners up for the next ghost hunter team member are brought in, and you get to see Heather and Krysten acting very nasty towards one of them (I think these are the two women who use the hokey dowsing rods during investigations).  Later on, Krysten and Steve get critical of the runners up, kind of showing off at how much they know in comparison to these contestants, who are all novices (like new people wouldn't be novices? Duh?).  I found these portions of the show quite rude -- and not much to do with ghost hunting.  Though they need some smart women on the team, a rather dull guy is picked to win the contest.  That was disappointing. I miss Paula, the brainy scientist from season one, and Brian's enthusiasm, energy and outspokenness!  Still, the three hours are very entertaining.  I'd like to see the action that SciFi didn't show due to commercials, stretching out to the full six hours of the investigation.  Also, it would be great to see a true scientific investigation, but despite claims to be doing so, I see little equipment and no one with a science background.  The show and the Ghost Hunters team just come off as entertainers -- fun but no substance.  They should admit that what they do isn't science but just TV entertainment.  Highly recommend this DVD, though.  It's a good quality and the action holds your interest.  Looking forward to this year's Halloween special (bet that the guest star will be yet another ECW wrestler).",1221523200,6,2611,4.584051724137931
3465675,3,B001AR013I,"I assume people get a bad dvd and return it to the store and it is later resold as used.  My copy broke down into squares and was unwatchable for large parts.  Also, they should have played up on the great atmosphere, history and architecture at Waverly more.  But it was still a good way to pass an evening, if you need to catch up on the laundry or dusting.  (In retrospect, I'd bump this to four stars.  I'm not a believer, but it's fun to watch.)  I guess we can all only have one Season One in life...  (Plus, you get to see Jason and Grant traverse the ""Death Tunnel"" at midninght on Halloween.  I probably wouldn't do that alone, no matter how sceptical I was... ;)",1221350400,3,672,4.1953125
3465676,3,B001AR013I,"The team ventures into their second live show. This time at the Waverly Hills Sanitorium. Knowing the history of this place, the numerous shows that have been done on it and the teams first experience there, you would think that you would be in for a very interesting show. Once again, as with the Stanley Hotel special, it fell short of the shows usual intrigue. Perhaps live shows aren't the way to go for them. Perhaps its the 3 hour length of the specials that weaken them. If nothing happens during an investigation on the regular show, you understand that it happens, you except it and you still feel it was an interesting adventure. When nothing happens after 3 hours, it's a little less interesting. Most of the things that took place, and the reactions to them, seemed to be an attempt to put some life into the show. For some reason they seem to feel that wrestlers make good guest stars as, once again, that's the way they went. Although this one was better than the last, it still doesn't seem to me to be the best choice. The team, the dynamics and the possibilities of what ""could"" occur will have fans of the show feeling mostly satisfied. True, yet again, it was not the best of shows but, with them, it can never truly be a bad show.",1220832000,8,1250,4.439130434782609

3465698,3,B001AR013I,there wasn't that much activty that you saw them capture on tape.you didn't get to see some of the stuff they saw and since you weren't there you didn't get to feel what they felt. some of the stuff that was heard by them i heard a little but mainly i didn't really hear anything ether.i did see a few things though and i liked being able to see some. in parts it reminded me of a scary movie and just waiting for the bad guy to jump out.there was one funny thing that happened with the big wrestler dude in this at the end of the investigation.i don't blame him though if it had happened to me id of done the same.still pretty good. i have seen this show before and i saw the episode they explored this place before so i know stuff is there and i do belive they felt and saw stuff. its just hard since not all of them had cameras looking in all the directions cuse alot of the time the camera man was focusing on them and not looking where they were looking. anyway still ok,1301702400,,975,4.05699481865285

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

My son said he experienced the child ghost ""Timmy"" pulling covers off them as they were sleeping (verified by video), heard children laughing, and a bed was turned over.

Those two women, who have NO ghost hunting investigational skills AT ALL were so nasty and condescending to a guy named Patrick. As far as I am concerned they RUINED this whole episode. I would hope that Jason and Grant reprimanded them for their behavior and they will never be seen on TAPS again.
Heather and Kristyn can take their ""diving"" rods and never be seen again.
