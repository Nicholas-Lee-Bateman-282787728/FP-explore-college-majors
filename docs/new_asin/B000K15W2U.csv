8153782,5,B000K15W2U,"This is a very watchable story about a toddler that died when the Titanic went down, the boatmen who found the body and their compassion, and modern science in the form of DNA research.
It is a very touching story, a sad story but ultimately an amazing one about how scientists in the 21st century gave an unknown in a cemetary in Nova Scotia a name...over 80 years after his death.
Definitely worth renting or purchasing.",1223337600,2,422,4.565789473684211
8153783,4,B000K15W2U,"Well done documentary on the unknown child.  However, they mis-identified him.  ""Titanic Canada"" does properly identify the child and goes in depth into what was happening in Halifax during the recovery effort.
