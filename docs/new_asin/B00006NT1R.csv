1787367,5,B00006NT1R,"Another hit series for HBO! I recommend buy this DVD set to anyone who loves the show or has not yet seen it. This is one of the best series ever created for television. It is realistic on it's view of life & everything that goes along with it. You feel like you can relate to one, if not all the characters. This show holds no punches, explores every taboo(or not so taboo) topic you could think of, & gives you everything you could want for a fabulous Sunday night. Can't miss HBO Sunday. It's HBO.",1038355200,4,500,4.21875
1787368,5,B00006NT1R,"Six Feet Under is one of the most original, well-acted, and emotionally powerful shows available on the small screen today.
Give the first season a chance, I guarantee you will laugh and cry with its charming, problematic characters living against the morbid backdrop of the Fisher Funeral Home. Although the show is set in the perpetually sunny Los Angeles, cinematographers of the show still manage to make LA seem gray, drab, and cheerless. This is not to say, however, that this show lacks in entertainment value.
There's always the side of us that secrely relish the misfortunes of others--perhaps it's not so secret, since that is the foundation of most comedies (ever think why we find the Three Stooges--three fully grown men going through public humiliation and suffering--so funny?). Six Feet Under catches onto this, but imbues with such wit and intelligence that it's impossible not to get attached to the wonderful but slightly insane cast of the show (it also doesn't hurt that the three children of the Fisher Family are very attractive, charismatic people!).
Alan Ball, the writer of the critically acclaimed film American Beauty, continues with his superb style of biting sarcasm and social commentary on Six Feet Under.
So give it a chance and enter the morbidly entertaining world of Six Feet Under!",1038355200,17,1318,5.078341013824885

1787414,5,B00006NT1R,I love this show so much. My only issue is the last season and how it just blows through tying all the stories together. I felt a little robbed. +++spoiler alert+++ After Nate dies everything just goes way too fast and end on a what if basis. My least favorite character is Ruth and why did Nate have to turn into such a dick.,1514678400,,326,4.109375
1787415,1,B00006NT1R,"Why are the Jewish producers and Directors so hell bent on shoving Homosexuality, Promiscuity and all the rest of the sordid stuff they serve up  to force the audience to accept the way things are. I am absolutely pro Homosexual couples doing their thing but not in your face...its too over the top and shocking to viewers, thats why I never watch mainstream TV I refuse to be manipulated by Hollywood's repeated  subliminal  attempts at changing Society's idea of what is the in thing by forcing people to accept things they are not ready for,  done with numerous cheap shots. I tend to compare shows with what is actual reality to the couple coming of the plane and running to the nearest broom cupboard in an all out sex Orgy while Planes are taking off and Landing. Not believable! The Story is absurd at every turn with an out of control teenager who drives around in a souped up Hearse as her wheels.again .not believable.

1787442,4,B00006NT1R,"This review is for seasons 1-5.

First, the good stuff, of which there is much.  The acting is universally good, and some of it is great.  The writing is fantastic: sometimes funny, always clever, and the plot developments are brilliant.  Visually the show is extremely well done.  Michael C. Hall in particular is a superb actor and his character seems like a terrific person.  I recommend this show.

Now the bad stuff.  The characters are mostly selfish (though they seem to identify as socialist), irritating and emotionally disturbed.  Most of them are often sleeping around and doing drugs.  They curse so much David Mamet would blush.  We might go from one scene where some characters are sleeping around, another where other characters are doing drugs, and another where other characters are being selfish, irritating and emotionally disturbed.  And they're all cursing.  Constantly.  (If this is how you live, please use protection, consider checking into rehab, and think about broadening your vocabulary.)  The people who work at HBO are more depraved than I realized; it's like they decided to make a version of 30-Something but with degenerate characters that are even more self-absorbed.  It just turned out that the writers and actors were so talented that the show works, even if none of the characters' marriages seem to.",1504915200,,1338,5.096774193548387

1787445,4,B00006NT1R,"Surprisingly poignant. I like to binge watch shows, but had trouble finding one I liked enough. This one does that. It is sweet, sometimes sad, romantic, angry, realistic and enjoyable.
I have one complaint. I know this will make me sound so picky, but why do shows have to put microphones by mouths that are kissing? Nate and his girlfriend make so much noise kissing, I find it gross. You hear breath, spit and everything involved.
Other than these gross sound effects, and the constant blasphemy, it is a fun show. Funny how a show can be so religious and blasphemous at the same time. Wish they would think of other exclamations to use.",1502668800,,640,4.62280701754386

I thought it would be a little ghosty or something, and there are ghosts, but they seem to be there to teach lessons to those who need to come to terms with something.  I love all the characters; the mom reinventing herself after a long marriage that seems to have had her a bit in limbo as far as social development; the daughter who drives a lime green hurst that is total rebel - loving her, she is so beyond her years, the gay brother as he is learning to accept who he is and come out to his family, and the prodigal son who has returned home and picked up a very color girlfriend on the way home (loving her hippi spirit) who has a brother with his own challenges. Its kind of a soap opera with all the twists and turn drama, but these are actual real life comedy and drama...and some that only a funeral home could appreciate.  Its a good show.

1787632,5,B00006NT1R,"This is one of the most transcendently enjoyable, complex, and just plain GOOD works of media I've seen. The acting is subtle and nuanced or extreme and bombastic; whatever is called for when the moment needs it. All of the characters are written with such sympathy and understanding that it's hard to believe I'm not watching a live stream. The shots are framed JUST SO to reveal- or conceal- exactly the right amount of information to make the emotional punches hit home all the harder. AND THERE WILL BE EMOTIONAL PUNCHES. I don't think it's possible to get through this season without feeling... pretty much every emotion at least once. This is grade A storytelling at its finest, in every category.

Regarding the plot, the basic set-up is all handled extremely well early on in the show: The Fisher family runs a funeral home in Los Angeles. When the patriarch dies unexpectedly, his two sons, daughter, and widow must pick up the pieces and figure out how to continue without him. Everything else grows as a result of who the Fishers are and how they interact with the world, and it happens so organically that even while the show builds moment after incredible moment, it never feels staged and you'll never know what to expect next.

The stories are unique and refreshingly uncliched, the acting is absolutely superb. The show is now a bit dated and when it aired it was topical, but almost 95% of it is still valid and relevant. Performances by Peter Krause, Lauren Ambrose and Michael C. Hall will stun you and affect you for a long time after you stop watching. I highly recommend this drama.

It really is fascinating to watch the circus go around, in a can't-take-your-eyes-off-the-train-wreck sort of way. If you're into that sort of thing, I suppose it makes for great entertainment. However, the whole show seems to hang out in a permanent state of existential depression. I thought it would be more of a dark, quirky, Weeds-type drama that focuses more on the whole being-an-undertaker theme. Instead, it is a character drama about dysfunctional relationships and lives that circle the same wagons again and again.",1483747200,,746,5.277310924369748

Hall in DEXTER.....but had no idea that a  secondary theme of  six feet under was included. at no extra charge.  However the storylines about how people deal with death was enlightening and poignant.  I had no idea that ""DEXTER"" was such a multifaceted actor.  Would have been 5 star without secondary storyline.",1481241600,,379,4.859375

1788188,5,B00006NT1R,"Being able to watch the series is what led me to subscribe to Amazon Prime. After watching Dexter I was curious to see one of the lead characters in the earlier series that predated Dexter. Excellent show, very risque for 2001. Only negative is it comes up in the old style box format instead of widescreen.",1481241600,,307,4.5
1788189,3,B00006NT1R,"It must have been an inspired day when the producers of Six Feet Under decided to go ahead with a TV series based on the life of a family running a funeral home. How come no one else thought of it? Well, I for one, think there are good reasons why the funeral genre of film hasn't really made it before. Funereal humor, funereal settings, funereal sitcoms are not at the top of most people's lists. I watched the first episode of Six Feet Under. It wasn't bad, but I have no desire to repeat the experience. 3 stars.",1481241600,,516,4.222222222222222

1788213,5,B00006NT1R,"I'm absolutely hooked from the very first episode.

This show weaves morbid humor into a very heartfelt plot. The major characters' personalities, ideals, issues and fears are explored through episodic arcs featuring people purchasing the funeral home's product. Everything feels very natural, and the added element of hallucinations also spice up the show further.

All in all, Season 1 is a polished gem of many facets. I found myself sympathizing with many of the characters and laughing at how much I love the women of every episode. Seriously. The main female leads rock! Claire began as the adolescent troublemaker but quickly evolves into something more ambiguous and real. The mother is extremely interesting as well due to her rather timid and conservative views. Brenda shines as a character who is shrouded in enigma, someone who is both extremely relatable and perpetually mysterious.

I have fallen for all the characters despite their flaws (which are small). This show perfectly executes the plot without sacrificing character growth, not to mention the top notch cinematography and soundtrack. I'm glad I gave this show a chance, and now onto Season 2!",1481155200,6,1168,5.235294117647059

1788216,2,B00006NT1R,"Tired of having Hollywood push their deviant agenda.  Just because things exist doesn't give license to Hollywood to abrogate their moral responsibility to filter the majority of their films through censors.  The censors must have become very jaded these days and just about anything gets a pass; in this case the homosexual relations of a central figure of the cast.  I know it goes on in real life but it is distasteful and ruined the film for me.  Keep it in the closet, the young shouldn't see it paraded openly.",1481068800,,516,4.7

Each family member has his or her own dramas--grappling with issues of teenage angst, grieving a lost patriarch, coming out as gay, and just figuring out how they fit in the family and family-owned business. While the episodes illustrate the successes and failures of the family, we see the everyday running of a funeral home. A death happens at the beginning of each episode and as we watch, we learn about the deceased person and their complicated life. I like the show very much.

1789106,4,B00006NT1R,I like the concept of the show. I'll have to admit that I watched Dexter first so its been a little difficult to adjust to Michael C Hall's character. For me its a filler show until primetime comes back in the fall and I'm glad I stumbled onto this one,1469318400,,252,4.06

1789128,5,B00006NT1R,In my opinion this is one of the best series in a very long time. The creators broke new ground with some issues that always have been held away. The acting was very good. The one caveat I would give is that it is NOT a family series and deals with adult themes.,1469232000,,262,3.9622641509433962

1789146,3,B00006NT1R,Strangely intriguing. I decided to watch this after watching Dexter because I became a fan of Michael C. Hall. He is a great actor in which he proves he could do anything!  It's got a lot more sex scenes & homosexual sex scenes than I want to see. Some scenes are way too mentally out there but it keeps you watching & overlooking whatever displeases you.,1469232000,,355,4.378787878787879
1789147,4,B00006NT1R,Have only watched the first five episodes so far but am really enjoying the dark humor.,1469145600,,87,4.5
1789148,5,B00006NT1R,I love this show! Wonderful writing and original storyline. I'm definitely hooked and going to continue to watch the entire series. I'm very glad that Amazon has began carrying all of HBO's programming. We never had cable and didn't get to watch the series when it was running. Very glad to have the opportunity now. Michael C Hall and Peter Krause were amazing in this show.  I was familiar with these actors from their later performances and other hit shows. But to be able to look back on their previous work was amazing.,1469145600,,524,4.634408602150538

The main cast is fantastic, and the guests are usually pretty good, too. Every now and then you get a glimpse of how Michael C.

1789818,2,B00006NT1R,"I've heard good reviews of this series for some time, but really had very little idea of what it was about other than in the vaguest sense. Taking an opportunity to sample it, one episode was enough to let me know that it wasn't my cup of tea. The subject matter isn't so offsetting, as I enjoyed the dark humor of ""Dead Like Me"" and watched that whole series. The acting, casting, cinematography, and set pieces of ""Six Feet Under"" are quite good. I just don't care for the writing or story line. I don't laugh. I don't cry. I don't care about anyone. I just seem to get bored or depressed by it all. Life is far too short to watch a show that bores or depresses me. You simply have to really, really like these characters to take on the burden of watching this series. I see nothing else going for it.",1465257600,,803,4.220779220779221

If you are at all the ""queasy"" type and are a little apprehensive about this subject, you might want to stay away.  They do show dead bodies and what they do to them to prepare them for viewing, but they don't get very graphic.  Never the less, the insinuations are there.

With that said, I thought that it was a very funny program and kept me laughing.  It is a dark program, but I am the sort that finds irreverent subjects funny.  Watch one episode and decide for yourself, I'm glad that I did!",1464739200,,698,4.25

When I started season 1 the first thing I noticed was the theme! It is so perfect! As the story kicks off I was reminded at how funny a show about a family in the funeral biz can be when it's this well written.

Another thing that makes this show so great is the way they show you what is going on in the minds of the characters, like in a book. The cast is so awesome every episode is a delight, even when it pushes the comfort zone.",1463788800,,707,4.05

When the first episode started with the tragic death of someone and the follow up to that wondered if I had made the right choice but the writers did a brilliant job of combining the tragic with comic relieve moments. After watching this episode my husband and I where hooked.

The show is very cleverly written and each episode shows you more of the families life and others tragedies while still enabling you to have a laugh.

Started second season just this week and am looking forward to working my way through each one.",1461801600,,668,4.55

1790052,5,B00006NT1R,"Six Feet Under was a pioneer for edgy cable/streaming dramas that are all so common today. It's held up very well and is still fresh and relevant. If you're not familiar with the premise, the central characters are a family that owns a funeral home. Each episode begins with someone's untimely demise, and the show uses that as a springboard to examine many emotional and sociological aspects of death and dying. It certainly caused me to think about a topic many of us like to avoid thinking about.

The other interesting aspect of the series is examining various social issues through the actions of the characters, many of whom are flawed individuals. Their weaknesses are fodder for looking at a lot of topics.

I'm probably making it sound very serious, but the series has a unique, albeit dark humor about it that is entertaining.",1461715200,,836,4.798611111111111

It's difficult to fully explain what this show does to me, but let me just say it's one of the best shows I've had the pleasure to enjoy.  I'm a 46 year old dude who grew up in small town Texas.  I have a younger gay brother.  You should probably be aware there are many homosexual related events happening throughout the show.  Does that make you uncomfortable?  If so, well...maybe this series isn't for you.  I can fully admit I don't ENJOY watching two men kiss, but it doesn't bother me to the point where it makes me not want to watch this.  It's all relevant.  Not excessive.

Just also be aware there is a LOT of death in this show.  Duh right?  Well, every episode starts with someone dying...and sometimes it's a child.  I cried...no, I sobbed, like a blubbering fool.  haha.  Then I laughed.  This show has it all.

The first episode sets the tone for the rest of the season as the patriarch, Nathaniel Fisher Sr., is killed when his hearse is broadsided by a bus. At Christmastime, no less. The prodigal son, Nate, returns home and is sucked back into the family business he tried to escape from long ago. Younger siblings David and Clare have their own demons they wrestle with. And matriarch Ruth has secrets of her own that eventually are revealed. Nate's girlfriend Brenda and her family could have been a spinoff series all on their own - they put the fun is dysfunctional! Each episodes starts off with a death - how else would the Fishers get business? If you have a few hours, I highly recommend a marathon viewing on Amazon Prime!",1457222400,,902,4.715189873417722

1790385,5,B00006NT1R,"I loved this series. I remember when it came on HBO but I didn't have time to watch it. Like reading a novel, I got so involved that every day I'd watch an episode or two until I finished all 5 seasons through my Roku. It's easy to get into the characters who make you smile, make your angry, make you wonder why the heck would he/she say or do that! Then in the next episode you learn something new about each one. I like the artistry in the way each episode starts with the death of a 'customer' and how that is tied into the episode with our main characters. Each one may have a talk with the dead person that depends on what they are experiencing at the time. Sometimes that can be funny and other times very poignant--but always entertaining. It didn't hurt that I learned something about the industry as well,",1454976000,2,815,4.264516129032258

1790426,1,B00006NT1R,Pornography with a story.  Language definitely could be cleaned up since it adds nothing to  the story line which in itself ism't bad.  The writer can't seem to get beyond the F word.  Whoever the writer is needs to get a dictionary and use better choices.  In the bygone years they lead into sexual situations without the act supposedly done as this series likes to leave nothing to the imagination.  Sorry the story had so much negative material.  Again the story idea isn't bad.,1454198400,2,481,4.654761904761905

1790512,5,B00006NT1R,"I'm surprised I hadn't thought to write a review for this show yet. It is truly a one of a kind masterpiece that EVERYONE should watch at least once.

About 10 years ago, I had a membership to Blockbuster and I had pretty much rented everything there was to see in my local store. I started renting random videos that were not my usual go-to's, and Six Feet Under was one of those shows. I had no idea what it was about, but I remember the ambigious cover art had caught my attention a few times and I decided, hey why the heck not? I'll check it out.

And that was the beginning of what felt like a profound journey that opened my eyes to what life is really about. Not that I think I didn't know what life was about already, but most of us are so set in our ways and what we believe is right, that we fail to see the perspective of others. It gave me insight into so many things that we take for granted. All the characters, even the ones you don't like, are extremely relatable. We have all been in one of their situations and can empathize with what the characters are going through or may know someone who is like them. I don't want to babble on and on about how amazing this show is, all I have to say is that you must absolutely give this show an opportunity and keep an open mind and watch it. It is a crazy, spirited,whirlwind of emotions and lessons that anyone can learn a thing or two from. It's like if you died and ""life"" flashed before your eyes... this show is that.

I personally really identified with Claire, as I was about her age when I started watching this the first time. I just rewatched it recently after many years and when I finished watching the ending, I told myself that in another couple of years, I will have to watch this show again. You will just have to see for yourself. There is nothing else out there quite like this show.",1452816000,4,1861,4.178272980501393

1790514,5,B00006NT1R,"This review is for the entire series.  I had always wanted to watch Six Feet Under since it's release, but never had HBO.  I watched and was completely entranced by Dexter and was lost when I had finished the last episode.  After searching for highly rated series, I found that Amazon offered this for free with Prime.  Since I had always wanted to see it and knowing the phenomenal acting Michael C. Hall brings to his roles, I began this series.  I was not disappointed.  This series takes a no holds barred approach to controversial issues and is overall a great series showcasing a family owned funeral home business.  It forces you to get to know and love each character whether it be when they are first introduced to you, or later in the series.  I actually got a bit choked up during the last handful of episodes.  I only wish I had watched it when it originally aired.  It's a great series to binge on and you'll love every episode.",1449878400,,941,4.450292397660819

No one gets out of this life alive and we all know that but seeing this amazing series gives us reason to reflect on it in all kinds of ways, serious and funny.

It is definitely character driven, which allows us to look at and examine the people and what they face every day rather than their line of work. Death is a topic we're not comfortable discussing in our culture, and it's refreshing to see a series where people are dealing with it on a daily basis in addition to living their lives.

It was sad, happy, and even funny. I would not recommend this for all, but if you can see characters come to life, and show you real life lessons then you may appreciate the stories as I did.

This show won many awards so I know I am not the only one to feel so passionate about the story. I wish it were still on, and I can't believe I waited so long to see it, but the final episode wrapped up things to my satisfaction. I will probably watch all the seasons again soon to see what I missed the first time.",1444176000,,658,3.91044776119403

1790827,5,B00006NT1R,"I came late to the game as I did not have HBO while this show was airing, but I made a mental note even back then, that I would get around to watching this amazing show.  I started watching Dexter before I saw this show and now I see the similarities and ideas that came from the character Michael C. Hall plays on the show and the one he plays on Dexter.  Of course, when we like one character (or the actor in that role), we want more of that kind of character and intensity, so I'm not surprised.  Also, the way the deceased father appears by the characters' side and casually shares his opinions and thoughts about things happening in his living son's life is wonderful and a great device to allow viewers a look into the character's thoughts without having them be narrated.  The acting is terrific and while the high school situations are always so exaggerated in most shows, this one included, the daughter is so refreshing and interesting.  The show doesn't feel like an LA-based show, though.  It feels more East Coast.  I have only just begun watching the show, but both episodes I've seen have made me cry.  The grief and heart-wrenching emotions the characters are going through are captured so well.  Glad I finally made it to the game, even if it's been long over for everyone else.",1443398400,5,1296,4.504273504273504

1790882,5,B00006NT1R,Watching the whole run again! The writing is still so solid and even though there's some dated conversations and politics the philosophical aspects are still poignant and thought provoking. The only thing that gets a bit annoying if you are power watching is that the intro is a minute and a half long... tend to fast forward through it.,1442361600,,337,4.728813559322034

1790932,5,B00006NT1R,"I love this show. Its dysfunctional family, its oddball suite of corpses and their grieving families, its many subplots and surprising twists and turns all make it extremely entertaining. What keeps it high on my list is the skillful interweaving of poignancy, mystery, the macabre and laugh-out-loud funny humor.  Having enjoyed Peter Krause as the responsible older brother in Parenthood, it's very fun to see him as the one who struggles with responsibility and far prefers sex, drugs and wild Brenda to manning up at the mortuary.",1441584000,,534,5.137931034482759

I kept watching thinking it would get better because most shows take a little bit to get going, but it never happened. It wasn't ""real"" or ""heartfelt"" or any of the things that many other reviewers stated. I'm really not sure what the appeal of the show is or how so many people have given it 5 stars. Of course, lots of people like Game of Thrones, too, so I guess it's probably that same crowd who don't have enough drama and darkness in their lives and think that watching it somehow makes their own lives more exciting or something.",1440374400,4,636,4.308333333333334

1791035,2,B00006NT1R,I keep expecting this show to get better and it doesn't. Weird combination of serious and almost slap-stick. The portrayal of the mother is most strange - she's meek and/or searching for herself and continues to dabble in odd behavior. I guess that's supposed to be funny. And the gay brother is awfully stereotypical. I'm not going to watch any more of this.,1440374400,2,359,4.714285714285714

It's also addictive - I can't believe I haven't started watching it 12 years ago.  Obviously, it focuses on death (funeral home family business), relationships, love, family, and the many hardships of life, in general.  It is a very different show than anything I've seen on TV.",1440201600,,408,4.690140845070423
1791057,2,B00006NT1R,It was different to say the least.  I didn't like all of the F words.  Frankly the show is kind of pathetic.  I really wouldn't recommend it anyone under 18 years of age and maybe that is a little too young if death bothers you.  I realize we all will have to face it at some point but I feel like they made a joke out of it at times and other times it was rather crass.

Aging, death, family guilt/loyalty/dysfunction/love, teen angst, and corporate greed are just a few of the common issues that surface in every episode.  The characters are all multidimensional.

1791300,5,B00006NT1R,"Years after first watching this series, I was afraid that the show wouldn't hold up to the test of time. Many shows that I have come back to after a decade or more, feel dated and less relevant... but this is not the case with Six Feet Under. The only two things that stuck out were that the first few seasons are sadly only in SD format and some of the clothing (particularly the high school students) is a bit dated to that period.

Most importantly though, the show is a great mix of comedy, tragedy, drama, and honesty. The characters feel very real to me and many of them remind of people in my own life. It definitely gets you thinking about the nature of life and death.",1437436800,,677,4.248062015503876

1791350,5,B00006NT1R,I started watching this because I heard it was good.  I was HOOKED! I watched everyday until I had watched every season. I was so bummed when it was over. If you like dark comedys you will LOVE it! Definitely not for everyone but I have a strange sense of humor I think?  Worth a watch to see if you like it. The casting was superb. The acting and writing left nothing to want for. Even the final episode could not have been more perfect. If it had to end that was the way to go out.,1437177600,,483,3.9690721649484537
1791351,4,B00006NT1R,The show is great. It's not what I was expecting. It can be sad and funny at the same time. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it has not been reformatted to widescreen. If you have an hdtv this means you have the two black strips on the sides. I would normally just adjust my tv but the dog ate the remote.,1437177600,,311,3.8

1791469,2,B00006NT1R,"The technical and creative aspects of this series warrants 4 or 5 stars, as the dialogue, direction, plots, characters, and acting are all very well done.  However, the pervasive drug use and predominant time spent on a main character's homosexual relationships warrants 0 stars for pandering to single issue viewers.  It's a shame for good writing that deals deftly and honestly with a variety of delicate subjects to be dummied down by the constant appeal to base and inherently troublesome self-serving demographics for viewership.  The average of 2 stars of recommendation is what results from the skilled, creative aspects and the business oriented appeal to self-indulgent demographics.
Loved the characters and topics, but felt insulted by the pervasive self-serving appeal to single-issue viewership. Somewhat regretfully, and admittedly reluctant, I chose to stop viewing the series during the second season.",1434672000,,917,5.58273381294964

While the soap opera-ish nature of some of the continuing plot lines may not be to everyone's liking, the acting is well grounded, engaging and bring the characters to life while they work with the dead and grieving.

I'm rewatching the series and it seems to be holding up rather well. Strange how so few societal issues that it dealt with have changed in the decade plus since the initial airings.",1434412800,,610,4.745283018867925

1791537,5,B00006NT1R,"A well-written, thought-provoking series about a family who runs a funeral home, ""Six Feet Under"" gets us involved in the characters, even those we don't initially like.  Each episode begins with a death, but then explores the reactions of both the family of the deceased and the characters who deal with death every day.  It is a tremendously life-affirming series, helping the audience deal with all those often hidden struggles that keep us from fully experiencing life. Adult content warning: the show does have sex, nudity and frequent vulgar language, though they don't dwell at all on the violence of death.",1433721600,,614,5.069306930693069
1791538,5,B00006NT1R,"Great show. A sophisticated blend of sadness, excitement, dark humor, and the occasional whimsical fantasy of the various characters portrayed imaginations.
The acting from the cast is almost always top notch and on par with some of the greatest stage and screen actors of history.  They bring to their characters a certain realism which I often find to be uncannily close to real life and that I can totally relate to...as much as that may frighten me.
If you are interested in a show which is smart, entertaining, and can be completely immersive to a fan with a bit of a dark and cynical side to them, then this is absolutely a recommended show for you.",1433721600,,655,4.646551724137931

1791591,3,B00006NT1R,"A darkly morbid storyline dealing with death and centers around  the family that runs a funeral home.  Keeping it from getting too morbid they use a quirky dark sense of humor that lifts this series. .The stories are interesting and caught me off guard, and making me return to see the next.  Definitely Adult fare,  nothing is written out ;  homosexuality, sex, death scenes, etc. .  I hear that the first 3 yrs are excellent, but expect to be disappointed with the downfall after with the 4th yr. My friends were correct, it was quality HBO series at the start and worth watching, just be warned about explicit language .IMDB rates it very high.",1431993600,,647,4.631578947368421

You get interesting, but very real characters, amazing acting, interesting plots all with a procedural twist (I love that each episode starts with a death - trust me when I say it is so much more evolved than your standard procedural opening). This is one of the rare times that I really fell in love with the characters, their stories, joys and sadness.  It's the only series where I've gone back to watch again a couple of years after the series finale.

If the first season is any indication all of those claims are well-met. It can give you tears of laughter and tears of sadness within the same episode. That speaks volumes. Heartwarming and heartbreaking. Brenda is one of the most fascinatingly complex characters I believe I have ever seen in media. They're all complex and interesting character. I actually care what happens to these people. They all have their own fears, desires, and motivations. It's just a very well written and acted series. Well worth the watch. Well worth the wait.

1. Eureka
2. Warehouse 13

6. Sons of Anarchy
7. Farscape

Honorable Mention: Dexter

Now let's look at some real bad ones:

1. Six Feet Under
2. Six Feet Under
3. Six Feet Under

This show had sex where it didn't need to be, dialogue where it didn't need to be, strange off-shoots of the story right in the middle of the story (totally unnecessary), and a VERY thin story line, to boot. (That might be the reason for the stupid, meaningless off-shoots). I gave it an honest chance, but it never made much sense. Stranger than all this is how it lasted five entire seasons. NOT Recommended!

By the way, I gave it an extra star for a bit of nice camera work, but there was no discernible plot to back it up so ...",1427500800,,796,4.169934640522876

Having a funeral director in my family, we all have inside joes but this is enlightening.  I love it.  The family personalities, individual lives, and how things fit in is weirdly insightful and I can't wait to get home to continue watching.

The Mother is Great.  Controlling, smothering anyone that comes within her reach while trying to fill the void of losing her husband.  But, when she steps out of her comfort zone, her life begins.  It's great!!",1427414400,,541,4.8791208791208796

1791949,4,B00006NT1R,"Overall interesting story line with interesting characters. At times the daughter's store line seems pointless. The mom is so funny. Dry sense of humor and very literal. They do tap into the homosexual agenda (one of the son's is gay) every single episode so that may or may not be an issue depending on who you are. The series started off with focusing on the funeral home duties and dead bodies but soon ventured out to stories outside the funeral home. Not expected, but it's fine. I guess there's but so much that can newly happen in the funeral home.",1426636800,,555,4.56

The mother is in denial. The oldest son hates the family business and is in a dead end job when he meets a wild, adventurous mentally unstable but intellectual woman. Second son is taking care of the business and has issues of his own.  The artistic free spirited and independent youngest daughter enrolls in art school which is well portrayed (I went to art school, I should know)....For mature and (thinking) audiences. Contemporary issues are IN YOUR FACE. HBO strikes again with a winning program.",1426636800,,674,5.127272727272727

1792130,5,B00006NT1R,"I'm hooked. I have never been a HBO subscriber, and am now a broadband only video viewer so I come to SIX FEET UNDER late. All the greater treat. The characters are compelling and draw this viewer into their world that includes a considerable gay component inasmuch as one of the principal family members is gay. Season one strikes an effective balance with humor that is less evident in Season 2. Its a challenge being effectively comic when the heart of the subject is a Funeral Home and the constant theme of death. I hope it continues as I binge my way through the remaining seasons.",1425081600,,587,4.547169811320755

1792135,5,B00006NT1R,"This series gets deeper and deeper with each episode. I was not hooked until the 3rd one, and none of the subsequent episodes have disappointed. It is the story of several complicated people who happen to be related to one another (mostly) and who are engaged in a very complex enterprise, the funeral business. Each episode begins with a death, usually something tragic and/or bizarre. And that story is cleverly woven into the lives of the main characters. The inclusion of the ghost of the recently deceased funeral director into the private moments of his family members is one of the best elements of the show. I am nearly through the first season and care so much about them all. I so much want David to get back together with Keith. I love Claire and her adolescent intensities. I agonize along with Brenda and Nate as they love and hate. I want the unlikable Ruth to be happier and am pretty sure she never will be. And, of course, I want Rico to stay with the family. He is the sanest person in the whole crazy place. The opening music with the suggestion of the bell tolling for thee is now burned into my brain. The best series theme I can recall.  And the acting. It is extraordinary and I am sure I will watch this again just to get more of it. I hope all the people involved in making this show realize what a great job they did.",1425081600,,1343,4.372

All members of the family have secrets and their own lives. The family business is running a funeral home in their own home.

This is a highly adult show with full frontal (male) nudity and sexual scenes so be prepared in case you have problems dealing with things like that.

There were definitely some good moments, but the overall (potentially truly interesting) story lines were just not realized.  The director/producers go way overboard in looking for the shock value of almost every situation.
Subtlety  is not in their vocabulary.

1792233,5,B00006NT1R,"A dynamic--and quirky--look at a dysfunctional but well-meaning family which happens to be in the business of dealing with death. Superbly acted, well-written, and well directed, in spite of there being a wide variety of different directors. While death (mortuary) is the unifying factor among all the episodes, it is by no means the only issue examined.

The characters are well-developed and multifaceted. It seems that the characters peripheral to the family, and inter-acting with them, are also deeply flawed or dysfunctional, both likeable and disturbing at the same time.",1424390400,,578,5.4222222222222225

1792286,2,B00006NT1R,"I expected more from this once popular series.  The first few episodes were entertaining as the viewer got to know the main characters. But, as time went on, the storylines focused much more on the ""miserable"" deeply flawed personalities living in the funeral home, rather than the issues surrounding the ""dead body"" of the week.  Plenty of gay sex (...not that there is anything wrong with that...[Seinfeld]).  You eventually begin to loathe some of the characters just for acting so stupidly in their daily lives.  It's pretty bad when my favorite character, with just a minor role, is the Puerto Rican make-up artist that performs miracles on even the most damaged corpses.  The main character, Michael C. Hall, is much better in a subsequent HBO series called Dexter.",1424390400,,771,4.9921875

1792565,5,B00006NT1R,"It's fitting that my first logged order from Amazon (back at the tail end of 2008) was for a television show that arguably redefined the episodic drama landscape. I was a couple of years removed from my last viewing of the series ""Six Feet Under"", and had been lucky enough to catch up on the whole series in streaming form while the 5th season was wrapping up in 2005 (via my premium cable TV subscription--""Comcast On Demand"", before it changed its' name to whatever it is today). ""Six Feet Under"" is a strange series to champion so strongly. The story lines and circumstances were not unusual enough to garner the same level of attention that shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex And The City"" had gotten. Yet, this first season feels tied spiritually to Alan Ball's movie ""American Beauty"", a movie I had quite enjoyed back at the end of 1999. Timing and space are everything in shows like these, and the first season establishes the transitional nature of each character in the midst of losing the familial patriarch, in Nate Fisher Sr.

I first watched the show with a (now ex-) girlfriend of mine, initially out of sheer curiosity for an HBO series to enjoy besides ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". At the time, our relationship was strained due to several factors that we could easily both take responsibility for. She and I had lost a prematurely born son the year prior, and had been working together (and apart) to try to glue the pieces back together, without taking stock of what we had lost for each other along the way. And there were some unspoken parallels that we could connect with within this series, moments and interactions with the bereaved that she and I had felt ourselves, or that we related to. The pilot episode, and the first several episodes, does a wonderful job of introducing the Fisher family, in spite of Nate Sr.'s sudden and violent death in a car accident (in a hearse, no less). And, in spite of that, there was humor and charm in the disjointed interactions the characters made with each other:

""Your father is dead...and my pot roast is ruined.""

Although the relationship ended a couple of months after the series finale, I always held ""Six Feet Under"" very close to my heart. In the next couple of years, I would occasionally binge-watch syndicated episodes that played on Bravo weekday mornings, or would try to remember exactly how the story advanced through the different seasons. A couple of years after losing my son, my mother got brain and lung cancer and lived for several months (with pride and confidence) before succumbing to her illness. After she died, one of my coping mechanisms was revisiting this series (especially Season 4's hospice care narrative with Nate Jr.). Even though she never watched it, I'm sure she would have loved the show. It has weaved its' way in and out of my life in the years since; somehow I can find time to binge watch it once a year without tiring of the weaknesses in the storytelling (of which there are few).

What more can be said about ""Six Feet Under"" that isn't already commonly known? This season was shot in full-screen ratio, further reminding you how quickly we are removed from the previous generation of television broadcasting. But shows do not survive on resolution or display format alone. The writing, cinematography, and acting need to stand on its' own. These characters pull you into their world, and make you believe the family ties are strong between them.

""Six Feet Under"" is a gift for those who can relate to growing up, dealing with the death of loved ones (and the birth of new love and life), and the strength of a family.",1420070400,,3627,4.696540880503145

I wish the writers could have maintained that touch of lightness a midst the devolution of these memorable characters and their miserable lives (and deaths). I cared about what happened to these people, which means the acting and writing was very good. It's just that I got a bit tired of everything being so darned depressing. I know, I know. It's a series about death and a funeral home, but the whole idea is a goldmine for humor if you try just a little (as they did in the first season).",1418688000,,600,4.271929824561403

1793188,4,B00006NT1R,very funny and macabre series. Don't like the emphasis on the man to man relationships and explicit scenes so I took one star for that.

1793287,5,B00006NT1R,"This review is for the streaming version of the series overall, not the DVDs. No spoilers! I describe the appeal in general here.

The first few episodes didn't grab me completely, but by the 4th, I was utterly hooked. This is one of the rare shows you'll find with well developed, complex characters that change in incremental ways throughout the series. I think that's what makes the show work so well as you watch; it explores the complexity of being human and having human relationships of every kind.

While the obvious theme here is death because of where it is set, I would say the meta theme is vulnerability. Life is a series of small deaths as we grow and change within and with those we love in our families, friendships, and with our romantic partners. While one of the key characters is afraid of death in a more literal sense, all are often at odds with those small deaths that lead to change and how it often means being vulnerable with those they love. For this reason, I appreciated that the fade between scenes was the same as the fade for each death at the beginning of (most) episodes.

I've seen some say they found this show depressing, but it was quite the opposite for me. While life is certainly punctuated by its most painful moments, there are so many moments of joy between that tie it all together. The humor in it was dark at times, but it is genuine belly-laugh funny.

If you watch it to the end the final episode is one of the most moving I've ever experienced, especially in last montage. I'm one of those stoic people that never cries at a movie or show, but I wept like crazy. It gave me so much to reflect on about life, that I didn't feel like streaming another show or even music for the rest of the day.

Given all of the above and particularly the way it made me reflective, I'd say this is one of the rare shows that goes beyond being filler or background noise. It is likely to make most people think and feel and perhaps even grow a bit in the process.",1417478400,,1996,4.354838709677419

1793374,5,B00006NT1R,"It has been called, ""One of the Greatest TV shows ever made"" and it doesn't take much viewing to see why. Once you get a peak behind the iron curtain, you'll see a world for the first time through the eyes of the Fisher family as they navigate through life. This show follows to very basic structures, life and death. Beginning of every episode we areintroduced to a new character before watching them die. The violence is not as bad as people make it out to be. The violence is justified. The world is a dark place and we often rather pretend thing that things are not so gritty.  People want to turn on the TV and forget about death, diseases and whatever else frightens them. This show may not be for you but for me, this taught me not to be afraid of death. I'm not saying I embrace the idea of dying. I'm just more comfortable with the subject. I don't fear death every waking moment. This show is HBO saying ""you're all gonna someday"" as every episode is a disturbing reminder of that. As much as it is show about death, it's also a beautiful tribute to life. I thank HBO for bringing Death into the spotlight.",1417219200,,1116,4.314285714285714

They help people at the worst time in their lives, but now the tables have turned. The series starts out very strongly in season one, and gets even better. Every episode begins with a death that sets the tone. The deaths are not gorey, however, there are two instances where children die.

1793496,4,B00006NT1R,"The basic idea of a family-owned funeral business is an interesting one. Of which, the topic of death is pretty thoroughly explored from the perspective of a family that, not only deals with it on a daily basis, but who also recently experienced it on a personal level.  The writers realize the main characters inner-most fears and desires through imagery  of the reincarnated dead now in their care. And  brought back to life through the power of their imagination with their recently-deceased father making regular appearances.

Overall I've been enjoying the series so far, accepting the fact that the writers have done a fair job at not make the characters seem overly-dramatic or trite; which, in a series with lots of dialog, is very difficult to do. The inclusion of gay themes, while not necessarily a good or bad thing, in my opinion, might seem like a breath of fresh air for anyone with repressed homosexual feelings themselves or just enjoys a good gay underdog story. It does, however, add an additional dimension of interested if you don't mind the occasional man-to-man contact of and about the face and lips.",1416355200,,1124,4.9

Simply put it is well acted, thought provoking and genuinely unique. And I think we can all agree that the one thing that's hard to find is that really new thing in TV land, Six Feet Under is a first of its kind for sure. I became riveted to the show and binged night after night, there isn't a bad episode in the lot.

I love the variety of personalities and find myself caring about them.  As each member of the Fisher family helps the grieving families, they're dealing with their own challenges.  The series starts with the death of the father - the owner of the funeral home.  I love how he ""visits"" the family he left behind.  I love the secrets each family member holds and how they come out.

The cast is very talented, and their performances were strong and believable. The woman who played the mother was OUTSTANDING! She caught my attention in every scene in which she played. It's no wonder, because she's an accomplished actress who graduated from Julliard (according to IMDb). The strength of this series, besides the great acting, is the writers' exploration of family dynamics, loyalty, heartbreak, and love.

I fault the writers for one thing: I didn't like that the characters almost all thought about or fell into sexual experimentation or deviance at one point or another. (It wasn't graphically presented to where you look away, though.) That just seemed like an indulgence of the writers, and not something that would be true to their characters. That is why I give the series three and not more stars. I'm glad that I watched it. Now I know more about the mysterious world of undertaking.",1413676800,,1066,4.857142857142857

1793717,3,B00006NT1R,"This is a show I scratch my head over. I honestly have no idea why I continued to watch??? The show's focus is the dysfunctional Fisher family, and their struggling funeral home business in Los Angeles. In the opening episode, the father of the family dies in a car accident, as the rest of the family is gathering together for Thanksgiving Dinner. The younger brother played by Michael C. Hall (Dexter) is a licensed undertaker and ready to take over the family business. His older brother, Nate is kind of drifter, his last full time job was as produce manager at a grocery store, and finds that he's suddenly part owner of the family business. Also thrown into the mix is Claire, the loner, kind of odd daughter still in high school, and this group is led by their bizarre mother, Ruth.

Each episode features a death, some of the cadavers being cared for the Fishers' play a bigger role in the weekly story than others, but all provide background action to the central story, which is basically just this family and their relationships with each other.

Why I don't think I'll pick up with Season 2, is that I simply don't like these characters. Nate is dull, his girlfriend, Brenda, may be one of the most annoying and unlikeable characters ever featured on a TV show, only to be topped by her toxic brother Billy. Quite of few of the episodes featured these three, and with the events of the final episode, I honestly don't care about going forward. The only characters I liked in the whole series were the deceased father (who continues to return in ghost/hallucination form), and Claire.

I know there is an audience out there for this show, because my wife really enjoys it. So maybe if you like ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Parenthood"" or ""Brothers and Sisters"" like she does, this may be a show for you?",1412812800,,1804,4.613707165109035

1793722,5,B00006NT1R,"I was very pleased with this show when it first aired on HBO over a decade ago (eek!)  I liked it enough to get the first couple seasons as they came out on DVD but then lost them in a move.  Very happy to be able to watch Six Feet again via amazon.  No extra charge for Prime Members.  The series centers on a family owned and operated funeral home.  While there is a lot of dark and intellectual humor happening here, there are laughing moments and a wide variety of difficulties both of the Fisher family but their client families as well.  A very interesting and well-done show.  Even though I have watched all episodes in the first season at least two or three times, I could easily watch them again!  I've discussed the same impact it's had on other fans of the show and over the years have turned a few people on to the series and they liked it as well.

1793723,5,B00006NT1R,"This is the Best drama I have ever seen. It's not an action packed, over dramatic soap-opera, or some sex crazed series. It is about issues that you have experienced or been trough. This show has such an easy to follow story-line with complex characters that have the ability to make you feel emotions you have put away.

1793735,4,B00006NT1R,"I am enjoying viewing each episode.
Life and death are two. sides of a coin and each one of us has to go through it.
All we know about death is it can strike any one unexpectedly anywhere when it is least expected and creating complex situations for all around.
The way each episode begins with a death of someone opens our eyes to how many different way it can strike. Very appropriate for the TV serial titled ""SIX FOOT UNDER.""
We know very little about funeral businesses and it educates us about problems and day to day situations and to deal with people from different backgrounds,how they cope with death and their emotions. Very interesting.
And all the characters in the serial have different interests,go through their daily life and is an eye opener to learn about the American family and American ways.
In conclusion, all I would like to tell is how we complicate our life's by creating a web of small fibs and get enmeshed into it .",1412294400,,944,4.526315789473684

That means that streaming is perfect.  I had wondered for years how you made a family living in a funeral home either entertaining or funny.  Now I know.  You take a family that is just a little off kilter and then treat them with respect.  I like them all.  How clever was it to make the most up tight person you are likely to ever see the gay son.  Each character has their own special point of interest, even the father who gets killed in the first three minutes of the show.  By the way, every episode starts with someone becoming a client of the funeral home.  I told you it was fun.",1412121600,,728,4.070422535211268

The acting is spot on  at least for the regular characters. The show has more than its share of dark humor. Still, the problems faced by the main characters are those most if us can relate yo. The writers have blended the mundane with the macabre in a manner that sucks me into the plot and the dilemmas the characters face and keeps me turning on another episode with regularity.",1411603200,,640,4.104

The concerns, struggles, and joys seem genuine. Sometimes profound, timeless aches, other times the characters wallow in American middle class malaise. All well done. You will be so happy for the Fishers, Diazs, and Chenowiths - and they will break your heart.

Literate. Touching. One of the best, most memorable series finales you will ever witness.

It is certainly still relevant today even though it was released in 2001.
Many other reviewers have shared the story line and characters .
I am happy I am able to see it in its entirety and not waiting for the next episode. Some episodes are very dark especially the ones with Brenda and her brother.
Fortunately other characters and subplots are introduced as it is presented in vignettes. There is a lot of dysfunction and acting out so be prepared .

The pilot slowly grabs you and then very soon you cannot wait to see the following episodes. The character development is brilliant! I can't decide if my favorite character is Ruth or Clare. Then again, Nate and David are quite compelling. I have mixed feelings about Brenda, and so it goes. Dialogue is crisp and very real. Although the story centers around a family owned funeral home, the story is so much more. Relationship issues are cleverly explored. And I could go on and on.
Bottom line is one of surprise. I watch very little TV and am selective about what I do watch. Thank  you, amazon prime for providing this on instant streaming.",1406419200,,750,4.58955223880597

Also, it is fanciful at times: This primogenitor funeral home owner, Dad, deceased a year, makes appearances to his widow and children.  He is still with them, guiding, advising, correcting.
I am probably the last American to watch this old series, but I congratulate the writers for putting these two brothers, their sister, their mother and her boyfriends into the black pot and giving them a big stir. What a wise and wacky group.",1405814400,,638,5.018867924528302

1794436,5,B00006NT1R,"I love this series. The characters at first appear typecast, but they soon become dimensional, and they grow. Trigger warnings:
(1) Be prepared to face death: every episode begins with one -- and the one in the opening episode drives the whole story. You'll get an initial look at the body, too -- nothing more than you'd see on the British crime shows, and here they're shown on the embalming room slab as well as in the casket. Occasionally, too, there's violence, but it's never gratuitous.
(2) Also be prepared to learn some things about the funeral business, and I don't mean just the difference between a casket and a coffin. There's plenty of show and tell (mostly tell) about ""restoration,"" the process of showing even the most damaged corpse at its best, thanks to the magic of the undertaker's special variety of cosmetic materials. And there's plenty of interaction with grieving families of every -- yes, every -- stripe.
(3) There's quite a lot of sex, too, both straight and gay, and sometimes gratuitous, imho.
(4) Language.
All that said: Six Feet Under is comedic, thanks to approaches both broad and highly nuanced; and occasionally tragic, thanks to, well, the vagaries of life, because this is what the series depicts. All the characters are likable, though not all the time, or at the same time. All of them struggle, to be true to themselves, to be good people, to honor the deceased. In this respect, I'd place this series on the same level of quality as The Sopranos.",1405814400,,1491,4.760617760617761

1794439,4,B00006NT1R,"A unique blend of the business of death and a very dysfunctional (to put it mildly) family and friends.  The creativity that goes into the ""preparation for viewing"" of the deceased is educational and the economics fascinating.  In one scene, the funeral director asked the grieving widow what type of car her husband drove.  After she replied, ""the largest BMW model"", he turned to the priciest casket section for the sale.  And it worked, of course.",1405814400,,450,4.881578947368421

1794466,3,B00006NT1R,"It has some interestingly quirky characters, but the only things holding this show back is the insistence on the over use of swear words (F this, F that) and gore just because it was on a pay network that has no such restrictions.

A better example of the adage ""a little goes a long way"" was Breaking Bad on AMC.  Since basic cable still has a few rules, they had to be judicious in their use of violent imagery and adult language, so when the filmmakers did get to use them... those scenes really packed a punch!

Far too many filmmakers these days subscribe to the notion that an abundance of R-rated language equals an ""adult"" script and that audiences want to see every gross thing imaginable rather than leaving some things up to the imagination.  In fact, it's what you don't see that can make things more disturbing when a scene calls for it.",1405555200,,850,4.464516129032258

I'm displeased with Amazon Prime movies because: Everytime I watch ashow or a movie I have to logout and log back in to see the next movie or show.

The show centers around a family that owns a funeral business and the people in their lives.

It did start a little slow for my taste, but something caught my attention so came back for another go and before I knew it I was hooked on the characters, the wide range of great guest stars, and the many twists and turns of plot.

The writing is so creative and very high quality unlike so many TV show now. I think I could watch these over and over and never get tired of them versus watching a new series one time and that would be enough. I love watching them on my Kindle HDX or on my big screen.,1405382400,,388,3.8625

I could do without the explicit gay and sex scenes. They really don't add anything to the story. Its just Hollywood trying to shock us. If you like character development you will probably like this show. The show tries to make tragedy into comedy and occasionally succeeds. Class up the sexuality and it would be a 5 star show.,1404777600,,458,4.666666666666667

Also the language was excessive. There are other ways to express strong feelings. Having said that the story line of a family trying to come to grips with their own problems while also trying to serve others in a time of need is told with sensitivity. As for this families issues they pretty well cover everything in the book from a father dying suddenly, a gay son struggling with how to tell the world, a girl friend with a psychotic brother, and a younger sister experimenting with drugs and sex.

Now I think it may be truly brilliant.  While each episode will stand on its own and can be enjoyed on one level, seeing the development of the relationships between all the major characters (and there are quite a few of them) makes this far more interesting and layered.  The highly charged relationship between Brenda and Nate becomes far more understandable when, in these first few episodes, you meet her completely screwed up family.

Six Feet Under is one of those shows you can probably binge watch.  I am now thinking I will slowly go through the entire series if it becomes available.  This may be one of the best ever made for US cable television.",1404172800,,915,4.617283950617284

The characters in the storyline manage to live their lives like the rest of us, despite dealing with death on a daily basis.

 The family, comprised of a recently deceased funeral director, his wife, two adult sons and his highschool aged daughter,  The family live in an old, beautiful home, one like you might see on the main strreet of any major city where elegant living in past times bespoke of an  upper class.  Living in the their dark, unnatural environment of death, their humanity shines through.

Behind the polished, cool, demure of a mortician's presentation there is another life; the sadness, the tragedy, the challenges, and sometimes the humor of dealing with alive and dead people shows how far off life is from perfect, how life can be so fragile, and how we handle death within the stages of our life, and within our own understanding of death.

One of few shows that dares to explore religious faith and family relationships in a thoughtful way without resorting to predictable stereotypes. The first TV series to openly and straightforwardly portray gay male relationships. Tackles the big life issues head-on: life, death, loss, alienation, grief, our deepest fears, the nature of families and the search for meaning in a chaotic world. it's also really, really funny. The producers wisely chose offbeat, imperfect-looking actors and imbued their characters with humor and complexity. Each show opens with a death. But don't be put off. It's all designed as a jumping-off place for an examination of the choices we make and the lives we create out of the whole-cloth of our pain, messed-up childhoods and limited perceptions of reality.

I've watched the first and second seasons so far and I'm currently watching the third.  Since it's included with Prime membership, I can watch it at my leisure.

This show gives you a sneak peek into the world of funeral homes with great story lines and is ALWAYS unexpected, especially the first episode. I also like the ""commercials"" that are sprinkled throughout the show.
I watched Six Feet Under when it originally aired and loved it then. Years later, it's almost brand new and is worth a second look to gain a new prospective on what you thought you knew.

1794707,2,B00006NT1R,"I saw half of the first season and I didn't see any reviews that reflected my view of the series.  The only negative reviews were those who had a problem with gay Dexter and his black and muscular cop boyfriend.  Maybe the MPAA should have gradations of gayness for these people:  It'd range from Andy Dick to Portia de Rossi.

The series is about a family run funeral home whose father died and the business is left to the two estranged brothers.  I get the point of the series, I think.  Funerals have a choreographed feel to them, like a play.  People pay tens of thousands of dollars to dress up the primal horror of death into a gaudy spectacle (one brother's perspective).  Or, from the other brother's perspective, it could be thought of as bringing some order, meaning, and dignity to death.  (It's smart to have a closeted gay guy who believes in wearing a mask in public, so I don't get the criticism there).  The series examines the impact of growing up with the business of making death into a pageant and the need to make life more real.  I think.

My problem with the series is that all the characters are selfish and self indulgent people who constantly rebel against society's rules.  Whether it's blowing twenty five grand at a horse race and saying ""I deserve to feel"" or if it's jeopardizing a twelve million dollar lawsuit by putting a body part in a locker as revenge, these people are more preoccupied with their personal bullsh-- than the consequences of their actions.  I hate it when emotional people feel like they have a right to be destructive or make a giant scene.  To me, it's low classed and tasteless to show a woman with mascara running down her cheeks hitting a car with a baseball bat, and that's exactly how I perceive every woman in this series-- especially the mother!  I also fully expect gay Dexter to have a full breakdown in public.  These are the people on Jerry Springer or TruTV:  When funeral directors go wild.

This series about people acting out won a bunch of awards, and I'm not sure why.  One odd phrase I hear on Oprah and female empowerment stuff is ""You go girl!""  To me, that would almost always seem like bad advice.  ""Take a deep breath, close your eyes, and think about your next move"" would almost always seem like much better advice to an emotionally distraught woman.

I'd be horrified to make a spectacle about myself and this family and those around them (except the gay cop) seem to be utterly devoid of shame.  I think a few days of back breaking work in a field is just what this family needs.  Or is that not the ""realness of life"" that they were going for?",1403481600,8,2626,4.477894736842106

Six Feet Under, in my opinion, is the crown jewel of their studio work and one of the best series to ever grace the small screen. It's a dark and irreverent satire that meshes erratic human emotionalism with an unforgiving focus on life and death the we are often afraid to make. It's hard to stop watching once you start.

Love the humor, drama, quirks, and the cast. I find myself busting to see what's happening with the Fishers! Really can't believe it took us this long to discover this great show.",1403049600,,356,4.25
1794750,5,B00006NT1R,Trolling for something mindless after tough work day.  Dark sounded good.  I found myself really enjoying the program and that the characters reacted in a real way.  Wanting to scream at inane people during a funeral...yes!  But you smile...and then reality leaks in and takes over.  I love real.  It felt real.  Recommend,1403049600,,322,4.962264150943396

1794752,5,B00006NT1R,This show covered alot of events dealing with life and death.  It was also enlightening on how families deal with grief,1403049600,,119,4.666666666666667

1794754,4,B00006NT1R,"This was better than I expected. Even my husband, who typically doesn't 'get into' a show, was glued to the screen for episode after episode. Being an HBO series, it can be pretty graphic in case that's not for you.",1403049600,,215,4.4

1794756,3,B00006NT1R,The idea of the show is genious. Love the way every episode opens with the different ways people die. Like all the actors/actresses . The downer for me was the gay scenes that ruined it to want to add to the collection . Yea Old fashioned  that way.,1403049600,,249,4.1875

1794758,5,B00006NT1R,"Six Feet Under, season 1, which I originally watched when it first aired on HBO back in 2001, is an incredible mix of happy times suddenly hit by tragedy to close to home. The first season sets the stage for the following seasons in developing the characters, each one with daily challenges, personal issues, and all with ""secrets"" that they continue to hide, fearing the worst if they were to be known, at least in season 1. Watching this season a second time on Amazon 13 years later has shown myself how much I have grown and changed since I first watched it in 2001. My perceptions of the intricate and protected relationships is even more intriguing and spellbinding with each crises that rises up. Highly recommended for those who seek answers through watching others go through similar situations, and totally realistic.",1402963200,,827,4.830985915492958
1794759,5,B00006NT1R,Interesting and offbeat. Like Michael Hall. Every episode has a new story and there is no violence and over emotional dramatic scenes other series add because they don't already have variety.,1402963200,,191,5.193548387096774

1794762,5,B00006NT1R,I worked two jobs for years so I missed many series on TV.  This is one that I really wanted to see but did not have a chance.  I am definitely going to watch more seasons of this fun quirky show.  I love the characters and the emotions expressed by all of the morners.,1402963200,,269,3.9444444444444446
1794763,5,B00006NT1R,"SFU is such an odd show about a family who runs a funeral home in California. Though the subject matter is often dark, the main characters' flawed and vulnerable personalities bring life into this morbid setting. There is a good bit of humor in the mix which brings levity to the show. There is a lot of talk about sex on the show, as well as brief nudity and sex scenes. Therefore this is not a family show, but an adult drama. The actors are excellent and you can really get drawn into the stories. I watched the first season in just a few days. I'm sorry I did not see it in 2001 when it first came out, but I did not subscribe to HBO. I look forward to seasons 2 through 5. I highly recommend this series. You will not be disappointed .",1402963200,,740,4.110344827586207

1794766,5,B00006NT1R,"Well done introduction of the main characters and a well developed plot make the program a pleasure to watch. Each character with their own strengths, weaknesses and flaws is engaging in their own way. The plot premise, while unusual enhances the idea that there really is no standard family unit with which to compare our own and that no matter what the situation our families are in, they all have their own brand of bizarre to deal with. I like it.",1402876800,,451,4.580246913580247

Worth watching and see how you feel about the show.",1402790400,,232,4.177777777777778
1794769,5,B00006NT1R,Conservatives beware. There are way too many references to W Bush in this series but what do you expect when it's based in LA. However this is the best non-violent drama series HBO or any of the other pay movie channels ever put out. The character development is amazing even in the second and third teir characters.  Love the series but wish the writers had kept their political views out of the scripts.,1402790400,,405,4.5479452054794525
1794770,4,B00006NT1R,"Excellent premise for a TV show.

After watching Episode 1, I remember seeing it years ago. May have been on DVD; however, I never watched anything after it until Amazon added the show to Amazon Prime.

I thought the show was excellent in spite of the weird relationship between Billy and Brenda. Without spoiling anything, I could not grasp what was/is going on. This may (hopefully) be cleared up in seasons yet to watch. As a watcher of Dexter, it took only a few episodes to erase the serial killer of serial killers image from my mind when watching the David character.

I'll be binge watching Season 2 over the next week!

Still, it is one of the most original series I've ever experienced on television.  Frances Conroy is great.  The banter between Brenda and Nate is enticing.  Towards the end of the run, it begins to lose steam, though the episodes with Kathy Bates are pretty good.  This seems to happen to all series that go on for more than two or three series--some of the favorite characters are written out, just when we were beginning to warm to them.

Today in 2014 we're deluged with gay everything so it's not much of a shocker anymore. However, HBO really exploits the gay character in this series, providing scene after scene of graphic gay sex, gay sex talk, etcetera. Frankly I found that it really detracted from the storyline, but then again this is 2001 and HBO has to have something that makes the public want to pay extra for their content and apparently graphic gay content was it (follow the money). In Season 2 the gay character is given as much airtime but the storyline is a bit more muted.. I'm only half way through Season 2 at this point. Very enjoyable series, Rachel Griffith's character though is really annoying, like anyone in their right mind would choose to stay with that woman, every time she has a scene with Peter Krauss' character (Nate Fisher) I keep telling Nate ""Run away, run away!"" I did find it enlightening to find out that according to the series the markup on their pricier caskets is $6K, wow, what gougers!",1401753600,,1222,4.584474885844749

I first watched the whole series by checking out each season box set from  my local library. I became addicted, I had to know what was going to happen. The characters are very well developed and each have their own unique story and drama. The acting is amazing as well including Michael C Hall, also known as Dexter, as one of the main supporting actors.

My biggest complaint about the show is the last season seems strange and not to go quite with the flow of the other seasons and then about half way through the last season it is like the writers said "" Well screw this we are out of a job lets just write anything, but lets make sure we never have to work with these jerks again"" The ending speeds through in a strange way.",1401753600,,896,4.203488372093023

1794898,4,B00006NT1R,"You'll find yourself being sold on the outrageously overpriced ""death services"" offered by Fisher and Sons Funeral Home with a family drama acted out by one irresponsible sexually compulsive son,  one responsible (and bitter) gay son,  an authentic and wonderfully individualistic teenage daughter, and an emotionally repressed mother.  Lauren Ambrose especially shines as Claire,  the odd kid in school whose artistic talent, spiritual depth, drug use and adolescent angst collide to create a character of incredible depth. Michael C. Hall, a Shakespearean train actor, flawlessly creates the character of David, the gay son who gave up everything for the family business, with palpable bitterness and repression. Peter Krause's portrayal of his prodigal brother Nate fairly sizzles with sexual promiscuity and with emotional ambivalence for the industry's profit-centeredness balanced against a true opportunity to serve families at a time of their greatest emotional need.  One can almost see the boiling repressed inner life of Ruth Fisher as she agonizes over family dinner while casually having an affair with a hair dresser which she ends the moment it no longer constitutes adultery. Frances Conroy creates the character of Ruth with indelible depth as she plays a woman who is so grieved at the loss of her husband that she throws a pot roast across the room, while at the same time wanting to be sure his body can be ""viewed"" in the casket as evidence that Fisher and Sons takes pride in their work. There isn't an emotion she doesn't dodge or a fact about her children she doesn't vehemently deny.

This was my favorite; I have to be home (DVR was not an option in 2001); cannot miss it show when it originally aired. So, I'm thrilled to be watching it again 13 years later. The bonus is I can watch it at my leisure, and my twins are adults now, so they can enjoy with me!!

1794936,3,B00006NT1R,"This show is EXTREMELY SLOW and it makes you sit there, with VERY LITTLE plot progression, while the family members howl over deaths and deal with their personal baggages. While its sad and you feel for the characters, it got so frustrating for me that I stopped caring about every one of them and found myself wanting the scenes to move on because I was getting tired of seeing them wallow in depression and family drama over and over again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE character depth and philosophical plotlines, but this show just doesn't progress from a single scene. Its just really weird to explain you have to watch a single episode to see what I mean.
I know some people may enjoy this, but this is DEFINITELY not my cup of tea. I would have rated this 1 star, but I tried to be objective because I know many people love this show and probably for a good reason too. But this show is just not for me.",1400889600,,908,4.315789473684211

Think my favorite scene out of the whole series was when Nate found out he had a brain tumor and a motorcycle gang had hired the funeral home to hold a memorial for a fallen member.  Turned out in the end they gave the deceased's Harley to Nate as payment and the last scene of that particular episode was him riding down the highway through the desert, moving like the wind with Blue Oyster Cult's ""Fear The Reaper"" playing in the background.

(Also a great show). My husband had never seen the show so now we are watching together and he loves it too, just like I knew he would. :)",1396742400,,315,4.080645161290323
1794945,5,B00006NT1R,"I'm constantly in search of brilliant writing, skilled directing, and consummate acting. After I watched ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad"" several times over, after I'd gone through ""Firefly"" and ""Slings and Arrows"" (and after I'd tried and rejected ""'Supernatural,"" ""The Closer,"" ""Saving Grace,"" ""Orange is the New Black,"" and some show about birthin' babies), I thought I would never again find a show that would make me look forward to sitting down and watching each and every episode. That would make me feel hooked.

""Six Feet Under"" is that show.  It's perfect.  The writing is indeed brilliant, and the characters are interesting, well-rounded, and fun to know. Likable or not (and some are decidedly not), each and every character -- from the 60-something Mom to the funeral home's young ""restorative artist"" -- has a rich inner life and story of his/her own. And there's a delightful twist to SFU: you know how many television shows are designed so that the main characters come in contact with new people/situations each week?  The ""Star Trek"" crew flew to different planets, ""The Love Boat"" had different ports of call, cop shows have a crime/villain of the week, and so on. Well, every SFU begins with a death, and into each episode is woven the story of the deceased, and we typically get to meet the family members -- whether they're gang-bangers, Japanese monks, or stars in the porn industry.

About which: SFU features the ""F"" word about a jillion times, and also nudity, and sex, sex, sex.  (Sometimes I refer to it as ""Sex Feet Under."") If you're squeamish about these things, it would be a shame because you'll miss a gem of a show. Quirky, offbeat, funny, heart-wrenching, unflinching, original and, as previously mentioned, brilliant. If you have a deep appreciation for the absurd done to perfection, you'll love this show as much as I do.",1396656000,,1857,4.898089171974522

1794948,5,B00006NT1R,"Not only is this a show about a family owned funeral home, but other concepts and situations also take place within everyone's personal lives outside of the business as well. Performances from all the cast are superb and just so outstanding it leaves you wanting to know more about what will happen with them individually. You will start to really like them and also see that by them owning and working in a funeral home, the dead are more alive than they are at times. Illieana Douglas guest stars on a couple of episodes said it best: ""I've never worked in a funeral home that was this depressing.""  To me there are quite a lot of funny moments throughout the show as well and you will see that this show does put the ""fun"" in funeral at times. Also there is a lot of sad moments, especially when at the beginning of every episode someone dies and it's expected that the Fisher family has to tend to the funeral, but also some of the deathly situations are a little on the crazy and funny side of things too, which makes a person wonder, ""Is there really a chance in something like that happening?"" But it's when the Fishers have to take in the deceased and prep them for their services that sometimes it gets strange when their imaginations run away with them and they believe they are actually having conversations with the deceased. That's what makes these characters such unique people and it's what gives the show a it's name ""Six Feet Under"", cause it's just not the amount of feet where a body is laid to rest, it's also giving a perspective on how ""deep"" the characters can be.

It's one of the only tv shows I have on DVD because I actually DO watch it over and over again.  This serie seems to mirror real life better than most, you feel like you're watching actual events unfold.  The only reason I started watching this show is because of the dark undertones.  We follow a family who recently lost their father and is at a loss for what to do.  They now need to run the family business all one their own, which happens to be funeral directing and embalming.  Each character has their own storyline and each is as interesting as it gets.  The acting is superb.  I love Frances Conroy and I'll watch anything she's in.  The first season is really intense and incredibly addicting.  I bought season after season off amazon.  Once I finished the last episode of one season, I signed into my account, purchased the next, and waited until it showed up on my doorstep.

Like most HBO shows, it's cutting edge.  It pulls no punches.

The ensemble cast is awash in talent.  The writing is very original, and yet still captures the lives of modern American.  The characters are well drawn and, while quirky, straight out of real life.

This show never has and never will garner the fame of other all-time great shows like The Sopranos.  There's only one reason:  The Sopranos is about gangsters.  Six Feet Under is about funeral directors.  So conceptually, it's not as sexy.  But on an artistic level, Six Feet Under has no equal.",1367020800,,658,4.586206896551724

1795015,5,B00006NT1R,"Initially conceived and directed by Alan Ball, this series is unlike anything that's ever been on television or cable. The backdrop of a family run funeral home is unique enough, but we're also given a cast of characters that are anything but stereotypical. Each episode follows a loose format where initially a person dies and then the end up at the Fisher & Sons funeral home. Their own back-story may (or may not) intertwine with the episode as it plays out. In ensuing episodes of the series, the main characters become more fully developed, and a number of story lines are pursued.

I pulled them out of the DVD player and under closer examination, these discs looked like they were skipped down a cement driveway!  Stratches and fingerprints everywhere!

The cast is sensational from Fances Conroy, Lauren Amborse to the excellent Richard Jenkins, it's smart, beautifully written and totally engaging. The fact that the family biz is a funeral home is really secondary although fascinting in it's own right.

The show is about family, about profound loss and moving on. Humor, sadness and the full range of human emotion and the struggle of relationships Six Feet Under has earned it's place at the table of all time classics. We own the boxed set of DVD's with great packaging - grass on top and a small flat tomb stone. It was worth every penny.

According to Amazon's DVD specs, Seasons 1 and 2 were presented at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, while the other seasons went to 1.78:1. I suspect the aspect ratio (and corresponding video quality) are preventing its release on Blu-ray.

1795039,5,B00006NT1R,The writing and acting are outstanding.  It's amazing to see Michael C Hall playing a repressed gay mortician after watching him gleefully offing bad guys on Dexter.  Frances Conroy as the mother is a special treat and Lauren Ambrose as the younger sister is unforgettable.  Rachel Griffin acts with her usual dynamic heartfelt excellence.  Freddy Rodriguez holds his own as the embalmer with a gift for making the corpse look lifelike.  The Nate character is a bit annoying but not enough to let you take your eyes off the other dazzlers.  The secondary characters are also superb.  There's a funeral every week and its always a great backdrop for whatever the characters are experiencing.,1349481600,,690,5.0

Enjoy watching the characters develop; the stories do a nice job getting these people out of their respective self-imposed shells.  Knowing the opening scene in each show will feature someone's untimely death is a nice device for this series (if not a completely original concept).  Show's not perfect, not for everyone (especially the occasional gay lifestyle portrayals, which will make some folks uncomfortable), but is VERY good, consistent and engrossing.

This is one of those series where you are hooked from the beginning.  I found myself running through the gamut of emotions for every episode.  This includes many laugh out loud moments.  For a series that deals primarily with death, there are many moments that deal with life like no series I've watched before.  Now onto season 2!",1346025600,,619,4.513513513513513

But as i kept watching, there was always something memorable about an episode from Richard Jenkins making appearences as the brothers dead father or the goody two shoes brother played by Michael C. Hall (Dexter)and other interesting characters The acting is excellent and the main theme title intriguing. Im not gunna say anymore, there is no middle ground with a show like this, its either you love it or hate it. If you saw ""American Beauty""(one of my favorite movies) you might appreciate this show a bit more. If the show keeps up with the good story, count me in for season 2. In other words the season was in the mail when i got home wrapped in plastic and in 100 percent perfect condition.

In fact if you don't have time to go through all five complete seasons, I highly recommend the first season complete and the last episode of the fifth and last season.

Some of the stories in between in seasons 2-4 are a little far fetched but always we see at the beginning of all seasons who died at the beginning and how.

I do have all five seasons complete and am glad I have them but only bought them because they were such low prices I couldn't pass them up. By the way we have all the Sopranos as well and have a yearly watching of that series and this one.",1330905600,,705,4.0647482014388485

The problem:  I didn't get HBO back when ""Six Feet Under"" started and by the time I knew it was a good program I was years behind, and I watch a lot of TV, so never got around to it.  But now, as I get older, I am getting pickier.  I really only want to watch very good television.  Consequently for the last couple of months I've had nothing much to watch except ""Breaking Bad"" and now ""The Closer.""  So last night I suggested to my husband that we find this program and rent it online -- we couldn't stream it from Netflix and rented it from Amazon instead.  I was disappointed that I couldn't rent the whole season for a discounted rate, so back to Netflix to have the individual DVDs mailed to me.  But the series premiere did not disappoint.  It is now ten years old, and I could see where many of my favorite actors got a start and some of my favorite TV programs may have picked up a technique or two.  This must have been truly unique and ground breaking in 2001, but it doesn't disappoint today.  Great actors, great lines, lots of quirky and odd developments to follow.

Most of them were about the price of the set or the vendor they bought from- not the show itself. Those who didn't like the show are mostly the puritanical homophobic set. Yes, this is not the series to watch if you can't handle two men kissing. However, if you're past all that and want to watch something unique, genuine and gorgeously shot, this is the series for you. Someone lamented he couldn't watch with his kids. Uh, hello...this is not a family show.

Are the characters whiny and boring sometimes? Yes, they are....and they freely admit it. That's part of what makes the show unique. It shows us how we live as Americans with depth and purity rarely seen elsewhere.",1309737600,,803,4.5

""Dexter"" starred in this series in 2001 which was another reason I decided to give Six Feet a try.  The dynamics of the entire family kinda reminds me of some of the ""unspoken"" things that went around my house as a kid growing up.  We didn't talk about how we felt.  In one particular episode where Freddy's replacement stated ""I've never been at a funeral home where it was so depressing"".  At that point, I realized this was more than a series about a family business, it was more about ""family"".  It's obvious they all care for each other, but they can't seem to muster up the courage to really, really allow themselves to allow their family members ""in"".  There are these walls that take time to break down and I am very interested in how this will all come together.

The series shows the diverse family relationships of the Fisher and Sons Funeral Home.  This is a Funeral Home that is situated in Los Angeles and has a family history of pride and top quality embalming and well organized funerals.  Every detail is important.

The script is original and the cast is outstanding.  The credits show Michael C. Hall, Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, Rachel Griffiths, Fredding Rodriquez, and Patricia Clarkson and they are all polished in their acting skills.  The everyday lives and secret personal lives are exposed as each interesting and unique story around each funeral unfolds.

The guilt, sadness,  anger along with a sense of propriety permeate outrageous stories of inconvenient death.  Overall, the tongue in cheek spirit of the funeral business is a darkly funny topic .",1280620800,,901,5.116438356164384

For all its worth, the series will change your perspective in life. Alan ball (the creator and co- directer/producer) does a fantastic job putting this master piece with the 6 brilliant wiritters. I've watched, Entourage, The Sorpronos, The Wire, Dexter, Brotherhood, Carnivale, Mad Men, Californiacation and Nip/Tuck (just to name a few) and I've honestly never been so connected emotionally after the entire series than after Six Feet Under. I'll be the first to say that the first season is the least addicting of the 5 seasons but is still a great pendulum to get the ball moving. When you have the best acting, the best writting, great inspiration, and a brilliant setting, I guess everything just takes its place. Not to spoil anything... the dad of the family get killed in the first episode and the family (being funeral directors) has to cope with his death. Nathanal (the dad) is there throughout the series and inspires David (whos is gay), Nate who is his son, Ruth who is his wife, and Clare who is his misfitting daughter.
  I promise that this series will not let you down and you will connect with the characters to a point that doesnt happen in most shows. The lessons are witty and progressive and towards the end of each episode you'll be craving more ;)  -Brandon",1276300800,2,1417,4.682730923694779
1795117,4,B00006NT1R,"This is basically a soap opera set in a funeral home.  That's different in itself.  The owner is killed in the first episode, although he continues to make ghostly appearances in numerous episodes, giving advice, acting as the Greek chorus.

The business is taken over by two relatively young sons, one of whom is gay (his partner is a black man with the LAPD) and one of whom has several heterosexual encounters.  Their sister is in high school, later in art school, and she also sleeps around, as well as the widowed mother.

There are several other lesser figures, such as Rico, the young Latino embalmer, a Russian florist, various girlfriends, and at least one dead person in every episode.  Each episode follows the love affairs of the sons, the daughter, and the mother--each with a lifestyle that I think of as CALIFORNIA, where there are ""relationships,"" rather than--well, you can guess what.  All the figures are uninhibited in their language.

1795122,5,B00006NT1R,"It is refreshing to come across intelligent drama even if you have to go to an undertaker's house to find it.  Six Feet Under offers a morbidly fine set of stories, filled with surprises and carried by an excellent cast.  It is one of those rare shows where the actors inhabit their roles and make you feel part of the action.  The first episode sets the stage marvelously with Richard Jenkins meeting his sudden fate and bequeathing his mortuary business to his sons, who couldn't be any further apart.  Not to worry, Papa pays visits on his family to see how things are going, as Nate and David struggle to keep the business going against a powerful rival while Mama and Claire tries to re-establish themselves.  The quirkiness of the pilot episode isn't quite matched in succeeding episodes.  The undertakers' product ads were so funny and it is a shame that they didn't follow through with more of them.

Probably the most surprising element of this series is how frank Alan Ball is about David's homosexuality and his various relationships. Ball also explores a very dynamic relationship between Nate and Brenda and Brenda's brother, Billy.  Claire's teenage angst is also dealt with sensitively, even if one struggles to find what she sees in Gabriel.  And, Ruth makes for a very engaging mother as she tries to figure out what is going on under her roof while pursuing new relationships of her own.  I can't remember when I last so such a complex set of emotions play out on television.

One of the things I like about HBO series is their compactness.  At 13 episodes, you can take in the first season over the course of a couple weeks and enjoy the various stories play out.  Each episode wraps nicely around itself like a well turned short story.  Six Feet Under is quite simply one of the best dramas to come to television.",1250380800,,1833,4.6521739130434785

1795124,3,B00006NT1R,"Mildly disappointed at the same ol' same ol' treatment of anyone with conservative views as mean, stupid, or hard hearted, I did like the examination of the funeral industry, mores about death and dying, and the lives of funeral directors. The very course language, free-wheeling sexual escapades, extreme drug use serve to remind everyone that this funeral home is a product of its California culture..... where all things that smack of 'alternative' are good and all things traditional are bad. The main characters---Nate and Brenda are the sanest of them all thanks to Brenda's counter-culture hippy therapist parents (and her degrees in social work). The mother and father of the family are caught in some kind of time warp.....the father looks like a throw back to the rat pack and the mother from June Cleaver's 50's. I realized with a start that these two--the matriarch and patriarch of the family are MY AGE when they briefly mentioned the father's three year tour as a medic in Vietnam and his collection of 60's psychedelic music on vinyl mixed with big band sounds. I don't know one Vietnam Veteran who wears a Fedora Hat.
The part of David, the gay brother who runs the funeral home, is juciest of all--- conflicted, self-loathing, religious yet doubtful, and yet all-too-adventurous leads the viewer to inevitably worry about David's sanity and safety. Yet, by the end of the season, the viewer must see that the one who seems so healthy and sure might be the next one to end up dead in a box without really knowing the fulfillment of life. Mildly preachy, we see alternative life styles and personalities with free and easy mores and values as somehow superior to deeply held beliefs. Even Ruth, the mom, becomes a wildcat.
My favorite character is Federicko---as he sees life as a whole and enjoys his work. Very refreshing these days. He carries this show and is the only person on it with whom I can relate.

1795145,5,B00006NT1R,"Is what you are seeing in this show dysfunctional or is it normal? These are the sort of questions that this wonderful series raises with every scene. So true to life and yet so surreal, Six Feet Under is easily one of the best TV dramas of all time. Take the film American Beauty and mix it with a funeral home and you end up with a story that is moving, genuine, unforgettable, multifaceted and picturesque. After one or two episodes you will be hooked and addicted until the very end with characters so vibrant and real that they literally jump out of the screen at you. Moving in many ways there are sparkles of joy within every episode as well as many pains, just bask in this performance and let it flow over you.

Nathaniel Fisher is dead but haunts his family's dreams including his control freak wife Ruth, and their children David, a raging homosexual and neurotic Claire who all operate a small funeral home. Nate the weekend hippy returns to help them with their business and makes a new girlfriend, Brenda the daughter of not just one but two psychiatrists who has many secrets.

Episode themes include reunions, inheritance, severed feet, gangs, decons, old age, the army, dating, accidental gun death, mental health, babies and homophobia.

Six Feet Under is a real mental magnet that hooks you from the opening sequences to the closing credits. You will be hard pressed to find a better drama out there. The whole thing just knocks you for 10 with its many twists and original take on life. If you haven't experienced Six Feet Under then nothing should be stopping you.

Nate, the black sheep of the family who left years before to get out of working in the family business (a funeral home in L.A.).
David, the homosexual brother who is uptight and a workaholic funeral director.
Claire, their sister who is like Morticia from the Adamms Family.
Moma...at first you think she is the typical mom but then you find out how she somehow attracts the men even though she is portrayed as dowdy.
Dad...killed in first episode while driving his new hearse home but continues to hang around to torment the family in off moments for a number of episodes.
Brenda, the weird girlfriend of Nate who he met on plane coming home.
The show doesn't make you laugh out loud but it does make you chuckle a lot. The characters are all likeable. There's quite a bit of bad language and some sex scenes so it's not a good idea to get for a family movie. Each story has at least one death to bring in business at the funeral home. They are all unusual deaths...like a cat knocked electric hair curler into tub of a porn star, a man gets mixed in a dough mixer...totally bizarre but at least there is some humor to it. The family's trials and tribulations are in each episode and even Claire has a number of spots while dating or going to school. The situations she gets in are very funny. In one episode, business is so bad that they start letting senior square dancers rent out one room in order to bring in money and hopefully get their funeral business later too!

A review is supposed to be about the PRODUCT: in this case, Season 1 of Six Feet Under.  Is it worth watching?  YES  Is it an entertaining show?  YES  Are the storylines and characters engaging and interesting?  YES  Is it worth the hours spent watching it?  YES

Over the last few years I started renting TV shows on DVD and watching the series consequtively, I found that I enjoy it more this way.  I can watch one or two episodes a night- many nights in a row if I want.  It is helpful in getting sort of hooked on a show, and also keeping the momentum of the storylines going, and also my memory of events (vs. watching it over a period of say 5 years).  So, if you're looking at Six Feet Under as a series like this to buy/watch- I highly recommend it.  Buy it, rent it, borrow it from a friend, watch re-runs, whatever you want.  But do NOT miss this show!  I might just bite the bullet and say perhaps this is my favorite TV show of ALL time.

Ok, as for Season 1...it's a bit slow going for me at first.  I think my hubby and I were on disc two and we sort of looked at each other and said, do we want to keep watching this?  The characters just weren't clicking for us.  And the funny dream and daydream sequences were annoying.  But, I said, let's finish the season out and then see what we think.  I am SO glad that we did!  By then, we were hooked.  Each night we looked forward to an episode or two of Six Feet Under.  Sometimes I ran out to the video store at 10pm to get a new one because we just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.

So ya...the stories get better, the characters get a bit more defined and fun, and eventually there are less weird dream sequences.  So if you are looking for a TV show that will keep you up at night watching, this is it!  Stick it out, give it a try and I bet you won't be disappointed.",1215648000,4,2015,4.005037783375315

It was trying to hard to be ""artsy"" with stupid fake commercials of funeral products and weird dream sequences.  It tried to get everything shocking into one episode- death, gore, dead bodies, explicit casual sex in a closet, explicit hard-core drug use in teens, intimacy between gay men, teen bullying and lots of foul language.  I actually have no objection to the above list as single entities to explore as social issues and life and death, but to throw all of them into my face at once was not entertainment.
My teen and pre-teen both popped in during the time I was watching and had to be sent out quickly, as the ""adult"" themes (i.e. those from the list above) popped up so quickly that the kids couldn't stay but a few seconds before another adult scene was showing.
Episodes two and three are better than the pilot, character development is progressing and the cheap gimicks are mostly gone.  I am debating if I will continue on with the series or send it back-- pretty expensive for something I have to seriously hide from the kids.

The comic timing of these actors and the precision of the writing is admirable, but it's worth a mention that the humor is very dry and often dark.  That's how I like my humor, but it might not be someone else's cuppa.

While ""Six Feet Under"" has universal themes of life and death (more of the latter), it isn't a show for everyone.  Some people love it while others simply don't get it.  I absolutely find myself in the former category, but I understand why the humor is lost on some people.  I feel that most people who DO give the show a try will enjoy it, but the pacing and dialogue-heavy scenes may not please the impatient.

With both of those shows, that is not the case, and it's also true here that ""Six Feet Under"" isn't JUST a show about a family running funeral home.  The character arcs and situations in each of these thirteen episodes are enthralling and the overall season is superb, especially for a first.  I'd list the highlights and low-points, but there aren't any weak links in this season.

1795187,5,B00006NT1R,"i watched all 4 of the discs last night. somewhat of a marathon, but i was certainly addicted from the first subtle but funny joke.

What makes this an addictive series to me?
it is unlike anything else i've watched on TV and appreciated.
from Perry Mason, to The Waltons, to Scrubs, to MASH, i have pretty staid tastes.
from Star Trek to Stargate, i have always had a weakness for scifi, but this series is about romance and difficult lives and interactions with people.
all things which i usually find boring and consign to the wife's pile of dvd's.

what can i possibly find interesting to the point of watching 12-13 hours straight?
there is lots of coarse and sexually explicit language.
one of the main characters is gay and spirals out of control in rather an explicit way.

but mostly it is about death and dying. how people cope and how some people don't.
it is a humor hiding a painful point, it is humor as coverup and ragged clothes so the nakedness of people's lives isn't so in your face.
i've done a lot of thinking about death and dying over the last handful of years, perhaps that is why it rings a bell for me, when i won't have predicted it to.

but it is the high quality of the writing and the directing that impresses me most.
there are pieces that i just glanced at, that i pause or rewind for. i suspect i could even watch them a second time, something i very rarely can do.
In a series, where they can develop the characters over many hours, character often takes a front seat to plot.
But like the first Star Treks, each hour has a major point, the point is looked at from several people's ongoing lives, and often explored in a decent way, something TV is not known for.
Completeness or even coherence. both figure high in these shows.

The shows are thoughtful, artistically done, a bit heavy on the language but most of it is not gratuitous.
it is going to turn a lot of people off to see men passionately kissing, big deal, ff if you have to.
i am looking forward to my complete set arriving soon.
i wonder how long i'll sit watching these before i fall asleep?",1187740800,2,2091,4.351282051282051

1795190,5,B00006NT1R,"I have often heard people say that All in the Family could never be produced today. I think this is true, at least, for network television (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX). All in the Family captures a specific moment in both television and American history. Carroll O'Connor excellently renders the American bigot, Archie Bunker, and puts him up for scrutiny before a live audience. All in the Family was not entirely about political correctness and bigotry, but when you look back at the show, those social forces remain the reasons why it couldn't be produced today.

Six Feet Under, uncensored, would certainly have no chance of being broadcast either. The politically correct imperative of contemporary American culture would sue and complain it to be another ""wardrobe malfunction."" The malfunction, however, is in the emotional and intellectual dishonesty of most TV shows today, of most mainstream culture today. I think almost all of television is a cartoon. I like Six Feet Under because it is not a does not turn its homosexual characters into the prancing man-boys of Will & Grace. The violence in Six Feet Under is well earned and integral to the drama and comedy of the series. The sex and human relationships in Six Feet Under are complicated and weird, which is completely normal. Mostly, it's refreshing to watch a show that cares about story and character instead of explosions, statutory sex objects, and impossibly melodramatic events.

If All in the Family reflects a political awakening, taught through comedy, then Six Feet Under reflects a response to political correctness. The bigotry that All in the Family responds to is as monolithic and misanthropic as the political correctness Six Feet Under is responding to. Bigotry and political correctness are merely two sides of the same dishonesty; they are rules and codes for human behavior and expression that do not work out in real life. Archie Bunker was certainly not a subtle guy, but his assumptions about people different from him were wrong (and funny). Now, when everything is subtle and on politically correct eggshells, people are no longer honest. That's what Six Feet Under is about to me: We need to relearn how to trust others enough to be honest, and I think Six Feet Under accurately argues that not all honesty is mean, and avoiding confrontation isn't always nice.

In the end, HBO does with Six Feet Under what the networks used to do: Respect the intelligence, maturity, and humanity of the audience.",1171670400,16,2484,4.995169082125604

The sound and picture quality are gorgeous; looking and sounding delish even without a fancy TV. However, at the this price point I expect a lot more featurettes, commentaries and behind the scenes footage. I don't understand why HBO charges so much, but I was lucky, I caught a special at a local retailer and got all 5 seasons for 100.00 bucks. Also if you're only seeing the show on Bravo you are missing out. I have seen two Bravo eps and I cringed at the bad dubbing and editing. It's definitely worth owning if you enjoy the show but try to catch it on the cheap; it's a series that tends to go on sale a lot and HBO did drop the price on the first three seasons to something around fifty dollars. The show is great and I have no complaints about that but I wanted to review the actual DVD collections for those who, like me want to know exactly what they are getting for their hard earned cash.",1166918400,,1027,4.298969072164948
1795193,5,B00006NT1R,"I am watching Six Feet Under, as it is re-run on Bravo TV. I have TiVo, and this sweetens my experience of watching it. I imagine buying it would be just as pleasureful, except I would probably not be able to go to work or sleep until I finished it! As it is, I watch 2 episodes per week.

I am not an experienced reviewer, but if you want to know if you are like me or not, I am a 65 year old, Caucasian, liberal, English BA, ex-hippy, Master's level, addictions therapist, who spent much of her child-raising years (3 kids) with no TV - on purpose - husband in accord. I was brought up by educated people; my father was a psychiatrist. I hate almost all situation comedies except for Cheers and Frasier. If you are not much like the person I describe, you might disregard or disagree with this brief review.

I find this series the best entertainment I have ever watched on TV. The combination of humor and tragedy, and the gradual development of the characters as they verbalize their thoughts and feelings about the common problems of the lives of thoughtful people, keeps me thinking about the past week's episodes until the next episodes air. ""Dysfunctional family,"" a phrase often used to describe the Fishers, is not my prime way of thinking of that family. It's just people of this day and age - and a great variety, also - from other world cultures, from a variety of cultures in THIS country, of hetero and homosexual bents, concerning all stages of life, from the very conservative to the wildly zany. What a feast! Not only do we focus on the Fisher family and their friends and associates, but every week we get a gem-like peek into the heart of other families - the people whose loved-one has died and is being prepared for the viewing (usually) and the funeral.

The camera work, the scenes, the numerous twists of plot, of ironies, and of glimpses of the ""truths"" of life are all pleasureful to the senses and to the mind. The subtlety is always delightful. I give this series so far credit for desensitizing me somewhat to the feeling of horror regarding the viewing of a corpse, and (not that this should be in the same sentence,) the sight of the loving kissing between two gay men - which has come to feel as nice to me as viewing the fond kissing of a heterosexual couple.

I'll be sorry when all the episodes are over and the Fishers are no longer members of my inner family.",1166140800,4,2398,4.443181818181818
1795194,5,B00006NT1R,"After I had finished watching the pilot on Bravo (I don't have HBO) I was instantly enticed by the shows gripping storylines, likeable charactors, and amazing acting. So, instead of waiting for the next episode on Monday, I ran to Hollywood Video and rented the entire first season and over the course of a month, finished the entire season.

The series begins with the death of the man that runs Fisher and Sons funeral home, Nathaniel Fisher. As they say, ""nothing brings a family better together than death"", Nathaniel Jr. flies from Seattle (Peter Krause), Ruth, with her recently destroyed potroast (Frances Conroy), David, with his numerous distractions (Michael Hall), and Claire, who's high on crystal meth (Lauren Ambrose) are binded together by the recent loss of a husband and father. The pilot itself is one of the best things I've seen on television, or in a theatre for that matter. The only thing about the season that bothered me were the funeral supplies commercials, and I'm glad they did away with those in the beginning (they were humorous, just a little distracting).

Throughout the course of the season, there is a period where it does get a little dull, but of course the show redeems itself. A few episodes that really stand out for me are:

Pilot:

This episode was flawless. Everything about it was enjoyable, and like I said, one of the best things I've seen on television, or in a theatre for that matter. I especially liked the ending, that was when I knew I had to finish the rest of the season.

The Trip (Episode 11):

Very humourous and enjoyable. I liked the pregression of Billy and Brenda's relationship.

A Private Life (Episode 12):

Best episode of the season (Pilot was a close second). Everything was brilliant, especially Billy's storyline. Poor guy.

Those episodes that didn't stand out:

Familia (Episode 4)

I didn't care for the 'gangster' storyline, it got a little dull.

Overall, I'd highly reccomend this season to anyone. There are some diversity issues, so not everyone will be able to enjoy this because some people are offended by some of the shows content.

MPAA Rating: TV-MA (No Discriptions)

My Rating: 16+ for Sexual content, including brief nudity, coarse language, some scenes of violence, including grotesque imagery, and some drug content/references.

Notes: I think this series is appropriate for mature teenagers. Charactors drink and smoke, and there is occasional usage of majiuana, and one or two uses of crystal meth and cocaine. There is some suggestive dialouge, sex scenes (some graphic), and nudity (male and female). Charactors swear, however I don't really think of it as a big issue since most teenagers hear these words every day. There is some violence, but the thing that might frighten some sensitive viewers are some scenes involving mutilated bodies.",1165536000,6,2835,4.976694915254237
1795205,4,B00006NT1R,"The wonderful thing about cable TV is that it can get away with a lot more than primetime television. Most people know this from watching such things as THE SOPRANOS. Sex, drugs, gore. Nothing is ""too much"" for them.

And SIX FEET UNDER follows this example but by focusing on the Fisher family, a truly messed up group of undertakers who own/operate a funeral home in southern California.

Each episode opens with the death of someone, and this sets up the premise for that week's show.

The very first episode starts with the death of the Fisher patriarch, Nathanial Fisher (Richard Jenkins, RUMOR HAS IT). He's driving home a new hearse when it is struck by a bus, killing him instantly. He leaves behind his wife Ruth (Frances Conroy, THE AVIATOR), his eldest son David (Michael C. Hall, PAYCHECK), his younger son Nate (Peter Krause, THE TRUMAN SHOW), and high school daughter Claire (Lauren Ambrose, PARTY OF FIVE TV series). This was a very effective way to get ""into"" the Fisher family from a viewer's standpoint. Nothing pulls a family together like the death of one of its closest members. Although they were coming together anyway for Christmas, the Fisher's are now forced to deal with each other on a very tight level. David has been working at the funeral home all his life and feels that his life may have been wasted. He also has to deal with his homosexuality and his inability to ""come out of the closet"" to his family and friends. His love for officer Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick, REUNION TV series) is felt throughout the series, and is on and off thanks to David's psychological hurdles. Matriarch Ruth comes out to the family on her own as she tells them about an affair she'd been having for some time with a hairdresser (male); this comes out during the viewing of her husband as he awaits internment.  Younger son Nate gets news of his father's death while having sex with a stranger (Rachel Griffiths, VERY ANNIE MARY) in an airport maintenance closet. We soon learn that her name is Brenda and with her comes an entirely new set of baggage for Nate in the form of love and a relationship he never thought possible. And finally we get young daughter Claire, a highschooler who learns of her father's death immediately after trying crystal meth for the first time.

What made the show initially entertaining and oh-so-watchable, is the effects of death on all the characters. They deal with everyone else's grief better than their own, as they are distant from it; it's a business. But as the series rolls on, Nate learns that they are here to do more than business. The dead visit the family in ethereal form, teaching them very tough lessons (from how to stand up for yourself, to dealing with a SIDS death). Even the family's father Nathaniel, who started out dead in the beginning episode, turns up at crossroads and tries to help them deal with difficulties.

The series starts out with a bang and keeps going for the first several episodes. Most viewers will be glued to their TV's, wondering what's going to happen next; a tribute to writer/director Alan Ball. But toward the latter half of the first season the series goes a bit astray. The initial enjoyment of watching how death affects the family is swapped for a more soap opera style plot that delves into how the characters effect other characters. Although this isn't horrible, it isn't as gripping as the show's initial premise. Gone are the dead's visitations (mostly), as are the quirky commercials for hearse sales and corpse foundation putty.

But even with these issues there's still a certain pull that the series has thanks to some strong writing and the deadly subject matter. The big question, though, is is it worth going on to season two?",1163721600,3,3746,4.727411944869831

I had heard about SFU, and being curious about the days and nights of a family that owns a funeral home, I bought it. HBO charges an arm and a leg for 13 episodes, so I got mine used, which is fine by me. I immediately fell in love with the fishers, and the people who by grim circumstances happen to wander in and out of their lives. I like the 1950's throwback decoration of the house, and the struggles that the brothers have at first when they have to share the responsibility of the business after the death of their father. The ""ghosts"" that talk to the characters, are maybe their own consciences or a higher power either way, it's an amazing way to tell their stories and show their fears. I wasn't a huge fan of Rachel Griffiths, I had seen her in Muriel's Wedding and wanted to take piano wire to her neck, but this character deserved someone who was both hardened and soft of heart and soul and she pulls it off wonderfully. This season introduces us all to the family dynamic, the controlling mother who has a problem censoring her thoughts, the gay brother with the gorgeous boyfriend whom he alienates by not being open, the prodigal son who is forced to face his demons and finds true love maybe, the little sister who isn't so innocent (she sucks toes) and is desperate for someone to ""need"" her, and the talented embalmer who isn't blood family, yet feels as though he owes them his loyalty. You get to see dead people, but not so much in a way that makes you turn your head, you look out of curiosity and fascination, and in the case of the dead porn star laugh out loud. The episode with the baby was the only one that made me shrink into the couch. I like the story line of the struggling family owned business trying to be forced to sell to the giant corporation Kronos, its humorous yet appropriate for our times.

I can attest to how people interact with one another without understanding why. Ball does an excellent job in capturing that. And the fact that he gives credit to those around him concerning the development and layers of the lives of the Fisher family and those who orbit their existence, in capturing a unique window into what it is like to have flaws, shows how great a film maker he is.

1795212,5,B00006NT1R,"Six Feet Under is the first American TV show I watched and loved. I'd seen some sit-coms and dramas before, ones that are hard not to see, even outside the US (Friends, Seinfeld, Sex and the City, etc.), but none of them struck me as true and real as SFU did. Going far beyond being true and real, SFU shows us moments that are disturbingly profound where we cannot but seriously examine our own lives along with those of the characters. In this regard, I think what Virginia Woolf said of a Shakespeare tragedy (Macbeth? Othello?) equally applies to SFU. Watch it once every year, and you will have a deeper understanding of life.

I love each and every episode of SFU of all 5 seasons, but if I have to pick one favorite from the 1st season, it would be ""The Room."" Here, we, along with Nate, encounter the hidden, unknown aspects of Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. Nate remembers his recently deceased father as being manipulative, domineering, and retreating. So, it is with surprise and confusion that he embarks on the pursuit of knowing what his father was really like. Although he has glimpses of his father as a witty, wicked, weird, great guy, him now being dead, there's no way to know for certain.

The episode is strongly suggestive of Paul Auster's The Invention of Solitude, equally pervaded with sadness and despair of not really knowing what our father was like, as a person. It contains one of the most memorable quotes from the show as well. When Nate gets to have a brief conversation with his father (the ""ghost"" of Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. appears at important moments througout the show) about the meaning of life, his father sums up the futility of pursuing such question by saying: ""Life is wasted on the living."" I often thought of this moment while I was reading Plato's Phaedo, another unabashedly serious investigation of the ""meaning of life"" and ""afterlife.""",1144713600,2,1876,4.716463414634147

The church appears to be Episcopal - the clergy person is referred to as the rector and is addressed as Father. The Book of Common Prayer is visible in David's ""ordination"" ceremony, and portions of the litany for ordinations are used there as well. But no Episcopal deacon is recruited, vetted and ordained in the space of a few weeks, nor would the ordination have been conducted by the parish clergy.

1795226,5,B00006NT1R,"It should be praised as some kind of a miracle: SFU is a TV series that makes current Hollywood productions seem shallow and somehow unnecessary -- it has more courage, humour and zest than any of the recent Oscar-catching so-called 'major pictures' (THE HOURS excluded).

Let alone homosexuality, SFU has enough courage to admit that there's something called death, and that it IS part of our experience as human beings: how many Hollywood films remind us of this fact in any serious way? The Fishers face multitude of difficult questions and perhaps the greatest success of the creators is that not a single episode seems phony or preconceived. If you're watching, for example, films by Stanley Kramer, then you definitely KNOW why they were made: to RAISE SOCIAL QUESTIONS. Once raised, they could have as well been forgotten, for no one cares for an effort that is perfunctory. But SFU is a diffrent story: the series actually deals with many so-called 'social questions', but not for the mere act of 'dealing', but for a purpose, which is - pardon my French - meditation on the very meaning of life and death.

And the actors -- oh! can they be praised too much? David Fisher at times reminds me of this malicious puppet from DEAD OF NIGHT, and at others seems even more lovable then this blond chubby boy of THE SOUND OF MUSIC (the one who sings 'You are sixteen, going on seventeen'). Nate is funny and surprisingly normal (if compared to the rest of the family). Keith makes you feel safe, for you know that he's the ultimate good cop (he's GOOD in more things than mere 'stand and protect' buisness...). There are so many others, namely Angela, that make you love the entire series even more.

1795228,5,B00006NT1R,"Thank God for DVDs.  We do not have cable in our household, and so we often hear about these great shows on HBO or basic cable, but don't get to see them when they first come out.  DVD sets allow my wife and I a great chance to catch up, whether with terrific comedies (CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, RENO 911) or dramas (SOPRANOS), or, in wonderful case of SIX FEET UNDER, a strange, nearly sublime combination of the two.

By sublime, I don't simply mean ""good.""  Sublime implies something that creates a feeling of ease or relaxation.  A good meal can be sublime.  And the lovely gelling of the ridiculous and the ordinary, the laughable with the tragic, is what makes SIX FEET UNDER so good.

It's a treat to be able to watch the series essentially in a bunch.  Although we don't have time for a marathon session (watching them all in one day, for example) we do manage one episode every couple of days.  So the emerging story feels great.

Creator Alan Ball mixed similar comedic/tragic events in the terrific film AMERICAN BEAUTY.  SIX FEET UNDER explores similar topics of family members at dis-ease with each other...locked into relationships that prevent the individual from persuing their dreams...which Ball would have us believe is the source of our follies and our unhappiness.  We do silly, funny, wacky things do allow ourselves to have some ""fun"" or pursue a personal goal that might not mesh with what everyone else in our immediate social system wants.  We also do foolhardy, dangerous and regrettable things for the same reasons.  In the process, we bounce off those closest to us, sometimes harmoniously, sometimes destructively or hurtfully.  What's great about SIX FEET UNDER is that the creators understand that these two conditions happen SIMULTANEOULSY.  To the person they are happening to, it may not feel that way, but for a compassionate observer, the pain is leavened by humor...and the dark humor is shot through with anguish.  GOOD STUFF.

The show is sharply written, and wonderfully cast.  Peter Krause and Michael Hall as the two VERY different brothers are quite good.  They don't have any problems showing their ugly or at least unattractive sides, but we are able to see the goodness beneath the squabbling.  Frances Conroy is wonderfully insane as the mother.  Richard Jenkins (deserving of Oscar nomination for NORTH COUNTRY) as the dead father is laconic, ironic, bitter and very funny.  I think the best discovery may be Lauren Ambrose as the teenage sister.  Ignored by the rest of her much older family, she may just be too smart for the room.  Certainly, she's too smart for her school.  A character like this (goofy clothing, unusual car [a green hearse!], smart-ass mouth) sounds quite clich&eacute;d...but in this young lady's hands, she makes it seem original and BELIEVABLE.  We see that she's very smart and observant, but also, that she is a kid experiencing some pretty adult things for the first time...on her own.

I also love the theme music.

Very small downsides:  we know this is a fractured family, but when they lose their father very suddenly, there should be more signs of grief, or at least mixed emotions.  Instead, they mostly seem put off by the inconvenience.  Even people who are estranged from their parents almost always muster up more emotion when faced with a sudden death.  And yes, I know they're in the funeral business, but that's like saying a doctor can't get emotional over his/her own illness.  Also, the key plot point of the ""large funeral-home conglomerate"" working so hard to drive them out of business is to me a bit cartoonish...an awkwardly concealed dig at Wal-Mart and its ilk.  I don't mind the idea of competition from a big corporation...it's the Machiavellian machinations that don't quite fit.  These are minor quibbles, though.

We both enjoy the show immensely.  It's been said before, but because it's true, I'll say it again...there's nothing else quite like SIX FEET UNDER.  I've only seen Season 1, but can't wait to dive into the second...and third...and fourth!!",1130976000,5,4056,4.891495601173021

Fascinating, emotive and witty storylines all beautifully acted and very memorable - they disturb my sleep frequently.  A brilliantly crafted series that is visually and psychologically fascinating.

This series is quite well done.  The acting is great, the story line is absolutely addicitive.  Once I was hooked by this first season, I have anxiously awaited season after season.  For a pretty much non-TV watcher, that is pretty good.  I cannot go as far as some reviewers in stating that this is the absolute best show ever made, but it is good and well worth watching.  Actually, I found that watching it a second time was as much fun as the first, maybe more so, in that I missed so much the first time around.  Please do keep in mind that this is an adult show and not one that I would feel comfortable with watching it with my preteen grand children.  It is certainly adult entertainment.

1795247,5,B00006NT1R,"Welcome to the world of Fisher & Sons.  This is an amazing immersive experience watching this series.  The acting is unparalleled; the cinematography is superior to any theatrical release you'll typically see; great casting; great music; simply wonderful.

Not since Northern Exposure has a cast of characters been so interesting and dynamic. What's really great about this series is how it centers around the metaphors of life and death and a family and friends struggling to make sense of it all.  If someone told you an idea for a series that is based on the operators of a funeral home, you'd probably gag, but it turns out to be the perfect setting to address a myriad of social, emotional and intellectual issues.

One thing you notice among the reviews here is that people either love it or don't understand it (and thus write the series off as whiny, self-indulgant hype, which is quite ironic - perhaps they were expecting more explosions and car chases?).  Since the show has some gay characters which are often portrayed as responsible, positive (yet often struggling) role models, homophobes will undoubtedly fixate on this and not get beyond it.  Like reality, the characters make mistakes and bad decisions, but unlike the movies, things are not always conveniently resolved, which is a refreshing breeze in comparison to the shallow tripe elsewhere.  This is a show about life, and SFU proves that there's no better way to understand what life is all about without embracing death.  Brilliant.

Some shows entertain you; but a true work of art will make you think; will change your perspective.  SFU does that.  You will not be the same after you watch this series.  I agree with others here that there is no better television series that I've ever seen to date.

The first two seasons are spectacular.  The next two seem to slow down a bit.  It seems as if the writers stretched one show's worth of plotlines into four or five episodes and dragged things to a crawl.  But the last season has kicked things into gear and will probably appropriately book-end what is unquestionably one of the best, if not the best dramatic series of all time.

From the first episode, I found that I really cared about seeing what happened to all the characters, but particularly Claire. Claire's character is very dynamic, and it's easy to see that she is not an ""underachiever"", but misunderstood. I think we can all relate to those awkward years of our teens, which must have been worse being labeled the ""freaky"" girl who drives the hearse.

Immediately I was struck by this show as being one made for people who think they're sophisticated viewers of ""quality TV"" (an oxymoron if there ever was one), when really they're just Couch Potatoes. It's the faux 'hipness', which essentially amounts to people being rude and insensitive toward one another. I would sooner live in the Montana wilderness a la Unabomber than among cold creatures like these. Nevertheless I must grant it three stars because all of the actors play their parts well; at least I certainly hope it's an act. The 'Brenda' character and  family especially should have KEEP AWAY messages tattooed on them. But again, the series is better than Alan Ball's nightmare of a movie, ""American Beauty"". The only reason I had the misfortune of suffering through that disaster is because I was a guest in someone's home.

I enjoyed the first season on DVD having never seen it on HBO and I don't think I ever got up to do anything else.  I devoured all 13 episodes immediately went looking for season 2.

1795253,5,B00006NT1R,"It's been a while that I have found a television show that I love. It never looked very interesting to me. Why would you want to watch a show with this subject matter? Why, indeed.

At the beginning of every show, there is usually someone who dies and it can go from the normal, to strange. One woman smacks her non-stop talking husband over the head with a pan then goes on to eat her breakfast. She claimed that he was ""boring."" Usually, that client is brought to the funeral home, and we are introduced to the characters.

In the first episode, the owner and father of this family, dies. His sons (ie, Fisher and sons) are left to take over the business. David, who is the responsible one of the family tries to manage the home while hiding his boyfriend on the side. Nate comes back from Seattle to help out his brother and meets Brenda, on the same day his dad dies. They quickly become a couple without much thought. Claire, still in highschool, seems to have missed a lot since she's a lot younger. She is a creative sort who drives a green hearse and is mostly a loner at school. My favorite character of all would be the mom, Ruth. You look at this woman who seems as if she could live in Victorian times. The more you get to know her, the more you know she is anything but Victorian.

She is hilarious, constantly trying to get to know her children, catching up on what she missed. Her whole lifetime with them seemed to pass by when she wasn't paying attention.

I have nothing to say but good things about this show. All of the characters have some aspect of likability to them (including those that I found annoying beforehand--Lauren Ambrose has redeemed herself in my eyes.)

The whole dysfunctional aspect keeps it interesting and the friends of the family, boyfriends, girlfriends, etc, are all amazing actors as well.

Well acted and never boring, I'm now obsessed and trying to get through all of the episodes that I missed.

1795265,4,B00006NT1R,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the overuse of the F word.  I have no problem with profanity or nudity if it's something that is necessary in the storyline, but almost every character uses the F word in almost every scene!  At least it seems that way to me.  They also try to throw in nudity wherever possible, and it's really not necessary.  Aside from that gripe, this is the best TV series I've seen in a long time, aside from Joan of Arcadia (how's that for opposite ends of the spectrum???  LOL!)

The show does not strive for happy endings or easy wrap-ups.  It goes for the jugular or the heart until you're on the edge of your seat...and then you either breathe a sigh of relief or go crashing over that cliff.  Brilliant!!!

I am so thankful to whoever donates the DVD sets to the public library, or I would've never seen the show.

The first season of the show describes the lives of the Fisher clan in the aftermath of the death of the patriarch, Nathaniel. The Fisher family business is in the ""death care"" industry as it is described in the show. Although this may seems like a mundane topic, the events and characters of the show ring true to real life in many ways.

The acting on the series is superb as is the cinematography. HBO truly is in a league of its own. The special features for the set are not fantastic. However, owning the complete first season is well worth the cost of the set.

Unfortunately, I don't have HBO, therefore, only could get glimpses of this show as well as ""The Sopranos"" from awards shows.  Thank goodness for DVDs.  Not knowing what to expect, I thought that my curiosity would be satisfied with the first episode and that I'd go on to something else.  Wrong!  I found this show absolutely mesmerizing.  All of the cast members and guest stars are perfectly matched to their characters. I've found that I've fallen in love with the Fishers as I did in a very different way with the Sopranos. The characters are completely well defined.  Nate is the sensitive one still searching for his place in the world.  David is the very uptight, straight-laced middle child by day and the tormented, self destructive homosexual by night.  Claire, the youngest, is still an enigma to me.  She seems to hide her true brilliance underneath a tough exterior and a facade of mediocrity  and freakishness. But...the one character that truly shines for me is the matriarch, Ruth, played incomparably by Frances Conroy, who is prudishly proper one minute and radiantly sensual the next.  When she is on the screen, I can't take my eyes off of her  afraid that I'll miss some subtle, meaningful gesture.

Needless to say, I love this show.  If you don't have any problems with death and don't mind the ""f-bomb"" being dropped every five minutes, you'll love it as well.

I enjoy the way the father speaks from the grave to each family member and former employee. This builds in subtle layers of why the family and the funeral business has grown in its quirky way.
The story line is of course about the meaning of death and life and how people interprete its inevitability - denial.

I sat down with my boyfriend, who has been putting off watching these episodes since I got them, and within twenty minutes of the pilot he was hooked. We just moved and have no basic cable, so we depend on DVDs during dinner...we spent four nights watching Season 1 and he is now counting down the days until we order the Season 2 set.

SFU is unlike any other show I've seen. Television gets harder and harder to watch these days, saturated with reality tv and repetitive sitcoms. It's hard to find something as refreshing as Six Feet Under to really get under your skin. Alan Ball has a way of making you feel like you know and care about the characters, and you leave each episode feeling like if you don't watch the next, something will happen without you.

The cinematography is what really grabbed me. Each episode is beautiful to watch and is filled with amazing colors and camera angles and sybolism.

But above all else, the cast is what truly holds this masterpiece together. Everyone is so convincing. Whoever decided on the final cast should be rewarded heavily, because I don't think the show would be the same without them.

1795288,5,B00006NT1R,"Six Feet Under is one of those shows that will suck you in and become highly addictive by the end of the first episode.  The show revolves around the Fishers who operate a family owned funeral home.  All of the characters stand out and develop greatly on this show.  Sometimes you will watch this show and you will laugh up a storm other times you will watch it and the emotion makes you want to cry.
Six Feet Under is written by Alan Ball and he directed American Beauty. American Beauty is one of my favorite movies and there are a few similarities in between both.  When I say similarities I mean that both American Beauty have a great sense of dark humor and great drama.  I found both of Alan Ball's works to be one that make you sit back and reflect on life.  After watching American Beauty you look around for the beauty of things on earth and in life.  The same applies with Six Feet Under but questions are brought up like ""Why do we have to die"".  I liked American Beauty and I felt right at home with Six Feet Under.
The characters in this show are relatable and even though they have a different way of making a living I still found them relatable. The main characters I would say are Nate, David, Ruth, Claire, & Nate Sr.  Of course they are the Fisher family who own the funeral home.  Another few huge character on this show are Brenda and her brother Billy.  Of course there are other big characters but I can't name everyone.
In the pilot episode the Nate Sr. dies in a horrible bus accident and he has to hand over the funeral home to his two sons Nate and David Fisher.  Even though he his dead Nate Sr. watches over his family and communicates with his family.  Alot of the scenes he appears in are hilarious.  Oh ya did I mention he is dead!  His sons both have good developing characters who are very different in their own ways.  David Fisher is a cool character who is very businesslike and is also gay.  He has a boyfriend named Keith is a cop. You will find there relationship evolve as the season goes on.  The other brother Nate, has never worked a day in the funeral business because he left for Seattle to pursue his own life.  Nate is a pretty cool character but his world is in a blender with the passing of his father and his relationship with his newly met girlfriend Brenda.  His girlfrend Brenda in my opinion is the star of the show.  She is full of crazy/cool energy and always has an appetite for sex.  You never know what to expect with her character.  The mother, Ruth Fisher is kinda of a control freak who seems very depressed, worn out, and saddened over the loss over her husband.  She snaps very quickly and she is too a memorable character.  Finally the Claire Fisher is another cool character.  She is the youngest of the bunch and she is a teenager in high school.  She is somewhat of a loner but she has alot of character and she is far from ordinary.  She drives a freakin hearse to school!!!  Enough about the characters I can't spill everything out or I will spoil the season for you.
I know what your thinking.  Your like well ok thats great Adam but you know what, if I come home with this the wife will have my head on a platter.  I will admit it is pricey but I think Six Feet Under is a great enough show to where the quality over shadows the price.  It is on HBO so there is alot swearing, sex and other stuff you would never see on regular television.  I think HBO produces great television shows.  Just watch The Sopranos, Sex & The City, Oz or many of there other series.  You know it is quality and they are great television.  Well guess what Six Feet Under plays on that same field.  I find it to be my 3rd favorite television show behind 24 and the Sopranos.
Well let me conclude by saying you will be satisfied with Season One of Six feet Under.  I haven't seen the other seasons of this show but I will definetly be buying Season 2 when it is released in June.  If you like quality acting, drama, and dark humor give this show a shot.",1079222400,3,4001,4.249006622516556

""To make life important.""
Wow, so simple, yet so profound. This show is just full of stuff like this. The show begins traumatically with the death of the father right before a family reunion/Christmas dinner.  We then follow the sons, Nate and David, the daughter Claire an the widow Ruth, try to restart their lives after such a loss. Each person has their own faults and try to work through everything. All of this takes place in the middle of the family business, a funeral parlor.  Periodically they will have visitors who seem like ghosts, but who are not. Like the other great HBO drama, the Sopranos, this show is equal parts comedy and tragedy. Sometimes you laugh sometimes you cry.  But is always enthralling.
About the DVD: Nothing too special about the special features. A few interviews and commentary tracks. The greatness of the show itself makes is so these little extras are not necessary.

Life is six feet under when afterlife is beyond death.
The entire casting crews are incredibly perfect. Peter Krause and Rachel Griffith (Nate Fisher and Brenda Chenowith) are visually compatible to be convinced as an inseparatable item. Frances Conroy and Lauren Ambrose (Ruth and Claire Fisher) look exactly like mother and daughter. Jeremy Sisto (Billy Chenowith) is the indulgent but psychiatric self-made artist and, again, looks exactly like the twin brother of Griffith (Brenda). Michael C. Hall (David Fisher)'s profile strove far beyond realistic as a split personality underneath a typical uptight workaholic. Freddy Rodriguez (David's petite sized assistant Federico Diaz) is blessed with the finest Latino boyish charm that steals the side stream of the show more than anything else. And Richard Jenkins (dad Nathaniel Fisher) is, what can I say, absolutely brilliant for his role.
Thanks to the ever edgy but classic Allan Ball (American Beauty). This first season of the HBO original programme deserves more than winnings and nominations in Golden Globe, GLADD, Grammys etc year 2002.

This is also one of the bravest shows on the air. While many TV shows are content to waste hours doing nothing or blowing things up, this show tackles difficult topics with an unbiased eye: homosexuality, religion, death, and life itself. The DVD packaging is also worthy of mention: although it's bulky, it is a cool concept and looks nice on the shelf when it fits.

A coffee table book about fictional characters containing their fictional journal entries, fictional artwork, and I presume, some fictional e-mails and such.
Look, I love the Fishers as much as the next guy, but a collectors book is something you whip out when the series is a long-cancelled and wistful bit of neo-nostalgia and you have literally NOTHING ELSE UP YOUR SLEEVE!
Get season 2 out on DVD already! And for that matter, when will we be seeing season 4? HBO is so busy whipping up cool lifestyle accessories that it doesn't seem to notice that people are starting to forget all about it.

1795306,5,B00006NT1R,"This is a truly amazing series. I started watching it about a year ago, in the middle of series 2 when it was airing at 10pm on E4. I watched one episode and basically thought WTF?, but because my friend watched and worshipped it, I decided to watch it again, and since I understood more of the story, from then I was completely hooked.
The release of series 1 on DVD meant that I could, for the first time, watch the first-ever episode, and see where everything started. This series is outstanding (just look at the billions of awards it has won!!). The characters are the most human of any television series or film I have ever seen. Everything they do is understandable, and you really feel for them. You can sympathise with all their problems and quirks, and starting each episode with a death that the rest of the episode focuses around is a nice touch.  I watched the first three episodes a couple of days after I received this box-set for Christmas, and then I watched all the others in one day, solidly. (Well, I had a lot of time on my hands) I couldn't stop watching, I was totally engrossed. I would pick out my favourite character... but I love them all. It is really fascinating following Claire's experiments with drugs and her strange relationship with Gabriel, David's repressed homosexuality and his umm... 'messed-up' love life, and Brenda and Nate's relationship, or more accurately, the triangle between Brenda, Nate, and Brenda's brother. Brenda's past is so... well, freaky...there are a lot of secrets about her and her brother that are unearthed over the course of series 1 and they are really shocking.
That is the great thing about Six Feet Under. There are some moments that keep you on the edge of your seat, some moments that will make you cry, and some moments that will make you laugh out loud. Not many series can do this, or do this as well as Six Feet Under can. One of the best episodes in my opinion is the third episode, 'The Foot'. Just watch it to find out what happens... the title is a big hint heh heh...",1072656000,,2046,4.52972972972973

Neither did I....but now I know.

This family, struggling to survive an unexpected tragedy and move on, will likely inspire you...and you'll soon forget that their basement is laden with corpses.",1071532800,,623,4.867924528301887

Not having cable myself, I would go to a friend's house to watch it every Sunday night.  I was hooked from the very first time I saw it.  I love the honesty of the characters and the interaction of a real family who are lovable, but real.  I like the ongoing plot with the family that is mysterious and just messed up... like real families are.
The mini-plots that happen weekly with the ""customers"" of the funeral home are so inventive and refreshing.  It makes every episode fresh and alive and unpredictable.  The opening scenes are troublesome as I sit on pins and needles trying to figure out who died or was about to.  So not only do I get to be a ""part"" of the Fisher family as I get to know each of them intimately, I can also glimpse a variety of dysfunctional families more as an outside observer.

Perhaps it's just me, but Six Feet Under is the closest thing I have seen to real life on TV.  No, I don't live in a funeral home, I never lost a parent, or had sex in an airport.  What makes Six Feet Under such a beautiful series is it's intensity, sprinkled with humor and hope. Real life is serious.  It's sad.  It's hard.  But even at our worst moments, life is a gift, it's humorous, and touching, and beautiful.  SFU captures this delicate balance wonderfully.  This show will make you laugh and cry within minutes of each other.  The characters are so bold and alive, thanks to one of the most excellent casts ever assembled for a series.

But I almost always get into a series after few episodes or as in the case of Sopranos and Friends after a couple of seasons. Never,was I hooked from the very first episode to any series as I was on Six Feet Under.
Words can not justly describe how wonderful it is,but I will try anyway,otherwise this would be one short and empty review!
It is truly addictive, and this is not by chance: The writing is wonderfully superior, the acting and direction are above average: A morbid setting, a dysfunctional family,very colourful and distinctly different characters, dialogue that is at times funny at others poignant,and a plot that has some unexpected twists and development. This is all tied together by a sort of Lynchian surrealism and dream like flow.
As I meantioned above,all the actors are brilliant, but one in particular gave Six Feet Under an indirect and invaluable boost, Rachel Griffiths: her character is neurotic,complex, pretty, naughty and very sexy.
Six Feet Under is a series that I hope will continue for several seasons to come, one that on no account should be missed. This is one positive addiction!",1065571200,2,1341,4.7106382978723405
1795312,5,B00006NT1R,"I had the privilege of coming to the DVD set of ""Six Feet Under"" without ever having seen any episodes on television prior to that. This allowed me to not have the (annoying, though effective) hindrance of waiting a week or more for a new episode, and the end result of ""Six Feet""'s first season is spectacular. Within season one, the various writers and directors juggle numerous plot strands that seem to get more interesting each episode, and have the classic peaks and valleys of any great drama writing. This is no ""put-people-on-a-desert-island (on in this case, a funeral home) and-see-what-happens"" stunt, as some may think. This is television drama at its best - don't be put off by the contuining gag of a new death at the beginning of each episode - much more richness lies in the hour that follows it. What may be most interesting about the show, and even more than its constantly great intertwining plots, has to be the way that actors Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, and Rachel Griffiths evolve their characters. Krause proves to be an excellent lead, and the arc of his change from prodigal son to man of the house could be the show's most well-fleshed character trait. Hall alternates between staunch professionalism and childlike sexual desire, and his character is only aided by his at-first hidden homosexuality. Griffiths is often the comedic relief of the show in her own quirky and care-free way, but the show's writers don't let her get off easily. As Krause's girlfriend, she steadily draws him into a web of secrets and psychological games aided by her severely disturbed brother and psychiatrist parents. All of these characters are fantastic in their own way, but the two red-heads of the show, Frances Conroy and Lauren Ambrose, are the best. Ambrose often has the burden of the emotional weight of an episode as its only teenaged family member, and the way that the family's experiences interact with her constantly mixed-up life give her an opportunity to display her unusually prodigious talent of stealing the show not with comedy, but with honest, moving acting. This leaves Frances Conroy, the most unforgettable and enduring character on the show, and also the family's matriarch. A veteran of Arthur Miller and Woody Allen, she is THE character one can't take their eyes from. Sure, she may not have as many scenes as the others, but time and time again, she handles her material with the grace and skill that every great actress should. This may be a stretch here, but Conroy may be the great, overlooked joy of television today. She certainly is the finest actress in the business. Conroy and the amazing cast that help her shape ""Six Feet Under"" prove to be the finest ensemble cast on, yes, the finest drama on television today.",1064275200,,2799,4.857740585774058

Unfortunately, it has ruined me for most network television. The writing is superb. The show is always unpredictable and captivating, and yet nothing that happens ever just feels like a stunt. It is beautifully acted by the entire cast. Instead of stock characters, the people who inhabit this world appear as three dimensional, flawed, tragic, comic, and beautiful human beings. Instead of being a ""show about nothing"", the trend started by Seinfeld that pretty much every show since seems to be imitating, Six Feet Under is the opposite: it's a show about everything. Life, death, love, God, religion, family, sexuality, tragedy, comedy ... it's all covered. I know I'm gushing, but when you've been fed a steady diet of [garbage] for so long and something gourmet comes along ... it's hard not to.

1795324,5,B00006NT1R,"I am HBO deprived. Since I don't watch much TV, getting this popular cable channel was never an issue. Recently I took out the entire first season of ""Six Feet Under"" on DVD, and may reconsider my HBO decision. I am hooked on this exceptional series, one of the best I have ever seen on television. (except I viewed it on DVD).
The Fisher family owns and runs a funeral home, the setting for this unique series. Each episode begins with a death, and the subsequent plot revolves around the deceased, preparing the corpse for burial, (which is oddly fascinating), services for the bereaved, and an update on the lives of the extremely interesting Fishers.
Some say that the Fisher family is dysfunctional. I, who have become very in tune with them all, believe that though the individual family members are unusual, to say the least, as a family they function well, and continue to do so and to grow with each new episode. There is palpable love between them, and much effort made to communicate with each other, and to understand and accept one another. The Fisher family and friends are a pure delight!
Unfortunately, the first episode deals with the sudden death of Fisher family patriarch, Nathaniel, on Christmas Eve. Ruth, dedicated wife, mother and control freak, loses it when she learns of her husband's accidental death, and in her hysteria admits to having a two year affair. Her ""other man"" takes her camping, an activity she adores, and which she has had to forego being married to an undertaker with little time, and little love, for the outdoors.
The eldest son, Nate, escaped the family and the family's business at an early age, by leaving home right after school. He is on his way to the family manse in Los Angles, for the holidays, but presently resides in Seattle, where he runs a natural foods co-op. Handsome, still single, in his mid-thirties, Nate is literally closeted at the airport, having wild sex with a dynamic woman he met on the plane, when his cell phone rings and he is informed of Dad's death.
Younger brother David has remained at home to work with his father as co-directer of Fisher and Sons Funeral Home. David is a super straight gay man, with a wonderful, but uptight, in-the-closet-relationship with Keith, a member of LAPD's finest. Dave is resentful that Nate was able to get away from everything and everyone Fisher, and that he was stuck with assuming all the responsibility of brother, son, and undertaker.
Claire Fisher, teenage daughter with mega growing pains, frequently steals the show. She is an adorable, artistic, sensitive, talented, underachiever who doesn't fit in with most of the kids at school. One is tempted to say ""Thank God"" to this, but remember, Claire is a teenager who desperately wants to be like everybody else. When she learns of her father's death, she is at an after school ""crystal meth"" session with the in-crowd. Ooops!
Alan Ball, the Oscar winning writer of ""American Beauty,"" has created a masterpiece with ""Six Feet Under."" Amazing as it may seem - everything works in this family drama, that will have you laughing your head off, as much wiping away tears, at some of the brilliantly sensitive, occasionally disturbing, and sometimes profound scenes.
The acting is wonderful, always. Peter Krause as Nate, and Michael C. Hall as David, are appropriately cast as the two brothers who, when not in conflict and competition with each other, are loving, caring men who are trying to grow into brotherhood. Mom Ruth, brilliantly played by Frances Conroy, is a real study in character, as a middle-aged woman who has long been confined in her corseted lifestyle, and longs to break free and tear loose. She is able to transform herself, in the blink of an eye, from an uptight frump to an attractive, sensual woman ready for love and life. And the amazing Lauren Ambrose, as Claire, is luminescent, awkwardly graceful, and so appealing. The series' surprising show-stopper is Rachel Griffith, as Brenda, the lady from the airport closet, who becomes Nate's girlfriend and an essential mamber of the cast.
It is hard to miss with this DVD collection of ""Six Feet Under's"" 1st year. I think history will prove that this one is slated for the Television Hall of Fame. Meanwhile, I have a call to make to my local cable station. I can't wait for next year to watch what happens next!

I was blown away!  From the very first moments of the pilot, I was hooked.  The opening theme music is one of the best ever composed for a television series, and the opening credits are fascinating -- so much so that there's a featurette on the DVD just about the making of the opening credit sequence.
Then there are the characters.  These are not two-dimensional sitcom charicatures; they are very rounded, deep, complicated people.  They actually seem like real people (and a LOT like my own family).
Add the acting to that -- what a great cast!  Every single principal actor on this show is terrific.  As an ensemble, they equal more than the sum of their parts.
That writing!  These are well-crafted episodes.  Each episode tells a couple of self-contained stories, but there's some serialism going on, too, which keeps you coming back for more.
And direction... very fresh and stylized, not the standard TV dramedy fare.
I'm gushing, I know.  This is GOOD TV.  OK, Nate and Brenda's constant cycle of blowing up and making up gets a little tiring, but that's really the only complaint that I have (other than the fact that Season 2 doesn't have a release date yet).",1057104000,,1319,4.637931034482759

Finally, season one was released on dvd and over the course of three days, I watched every episode, enthralled.
The show starts out interesting because of it's quirks but not quite there. Clearly, something is missing in the first few episodes. It keeps your interest because of it's uniqueness. No other show has ever explored death in quite the same way as Six Feet Under, and rarely have you seen the behind the scene workings of a funeral home. But this alone wouldn't sustain the show for long.
Then, and few episodes in, something marvelous happens. The characters truely begin to reveal themselves to you, in all their glory. Each character is deeply troubled in many ways, and what else would you expect in a show that revolves around a death each week, but at the same time, you can relate to each and every one of them.

1795333,5,B00006NT1R,"""Six Feet Under"" is truly one of the finest shows to ever grace the small screen.  Its first season proved to be a very strong start for the provocative HBO series.  Viewers immediately became intrigued with the Fishers, a Los Angeles family who own a funeral home.  When patriarch Nathaniel is killed in an accident, wife Ruth, sons David and Nate, and daughter Claire are forced to suddenly deal with the loss of their beloved, but twisted family member.  The plots center around the family moving on (slowly and emotionally) from their father's death, and then trudging through the issues of their separate lives.
Ruth (Frances Conroy) becomes riddled with guilt for cheating on her husband while he was alive.  Nate (Peter Krause) begrudgingly rejoins his family after his rebellious escape to Seattle and begins a chaotic romance with bizarre Brenda.  David (Michael C. Hall) suffers with the secrecy of his gay life and the responsibility of running the business in his father's absence.  Claire (Lauren Ambrose) is caught up with a bad crowd in school, uses drugs, and has a volcanic relationship with her criminal boyfriend.  They are not the perfect family, which always makes for great drama.
Other characters add depth as outsiders to the Fisher struggles.  Freddy Rodriguez is excellent as Rico, a young embalmer who is trying to decide if staying with Fisher and Sons is the right thing to do.  It goes without saying that Rachel Griffiths is a scene-stealer as Brenda, Nate's dysfunctional massage therapist lover.  She's already won an Emmy and much critical acclaim.  Keith, played by Matthew St. Patrick, is also a unique character.  He is David's lover, but he's not the stereotypical gay man.  He's a huge, authoritative, intimidating police officer.
The plots thicken after the family mourns Nathaniel.  Everything from a monopolizing company's threats to shut Fisher and Sons down to Nate discovering the twisted nature of Brenda's relationship with brother Billy (Jeremy Sisto) lend some soap-opera moments to keep viewers glued to their sets.  One thing you might not expect from such a dark series is all of the humor.  There are many dry jokes and embarassing situations; it's not all death and depression.  Need proof?  Watch the episode involving the foot.  Or simply watch for appearances by the ghost of Nathaniel, who loves commenting on his family's ups and downs.
Overall, this show is a great mix of macabre and humanity.  You'll cry, you'll laugh, and you'll be endlessly fascinated.  This is the most realistic fictional series on television.",1055289600,11,2577,5.07125890736342
1795343,5,B00006NT1R,"It [is bad] not having HBO: I have to wait until TV's most talked-about shows, like ""The Sopranos"", ""Sex and the City"" and ""Oz"", come out on DVD to catch up on all the quality entertainment I'm missing.  The good thing is, once I get started, I don't have to wait a week to catch the next episode.  As I've begun the first season of ""Six Feet Under"", this has proved to be a very good thing indeed.
This show is one of the most grimly funny I've seen in a long time.  The inanity of the funeral home business is given a perfect showcase in this ensemble drama, featuring some of the freshest acting and writing since, well, ""The Sopranos"".  If subplots and supporting characters occasionally seem to be weird strictly for weirdness' sake (the missing foot, Brenda's completely psychotic family), the real family dynamics - frustration, anger, confusion, love despite it all - are a joy to watch.  Though Peter Krause and Michael C. Hall, as brothers Nate and David Fisher, are given top billing and are essentially the main characters, the women steal the show every chance they get.  Frances Conroy is a neurotic joy as befuddled matriarch Ruth, Rachel Griffiths keeps the character of Nate's girlfriend Brenda from falling into the stereotype of complicated woman/child (which, in the hands of a lesser actress, would be especially noticeable in this airtight ensemble), and Lauren Ambrose is, to me, the true star as Claire, the youngest and most openly rebellious of the Fisher clan.  Ambrose does wonders as a conflicted teenager looking for meaning in the senselessness of death and grief she lives with.  This show is addictive; I've watched, on average, four a day, and am now impatient for Season Two to be released.

Of course, this meant we needed to see some episodes so we were familiar with the characters and the plot of the show.  Needless to say, we were instantly hooked.  Six Feet Under is one of those shows that doesn't try to talk over your head or make you feel stupid for watching it.  You have real characters in real situations and you follow how they handle the situations sometimes in very humerous situations.  Granted death isn't funny, but the other things going on in the lives of the Fishers can be.  Also, the Fishers have the uncanny ability to talk to the dead.  (You'll have to see that for yourself).

And really, in this first season there's nothing that wasn't in American Beauty either - except there it was far more concise and fresh (and even there, the 'message' of the film was the weakest part of the enterprise once you stop and think about it).
There are extras on the disc, but they are pretty disappointing. No making of-featurette, just interviews with the actors about their characters. Two commentaries by Alan Ball which say almost nothing about how the series was conceived and developed, but rather just dwelling on how great every single actor is and where every scene was shot. And a short featurette about the credit sequence - not a very interesting choice.
So there you have it - a dissenting voice in the wilderness. Oh yes, the packaging is lovely, but very flimsy. The chance of the box breaking apart is quite real if the set is handled a lot!",1051747200,10,1188,4.582159624413146

The script is amazing, the acting is stellar, and the themes are universal.

I was immediately capitvated by this well written, engaging HBO series. Although the first season was flawed, on the whole, Ball manages to capture the absurd elements in life that pop out of the ground every day.
The cast and direction helps carry the weaker episodes but, what's most surprising, is the consistency of the writing. Ball manages to capture our obsession with our vanity and the ""death culture"" that surrounds us.

Show revolves around Fisher family who owns and run funeral home. Each episode begins with death and body ends up at the Fisher funeral home. With the death on a background, show peels away the layers from each character revealing more and more of this dysfunctional family.
Ruth, the mother, works at the flower shop and has the relationship with the owner-Nicolai. She is also my favorite character of the show. Her two sons: David, who is a gay man desperately trying to hide it from everyone including himself, and Nate, black sheep of the family with health problems, who is in an intense and often bumpy relationship with Brenda (who also comes with her own baggage). There is also Ruth's daughter who is convinced that she has the worst life imaginable.
Well, there is no way I can fully describe the brilliance of this show. It is not just about death. If it were it would have been extremely depressing, which it's not. The show is actually very funny. Once you start watching it there is no way you will stop, that's how engaging it is.

While the show was written and produced in a professional manner, the content was such that I found it repellent. I absolutely hated the characters. They ranged from arrogant --but hip-- to foolish-- but hip. Always foul-mouthed, ... . The head of the funeral home, David, I believe is name was, is a homosexual. Fine, but this aspect of his character is paraded throughout the series accompanied by explicit scenes in gay bars and in the bedroom. Something I really do not wish to see. I suppose this is viewed as hip. It is possibly even a taboo to dare mention this. But it may save some other unsuspecting soul, who in the confines of his private chamber, is perhaps not so hip.
There is no character who is admirable. No one is honest. No one posseses a shred of dignity. The schtik of using a funeral home as a setting is novel and even interesting at times. I learned quite a bit about embalming and post-mortem facial reconstruction. But the characters, in being so hip, are somewhat odious.

The #1 standout feature is the first rate writing throughout.  The series follows the lives of a family after the father, the family undertaker, is killed in an auto crash just a few minutes into the first episode.  One of his sons had joined him in the funeral business but the other had been living in Seattle.  Now both sons take over the business with the widowed mother and underage sister living in the house-funeral home along with them.

Each character is fresh and different with Michael Hall playing the most complex character, David, the uptight ""type A"" brother who also is gay.

1795379,5,B00006NT1R,"Yesterday we finished watching ""Six Feet Under - The Complete First Season"" on DVD and tonight we watched the premier episode of the Third Season.  Wow, there sure must have been a lot that went down during the Second Season.  But having gone through those first thirteen episodes we could not stand the idea of waiting until that Second Season came out on DVD to see a new episode so we took the plunge tonight and will just have to fill in the gaps as we go along.
We did this for a fairly simple reason.  ""Six Feet Under"" is the best television ""new"" television show we have seen in a long time.  When everybody got all bent out of shape over ""The Sopranos"" we checked out the first season on DVD and while I thought it was good, I did not think it was the greatest thing on television (I watch ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""; I know all about good television).  But if ""The Sopranos"" failed to live up to its reputation ""Six Feet Under"" exceeded expectations.  Yes, this constitutes evidence that I have a sick sense of humor that leans towards black comedy and a sense of the abusrd, but that is not news to me or anybody who knows me.  The series is about the Fisher & Sons Funeral Home, which is to say that in each episode we essentially open with the death of a person, who will then be entrusted into their care, and whose death will somehow resonate with the Fisher family and their significant others.
The initial credit goes to series creator Alan Ball, who shows that the characters and ironic world he created in ""American Beauty"" were only scratching the surface of his vivid imagination.  Ball does commentary on the first and final episode of the DVD, so make a point of watching those a second time while he chats about what is going on.  But what will make the biggest impression on you is going to be the characters and their performances.  Every episode is it always interesting to see what brilliant bit of acting Frances Conroy is going to turn in as Ruth Fisher.  Beyond that we have the innate capacity of Nate Fisher (Peter Krause) to provide compassion, the enormous pathos we feel for the daily trauma of the life of his brother David (Michael C. Hall), the effervescent being of their sister Claire (Lauren Ambrose), the artistic temperament of master restorative artist Federico Diaz (Freddy Rodriguez), the impish of Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths), the rock that is Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick), and the unhinged lunacy of her brother Billy (Jeremy Sisto).  Oh, and we should not forget kindred spirits such as the recurring one played by Richard Jenkins.
""Six Feet Under"" causes all sorts of wonderful ripples in your choice of viewing opportunities as well.  Having suddenly discovered that Thomas Newman wrote not only the theme music for this series but also ""Boston Public,"" I paid attention to the superb Oscar nominated score he did for ""Road to Perdition"" and am now looking for some more of his soundtracks to check out.  Before this series Peter Krause was on ""Sportsnight,"" so that is the next television show I want to check out on DVD.  Of course, anything Lauren Ambrose does is going to catch my attention as well.  However, I have never, believe it or not, ever been to a funeral and nothing in this series has convinced me I am ever going to be able to.
If you are interested in quality television then check out ""Six Feet Under.""  Do so before it is too late.  After all, you never know what could happen to you when you were out for a drive or while reading a book sitting in your back yard overlooking a golf course...",1046563200,21,3577,4.553822152886116

Somehow, it's achieved the unimaginable -- making morticians actually seem hip.

Flesh tones are flawless, whether from the living or dead. Images are full screen. Audio comes in a fairly sedate Dolby Digital 5.1 that's able to deliver the clarion call of the theme music. The set's packaging is first-class -- sexy, vaguely creepy and reflective of the series' high standards for art direction. Likewise, the active on-screen menus look great. Creator Alan Ball provides commentary on the pilot and the season's closing episode, both of which he directed. The talks tend to focus on the specific episode instead of the series, but he delivers a lot of inside information and back-story material. Ball fades in and out when distracted by the episode (""I had to stop and watch""), leading to some awkward silences. Cast members don't have much to say on a rote ""behind the scenes"" HBO featurette that runs 20 minutes.

Six Feet Under is a series about the lives of the family members of a small family owned funeral home - Fischer and Sons.  The neer-do-well prodigal son, the secretly gay younger son, the lonely, lost teenaged daughter, the sad, unhappy wife, and the deceased patriarch, whom it turns out no one really knew much about.
The show begins each episode interestingly enough - someone dies in some odd way and ends up at the funeral home.  The person's death in some way becomes associated with the overall story in a convoluted morality tale for the family.
The acting is just fine and the scripts are good as well.  I just don't get the point of the show.  CSI is a show about crime scene investigation that gives us the gory details of crimes and the science in solving them.  Crossing Jordan is a night-time soap slipped in under the premise of a crime investigation show.  Six Feet Under is a night-time soap that is set in a funeral parlor - nothing more.
Dynasty, Dallas, and Falcon Crest were larger than life night-time soaps that reveled in their extravagance.  Six Feet Under is really quite pedestrian.  It's nothing terriby interesting - it just has an interesting setting.  It's an American funeral parlor version of Eastenders, without the fun.

It's certainly a strange television show, the kind of thing that could never turn up unadulterated on network television.  There is a focus on death.  There is a constant sense of loss.  There is more drug use by characters than I as a father appreciate seeing.

However, the price for the 1st Season's 13 episodes on DVD is entirely out of line with any other series. I am seriously considering putting my pre-order purchase of this DVD on ice until the price is lowered by a couple of feet.
Fortunately I taped seasons 1 + 2 and can afford to wait, although I'd rather have a quality DVD with background material on the show.

I watched this several years ago,  before the last season was available.

I was home from work recovering from surgery and 2 of the guys I worked with were hooked on it. One loved it so much he bought the CD'S and gave them to me to watch while I was convalescing..

I was a little reluctant because it's based on a family that lives in the upper floors of a large Victorian mansion in Northern California, and operate their funeral home business on the lower floors.

Funerals, and funeral homes kind of scare me, and I wasn't
sure I would last. But the brief references to the actual work and scenes in the embalming room usually have another purpose, and it was fine.

But I have to say, the rather Gothic, sometimes fairy tale nature, and the fact I had the CD's to binge watch, did make me feel like I was immersed in ""6 Feet Under"" world, and it wasn't a show I could casually watch once a week.

Even though this was on HBO several years ago, it is so well written, it more than stands the test of time. NO question, renting the series is completely worth it.

In my opinion, it is one of the most original, dark comedy/dramas ever written, and perfectly cast with Peter Krause, the oldest brother, Richard C. Hall, the younger brother, Lauren Ambrose, the little sister who drives a lime green herse, the fantastic Frances Conroy as their eccentric mother, and Richard Jensen as the father. Perfection.

Each episode begins with the death of a client, and is a sub-plot that intersects with the main plot, but usually briefly to allow an insight, but the show focuses on the living and their humanness, except for the wonderful Richard Jensen, who plays the father, and himself in another form.

When my friend asked me how I liked it, I told him I loved it, and especially loved the opening credits. He told me he loved them, too!

When I was putting away the first CD, I noticed on the label  the first cut was ""Opening Credits."" Apparently, many other viewers loved the credits, also.

The music is phenominal. And you sense not one second, one note, one image is wasted, and everything from the time the  oboe, and all the imagery begins, is used to convey the expertly blended essence of the series; love, separation, heartbreak, humor, whimsey, darkness, (but not evil), and renewal.

I didn't love it. I'm IN love!

Fabulous!",1525478400,,2404,4.5429234338747095
7972490,5,B00006NT1R,"I am a Six Feet Under fan, and bought this set as a replace-
ment for Season One which I lost.

SIX FEET UNDER is one of the best HBO/TV series I have
ever seen.",1523232000,,161,3.6
7972491,1,B00006NT1R,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The discs play fine.

The only thing I liked in this show were the crazy ads that played between scenes. Some of them were funny. I didn't like most of the characters in this show. There was too much crying, too much drug use, guys kissing guys, and then a graphic sex scene of two naked men having sex. That scene ended the show for me. I only watched one episode of The Borgias and stopped watching when they did the same thing, showed two naked men having sex. That's not what I call good entertainment. I don't enjoy watching two women kissing each other either. I close my eyes during the homosexual scenes in shows like Game of Thrones, etc. But most shows have the common sense not to go overboard with the homosexual stuff. Like The Borgias, Six Feet Under went too far over the line for me. I filed the discs with Californication, in the trash.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2345,5.245333333333333
7972492,5,B00006NT1R,"Seasons 1-2 get a full 5 stars. They're sad, funny, and clever.
Season 3 gets a -5 stars, the ""Lisa Season."" The ""Joe Lies, Joe Lies, When He Cries"" actress from Say Anything. REALLY, no one cares about this character.
Seasons 4-5 gets 2.5 stars. Too depressing. No humor. You end up disliking main characters.
Series just plummets after the 2nd season and continues its death spiral, no pun intended.

For a series that began with so much promise, it ultimately ends up not being worth the time to finally...FINALLY...get to the conclusion. And we waited 50+ episodes for the LAZIEST ending ever?! Did they run out of money or did the producers intentionally choose to copy Al Pacino's death in Godfather 3 multiple times? Each character gets a 10 second send off that creates all kinds of questions.

Ole timeless George, twenty years in the future and he hadn't aged a day...do we assume his mental illness was just a temporary condition? Are the producers that big a proponent of electric shock treatment? Really unlikely that Ruth would have still been with George. Baffling.

Do we assume that Keith and David couldn't make it work after all? Keith owns an armored car (his name's on it) and is making a delivery to the First Back of India. Did he move there? David would be 60 when this happens so do we assume he closed the business and moved out of the country leaving their two adopted sons behind? So the big love story is just a bust after all? 14 years later David keels over just before seeing Keith again? Huh?

Our group applauds the comic genius around Brenda's death...Billy finally bores her to death...literally...hahah...Billy really was that boring though. Everyone watching this episode was literally on the floor laughing at Brenda's death and we watched her final eye roll at least ten times...was it supposed to be THAT funny?

By the time Clare dies I guess the family's forgotten all about her? No one there to welcome her into the next realm? Really? What a blown opportunity to show that the family, all young, healthy, and happy, were right there awaiting her arrival. But no, she dies completely terrified and alone...or was she just severely constipated? Our group was mixed on this. Love the pic on the wall of the old David and the young Keith...uh...that makes no sense whatsoever.

What about Miya? Guess she lived forever?

If you have NOTHING else to do, watch the first 2 seasons, enjoy them while they were good, and then move onto something else. Season 3 was a total throw away (NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE LISA CHARACTER) and 4-5 are just slow and depressing. And the abrupt unoriginal lazy ending is an insult, both to the characters and the viewer.",1519084800,,2689,4.708510638297873
