8358555,5,B0029Y60NG,"When my daughter was a little girl, she loved this movie. Now that she has little ones, I've introduced them to both ""Little David"" and ""Top Ten"".  They love them both!! Some might be upset that the acting and the songs aren't that good. But the message of the Gospel, the message of the truths in God's Word, are here. And the children LOVE it!! It was made for children, and I'm so glad I was able to find it's still available!!",1458259200,,430,4.2439024390243905
8358556,1,B0029Y60NG,I got this movie because I love Kingdom Chums ORGINAL Top 10. This movie movie is nothing like it. The animation is terrible and the songs arn't nearly as good. There is live acting in it too and not very good.,1420588800,,210,4.146341463414634
