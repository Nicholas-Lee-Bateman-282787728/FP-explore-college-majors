If ""Doin' Time"" had been available on DVD that's the format in which I would have preferred to buy it but it was only available on VHS and I'm glad to have found it.",1513555200,,343,3.914285714285714

7808332,5,6300271633,"This movie is a laugh riot, Richard Mulligan is as silly as ever as Mongo.  John Vernon is also funny as the career criminal who wants to stay in jail.  Crazy antics, and crazy humor.  Where is the DVD?",1294963200,2,202,4.128205128205129
