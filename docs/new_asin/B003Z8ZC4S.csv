5903589,5,B003Z8ZC4S,"Blues is a tight, low-budget, one-room crime drama that manages to deliver quite a punch in spite of the inherent limitations.

The setup is this.  After wannabe toughs Head and Chile botch an impromptu robbery, beat cop Martin chases them into a blues nightclub, where they hole up with the club's staff... and the now incapacitated Martin.  Thinking that's there's no way out, Chile (rhymes with smile, not silly) follows Head's lead in dreaming up all kinds of no-win hostage scenarios as the building is cordoned off by police backup.

It's a simple and deadly story, and one we've seen often before both in theaters and on TV, but writer/director Brandon Sonnier keeps things remarkably fresh by fleshing out his cast of hostages with compelling backstories.  Whether we're finding out more about clubowner Pop Boudreaux, his floor manager and granddaughter Dee, the new (ex-con) bartender Reese, hip-hop entertainer Lil' Pokey, or the others, we don't at all mind that the running time is being padded a bit--particularly when the third act comes, and the film's unpredictability gets downright surprising.

Ty Hodges was a good choice to play Chile, the reluctantly criminal man-boy who's faced with devastating options for setting things as right as they can be.  Hodges conveys both the Everyman's daily complicity with evil, which is accomplished more by standing by and going along than by pulling a trigger, while also exhibiting what most of us come to think of as our conscience--but which is most often just common sense.  Chile has good reason to have divided loyalties, and also good reason to go straight.

While Steve Connell is also good as the manic Head, a little of such over-the-top characters goes a long way.  In a bigger-budget film, you'd want a Mel Gibson in this role; in a lower-budget film from a few years ago, you'd want Ben Foster.  Head has to be a little Mad Max, and a little bit Jake Mazursky (from Alpha Dog)--which means, in each case, he's got to have some depth.  But Head is written more like Bunny from Platoon, and a film full of Kevin Dillon has never been particularly welcome.

But that's not a problem with Connell--it's more a problem of scripting, and Sonnier fares much better with the direction than with the writing, which is still pretty solid.  One of the script's strengths is the way that it plays with timelines and character introductions.  In more than one case, what you thought you saw to start with ends up being something quite different, and to say much more about it than that would spoil the movie for those coming fresh to it... and that's the best way to come to it.  Suffice to say that Sonnier has a knack for efficient sleight-of-hand storytelling.  I wish most big-budget films were as economical with words, and as creative with staging.

Sonnier also does a nice job of layering meanings of his central metaphor by weaving police work with the music scene--and it all feels organic to the story.

About the only downsides to this tale are, first, that those very staging choices for which I praise Sonnier also lead to an overabundance of close-in camera work and not enough establishing shots; and second, that the closing moments of the film require the audience to accept some pretty radical implausibilities about real-life police work.

But in the end, the film is not about real-world scenarios; it's about the ways in which redemption and atonement are often worked out in a highly unlikely fashion... just as in the greatest story ever told.

If you're up for a claustrophobic, foul-mouthed drama of grit and guilt, you could do much, much, much worse than Blues.",1290470400,4,3648,4.861066235864297

8603935,4,B003Z8ZC4S,"Well made, entertaining story of a hold-up turned hostage situation in a Blues club.  Great performances from entire cast including Ty Hodges (EVEN STEVENS), Ari Graynor (NICK AND NORA'S INFINITE PLAYLIST), and Sydney T. Poitier (DEATH PROOF).  Worth a look!",1393200000,,258,5.425
8603936,3,B003Z8ZC4S,The acting here is engaging enough to hold your interest. The story itself is a little far fetched but not so much as to be laughable. The story telling is a little annoying in that the film makes you watch the same scene multiple times. The film makers could've saved probably 20 mins of our time by just telling the story straight. Its a story about urban thugs and how they hold the workers in a blues bar hostage. The stories told by each actor are interesting and while a little transparent did serve to develop the characters. Some of the diatribes were a little long winded though. If you like drama It's a good movie to watch after you've run through all the A list movies.,1393113600,,681,4.3700787401574805
8603937,4,B003Z8ZC4S,"Good thinking movie with the daughter of Sydney Poitier, (also named Sydney) but with harsher words and more violence than I care for.  (I am a wimp about that kind of stuff--don't even like the violence in James Bond.)  The way the story is put together from different points of view is clever.  I would enjoy other movies with Sydney Poitie--she is a good actress.",1364083200,,366,4.6
