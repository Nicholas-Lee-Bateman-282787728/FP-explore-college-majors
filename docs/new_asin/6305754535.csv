1067508,5,6305754535,"This controversial novel by Gustave Flaubert was beautifully portrayed in this authentic to the period film. All of the actors were riveting. Frances O'Connor was a perfect Emma, and Greg Wise shined as Rodolphe Boulanger. It is a shame though, when a French provincial woman suffers the consequences of debouchery and excess. Beware of the nudity.",1103328000,7,348,5.232142857142857
1067509,4,6305754535,"The second BBC stab at Flaubert's novel in recent memory, successful primarily for the delicately shaded performance of Frances O'Connor (who did similarly elegant work in the recent feature of MANSFIELD PARK).  Handsome enough physical production, good supporting cast, but many unnecessary additions in character and plot points from the screenwriter, and considerably more English than French in feel (the estimable Eileen Atkins, in particular, makes the elder Madame Bovary seem like a refugee from E.F. Benson).  Closer in spirit to the novel than the Chabrol film, with a hopelessly pragmatic Emma in Isabelle Huppert; still eclipsed by the MGM version, where Jennifer Jones' neurotic beauty seems very close to the ideal realization of the book's elusive anti-heroine.  Enjoyable enough, but not on a par with the BBC's finest adaptations.",982281600,26,847,5.5

1067713,4,6305754535,"Like Jane Eyre, it appears there are enough adaptations of Madame Bovary to keep you busy for weeks watching each one with a bag of popcorn and a glass of French wine. Another new version is on the horizon, which will soon be released theatres.

Curious about the story (gasp, yes I hadn't read the book or watched another version until this one), I watched the BBC series done in 2000 with quite a few great actors that I like.

The cast includes Frances O'Connor as Emma Bovary (aka Mrs. Selfridge); Greg Wise as one of her lovers (aka Willougby in Sense & Sensibility 1995 movie); Hugh Dancy as another lover (who played in Daniel Deronda); and Hugh Bonneville, who plays her husband (well, you know what Earl he is).  Fantastic lineup and great acting move this melodramatic story along.

If you haven't read the book or watched an adaptation before, this one will no doubt be as memorable as Anna Karenina by Tolstoy. Madame Bovary was written by a French author by the name of Gustave Flaubert in 1856.  Emma is the central focus of the story, who is a young lady who is in love with love and hungry to experience the world of passion.

She marries a kind and fairly good-looking doctor, who gives her a comfortable life. He is a widower and emotionally mature but soon discovers, after his marriage, that Emma has her head in the clouds when it comes to love, life, and reality.  Unable to satisfy her constant yearning to experience something more, she quickly succumbs to the seduction of two men who fall madly in love with her.  Illicit affairs begin, but it's obvious that Emma has a screw loose somewhere.  As she begins to smother each of her lovers demanding constant attention, they eventually leave.  (Clue - don't smother men. They tend to run.)

Not only does she crave passionate sexual relations, she also craves things.  She's the type of woman that in this day and age you definitely don't want her to have a credit card.  Even in Madame Bovary's day, purchasing on credit was as easy as signing one's name. Of course, just like our due dates and bills of the 21st century, there's a time to pay up.  After losing her second lover and the creditors calling in her debits, things turn bleak, having bankrupted her husband.  Arsenic is the answer to her problems, and a young, vibrant woman comes to a tragic end.  Frankly, she would have been better off doing herself in like Anna Karenina - at least it would have been quick and less painful (well, maybe not less painful).

Both Tolstoy and Flaubert's stories are hailed as literary greats. I do find it interesting, though, that each touches on the sad outcome of women who dare to find solace outside the realm of passionless and boring marriages. It was perfectly acceptable in that time period for men to have mistresses. You never read a tale from a 19th century author of any brokenhearted male throwing himself in front of a train or downing arsenic over a lost love - at east I haven't read any.  Enlighten me if you have found such drama between the pages of a book.

Nevertheless, in these stories we are given tragic endings to apparently remind the female gender that if they sought such romantic trysts, only tragedy awaited them as punishment for their sins.  Of course, had her husband done his duty (which most men didn't do either in those days except copulate to have heirs), perhaps Emma would have stayed in the bed she belonged and received the love and passion she longed from her spouse. Okay, I'll stop ranting about the discriminatory attitudes of morality in the 19th century (even before and after that century).

With the new version about to be released, I can honestly say that I found this BBC series a satisfying and well-done portrait of poor Madame Bovary.",1430092800,,3764,4.621621621621622

1067715,3,6305754535,"If you're reading Madame Bovary, either in French or in English, and would like a movie to help sort you out, I would definitely avoid this one.  It doesn't follow the book very closely (scenes are out of order, something done in the book by one character is done in the film by another, major plot points are missing, etc.).

The actress does a terrific job, though.",1405641600,,367,4.462686567164179
1067716,5,6305754535,"MaDame Bovary, when I first saw this film at the beginning I was somewhat unsure if I was going to last to the very end. But fortunately I did. A girl with dreams of what she thinks a marriage and life is gets very disappointed once she has entered into it. A country doctor that is laid back, satisfied with the life he has and want's to concentrate only on his profession, and is not into the world of aristocrat friends, parties, balls, dressing up for the evening opera's. This was a very touching film for me, to find out that people make the wrong choice's when it comes to reality of life and that life has been placed in such a bondage that they are suffocating themselves because they see of no way out. She does everything she could to get her husband to live, romance, and explore what the world has to offer.  It was another one of my great choices of films. The characters played there parts to the top. What is really sad that this film exposes to viewing audiences is that people in real life here and now are going through this very act, and who knows there has probably been and are many MaDame Bovary's out there where they no longer could or can not live in a life of bondage any more that they too took their lives in order to have peace.",1384732800,3,1258,4.241666666666666
1067717,5,6305754535,"I've just watched this again for the first time since it was broadcast in 2000. But this time I watched it on a 7ft projection screen and it works even better in that 'medium' than it does on a large flat screen television, even when the video source isn't HD (though of course, in the absence of true HD, the DVD up-scaling and projector do need to be of high quality).
I've often felt in the past that real TV works best when seen on a real TV - for example the sort of dramas that are defined as soap opera, like Eastenders or Coronation St, or any other dramas shot in the same sort of way. But it is obvious from this 2000 production that high quality adaptations like this were already being conceived visually as cinema.
Still, that is a minor point compared to the quality of this production judged by the usual standards of TV drama or great 19thc novels made into TV serials which we're so used to. Because it seems to me that I've never seen anything better than this, with one possible exception, which is the last BBC adaptation of The Mayor of Casterbidge which I haven't seen since it was broadcast, just as I hadn't seen Bovary again, until now that is.

I've owned 'Casterbridge' on DVD for some years without summoning up the necessary will to go through that painful tragedy again but after seeing Bovary I now have the extra incentive of finding out which of them if any can be considered superior. I suspect however that it will be impossible to make a decision.
I will concede though that in the case of Bovary it isn't reasonable to claim that it is 'better' than the book whereas when I saw Casterbridge I actually felt able to say that it was - for the reasons I gave in my later Amazon review written I think from memory some time afterwards.
Madame Bovary is famous for being one of the most perfect novels ever written, not least because of its style, and I wouldn't disagree. It is obviously impossible for the TV adaptation to be better but at least I feel that it has done it full justice in every way possible for the time allowed. But you could still argue perhaps that like Casterbridge in the final scenes it can have a more powerful effect on the viewer than on reader.
I notice that some of the comments by others claim that this is a too sympathetic interpretation of Emma Bovary. I really don't see how they can have got that impression at all. While watching this a friend of mine exclaimed at one point 'it's enough to put you off women!' Well personally I wouldn't go that far but you get the point. Are they confusing this version with one of the others perhaps? It wouldn't be the first time I have come across this sort of thing on Amazon.",1383782400,,2684,4.368
1067718,5,6305754535,"than the highly acclaimed Jennifer Jones version.  Of course, the censorship of the 50's wouldn't allow nudity or the raw sensuality portrayed here more explicitly.
Still, again as in Vincente Minnelli's/Jennifer Jones' version, the first wife doesn't make an appearance; pity, because even though she lasts only a few pages in the book, I always wanted to see her played on film.  Fortunately, Charles Bovary's mother rolls both characters into one - the mother, and the already-deceased first wife before Emma comes along.
I read other reviews which said this wasn't up to the usual BBC production values, but I did not find it lacking.  And Frances Oconnor is an amazing actress, who portrays the sheer boredom and sense of despair that is so much of the character.  Hugh Bonneville is hopelessly in love with his wife, blind to things he would never want to see.  One slight objection is the very ending; in the book, after burying his wife,  Charles finds the letter that Rodolphe had sent Emma which had broken her heart and her mind, and he himself despairs and comes to ruin, as does their little girl, Berthe, giving the whole book a sense of complete tragedy.
Amazing film; I began watching it for a second time immediately, so I could savor the performances once again.",1370736000,8,1280,4.821917808219178
1067719,3,6305754535,"I was very dissapointed. They really made this a cheap and boring version. Anybody who likes dramas like this should watch the 1949 black and white version directed by Vincente Minnellie....and then imagine it in color....

1067772,5,6305754535,"There's a challenge in portraying the characters of MADAME BOVARY for the filmmakers: how do you make such a reckless, passionate, adulterous ""hot mess"" of a woman like Emma Bovary ""accessible"" to the viewing public?  Does the good but bland doctor deserve to have his life ruined by her?  Do any of her lovers deserve to sail off into a happy romantic ending where she can find that elusive passion?

Not if you're going to be true to this story.  And that's part of the reason why Flaubert's story has endured as one of the greatest novels of all time.  People are flawed and complex, desires can be unreasonable and destructive, consequences can be extreme and pitiless.  That Flaubert used his skills as an artist to avoid distracting us with any romantic fantasies is why his work is still read, studied and adapted in film.

Frances O'Connor does an incredible job in bringing Emma Bovary to life.  The rest of the cast is wonderful as well but all eyes are on O'Connor.

The writing is first rate and the direction is detailed and well-paced.

This is definitely my favorite adaption of one of my favorite novels.",1348704000,3,1120,4.668367346938775

Then there's this 2000 adaptation starring Frances O'Connor as the ambitious, passionate Emma Bovary. Emma has humble beginnings, starting out as an indulged farmer's daughter who gets a quality education (in comparison to other girls of her station) at an Ursuline convent. She catches the eye of the local village doctor, Charles Bovary (Hugh Bonneville of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Classic-Downton-Abbey-Original-UK-Edition/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey (Original UK Edition)</a>, some may also remember him as the villain in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Deronda/dp/B000M2E32M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Deronda</a>) and after a brief courtship, the pair get married.

Emma has romantic notions of what life should be like and has the airs and graces of someone above her station. Soon after their marriage, Emma begins to chafe at the provincial and dull life of a village doctor's wife. Though her husband absolutely dotes on her, he can't seem to satisfy her need for romantic passion or fulfill her ever increasing material desires. As Emma nears an emotional breakdown, it is decided that a change of scene might be best for the fragile Madame Bovary's constitution. The couple settle in a larger town where Emma meets a young law clerk Leon (a very young Hugh Dancy) and the pair form a close bond, appearing to be true kindred spirits. Leon shares Emma's passion for the arts, something Charles could never relate to. However this passion for each other remains platonic because of Emma's ambivalent nature, and Leon soon departs for the big city. Eventually Emma bears Charles a daughter. Even motherhood proves too overwhelming for Emma, and she performs her duties in a perfunctory manner, hardly ever taking notice of her beautiful little girl. Only her formidable mother-in-law, Marie Louise (a credible portrayal by Eileen Atkins who can be seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Episode-1-Cranford-HD/dp/B004GTKP9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Episode 1 - Cranford [HD</a>]) sees Emma for what she truly is - a spoiled, petulant, selfish woman concerned only with her own needs and desires.

When a rich nobleman Rodolphe catches sight of Emma, the rake is bent on seducing her, and succeeds beyond his wildest expectations. In Rodolphe, Emma is able to unleash all her pent-up passions and the pair engage in a long-term, torrid affair. How Charles, the cuckolded husband is ignorant of his wife's shenanigans is beyond my understanding when everyone else in town seems to suspect what is going on! The story continues until Emma's inevitable and tragic downfall, though I must say I wasn't the least bit sorry to see it happen.

Emma Bovary is one of the most unsympathetic characters I've come across on screen or in literature (at least in Anna Karenina, I felt much empathy for Anna). At certain points during the drama, Emma's inner monologue says, ""This is not my choice."" Yet, she doesn't try to find a way out of her dull, listless marriage or rejuvenate it as a sensible woman would. After all, unlike the female protagonist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tenant-of-Wildfell-Hall/dp/B00005JOA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</a>, Emma is not in an abusive relationship. Her husband loves her and cherishes her, and yet all she does is hurt him and bring about his ruin. How is one to sympathize with a woman like this, so bereft of love, care, and sensitivity? The callous manner in which she treats her own father, her husband and her daughter makes her a repulsive character to me. Frances O'Connor deserves credit for giving a compelling portrayal of Emma Bovary, with finely nuanced acting that eclipses her fine turn in the much maligned 1999 adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park/dp/B00742GBDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park</a>&nbsp;(which though far removed from Austen's novel, is worth a watch for O'Connor's performance as Fanny Price).

In addition to the film, there's also a special feature documentary titled ""A Complex Heart: Gustave Flaubert"" which takes a look at the influences on the author and his works. The film runs 158 minutes approx. with the option of English subtitles. I'd recommend this to all fans of well-made period dramas.",1347062400,5,5167,6.093406593406593
