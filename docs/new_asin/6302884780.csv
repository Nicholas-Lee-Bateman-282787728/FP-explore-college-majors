524588,4,6302884780,"MARIA MONTEZ, JON HALL and SABU made some very entertaining Technicolor ""sand and sandals"" epics at Universal and this DVD restoration showcases them in brilliant Technicolor.

It's strictly Saturday afternoon matinee stuff, nothing to really ponder in the way of complex plots--just the usual good vs. evil with Hall coming to the rescue of beautiful princess Montez in her usual damsel in distress kind of role.

Exquisitely photographed on desert sands, it's exotic fun fare for adults and children with lots of eye candy to keep things interesting. TURHAN BEY is effective in a brief role but it's Montez and Hall who keep the story moving along at a lively pace. Well worth viewing and nostalgic fun for fans of the Universal series starring this trio of stars.",1173398400,4,766,4.9765625
524589,4,6302884780,"Universal's first 3-strip Technicolor feature is stunning to behold with Knab, Utah standing in for the Arabian desert. Technicolor is the highlight of this fun film. Inspired by the success of Alexander Korda's THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1940), this was the start of a very popular series of fantasy adventure films from Universal with the beautiful Maria Montez and Jon Hall. The film is a lot of fun, but it pales when compared to THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, which not only had Technicolor, but one of the greatest musical scores (Miklos Rosza) ever created for a film as well incredible sets and art direction. The earlier film is the true classic of fantasy films, but the ARABIAN NIGHTS is a lot of fun in its own way -- just not a classic.",1172707200,,733,4.5606060606060606
524590,5,6302884780,"Maria Montez finally on DVD -- and better late than never!  The Queen of Universal Technicolor in the 40's, this beauty starred in a slew of films that showcased her good looks in scanty harem wear more than her acting ability.  A late show staple for years (and inspiration for generations of gay men), Montez is unknown to many current film fans.  But it's hard to imagine anyone, from the kids to Grandpa, not getting a kick from her movies, and ARABIAN NIGHTS is a fine place to start investigating.  Full of breathless action, corny comedy, epic romance, and eyepopping color, it's ideal Saturday afternoon fare.

524591,3,6302884780,"After her adoring audience had grown up, they discovered that Maria Africa Vidal de Santo Silas (born 1920, died 1951) hadn't done her own singing (she was dubbed), nor her own dancing; her ability as an actress was also put into question, but her spell was not tarnished...

Maria Montez was still the madly glamorous South American 'Queen of Technicolor'. What her roles (all of them variations of Scheherazade) required were ingredients she had a surplus of: statuesque bearing, regal demeanor, fiery beauty and, best of all, an unassailable confidence in herself... When one weighed all the things she couldn't do against the thing she did so well, the balance came out in her favor...

Her film, ""Arabian Nights,"" is a well presented oriental adventure which has nothing to do with its source material but entertained multitudes in search of relief from total war and was followed by several vaguely similar slices of hokum with the same stars...",1166313600,18,951,5.012658227848101
524592,5,6302884780,"At last, Universal is releasing the first Maria Montez & Jon Hall adventure classic in glorious Technicolor. I was surprised to see that this was not part of a Collection of 6 Montez films, but happy to get these 1940s classics any way Universal wants to release them. ARABIAN NIGHTS (1942) is great Saturday-matinee fun, but some of the others are even better: COBRA WOMAN (1944) is by far the best, with Montez playing dual roles. ALI BABA AND THE 40 THIEVES (1944) is also a wonderful action adventure, as are WHITE SAVAGE (1943), SUDAN (1945) & GYPSY WILDCAT (1944). I hope Universal will soon release all of these long-neglected classics. I have been waiting a long time.
If you are looking for exotic, colorful, action adventure in beautiful Technicolor, you are in for a great treat.

The real show on this is the presence of that genius named Maria Montez, an incredibly bad actress, that finds her way in this type of nonsensical ""It is Written"" adventures, that makes the desert of Arizona the ideal faking for Arab-themed stories. She's ideal with cheap jewelry and exaggerated make-up, and dancing with an inneffable style (her dancing shows in these films are astonishing, specially in Cobra woman).",1047513600,17,657,5.149532710280374
524594,4,6302884780,"(Action/Adventure, 1 hr 26 min, Technicolor) Universal - U.S.A.
DIRECTOR:  John Rawlins
CAST:  Edgar Barrier, Leif Erickson, Billy Gilbert, Thomas Gomez, Jon Hall, John Qualen, Sabu, Shemp Howard,  Maria Montez (As: Sherezade)
COMMENTS:  The legal heir to the throne of  the Caliph, played by Jon Hall, is attacked and almost murdered by his evil  brother, played by Leif Erickson, who seizes the throne.
A dancing girl  (Maria Montez) finds the wounded heir and nurses him back to health. They  fall in love, and he sets off on a series of adventures accompanied by a  trusted friend (Sabu), an aging Aladdin in search of his mislaid lamp (John  Qualen), and a bragging, shiftless Sinbad in his declining years (Shemp  Howard).
It's all adolescent adventure but great fun and the production  is lavish in all areas, particularly the costumes, sets, and wonderful,  lush color which the public was impressed with. The film earned Oscar  nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Sound,  and Best Score.
To Maria, it was her first important role, as the  beautiful dancer Scherezade, considering that she had to deal with an  absurd dialogue.  And this was the movie that gave her the nickname of  ""The Queen of Technicolor"".",956620800,43,1250,5.099009900990099
524595,4,6302884780,"From the foolish acts of her father, Sheherazade is cast under a spell by evil caliph. But, true love (Shemp) is artfully working to save her. The forty-thieves come to ride. Sabu (from the Jungle Book) helps until he  finds a curiosity in an old Genie's lamp. This is the first teaming of  Montez, Hall, and Sabu. Thankful the successful trio went on to make more.  If some reviewers find this tale trite, perhaps it is because it lacks the  gore and step-by-step sex of other flicks. This is for the whole family and  to me, a fun tale. Enjoy",937699200,19,544,4.4

Two brothers fight for the throne.  One, sympathetic.  The other, power mad.  Both want the love of Maria's character who on the outside seems to want only power and a rise in status from dancing girl, but in reality is a softie who only has eyes for the former Caliph, who is pretending he's not one.

Fight scenes, complete with fire and guns, camels and horses.

I still can't figure why everyone is wearing large blankets and lots of scarves, etc. in a desert.

Cool background comments on the film from a film commentator -- name escapes me at the moment.

Maria Montez (who owned this kind of part throughout the 40s) and Jon Hall are sublimely wooden and beautiful and Sabu seems to be enjoying himself. The cartoonish acting is superbly matched by the cheesy sets, costumes, matte shots and action sequences.",1387152000,2,383,5.295081967213115

524616,5,6302884780,"Universal's Arabian Nights starring Jon Hall. Maria Montez is the first big Walter Wanger production that brought beautiful color onto the movie screen. Say your a young boy of 12 to 15 going to your local theatre for a saturday matinee afternoon back in 1942 and you see shorts and cartioons and then in a second a beautiful color picture flashes on the screen and you are transformed back to the days of the exotic Arabian Nights and that is very easy then because of all the problems we have in the middle east now,well we don't know that stuff then and now you can relive that era.
It's fun it has comedy,adventure,intrigue and beauty . Who doesn't like to look at Maria Montez who was close to 30 when she made this movie after being on the Universal lot since 1939 waiting for her big break. You can catch Maris as a model in the movie The Invisible Woman 1940. Sabu also is in this movie bring that youthful look as he has graduated from the Alexander Kords big budget movies like The Thief of Bagdad and Drums and The Jungle Book.
And Jon Hall who also started out at Universal in serials but got famous from the movie The Hurricane. Well they are all here in one big on and this is the first of 6 beautiful color movies released by Universal.

Though there are no magical elements in this narrative, if you enjoy the period with its architectural and clothing splendor, then this is the ticket.",1281830400,,351,5.481481481481482
524625,3,6302884780,"Arabian/Oriental adventure was one of the rages in Hollywood of the war years, made all the more attractive by the huge commercial and artistic success of the Alexander Korda production THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in 1940.  A couple of years later, Universal decided to do its own ""Arabian Nights"" adaptation, making it quite apparent by the obvious title, the hiring of BAGDAD costar Sabu for a major role, and the use of Technicolor (a first for the studio) that it was going for the same audience.  The film didn't disappoint at the time, getting several Academy Awards technical nominations and making a decent chunk of change for producer Walter Wanger and the studio.

Sadly, it doesn't really hold up today, and certainly isn't going to be any kind of competition for the British film among the annals of classic adventures.  The problems are manifold; first, a tired storyline that makes the fairly simple plot of the earlier film seem Proustian in comparison, in which good Caliph Haroun Al-Raschid (Jon Hall) gets overthrown by his evil half-brother Kamar (Leif Erickson), flees and falls in love with Kamar's intended Scheherezade (Maria Montez), while being helped back to his rightful place by loyal acrobatic performer Ali Ben Ali (Sabu, of course).  Second, plodding direction by John Rawlins - forgotten today and deservedly so if this is a typical example of his work - which tends to cut away from the action sequences before we can actually get into them, and focus far too much on boring exposition, with uninteresting set-ups throughout that rarely help to take us out of the cheap sets and into fantasy-land.  And third, terribly mediocre acting on the part of nearly everyone apart from Sabu - and a focus on slapstick antics that, again, keep us continually aware that we're watching a movie.  Casting Shemp Howard as Sinbad certainly doesn't help, and a vaudevillian/slapstick sequence at a blacksmith shop towards the end is a serious low point.

But Sabu IS compelling, as always - he belongs in a better film; and the color, particularly in the early sequences, is excellent, even stunning.  Montez gets a lot of flack as an actress in general, and I can't say that I find her as beautiful as her reputation, but her odd accent and seriousness actually work pretty well here, though she's not really given much to do apart from a dance scene at the end which looks like it could have been body-doubled for the most part.  And I suppose that all in all, this probably works as a camp-fest if you can't take it seriously (and how could you?).

Nothing much in the way of extras here on this well-mastered DVD, just a nice little Robert Osborne intro and the original trailer.  All in all, a fun waste of an hour and a half, and worth a look for anyone who, like me, is a bit obsessed with this kind of exotic adventure story.  Just don't expect this to be one of the best examples.",1259971200,3,2899,4.716831683168317
524626,3,6302884780,I hope this DVD will keep my English 12 students involved.  I have not seen it yet.,1258502400,,83,3.8823529411764706
524627,4,6302884780,"I've always been a sucker for, ""Old Hollywood"" movies, with all their grandeur, great costumes, and pomp.  Arabian Nights was a wonderful trip down memory lane to a movie I last saw on Bill Kennedy at the Movies, many, many years ago.

This is a 1942 gloriously technicolor movie that was just what America needed to take it's mind off our boys fighting in WWII.  It starts off in a harem, where an older gentleman is sleeping/ snoring when he is supposed to be teaching the ladies in a harem a story.  When he finally awakens, the story that is unvieled is about a beautiful dancer named, ""Sherazda"" who sends a spurned lover off on what she thinks is an unattainable quest...to become the Caliph.  Little does she know he is the brother of the Caliph and does exactly that.

Sherazada is breath-takingly played by Maria Montez, who can chill or warm a man with one look from her eyes.  The girl has got it goin' on.  She is a member of a traveling circus and it was foretold to her that she would marry into royalty and reign.  Joining her in the circus is a wonderful diverse cast of characters, including, I was excited to see, the man who played, ""Shemp"" in the three stooges, and a gifted young actor named, ""Sabu"".

While doing what we would now call a, ""pyramid"", with Sabu on the very top, Sabu ( Ali ) sees the good Caliph shot with an arrow ( his brother had taken Sherazada's words to heart and started to take over the kingdom ).  Jon Hall plays Haroun-Al-Roschid, the good Caliph, and he and his would be assassin tumble a couple of stories to the ground.  Sabu sees this while performing and comes to Jon's rescue.  Sabu hides the true Caliph's identity, knowing that the Caliph's brother would continue to hunt him down.  Sabu removes the Caliph's ring and places it on his would be assissin's finger ( the assissin's face was smashed beyond recognition during the fall, thus ensuring that the Claiph's brother would think that the Caliph was dead ).

Jon's wound is tended to by Sabu and his fellow circus comrades, the only one knowing his true identity being Sabu ( Ali ).  Though Sherazada wants her foretold future, she is drawn to Jon's honorableness and loyalty and begins to fall in love with him.  He too feels himself falling, even though he knows this woman was what triggered his brother to try and usurp and kill him.

What follows is a great adventure with betrayals, horse chases and laughs.  The acting occasionally is a bit over the top, thus the 4 out of 5 stars, but it was still a really fun, carefree way to spend a few minutes of my day.",1222905600,5,2575,4.452025586353945
