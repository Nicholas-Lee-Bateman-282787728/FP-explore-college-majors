Not only are these jokes not funny...they detract from the material that they are trying to teach in the first place.  There is a lot of empirical evidence that show that students that learn with material loaded with a lot of seemingly related, humorous details...remember only those details and not the details of what they are suppose to learn.",1153267200,,523,4.865168539325842
