2208359,4,B0007CILKW,"This is an older DVD taken some years ago, but Irish humor is timeless. This is a funny 2 DVD set and safe for children to watch.

He is one of the best Irish joke tellers on the planet.",1207612800,7,186,3.769230769230769
2208360,5,B0007CILKW,"My parents visited Ireland in 1995 and saw Hal Roach in Jurey's Inn,
in Dublin.  His show was hysterical. They said they could not stop
laughing.  My Dad made a tape of it.  And it's true.  This guy is
really funny.  Me & my family belly-lalughed for an hour.

There should be more clean, family-orientated comics around. Try Hal
Roach, you might laugh all the way to the bank!!!!!!!!!!!",1194220800,10,387,4.536231884057971
2208361,5,B0007CILKW,"Classic Irish comedy.  Very funny man in a traditional Irish setting.  Not as well known among the younger set, even those from Ireland.",1396483200,,136,4.869565217391305
2208362,5,B0007CILKW,"Hal Roach was the star of Jury's Irish Cabaret in Dublin for over 20 years. His special style of humour has entertained  countless thousands of visitors,and sent them home to the four corners of the globewith a smile in their hearts and fond memories of ""that funny little guy"".Hal is much more than that;his dedication to his art,his commitment to making people laugh,his perfect timing and a true professionalism steeped in the heritage of the humour of Ireland,make his a unique talent.
 ""Write it down"" he says,and whether the story is of a wife,mother in law,politicians,the Irish cop,two fellows Flanagan & O'Reilly in a pub,the local nuns or the Bishop,tales about ""the Drink"", things said upon deaths or at wakes and funerals,or strangers meeting a local along a road;he relies on the fact ""that we Irish talk like that"",he brings the house down with laughs. When such a world famous comedian like Jackie Gleason makes sure he attends one of Hal Roach's Shows at Jury's in Dublin;youknow it has to be the best there is. He not only played at Jury's but throughout the world,and was loved everywhere he went. He was the definition of ""A Class Act"",never having to depend on vulgarity for a laugh,never insulted even the most sensitive soul,;and was at his best telling stories that were about the types of people in his audience,whether they were Irish,women,clergy,ethnics,whoever. His stock and trade was humour,and that's why he deserved the title ""King Of Irish Humor"".
Unfortunately,he passed away on February 28,2012 at the age of 85;  so you can no longer enjoy his shows live;but now are still able to listen to his recordings and enjoy his books. I have a Vinyl LP published in 1990 that has 80 minutes,on 2 records from his Jury's Show. I imagine it is much the same as this DVD.There is an excellent photograph of him on the cover ,impeccably dressed,as always,sporting a white jacket,a green polka dot tie,ared rose in his lapel,a green hankie in his pocket, and the ever present black framed glasses,as you would see him in a show. It is different,no matter,you'll love either one or both. This is humor that everyone would enjor,be they friends in a pub or the Bishop and Mother Superior at an afternoon tea.",1390867200,,2229,4.84514435695538
2208363,1,B0007CILKW,I got it on the recommendation of friends who thought this guy was hysterical. He must have had an off night when they recorded this one.,1376006400,,137,4.3076923076923075
2208364,5,B0007CILKW,"Hal Roach dvd played on our senior bus trip. we laughed so much I had to order my own copy of the dvd. If you want to enjoy a comedy of clean material, this product is for you",1374796800,,175,3.6315789473684212
2208365,5,B0007CILKW,"I'd totally forgotten about this comic until a friend mentioned him.  He is hilarious.  Remembering his catch phrase ""write it down"" I started thinking of today's comics and where they got the idea for using one (Git-R-Done, you might be a redneck).  Bet it was Hal.",1361491200,3,266,4.739130434782608

2208367,5,B0007CILKW,"Hal Roach was the headliner at Jury's Hotel in Dublin for over 30 years.  His humor was very funny and in all his years, I don't think he ever used a profane word.  The greatest!",1343001600,4,178,4.057142857142857

I shall wait a further week then contact the supplier.",1288569600,,216,4.8108108108108105
2208369,5,B0007CILKW,"We popped his tape into our car while traveling the highways and byways of Ireland. We had the double treat of beautiful Irish vistas while we laughed at Hal Roach's stories and jokes. He is a national treasure even though we found more Irish Americans seem to know him than the Irish people. Very witty, and very family friendly. Now write it down - and order today.",1244332800,2,367,4.492537313432836
2208370,5,B0007CILKW,These funny short stories / jokes can be told anywhere. I like to recall these stories at family gatherings at a time when a ice breaker is needed. People ask me where I find these stories and I like to send them a new DVD of their own for a celebration or holiday. Thanks Hal for helping people come together and laugh in the Irish Tradition.,1228262400,6,343,4.212121212121212

8046753,3,B0007CILKW,"Excellent clean humor the entire family can watch. Mr. Roach is a gifted humorist and presenter. I highly recommend this DVD. There are two DVD disks, one recorded in 1988 and the other 1990. There are repeated jokes from the first disk also on the second. There is ""filler"" on both disks: on disk 1 there is a video montage of Ireland, on the second a gentle man sings a couple of songs. While these are quality ""fillers"" I am paying for Mr. Roach's fine humor not fillers and repeats.  As for the repeated jokes...there is such a  thing as video editing. Both programs are about 56 minutes each and could have gone on one DVD but then they would not be able to charge $20 plus for the 2 DVD set. Considering the age of the videos and the ""fillers"" the price point is way too high;  $13.00 would be a fair price. I doubt the wife and I will buy the other disks available as we fear more of the same described here.  I would give 5 stars for Mr. Roach's outstanding clean humor and 1 star for the value for the money; therefore the average rating of 3.",1455926400,,1052,4.218905472636816
8046754,5,B0007CILKW,"If you've never heard of this guy, you need to give him a listen!  He was the ""unofficial ambassador"" of Ireland for a long time, for very good reason.  The whole family loves him!",1454803200,,180,4.264705882352941

8046757,5,B0007CILKW,"Hal Roach is old school Irish Humor, it is clean fun, his humor and charm brings you into another time and country when he talks about families or traditions you smerk, laugh and become transferred to a wonderful country and time.",1398988800,,230,4.634146341463414
8046758,1,B0007CILKW,"Neither of the 2 pack CD played. I tried it in my home player and in my car. my home player kept registering "" no CD "" and the car player just kept spitting it out.  I've attended  Hal Roach shows several times and was hoping for his humor at our St Patricks Day gathering. Very disappointing",1396569600,,292,4.105263157894737
