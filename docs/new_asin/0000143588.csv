8362027,5,0000143588,"I cannot say enough good things about this DVD set. Not only do you get hours and hours of entertaining, but Ina is so pleasant and loves what she does and that comes through in this DVD set. The recipes are fabulous, my favorites!.. Linguine with Shrimp Scampi, and her Cheddar Corn Chowder. I have never had corn chowder this good, I've already made this chowder 2 times. Serve it with baguette, lightly buttered and toasted in the oven. I've made the Linguine with Shrimp Scampi twice and each bite has you coming back for more especially since it has lemons, and a little lemon juice in the mix.",1413158400,3,599,4.504587155963303
8362028,5,0000143588,Great dvd of one of my favorite cooking shows.  Glad to find this on amazon.com as it seems to be out of print,1411776000,,110,3.782608695652174
8362029,5,0000143588,I wish she would release more DVDs.  These are discontinued and luckily i was able to find one on here after searching all over the place.  I watch her show on Food Network everyday and can't get enough of it!,1411776000,,209,4.2
8362030,5,0000143588,ina garten is amazing i love her show especially the early episodes i wish if there a new dvd :),1359936000,2,96,3.85
8362031,5,0000143588,This book is excellent. I have always liked watching her on tv. Her recipes are very easy to follow and are delicious!,1347494400,4,118,4.409090909090909
8362032,3,0000143588,Barefoot Contessa with Ina Garten is a three disc set with three full meals on each disc. In my opinion a lot of space is wasted on each disc which could have been used so much better .The content of the DVD's is very good and I am a big fan of Ina Garten's approach to preparing food but I am not at all happy with my purchase on a value for money basis. I would have much prefered to purchase one of her cook books.,1334707200,5,417,3.86046511627907
8362033,4,0000143588,"I got this as a gift from a friend who knew I was an Ina fan. This set is basically a three-disc compilation of nine episodes of her Food Network show. They're from earlier in the show, so better than the more recent ""Back to Basics"" thing that she has been doing. There are a lot of recipes included, about 4-5 per episode so you're getting a good 40 or so recipes, all of which look delicious and are deceptively simple.

Buy this if you don't have regular access to Food Network to watch reruns of Barefoot Contessa; otherwise, get a cookbook, which would be an easier reference than a DVD.",1299196800,20,593,4.342342342342342
