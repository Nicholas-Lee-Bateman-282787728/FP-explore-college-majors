8155988,3,B000KF0DRA,"The movie didn't burn up any top ten horror lists, but it can entertain with the right mix of friends and alcohol. I saw it with a bunch of the cast and crew and the debut screening in IL, and it was a hoot. A schlocky hoot, but look at the cover!

One standout: the detective scenes. I thought they were hysterical, with the two detective partners (Brent Douglas and Erik Lindberg) adding a lot of color and relief to what would otherwise just not be a lot of fun.

And Joe Estevez! Sure, why not.",1298419200,,498,4.177083333333333
8155989,2,B000KF0DRA,"Drawing Blood (Michael and Jeffrey Wolinski, 2005)

While this isn't the movie I was expecting to get when I rented this (I was looking for Sergio Lapei's film of the same name), I figured I'd give it a whirl anyway and see what came up. I'm quite fond (perhaps overly so) of no-budget horror flicks, so what did I have to lose? Ninety minutes of my time, I guess.

Drawing Blood is an odd little film about a mentally defective serial killer who escapes from the asylum where he's being held and takes up residence in the basement of George Adams (Brian Irzyk)'s house. George's wife, Catherine (American Reel's Rebecca Shea) is away for the weekend, and he's basically oblivious, so Jimmy the serial killer can pile up bodies in the basement like nobody's business. (You'd think someone would eventually notice the smell...)

Well, I'll be blunt--the main reason to watch Drawing Blood is to get an eyeful. Not of gore, much of which is more suggested than shown, but of nubile young women, most of whom seem all too happy to drop their clothes at a moment's notice. Which is all well and good, of course, but the Wolinski brothers' attempts at erotic filmmaking seem to go horribly awry every time they show up. The one extended sex scene (featuring Justice's Miranda Watts) has shots that simply make no sense. A close-up of someone's ankle? Okay, if your serial killer's hand is going to creep out from under the bed and seize it, but otherwise, really? (And there aren't enough close-ups of this type to satisfy the foot fetishist.) Why?

So, all that aside, and tossing bad acting and pedestrian direction into the pile, what is there positive to say about this movie? The premise is interesting, and the ending (not the cheap O. Henry-ish ending--keep watching through the credits) is cheer-worthy. So if you can put all the other stuff aside and that's enough for you (judging by the ratings on IMDB, that works for enough people to make this a highly-rated movie), then by all means, hunt a copy of it down. Otherwise, keep looking for whatever it was you were trying to find when you picked this one up by accident. * ",1181433600,,2129,4.651595744680851
