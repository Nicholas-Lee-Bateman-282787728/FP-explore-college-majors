5927143,5,B00ELE8C1K,"This is a really good series.  I thought that it would probably one of those ""ethnic"" comedies, but it isn't.  It is great entertainment and the acting and stories are very well done.  Highly recommend.",1398816000,,202,4.714285714285714
5927144,5,B00ELE8C1K,"The struggle to understand an other culture besides their own makes the story seem like it could really happen. The saris
and jewelry worn by the main woman actress were beautiful.",1398124800,,180,4.838709677419355
5927145,5,B00ELE8C1K,It has good story lines.  The acting is great.  The doctor's wife is always elegant in her sari.  Even her visiting mom was great.,1391990400,,130,4.333333333333333
5927146,5,B00ELE8C1K,"The Indian Doctor is very entertaining and the costumes, backgrounds, love and caring in the dialogue is just excellent. I recommend the movie  - 5 starts",1387843200,,154,4.923076923076923
5927147,5,B00ELE8C1K,"Wonderful sequel to Series 1. Interesting characters, brilliant acting, enthralling story lines well written.  Bring on Series 3!  I can't wait!",1386720000,,144,5.809523809523809
5927148,5,B00ELE8C1K,"Well acted, interesting historically, and visually appealing. I particularly  enjoyed the casting choices, and the beautiful scenery.  I'm looking forward to Series Three.",1385596800,,171,6.391304347826087
5927149,5,B00ELE8C1K,"After the excellent first series, this brings more of the same: great acting, good characterisation, excellent production values and a strong story line. The story revolves around an outbreak of smallpox, and whereas this may seem fanciful, there was an outbreak in the UK in the early the sixties. The mix of serious and comedic characters is still there and the doctor and his wife have settled into the community. Due to the subject nature, some scenes are 'harder hitting' than in series one and, (without wanting to publish a spoiler or give the plot away), there is one scene in the later part of episode 4 that, although sensitively done, is so well conceived and brilliantly acted it will, if you have any soul, leave you emotionally drained. The BBC have recently shown series 3 of this gem of a programme, hopefully we will not have to wait quite as long for it to be released on DVD as we have for this series. Highly recommended.",1382832000,8,941,4.640718562874252
8606621,5,B00ELE8C1K,"A great series about life in a Welsh village and the modern challenges. Besides being enjoyable, the cast portrays a delightful and insightful human story of how cultures can find balance and compliment each other...",1453420800,,216,5.2
8606622,2,B00ELE8C1K,"Pretty standard BBC fare.  You've got your enlightened foreigner and your local rubes sounding and acting stupid and racist.  You've got your obnoxious Christianesque minister who is unlike any Christian minister I've ever known in the real world - doesn't even know what a Christian baptism entails - but it's a character they never get tired of using.  You've got your anachronistic plot points all working to reinforce the unrelenting politically correct propaganda we've been being served up for 40 years, at least.  Oh, that someone would break the mold!  It's getting pretty damn boring.",1447804800,,593,5.2
8606623,4,B00ELE8C1K,I really enjoyed this series and wished there were more. It's different and well cast.,1438128000,,86,4.8
8606624,5,B00ELE8C1K,"Another Doc Martin, this time with race/culture causing the issues of Preem and his wife fully being accepted in a small Post-war Welsh village.  Amazing to watch the characters develop and change as they learn more about the Doctor.  Drama, Humor, and Warmth mixed with some comedy.  This time Smallpox hits the village, along with food shortages as the village is quarentined!  A must buy!",1408752000,,391,4.969230769230769

8606627,4,B00ELE8C1K,"Great Characters, interesting scenario, but the plot drags on.  It could have been much better considering the great cast.",1404345600,,122,5.421052631578948
