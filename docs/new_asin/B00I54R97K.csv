8639316,5,B00I54R97K,"... when my wife (born in Denver, CO) first heard the main musical theme, she said ""This is real swing"" ... ( and this was said about a Soviet movie, made in 1945).
The movie-musical is in Russian (of which I only understand a few words) - but it makes no difference.  It is a fun movie, and makes you feel good.  The heroes are Soviet pilots - both men an women, or to be exact girls (which was not a no-no word by the inventors of Political Correctness, the Soviets).  And another hero: the ""Sky Slug"" or ""Heavenly Slug"" - the UT-2 (also known as PO-2) biplane trainer, which was used by Soviet pilots (mostly women) for night bombing, dropping 25-lb bombs.
Technically - at least aviation-technically - the film is crude: in the opening sequence (and in some of the flying scenes) the aircraft perform flat turns that are impossible in real life, and German fighters are represented by old Soviet ones...
On the other hand - almost unheard of for a Soviet movie of that era - there is not a single mention of the ""Great Stalin"" - in fact the only place where his picture shows up in the background of a few shots on the wall of the Air Force general's office.
This musical has essentially two tunes - and one ""ballet"" scene (if you want to call that with a somewhat chunky Soviet Air Force women and man dancing Russian folk dances) - but overall it is still excellent.
Just shows you that a movie is more than the sum of its component parts...",1421280000,,1447,4.351851851851852
