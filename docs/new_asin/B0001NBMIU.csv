2018222,2,B0001NBMIU,"I was so excited that Jenifer Lewis was starring in another film and I anticipated the release immensely, as I am a HUGE Jenifer Lewis fan. I have almost everything she's been in from her days on In Living Color to Jackie's Back to episodes of Girlfriends.  I left work early the day of the release of Nora's Hair Salon just to buy it.  After watching this movie, I was so disappointed to see such a watered down play on her natural personality on screen.  Was I expecting too much?  I just thought this movie was a complete waste of her talent.  She even seemed somewhat repressed during certain scenes in the movie (nothing at ALL like her character Jackie Washington in JACKIE'S BACK, which is in the top 3 of my favortie movies of all time).  Additionally, Tamala Jones has seen much better parts and is so much more of a comedic entertainer than this film allowed her to be.  On the upside, I was very impressed by Tatyana Ali's performance.  Although she was great in THE BROTHERS, she shined even brighter in this film.  Unfortunately, the ONLY reason I bought this DVD is because as I said earlier, I am a HUGE Jenifer Lewis fan and will continue to support anything she's in and I look forward to seeing more of her.",1086048000,5,1225,4.433035714285714

2018224,2,B0001NBMIU,There is some really bad acting in this movie.  Bad story line and the acting is a real turn-off.  Don't waste your money on this one it is a real let down.,1373241600,,156,3.84375
2018225,4,B0001NBMIU,IT'S A GOOD MOVIE.  I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE.  I WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER PART 3.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN,1360540800,,101,3.95
2018226,5,B0001NBMIU,I had seen this movie before and was just adding it to my collection. It's a great movie that would make you laugh and cry and want to watch over and over again.,1347235200,,161,3.909090909090909
2018227,5,B0001NBMIU,"Jennifer Lewis plays Nora, a young woman who runs a hair salon full of sassy, eclectic stylists. The cast is so funny, and I love the characters that were portrayed. My favorite was Ming, the manicurist who wasn't afraid to speak her mind. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants good clean comedic entertainment, along with a very good story about the human spirit, of the common people.",1262736000,,400,4.728571428571429
2018228,5,B0001NBMIU,"Our family thought that the movie was great.  I order this movie on a hunch because of Jennifer, but the story was great and we didn't get bored.  I also like the multicultural actors in the film.  I'm hoping there is a part II.  I read somewhere that they were doing that. The story gave you different backgrounds on how people live from the beauty shop and that it was an honorable profession. Sorry...I loved it.

2018230,4,B0001NBMIU,"All in all, when I really evaluate this movie, it IS a GOOD movie.  No one ever said it was going to be the greatest movie ever, so the other reviewers need to be more appreciative.  Good God, did the previous reviewers expect this to win all the Academy Awards or something?  As other reviewers have pointed out, yes...the movie is low budget and it may contain ""typical"" storylines that could go along with a movie about a hair salon.  However, one must watch this movie over and over again to understand it and appreciate it.  I too was like ""what?""  originally, but I felt the same looking at Napoleaon Dynamite, and that crappy white movie was successful!  As a black person I've realized no black comedy or movie will ever be ""great"" compared to  a white movie that is intelligent or unintelligent, meaningful or unmeaningful.  White movies are always considered successful versus black ones.  Anyways, this ""not the funniest"" movie ends sadly, but touched me...others may not be able to understand, but it's a good movie, with some hilarious parts that fill the voids of disappointment experienced.  The outakes at the end are real funny.  Again, not every movie will be to the standard of another, but personally Nora's Hair Salon is a good movie if you TRY to take the time to appreciate it...and I love it!",1161561600,,1316,4.698689956331878
2018231,1,B0001NBMIU,"...so if that's what you're looking for, you won't get it here.

I found this DVD in the $5 bin at Wal-mart and I'm mad I wasted $5 on it...movie was boring and I understand why it went straight to video.",1153958400,,204,3.975609756097561
2018232,1,B0001NBMIU,"I caught Nora's Hair Salon on Christmas Eve last year on UPN. I started watching the movie at 8:00; it was so terrible I wound up turning off around 8:20. If they tried really hard they could have made a bad movie.

There is a total lack of effort onscreen. No one tried to make this movie work. Not the writers, because the script is about absolutely nothing. All I know is Nora owns a hair salon and people work there. I wanted to who Nora was, and why this hair salon is so important to the community. Why do people want to come here? Why do I want to know about this place? But the screenplay doesn't answer these questions. Instead it takes stock characters and a stock situation used in a dozen other hair comedies and warms them over. Since the writer took no time to tell a story, I wasn't interested in watching the rest of the movie.

The actors don't try to act either. Most are just standing there saying their lines looking bored. I think I saw someone actually look at their watch a couple of times! Cameos by Lil Kim, Bobby Brown and others are a total waste; as they do absolutely nothing except look out of place onscreen. I guess the only thing of interest to them was the paycheck.

Please don't spend your hard earned cash on this DVD It's a total waste of your time If the writers directors, actors and producers of this movie aren't willing to try onscreen why you make an effort to spend 90 minutes of your valuable time watching them do nothing. If you're looking for a good DVD buy Never 2 Big or Diary of a Mad Black Woman instead. At least the actors in those movies try to make an entertaining movie.",1111968000,4,1628,4.279220779220779
2018233,1,B0001NBMIU,"I rented this movie (with a free movie rental coupon) and even having paid nothing I was disappointed.  I really love Jennifer (Nora) and think she is a highly underrated actress.  It's unfortunate that she has to take roles like this that underutilize her talent.

THe storyline is predictable and the characters underdeveloped.  The storyline depends upon too many stereotypical depictions of characters - the ""good"" girl, the ""bad"" girl, the thug, the homosexual male.

I'm a big supporter of Af Am books and films, but I wouldn't recommend spending your hardearned money on this one.",1106611200,15,587,5.072916666666667
2018234,2,B0001NBMIU,What a waste of great talent. All this film needed was a bigger budget. The screenplay was mediocre at best. It was obviously shot on 16mm film. Looks like it was trying to be a Barbershop clone. There were some funny moments thats why I gave it 2 stars.,1103846400,5,254,4.204081632653061
2018235,4,B0001NBMIU,THIS MOVIE WAS O.K. BUT I THINK THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH MORE ACTION!!!!!!,1094342400,,85,4.375
2018236,1,B0001NBMIU,"A big disappointment. The bulk of the movie consists of segueways (not sure if this is the correct name for it) between ""scenes"" of driving around town. This only stretches a movie that needs to be put out of its misery. It would be funny if it weren't so bad. The budget REALLY showed.",1092009600,4,286,4.314814814814815
2018237,4,B0001NBMIU,"Grrl pleazzz this was soo funny Jenifer Lewis is great no matter what she's in... the basic beauty shop with all of the drama...
I think Queen Latifah's Beauty Shop will be similar to this...
This was good even though it wasn't a blockbuster as far as the amount of money it made... The guy who plays half of the gay couple was actually one of the producers he played in another movie with Lisa Ray and Lil Kim I can't remember the name.
Ms. Tamala Jones is always good and right on point... I brought this from (...) and have watched it over and over and over..
Good Buy

2018238,2,B0001NBMIU,"This movie did have some really funny moments in it, and overall, I thought it was funnier then its predecessor, Barbershop.  The acting was pretty solid, to.  However, Barbershop had something from start to finish that this movie completely lacked, a plot.  This story really went nowhere because there was a lack of a goal throughout it.  And after I came to the end of it, I realized why this movie probably didn't get picked up for theatrical distribution, it felt really short!  If the producers would have put as much effort into improving the script as they did with getting name brand people in it (stars) then it probably could have went somewhere.  Oh well.",1088899200,,667,4.706896551724138
2018239,3,B0001NBMIU,"Beauty shops are always so much more than they appear to be.  Your fam is there, they know you and how to heal you.  We all go in there to kick dirt, laugh, and in some instances to cry.  This was a really great story, I think that it could have been a little better it didn't need all of the so called extras (LIL KIM, WHITNEY, or BOBBY BROWN) to help out maybe a stronger story line would have been sufficent.  It however is a nice story.",1088208000,,440,3.965909090909091
2018240,5,B0001NBMIU,"This movie is really good and the ending was so sad. The cast was great except for Lil' Kim. I didn't understand her point in the movie, but whatever.
The story is set around a middle-age women what owns a beauty shop and her employees, which are a constructed as a family and their up and downs, including Nora's that ended so sad.
Later..

8015067,2,B0001NBMIU,"I've always loved Jennifer Lewis, I think she's an underrated versatile character actress, but this was one movie where even her talents couldn't save it. I expected something offbeat and campy, what I saw was another stereotypical and over exaggerated piece of throwaway nonsense.. The acting from Lewis wasn't the problem, it was the badly written script and most of the people working with her. The lines were too corny, and just horrible and unrealistic. The problem I have with most black films is that they are either hardcore thug, or judgmental, preachy, unrealistic and downright corny; there never seems to be any middle ground and everyone is someone you really don't care to know in real life... and the problem with this movie is that it's mostly the latter.. there's a boom mic that kept coming into the shot... oh, and the 30 second cameo from a crack'd out lookin' Whitney Houston didn't help either... (it's probably all she could muster at that time).. Just sayin'... and that one old lady under the dryer looked like Eddie Murphy reprising his role as granny Klump...",1399766400,,1086,4.875675675675676
