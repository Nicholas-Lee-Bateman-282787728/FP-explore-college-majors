7977740,5,B00007L4LD,I LOVE THIS DVD... IT REVEALS A MUCH CLOSER LOOK AT A JUDY GARLAND THAT HER DEAREST FANS ALREADY KNOW... MISS JUDY GARLAND IS A SENSATIONAL HOLLYWOOD SUPERSTAR WITH A 24k GOLD HEART !,1310688000,,183,4.411764705882353
7977741,5,B00007L4LD,"Yes, the picture quality does vary more but I'm still thrilled that they are releasing every episode in whatever condition.  I loved the overture to show 23; Mort brings great energy to his conducting and the camera work is stunning.  I actually clapped when Judy comes on!
I noticed in show 23 the tightrope Judy walks in regards to making herself human and yet always professional.  In her mistakes and occasional visible discomfort or just her high strung nature, she seems fragile and uncertain.  Then she will recover brilliantly with more heart and soul than a galaxy of lesser stars.  Or she will reveal an emotional nuance in the music I hadn't notice before.  That tightrope is what made her electric, fascinating and ultimately the most charismatic of stars.  She brings you into her performance and then reveals or discovers something new in the artistry of singing.
Finally, make sure you watch the outtakes; in particular, Atcheson Topeka.  Her response to a flub made me laugh out loud.",1049155200,8,1000,4.910714285714286
7977742,5,B00007L4LD,"The concert show that is on this DVD is superb. Garland, as usual, was terrific. She sang songs from her Hollywood movies with a musical quality reminiscent of her 1960-1962 concert years while on the road. At the end of the concert, she once agains shows pure magic as she finishes with the song, ""Once in my Lifetime"" dressed as a Puccini-style clown, the same make-up used in the movie The Pirate which she did with Gene Kelly in 1947. It was pure theater, sending chills up anyone spine watching this number, as performed by the greatest singer/entertainer of the 20th century.
The show with Bobby Darin was okay...Musically, he is no match for her.  The best number is when Judy does the song ""More"" as a solo. She just simply soars with this song. In fact, the song fits her like a glove. Look it, Judy Garland can not and should not share the stage with anyone. She is a one-person stage performer. In fact, when she does perform with anyone else, she is the only one on stage that people really look when the cameras are rolling.
This DVD is, though, a must-buy, simply because Judy sings alone in concert form and she is musically at the top of her form.",1049155200,6,1163,4.460093896713615
7977743,4,B00007L4LD,"A further feast for Judy fans and students of vintage television. It must be said that the picture quality here is noticeably variable compared to previous pristine releases in this stunning Garland series. You go from crystal-clear, high contrast images to muddy and less-than-sharp, from one song to the next. I imagine this must be due to the age and state-of-preservation of the material.
But it is extremely gratifying to have the series continued - complete shows along with fascinating outtakes, some legendary: the Jamboree Jones number with local kids football team will be of particular interest to Garland enthusiasts.
Many moments one could mention but in two hours as loaded with goodies as these it is hard to know where to start. I must say, Judy's famous talked interlude in Dirty Hands, Dirty Face, in which she talks about her son Joe, made me deeply uncomfortable - but it's an intensely involving personal statement, very unusual for a prime-time entertainer and there's no denying the sheer emotional whallop when she finally returns, right on cue, to the song! Great to see Darin and Newhart in their primes too - the former does not seem to have any special relationship with Judy here but their duet is excellently rattled off.
Can't wait for Volume 8!",1048723200,4,1276,4.93953488372093
