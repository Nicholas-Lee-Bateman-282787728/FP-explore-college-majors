I found out it sells for hundreds of dollars as it is the only place you can get this rare group of UPA films. I agree with the reviewer that said ""Unicorn in the Garden"" is in the top 50 cartoons of all time, it is a masterpiece based on the James Thurber story of a guy that tries to convince his wife he sees a Unicorn. Christopher Crumpet is another imaginative story about a boy who turns himself into a chicken. The 8 titles are:
Pete Hothead
Popcorn Story
Christopher Crumpet
Unicorn In the Garden
Ballet-Oop
Four Wheels, No Brakes
The Rise of Duton Lang
