Great message that got the kids talking about staying grounded and keeping priorities in order.  I hope the company (Illumin8ed) finds the support they need so they are able to make more films like this.  I can think of some family/friends who would love this as a Christmas gift!!",1319673600,8,415,4.6438356164383565
4886935,5,B005SSBG6Q,A great topic for our world today. Who hasn't struggled with the current economic state? A wonderful faith building message. If you haven't been in this situation you know someone who has. A great movie to watch and share with everyone:),1318377600,9,237,4.804878048780488

4886941,5,B005SSBG6Q,"5 stars for the wonderful meaning this story tells. Life can change,  without us even realizing it, but it is up to each of us to find  hope in joy when life takes a turn for the worse. I love these quotes from the movie:  "" You can't take it with you. Invest in your family."" , "" The most important thing in life aren't things. AND, "" We don't own any of this, it belongs to God."".  This is a Christian film about getting our priorities correct.  The movie starts out with a family living the high life and when they lose everything, they have to go thru trials and figure out what their priorities are and allowing God to be part of the plan. This is not a high budget movie, nor does it have the best actors, but despite it limitations, the underlying messages are clear.",1504310400,,774,4.167785234899329

Unfortunately, for the non suspecting you may be duped into thinking this is Christian, but be forewarned it is not. Not happy to have a movie that is not honestly billed.

Most of the times we have to fall down before we can pick ourselves up to start over. It also showed how selfish the family members were before and after losing everything.

4887005,2,B005SSBG6Q,"He states in the movie that he bounced a check on his landscaper.  When he got back on his feet, he bought his daughter a piece of jewelry. I never caught any part of the movie showing him paying the landscaper back. He should have read  Malachi 3 verse 5 to help him with that, among others. The movie is generating comments that the movie may be LDS based. It did seem like it had some of those elements. I would probably not have rented it had I thought that it was an LDS based movie. As far as acting, they did a great job. The story line is what sort of seemed off to me, if it is about trying to make things right and do right. He can't just run off and make everything great for his family and forget those he may have harmed who are not in his family.",1472774400,,760,3.9607843137254903

4887085,5,B005SSBG6Q,"This movie and its lessons of life and money ill-spent may be one of the few hopes the younger generation will have a chance to learn over the course of the film.  Yes, it includes the family's eventual very slow path to studying the bible, but there is no particular church reference mentioned.  The majority of the film starts out with a middle-class suburb family, already addicted to spending everything they have to present their lifestyle to others - all the while by going into deeper debt.  The audience will quickly see there is little financial foundation in the family's life except to use the plastic cards and roll over more equity from their home to keep the pretenses up.  Yes, they do crash, they do face the selling off of all the ""toys"" on Craigs List and the resulting embarrassment of pride-gone-wrong with their peers.  But it is a story of starting over, only this time with a better understanding of what is real important.  The young generations today with their smart phones and Facebook will rarely get the life lessons needed, except perhaps if they are encouraged to sit down and be ""entertained"" by this film.  You may not agree with the end result of the film, but where the family goes is surely desperation leading them to seek out solid answers that have been written for a thousands of years.",1447632000,2,1326,4.665236051502146

I could not get over the attitude of the daughter and wife in particular- total spoiled brats- but it was good to see how they changed into something much better over the course of their hardships.  A wonderful message about how our society in general places so much value on material things, and not enough on the family and others, yet we wonder why the world is the way it is.

All we need to do is look around our neighborhoods and we see foreclosed homes because people were trying to live out the dream and the truth is, the ""dream"" is not tangible goods, it's allowing Jesus to lead the way and teach you what is important.  The attitude of entitlement of each one is way too real.  But it was also very real in watching the transformation in each one as they began to see what life was truly about.  They became a real family and showed hope to those who may have fallen into the same financial trap.

It sounded good, and after reading the synopsis, I felt this would be great to watch, and encourage others to do the same.  As it stands right now, the only thing I want is the 17 bucks back I spent on the movie.

The acting in this movie leaves a little to be desired.  My hats off to them for trying, however I am thinking it could have been a little better.  And the way the characters act in this movie takes rude and selfishness to a new level.

My 12 year old liked it so much, when I asked her what she wanted for her birthday in November, this was the only thing she thought of right off the bat. It is about a well to do family who winds up having to live in a relative's home after going broke. They realize what is really important through the process. The acting is not A+ Hollywood, but if Hollywood actually put out quality stories like these with A+ actors no one would have to make these independent ones. Sadly they don't. Overlook the B acting, and enjoy!",1356652800,8,608,4.342105263157895
4887137,5,B005SSBG6Q,"This movies was great, it has motivated us (my family and I) to have our things in order according to good financial principles; I am a huge Dave Ramsey fan, and after persevering with my wife to fully follow the baby steps, I think she has finally started to pay attention to them.

I am sure the movie played a big role in this regards; my kids have also watched the movie, and they were attentive and very interested (we also had some kids that watched the movie as well, it was nice to know that a 12 yr old already knows the baby steps to follow).

My daughter was very attentive to the movie (she's just 18), I am sure that now she has a very different perspective about how to handle money (specially since she's about to get her first paying job).

I give this movie a five-star rating, excellent,!!!",1356048000,,808,4.302631578947368

4887139,4,B005SSBG6Q,"I found this movie to be very realistic and a movie that every family would benefit in seeing. This family had it all, or so they thought. The beautiful home, expensive, cars, expensive toys, lavish shopping sprees, catered dinner parties but lacked any true family relationship. The youngest son was left alone while the family was digging itself into a financial hole. A great lesson is to be learned that things in life are easily lost but a love for God creates true love between family members that can't be bought and is not easily lost.",1353283200,3,543,4.666666666666667

4887141,1,B005SSBG6Q,"Based upon the preview I was very hopeful. Unfortunately, this movie fell tragically short. To begin with the movie went close to over the top with the family's rude, disrespectful behavior in an stereotypical attempt to show us what worldliness looks like. This presents too great a challenge to prevent young children from taking on rude, disrespectful behavior which they are already bent to do. Second, the acting was really poor - second rate. The younger brother's character was so pushy, arrogant and prideful that I winded up liking the back-slidden older brother better. Perhaps the final straw was recognizing this movie is obviously written by Mormons and the lifestyle and beliefs are evident. Unfortunately, any born from above Christian who has done their Biblical and theological homework cannot help but see the counterfeit this is.",1351987200,14,848,5.242647058823529
4887142,5,B005SSBG6Q,"This movie is powerful. It is not powerful because of the acting (which is so so at times), or because of a suspenseful plot. It is powerful because of its message. This film cuts through everything that can become so important in life and dares to ask the question, 'What would we do if we lost it all?' What if ... we couldn't rely on credit? What if ... the bad economy stripped us of our homes and dignity? What if we were forced to face our busy lives and saw that all our running and trying to achieve and impress had left us with harried relationships and kids we barely know?

God calls us to something different. He calls the family unit to something more. With Him at the center, family second, and all else third, this movie shows the power in the Bible, faith, and and family as God intended.

Highly recommend!",1350345600,2,823,4.337662337662338

8485465,3,B005SSBG6Q,"This is another example of a Christian movie that values content over quality. Overall, it is a good story about what happens when a family lives beyond their means and loses everything. The mother is a disgusting human being for most of the movie, but the family comes around and learns what is really important. The acting is certainly not Oscar-worthy, with Josh being the most atrociously acted character in the entire film. The sense of family and community is what makes the movie worth watching, not the concept that the Bible is an economics textbook. There do seem to be some plot holes. For example, the medical bills after Cameron's accident would have been staggering. That should have set the family back significantly especially since the dad lost his job, but that's not even mentioned. Also, the mother announcing she's pregnant at the end I found to be totally unnecessary and almost silly.",1527465600,,907,4.896103896103896
8485466,5,B005SSBG6Q,"I have watched this movie several times on Amazon. First of all it has high studio production quality -- audio, lighting, sets, locations, props, acting, music; and an excellent script. It's as professionally produced as any regular theater movie. I have shut off some Christian movies because they were produced so amateurishly I just couldn't sit through them. The best actors are the father, mother, teen daughter and 6-year-old son. The bit roles were also very well played (the father's co-workers, the wife's friends, etc.)

The plot is very good. A very upper-middle-class family living in a McMansion with all the toys. They are spending heavily, up to their eyeballs in debt, and end up losing everything and having to move into the basement of the father's Christian brother.

The father's evolution is portrayed so well. At the beginning of the movie, he just uselessly berates and yells at his wife, teen daughter and teen son, and they just ignore him. He communicates so ineffectively with them (ironic, as he is in marketing). By the end of the movie he has become a true leader of his family; he has the same conversations with the wife, daughter and son, but this time he projects love, a vision and goals and is persuasive and compelling; he communicates instead of berates, and they gladly accept his leadership. Very positive role modeling for men.

The wife's evolution is also interesting. She is a useless, decorative, spendthrift, never cleans or cooks, routinely forgets to feed her 6-year-old (the child actor steals the show!). It's a wonder the 6-year-old doesn't die of starvation or malnutrition as he lives on pizza and chinese takeout. The 6-year-old  is routinely left alone at home while the wife goes out shopping, etc. By the end of the movie, she is so tempered by events and inspired by the example of her Christian sister-in-law that she strives to become a caring and involved mother and homemaker.

The husband and wife also learn about good financial management. I think that's a strong message in this movie, to manage money wisely and not waste it on showy material goods. The father's brother appears to live much more humbly but ironically he is far better off because he has no debt and his modest home and car are fully paid for.

I've read some reviews that refuse to see anything good in this movie because apparently the production company is affiliated with the Mormon church. So what?! The movie is not a commercial for the Mormon church. Everything said or portrayed promotes Christian values.

So, I highly recommend this one.",1521849600,,2581,4.892448512585812
8485467,3,B005SSBG6Q,"Though the message was a good one, the mother bothered me greatly from the very beginning of the movie. Her sheer disregard for her family, her children, her husband was enormously troubling to me. I tend to think her position of gluttony and self-centeredness was a bit overdone. It was especially difficult for me to watch her neglect her youngest son and the best actor of the lot by the way. This woman was basically portrayed as being a habitual shopper, and an avid reader of magazines while neglecting all the other duties that come with being an attentive, loving mother and wife. She was portrayed as being lazy beyond the norm. After the laborers were removed from her life, her true self-became painfully apparent. Unable to find the strength and energy to pick up after herself was particularly appalling to me. From a husband and father point of view, I could not understand how a man could remain committed to such a woman and this comes from a man who is totally against divorce. Yes, she came around a bit in the end, but I never did feel the energy and excitement that typically comes from a transformed life, especially when Abba Father takes control of the reigns. The stay-at-home mom and the youngest boys stole the show! Bravo for such women and children as these. (Spoiler alert) By the way and for what its worth, the ending seemed very unrealistic to me. Through the extreme stress that comes with losing everything, when would a couple find the time and energy to even think about having another child? Instead of trying to focus on the 'miracle' spin, the father should have asked everyone what they enjoyed most about their new life and end with a solid, transformative prayer instead of fading out just as a prayer begins. The gluttony, idolatry and debt spin were realistic to me, especially with the display of all the boy's toys and luxury vehicles, and the unnecessary purchasing of 'stuff'. The moral of the story? There is nothing more liberating and exhilarating than living a debt free life, something we all should strive to achieve with diligence and perseverance while allowing the Father to lead the way!",1519603200,,2145,4.753351206434316
