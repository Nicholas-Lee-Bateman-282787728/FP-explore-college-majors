7803995,3,6300174603,"Several reviews written for ""The Bolshoi Ballet"" are incorrectly  reviewing a performance of Giselle starring Ulanova.  This is not the content of this tape.  This tape is a survey of several ballet excerpts, shown both in rehersal and on stage.  The lighting is poor, as is the camera work.",1232409600,,291,4.877551020408164
7803996,5,6300174603,"I have owned this video on VHS for many years now, and was surprised and delighted that it has been released on DVD. For any and all Ballet lovers, this is a must have for your dance library. This is The Bolshoi at its peak, The Bolshoi that was denied to the Western world until this London tour in 1956 and subsequent tours to the USA in 1959 and '62. I was fortunate in my youth to see Ulanova in 1959 at the old Metropolitan Opera House,truly a great artist, not to be forgotten! The VHS version offers 7 selections, although I noticed that the DVD offers only a total of six.

1-Dance of the Tartars from The Fountain of Bakhchiserai

2-Spanish Dance from Swan Lake

3-Polonaise and Cracovienne from Ivan Susanin

4-Walpurgisnacht from Faust (Raisa Struchkova..WOW)

5-Spring Water

6-The Dying Swan (Ulanova,another WOW)

7-Giselle (Ulanova/Fadeyechev, abridged version)

Remember, this is 1956 audio/video technology but so what,the entire program is a classic treasure.",1178582400,23,977,4.950920245398773
7803997,3,6300174603,"This semi-documentary film about the Bolshoi Ballet has flaws, but there are enough good performances and interesting classroom scenes to make it  fun to watch.  Unfortunately, the scenes that supposedly document the  offstage activities of the dancers and students are very staged and  sometimes laughable, and I found the score that accompanied the  choreographed classroom scenes irritating.  It's also frustrating that the  format isn't letterboxed, so the dancers occasionally disappear.
Several  complete pieces are presented--""Ravel Waltzes,"" with Natalia  Bessmertnova, ""Paganini,"" Ekaterina Maximova, and Ravel's  ""Bolero,"" with an ever-growing host of dancers stamping their way  up and down stairs.  For me, the best was the last: a Russian festival  scene and gypsy dance from the ballet ""The Stone Flower.""  The  gypsy woman is portrayed by sultry Natalia Kasatkina, one of the Bolshoi's  best character dancers, the pas de deux features radiant ballerina Raisa  Struchkova (who starred in the Bolshoi's filmed version of  ""Cinderella"" in 1961), and there's plenty of Russian character  dancing.
Compare this video with three documentaries about the Kirov,  Russia's other famous ballet company: ""Children of Theatre  Street"" (1978), ""Backstage at the Kirov"" (1984) and  ""The Leningrad Legend"" (1989). There are also two full-length  productions of ""The Stone Flower,"" the Bolshoi version (1990) and  the Kirov version (1991).",966384000,5,1439,5.77511961722488
7803998,3,6300174603,"The murky photography of life as a ballerina backstage is minimal and we see a number of ballets - DYING SWAN, PAGANINI, STONE FLOWER, - best of the lot is the BOLERO.  Camera stays in the center of a widescreen production  so often we hear music but see no dancers.  Odd little thing. Oscar nom for  Scoring.",934934400,6,309,4.368421052631579
7803999,5,6300174603,"Arnold Huskell, an english ballet critic, did not applaud Ulanova because he was affraid of destroying the harmony which Ulanova created on stage. It is hard to write something about Galina Ulanova in ""Giselle"": the  opinion would be too banal and it would be soundless in the chorus of  praised opinions. If the human civilization and culture would suddenly  disappear from the face of the Earth the role of Galina Ulanova in  ""Giselle"" would be one of the masterpieces of harmony with the  aid of which people could restore the definition of beauty, harmony and  pure love.",926294400,13,575,4.876288659793815
