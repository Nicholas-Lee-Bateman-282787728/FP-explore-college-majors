8361809,2,B001SHTWTY,"Dully paced. Impressively filmed and well-acted, but functions very poorly as a movie. Very little characterization. Plays out like a history lesson, a straightforward list of events and encounters. Neither engaging nor entertaining.",1495843200,,233,6.090909090909091
8361810,5,B001SHTWTY,"Very interesting history movie about the Cuban revolution, and how Che tried to spread the revolution to Latin America but encounter many tactical problems and opposition from the Bolivian communist party.",1493596800,,205,5.645161290322581

8361813,3,B001SHTWTY,"This is a lavish production in two parts. The first part starts briefly with the meeting of Ernesto Guevara and Fidel Castro in Mexico , and a few minutes later we are already crossing the waters on the Granma direction Cuba. Very little is said about the motivation of the participants apart from that they abhor the maltreatment of ""the people"". Next we are in the Sierra Madre with an ever in numbers increasing rebel army and slowly on the way towards Havana, were we don't reach in the film. The action in the first part stops at the surrender of the town of Santa Clara. It is all beautifully filmed and one gets a good idea of the tediousness and drudgery of the long trek through the mountains with occasional skirmishes with the Batista army, but what is lacking - in a major way - is any insight in the man Che Guevara, what motivates and drives him, why is he there? I was also wondering about  his portrayal vis a vis Fidel, which seems too slavish and admiring to be true.
The second part skips the taking of Havana and the first years of the Cuban revolution and brings us immediately to the Bolivian countryside. This part again brought a good sense of the tediousness of the march through a remote and wild part of the country, trying (in vain) to convince the peasants to join the struggle and comes close to my memory of Che's diary of those days which I read years ago. Again though there is little on offer to make us understand the man himself. It is as if the film supposes that you have read up and know enough about Che , and is content here to provide you with pretty pictures and some action as background illustration. Benicio Del Toro looks credible as  Che. There's a short cameo of Matt Damon as a German missionary in part 2.",1411257600,5,1756,4.383435582822086
