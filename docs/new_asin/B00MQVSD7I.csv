6600185,5,B00MQVSD7I,all I want to do is watch this show!! where can I find it? how do I get it? why does Netflix only have one season?! grrrrr!,1411344000,4,123,3.5925925925925926
6600186,5,B00MQVSD7I,This is a very good show from British TV and I'm glad Disney Channel started airing last October. I can't wait to see season 2 in October on Disney Channel.,1410998400,2,156,4.233333333333333
6600187,5,B00MQVSD7I,"Wolfblood is one of my favorite shows, mainly because season 1 and 2 are so well done! Maddy, Rhydian, Shannon and Tom are an awesome cast of characters. Season 2 is very intense and I recommend it to anyone. The concept of 'wolfbloods' is set apart from typical werewolf tropes and the setting in Stoneybridge in the UK offers a fun twist that American viewers will appreciate. Maddy and Rhydian also have a chemistry that makes both of the main chars unforgettable.",1465171200,,467,4.7073170731707314

6600189,5,B00MQVSD7I,Great show,1459209600,,10,4.5
6600190,5,B00MQVSD7I,"My family and I have now watched most of Season 2 and we've become even more intrigued by both the characters and their stories. Maddie has matured but the relationships between the group are edgy at times, which of course makes it more fun to view. New character, Jana, adds a twist here and there and gives the others more with which to deal.

The best part of Wolfblood is the dialogue/banter between the characters and the always underlying secret that they share. Tom and Shannon add the perfect support in both hiding that secret and exploring it deeper.

Overall, I recommend this series to families with adolescents or young teens as it has something for those age groups, as well as for adults.",1456099200,,703,4.661290322580645

6600231,5,B00MQVSD7I,"This is another Werewolf story with a delightful twist.  The werewolves are not all total monsters some are just good folk trying to live among humans in an uneasy harmony.  Wolfblood: Season 2 is the continuation of the saga of a young lady coming of age as a female werewolf.  Her parents are normal everyday folk who are also werewolves.  This werewolf family has all the normal human family rituals and complications.  This awesome family of werewolves also has its own unique rituals like locking their entire membership in a strong room during the nights of the full moon.  The make these lock downs appear almost normal as a holiday get away or picnic.

The young lady in Wolfblood: Season 2 is dealing with her own realization of what it means to live as a werewolf among humans.  There are decisions that must be made.  Who do you trust and with how much.  Also because she is a young lady werewolf she finds the company of a young man werewolf.  Their relationship while generally awesome is not without its bumps along the way.  There are feral werewolves who endulge their wild side without trying to fit in among the humans.  This boyfriend comes from a family of ferals and they want him back.  So along with the werewolf story Wolfblood: Season 2 is also a story about choices on many levels.

The plots are often rich and while the special effects are not stellar they do not have to be.  The stories, the people and the acting is so good one forgets any special effects flubs you might see.  You end up loving this family of werewolves and their human friends. I've purchased many werewolf themed DVD sets in my life both movies and TV series and this is one of the best ever.  This is a British Series so you will need to be used to the British form of English.  If you have ever watched British Comedy and understood \ liked it you will be well suited to enjoy Wolfblood: Season 2. In Wolfblood: Season 2  the pace of the story picks up and is tighter.  Wolfblood: Season 2  earned my five star rating because; yes it is that good.  PERIOD!",1416355200,6,2059,4.461126005361931

8674130,2,B00MQVSD7I,"I really love this show but this review is not a reflection of the show itself but more to do with the production of the DVDs which I find to be very disappointing. First, on my copy of the season one DVD I noticed a glitch in episode two; it happens at 0:10:38 when Maddy approaches Shannon at her locker to find out if she's okay. In the original cut Shannon informs Maddy that Rhydian made her feel better but on the DVD it jumps awkwardly to Shannon telling Maddy to bring her camera on Saturday and then walking away. It is from this point on that I start to wonder if this is going to be a common occurrence and as I soldier through my marathon of the DVDs I can't quite shake the feeling that something is wrong. Which leads me to my grievance with this particular DVD, in the last episode there is a scene that has been edited out. It's the scene that takes place outside of Maddy's house between Tom, Shannon, and Rhydian (I don't want to say too much because of spoilers but anyone who has watched the original cut should know what I'm talking about.) So basically I suspect that some of these episodes have been edited. Has anyone else had this problem or noticed scenes missing that they remember being in the original?",1484956800,,1231,4.333333333333333
