7911902,4,6305581940,"I must say I was never a fan of old T.V. movies but I have seen a few. And with most T.V. movies of the 70s the picture quality is not that great in the beginning but smooths out as the film goes along. Patty Duke and Frank Michael Liu both do a great job in this film although the acting is not all that great it is still very watchable.

 One thing I really liked in this flick is that Anne Baxter tries to hold the two together, very sweet! The ending is a little twisted and not expected but sad all the same. As one Amazon customer suggested must watch movie. I hope this movie comes to DVD.",1185235200,5,596,3.9583333333333335
7911903,5,6305581940,"This is one of  Patty's great movies.  Very touching to the heart but with a sad ending.  A young Japanese man & young American woman fall in love and then the Pearl Harbor attack. Their love never dies but the ending, ):  well, it's not what you would expect, you must see it.  Not all endings are happy  ones. ):  This movie is a keeper and will be in my video library until I end, (:  misskittykatt ^..^  (Judiea)",1009670400,10,416,4.1645569620253164
