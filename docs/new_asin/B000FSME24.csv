2584346,5,B000FSME24,"Entertainment doesn't get any more wholesome than this - a Superhero who advocates eating healthy and exercising, and a scene stealing super villain who never wins.  With a cast of three human actors and half a dozen puppets, the messages for kids will hit you over the head with a hammer, but it's all good fun anyway.

This DVD has four episodes, three from Season One, and one from Season Two.

1. Swiped Sweets: The kids help Mayor Milford by making a huge birthday cake for Bessie, but then disaster strikes as someone steals it. Robbie appears as a detective, and accuses Sportacus of the crime.  He cons his way into a conviction, and Sportacus ends up behind bars while the kids try to prove his innocence.

2. Dancing Duel: Stephanie takes part in a dancing competition, but as her only competition is Robbie Rotten, she doesn't practice, and ends up unprepared on the big day.

3. Remote Control: Pixel creates the ultimate universal remote control and then realizes that sometimes it's better to do things for yourself.

4. My Tree house: Another contest, this time to build a tree house. Stingy learns about team work after initially sabotaging the team efforts.

You know your kids will love this, so what're you waiting for?  Add this to your shopping cart today.

8126261,5,B000FSME24,"Sportacus and Stephanie:
sports candy = fruits and vegetables (better than ""real food"" which is what we called these two before)
junk food or healthy food: the prince and princess toss out this query before we eat anything
""let's go play and exercise first"" = anything that encourages mine to say this gets two thumbs up from me
Such a wonderful show with a nice Icelandic touch. How can we go wrong?",1235692800,,400,4.569444444444445

The message is perfect and the same on all episodes, eat healthy & exersize. The music is addicting and really motivates my son to get up and dance.
I will always reccomend this show to any family with young children,",1188604800,,261,4.346938775510204
8126264,5,B000FSME24,"At first, I was put off of the show because of the title: ""Lazytown"".  With so many shows nowadays conveying negative messages, why bother with another one?  Well, the first episode I saw of this show was ""Dancing Duel"" and I realized that there was a positive message there.  I bought this DVD since it had that episode on it and the other three episodes are just as good.  Since I screen anything I buy for my nephews, if I don't enjoy it, I know they won't enjoy it.  Hopefully, the reverse it true in this case, because I *love* the Lazytown series!

The sets and costumes are colorful and attention grabbing.  The plots are simple and convey a good message.  The characters are somewhat believable ... I still have a hard time imagining someone like Sportacus being in the real world, but I'm sure there *are* people like him out there.

All in all, this series is wonderful and I recommend it for children, teens (they could use the life lessons taught in these shows as well) and adults.",1179792000,,994,4.477777777777778

8126267,5,B000FSME24,"My 4-year-old loves LazyTown, and it is one of the few CD's I allow him to watch without me. The stories are simple but convey the old message: Get moving, don't eat too many sweets, get enough sleep, stick together as a team... yet the animation is young and colorful and positive. Cool music, too!",1167782400,,299,4.454545454545454
