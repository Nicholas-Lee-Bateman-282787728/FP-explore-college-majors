6448785,4,B00KUDW2U8,"For the price of this release you expect a premium product, unfortunately this release misses the mark in a few areas.

Firstly for the good.  The show is an easy 4/5 and only time will tell if it will deserve a 5.  There's plenty of opinions on the Internet that are expressed better than I ever could so I won't bore you with mine.  Since there are only four episodes on the disc there is plenty of room for them to breath so you get a beautiful transfer that's clean and sharp.  The only picky thing that bothered me is that when you get a close-up of the characters the picture gets a bit ""softer"".  It's as if instead of drawing the face on the full frame they draw it smaller and simply zoom in for a close-up.  It's comparative to regular film where the director wants a close-up of an actor but realizes that he didn't shoot one so they optically zoom in on a frame.  This release comes along with an English dub which is acceptable, there is nothing wrong technically and the only thing you can agree or disagree on is whether the dub's artistically competitive.  Along with the show you get a remix soundtrack with some great songs, however half of it is nothing more than just instrumental mixes.  The discs and cases they are housed feel like they should considering the price.  The postcards are also very nice and they feel/look so much better then anything Funimation and co. have ever released, you can feel the high quality paper they were printed on as well as the quality of the printing.

Before I continue I just want to add that I did know what I was getting (on-disc and external special features) before my purchase.

And then there is the bad - poster, the box both cases are housed in, and on-disc special features.  This isn't a just a problem with this release the the poster included doesn't feel anything special.  It's double sided and around A4 size which is to small for my liking.  When I want a ""poster"" i want a ""poster"" and not just some small piece of paper.  The on-disc extras are the standard opening and closing textless credits as well as next episode web previews.  You get these with any other releases that cost even less than half what you pay here.  My biggest disappointment is the box.  Now, I don't mind that it isn't a chipboard  that isn't the problem.  A few years ago I purchased the Madoka limited editions and they to didn't come in a chipboard box but in a very beautiful ""leathery"" feeling sort of paper and gold writing that still looks as good as the day I bought it.  Have a look at most of your slip cases or cardboard box and notice that after a few years it starts to fall apart even without you handling them often, not with the Madoka Limited Edition release.  With these Kill la Kill limited editions we don't get anything like it.  The box is made of a nice smooth paper that's made from a higher product then most but already the edges are starting to lose their new look.

In the end it comes to the individual wheter this release is worth the high price, to me it really isn't but I will continue to purchase future releases as I want the best available release for this product, just like the 501's that I paid $200 and the $150 ADIDAS sneakers.",1421798400,5,3218,4.375420875420875

If this were say, the series box set I might buy it, but this is only for 4 episodes! That's ridiculous. So Aniplex, I want to make this clear: You're not losing customers to piracy, you're DRIVING them to it! Now I'm off to go buy the entire series of Attack on Titan on blu-ray for less than the price of this 4 episode ""set"" while I just download this show.",1413072000,168,536,4.424242424242424
6448789,5,B00KUDW2U8,"This is probably one of the best shows I've seen in years. Very rarely I come across a show where just about all the characters are likeable, with a plot (for how absolutely insane it was) that was awesome to experience, that has an epic OST, and breakneck pacing that takes you on one of the wildest Tv rollercoaster rides I've ever been on.

That being said the only thing that may turn people away from the show is the fanservice and that's if they interpret it just plainly as fanservice for the sake of fanservice. IMO this show never had fanservice for no reason if you consider the plot. If you pay attention to the plot, there is actually a legitimate reason why the outfits are as skimpy as they look (Which I'll leave for the viewer to discover). But just like something out of Family Guy/South Park or, hell, even Spongebob at times, whenever there's bits of fanservice/nudity, there's no naughty bits showing and is usually executed in a humorous way. And to be honest, after about episode 4, you start to become desensitized to the skimpyness of the outfits, so it really didn't bother me.

Overall this is a show that takes everything and executes it in the most over-the-top ways which I found to be very fun and enjoyable; to the point where I've re watched the series to get that same fun and enjoyment again. It has excellent replay value. The price may be a bit high for a set of the first 4 episodes (Damn you Aniplex), but for me IMO, especially the limited edition, is a worthwhile purchase if you are a fan of the show.

Highly recommend to anyone who's looking for a fun show to watch.",1410307200,3,1609,4.447457627118644

Nonon Jakuzure is one deviant character (actually all them are) and the creator seems to have a fascination for panty crotch shots.  Yes, it took a long time to watch all the episodes.  However, some of you may find the American football player portion funny to watch.  Kill la Kill is something you won't forget after watching.",1409443200,,424,4.454545454545454
6448792,1,B00KUDW2U8,"For those of you not familiar with Aniplex, they are one of the few major licensers of anime outside of Japan (and within as well). Unfortunately that means that a good chunk of anime that gets licensed to the west must go through Aniplex. Unfortunately still, they tend to treat anime as a premium. As such, you can never expect to find any of their anime at a reasonable price. And by the looks of the pattern with Kill la Kill, it seems they only mean to continue increasing the price of their DVDs and Blu-Rays. As of the time I write this review, Fate/Zero on blu-ray is $230 and Gurren Lagann on blu-ray, limited release, is $620. Chances are if you're the kind of person who liked Kill la Kill, you'd probably like those shows, too. I did, but I'd never spend that amount on a single anime. If all the Kill la Kill sets are like this, it'd likely end up costing over $400! By comparison you could buy all of Cowboy Bebop on blu-ray for $90 and Steins;Gate for $30, both licensed by Funimation, plus Gargantia for $60. That's $180 for three series, compare to paying $400 to one. Just for fun, let's throw in the three season box set of Game of Thrones for $110, and that'd only be $290 compared to Kill la Kill's $400. That's three popular anime, plus three seasons of the most poplular show on HBO right now. I could add The upcoming Ghost in the Shell blu-ray for $25 and the Arise set which contains 2 movies for $35, bringing us up to $350. To match that $400, let's add Nausicaa and Castle in the Sky's $25 blu-ray releases. So for $400, we get 3 popular anime series, 3 seasons of Game of Thrones, 3 Ghost in the Shell movies, and 2 Ghibli movies, all on blu-ray. Compare that to Kill la Kill, which I will forego buying physical copies.

Kill la Kill is a fantastic show, and more people should watch it. It is currently on Netflix for US viewers and those with access to Hola or similar apps. That being said, save your money for something reasonably priced.",1408665600,198,1973,4.3468834688346885
6448793,5,B00KUDW2U8,"This review is for the entire 24 episode series.

This show has it all - surreal humor and inappropriate attire, bloodshed and perversity, weird transformations and special powers, and an explanation for everything. It starts pretty simple and evolves into a weirdly complex plot. Characters shift from protagonist to antagonist and back again in the course of a few episodes. And while fairly predictable at times, the fight scenes become more grandiose as the show goes on, with increasing gore, epic destruction, and creative torture as the show progresses.

I mentioned that there is an explanation for everything. There was a lot of seriously ridiculous stuff going on at the beginning, that all fits into the puzzle. And there are a lot of seemingly mundane plot points that become more convoluted and weird as the show goes on. Things I forgot about suddenly pop back up, and in some way that fits into the story without feeling like the creators are grasping for ideas. Maybe they were, and maybe this show was made up as it went along. But whether or not that's the case, it was put together extremely well.

In summary, the creators put a lot of effort into making this show as kinetic and unpredictable as possible, while keeping characters around long enough to develop complex stories and relationships. And while it gets more serious as it goes on, the absurdity was ratcheted up so high that even in the most dark moments the show still retains its sense of humor. And finally, I think 24 is a good number of episodes, there was a lot of story paths to go down and I feel like none of them went on too long.

So that's the show, Kill la Kill. The name is probably the only thing about the show I'd change, although showing a",1407369600,3,1739,4.636363636363637

6448804,5,B00KUDW2U8,"OK we all know Aniplex totally sucks. SAO, Gurren Lagann, The original Fullmetal Alchemist. They suck for price.

Now to Kill la Kill. Kill la Kill is an amazing show. It is a marvelous follow-up to Gurren Lagann which was a show about drill bits! Drill Bits! Well this show is just as insane. It's about clothes that are alive and swords that are Scissors. Studio Gainax and Trigger cranked the action to 11 and somehow manages to keep the momentum fresh all the way to the end. But just like Gurren Lagann the last half has builds on the simple premise to have a surprisingly amount of heat felt emotion. There are plenty of shockers throughout as well. While this show does not kill off its main characters like Gurren Lagann did, you still feel for Ryuko and many other characters as the story unfolds. Yes, this show is nuts, it's blatantly insane to say the least. But If you like that and also like your shows to have character development and a really good story, you got to watch this show.

On another note, I downloaded an app called Anime HUB from the Windows app store. I got this show, all of Sword Art Online, and many other Animplex only shows for free. maybe we will get lucky and in a few years Aniplex's license to this show will expire like the original Fullmetal Alchemist and FUNimation will pick it up.

6448821,5,B00KUDW2U8,"Ive seen the first couple of episode of the anime Kill la Kill, which recently started airing on Saturday nights/Sunday mornings, and Ive got to say, it is just plain ridiculous. But its a good kind of ridiculous. In fact, I think that this series is a microcosm for everything that is wonderfully ridiculous about anime as a medium.
I first encountered Kill la Kill in person at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International. One of the rituals I have every time I am lucky enough to attend this celebration of pop culture is to wind down, rest, and process the long day by watching some anime I hadnt seen before in the viewing rooms late at night. Honestly, its one of the things I look forward to the most every year when I go to this con. The staff appears to favor the sub side of the anime viewing debate. This was a slight difference for me, as I am a dub person, but thats another argument. At any rate, my first viewing of this anime was the Japanese audio with subtitles. It was not something I usually do, but here it did not bother me in the slightest, as the awesome stupidity was even more obvious. Only one episode each of every anime is shown in these rooms, and for Kill la Kill, the episode was 3, where Ryoko fights Satsuki. This was the perfect episode to get across the series over-the-top tone, fight mechanics, and character relationships. So much later when the series came to Adult Swim, I was able to see all these things fleshed out further. As of this writing, the series is still airing, and with only one episode per week, will be for a while yet. But Ive still seen enough already to say that it seems to me that this anime is like a parody of all the most common stereotypes and tropes found in modern anime. But this isn't a shaming parody, more like a playful acknowledgement of clichs and a celebration of what makes anime so good. In a sense, I would say that the intention of Kill la Kill is very much like what Enchanted is for Disney Princess films, if that makes sense.
Kill la Kill is a cornucopia of anime tropes. The main character Ryoko Matoi, has the standard dead parent and revenge story, straight from the Princess Bride. I was practically waiting for her to say it throughout the series thus far. Everything you could imagine from anime tropes from the last few decades is present here, and completely played up with a mix of seriousness and poking fun. The series is set in a school, complete with sailor uniforms. These uniforms can give special powers to the wearers, after a transformation sequence of course. Ryokos is even sentient, as the talking inanimate object that is the heroines partner in combat. She has the distinctive weapon shaped like a common household object, in this case a pair of scissors. The transformation sequence of the outfit makes it much skimpier, almost like a risqu strippers outfit, and the characters often point this out. Theres an impossible-to-pronounce finishing move thats used at the end of every fight, which absorbs the losers power, while stripping them of course. The villain is spoken of as having absolute power, both in authority and fighting skill, and the heroine has to fight her way through a veritable army of steadily stronger followers in order to get to her. This is of course after challenging the villain to an early fight to get humiliated, so now the heroin must train to get stronger for the rematch. Of course, the villain is the head of the student council, and the other members are her lieutenants. The character roster includes the bishonen teacher, the ditz sidekick who is way too hyper, the family that eats way too fast, the pervert father, and annoying younger sibling who has adult vocabulary. Characters sympathetic backstories are shown in flashbacks during their fights. The fights themselves are ridiculous, with over-the-top attack and armor names, and insane amounts of destructive force. Lectures of the nature of mankind and society abound, with the villain representing supreme order and denial of freedom. Pretty much everything I can think of from poplar anime from the last few decades is present here.
Despite all of these clichs, the anime remains very interesting and tons of fun to watch. It is completely ludicrous and nonsensical, but because its aware of it, it comes across more tongue-in-cheek. As far as Im concerned, its simply delightful. Its just the right balance of complete seriousness and not an ounce of seriousness. It knows exactly when to be sincere and when to pour on the ham and cheese. I haven't seen the whole series yet, and with 24 episodes, theres quite a bit left in the series to date, but I am very eager to see the rest of this seriously ridiculous story. Make no mistake, there is plenty of raunchiness and tons of fanservice, and if you can handle that (and are old enough), then I definitely recommend this series. Catch up and see what youve been missing. Then get the rest of this wonderfully stupid anime.",1428883200,,4976,4.662116040955631

I often import Japanese Blu-Rays if I really like a particular show. Because of this, I frequently complain about the fact that North America's anime releases are never similar in quality to their Japanese counterparts. With Kill la Kill, Aniplex have (mostly) given me what I wanted, and I'm pretty happy about it. The packaging is nice and looks great on my shelf, the menus are sexy, and the dub is excellent.

Speaking of the dub, I should touch on that briefly: It's very well-cast, and the ADR direction is spot-on. Some of the voices are a little different from their Japanese counterparts, but not in an audacious way like you'd expect from other anime licensees. (Looking at you, Sentai Filmworks) The new cast makes the characters appealing in unique ways, without being a significant departure from the original.

(Yes, I'm aware that's a pretty eclectic mix there...)  A friend and I decided on a whim to watch ""Kill La Kill"" at one point, and to be honest I don't think either of us had any idea what to expect.  Going in blind was, perhaps, the best option, as nothing could have prepared us for the sheer over-the-top insanity of this anime.  And somehow, it is glorious in its insanity and completely unrestrained attitude toward everything, and one of the most entertaining anime I've ever watched.

WARNING:  Despite Amazon rating this anime as G, it is NOT for kids -- there are copious amounts of violence, blood, nudity (no genitalia but still...), and even allusions to molestation and incest.  Watch at your own discretion.

""Kill La Kill"" follows Ryuko, a transfer student at a new high school... a school ruled with an iron fist not by its teachers, but by its student council, with the president Satsuki maintaining absolute control over both the students and the city and maintaining power through special Goku uniforms worn by her most trusted and loyal students.  Said uniforms imbue their wearer with incredible strength and abilities, and it seems no other student can stand against Satsuki's council.  But Ryuko has a uniform of her own -- Senketsu, who not only grants Ryuko incredible power but is sentient and more than a little snarky.  With Senketsu's help -- and a blade taken from half of a massive set of scissors, Ryuko sets out to defeat Satsuki's council and uncover the truth behind her father's death, a truth she's sure Satsuki knows.  But as she battles her way through the absurdly powerful student council, Ryuko learns there's more to the Goku uniforms -- and her and Senketsu's pasts -- than she realizes, and that there's far more than a single school at stake...

As stated before, there's a LOT of violence in this anime, but it's far more cartoony than realistic.  And blood and nudity actually become plot points as the story goes on, albeit somewhat absurd plot points.  This entire anime is over the top and crazy in everything it does, so fans of more serious shows like ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" might look at it askance... but somehow its over the top, exaggerated nature just adds to the fun.  And it isn't afraid to pause the insanity for some more serious, emotional moments, though still includes plenty of humor to balance it out.

And while the action and battle scenes are undoubtedly this anime's biggest selling point, I appreciate that the characters have been developed as well.  Ryuko is a grim young woman, but it's hard not to identify with her quest to learn more about herself and find her place even as she hunts her father's killer.  Her best friend, Mako, is a complete airhead but makes a likable foil to the more cynical Ryuko, contributing much of the series' humor.  Satsuki could have been a flat villain, but pains are taken to make her sympathetic, even honorable, and her student council members become nuanced and sympathetic characters as well.  And Senketsu, of all characters, is quite likable... for a sentient school uniform.

""Kill La Kill"" isn't for all tastes, and the violence and nudity might be off-putting to some.  But it still manages to be a wild and crazy ride, and one I quite enjoyed.",1507161600,,3447,4.775716694772344
