420914,5,6302069270,"It should be noted that this is the original AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL version

and not the mediocre SANDY FRANK version from the 1980s.",1092700800,8,133,5.045454545454546
420915,3,6302069270,"I remember watching ""Return of the Giant Monsters,"" aka ""Gamera vs Gyaos"" when I was much younger. I loved every minute of it, because it was so ""out-there,"" so nutty and contrived that I was foaming at the mouth with its kaiju-goodness. Now, I've found a movie that tops it: ""The Magic Serpent.""

I am very grateful to Retromedia for releasing both of these movies on DvD (and the Magic Serpent especially, because you probably won't find it anywhere else), because they are both such sheer campy fun that they would HAVE to be on the same DvD.

What's great about these films is that they aren't ""good"" per-say, but they aren't supposed to be. They're supposed to be FUN. People who criticize these movies for being cheaply made and poorly dubbed basically have nothing better to do with their time. It's pointless to really criticize these movies unless you're a real kaiju-fan and know about this kind of stuff. But even with the critical eye of the fanboy (or fangirl), these flicks are hard to nitpick about because they are so...much...fun!

The only thing keeping this movie from getting higher marks is the fact that there's nothing else on the disc besides a scene selection and Retro's website. Plus, the quality of the print is pretty bad, but that's to be expected, these being such old films, and Retro probably having limited resources.

I highly recommend this DvD to anyone who is a fan of good-'ol giant monster rampages, or to anyone who is looking to introduce children to the kaiju genre (but not before a few Godzilla movies).",1092096000,10,1548,4.722222222222222
420916,5,6302069270,"Back in the day, these versions of RETURN OF THE GIANT MONSTERS and THE MAGIC SERPENT regularly appeared on Saturday Creature Feature on fuzzy UHF TV.(I remember watching RETURN OF THE GIANT MONSTERS on Channel 6 from New Bedford,abruptly put on at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, because a baseball game got rained-out). They are the AIP-TV versions, as the widescreen prints of the films were never shown theaterically in the US, so, they don't exist in the US(only in Japan). That said, what we have are great copies of some vintage films from a time gone by. THE MAGIC SERPENT(bonus on the disk) is a Toei entry from l966, one of their very few forays(aside from the Johnny Sokko series) into Kaiju-type films as mostly they stayed the course with superheroes vs human-sized monsters. It's also highly entertaining and very colorful in ways US films never were. Alot of young people today complain if the disk isn't in widescreen or doesn't have dozens of extras. This 16mm copy of these films are the best document of their time, and with a better picture than I ever saw them on TV so long ago...",1090713600,13,1097,4.65979381443299
420917,5,6302069270,"This is a fun movie to watch over and over.  It has all of the elements which make Kaiju movies so enjoyable.  It has the ever unpopular precocious child who seems to never stop being irritating or knowing everything.  There is greed on everyone's part - the farmers, the big corporation, etc.  We have the evil monster awakened to terrorize the world.  And finally there is the ""friend of children eveywhere"".

Thats the only reason its good because Gamera had a hard time defeating this Vampire. Gamera is still aim towards kids but they blood splattering from the monster and people being eating that I found pretty cool. But overal its alright Gamera film better then

Because of its second lazer-beem throut, it can't turn its neck(its weakness) and for some reason it can't stand sunlight.  This one really gave Gamera a hard time of it cutting his arm near to the bone.
 This monster was very popular.  It apears twice in the new Gamera movies: Gamera1:Gardian of the Unervirse and Gamera3:Awakening of Iris.  Also, Gaos is the main Foe in the Fan based Gamera4 featuring an all poerful white Gaos.",1068768000,,545,4.75531914893617
420920,3,6302069270,"This is the 3 instalment in the first Gamera series. Gamera has now gone from a fire breathing menace to the ""friend of the children"". The acting in the film varies from the silliest of characters the very serious ones. The special effects, and the miniatures are many - They have most likely spent a great deal of effort and money on it. Unfortunately the same doesn't go for the monster suits; The Gyaos have a horrible design! Thinking about it; Perhaps is it a well planned strategy - Godzilla underwent during this period design changes, to make him more appealing for children. A too realistic Gyaos, might have been too much for the little ones...
Story; Earth trembles and volcanic activity over the whole Japanese archipelago, unfold this new adventure. Mount Fuji erupts, scientist boards a helicopter to investigate. Suddenly, while sweeping the area, yellow energy beams, originating from the ground cuts the helicopter in half! There's confusion - Nobody can tell what really happened!
A journalist, led by a local boy, goes on a nearby mountain to investigate a mysterious green light. Horror lies however a head... The green light emanates from a horrible flying reptilian monster - The Gyaos!
The journalist gets quickly eaten, and Gyaos grabs his next snack - The little boy...
Suddenly Gamera appears; He/she manage to get the boy from the Gyaos. But gyaos is not an easy opponent; The ray, emitting from the mouth cuts Gamera severely...  The boy and Gamera manage to escape; Both Gamera and a airstrike have failed - Is there any hope at all?
I gave this film 3 stars; The special effects are many, and the film has the only real air battle between two monsters, that I've ever seen!
The story however is pretty much straight forward, Gyaos suit is horrible, and the producer's urge to appeal to the children is, at times, too much for my taste.
This film is not available in the US at the moment - However there's a way; A dvd box, which carry English subtitles, containing the four first films (1965 - 68), is available in Japan. Japanese Dvd:s does however have a region 2 coding. How to get it from Japan? Try to find CD JAPAN, a Japanese site, in English.",1004227200,2,2180,4.706806282722513
420990,4,6302069270,"The Magic Serpent was one of those movies that they didn't play over and over again on Creature Feature type showcases so I've had fond memories of it into adulthood.  I was curious to monitor my reaction to it after all these years. This movie does not disappoint. It's not the best samurai/ninja drama, and it's not the best giant monster movie out there, but it is one of the best fusion of the two.

The plot is based on a Japanese folktale, but it is a pretty standard samurai movie plot.  The leader of the Oumi province, Lord Ogata, is betrayed and murdered by his top aide, Yuki Daijo, with the assistance of evil ninja, Orochimaru.  Lord Ogata's son, Ikazuchimaru, escapes, is raised and taught by an old ninja, Dojin.  Fast forward and Ikazuchimaru is an adult.  He meets a young lady named, Tsunade, who is looking for her father, who abandoned the family.  Dojin is murdered by Orochimaru, but before he dies, he tells Ikazuchimaru what happened to his real parents.  If you watch formula samurai fiction regularly, you know what happens - on his journey, Ikazuchimaru meets up with people who become victims of the evil lord and must be avenged. He meets up with Tsunade again, and you know who Tsunade's father turns out to be.

When the showdown takes place between Ikazuchimaru and Orochimaru, they use their animal ninja magic and one turns into a giant sea serpent, the other into a giant toad.  Add a giant spider to the mix thanks to Tsunade's grandmother, who gave her a hairpin with ninja spider magic, and viola, monster movie.  After they fight in monster form, the two men have a classic sword duel on the beach. Surprisingly, this was a very good scene.  It could have been out of a straight samurai drama.  Not surprising, because Hiroki Matsukata, who played Ikazuchimaru, went on to become a very well-known actor.

For nostalgia purposes, this was a great watch, but now I'd really like to see the film in the original Japanese.

The other movie in this two pack is Return of the Giant Monsters, aka Gamera vs Gaos.  Construction on a national highway awakens prehistoric monster Gaos, named by a boy who was saved from the monster by Gamera. Gaos feeds on human blood and can't stand sunlight, sort of a Jurassic vampire bird.  The adults, getting ideas based on the boy's comments, create synthetic blood and lure Gaos to a turntable type thing converted from a revolving building. In the ned, Gamera comes in and saves the day.  I could say Kojiro Hongo, another actor who is known outside of monster movies was in this film, but he spent a lot of his early career in these type movies, including other Gamera films.  It's an okay Gamera film, but what's a Gamera film without the Gamera song, and this film doesn't have it.

The two pack's rating is all about the Magic Serpent, which is an hour and a half of nostalgic fun, a great combination of samurai and monsters.",1274486400,,2903,4.610894941634241
420991,4,6302069270,"GAMERA:Return of the Monsters(thanks amazon.com for fullfilling my purchase) would have gave it 5 Stars, though there was no widescreen(lame), Gamera(as well as Mothra) are to massive for crappy fullscreen,though the picture was clearer and the color looked(brighter) better than my thinsleeve copies.. We need this one in widescreen to have a more impressive collection..Hint dvd makers!!Stories are cool..Gamera does battle, with a giant vampire Bat!! a cool old time rubber suit slug fest..Gayos flying mode haha!!..looks like a model airplane modified to look like a giant bat..hmmm..very clever..

The show down at Dawn is cool..
Magic Serpent: WaYY!!! cool!! combination martial arts/ancient samura, Sword and Sorcerey fantasy Trip!!I loved it!! acting above average(subtitle dialogue,expressions) if i understood Japanese dialogue I bet it would be even better..The characters and monster designs above average in B+ monster genre the finale in this movie also is way cool and gives you an idea of where alot of other monster Ideas came from,.. these are the virgin concepts where a lot of others spin off thier monster stuff..

420992,5,6302069270,"Return of the Giant Monsters is the story about a boy being saved by Gamera the flying tortoise. Gamera saves the boy from the monster Gaos. Gaos is a flying vampire bat monster that lives on blood. He can also generate sonic laser-like beams, that can cut through most anything including Gamera's arm. Gamera drops Gaos into a volcano. Gaos dies supposedly. The magic serpent is a movie I have not yet seen, but it seems interesting. P Corti.",1238112000,,443,4.620253164556962
420993,4,6302069270,"Return of the Giant Monsters AKA Gamera vs Gaos is a really good Gamera movie. One of the best in the Show series actually.  In this Gamera fights the monster known as Gyaos,what a great monster design. He is like a Giant Bird with an Arsenio Hall head. He is Daiei's answer to Rodan from Toho. He shoots laser beams through his mouth which slices things. Some gory scenes(nothing offensive) like pink blood spurting  from Gyaos. Gamera was starting to become the protector of children & more of a good guy monster. The monster fights are insane in this move.
For the most part Retromedia's DVD isn't bad, - it has the superior AIP dubbing. It used to be on VHS from celebrity video with the Sandy Frank English dubbing. The Co-Feature of this DVD is The Magic Serpent is the  The monsters are cool,but their roars are of Godzilla Rodan & the Green Gargantua. In between the monster scenes which basically are the beginning and end of the film is a samurai fantasy tale of a man who learns to use his powers. It is an ok film, decent if anything at all.
Of course there are the original Japanese versions of the movie out there, Region 2 or something from Japan..but if you don't mind the English dubbed versions these films are still really enjoyable, especially Gamera vs Gyaos, one of the best 3 in the series from the 1960s.
As far as USA DVD's the one to get is from Retromedia at least at this point when the review was written",1230681600,,1433,4.420454545454546
420994,5,6302069270,"Return of the Giant Monsters is one of the best in the Showa films of Gamera (Possibly THE best). Although riffed on MST3K, it's still a good movie and as a bonus we get the original AIP version that we all grew up watching on the Creature Double Feature show on Saturday mornings (Not the dreadful Sandy Frank version released in the 80's and was shown on MST3K). Gyaos (Not Gaos but you pronounce it that way) is Gamera's King Ghidorah meaning he's the turtle's most popular and evil foe. Gyaos is a dangerous foe for Gamera to defeat since he can fire a beam that can slice things in half and can regenerate body parts. He also flies quicker than Gamera so it's difficult for him to catch up. The kid really didn't annoy me much so he's not much of a pest. Now onto the second feature which you may have never heard of until now but I don't blame you, The Magic Serpent! It's probably the wackiest and craziest kaiju film you'll ever see. We get monsters, ninjas, samurai, flying heads and the rest you'll have to discover on your own cause I don't want to spoil it for you. The quality for both films is similar to Retro Media's previous disc, Gamera vs. Monster X/Monster From a Prehistoric Planet. Colors are washed out and when it's dark it's hard to make out details. The extra is the same. Just info about the Retro Media Website. Though the audio is good. All in all, two very fun kaiju films from the 60's are worth adding to your collection.",1214438400,,1453,4.365313653136531
420995,5,6302069270,"I'm glad to see those movies in not the best quality. It's the way I seen them as a kid. When you see a remasterd copy of these kaiju films, you could see how fake the effects are. I think sometime it's best to leave things the way they are nostaigic.

420996,5,6302069270,"Like alot of other people in there late 30s early 40s, I remember seeing ""Return Of The Giant Monsters"" on the 4:30 movie a few times in the 1970s. This film was originally released during Kaijus golden years in Japan on March 15th,1967. This movie is far out there and really wild.  Even though there are miniatures and rubber suits used, Gaos was a well desighned monster and really an evil one. I must admit as a kid watching ""Return Of The Giant Monsters"" I really felt the evil of Gaos. As a child I cheered like hell for Gamera to kick this vampire bats backside. There is a moral story with this movie about over land development, kind of the trend in 1960s Godzilla movies at the time. As Gaos kicks the big Gs but in the beginning of the film, Gamera the giant turtle saves the day, Gamera demolishes Gaos at the end when we see pink blood spurting from Gaos. This film was out there and really my favorite out of all the Gamera movies. Miniatures and rubber suits aside, ""Return of the Giant Monsters"" is a well thought out low budget production. I really feel ""Return of the Giant Monsters"" was a well done, very creative monster movie, despite very limited special effects. The musical score in this movie by classical musical composer Tadashi Yamauchi, is incredible and really goes with the movie well, and has stayed with me well after I saw this movie 30+ years ago. I don't know what it is, but people like myself that are in there late 30s, early 40s kind of like watching people in rubber suits destroying fake cites. I guess it was the in thing for children, teenagers, at the time in the mid 1970s, remember these movies were watched before Star Wars revolutionized sci-fi movies forever in 1977. The 16mm print transferred to dvd is not a great print, but is alot better than what we saw on tv in the 1970s. Operation Whirlybird and sythetic human blood translates to alot of fun, you may have out grown  ""Return of the Giant Monsters"" but it is still alot of fun to watch...............",1179360000,,2009,4.4863387978142075
