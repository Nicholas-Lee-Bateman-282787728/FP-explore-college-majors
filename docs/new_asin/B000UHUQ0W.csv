I am shocked that there are strong negative reviews of this product. It has changed my life, along with the rest of the subliminal manifestation series. Don't listen to the haters, you will miss out if you don't buy this dvd!",1304899200,,238,4.558139534883721

The product did not work with my DVD player. It's DVD-R technology and is known to not work with every player.

Since it did not work I took advantage of the return option the company offers. It took them more than a week after getting the DVD back to confirm they did get it and apply the refund to my account. The day after I get the email confirming the refund I get the following email from Mark J. Ryan:

  ""I figured you would do what you did..you can just feel the energy from certain people right away

  So predictable!""

Amazing....

I'm a big fan of Dr. Vitale but this experience makes me rethink that trust.",1301270400,,708,4.33587786259542
8213330,1,B000UHUQ0W,"Please people don't waste your money on these subliminal recordings and tapes they don't work!!! I have taken many, many psychology classes since I am working on and have almost completed my BA in psychology. Subliminal ads that the stores run have a very minor effect, but the tapes and recordings have absolutely no effect whatsoever and this has been proven scientifically. These people are scam artists and are out for a fast buck nothing else. If anyone actually says that the product has worked then it is nothing more than their own mind and a little positive thought that has turned things around it is like a placebo effect with the recording being the sugar pill. These tapes make outrageous claims like heal cancer, weight loss, no more fear, and many other outlandish claims my point is don't waste your money. If you want to improve yourself and have issues go see a counselor, you want to take off some weight do it with a diet not a tape there is no quick solution to weight loss. Life is hard and there is no easy way around it period. Just don't waste your money on a pile of crud like this.",1269302400,,1108,4.49009900990099
