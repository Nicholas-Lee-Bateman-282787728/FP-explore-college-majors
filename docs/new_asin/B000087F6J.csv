7979786,3,B000087F6J,It has some decent features it's really a show movie no real races except a couple scenes but has lots of show coverage and the models aren't bad either.  Decent video if your into the show scene.,1075248000,,196,4.297297297297297
7979787,1,B000087F6J,"I dunno what the guy below me is smoking but this video sucked. It is filled with a bunch of interviews and stupid interludes and not nearly enough car footage. It just drags on for an hour and a half and doesn't show anything worth the money I spent on it. Unfortunatley most other import racing videos aren't much better. But the street fury series, midnight street racing, and redline are way better than this.",1074988800,2,413,4.52
7979788,5,B000087F6J,"I've been into the sport compact car scene for years, and have been reading all the magazines, watching all the videos, and now, watching the TV shows. I have to say, this is the best out there. Its better than all of the other videos, combined. If you want to save money, forget all the other videos, and just get this one!!!! 360 Video rox!!!!!",1055376000,,346,4.338461538461538
