I found this story intriguing because it involves historical individuals (although some artistic license was taken, no doubt).  Nevertheless, the other actors contributed well to their parts and Joan, of course, never disappoints, always revealing her goodness despite the circumstances.",1494547200,,387,5.327868852459017

Sally Marris (Joan Leslie) is arriving in Border City just at the end of the Civil War. The town isn't near as wild as one would expect since the mayor, Delilah Courtney, runs it with an iron fist. The owner of the nearby lead mine, Delilah refuses to allow anyone in to town wearing their guns be it the soldiers from the nearby fort or the mercenaries in the employ of marauder Charles Quantrill (Brian Donlevy). On her trip into town, Sally finds her stage overrun by Quantrills band of men where she meets Cole Younger and a young Jesse James.

Once she enters town Sally seeks out her brother only to find that he runs a local saloon and brothel. Not only that, she learns that he was heartbroken not long ago when the woman he intended to marry, Kate (Audrey Totter), was kidnapped by Quantrill who then forced her to marry him. She now holds a grudge against Sallys brother and does nothing more than start trouble when she enters his saloon. This eventually leads to his being shot in a gunfight, leaving Sally behind to discover that he was deep in debt which is now on her.

When she appeals to the ladies of the town led by the mayor she discovers that they only think of her as a floozy due to her brothers business rather than the prim and proper lady she actually is. With nowhere to go and no one to turn to she has little choice but to keep the saloon open and run it just as her brother had before. This isn't an easy task since Kate holds a grudge against Sally.

Alongside this story is that of an undercover agent for Quantrill, Lance Horton (Jon Lund), who is posing as the foreman for the lead mine. This is the same man responsible for shooting Sallys brother. He now feels he owes a debt to Sally and does everything he can to help her. At the same time Quantrill is pushing Lance to deliver a load of stolen lead to be used to make bullets for his raiders.

Before the end of the film at least one if not both of the female leads will be in line for the hangmans noose, thus the films title. The fighting will go one, the Civil War will end and the townspeople just might come to think more highly of Sally than they originally did. And what of Kate, Quantrill, Younger and the James brothers? Well, I think history has shown what became of them and their ends are not a part of this film. Its a low budget western that shows the best of what they had to offer short of a singing cowboy. Had that been included it would have had it all. As it stands it offers a nice entertainment of the sort seen only in the past. Thank goodness movies like this are being preserved.",1428537600,4,2834,4.260223048327138
8689388,4,B00PUZ4R5O,"Excellent unknown western. Very unusual. Original all the way. Brian Donlevy and Audrey Totter are both very good and so is Joan Leslie. My Blu Ray print was suburb. Highly recommended,

8689389,5,B00PUZ4R5O,"This is an underrated little Western, starring Brian Donlevy, John Lund, and Audrey Totter. Somewhat off the beaten track of the normal Hollywood oater plot, nevertheless, it maintains interest throughout. Good acting helps make this an enjoyable romp. Good black and white filrm transfer add to the enjoyment. Recommended.",1424563200,5,323,5.612244897959184
