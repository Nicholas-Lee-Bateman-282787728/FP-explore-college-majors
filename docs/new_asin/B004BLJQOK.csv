4319142,4,B004BLJQOK,"If I had not seen the original version, Let the Right One In, from Sweden about a year ago, I probably would have given this top notch remake 5 stars. The dark script and characters are still fantastic this time around, but it's almost an exact copy of the one that came before. The last horror film I remember that followed almost scene for scene from the source material was Psycho, and we all know how that turned out. At first I was trying to think of a reason why they would remake an already good/great movie so soon, but I guess they thought most audiences in the U.S. wouldn't want to read the subtitles that the foreign version had to offer.

The story involves a 12-year-old vampire girl who befriends a neighbor boy, while her loving ""father"" has to kill people and bring home blood for her survival.

Chloe Moretz is even more impressive here than in her breakout role as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. There is just something hypnotic about her acting. When she is on screen, your eyes are transfixed. I can see a Jodie Foster like career for her, if she doesn't go the Lohan way. Kodi Smit-McPhee was up to the challenge as well. They share some great chemistry. You rarely see one good child actor performance in a movie, let alone two. Richard Jenkins didn't have a major role as the father figure of the vampire girl, but he fit the mold nicely.

I liked the atmosphere and creepy visuals even more in this version. The kills were also more quick, brutal and bloody. Some people seem to be complaining about the CGI (which isn't used much anyway), like when the vampire climbs up a tree, but I hardly noticed. The music was okay, but could have been more memorable. I liked the way Blue Oyster Cult's ""Burnin' For You"" and The Greg Kihn Band's ""The Breakup Song"" were put to use.

Let Me In is easily one of the top five films I've seen this year. I think you will enjoy it more if you don't see the original first, but they are both equally great (maybe a slight edge to this one, especially if you don't want to read), so I'll let you decide. You're welcome.",1285977600,10,2068,4.391644908616188
4319143,4,B004BLJQOK,"Let the Right One In  was one of the most talked about films of 2008. Even outside the horror community, critics and moviegoers alike were raving how the film breathed new life into the tired vampire genre. While the Swedish film certainly had its moments and told a pretty amazing story, it wasn't quite as exceptional as everyone made it out to be. When word came that Cloverfield director Matt Reeves  would be remaking the film for American audiences, there was a massive amount of skepticism. You've probably heard the complaints about remakes before. How they're never as good as the original and are only done to make a quick buck. Well Hollywood may have pulled a fast one on you and is set to release a remake that's actually worth seeing for once.

The trickiest part when handling a remake like this is what the writers, directors, and anyone else behind the scenes decide to change in comparison to the original film. If they change too much then people complain that it strayed too far from the original, but if they change too little then people claim it's too similar to the original and that it was pointless to remake in the first place. They've got to find a balance; add just the right amount of different and new material while maintaining a film that follows in the same footsteps of whatever it was based on. Let Me In just does that.

Let Me In is actually at its strongest during the scenes where it ventures away from the 2008 film. Just about any scene that takes place in a car is spectacular, especially during one particular scene where things don't go exactly as planned. There's also a scene where Abby attacks a jogger in a tunnel that's pretty brutal. These added scenes didn't take anything away from the already well-established story, but actually managed to add depth to these characters a good portion of the people seeing this are already familiar with. Considering most Hollywood remakes, this is well worth mentioning. Let Me In at least deserves credit for pulling off something like that.

There are several alterations to the story that may put off some who were Let the Right One In enthusiasts. Oskar and Eli are now Owen and Abby and the film now takes place in New Mexico rather than Stockholm. Some of the more memorable scenes in the film didn't make quite as much of an impact as they did in Let the Right One In. Virginia being exposed to sunlight and the pool scene at the end of the film being the two biggest examples. It's not that those particular scenes weren't done well, but they just felt too similar or maybe weren't quite different enough to distinguish them in comparison to the original. That's probably my biggest complaint with the film overall. If you've seen Let the Right One In, then you know how everything turns out. That's a pretty obvious statement dealing with a remake, but knowing that going in really seemed to hurt the experience overall.

Let Me In definitely deserves to be held in high regard as one of the best horror remakes in recent years and perhaps ever. Its newly added material blends in nicely into an already well-written vampire story. It just felt like the film could have been even stronger if it was a bit more unpredictable. Nevertheless, its wonderful cast, enticing storyline, and eye-catching camera work will satisfy just about any moviegoer and is a surprisingly strong horror film to be released this late in the year.",1285891200,8,3422,4.676079734219269
4319144,5,B004BLJQOK,"I've seen the original LET THE RIGHT ONE IN several times and it never fails to leave me uneasy, an other worldly masterpiece of  film making excellence. Everything about this was just about perfect. Much like the book, full of character studies and a slow paced winter dream. Having watched the new remake LET ME IN, I still can say this also is a wonderful journey into a macabre story that takes hold and never lets up. Closely following the original but with a bolder choice of settings, music and actors, LET ME IN will take you under its spell, its beautifully filmed, a love story of some sorts but a terrifying tale. This film takes out much of the ""other"" plots in the book and original and focuses all the energy on the young troubled boy and the girl and her caretaker that moves next door. Can't leave out the wonderful police detective as well!  I felt the acting and unusual story  make this remake a step above your usual vampire lore but I still will never get the original out of my head. One quirk that should have been much better was the special effects of the vampire but that is its only flaw.  Both of these gems have their own special creep factor and cinematography chill and  should both be scene for what the directors have created.  All the acting put this one way over the top in quality, a classic on my movie shelf.",1283817600,3,1346,4.407258064516129
4319145,1,B004BLJQOK,"10/23/2010 Update;
I've read every critics review I could find on this film.  I bought into the hype and went to see it. I stand by my original assesment based on viewing only the trailer. There is no conceivable way (and I will argue this point to the ends of the Earth, try me) that Reeves' film is better than the original--as some critics claim. He lifted the color palette, the tone, a number of key shots, dialogue, etc. from the original film. That doesn't constitute a better film. It's like plagiarizing an essay. You take an original, obscure source. You take all of it's original ideas and principles and you twist them around and reorganize and restructure them to fit your purpose. People may marvel at your ""fresh take on the original source material"", but it's certainly no masterpiece. Case in point: The pool scene. Easily the most memorable scene from the original film. Reeves sets the whole thing up quite well, but when it comes to the execution he falls short. Throwing about 50 more gallons of blood in that pool and making the one kid cross diagonally behind Owen and having a decapitated head fall down in front of his face came off hokey and lame. And that's just my point: if the point was stand off and away from the original film, why is so much blatantly ripped off from it? Why do you have essentially the same shot in the pool scene only changed by about a 45 degree camera angle? It seems he didn't make his own adaptation of the novel, but rather tweaked a screenplay to mediocre results. Don't get me started on the acting by the two leads. I had high hopes for Chole Moretz--what a disappointment! There was not one moment of her performance when I did not know she was just regurgitating a memorized script. And Kodi Smit-Mcphee, OH. MY. GOD! Could his performance have been any worse?  It was like they dubbed his voice with the english dubbing from the original movie. No emotion, no depth, no nothing. If you do not know what I mean.  Watch just a few minutes of the original movie with english dubbing and you will see.

This remake is just another example of why the original is a masterpiece, and a genuine work of art that deserves ALL of the
praise it has gotten. Especially praise of the two lead actors--
Lina Leandersson and Kre Hedebrant. The film's director, Tomas Alfredson, took his time in
finding the two young actors (incredibly, their first time on screen) and
their performances are magnificent, heart-wrenching and totally believable!

I give the remake zero stars.  Yes, that is correct, ZERO! ""What an idiot. You gave it one star"".  Only because Amazon FORCES me to chose from 1-5 stars. But thanks for your comments.

My original review is below:

Let me be the first to give this remake zero stars.  I just saw the first trailer which was recently released.
From WHAT THEY SHOW in the trailer, it is identical to the Five Star original--""Lat den ratte komma in"" (Let the Right One In)
Do your self a favor, check out the reviews for the original and then watch it!
I am curious to see Chole Moretz as Eli or whatever the vampires name is in the remake.  Her role as Hit Girl in Kick Ass was superb.  Unfortunately, Kodi Smit-Mcphee is playing Oskar.  My first exposure to Kodi was his role in ""The Road"".  I was not impressed.  In fact it was some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Too bad, there must have been someone else they could have chosen.
Oh well, I'll probably see the remake at some point just to satisfy my curiosity. However, I am determined to despise it.",1282867200,17,3534,4.525902668759811
4319146,4,B004BLJQOK,"Ive been on a vampire kick recently, checking out different movies and how they effect the genre.  I have to say this one in particular has a very powerful way to present the story and how a vampire achieves the loyalty of a mortal, human thrall.  A thrall is a slave to the vampire in whom he does most of the business on the vampires behalf.  In Salems Lot, Straker was Barlows thrall, he simply made sure Barlow was set for getting his needs fulfilled.  I had always seen these human slaves in several vampire flicks, but I never saw just HOW they became thralls.  Until this movie, Let Me In.

The movie was quite thrilling and had some good scares. But it was also a great drama of an out of place boy who has some murderous tendencies due to how he he is treated at school, and how he is ignored by divorcing parents.  And then he meets his new neighbor Abby, and an interesting, strange attraction occurs.  We find out how vicious the sweet little girl can be, and how her thirst changes her.  But we also see that her current thrall is losing his abilities to care for her, and he sees that he is expendable now that she is creating this relationship with Owen, the boy next door.  It is fascinating how in the end, the girl gets the boy.

Highly recommended!  Though this would have made a better series for Showtime or HBO, to develop the characters more, and to see where this story goes.",1520035200,,1399,4.318007662835249

4319151,4,B004BLJQOK,"(Minor Spoilers) Here we have a somewhat atypical horror film in that the two main characters are preteens, one a mortal human (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and, oh yeah, the other a vampire (Chloe Grace Moretz), living at the same middle-class apartment complex...in New Mexico!  The favorable reviews I've seen are mostly deserving, yet the film wasn't quite as scary as advertised in terms of shocks and suspense, with some predictable elements and the special-effects sequences being noticeably weak.  But, interestingly, the viewer gets to see a kinder, gentler side to vampires, to the point where you may find yourself caring or rooting for them.  It's not quite ""The best American horror film in the last 20 years,"" like Stephen King apparently said (I actually found ""Daybreakers,"" another vampire flick, at least as compelling, though that's not to mean that I dwell in this genre), but the upper-level acting, the timely anti-bullying message, and the film being set in the 1980s, including the music, were clear-cut positives!

It also - without getting too wrapped up in long conversations or philosophy - delved into what is it to be good and what is it to be evil.

4319156,4,B004BLJQOK,"There are numerous, good, concise reviews of this movie and story available if that is what you seek.  But, I thought I might give some background, in hopes of providing something new to the conversation.  This is a vampire, light-horror film that is an American remake of a fairly successful Swedish film, Let The Right One In, which was based on the Swedish book of the same (English) name.  To enjoy the film you need mild horror inclination, or at least tolerance.  For understanding the remake, it is helpful I think to know a little about the original which I give five stars, not because it was that good of a movie per se, but rather for the innovation it shows.  Vampires have been portrayed from what would seem to be every possible angle, yet this story provides a new twist, something hard to imagine possible.  So, I would encourage anyone to experience the story if for no other reason than the innovation.  To their credit, the Americans were driven to the remake out of admiration for the original rather than a crass attempt to capitalize on the success of others.  Points for that.  If you aren't inclined to experience the story in any other way, then this remake is worth a watch, simply for the imagination the story shows.  That said, if you are willing, stick to the original.  On the surface, this story is not ambiguous so is not frustrating to the casual viewer.  A layer down however, the story lends itself to much interpretation.  In other words, it is difficult to relate the story without some level of personal spin which might be right, might be wrong, whos to know?  The masterfulness of the original is that it leaves more of this to the story listener, not the teller.  The subtle biases of interpretation bleed into the American version which makes it a watch once and forget movie.  The original, however, might leave you pondering things for years to come.  Such a great story then just read the book?  Actually, I thought this was one of the very rare instances where the film adaptations were better than the book.  The book tended to ramble, had many incoherent scenes, and made it hard to develop any real conclusions about the story.  Like good abridgers, the filmmakers took the best ideas and scenes from the book and produced a tighter story that let you ponder things more than just leave you confused.  Part of this, there is a twist in book, barely touched on in the movies, that changes everything, not for the better I didn't think.  If you are a Steven King fan, then you might enjoy the book as it is written in his style. Otherwise, as noted, I am almost ashamed to say, watch the movies, don't read the book.",1508544000,3,2664,4.575949367088608

It has a very unique twist on the vampire genre without depending on all the gore. There are some chilling scenes but not from graphic/shock videography. The leading female, Chloe Moretz, did a spectacular job of making you sympathize with her situation and Kodi Smit-McPhee makes you wonder why you didn't learn Morse Code when you were in junior high school.

4319172,5,B004BLJQOK,"Maybe its a controversial (or at least rare) opinion, but I can't choose a favorite between this film and the Swedish original Let the Right One In.  Both are powerful and beautiful in their own way.  Also really liked the book these films were based on, which got me into the work of Swedish horror writer John Ajvide Lindqvist.  Also got me into the music of Morrissey and The Smiths - basically I'm trying to say a lot of good things have come into my life thanks to this ""franchise"" :)

I guess its just a story that really speaks to me, no matter what form its told in.  I think we all have stories that speak to us primally that way.  I think what really drew me to the story was relating so much to main character Owen (even though, at 40, I'm much older than he, haha).  I think anyone who's been bullied should be able to relate to him pretty easily.  Feeling different from others, wanting revenge on the bullies, falling for the first person who seems like they can rescue/save him from that fate (if only I'd had someone in my life like Abby!).  I really fell (platonically) for Abby.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1446,4.378277153558052

I still gave it 4 stars since it was almost an exact replica of the original - and while that normally turns me off - they did this quite well. Considering what passes for horror these days, this is a gem. However, if you want a truly creepy experience you must check out the original from Sweden. ""Let The Right One In"" is in my top 10 list of all-time great horror films and it is a 5 star movie. But if you are here looking for a worthy Horror/Suspense movie that is still sufficiently creepy and twisted then get some popcorn now because once you start watching ""Let Me In"" you won't be able to stop.

4319218,3,B004BLJQOK,"Writing reviews can be such a self-indulgent venture. Especially when a review centers around sharing our feelings about a work, as if that alone makes our opinion by default right for everyone. Having read the book and seen the Swedish film adaptation. I think I can offer more than that though. With the opening credits to this film stating that this movie is based off of both the novel and the Swedish film adaptation of the book, I can see how true that statement is. There are details in this film that are in the book, but not the original movie. As well as shared details that were in the original movie, but not the book. Also, if you watch the extras you see the director explain why it takes place in a wintery New Mexico. If you have read the book you will realize it is meant to be a parallel of an atmospheric detail in the written work, but never mentioned in the original movie. Not that you can discern that by watching this movie alone. Without the additional info offered in the extras it just seems like an out of place element. I guess the first release of the English translation of the book Let the Right One In, was sold under the title Let Me In, in the states. Which explains the title variation. Since the significance of the original title is left out of this film, I guess it makes sense to use it, even if it is a lame title. Many details of the original book get compressed in this American film. There was a religious person in the book, but it was not the mother. There were alcoholics in the book, but none were the mother either. Of course, if you have read the book, you realize, there is a whole other side to the story that has been completely written out of the American version. While it is in the Swedish film, but it is put in so subtly that it is easy to miss. If you have not read the book first, you probably would not even recognize those details for what they were; I know I did not. I had to re watch the films after finishing the book to realize that. With all that being said, I am glad I saw this film first, so I could enjoy it for what it is, rather dismiss it for what it is not. I really did like what Chloe Moretz did with the part. However, I did find the removal of the male leads morbid curiosity a bit misguided. I am sure it would have worked much better if they had left that detail intact.",1462579200,,2352,4.182819383259912

""I saw the Swedish original LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, looked at briefly thereafter from the remake LMI to experience and it to the comparison. The differences are simply enormous, although about 85% of the scenes are almost identical.
First + the positive:
a) for already 3 years I am a giant fan of Chloe Moretz and expect only large acts of her. It plays also here very well, approaches however not to the radiant emittance of Lina Leandersson as vampire Maid Eli in LTROI.
b) compared to other verhunzten remakes is this here completely acceptably.

BUT: Let the right one in (LTROI) is superior to that remake LMI in ANY REGARD. Not, because that is already original by SE better and better, but:
1. Swedish in language + mentality + landscape in the original contributes naturally also to the singularly melancholy tendency of the film. Further highly to praise the unbelievably great music score is with LTROI, which never FORCES ITSELF upon, like much too often in other films. And thus this Score supports just the atmosphere simply magnificent (in remake LMI is missing this completely - bad!)

2. further gives it during that about 110 min. with LTROI several settings and scenes to see, which I am about never forgotten. Not least owing to the virtuoso camera and picture language, which pleased me extremely well, anyhow better than with LMI. For instance the original scenes were turned in the winter with up to -30 degrees in north Sweden - and thus they work also many more genuinly than naturally more economical cgi fake FX from the new Mexico USA of the remake LMI. (e.g. see the smoke swaths when breathing out in cold weather)

3. the 2 main figures in the original are drawn for Eli better, have actually (!!!) more intelligent dialogues (the dialogues between the two US-kids approximately in remake LMI are something like that from flat, really hardly seize one, why?!) between Oskar + come much more at feelings over and them affect me also much more, than this is with Owen + Chloe the case. Their played affection appears to me unfortunately soulless and false.
The integrated coming off age part with first love/affection is told with LTROI in such marvelous picture language and a tardiness that it was really a true benefit for me. Nothing works here fakes or specially designed. Oskar and Eli and let me sympathize emotional so much with them. The LMI version sacrifices this in favor of superficial and superficial effects.

4. because besides some the best scenes from that original LTROI was painted strange to say in remake LMI. Why the vulture knows.

All in all LTROI creates so almost impossible splits between cruelty and tenderness, and this is high art.

Let me in - against it only exciting entertainment cinema with some shock elements supplies. (= approx. 3 - 4 stars) however probably just perfectly sufficiently for the less demanding US-mainstream-audience and Stephen King.""

4319247,3,B004BLJQOK,"I feel compelled to write a review having been recently infected by the story ""Let The Right One In."" So, to be sure, there was a story, and that story was adapted into a movie by the same name, by the very same author. That film was used as an inspiration for this film. The premise is familiar, but the tone is quite different. I enjoyed this film, but it is in no way superior to the book or previous film. This adaptation plays out more like a horror story, as opposed to the former which is more like a coming of age lovestory between two people who arw fundamentally out of synch with world around them, but find comfort in eachother. The tone in this movie is different, and there's the other issue, where since the original screenplay was written by the author, there was a lot of detail that was left out, but the stuff left in was easy to grasp, especially if you'd read the book. This version was exclusively made from the original film, with barely a nod to the text. In particular, there are distinct motivations between Abbey and Eli. The films implies s dresry existence for Owen going along with Abbey, whereas Eli and Oskar are two kindred spirits who've found eachother and gladly take their exit of cruel and cold world. Oskar isn't Eli's minder, but rather he is her equal, (in a manner of speaking). If you read the book (highly reccomended) then go ahead and check out the sequel, Let The Old Dreams Die, and that sheds plenty of light on the fate of our protagonists. Both U.S. and Swedish films are similarly, and they are almost inverted inbevery sense if the word. Personally, I prefer the Swedish film, but I guess being an American raised on paranormal horror and sci-fi, I can say that I found this movie enjoyable to watch, but by far, way inferior to the story and original release. And for those of you who also find yourselves infected, there is word an A&E series adaptation is in the works. READ THE BOOK S!",1446508800,,1942,4.442577030812325

Excellent exploration of the sad, desperate, lonely lives of a young boy, Owen, a young vampire, Abby, and her serial-killer ""father"" who is ""...tired of all this""!  This movie explores the very nature of relationships: one very demanding relationship/lifestyle that has reached its inevitable conclusion (""Home in the darkness; Home on the highway; Home isn't my way; Ain't no home for me; I'm burning, I'm burning, I'm burning for you"") and one new budding relationship with an unknown future (""They just don't write 'em like that anymore"").  Bully begets bully, vampire begets vampire, but does love beget love?  I believe Abby has unexpectedly found romantic love for the first time with Owen and she is not just using him as she has done with so many before.

The ending pays homage to ""The Graduate"" with an open question about Owen and Abby's future together.  Will Owen ask Abby to turn him so that he can be strong and they can be together forever in an un-dead vampire state, just as Romeo & Juliet are together forever in death?  Or will Owen & Abby's relationship be doomed when Owen grows older and becomes tired of Abby's very demanding lifestyle?

The child actors in it are perfect, especially the girl whose voice they dubbed so as to appear more fittingly androgynous (and this was done perfectly). She also looked more haunting. In ""Let Me In,"" first, there are two sound cut-outs in the disk. Second, the child actors are not as good, and I generally like Chloe Grace Moretz's acting ability. Third, The vampire attack scenes were CGI-enhanced and looked fake. There was no buildup in the story line of most of the victims, whereas in the Swedish original and in the book, you had some sense of these characters beforehand. Finally, the music in the film was ludicrous...generic, old-school. How Rotten Tomatoes rated this movie 88% is beyond me. Don't buy this; rather, buy the blu ray version of ""Let The Right One In."" . If you prefer, you can switch the audio to English, but I always prefer the original language of any movie.

4319262,5,B004BLJQOK,One of the most impressive horror films I've ever seen. So many levels of terror. It will make you go to places in your mind you never been to before and linger in your thoughts long after the film is over. It does leave you with a sense of justice in one way but then you soon realize the cycle of terror hasn't ended it has just begun again. This is one powerful film.,1441324800,,370,4.013513513513513
4319263,5,B004BLJQOK,"For some reason, there seem to be a LOT of really good young directors coming up in the horror field just in time to replace the late-lamented Wes Craven and his generation: Adam Green (""Frozen,"" ""Digging Up the Marrow""), Adam Wingard (""You're Next""), Matt Baer (""Maggie"") and David R. Mitchell (""It Follows"").  But in some ways Matt Reeves has topped then all with this one, at least in part because he was able to get marvelous performances from two adolescent actors, Cody Smit McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz, for the two main roles of Owen and Abby.  As far as I was concerned, Chloe had already won her wings as a 12-year-old package of trouble in ""Kick-ass"" and as a startlingly different take on ""Carrie"" in the remake of that movie, but Smit-McPhee was an unexpected find.  Being Swedish-American, I'd already read John Arvide Lindqvist's novel and saw the Swedish language version of the movie, and I would have sworn that you couldn't transfer it into an American milieu.  But they did, and it succeeds.  As other reviewers have noted, the most vitriolic critics in some cases don't even seem to have seen Reeves's film, instead copying each other's Cliff Notes on why it isn't up to the original (and believe me, I'm usually no fan of re-makes, after seeing how the remakes butchered ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street."")  But this one touched me in a way they usually don't, in that you're sympathetic to the bullied kid who finds a friend to help him strike back, the friend, who herself is trapped in a cage of immortal pain that she can't get out of without final death, the father-figure who has to kill for her so she can keep ""living,"" the Serb teacher who has enough pain in  his own past to empathize with the kids but knows what Abby is, and the harried policeman who is just trying to bring killers to justice.  Add, on top of that, a sub-plot about school bullying, currently a hot issue,,and it's hard to hate any of them - they're people caught in one of the worst of traps.  This never comes through better than in the scenes between Owen and Abby, who seem to have gone off to a world of their own as adolescents sometimes do, one where they not only can't be understood by adults, they can't be stopped before it all goes too far wrong to fix,and you know that major characters you have grown fond of are going to die.  It's going to take me a while to digest all the implications of this one, but wowser, what a train ride!  A further plus for this edition is the extras, which include a ""making of"" film (in which Chloe charmingly confesses that sometimes she gets scared by watching her own characters) and some deleted scenes, at least one of which (between Abby and Owen) should probably have been left in.
  Conclusion: this is much better than a lot of the critics assumed (but then again, almost every major horror movie in the past fifty years has been initially panned by critics).  Now if they'll just put out a decent CD or Blue-Ray version of the Swedish original so people can see them side by side and make their own judgments. . .",1440892800,,3098,4.518783542039356

I think I would have enjoyed it more if they spent more time developing the friendship / girlfriend relationship with the vampire. It seemed like the ending wrapped up too quickly like just copying the first movie. It would have also been nice to see more ""mayhem"" against school bullies. They could have developed that motif further as well as give the audience more psychological reasons why the young boy would go off to a new life with his vampire in tow.

And when he asks her how old she is, she replies ""12... but I've been 12 for a very long time"".

It is a wonderful ""prepubescent"" Twilight movie minus the sparkly vampires. A vampire movie however is a stretch as there was no real ""jump out of your seat moments."" It is basically a story of two social outcast who find comfort and solace in each other...and that is fine. That story line could have survived on its own sans the vampire theme. The story is a sweet one of longing, acceptance and loyalty again vampires did not need to be added into the mix.

4319339,3,B004BLJQOK,"If you haven't seen the original and like vampire movies, it's well worth watching.

For those wondering how it compares to the Swedish version:
- All the shots look a lot sharper. Depending on your taste this could be good or bad, I personally preferred the hazier look
- The violence was amplified
- The vampire scenes were much more elaborate and clearly depicted
- Explains the background story in much more detail

It's a matter of taste. I feel like the ""Americanized"" version thinks audiences need to be shown things a lot clearer, with more details, better special effects, and top notch cameras. To me, that dumbs the movie down a little and dilutes the atmosphere. The original was slower, but it wasn't trying to make a Vampire thriller, it was about the relationship between the two main characters.

If you like slower paced, more thoughtful movies and don't mind subtitles, check out Let The Right One In. If you like faster paced, scary movies, you'll probably enjoy this one.",1419206400,14,991,4.783625730994152

4319351,5,B004BLJQOK,"Owen was a young boy. He was completely alone. His mom was alive, but was not raising him. He was often attacked by other kids - not bullied, attacked. They terrorized him, and caused intense pain. He'd never had a friend, and was horribly neglected. Despite that he still had his heart intact.

His life changed when new neighbors moved into the apartment building. A man and girl about Owen's age. The man wasn't actually Abby's dad, he was her care taker and guardian.

Abby and Owen grew closer throughout the film. Their relationship was the simplicity of young love. They shared a love of puzzles and music. His face lit up when she accepted a gift from him. They danced together. She gave Owen his first kiss. He treasured her smile. She listened to him, and encouraged him to hit back. She had strength to spare, and wanted him to have it

Abby was mysterious from the start. Eventually Owen learned Abby's secret. She was a vampire. How old The Vampire was isn't clear. Physically, emotionally and mentally every part of her that was human was still a child. Abby was a 12 year old girl, and would be that way for her indefinate existence. Owen was scared of her, and protective at the same time.

At the climax Owen was cornered by his tormentors, at a pool. Their leader was ready to either drown Owen or knife him. Owen was underwater and helpless. Then Abby appeared. She came for Owen, like an Avenging Angel. His attackers had become her prey.

At the very end Owen was on a train, with Abby inside a large wooden trunk. Some of Owen's future was left to the imagination. 40 years later would he be pretending to be Abby's father? Or would she turn him? What was clear, beyond any doubt, was Owen would/could never leave her. He was passed the point where he could live without her. Human or Vampire Owen would be with Abby for the rest of his life, and he would do anything to keep her safe and alive.",1415750400,,1917,4.45014245014245

As expected, Moretz turned out a phenomenal performance, but the other acting talent did as well, including Kodi Smit-McPhee, whom I had never heard of before watching this film.  There were some slight changes from the traditional vampire myths, but nothing like that garbage that was in the waste of time and energy that is the Twilight books and movies.

4319360,4,B004BLJQOK,"I rented this in order to compare it to the original. Let Me In is essentially the same movie as the original Let The Right One In - except for a few exceptions, it is almost a shot for shot remake of the original. The exceptions almost make for a better movie: The opening scene is new, and the scenes the director left out, dealing with the villagers in the original, make for a cleaner, more streamlined story. The only new footage is a car wreck, and scenes involving the character of a police detective who fulfills the roles of the missing villagers in the original. One shot was either missing or blanked out in the rental video - where the hero peeks in the bedroom to see the vampire girl changing her clothes. In the original, there is a very brief glimpse which suggests that the vampire is actually a eunuch (which explains her telling Oscar throughout the movie that she is not a girl) but in this version the boy peeks in the room and there is simply a flash of white. I don't know if this was censored for public distribution, or if movie was made this way (in which case I have to wonder why the scene was even included). The major differences between the two movies is that Let Me In is lacking the alien quality the original had - at least to an American audience - since it is set in New Mexico instead of Sweden, and that the kids in the American version are less creepy than the ones in the Swedish version. Oskar, in the Swedish version, actually comes across creepier than the vampire girl.  My personal preference is to watch the original of this (as well as the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) because my grandfather was Swedish and it brings back pleasant memories to hear the language even though I can't understand very much of it. My recommendation is that you watch the original if you don't mind reading subtitles (or if you understand Swedish) but watch the remake if you are fond of Chlo Grace Moretz or don't like foreign films.",1413763200,,1968,4.421487603305785

4319381,3,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In

Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby) star in this horror film that did not really do a lot for me.

We meet the boy as a loser, involved with a family breaking apart.  The mom apparently is a religious person who forces her kid to pray.  The kid meantime steals from her purse to buy candy and sneaks out to play video games.  Yay, Pac Man!  Then he lies to his mom who asks if he was in the yard the whole time and he says he was.

He dreams of hurting the bullies (some real psychotic kids who can get away with anything and everything  so unrealistic) and uses his spare time playing peeping Tom with a telescope, checking out his neighbors while wearing a clear mask.

Why the mask?  Why the lying and introversion?  This is never explained.  Whats up with the mother and father?  Why the divorce?  Why is this kid so unsupportive and takes advantage of his mother through lying and stealing her money and disobeying her?  Never explained.

People and Plots:

Whats interesting is that just as he is using his mother, so the vampire is using young Owen.

For a centuries old (I assume) vampire, she is not that smart.  She forces a man to continue to supply blood, going from town to town harvesting people for her thirst.  Turns out (spoiler) he has been helping her for forty plus years when he was 12 falling for her.

Just as she is losing interest in him, so she meets Owen.

Just like Owen taking control her his mother, so she slowly takes control of him.

Insidious evil.  Nave child.

Bottom Line:

Hardly any development of plot  the cop looking for his Satanic cult and comes upon the vampires apartment without backup, without warrant busting down her door  the special effects of the vampire moving fast and killing were not interesting  the hospital where beds burn and nurses have no clue whats going on  it all adds up to a tame horror film.

And no, didn't read the book nor see the Swedish film this is based on.  Regardless of the author saying the film was good, I think it could have been better.  Could we have made the bullies less psychotic?  Could we have found out some kind, any kind of background of his family?  And how did the vampire get this way in the first place and not know anything of the current world she lives in?

We may never know.

DVD is interesting, with decent features and great Blu Ray and awesome sound.  Unfortunately does not save the film.

4319385,4,B004BLJQOK,"Matt Reeves did a very capable job with this, though I enjoyed the Swedish original more, as it had a smidgen more character. An excellent performance by Kodi Smit-McPhee (the young boy), whose torment came across very palpably. Some nice cinematography, too, although trumped again (albeit just slightly) by the Swedish offering. I haven't yet decided if this was a remake whose existence was necessary; it doesn't depart very significantly from its Swedish counterpart, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of interpretation- either visual or narrative. Still, though, it's a fantastic story, and if you're tempted by this, I'd recommend that you start with the Swedish version and go from there.",1406246400,,706,5.147826086956521

1) This is not a remake of the boring European film.  Forget that idea as fast as you should forget the first film.

2) This IS IN FACT a movie based on one of the best horror novels of the last two decades, Let Me In by John Ajvide Lindqvist.

Do yourself a favor, read the book and see if you have any interest in watching this film.  Or . . . see this film--do NOT buy it--and then read the novel.  The differences are STARK.  That novel will drag you into a mysterious, creepy, and disturbing tale of a bullied boy, a pedophile, and a vampire.  Lots of blood.  Lots of tension.

Anyone who has seen the original should do themselves a favor and take the time to view this film, which is spectacular on so many levels.  It would be hard to classify it as just a horror, romance, drama film after viewing it.  I lived in New Mexico so am very familiar with the setting.  The acting by Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit- McPhee is beyond outstanding.  I was mesmerized from start to finish.  The film makes it easy to identify with both actors and blurs the line between survival and evil. Other reviewers are right when posturing that this is the film that ""Twilight,"" wishes it could have been.  I was bored to tears by the ridiculous Hollywood formula followed by the ""Twilight"" saga.  I would  give it only one star.  It is not a serious film but a safe formulaic Hollywood cash cow.

4319398,2,B004BLJQOK,"Ok, I get it, it's a remake of a Euro film that people are praising as being better than the original, but, does that really make this a must see film? It stars that foul mouthed girl from Kickass and she's a vampire stuck in a 12 year olds body. Low and behold she falls for the 12 year old boy next door. Only the boy doesn't know she is a blood thirsty creature of the night. All she mainly does is give the kid next door a new friend and helps him grow confidence in himself. Other than that it's a pretty drawn out film with no pace, and very stale for the most part. I guess if you can't get enough of the atmosphere and tone of movies like The Sixth Sense, then this movie is the perfect fit next to it on the video shelf. However to me, after hearing this won so many awards for it's genre, and praised so much for being better than it's original European version, it made me wonder whom gives those awards? As, this film, it's not horror. Is it a thriller? Not really. Is it a comedy? Definitely not. So what is it? It's drama. It's just plain and simple drama with a little bit of supernatural element thrown into it.

I can see now why it won so many awards, because it was given those awards by those not truly horror fans and enjoyed this simply because it did not scare them and they have based praising the film on other things besides what it was billed as. Look, I don't mind these kind of movies, but if you are going to say a movie is the #1 horror film of the year, award it to a movie that is actually a horror film, and not one that has a small handful of tiny horror moments thrown into what is otherwise a rather boring love story.

The story itself is not much either, what you expect will happen, happens. And what you predict will happen in the end, happens just that way. There is no twists and turns, and there is certainly no mystery to anything. Worst of all, no surprises. So with all that mentioned, how on Earth is this really considered to be the best horror film of 2013? How was any of it the best of any category other than best drama by adolescents? I can see why people enjoy the movie, but really, shouldn't the best of the best be one you aren't falling asleep to most of the time, come away with memories and perhaps quotes, and then want to watch it a second time, third time, fourth etc .... ???",1403395200,,2340,4.1181619256017505

Chloe Grace Moretz came out and I just couldn't say no to Hit-Girl.
The story itself is actually very well written. It tries to leave you wondering at parts, and tries to touch your heart. I don't want to spoil the move so I won't reveal it, but the movie made me feel good overall. Maybe it's the fact that they were so young it is more heart touching than a romance with adults.

Just like in Kimberley Peirce's Carrie, the story is extremely touching and anyone who has been bullied can easily relate to the wonderful characters in this amazing film, and feel what they feel. It's actually MUCH better than 'Let The Right One In', which is actually a very boring film, and not at all touching, with characters that are so detached you never really cared about, which is the complete reverse than here, were you totally empathize with them.

Matt Reeves shows what a fantastic director and screenwriter he is, following from the very promising 'Cloverfield' (2007). The characters are so realistically drawn and the situations are also so realistic that you complete forget that it's fiction, as apart from the vampire theme everything else could happen to any 12 year old in the world.

Something this masterpiece benefits tremendously of is the total absence of a typically cliched ending, and instead it has one that goes perfectly with the rest of the story, and which you do not see coming at all (unlike so many other films). As well, the atmosphere is wonderfully recreated and allows you to get into the film right away, while the pace of the film (which some may think of as slow) is perfect for the story it tells, and once it's finished (just like with Peirce's Carrie and the best Stephen King's books, such as 'It', 'Christine' or 'Firestarter') you feel a loss (like if a best friend had just moved far away) and just want to watch it again. And again, like with Carrie (2013), this fabulous film just gets better everytime you watch it.",1400457600,,1895,4.827692307692308

4319409,4,B004BLJQOK,"This is a remake of the original LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, a film based on a book of the same name.  The original Norwegian film was well done but included several quirks common in their film-making--as well as having English subtitles that were less than adequate.  However the mood and story were presented more with the imagery than the spoken word.

I had seen the original version years ago and was surprised to see LET ME IN on cable the other night. The story was very familiar, the actors were different, and it took me a while to figure out that this was a remake.  Interestingly enough they showed the original version the very next night.  Two different interpretations of the same novel, one in English and one with subtitles, yet both were true to the book and even to each other.  The author has even commented on how happy he was with this effort, something you don't hear often enough.  If you're a reader like me, film versions of good books tend to deviate substantially from the written word.

Both of these films are well done.  I prefer the darkness of the original but the subtitles throw off the rhythm.  In any event, each one is much more than a horror story.  It's a film of preteens growing up, trusting each other, and making critical sacrifices in time of need.  You won't be disappointed.",1400284800,2,1314,4.521186440677966

CONS: The boy's makeup is overdone.  He's too pale and hair is so black that he looks like a vampire.

Recommendation: The original Swedish version called  ""Let The Right One In"" is better if you don't mind subtitles.

Great storylines are usually foreign movies which get adapted to the American version years later such as:
- The Seven Samurai became The Magnificent Seven
- La Femme Nikita became The Point of No Return
- Train Man became The 40 Year Old Virgin
- Japanese version of ""Shall We Dance"" was remade as an American version.

This is the American remake of Let the Right One In, a Swedish film that is probably the best vampire movie ever made. Two years after its release, this version was made, completely unnecessary in my opinion, but unfortunately many American movie goers won't watch a film that is subtitled. So at least with Let Me In this great story is receiving more exposure. The child actors do a great job, which is a necessity as the story revolves around the relationship between a young boy, ostracized and bullied by his peers and neglected by his parents, and a girl who has moved next door to him in the apartment complex he lives in. Or at least she has the appearance of a young girl. I won't go into the whole plot, as this is definitely a movie that is better to go into with as little knowledge as possible. I'll just say this is a great film that stays true to vampiric lore, no sparkling baseball playing emos (sorry Edward groupies), and yet still has a twisted sort of tenderness to it.

4319430,5,B004BLJQOK,"I had seen this movie a couple of times via a streaming service, but I was hooked onto the story since the first screening. I kept watching it over and over trying to figure out what within the story and the characters touched me in such way I could not think about much else. The story evolves around a young boy Owen (Kodi Smit-McFee) whom is alienated by his divorcing parents and whom is brutally bullied by his peers. I can relate to this person but what touched me the most is the hopelessness of Owen's only friend Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz). Although a sweet and on first appearance innocent girl, everyone she comes in contact with is intentially and unintentially victimized.
I learned that Let me in is the second adaption of the Swedish novel Let the right one in. Two movie adaptions of the same novel naturally calls for a comparison between the two which in my opinion is not fully justified in this case. Sure there are elements in both films which are comparable to eachother but in the end Let me in turns out to be a completely different story than Let the right one in.
I have seen both movie adaptions but I like Let me in way more than the first adaption with the same name as the novel, because the story told in Let me in is much darker and the characters within the story are much deeper, more layered. The ending of both movies is equally ambiguous but when the viewer is prepared to look further than the love story between an alienated boy and an ancient vampire girl, the story and mainly it's characters will be seen in a completely different light.
Let me in should not be considered as another americanized remake and more importantly not be considered as another Twilight kind of glorification of vampirizm. Like with all pieces of art you either love or hate Let me in.
I purchased the Bluray version because I wanted to hear the director's commentary and see the deleted scenes. I was happy to find the bluray here on Amazon as it is not for sale in my country.",1393632000,,1995,4.438692098092643

i have no problem with remakes, and i hope when they are done that they bring new light and new perspectives to familiar material. let me in totally captures the sadness and cold of let the right one in, and it is so somber in tone and appearance that the horror shines through the screen with bloody definition. and honestly, there were a few moments in let the right one in that kind of disrupted the feeling of the movie (cats, anyone?). let me in maintains its' tone without any vibe disruption. i'm not saying it's better, just that it did some things better.

chloe grace moretz was fantastic. she really nailed the amorality and asexuality of abby, while making her manipulative love sincere and sad. kodi smit-macphee was great as owen, a sad sack who finds inner-strength cus someone, even tho they are a 12 year-old vampire with need, finally loves him. macphee was believable as a sad kid with an open-mind. together the two of them were every bit the equal of their swedish counterparts.

4319457,5,B004BLJQOK,"This American version of Let The Right One In starts out blaring at you with sirens, lights, screams, blood, and gore. Typical American alterations to the original which opens with and maintains a quiet, eerie feeling throughout most of it, using soft backing music at times, but also using silence to punctuate. This version tries the same with a constant musical score, almost never using silence and sounds to tell the story gently. Instead this remake tries to shove the mood down your throat with the music..Every soft scene has to have soft piano, every sad scene has to have soft strings, every violent scene has to have pounding drums, etc, etc, etc.
And of course, for the American audience, we get plenty of profanity added, the middle school bullying is given pseudo-sexual overtones, and drugs added as well.
The deepest, most meaningful scenes are reduced to snippets, and the violence, gore, and abuse are prolonged and enhanced.
The secondary characters are blurred into caricatures, eliminated completely, or are hashed together. Even the boy's mother becomes blurred, faceless, and almost irrelevant.
Personal and community involvement is replaced with 'police authority' in the person of a cop who ignores law, private rights, and simple decency.
And Abby's assistant carries out his responsibilities in noisy and deviant ways, losing the humanity that counterpoints his functions in the original. Maybe they tried to make his humanity more apparent with the dialog with Abby,, but they only made him weird and pathetic instead of worn down by time and his actions for her.
Even the snow is ignored by this version, mostly, though is attempted to be used a few times. Using it so rarely only leaves it as a portion of the atmosphere, backing, and not the almost living character of the original.
I won't go into the continuity errors.
Worst of all is the 'flash forward' opening, giving away several major story points that you would pick up from the story as it unfolds. No sense in giving the audience a chance to think for themselves, is there?
This remake really is a mere shadow of the original.
Tepid at times, empty by comparison to the original, and completely Americanized so that you needn't think or look for anything beyond the actors' lines and performances.
Both young leads do well enough, but they could take lessons from the ones in the original.
All that said, on it's own, and not knowing the original film, this movie isn't bad at all. Especially for an American remake of a classic foreign film.

Put simply, ""Let Me In"" is a nearly shot-for-shot remake of ""Let the Right One In"", but it lacks much of what made the original work so well. Even on its own, ""Let Me In"" suffers from lack of character focus, story construction and has too many contradictions to successfully suspend disbelief. While I understand that some consider it as good, if not better than the original, I have my reasons for not sharing that opinion.

Let me say first what I found enjoyable about ""Let Me In"". I thought that the pacing was quite good, perhaps even better than the original in terms of moving along the action. And, the ""car rollover"" scene is also one of the best, most memorable effects I have seen in quite a while. It would be interesting to see a video of how they staged and executed that particular shot which was all from inside the vehicle.

And that's about all I enjoyed in ""Let Me In"".

On the negative side, while ""Let the Right One In"" is about two characters in search of meaning for their lives, ""Let Me In"" is about a rather inept vampire seeking a replacement for her older, clumsy caretaker so she won't have to do the dirty work of killing the victims herself. It's a far less interesting premise that was boxed into virtually the same story format as the original. It was almost as if director Matt Reeves had built his storyboards around each scene in ""Let the Right One In"" and wrote a different story in its place. The result is a film that merely hints at the power of the original novel and first film while falling into many of the old, tired cliches that could have been easily avoided.

""Let Me In"" is not well photographed and uses dark, dingy tones that obscures much of the action of the night scenes. The climactic scene at the pool (an absolute classic in the original) is so dark and confusingly shot that its difficult to discern what is really happening. If you do a shot-for-shot comparison to the original film, in many scenes the actors are positioned or ""blocked"" on the opposite side in ""Let Me In"" which I found somewhat humorous actually. I guess this is not a criticism, but more of an observation about how much seems copied from the first film in terms of how the actors are positioned.

Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby) may be fine actors in their own right, but I saw absolutely no chemistry between them at all. Furthermore, Chloe's speech pattern of soft, unemotional whispers dilutes her character to the point of being rather uninteresting. She conveys none of the wisdom or even world wariness of being a centuries-old vampire.

Perhaps my issues with ""Let Me In"" could be summed up by the ""Cop"" character played by Elias Koteas. Apparently, and this is not made very clear, Elias is on the trail of what he thinks is a ""Satanic cult"" which I assume are Abby and her Caretaker (Richard Jenkins) going from town to town killing people. When Elias knocks on the door to Abby's apartment for the second time in the film, he suspects that whoever is inside MIGHT (operative word: MIGHT) know something about the killings. He hears the floorboard gently squeak from inside the apartment, so he draws his gun and KICKS in the door, breaking and entering for NO reason at all. Why would he do such a thing instead of calling for backup and keeping the apartment under surveillance until getting a warrant? Well, because the script told him to enter and *SPOILER ALERT* get killed, that's why. It makes no sense, but there it is.

""Let Me In"" just doesn't work and pales considerably when compared to the original. But even if I hadn't seen the original first, it would have been pretty difficult for me to find much to like about this movie. A shame really since another interpretation of the original novel would have made ""Let Me In"" a worthwhile effort. But instead, it is but a pale, albeit dark and dingy shadow of the original film with nothing new to add.",1383436800,4,4024,4.54696132596685

Difficult to explain, but the story is so different from the worn out genre that I have added both video versions to my video library ('Let Me In' and 'Let the Right One In').  The story, acting, direction and screen-play are superb.  Very captivating and haunting.  Not easily forgotten.",1383004800,,364,4.640625
4319462,5,B004BLJQOK,"Not just an awesome horror film. This always just pulls me in, one of my favorite movies. An adaptation of a Swedish novel & film, Matt Reeves & his cast did a great job with this. The leads are amazing. You find yourself rooting for them, even though they're headed down a very dark road. That's how good the story is. Yes it's a vampire movie but it's really so much more. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1382659200,,415,4.265822784810126

This is another of the growing list of smart films for Chloe.  I gave it four stars, but I've never given any move five stars - so this one ranks high on my list.  If there's any theme to the films Chloe picks is that she goes for strong feminine roles - which is all the more interesting considering her age (roughly 12).  Kick-Ass broke the mold for action heroes with Chloe as Hit Girl, and this film once again places a young female in a position of authority and power.  The movie itself is a combination of several successful themes.  It's a love story for one, it deals with the supernatural for two, it addresses bullying in a meaningful and honest way, it teaches acceptance and tolerance and - as mentioned - portrays a young woman as a hero figure.  At its core is a film about adolescent love and coming of age that will resonate with just about anyone that has lived through (or is living through) their own adolescence.",1382486400,,1110,4.232227488151659
4319464,5,B004BLJQOK,"I had never heard of this movie before. I noticed the box cover and thought it looked really creepy. Then I found out it was a vampire movie. I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies or anything closely related to them. Something about it seemed a little intriguing so I took a chance on it. OMG! Where has this movie been all my life!? This is definitely not aimed at the Twilight viewer. This was one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. I hesitate to even qualify it as a vampire movie. Yes she is a vampire, but there are so many layers to this movie. It is scary at times, and very moving at others. Kodi Smit-McPhee is so good in his role, you really just want to hug him and tell him everything will be okay. Chloe Moretz also does an excellent job in her role (she is starring as Carrie in the remake). Did anyone notice that they never show the moms face in the movie? It was kinda strange and intriguing. And I don't want to spoil anything but pretty much everything you want to happen in the movie does. So that is quite different to have a happy ending in a scary movie. My husband was so excited that I found this unexpected gem of a movie. We are definitely putting it in our Halloween movie rotation. I don't know why this movie didn't get more publicity. Maybe it did and I somehow missed it, but I am so happy that I found it and I would recommend this to anyone! Vampire fan or not, you will love the story.

No, no, no - this introduces a compassionate protagonist and an antagonist that you can (almost) pity. Without giving away the plot behind Amazon's basic description, let me just say that there are tender, non-vampiric moments scattered in this moderately paced tale of pre-teen angst. Even though the two main characters are 12 (one, for a very long time), this is NOT a movie for anyone under the age of 14 - so be advised.",1381795200,2,513,4.840909090909091

4319467,5,B004BLJQOK,"I think I did it backwards. First I saw this movie, then read reviews claiming that the original foreign version was better so I borrowed that one from the library. Then I read the book.

Let Me In conceals the fact that Abby is actually a boy who was castrated. It hints at it with lines like ""What if I'm not a boy"" but never explains what that means. I took it to mean that she was a vampire and not  human. The book removes all doubt with an explanation of how and when the sex  change happened..
Then there is her companion. Let Me In leads the viewer to think that she teamed up with him when he was a boy and will be replaced by her new friend, Owen. Looking ahead, the viewer expects that Owen will also be replaced eventually. The book clearly shows that this is not the case at all. The man is a monster!  That said, I prefer Let Me In to the original foreign film, Let the Right One In and also prefer it to the book which provides details omitted in the movie. This is one of the very few movies I have seen in which I would not have changed a thing.",1380412800,,1062,4.018957345971564

Elias Koteas lends his underused, drastically underused, gravitas to it, and wait, so too does Richard Jenkins, two actors with amazing gravity and integrity, and they are just not used enough or correctly, but here they are, and they are just circling around the young actors, and then we have a perfect little film. Amazing. If you have any love for this genre, you must watch it. The young actress is phenomenonal, but then so too is the young man. I watch it, and one of the things that strikes me is, will I be able to take the introduction of 'Romeo and Juliet' as a metaphor, that seems forced initially. But the director has it figured out.

Vampires are afraid of crosses (OK, so the movie really doesn't show this, but it is a rule so this happend in my mind!)

4319480,5,B004BLJQOK,"Great movie, one of the rare vampire films with some actual thought behind it.  Moretz is wonderful, begging the question (although she can hardly be considered a child anymore) why she isn't universally recognized as the greatest child star since the previously incomparable Margaret O'Brien.
The best thing about this film (other than Moretz) is that the filmmakers actually sat down and thought about what it would be like to actually live (un-live?) as a vampire.  It avoids occult mumbo-jumbo (no Master Vampire, no Lilith who inexplicably commands the obedience of lesser bloodsuckers)and realistically (a strange word in this context, of course, but you know what I mean) portrays the daily struggle-to-survive of a formerly human child who is now a creature of the night.  In what is probably my favorite moment of all vampire cinema, the vampire is asked by her human pet why she can't enter a human residence without being invited. We've all seen this scene a thousand times, and know what's coming next: some sophomoric pseudo-scientific ""explanation"", or the previously-mentioned occult B.S.  This vampire, here, answers as a real vampire probably would: ""I don't know"".  She doesn't have time to waste exploring arcane vampiric lore or searching for the Ur-Dracula: her free time is spent scrounging around for something to eat.",1374796800,,1341,5.21860465116279
4319481,5,B004BLJQOK,"This is my all-time favorite vampire movie! As much a story of budding young love as it is the ""need to feed"", we observe 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) meeting a mysterious new girl who walks around barefoot in the snow. Begrudgingly at first, the girl, Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), succumbs to Owens wide-eyed, innocent charm, and they soon become fast friends.  Unfortunately, four bullies also find Owen an interesting target for their first mayhem/murder. Abby's growing love for Owen provides positive protection when needed, and we observe a life-long devotion develop between the two teens.

If you like vampire movies, you'll love this one. If you like love stories, you'll love this one! Kodi Smit-McPhee adds credibility and Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl of ""Kick Ass 1&2"" fame) weaves her magic yet again in another dazzling performance!",1374105600,,851,5.204379562043796

This is not another Twilight movie. ...This movie is SERIOUS and this vampire has been 12 years old for many years.  ..Not a mega budget hollywood production, but there is enough suspense, drama, violence, and special effects to keep you hooked. ..If you remember your first ""crush"", this movie will push your buttons.

This movie improves on the original (""Let The Right One In""), primarily because Chloe Moretz is a more talented actress. ..Otherwise, there are only slight differences between the two movies.  ..The most unique and entertaining vampire movie I've seen.

Minor Point: The only thing I didn't care for was when Chloe went into ""vampire mode"" she looked very much like Linda Blair in the Exorcist (really over the top). ..Blood shot eyes, pale white complexion, and fangs would have been more inline with the rest of this movie.",1373587200,,1099,4.983606557377049

The choice to make the vampire make-up conform to every other Hollywood version was a bad one, it lost all the depth and eeriness that the original had and really seemed to help make this film more two-dimensional than it should have been. After watching the original, I felt compelled to talk to someone about what I was getting from the film and what I thought the relationship really was between the main characters.

While the original Swedish film, Let The Right One In is superior in certain aspects, this one generally pays an honorable homage to it. This is solidly crafted movie making that stands well on its own. The atmosphere is thick, the score is sometimes gloriously haunting and also often beautiful, then downright terrifying. Indeed the music in this film deserves a lot of credit because it really helps set the tone for the movie and its better than most film scores I have heard in some time. Over all this version is much like the original, and while there are some sparse moments that were done better in the original I do think that certain aspects of this version were much more entertaining. In particular the boys who bully our main character. In this film they are far more menacing and hateful. They simply make much nastier bad guys. Some of the blood and gore is done better here as well. But director Matt Reeves does such a perfect job on this production I am interested in seeing some of his other work. This guy is a gifted director. I do have one minor gripe, and that is Chloe Moretz is not as unique or compelling as the original actress who played Eli, the vampire girl in the original film. Shes just not as creepy despite taking on an evil appearance occasionally while the vampire in the other movie didnt. But there is so much about this film that stands a good deal above most vampire films made over the past 20 years.

Truly one of the most unforgettable films I have ever seen the atmosphere, music are top notch. The creepiest part of this is how it mixes absolute horrific actions by Abby and makes you geniunley feel for her and Owens deep lonliness. Abby  played by Chole Grace Mortez is fantastic in a part where its not important of how much she says to owen but how and what little she information she gives to owen which makes the movie even more sad and more creepy. An absolute fantastic scene done even better then the original was when Abby enters owens apartment uninvited at his prompting even after she asks owen to let her in or invite her in I should say, he doesnt she enters and starts bleeding from her eyes and body and owen yells I invite you come in she collapses owen grabs and hugs her weakened body and asks here what is that?  Abby answers I don't know, this is what makes the movie so sad and tragic she really doesnt know why she is what she is . You don't need to be a vampire lover to like this movie in fact if you hate the subject you might also like this however a great many people will find it too slow too dark, if you love sad sweet and occasionally the horrific this one might be for you it is not easily forgettable due to a haunting score fantastic acting by both main characters. One of my all time favorite films, both versions let me in and let the right one are fantastic and evveryone should see both as there aspects in each that are one better, I think and stress think I like let the right one in just a tad better but it depends on the mood, movies that is about a very unlikely and special relationship that happens to include vampires, even if u hate the vampire angle see it its sad sweet and haunting.",1367452800,,2046,4.2301790281329925

It follows the original pretty faithfully but adds some SFX that are not over-the-top and I feel it is actually superior to the original. There is one part from the original that they did not end up putting in this version and I don't think it took away from it at all.

The friendship between Abby and Owen is quite incredible and is very believable especially considering when Owen finds out about her secret. The subplot of Owen dealing with school bullies adds nicely to the story and reminds us of just how rough it can be to be a kid.

4319505,3,B004BLJQOK,"These movies are sort of difficult to rate.  On one hand both tell a compelling story, are fairly well acted, and have satisfying conclusions.  On the other hand neither are really scary- at all.  The jump scares that are put in do not induce any fright and very little reaction.  So here is my problem.  Which trumps in this situation?  To help break this down I will examine each against each other, because I do feel that one is the superior movie.  I'll come out and say now that I prefer Let the Right One In, which is the original Swedish film.  The subject matter dealt with in both of these films is difficult for any actor, let alone children.  Both movies are well directed and reveal how the director was approaching the source material, which I will admit I am unfamiliar with.  Going by the films alone I think much of this is going to be personal preference in the end.  I'll begin with the tones of the films.  The Swedish version plays up the innocence in the main character, Oskar.  Throughout the film he has a real naivet about him that never leaves, whereas Owen in the American version has much more anger.  This speaks to the sensibilities of the countries in which they were made.  In the States there are very few characters cut from Oskar's ilk anymore.  We want our protagonists strong and willing to fight, Oskar is not this.  Even in the scene where he does fight back, it is very subdued.  When the main antagonist begins bleeding from the ear I was genuinely shocked because it barely looked like he was hit.  I was expecting Oskar to hit him with the pole, have little effect, and still have the snot beat out of him.  It wasn't important how hard he hit, just that he did.  Owen, though, wants to cause pain.  He is angry and feels helpless and this fuels his rage.  It doesn't help that we feel less for the antagonist in the American version.  Neither versions have this character fleshed out, other than a brief mention of him being bullied in the home.  This backstory in itself bothers me because it is so cliche.
Another stark difference between the two characters comes when we are first introduced to them.  Oskar is seen in his room with a large knife acting out the famous 'You talkin' to me' scene from Taxi Driver.  We can see that this is the kind of guy he wants to be- someone who is strong and unafraid.  Owen has a similiar moment when we meet him.  He also has a large knife, but he is acting just like his bully, using the same words that are used on him.  He does not want to be someone who is strong and unafraid, but he wants to inflict his pain on others.  There is a real sense that if he were in the bullies position he would not hesitate to torture another person.  I think this makes him less sympathetic as a character.
The other important part of this film is the character of Eli/Abby.  Here it is harder to differentiate.  Both actresses play the character in a very similiar matter.  Both are terrible at being vampires in the sense that they do not have any subtlty or stealth in their attacks.  The Swedish version does not has quite as much on-screen with Eli in vampire form as the American version.  This again goes back to the sensiblities of the coutries they were targeting.  Other than that both are done well, though I do still feel that the Swedish version comes out ahead.  The characters killed seem to have more reason to be killed rather than just being there at the time.

Overall both of these moves are good.  If I had to rate them I would put Let Me In at 3 while Let the Right One In is 3.5.  Both tell good stories, but neither are really scary.  Worth watching if you like a good tale with some subtitles.",1362960000,3,3691,4.358296622613803

Chloe Moretz was amazing as Abby, following her role in Kick-Ass, this girl is definitely going places. I didn't like Abby much thou. I found her very manipulative, not to mention how creepy it is that an ageless vampire, who looks like a little girl, is hooking up with a 12 yrs old kid.

4319516,5,B004BLJQOK,"My title may be a bit too light-hearted for this film, based as was the Swedish film on the Swedish novel ""Let The Right One In"".  This is a dark, dark fairy tale, a sort of modern-day unedited version of a Grim's Fairy Tale wherein the creature that swoops in and saves the child in peril happens to be a vampire.

This version, which IMHO is the technical equal of the Swedish version in every respect, is more of a dark romance (insofar as there can be ""romance"" between a preteen boy and a vampire in the body of a preteen girl).  Both young leads are brilliant and I see nothing but success and possibly Oscar nominations and actual wins ahead of them if they can keep their heads on straight in a way that other ""stars"" who begin as younsters have failed to do, especially the exquisite Chloe Moretz.

I won't rehash the basic plot on this review, as I did on my review of its Swedish counterpart.  I will say this:  I am likely to watch the Swedish original as an ""alternative"" to the usual fare on Halloween night, while I might watch this version on Valentine's Day - ""My Bloody Valentine"".  My suggestion to all my fellow fans of sanguinary cinema is to add both of these to your collection, posthaste.

4319521,4,B004BLJQOK,"Having caught glimpses of the original Let the Right One In (LTROI) on Showtime Beyond a month or so ago I was truly intrigued and finally was able to watch it in its' entirety about a week ago. As someone who enjoys foreign films and is not intimidated by sub-titles, I actually prefer foreign language versions to any dubbed effort. Well I was treated to one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. Beautiful, sad, horrific and  yes, erotic, I also saw one the of the best vampire films ...EVER! There was a gorgeous subtlety and visceral impact to the effects in LTROI. Let Me In (LMI), which I had to and did watch ASAP, took most of its cues from the original, but was still a thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right... And it brought out two very important aspects that I missed (?) in the original LTROI.... Firstly when Abby/Eli tells Owen/Oskar, ""I'm not a girl"" I simply thought she/he was referring to the fact that she/he is not human, i.e. ""I'm not a girl, I'm a vampire..."" (Also in LTROI intially I thought the actress Lina Liandersson was a boy!) But a scene in LTROI where we see a quick shot of a scar on Eli's lower abdomen combined with Matt Reeves commentary on the deleted scenes for LMI was that Abby/Eli was in fact a castrated young boy... I have not as yet read the original novel, which I assume will give more details as to Abby/Eli's origin... It's next on my reading list... Secondly I almost gasped while watching LMI that a key item I missed while watching LTROI was when I realized that Abby was not just befriending Owen as a kindred soul but in fact was recruiting him as her next ""Caretaker""... Abby/Eli has lived for hundreds of years and has had probably a dozen caretakers, humans who protect them during their vulnerable times like Straker in Salem's Lot, and who eventually grow old and die (or burn themselves into unrecognizable states with acid). In LTROI we see the caretaker simply grow old and careless and completely incapable of completing his duties while in LMI we see the caretaker become bitter and angry at his incompetence and yet both endlessly love their charges to the point of offering themselves for feeding before dying. Owen/Oskar has now become Abby/Eli's new ""love"" and will transport her/him and enable her/him to survive... Absolutely brilliant...

PS When Eli/Abby's caretaker asks her/him not to see that boy again, is it concern or jealousy? Hmmm...",1355443200,,2425,4.663551401869159

Unlike most vampire movies which dwell on horror and suspense this movie has that but centers around the interaction and seduction of a twelve year old bullied and lonely boy by a ""twelve year old girl"" vampire.  The child actors are very good as is the directing.  Symbolic of the boy's isolation is the absence of any direct camera views of his divorced parents.

4319526,1,B004BLJQOK,"It pains me to see it once again: Hollywood plagiarizing original ideas and claiming them as their own. It's not hard to see why someone felt that this story could yield more money from the U.S. viewers - 'Let the Right One in', the Swedish film from which 'Let Me In' was blatantly copied from, was in fact a masterpiece in it's own right. To call this movie anything more than a facile, dumbed down imitation would be an insult to every great, original movie there exists.

Aside from a couple of altered lines; some stripped scenes; a new, English speaking cast and an unnecessarily cheesy angel chorus score present all about the movie (to guide the poor viewer in his/her confused emotions), there were no real differencies. 'Let Me In' had some new CGI, which was outright needless to deliver the impact, as can be seen when comparing this to LTROI. The actors were worse here - an overload of that classic American mannerism we've seen a thousand times before, with little chemistry whatsoever. From the book, there were no new scenes which LTROI didn't have, which makes me suspect the creators of this movie did not even bother to read the book, but settled only to lazily copy the original film into another hollow remake.

Some will moan about this being a whole different movie that shouldn't be contrasted next to it's inspirer, but that would be false. This IS 'Let the Right One In', made again in almost exact same style, with almost all scenes and lines exactly the same. Of course it is a magnificent story well implemented, but it is still a ripoff that should have never seen the daylight.

I would not recommend this film, but instead 'Let the Right One In', the film 'Let Me In' tries so desperately to be. It has been done once, it needen't be done again.",1354579200,3,1778,4.584905660377358

This film is about a boy that gets picked on a lot at school. Life is very hard for him, and he feels lonely much of the time. One day he befriends a girl living in a nearby apartment. She keeps him company, and gives him confidence. She also puts an end to the bullying he is suffering from. There is something not right about this girl. He learns that she is a vampire. Her secret shocks him, but he wants to stay with her regardless.

This is a pretty cute love story about two children. It also has a heavy helping of violence and darkness. I really enjoyed it. It does have a depressing vibe about it, but it's a different take on the vampire theme. It explores the love between a vampire girl and a human boy.

The plot development was excellent.  The way the movie begins, you don't have a clue as to who that character is until later, at which point the movie really leaps to the super-creepy level.

I don't like to describe details about the movie because it will potentially ruin the suspense for those who have yet to watch this movie.  It will not disappoint. The ""innocent adolescent attraction"" as well as the ""common bullying known to occur among adolescents"" factor is really engaging and contributes to the eventual ""okay, who-knows-what"" moment--making that transition definitely creepier.

I am a firm believer that remakes, unless made superior to the original, are patently redundant, especially when there is no perceptible difference between the two.  Except for the cast, language, and a title improvement, there isn't much of a variation between these two films to warrant a remake.
A glutton for punishment, I've watched both (and given both away afterwards).
I found both films haunting and was overwhelmed by a lingering sadness from each.  I preferred the American title only because it made more sense.  I also loved the score by Michael Giacchino in the American version.  I thought the cinematography by Greig Fraser was brilliant.  The cast couldn't be improved on, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Elias Koteas were all heartbreaking in their performances.
Now comes the dilemma.  On one hand, I applaud the artistry that went into both films but on the other hand, I can't say I actually enjoyed watching either, nor do I ever want to see either of them again.  So how to I rate this version?  It's well made but I didn't like it.  It's one thing to appreciate art for what it is, quite another thing to have it hanging in your home.  In this case, I'll err on the side of art.",1350604800,,1264,4.598214285714286
4319534,5,B004BLJQOK,"I can count the horror movies I consider to be worth watching on the fingers of my two hands, and still have a few digits left over.  I love the genre but hate the way it's been handled by untalented producers in search of a quick buck. At best their efforts are good for a mindless laugh.  At worst they're not worth watching even for their insights into the minds of angst-ridden teenagers and Romney supporters.

Fortunately, every once in a while a true gem like this film comes along.  Set in a dreary wasteland, it tells the story of Owen, a 12 year old boy who's tormented both by bullies at school and his own feelings of powerlessness.  Into his life comes Abby, a creature who is cursed to an unending existence of feeding on human blood. The two form an uneasy friendship, which is complicated by Abby's unwillingness to share much about herself.  She offers Owen things he has never experienced before: encouragement and acceptance.  Under her tutelage he musters the courage to fight back against the boys who abuse him.  He also takes his first tenuous steps towards manhood, driven partially by his attraction to his new friend.

As the plot develops, we never know if Abby really cares for Owen or is simply grooming him to serve her own dark purposes.  They're both drawn deeper into each other's worlds as the plot develops, until Owen is confronted with Abby's true nature.  He must then decide if he will fight her, flee from her, or learn to embrace her as she truly is.  The climactic scene is a masterpiece of understated menace that sent chills through me.

Moderately explicit (by today's standards) in terms of its gore content, the scenes of graphic violence are used artistically, not gratuitously, and there is no sex.  But there is a powerful theme of seduction, which is illustrated masterfully from one scene to the next.

I made the decision to watch the movie anyway and it paid off wonderfully.  It's about a little kid around 12 who gets picked on by bullies at school and after school when it's dark and cold outside, he frequently meets up with (and eventually befriends) a demon girl his own age who has a craving for blood unbeknownst to the boy.  They hit off a friendship that's one of the more unusual ways to develop one, haha.

What makes Let Me In work so well is how it perfectly blends sad emotions with just the right touch of orchestration in the soundtrack, and combines these feelings with the surprise and gruesome factor of the horror genre with tons of bloody, violent and unpredictable murders thanks to the demon girls neverending pursuit for blood.  Seems like a bad combination on paper doesn't it?  Well somehow, I loved it.  It's an odd combination, and at first I wasn't sure it'd even work but after watching the entire thing, I'm left to believe the writing is top-notch, intelligent and compelling.  The storyline flows with such ease that the only time you're really lost is right after the boy meets the demon girl and the girl ventures on her own for a little while.  However, everything eventually falls into place and makes sense.

The bullies are exceptionally vicious and unforgiving, but that just makes the ending even better.  That basically covers what the film is about.  Might have to turn the volume up high however, because there's tons of whispering between the boy and girl.  It's really amazing just how much of a connection the two of them have.

I also screened the original ""Let the Right One In,"" which I really liked.  But I liked this film even more.  I think that it came down to the acting for me; the leads in this film I thought were just better than the leads in the foreign film.  But both films are excellent so you really can't go wrong either way.

I could go on and on about the plot, but I find that a little boring.  I would rather discuss what I believed this film was trying to say.  Or rather make that, what question was this film asking of the viewer.  For me, what I thought about was this:  what would I be willing to do for love?  How far would I be willing to go?

The setup in this movie was terrific in the sense that, even though the Chloe Moretz character could be argued as evil (I don't think that I'm giving anything away there) you can completely understand why the Kodi Smit-McPhee character was still in ""love"" with her.  (You might be tempted to argue, ""They're too young to be in love,"" and you might have a point.  But I'm not much interested in semantics here so call it what you will.)  He's a loner, she may as well be a loner, and they both have something that the other needs.  And they both connect and understand each other in some fairly unexpected ways.

It has been a while since I've seen this, but I've seen it twice.  From what I remember, there is a scene where Mr. McPhee was sitting in class while they were discussing the film ""Romeo and Juliet.""  This itself could be argued to be a Romeo-and-Juliet tale itself - he's a mere mortal and she's a, well, you'll find out, and they have standard difficulties just hooking up - although the ending might just surprise you.",1348444800,,1849,4.231428571428571

I proceeded to watch Let the Right One In several more times and found myself enjoying it more and more.

This review is from: Let the Right One In (English Subtitled) (Amazon Instant Video)
Let Me In is a great movie made in 2010 and the description never mentions that it is a complete remake of Let the Right One In made 2 years earlier in 2008. Both are very very good movies. Each earns it's 5 stars. My personal preference is the International favorite LET THE RIGHT ONE IN. Please, don't watch it with the dubbed voices. I am not crazy about reading subtitles but MOST movies are much better in the original language. Dubbed movies just don't have the same emotion and can't match the subtle nuances.
There is no sense in telling anything about the movie as calling it a vampire movie does it an injustice as it is so much more than that. Telling you anything about the boy or the girl ruins the mystery aspect of the film. Not knowing where it is going, where it came from or how it will end is what makes a 5 star movie along with great acting from the children and adults.
Don't read anything about it. Just watch it and enjoy a great movie experience.",1347753600,,1343,4.304347826086956

4319541,4,B004BLJQOK,"After seeing the original foreign version of this story called LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, I was prepared for another over-produced, over-wrought American version...but I am pleasantly surprised!

In fact, I think I like this version better.  Set in a dark, wintry New Mexico with 80's songs playing just within hearing, this story about a lonely, bullied young boy who befriends a mysterious barefoot girl knows what needs to be done to tell a good story while not wallowing in gory excess.  Which is not to say there's none, but it's always just the right amount that the effects never overwhelm the story.  One definite improvement: I loved the attacks, which are so jarring as they come from a sweet little girl.  They also lend a poignancy to the scenes where she's trying to just find someone to connect with.

One thing I would've addressed: was the little girl's ""father"" in the first half of the film once a child with her who ages as a human?  Kind of a dovetailing moment that could've been underscored a little clearer.

But I'm quibbling.  An excellent horror film for all the fans who are tired of the mindless gorefests we have to endure these days.",1345680000,2,1158,4.665024630541872

We had both seen ""Let the Right One In"" and loved it.  Such a beautifully made movie, and my heart just breaks for Eli and Oskar.  I couldn't get the movie out of my head, and I read many reviews of the film, just to learn others' perspectives.  Of course, I read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-Me-In/dp/0312656491/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let Me In</a>&nbsp;that preceded the movie.  All of it helped me to better appreciate Let the Right One In.  This was why I was excited to learn that an American version would be made.  When discussing this with my friend, he was horrified that there would be a remake, and thought that it was an insult to the Swedish film.

What a challenge for Matt Reeves, the director, to make his version of a film that was beloved by audiences around the world.  The essence of the story remains the same: a young boy, Owen, is horribly bullied by classmates at school, and he's neglected by his single mother at home.  When Abby moves into his apartment complex, Owen finds a kindred spirit - a young girl who seems every bit as lonely as he is.  She promises Owen she will protect him, and by the end of the film, she certainly fulfills that promise.  When Owen learns her secret, and when Abby's own life is at risk, he returns the favor.

Chloe Grace Moretz as Abby is fantastic.  She had already proven her ability to play a strong, young girl in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B003TOMAPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>.  There are scenes that made my heart race (especially the car scene.)  I thought the rearranging of the chronology of several scenes worked well, although I wondered if Reeves' main intention of this was to differentiate himself.  It's an excellent movie that deserves to be seen.  Overall, though, Let the Right One In is the superior movie, and it has nothing to do with the fact that it came first.",1338249600,,2265,5.515942028985507
4319547,5,B004BLJQOK,"Many people loved the Swedish LET THE RIGHT ONE IN when it founds its ways to the United States.  Like any successful foreign film, Hollywood had to create an American one to capitalize on this success.  Luckily, the American remake, LET ME IN, is just as good as its predecessor and in some regards better.  Matt Reeves (of CLOVERFIELD) does a fantastic job of understanding what made the original great and putting his own stamp on it.  The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery is rich with detail, and the pacing (while some may find it a bit slow) felt spot on.  The child actors (Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are terrific.

LET ME IN is not really all that scary, but it is both interesting and thrilling.  I'd recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a slow burning, spooky thriller.  Fans of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATOO, or THE ROAD, will find plenty to enjoy here.

Now for the movie, ""Let Me In"" is a better American adaptation of the foreign movie. I found that I could relate to the movie more and understand what was happening better.  I also thought the star Chloe Moretz had awesome performance. And really showed of her acting skills. The graphics in this movie was great, as they were fast pace and realistic.

I'm into alternative love stories like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""500 Days of Summer,"" and ""Say Anything,"" and I would say this movie fits well into that genre. It does feature scenes of horror and gore that some would find disturbing but I enjoy horror as well. I highly recommend this movie.

Movies like this tend to falter if the script is terrible, even if there's a good cast. Fortunately, Let Me In has a good script and the whole movie is a real treat from start to finish.

The film is really powered by Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee. The two young actors are given a big task of essentially carrying the film. The maturity level of the two of them is incredible and they handle some pretty dark stuff in this movie.

There haven't been many horror movies as riveting as Let Me In recently. It might be a remake of the Swedish film, but it has plenty of character in its own right. After seeing the original, I was amazed at how Let Me In paid homage to the book and the film while maintaining a level of originality in its own right. I suppose that's probably because Moretz and Smit-McPhee are vastly different from the actors in the original film. Personally, I liked them better.

If you like horror movies, you have to watch Let Me In. Too many horror movies are made these days that lack character and are just plain silly. Let Me In pays respect to the genre, but allows itself the chance to make its mark.",1332460800,,1252,4.274261603375527

4319554,4,B004BLJQOK,"Matt Reeves' ""Let Me In,"" an American version of a Swedish film (English title, ""Let the Right One In""), succeeds brilliantly where so many American reworkings of European films fail.  Far from a pale retread or an empty star vehicle, ""Let Me In"" may be the most intelligent and thought-provoking vampire movie ever.

The film is set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the early 1980s.  Not only does the name ""Los Alamos"" set an ominous tone from the outset, but the time period is a good one for alienation and abandonment (as well as some pretty good tunes on the soundtrack).  Divorce was growing more and more common, but it was still one of those issues that carried a fair weight of shame.  Naturally, our hero is a kind, meek boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of ""The Road"") whose parents are divorcing.  Owen's mother appears to be the short straw in the broken marriage as she's a bit of a religious nut who drowns her agony in wine before she falls asleep on the couch.  Owen's dad seems decent, but he never gets closer to Owen than a concerned phone call.

Owen is alone in a cold world.  Friendless and an only child, he's bullied at school by three bigger boys.  The bullying scenes are handled extremely well - they are just as uncomfortable and riveting as the more bloody action scenes the movie has in store.

Alone, that is, until the mysterious Abby arrives.  Abby (Chloe Moretz) is either attractively mysterious or mysteriously attractive - she walks through the snow without shoes and doesn't get cold.  Her melancholy dad (Richard Jenkins) is a melancholy, tortured soul, for reasons the movie makes painfully clear.  Jenkins, one of our most under-rated actors, does a magnificent job with his few lines, including his weighty admonition to Abby, ""Please stay away from that boy.""

Owen eventually learns that Abby is a vampire, but he doesn't care - she is kind to him. In a weaker movie, Abby would become Owen's guardian angel, dispensing comeuppances and one-liners while allowing Owen to become his school's alpha dog.  ""Let Me In"" has another message - there is a high price to be paid for being a vampire's friend.  Indeed, Abby's dad really isn't her dad, but instead someone who knows all too well what's in store for Owen should he get too close to Abby.

Violent without being a bloodfest, scary without resorting to the ""jump-out-from-behind-the-door"" cliches that the ""Scream"" franchise mocked so well, ""Let Me In"" is a true horror movie.  The movie's final scene, innocent enough on its face, sends chills down your spine as you realize the lifetime of horrors that await.  It's not perfect, but after the years of ""Buffy,"" ""Twilight,"" and other campy vampire stuff ""Let Me In"" represents a triumphant return of horror to the vampire genre.",1329091200,8,2774,4.7635983263598325

4319556,5,B004BLJQOK,"Both the American film ""let me in"" , (Blu-ray : 2010)), and the Swedish film it was a remake of, ""let the right one in"", (DVD: March 10, 2009),  are best understood as diverging branches of the book ""Lt den rtte komma in"" by John Ajvide Lindqvist and translated into English by Ebba Segerberg as ""let the right one in"".

On a superficial level the American film is a sequel of the Swedish film streamlined and made more pretty and simple of point for American audiences. On that level the American film with Chloe Moretz as ""Ally"" and Kody Smit-McPhee as Owen is a motivationally reprehensible but nevertheless surprisingly successful sequel.

But if you understand the basic reality behind the book you can look at both pictures as taking it in different directions in a way that makes them both meaningful in entirely different ways.

To understand what you're watching you have to think about 3 metaphors.

1st, think of the universe is an avalanche of overwhelming situations in which little tiny creatures like human beings are but pebbles in the machinery of inevitable cause and effect.

2nd, think of heartless mother nature in which every creature is justified by the way mother nature is designed that creature to survive. There is no such thing as nice or wrong and simply following your biological imperative.

And the 3rd thing is to understand that if we are lucky and have a little space in our life where we have enough to eat and we are in a place where we have the leisure to develop friendships based on tender emotions and altruism then we live in it like gold fish in a bowl. Such kindness is an accident in the universe and in his brief and so you must enjoy it for what it is, a meaningless glitch of light in darkness.

The reality of Eli (Lina Leandersson) in the book in Swedish movie, and alley as she is called the American film, is that she was a little child murdered by a vampire when she was 12 years old some 200 years previously. She has no sex drive, none of her body organs or brain or any social processes will ever come to her that she didn't already have a 12. She has lived by feeding on people and it must've destroyed several thousand innocent lives over the years.

In all 3 portrayals of that girl is understood that she is grooming the new boy to replace the old man in her life. The likelihood that after 200 years of killing the special charm of meeting a new young boy is not likely to have awakened her little heart so long conditioned by killing. A sweetness on her part can only be a cold-blooded manipulation.

This is where I think the American movie is more truthful even if it trims more of the story and the context away. The Chloe Moretz version of ""Alley"" is a girl who was always watching your eyes to see if you are buying the lie.

On the other hand, Lina Leandersson version of ""Eli"" is given the many scenes in which she is shown as being genuinely sweet and responsive. I believe this is an intentional misdirection by the director in Sweden. He said in the extras on the DVD that he had no political ideas when making the film. That means that he jettisoned most of the writer's own context for the story. In short, Tomas Alfredson wanted to make a cautionary tale about violence and parental apathy but mostly a timeless Romeo and Juliet story of preteen love. He succeeded. The music and the romance works even though it is an intentional lie. The better film is actually an intentional misdirection.

Perhaps because an American film remake has such low expectations the American director Matt Reeves felt he could tell the harsher story. But it's ironic that the nature of the boy actor as a film presence made the love story even though was a lie a tragedy. The boys knew he was going to grow up to be that other guy. Oscar in the Swedish film really was serial killer in utero. That tragic aspect of the sweetness without illusion presented by Kody Smit-McPhee I think made the relationship deeper because it was so self-consciously a human being going all the way with lying to themselves without being fooled for a moment.

It is maybe a rush to judgment to say that the Swedish film was better, when in one important core way it said what the book said about life.

That little girl is mother nature. You've seen the blood on her face. And she's asking you ""do you still love me?""",1328227200,,4354,4.481060606060606

Vampires do not feed off themselves and they don't combust either...but that is just the typical hog-wash people want to believe about Vampires and that they are ""mythical"". I still enjoy this movie as it is a love story and about a 12 year old girl who was turned into a Vampire and how she copes with her new exsistance. Try to put yourself in her head and you will see what a Vampire has to go through everyday forever.

4319560,5,B004BLJQOK,"This is one of those rare Hollywood remakes of a good Euro film - in this case the Swedish ""Let the Right One In"" - that is actually better than the original.  While I liked the original 2008 film, I thought it left too many questions unanswered which drew away attention from the main story.  This includes the controversial vampire he-or-she question.  More on that later.  This film which was brilliantly directed and written by ""Cloverfield's"" Matt Reeves, smartly avoids the question for the most part.

The best thing about this sweet, tender, violent, bloody movie is the 2 young leads.  Both should go far and I expect Chloe Moretz will break a few hearts along the way.  The film does closely follow the predecessor and even repeats some dialog word for word.  Transplanted to remote Los Alamos, New Mexico, the film works on every level.  At times you forget you are watching a ""vampire movie"", but instead watching a budding young love relationship.  Don't get too comfortable however, there's enough blood to go around.

Finally, this question from the original movie of whether Abby (this movie) ne Eli (Swedish) is a boy or girl.  This film wisely removes the question.  The original leaves it open for discussion.  My research comes up with numerous theories, none of which made much sense to me.  Since this is an adaptation from a book, I checked it out.  In the book, the author says Eli is an androgynous boy from centuries ago castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman.  Yeah, that won't work for us Americanos.

4319563,5,B004BLJQOK,"No-spoilers review of ""Let me In"":

I'm going to help you decide whether you want to get this DVD, regardless of what I think of it. I will do so without telling you what happens.

I recommended this to a friend at church in passing. Later he saw my wife and asked her what it was about. She said ""It's a vampire movie."" He said ""That's all I need to know.""

This guy is a college professor, so he's pretty smart--and statistically he'd probably be right, given what most ""vampire movies"" are like. And yes, it is a vampire movie. But it's so different from most other vampire movies that leaving it at that is really misleading.

For one thing, most vampire movies are either romantic PG-13 Romeo and Julietty things aimed at 15 year old girls (of all ages), or blood-drenched R-rated splatterfests aimed at teenaged boys (of all ages).

This is neither. Hence the disgusted one-star reviews here by folks looking for one or the other--and who always assume the director was trying to make one or the other but was just too dumb to do so. Pretty funny, really--the arrogance of the mediocre.

Another source of misleadingment is the fact that this stars the same actress who played Hit Girl in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass-Three-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B002ZG9846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>"", Chlo Grace Moretz. In that film she plays an ultraviolent vigilante psycho killer (and does most of her own stunts BTW). But in ""Hugo,"" which came out recently, she plays a bookish, sunny, nonviolent girl. It's called acting. And Moretz has no interest in being typecast, so you can't use her being in a movie to conclude anything about a movie except that it will probably be different from the normal fare in some way. You can expect her to do her own stunts mostly--she trained for six months for her role in ""Kickass"" and now may be physically the strongest, most agile actress in her age range.

She is one reason to see ""Let me in."" She and Hailee Steinfeld (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit/dp/B003UESJME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit</a>&nbsp;are both serious about acting. And both, in their early teens, are doing mostly adult-oriented movies. Moretz has the added advantage of being destined to be the next Scarlett Johansson in a number of ways--looks, intelligence, gravitas and an arresting appearance--not just pretty.

I think Moretz wanted this role because it gave her the opportunity to do a layered performance. There's a scene where her character says ""I'm stronger than you think I am."" The other teen actresses who auditioned for the role said it as a brag, smiling smugly as they did so. Moretz stated it matter-of-factly, as a piece of information Owen needed to know, but with a whiff of great sadness, since that strength is part and parcel of what's different about her that means she will never be able to have a normal life. To grow up. To have a family. To not have to live on the run forever. So she's not bragging about her strength, because she's hundreds of years past thinking it was Kool--if she ever did.

Moretz put something into the character all those other beautiful, trained, skilled actresses didn't. She had a 360 view of Abby, while the others did not.

You'll like this movie if you like what Moretz liked about the script, the project. It's almost like a cross between one of those Sundance Festival movies and a Hollywood movie. It has the feel of a European art film with just a tad more vividness--a bit sparklier special effects, music, high-voltage talent (like the great character actor Richard Jenkins as Abby's gofer).

That's no surprise because it's adapted from the Swedish novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-the-Right-One-In-A-Novel-Paperback/dp/B002YICW7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let the Right One In: A Novel (Paperback)</a>&nbsp;and the Swedish movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-The-Right-One-In/dp/B001MYIXAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let The Right One In</a>.

So why not just see the original movie? Well, as it happens, I did see it first--and loved it. And not just me. The Rottentomatoes website aggregates critics' reviews and ratings, and the average of the 166 reviews it lists was a whopping 98%, while 44,000 viewers rated it an average of 90%. For ""Let Me In"" 205 critics gave it an average rating of a still very respectable 89% while 55,000 site viewers gave it 74%.

I think the lower average audience rating for ""Let Me In"" stemmed from misplaced loyalty to ""Let the right One In."" As if you have to choose one or the other. Team Abby or Team Eli. I don't know why this is, though. I've seen at least a dozen versions of Hamlet, and many bring something unique to the original play. Same here. An expert film critic could list a dozen aspects to each film that are better than the way the same aspect is executed in the other one.

And of course some people are strongly biased towards or against Hollywood. If you have a strong bias, you already know which you'll want to see. If you're like me you'll want to see both. I own both movies, and both have stuck with me, while most movies don't. Each, in its own way, is truly haunting.

Both films are vampire films that make most other vampire films seem juvenile, which is ironic, since the characters in ""Let me in""/""Let the right one in"" are juveniles.

In some ways the films are meditations on what it would be like to be a vampire, both for better and for worse; and metaphorically, for what it's like to be different from others in ways that make you superior in some ways, yet doomed to never get to experience the humble delights of ordinary human existence, and in that sense it's a study of normal human existence by seeing what it would be like to not have that.

""Let Me In"" definitely has a Hollywood flavor compared to the Swedish model. The vampire is prettier, the music more pervasive, the violence violenter, the landscape even bleaker (though not in all respects). Some find these differences extremely annoying. But I showed ""Let Me In"" to a pair of Russian intellectuals I know who had not seen the Swedish film or read the book, and they loved it. I don't know how they would have reacted if they'd seen ""Let the Right One In"" first, but I think it's significant that without that comparison they found ""Let Me In"" to be a real quality film.

There's a plus to seeing both versions--it's like seeing a story from the viewpoints of different characters, though both movies take third party Point of View.
But the emphases are distinct. Even where both films show the same scene it feels different. Don't believe reviewers here who say this is a shot for shot remake of the Swedish original. That just means they weren't looking closely enough.

One kind of person who won't like either movie is Good Guys vs. Bad Guys kind of people--people who think if you show the human side of the villain you're somehow excusing the villain's villainy. People like the fictional Inspector Javert in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Miserables-The-10th-Anniversary-Dream-Cast-in-Concert-at-London-s-Royal-Albert-Hall/dp/B00110K62U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall</a>--who was so unhinged by the escaped prisoner Jean Valjean's sparing his life that he committed suicide.

The vampires in these movies didn't ask to be vampires, don't want to be vampires, and would stop being vampires if there was a way out other than self-annihilation. And even if you don't normally watch vampire movies or horror movies you may want to watch this one. It's really more suspense than horror--a bit like Alfred Hitchcock.

Bottom line: this is a serious movie in a genre that's rarely serious. To put it another way, it's a serious take on a non-serious genre. It doesn't ask you to believe in vampires--only that if they existed, their existences would be as fraught and painful and unromantic as they're portrayed here.

SPOILERS FOLLOW--DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OR READ THE BOOK OR ONE OF THE FILMS

 Suppose you've seen ""Let the Right One In"" or read the book, which the Swedish movie hews to more closely.

If you expect the movie to copy the book, neither movie will please you, but the Swedish version will displease you less.

The critics generally agree that ""Let Me In"" is a fine movie, while ""Let the Right One In"" verges on greatness.

I love both and I see why the critics rate the Swedish version a tad higher--but there's one plot essential where the Swedish version is truer to the novel but falser to the audience. In the book and the Swedish movie, Eli is actually a castrated boy in drag, basically. In the American version Abby is a girl period. I think the Swedish original is trying to have it both ways, though, by casting a girl (Lina Leandersson) in the part--and not just a girl, but a girl who looks very much like a girl, and who acts like a girl. So while the Swedish version is technically truer to the novel, (a) I'm not seeing the movie as a visualization of the novel, and (b) the American version is more honest. It has a girl play a girl at least. If the Swedish movie had cast a boy to play Eli(as), that would have been true to the book, though it would have had far fewer viewers, including me. I'm glad neither movie was true to the book, frankly.

I wouldn't have disapproved of Eli being a boy in the movie, but I probably wouldn't have chosen to watch it either. And Eli/Abby's social isolation and disinterest in sex have nothing to do with Eli/Abby's gender, but rather by her age (12) and need to be an unwilling serial killer, which can be quite a buzz kill. So the rest of the story doesn't need this character to be a boy for the rest of the story to make sense.

And apart from this element, there are parts of the American movie that are better than the Swedish original, even though I grant that the reverse is also true (especially how the woman dies in the Swedish version, and how Eli spares the life of one kid in the pool scene, the visual of Eli scaling the side of the hospital, and the visual of what happens to Eli when (s)he enters a home without permission). But when Owen asks Abby what is she if she's not a girl, Abby says ""I'm nothing,"" while Eli just stares at him with those Japanese anime character huge eyes. Abby's response is more profound, and her being a girl makes the reason for her saying ""I'm nothing"" deeper--you don't need gender bending to feel isolated if you're a vampire. Honest. Being a vampire is plenty!

Also, it's absolutely fascinating to see Chlo Grace Moretz' rendition of Abby/Eli. She didn't see the Swedish movie or read the novel before making the movie, so this is her independent interpretation (ditto the boy). It's really different from Leandersson's, yet both performances are deep--truly impressive from actors so young. And the difference in their appearances contribute to making the role different.

So instead of trying to decide which is better--which here is like asking if a pear is better than bacon--I love having two unique interpretations of a fine story to watch.

The negative reviews of ""Let Me In"" by ""Let the Right One In"" fans--and vice versa--show that there's a Team Abby and a Team Eli...and Team Can't We All Just Get Along? which I belong to. You probably won't enjoy ""Let me in"" if you regard every difference as automatically inferior, and every similarity as automatically a needless copy, and if you feel superior to Hollywood movies in general.

I should point out that both films end the same way, so it's not like they tacked one of those happy Hollywood fantasy endings onto this story. And I should add that the author of the book has endorsed both versions. That doesn't prove both versions are good, but it does cast an interesting light on those who disparage ""Let Me In"" because they think it betrays the book.

I haven't addressed the subtitle issue because dubbing is unacceptable to me in all circumstances (except when used for humorous effect), and anyone who has the sensitivity to enjoy ""Let the Right One In"" must be able to deal with subtitles.

You'll like ""Let Me In"" alongside ""Let the Right One In"" especially if you're a serious filmgoer and like to see, for example, different versions of Shakespeare plays.

Lastly, I think people on Team Eli believe that the American version is stealing sales from the Swedish original. Personally I'd argue that the exact opposite is true. ""Let Me In"" will garner viewers who wouldn't see the Swedish original anyway because they don't like subtitles and dubbing, and/or because they prefer more American production values and style, as I described in the first part of this review. At the same time a certain % of ""Let Me In"" viewers will then want to see how the Swedish version did it, because it's a good enough story to justify multiple interpretations.

Wouldn't it be interesting to see how Hayao Miyazaki would interpret this story as an animated film? I think it would be magnificent, given how wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;is...",1324684800,3,13498,4.996436525612472

4319566,4,B004BLJQOK,"Recently vampires have come to us as highly romanticized teenagers where supernatural elements have become metaphors of the angst and alienation felt by teenagers as they try to come to terms with who they are. ""Let Me In"" takes the idea of the teenaged vampire and adds a little gritty realism to the mix and explores what it may be like when the girl next door is a vampire.

""Let Me In"" is based on the Swedish film and book, ""Let the Right One In"", while I hear the original is creepier and more subtle, but I didn't see the original so review is based only on my viewing of ""Let Me In.""

Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a loner, bullied and beaten up at school, at home he has violent fantasies that border on the early makings of a serial killer. When a girl his own age, Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), moves into the apartment building next door, and he only sees her at night, he becomes intrigued with her and as they become friends, he discovers her secret that she is a vampire.

""Let Me In"" definitely goes in for a more subtle, creepier realistic horror than either a romanticized view or a strictly gore-fest of ever increasing bloody vampire kills, and this is not to say ""Let Me In"" doesn't have its moments, like when Abby attacks a police officer and Owen has a chilling choice to make. ""Let Me In"" walks the line of the vampire movie and a dark tale of love. This subtly is even more surprising because ""Let Me In"" was written and directed by Matt Reeves who directed ""Cloverfield"" which isn't very subtle.

The DVD includes commentary with writer/director Matt Reeves, a behind the scenes documentary, ""From the Inside: A Look at the Making of Let Me In"", a featurette on the special effects, and deleted scenes.",1323561600,5,1723,4.477707006369426

I think a lot of people will find the movie rather slow-moving (ESPECIALLY those expecting the ""usual"" vampire genre). I personally didn't find it too slow at all but just right for the relationship between Owen & Abby to connect & grow & become established.

One final note: For me, the most horrific scenes were those depicting the bullying of Owen by classmates. That is NOT a criticism of the film at all. It was realistic and what's truly horrific is that bullying is a terrible fact of life.",1323216000,,752,4.548148148148148

""Inside the cover of this book is a fantastic vampire story, but either something got lost in the translation or the editors missed a lot of opportunities to ratchet up the tension.

4319576,4,B004BLJQOK,"""Let Me In"" - 4 1/2 = Minor Masterpiece

""Let Me In"" (2010) is the American remake of the Norwegian original, ""Let the Right One In"" (2008). It is about how two misfits find each other. Owen, (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is terrorized by bullies at school, & fantasizes about revenge by playing out his fears when he is alone. His parents are divorced, & Owen just seems to not fit in anywhere, at school or at home. The other, Abby. Abby has just moved in next door, with who Owen at first thinks is her father, Richard Jenkins (who's role is called, ""the Father""), who actually is not Abby's father at all, but day time protector & provider of food, namely, blood, for Abby is a Vampire. She needs someone to watch over her during the day & to go out hunting for her at night, though you'll see later in the film, that Abby is perfectly capable of hunting down her own food. So the film starts.

""Let Me In"" is a tragic horror film, the tragedy of loneliness, the tragedy of being stuck with who you are & what you are, of not fitting in. For Owen, it's loneliness, being weak, being an outcast. For Abby, it's being a Vampire & knowing she'll never stop being one. Abby will continue to live on, while one human companion after another takes care of her needs. It is the tragedy of knowing that the one person she selects as her companion will eventually die, & before he does, she'll have to find another to replace him. For her companion, it is knowing someday all this will happen, & when it does, the pain of desertion, replacement, the pain of knowing it is over. Both film's orchestrate these themes well, but I feel the remake does a better job of it. The acting, directing & editing seems to be quite a bit stronger, & the cast is perfect, but at the same time, the original film is dubbed, & that can contribute to how well a film seems acted & translates it's story to a foreign audience. In this case, the American version seems more intimate, tragic,  just by facial expressions & body language alone. This is especially evident in ""the Father"" character. Richard Jenkins exudes tragedy in just about every scene he is in. His eyes speak a million atrocious tragedies that he has committed. His eyes speak a great sadness in knowing his time is about over. His, is a greatly improved role & performance over the original. Same has to be said about Owen's part, Kodi Smit McPhee was born for this role. His eyes speak great sadness, but also, great fear, the fear of the world. His counterpart, ""Oscar,"" in the original film, shows much anger, but his role & performance is nowhere as deep, as sad, as multi-dimensional as Owens. Chloe Grace Moretz, as Abby, brings more tragedy & sadness to her role than her counterpart, ""Eli,"" in the original. This can especially be witnessed in scenes with ""the Father,"" especially the hospital scene. Both movies had the same scene, but the American version just takes it so much deeper. You can feel their pain, you can see their pain. In the original, it seemed just like a repeated scenario for Ali. There was a little sadness, but then it was all over in a blink of an eye, without much remorse, not so with the emotional punch of the remake.

Both films are horror films, but here, the American version has the edge again. When Abby hunts her prey, she is absolutely feral, she looks the part, due to superior make up. She moves like the part, due to superior special effects. She is the part, as she ravenously feeds on her victims. One thing though that is missing in the remake, is the more overtly sexual relationship between Ali & Oscar, where it is only hinted at in the remake, the original is fairly frank about it, especially in the scene that Ali puts on Oscar's mother's dress, & he peers in to the room, there is a quick flash of frontal nudity. There is also a scene with a long kiss between the two.  Europe has a more worldly view on sexuality between children, where America does not blink an eye seeing a child frenetically feeding off her victims, but would be uncomfortable viewing a long kiss, let alone, nudity, between the two child actors.

Another very important part of these movies are the bullies of both Owen & Oscar. The original film bullies were just weak, as compared to the brutal masochistic nature of the American film. There is a scene where both Owen & Oscar get whipped with what looks like a metal radio antenna. In the Norwegian film, as Oscar gets whipped, it looks more like love taps when compared to the American film, as Owen gets flogged, brutally flogged, you can feel every lash of the antenna. Another is where Owen gets whipped in the face with a towel in the boys locker room after gym class. You can feel that towel whipping his face, then if that is not enough, the bullies knock him to the floor & beat on him until he urinates in his pants out of terror. Yes, there is no comparison of the bullies here between the two films, the American version wins hands down, plus Owen is terrified even to make eye contact with his foes, where Oscar seems to be oblivious of them half the time.

Both films are very good to great additions to the horror genre, they add depth, terror, horror, sadness, & loneliness, to a rather oversaturated time for Vampire movies, that are frankly, quite lame by comparison. A drop of fresh blood, just when the Vampire movie needed it the most, in this post ""Twilight"" era.

4319577,4,B004BLJQOK,"First off, you should know that this is a re-make of an original Swedish film, ""Lt den rtte komma in"". Do not let this dissuade you from watching this, but you should see the original as well.

The original contains much less gratuitous violence, where as the American version seems to revile in it. This might be because an American perspective and expectations have demanded this of films for sometime. The Swedish film did contain violence, but in a way that left something to the imagination, and gave the general sense that the violence did not drive the story. A glaring difference in the sensibilities of American vs Swedish audiences accounts for there being much more nudity in the Swedish, which had to be worked around in the American. There is a point where having seen this almost shot for shot remake in the Swedish first, made some of the American dialogue seem pointless, were it not for the prior knowledge of what made certain lines pertinent to the story. There are other points however, that are made clearer in the American, such as the importance of puzzles, and who exactly the older man is. Either way, the strength of the story stands for itself, and can more than endure these glaring differences. The fact that the story deals with the mythology of vampires rather than out and out blood and violence is a fresh breath in the genre. The chilling aspects of this film are not what is normally used as a mechanism in most vampire films. The question of ""letting someone in"" is used to perhaps its fullest effect. Is one letting the vampire into their home, or to their heart? In the end, my opinion is that it doesn't matter what audience the screenplay is written for, therefore, see both this, and the Swedish. They are different enough to be entertaining so you can watch even though you know what happens, but you are rewarded with a different perspective.

This is a film that will entertain you on the surface, but also challenges you to think deeper about what is really happening. From a purely entertainment point of view the movie works, yet on a critical perspective, the story takes on much more of a haunting feel, and you may feel completely different about the events and characters after multiple viewings.  You can see this as a coming of age / romantic film, but deeper down, it has chilling implications for its characters. Rarely does a film function on two levels so completely. You will appreciate this film much more if you watch the original ""Lt den rtte komma in"" and I strongly urge you to do so.",1319932800,4,2547,4.643015521064301
4319578,2,B004BLJQOK,"A fan of the original film and novel, I initially had no real desire to see this one. I read so many positive reviews (and the fact it came up on instant view from my online movie provider)that I decided to give this one a try. Here are some of my questions/issues:

Initially, why the remake? Not sure. The original film is also a very recent film and is available both dubbed and with subtitles. They are both period pieces in a sense, so their is no reason to update it. I initially read Matt Reeves pay lip service to the original only to go on and say he could do better (not in so few words). Seems like hubris to me. I honestly feel Matt Reeves never understood what the original film was about.

As a film, on it's own, it is just uneven. I know some reviewers complain that the comparisons to the original is unfair but truth be told, as a separate entity this film just falls flat, although not due to the performance of the two leads. The pacing felt off, their relationship felt forced at first and the aforementioned manipulation/sympathy dynamic just didn't play out as horror and I felt we were supposed to be cheering for Abby and Owen although we shouldn't be, as Abby certainly was no victim in this film.

As a comparison? The original lacks (as far as I know) any CGI work and everything is done on camera with minimal effects (***Edit*** Have re-watched the original, the cats attacking scene was CGI). Many of the original scenes play out and I really felt witness to the events unfolding before me. This version, the CGI stuck out in this supposedly straight forward film and the hospital burning scene felt like it was crow-barred in to have some action (although this scene is in the original, it plays out well as part of a sub-plot). I felt like I was watching a movie, which of course, I was but an intimate story like this should take you away from that point of view. This movie just didn't do that nearly as effectively as the original. There is some good here. Some of the scenes were very well done but, sadly, no more so than they appeared in the original which to say, I simply mean Matt Reeves few good scenes were just carbon copies of the originals. Finally, and already mentioned, Abby was no victim in this film. We are meant to see her as victim because she is a twelve year old girl, but she is clearly not through her actions and behaviors. Eli and Osker, at the core of the original, were both victims that found each other in a sea of garbage, poor Owen is just the next benefactor.

The main issue is (as I have read from other reviewers)that Matt Reeves changed the fundamental basis of the story. Not only did he make Abby far less sympathetic but the film tries to continue to create sympathy despite the fact that we should be horrified that Abby is continuing to bully/seduce/entrap Owen in much more subtle ways than the school bullies. Although Abby cared for her old benefactor, this is also another huge departure from the original. Without going into detail, Eli was as much a victim in many ways as Oskar was, unlike the Abby/Owen dynamic. While this makes a better 'horror' film, it ignores what the original was about, not to mention the audio/soundtrack cues really played against this.

Some of the logic lapses of the lone cop character were just silly. I understand Matt Reeves was trying to compact the story but it ended up ultimately hurting (in my opinion) it overall, making the film much more conventional, something the original film and book cannot be accused of.

Ultimately it is my hope that anyone interested in this film will seek out the original and be exposed to a far better interpretation of the novel and, in turn, seek that out as well.",1319846400,11,3719,4.485967503692762
4319579,1,B004BLJQOK,"The following is an explanation as to why I prefer Let The Right one In to Let me In.  Many people think it's pretentiousness to prefer the Foreign film to the domestically made one but really, it's not.  It simply was a bad a film.

1. I don't like the CGI. I see no point in adding blood with CGI. It looks awful.

2. I do not like the implication that the boy is to be the next henchman (or whatever term you want to use). It goes against the original novel and the original theme of rare and true unconditional love without sex. The purist and most innocent love through darkness. That was at the heart of the original story and what made it so endearing.  Also to claim Eli had known her/ his henchman since that henchman was a boy is wrong. He's too bungling and incompetent.  He clearly is not experienced at killing and disposing of the body so how could he have been doing this his entire adult life? That version of the character in the remake does not make sense.

3. The setting of the remake felt wrong. I like atmosphere and I like the unearthly quality of vampires and you lose some of that without the bare footed child in a t-shirt walking in snow and you can't see her breath but you see everyone else's.

4. Making it clear that Eli was really a boy was important because it was the result of that mutilation that Eli was anti-social, avoided human society, was clearly awkward and shunned society with it's gender roles. Eli did not trust the outside world because of his secrets and because of what he suffered and some of that was lost. It takes away from the child vampire's tragedy. And the solidification of the fact that their love was NOT sexual but something far deeper.
  I think it's kind of depressing that we Americans can accept monsters but we can't accept that the child vampire was really a boy?  The fact that being a blood thirsty monster seems ""more acceptable"" to the audience than the idea of the child being a boy says something is really wrong with our society right now.

5. I feel the Swedish actress was simply a better actor in general. The girl who played Abby is now in Dark Shadows and I've been watching interviews with her and she's spacy and acts... well, kind of high...

6. I just tend to prefer films that follow the original source material better.

7. This was the first good vampire film since Twilight. And by ""since Twilight"" I do NOT mean that Twilight is good, but rather the first good vampire film since the whole annoying fad started!

8. The remake disappointed me for another reason as I expect more atmosphere from the recently revived Hammer company and they let me down.

9. I don't like finding out that the reason the title was changed was ""The original title is too long for Americans."" (real reasoning). That offends me. Especially when the original title was based on an English language song by Morrisey and the song definitely suits the movie. And the follow up short story is named for the next line of the song, Let the Old Dreams Die.

  The interpret it that OsKar / Owen (what's the point of changing the name?  We have Oscars here in the US) is the next henchman hurts the film and the entire theme of the movie that love, actual unconditional affection, without need of sex, can bloom in the strangest of situations. That was at the heart of the story. For the boy and for the monster. And if you deliberately strip that out for the sake of your ""interpretation"" the entire message and meaning of the movie is lost just to appease contemporary and cruel cynicism.  It's wrong to completely twist the very heart and meaning of the story to appeal a cold, modern interpretation based on the disturbing fact that people today have become too cynical to accept the notion that love can bloom anywhere at ny time with anyone. The heart of the story was that Oskar could love despite the fact that Eli was a monster and not really female and that Eli would love to a degree of fierce protectiveness she/he never gave to the henchman. To dismiss this and turn the film into something colder and shallow. And to be honest the mindset that does this... disgusts me.

  The writer of the original story said what it's about and wrote a follow up story to prove the way it's supposed to be seen.  He says that Eli eventually makes Oskar a vampire after they finish the blood pact when they get off the train. To act as if he's wrong about the outcome of his own characters is like telling a child they are wrong about their own imaginary friend. That it's not a pink rabbit but rather a green bear.

  Watch the original, skip Let me In.",1319760000,29,4611,4.418439716312057

I will re-write this review later, but at the moment I'm kind of in shock. Once you see ""Edit:"" toward the bottom then I will have finally given this film a proper/accurate review. For now even tho I have seen it several times I am mainly speaking about the characters and such, and it's just rambling unless you really want to know about the Actors/Actresses as I have not been able to think of the words to put together to describe the film, or Chloe's acting ability.
Chloe Moretz... That girl can ACT! She is one awesome little Vampire in this film, and her emotional/facial expressions are so accurate that it's kind of surreal seeing someone near her age with her abilities. She even did all of her stunts in ""Kick-AXX"", and that did not look like an easy task.

I guess as boring as this review seems, I really connected with the characters. It has it's own way of being REALLY sweet & a cute film. Not ""cute"" in the small way, but cute as in I am buying this in Blu even tho I've seen it (I believe) 5 times.

The boy in this film was just as spot on with his character as Chloe, but Chloe adds something unique. The Son of ""Jack"" in the show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B0036EH3WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray</a>] was the bad guy in this film. That disappointed me quite a bit to see them toss him into a selfish & mean roll. He has all of the potential to be a great Actor, but I think he may have needed to not play this roll because of how people can permanently view a new Actor or Actress from 1 bad roll, and see them as that bad (or good) person forever. He's going to have to go toward a division to show he is kind, and not arrogant before jumping into such a hateful roll. It wasn't his fault of course. I wouldn't have said ""No"" either if they asked me to play the part. I wouldn't have had the patience and would think ""If I pass up this roll I may never get another again"". So, I understand, but it stinks they've put him in a position where they literally may have to let him age for 3-5 more years before putting him in another film so the audience will have a fresh take on his Character. I believe he will succeed in the industry, but may need to be careful about which rolls to take. Chloe showed her good and sweet sides before she tried to show the audience ""Profession"" in the manner of some films. A lot of people will be disgusted to hear her speak with a bad mouth in another film in particular.

She is truly a Star. Hollywood isn't about to let Chloe go. She is probably a Gold Mine to the industry. It seems she is the lead actress in every film she is in now.

I'll stop rambling, because I really am still a bit speechless ATM to explain about this film directly other than I'm genuinely amazed by this girl's acting abilities, and the ability to be so powerful with her acting that she can turn a very bad film Very good.
Watching her interview I thought ""THAT'S why she seems so down to earth, to me!"" when she mentioned she was born in Georgia until Chloe's Brother was accepted into an acting school in New York, and her and her Mom talked about acting and Chloe just went and did it. She had 0 experience before her first film in any acting scenario. She makes an Alabamian proud :)

I genuinely believe no one could have possibly done as spot on of a job as she did in ""Taken"". Dakota is sweet, but the industry has gauged her directly at very melodramatic rolls. Lots of screaming in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-the-Worlds-Blu-ray/dp/B003BJO8KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of the Worlds [Blu-ray</a>], and she was absolutely awesome in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-On-Fire-Blu-ray/dp/B000XSWVFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man On Fire [Blu-ray</a>] with Denzell Washington, but then again Dakota was put in a position where a lot of areas are trying to show her ability to act out pure sadness. That's great, and she did great, but they did put her in a roll that had quite a bit of whining in this one as well. Also, this was not her fault, and I genuinely don't think another girl at that time could have possibly played the entire roll so well. (All of my spelling is probably wrong. I apologize)
Then again we could say the same about Chloe, because Chloe was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass-Three-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B002ZG9846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;& if you aren't prepared to see a little girl speak like an adult with a dirty mouth then you won't think of Chloe as sweet.

Watch the interview of Chloe on the subject film ""Kick-XXX"" thru youtube to get a better understanding of her personality. Chloe doesn't just smile, or cry, or laugh, act sweet, or mean...

4319582,5,B004BLJQOK,"I will start by saying I am not a fan of vampire films at all. The concept of vampires has no appeal to me, and I find them to be fairly dull subject matter. Though while perusing Netflix one boring evening, I saw 'Let Me In' listed, and thought I'd give it a viewing just to kill some time.

I was initially intrigued by the setting being in 1983, as I'm very fond of the early 80's. It's not saturatingly obvious throughout the film, but just enough to remind you. The main character is an awkward boy named Owen who lives with his alcoholic mother in a broken home. His father is negligent and absent, which adds to the melancholy of the boy's situation. At school, Owen is the target of a group of bullies who harass him without cause, purely for self-amusement. I immediately identified with Owen and all of the aspects of his life, and it sucked me personally and directly into the film.

When Abby moves in next door to Owen, the two of them begin a reluctant friendship that becomes of great significance. Abby is a vampire, but it's not the usual black cape and fangs scenario. It is depicted as a sort of incurable disease that she must live with while trying to survive in the shadows. Having been through her own share of challenges throughout her unknown years alive, Abby encourages Owen to stand up for himself against his bullies, regardless of how intimidating it may be and despite the possible consequences. And when Owen does have the strength to fight back, the liberation comes with the greater price of the increased harassment, as shown in the final showdown. But Owen has in Abby what all of us harassed formerly awkward school kids wished we had back in the day; a hero to come and put a final stop to it all.

The actor who plays Owen was the perfect choice. His frail appearance, bleak home life and personal sadness are greatly affective, and the viewer's heart goes out to him. Being the odd kid, this naturally gives him the open mindedness to embrace some of the more alarming aspects of his newfound neighbor and friend. The relationship that Owen and Abby develop is bitter sweet. They are outcasts who were lucky enough to find each other, but will never be able to live a ""normal"" life. The final scene of the film is both very sad and very sweet, and always chokes me up.

'Let Me In' is far more story based than what some may expect from a horror film, if you even want to call it that since it's more of a drama. Its appeal may be to a niche audience similar to me, as the director confirms in the bonus features that both he and the author of the original story were able to relate because they were also bullied as kids. The sad fact is that the bullying doesn't stop at the playground, and some of us have continued to encounter the occasional schoolyard bullies in adult situations. Like Owen, I've learned over the years to stand up for myself and fight, regardless of the potential consequences or being outnumbered. I view 'Let Me In' as a film that encourages the oddballs out there to try to make the best of their situations, despite negative odds. It's a beautifully filmed and executed movie that will have a great and lasting impact on some, while others just will not understand it. It's satisfying that story based films of this quality and character can still surface from time to time.",1319241600,8,3342,4.482758620689655
4319583,5,B004BLJQOK,"When I first read the reviews ""Chillingly real"" I didn't really understand what they meant until I watched the movie. It was exactly as the critics said ""Chillingly real."" This movie had me asking where Director Matt Reeves was taking me. I have really come to appreciate Matt Reeves' ability to capture human behavior and add a twist that makes it seem like the supernatural could truly exist. The movie played on my emotions where I develop a sense of protectiveness towards Abby and Owen. I know that what she is and what she does is wrong but I accepted her choices and actions for my want for her to survive.

Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby) do an amazing and impressive job acting. Really good movie.

I did not purchase this movie it was available on Netflix Watch Instantly. I have watched it again because I have enjoyed the actors abilities to get me to fall in love with them.

4319584,5,B004BLJQOK,"For those who have never seen the original, like me, this was one of the best dramatic horror films produced in decades. While it has gory parts, it focuses more on the relationships between the characters, in a sympathetic perspective because of the innocence of the two 12 year old characters, except of course the one hasn't been 12 in many decades. Real vampire thrills, versus romanticized versions in recent years, going beyond even Anne Rice's version. If one has seen The Grudge, one may recognize the movements from that in this, the girl moves creepily, attacking in fast forward speed with jerky inhuman effects. The acting is incredibly great, the quality of special effects, visual & sound all excellent production values. Thrilling & suspenseful without being a nail-biting, cover your eyes kind of movie, yet never once boring or slow. Several plot twist surprises keep the film from being at all predictable, unless of course you have seen the original & know what is coming. I doubt I've ever seen two more beautiful actors than the 2 children in this movie, I could not take my eyes off the boy especially, but both were perfect. I would not recommend this to children under 18, the PG rating is not correct or consistent with other such film's ratings, at the very least parental guidance & discernment is called for before allowing a younger child to view this.

When we watched the American version, it made no sense and even he said that.

A lot of my associates who I don't like said that it was scary.  What?  A girl killing a man just for his blood?  I really don't like to down this because, in my opinion, it would've been decent if he didn't show me the book and the Swedish movie before I saw this.

4319587,5,B004BLJQOK,"The 2010 film Let Me In is by far the most successful and sophisticated of the slew of horror films to debute in the past couple of years (e.g., Case 39, Insidious, and Paranormal Activity 2). It is also, I believe, the best vampire film ever made! (In contrast, the popular ""Twilight"" series is mere cinematic fodder for adolescent movie-goers suffering from a severe case of teen angst!) Let Me In, moreover, is both a vampire and a coming-of-age film, which subtly - and disturbingly - blends both genres. The fact that the central protagonists are twelve years-old (one of whom is a vampire!) adds another ""turn of the screw"" (to borrow novelist Henry James's famous phrase) to the palpable tension and apprehension present in the film.

Let Me In has been criticized for following too closely the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In, which, in turn, was a close adaptation of the Gothic novel of the same name by Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist. In my opinion, this is hardly a ""fault."" It is doubtful that any director could have improved upon the plot line of the masterful narrative framework established by Lindqvist. Instead, director Matt Reeves (of Cloverfield fame) focused his attention on the film's deeply moving characterizations, eerie and oppressive mood, and thoroughly frightening special effects! Indeed, Let Me In is, I believe, far superior to its Swedish predecessor in creating a truly terrifying horror film worthy of the genre!

The ultimate key to the success of Let Me In, however, is the stellar performances of the film's two adolescent stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chlo Grace Moretz. Smit-McPhee portrays Owen perfectly as a lonely, troubled, slightly neurotic, but completely sympathetic lad who is unrelentingly tormented by older bullies. Moretz's characterization of Abby, who is Owen's new mysterious and evasive neighbor, is equally engrossing; she provides a subtle mixture of innocence, malice, and a hint of seductiveness, all of which draw Owen inexorably to her. The personal ""chemistry"" that results between the two adolescents only adds to the power of their performances.

The conclusion of Let Me In is extremely unsettling and even a bit nihilistic. Yet, one is left to wonder, is the fate of young Owen as Abby's new ""caretaker"" any worse than the life he was leading in the land of the ""living?"" His home life was ravaged by his parents' divorce, leaving Owen to live with an alcoholic and self-destructive mother; he existed in a friendless world of extreme isolation and loneliness; and school bullies constantly terrorized Owen, even to the point of trying to kill him! Truly a thought-provoking and disturbing ending to a nearly flawless horror film! (Check out the trailer for Let Me In, which is accessible from the Amazon product page!)",1314489600,5,2800,5.043196544276458
4319588,5,B004BLJQOK,"One of the best movies I saw last year was ""Let The Right One In"", a Norwegian vampire movie that was bleak and arty and basically about the morally ambiguous relationship between two twelve-year-old kids. I walked into this one five minutes late, which I normally don't do, but I thought it would be okay because the credits usually eat up five minutes anyway. But in this case, the movie had started already, at a scene that I knew was halfway through the film. I thought to myself ""did I come in one hour and five minutes late instead of just five minutes late?"" But what the director does is he starts at an important scene from the middle, then jumps back two weeks.

The film is a very faithful remake of the original, and it's always interesting to see how the director's going to stage any given scene. The one thing that is very different is that neither of Owen's divorcing parents are ever seen; the father is only heard on the phone, and the mum, who he lives with, is only seen from the shoulders down, heightening the sense of Owen's isolation and loneliness. No adult befriends Owen, and his classmates are either indifferent or hostile. Owen's moral lapse comes out strongly in this film, and he's so happy to finally have a companion that he forgets that Abby is a heartless killer.

One complaint is the soundtrack, which is too moody, and when it turns moody it projects that something bad is going to happen. I don't remember much music in the original at all. But since its intention is to make the viewers tense, it sure does its job well.

Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, the young boy who was in The Road, and he was 13 at the time it was filmed. Abby is played by Chlo Grace Moretz, who was Hit Girl in the movie Kick Ass, and she was also 13 when the film was made.

I had seen the original Swedish film Let the Right One In some time ago therefore I did not remember all the details.  Still, it was as if I was watching the same movie again.

If you like the vampire movies, it is a very good movie.  One caveat: it is not a typical slasher horror movie.  It is more realistic, which makes it more scary.

It is amazing to me how much detail exists out there about vampires, a made-up-creature.  Who comes up with all this stuff?  You have to invite them into your house, otherwise they can't come it.  The sunshine will catch them on fire.  They have to drink blood to live.  Only silver bullets will kill them.  They never age.  It really is endless.  And, of course everybody knows these *facts*.

4319590,3,B004BLJQOK,"Seeing Let the Right One In two weeks before Let Me In makes for an interesting comparison. The original film, Let the Right One In, was an adaptation of a book that had complicated, uncomfortable themes that made it a challenge to adapt to the big screen.  This gave the Swedish film some rough edges: a prelude to a retrospective montage that never happened, Eli's androgyny, and the potentially unpleasant relationship between Eli and her ""ghoul"" (to use a Vampire RPG term).

The androgynous nature of Eli changes her interactions with Oskar.  The mysterious relationship between Eli and her guardian let the viewer come to his or her own conclusions. Although Let the Right One In wasn't perfect, its flaws made it a better film. Let Me In smoothes over all these rough edges, for better or worse.

The beautiful and deadly Chloe Grace Moretz (excellent as Hit Girl in Kick-Ass and equally breathtaking here) is Abby, an unearthly little girl who doesn't seem bothered by the cold, loves puzzles, and whose appearance veers from pretty to bedraggled. She befriends outcast Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, just as vulnerable here as he was in The Road), who dreams of stabbing the bullies who harass him.

The subtle but important difference between the two films pivots on what the bullies call Owen (Oskar in the original): ""little pig."" In the American version, Owen is called a little girl.  The gender appellation shifts the movie's focus from two lonely souls finding each other across the gulf of death to two Romeo and Juliet-style prepubescent tweens discovering romance. This doesn't lessen the emotional impact of Let the Right One, but it does change the film's tone significantly.

With the exception of the cat sequence, which is missing entirely from Let Me In, Let the Right One In has creepier special effects.  Whether it's Eli/Abby's eyes flashing like a cat, the wreck of Hakan/Thomas' (Richard Jenkins) acid-ravaged face, or Virginia's (Sasha Barrese) horrible conflagration, Let Me In's digital effects look subpar in comparison. For some reason, all of Abby's attacks are handled digitally, which makes them surreal.

Even the ending, which is almost a frame-for-frame reproduction, lacks the gut punch of the original by ratcheting back the gore. Let Me In fixes many discrepancies in Let the Right One In, but in doing so seems to be embarrassed by its Swedish roots.  But if you've never seen the original, Let Me In is an excellent substitute.",1313798400,2,2466,4.992682926829269

4319592,3,B004BLJQOK,"Remember Gus van Sant's 1998 attempt to remake Psycho by filming a scene-by-scene reconstruction?  Let Me In is as misbegotten.

As yet another fan of the Swedish original, I was honestly prepared to like this version.  When done correctly, with imagination, a remake can be an entertaining opportunity to explore variations in character and presentation.

Unfortunately, though beautifully photographed and well acted, this production is, for those who have seen Let The Right One In, flat and disappointing.

Much of the appeal of LTROI was from the unusual setting.  Watching it, you could feel the chill of the outdoors scenes in the soles of your feet and the tip of your nose.  In this version, the snow just looks like what it is: plastic.

Chloe Moretz, as she proved in Kick Ass (another problematic film in which she was the standout performer), is a gifted and appealing actor, but does not have the eerie and haunting qualities of Lina Leandersson. She has now delivered one exceptional and one at least commendable performance in two otherwise weak vehicles.

I think what sealed my opinion was the end credits: ""Directed and written for the screen by Matt Reeves.""  It seems specious to claim such credit when you are, with very few exceptions, slavishly copying the scenes and set pieces of another movie.

If you have not seen Let The Right One In, find subtitles off-putting or European cinema more of an exercise than entertainment, by all means watch this version.  In and of itself, it is a unique story.

I wish that I could have viewed Let Me In without the bias of having seen the original. Perhaps it would then indeed seem the horror classic the sound bite reviews on the cover claim it to be.",1313712000,2,1718,4.783050847457627

4319594,5,B004BLJQOK,"One of my top three vampire movies of all time:  Curtis' Dracula starring Jack Palance and Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre.  Unlike the other two movies, there is no historical context to the characters and story.  It's a movie about a 12 year old girl (vampire) who's been twelve for a very long time and a twelve year old boy who is lonely, facing his parents' divorce and the local bullies at school.  The director captured the mid 1980s well:  clothing, music, arcade/video games, etc and yet, there is a timeless quality to the film. The scene with the rubik cube is just wonderful and Owen's delight at finding the completed cube (and possible new friend) the next morning is special.  The two young actors are truly the stars of the film and their interactions  with each other elevates this film to another level beyond being just another vampire movie.  The film contains some scenes of intense but subtle violence and yet, some very tender scenes.  The relationship between Abby and Owen is a symbiotic one and yet, there is an underlying current of affection, dare one say love.  They both need each other for very different reasons and yet, it comes off so natural in the film.  I found the director's emphasis on Abby's feet a clever and unique aspect of the film.  The supporting cast is excellent.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I first watched this film but after a couple of viewings, my appreciation for it has only grown.

Now I can see why King calls this the best horror film in twenty years.  Not as a knock on the film, it plays like a middle school version of ""Carrie"".  Director Matt Reeves expertly establishes time and place by placing the film in 1983 snow-swept Los Alamos, New Mexico.  This creates a claustrophobic feeling that enhances the fright factor.  He's ably abetted by the terrific performances of his juvenile leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee as the tormented young boy and Chloe Grace Moretz as the ageless vampire trapped in a twelve year old girl's body.  Smit-McPhee and Moretz, belying their years, make the love between their characters palpable and believable.  You'll shed a tear from time to time even if one of the lovers would rather cut your throat than embrace you.  I find it interesting that Reeves juxtaposes their relationship with that of Romeo and Juliet.  It's kind of an apt one that would almost portend doom for the most unlikely pairing.

Ok, it is more horror than romance, and the romance is of a very tender age of 12 years, and stays appropriate to the age. No Lolita vampirism here, no precocious liberties either. More holding hands and shy smiles. And the young lady shows her horror mettle in a sufficiently creepy way to keep you interested.
Very good remake of a Swedish hit movie after a novel called Let the Right One In.
Recommendable if you appreciate the occasional better horror.",1312070400,4,570,4.490384615384615
4319597,4,B004BLJQOK,"Most child actors make their big break starring in children's movies.  Chloe Moretz has done the exact opposite; though she has a string of children's movies on her resume already, she has made her name among the American movie-going public by starring in a bloody horror flick and a vulgar, bloody action flick; both of which are rated R.  And to her credit, both of these movies are probably among the best releases of 2010.  This one, a remake of a Swedish film of a similar name and plot, has Chloe portraying a 12-year old female vampire who develops a relationship with a bullied boy in a small town somewhere in America during the dead of winter.  Her acting is quite impressive, with scenes of romance, action, suspense and drama mixed together.  Her acting is accompanied by good acting by the rest of the cast, most of which, like her, are relative unknowns in Hollywood.  The movie itself is scary and entertaining to watch.  Overall, one of the better films of 2010.  One final comment about her breakout role; she is following a successful path; Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore and Christian Bale made their names by starring in rated-R movies as children.",1311724800,3,1166,4.737623762376238

I thought a certain character, and I'm sure those of you who have seen it know who I'm talking about, was going to die at the end, but the ending surprised me. At first, judging from the previews, I thought it was going to be a horror film, but to me it ended up being more of a suspense film. A jumpy scene or two, but all in all it was great.

And that is exactly what happened...That is exactly what happened to many other people which I just found out. Why? I have no idea. But I will say this...

Let Me In is the example of why you should not judge a movie by its cover. Find yourself lost in the characters of Abby and Owen as their relationship progresses and intensifies. Owen struggles to connect with anybody including his parents who unknowingly neglect him. He is lonely and bullied harshly at school. Watching Kodi play this role is just so emotional. Just look at his face during the bathroom scene. How can you not feel for that kid?

Chloe plays Abby, the 12 year old vampire. She and Owen connect and understand one another through not just their age similarities but what they've been through. It's a beautiful thing, yet it's also uncomfortable knowing that Abby is more than she seems... in a bad way. The only happy thing these characters have are each other. It's deeper than romance. It's finding someone who gets you, regardless of who or what they are and what they've done or been through.

This movie will haunt you for days after watching. Maybe not everyone, but the few who are will end up reading the book and watching the original film. It's a fantastic movie. Something we needed for a long time. WATCH IT! PAY ATTENTION!",1311638400,3,1452,4.555555555555555
4319600,5,B004BLJQOK,"I seriously suggest that you watch Let the Right One In first.

All of the subtle overtones, motivation and beautiful cinematography is captured by the original.  For nearly identical scripts and dialogue, both movies get things right... and wrong.

I like the pacing of Let Me In much better, however the US version is so much more superficial and melodramatic than the original.  Let Me In is a great movie, but it's very Americanized.  Eli in Let the Right One In is manipulative, in Let Me In she is portrayed more innocently.  The father becomes detached and pretty much commits suicide due to jealousy of Eli and the young boy, an undertone pretty much missing from the remake.  Also, the story dealing with the woman who turns into a vampire is much more meaningful in the original... In Let Me In, she is quickly killed off.  Let the Right One In explores her becoming, and her eventual suggested suicide.  The scene where she is attacked by cats in the original never made it to Let Me In, and that scene was fantastic, but it really didn't do much for the original plot line.  It did help portray what happens when one becomes a vampire, so in this aspect, removing this story from Let Me In detracts it from being the pure vampire movie everyone says it is.  The original is much better at this than Let Me In.

I honestly like both movies about the same for very different reasons.  They're both keepers and it's amazing that a remake so recently done after the original could be so successful.",1311465600,3,1506,4.553903345724907
4319601,2,B004BLJQOK,"When Let Me In was announced, there was backlash from fans of the original Swedish film Let the Right One In, given that the original film had just came out. It's par for the course for a foreign film to be remade so soon after its release nowadays, but director /writer Matt Reeves assured them that this would not be a typical remake. Instead, he promised that this would be a different take on the original novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  He had also told Lindqvist in a private conversation that he had no intention of copying the Swedish film but had fallen in love with the novel and wanted to use that. Given that the novel is significantly different from the original film, there was plenty of new material that Reeves could have chose from. For example, the character of Hakan in the novel is considerably more disturbing than anything the Swedish film showed.

While I can't say if Reeves' film changed since he made those original comments, anyone familiar with both the novel and the Swedish film will know that this film is very much a straight up remake of the film. It follows the Swedish screenplay beat for beat, right down to elements in the Swedish film that weren't even in the original novel. There are some differences (a car crash sequence being the biggest one) but for the most part this is Tomas Alfredson's original film with minor cosmetic changes. Given how great the novel is, it's a shame that Reeves took the easy way out as opposed to looking at the original source material with fresh eyes and giving us something different. Maybe a more faithful adaptation would still have been weaker, but at least Reeves could say with honesty that he put his own stamp on the story as opposed to copying what had gone on before him.

The film itself pretty much follows the criteria that most American remakes of foreign horror films follow nowadays (and yes, I know that it's from a British studio). I'll give Reeves credit for not making the kids high schoolers and for trying to make a  horror film for adults, but at the same time, any serious director must know that making this Twilight would be tantamount to shooting yourself in the head. So let's check go through the checklist:

1. More violence and gore? Check. Most of the violence in the original film was restrained, here everything is cranked up to eleven. At times it's almost ridiculous. I could list numerous examples but I'd end up recapping the whole film, so one will stand for all: the finale. The original's finale is almost beautiful despite its horrific content; here, everything is loud, messy and chaotic and wouldn't seem out of place in any other horror film.

2. Simplified plot? Check. Reeves does away with most of the supporting cast and subplots in the Swedish film. For some viewers, this has been a positive, but I felt it took away from the depth of the story. In the original film, much of the victims came across as real people and made the film more tragic. Here, they're walking blood bags and little else.

3. Less ambiguity? Check. There's a lot of mystery in the Swedish film. You were left to draw your own conclusions. Here, Reeves spells everything out for the audience. The funny thing is, the original film really isn't that hard to follow or understand, so all the 'explaining' comes off as a lack of respect for the audience's intelligence. It's not as if the Swedish film was Synecdoche, New York.

4. Cleaning up 'objectionable' content? Check. This is hard to explain without spoiling it, but if you've seen the Swedish film you know what I'm talking about. There's a disturbing scene that puts the entire film into a different perspective, and deals with a theme that many are uncomfortable with. Predictably (seriously, did anyone think that was going to be in this?), it's been removed.

All in all, I really can't recommend this. At best, the film is competently made and has some decent performances. But if you've seen the Swedish film, this really doesn't offer anything different or worthwhile. It's more or less the same film, just simplified, 'cleaned up' and made gorier for mainstream audiences. If you haven't seen the Swedish film, then drop what you are doing and watch that now. If you don't want to watch the Swedish film because it's subtitled, then I'm sorry that you're missing out one of many great films from around the world.",1311465600,3,4375,4.686197916666667

The Swedish version was very light and cheerfully bright.

I also thought the kid actors were more powerful in this remake.

It is a very similar remake, but I found the Swedish original a bit too artsy , while this remake used a darker and more somber tone.

4319603,5,B004BLJQOK,"There has been a major boon in vampire stories of late but most are unwatchable because they ignore major parts of the vampire lore.  Though Let Me In actually does have vampires that do adhere to the basic vampire tenets like, as the title suggests, they have be invited in, Let Me In is not really a vampire movie, they are really just an allegory for the bulling that can go on during school.  Vampires in the movie are neither glorified nor vilified; just like the humans in the film, are just trying to get by.

Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) is the focus of the bullying and has to sit and take it until someone new moves in.  Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer) teaches him to stand up for himself, while Smit-McPhee re-teaches her how to be a kid, something she has probably has been for decades if not longer.  It is clear that Moretz and her father figure, Richard Jenkins (The Visitor)  do not kill for sport, or for the fun of it, they do it to survive and there is a guilt behind their eyes when they do that just adds another level to the story.

It is that guilt which is why there is not as much killing in the film, but when there is, it is violent enough to satisfy any horror buff and the bullying scenes are just as terrifying at times.  There is a particular graphic one take car crash that will make you wonder just how they did it (and if so, you will be in luck because there is a special feature on the DVD that goes into detail of how they pulled it off).  It definitely earns its R rating.  Let Me In is worth checking out for anyone who enjoys horror films or just great filmmaking in general.

Aside from the car crash featurette, other bonus features include an audio commentary with the director, a making of featurette as well As one devoted to special effects, and a couple deleted scenes which includes how Moretz's character was turned into a vampire.",1311379200,3,1887,4.317280453257791

Matt Reeves re-make keeps closely to the Swedish film apart from some obvious changes like moving the action to New Mexico. The story - a sort of pre-teen horror romance - is really touching and will appeal to anyone who felt like a misfit at school and/or wanted that special friend when they were growing up. The acting is superb, especially from the two young leads with Chloe Moretz (who you might recognise as the little sister from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/500-Days-of-Summer/dp/B001UV4XUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(500) Days of Summer</a>) particularly strong. She really captures something ancient, youthful, magical yet terrifying.

Having said all that I didn't find it as good as the original. There's more horror and less subtlety.

I guess it shows the difference between American and European film-making. And thank heavens they kept out the scene where Abby becomes a vampire!

Aside from the CGI effects, which were fine, director Matt Reeves seemed to find two ace young actors that had a chemistry that was unsettling. Pre-pubescent love? Kodi-Smit McPhee is a fine young actor, with insight and passion for his character, delivering a most natural angst and desire for a friend. He is bullied, mercilessly, as many are, at school. His family has fallen apart, and you never see his father or his mother's face. He is isolated. In comes Abby, played by the very brilliant Chlo Grace Moretz. Suspicion ensues, trust sorta happens, and they end up friends. There's a lot more than that, but I can't blab too much. You may already know this, but it's well put together by Mr. Reeves, and I admire this re-imagining of a fine film. McPhee and Moretz are magic together.

I saw both movies and I will said that I like the original version the most. In both movies the actors are great, I really admired their roles. But for me the end in the last one Let Me in, took out all the meaning of them being together. Yes it was dramatic when you see the kid been pull out from the lockers like a dog, and him running for the knife trying to find something to defend himself, yes it make me feel sorry for him, that's it, it was just one more story of a bully and his victim to me. Gave the idea that he was expecting that to happen, it didn't took him by surprise at all. In the original, the kid is swimming and having so much fun, his smile is so innocent and real, like a little boy will be that I just feel outrageous when this others kids harass him and the betray is even more painful to watch. Even his child response that he won't be able to hold breathing for that long, the sign of fear slowly painting in his face understanding that this time the bullies are going far, I find it more hurtful than the blank face of fear that the other kid have. And for me they miss the connection, how does a child decided to leave everything to be with this little pretty creepy monster at all without the rescue. The emotional connection is lost, he get's out from the water himself! As in the original it seems to be at first that some diabolical entity that nobody sees at first is dismembering everybody around the pool, and he is oblivious to what is happening outside, weakening as he tries to hold his breath, but when she extend her hands and pull him out of the water, the way he smiles back to her, as it was an angel that has save him, it make sense to me then that he will go after her for the rest of his life. In the last one, the kids is  not surprise to see her, and keeps his face of fear and there is no thankful look at all from him.

4319610,4,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In deals with both one boy's need to find acceptance, friendship and love, but also the darkness surrounding vampirism. Owen is a young boy who feels a sense of alienation at home with his parents having marital problems. He is also is the target of bullies at schools. He internalizes ideas of revenge with his tormentors at times when alone. Drawn to his next door neighbor, Abby, he strikes up a friendship with her and they begin to pal around. It becomes clear to Owen that Abby is not like other children. She doesn't seem to have knowledge of simple everyday things, and is seemingly never around at school, which gives Owens clues that there is something shady about her. He also overhears what appears to be verbal abuse in her home next door. A string of bizarre murders leads one policeman to believe some cult is responsible. As Owen longs more and more for friendship, he gets closer and closer to Abby, even while he suspects she is in some way connected with the murders.

A remake of the recent Swedish film Let the Right One In and based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, Let Me In is a well-thought out, intelligent horror film that has the right balance of mood, plot and gore. Although it has elements of violence and gore, it doesn't overdo it to the point of making this the focus. There's a real understated quality to the film, especially the dialogue between Owen and Abby, but it works here because both characters are trying to channel acceptance from each other and understand their conflicted inner worlds. Both leads (Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are solid in their roles as the two friends.

4319613,2,B004BLJQOK,"I watched Let Me In last night and I have to say that I am very disappointed with the new Hollywood version.  Let The Right One In (Swedish film) was so much better for many reasons.  First) no matter how you could possibly feel about subtitled foreign films Let Me In did not make up for the minuses of LTROI.  Second) I read the book - Wow, that was a crazy book.  I watched LTROI - Wow, Swedish Hollywood did a good job for the film adaptation but they left out some stuff.  I watched LMI - Wow, Hollywood watered down the story, left out some important parts and totally left the creepy horror elements out.  Hollywood, you suck. Third) Character name LTROI/LMI - Oskar/Owen, Eli/Abby, and Hakan/Thomas whole relationship thing is a dark element of the story.  Hakan/Thomas takes care of Eli/Abby and that relationship is creepy in many ways.  LTROI book tells all, LTROI movie hints at it and shows some of the creepiness of the relationship but LMI barely hints at it.  LMI just shows it as the photo of a young Thomas and the age unchanged Abby.  Whereas in the Hakan and Eli relationship Eli will reward Hakan in ways that contribute to or have caused his pedophilia ways, the Thomas and Abby relationship only shows Thomas killing and gathering blood for Abby but no hints of pedophilia on Thomas part.  Fourth) Am I the only one that thinks this story (be it the book or the movies) does not have a happy ending?  Am I the only one that thinks that Oskar/Owen is going to grow up and become the next Hakan/Thomas?  To me, LMI paints a better picture that Eli/Abby's modus operandi is to seduce a young person and mold them into a caregiver for her to use for many years if only for the scene of Owen looking at the old photo of Abby and young Thomas.  I am suspicious that be it book or movie Oskar/Owen taking care of Eli/Abby is not going to be a healthy loving relationship and Oskar/Owen will grow up and be twisted in some manner. Fifth) LTROI book and movie both express that there are real monsters in the world be they school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but the least of concerns is the little girl vampire next door.  Heck even the cats are blas about the school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but once a vampire is in the house, it is Smack Down Time. LMI did not even touch on that story line. Summation, LTROI book was awesome, LTROI movie did a really good, but LMI sucked real bad. Just my 2 cents.",1308960000,5,2533,4.4880174291939
4319614,4,B004BLJQOK,"Let me in is a true to the original retelling of the Swedish film `Lat den ratte komma in' which was based on a book. The original film was based in Blackeberg, Stockholm but the in the American version the action has shifted to a small town in New Mexico. Director Matt Reeves has chosen the year 1980 as the year in which things unfold, this has to do with the Reagan American thought process of the time of good and evil, communism. There is Owen (Kodi Smith- Mcphee) who is fighting his own fight with the school bullies, he is terrorized every day. He is lonely and friendless, it is during this time that a young girl Abby, a 250 year old vampire, according to the original book (Chloe Grace Moretz) moves next door to him and they begin an unlikely friendship which will change their lives forever.
I would not go in to details about the films pace and events as I think it would give away the story but this is in short, a very remarkable film about loneliness, finding friendship and companionship in the most unlikely places. The pace is slow and the director has not relied on sounds and CGI to bring the story to life. The horror is very subtle and the acting is amazing, two gifted young children have given such a good performance that it would give many grown up actors a run for their money. The cinematography is splendid and so are the other supporting actors. Nothing has changed from the original film; the soul is still intact only the setting has changed with a few minor changes.

4319615,4,B004BLJQOK,"American moviemakers don't have an especially impressive track record when it comes to adapting hit foreign films for stateside audiences (who generally avoid like the plague anything with subtitles).  But with ""Let Me In,"" a remake of the highly acclaimed Swedish film ""Let the Right One In,"" Hollywood finally gets one right.  This somber and chilling tale of a friendless, put-upon 12-year-old boy who becomes romantically (albeit platonically) involved with the vampire-girl next door emerges as a sort of antidote to the far more crowd-pleasing and commercially successful ""Twilight"" series, providing a more subdued and thoughtful variation on the same theme.

Transferring its setting from Scandinavia to an equally frigid and snowbound Los Alamos, New Mexico, the remake remains true to the core elements that made the original such a quality film in the first place:  its artful tone, its unsensationalistic approach to its material, and its incisive look at what it means to be a misfit in a world in which conformity is prized above all else - and never more so than during adolescence.  For Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) are both outcasts from society, Abby quite literally since her condition makes it impossible for her to interact with others in any kind of meaningful way (except to devour their blood).  But Owen is no less of an outsider, since his diminutiveness, shyness and dreamy nature make him an easy and perpetual target for the town's bullies.  It's no surprise, then, that Owen and Abby eventually reach out to one another for love and acceptance, despite the seeming impossibility of their relationship.

As a horror film, ""Let Me In"" doesn't hold back from showing us the requisite gore and grue that comes with the genre, but director Matt Reeve's script is far more concerned with the interaction among characters and the exploration of theme than it is with piling up easily achievable gross-out moments.  For instance, the gruesome task of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival helps to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.

Smit-McPhee and Moretz are both superb as the inter-species Romeo and Juliet, and there's a fine supporting cast to boot.

After giving it some time to bounce around in my head - and not hit much else up there - I have come to the conclusion that I did like this movie. The casting could not have been more spot on. Both of the young actors are amazing.

I think to some main stream American movie watchers this film may be to slow and lead to some jumped conclusions about quality and overall appeal. Maybe this is where I was confused. It is a somewhat slow paced movie, but that's okay because it works. It doesn't need to be a fast paced, everything blows up, type of movie. It's a very contained movie and has so much emotional impact.

After thinking about it I do fully appreciate this movie. I give it a four star just do to some questionable CGI-type decisions that took away from me fully enjoying this movie.

4319617,5,B004BLJQOK,"Let me In is an American film based of the Swedish novel, Let the Right One In, which was already produced as a motion picture. The story features two very lonely children who form a special bond over the span of about two weeks; it actually seems like love at first sight, or as close to it has the children are capable. The whole plot revolves around the protagonist Abby - a vampire - and her willingness to allow another to see her as she is. It takes time, but eventually Owen, her meek neighbor, finds himself friends with a blood-sucker.

The movie is slow. I think it serves to add a bit more tension and creepiness. Of course, this may set off some viewers. There is very little CGI and the special effects are used to show the story, not to shine a light on the gore The acting is beautiful and haunting, and you can quickly see how the film may end. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the best use of dull color light and empty space to push the loneliness that much further. Predictability aside, I come away from watching the film seeing how two very different people can find trust and love, despite their difference.

Do take note of the R rating. The movie puts the spotlight on the 12 year old actors, but this is not a kid's film. For every bit of violence that occurs off-camera there is a bloody scene to follow it up. The film also deals with Owen being abused horribly by fellow students.

There are scripting changes that appears to have been done to tailor the script to American audiences. Some are understandable, others are not. For example, the original is set in a Swedish community that was built in the age of Swedish socialism and this setting is part of the film's backstory which is set in the cold winter of 1982. The American version changes this to an apartment complex during a cold snowy winter in ....  1980's Arizona(?). The impact of the setting laid out in the original is lost in the remake. In the original, Oscar's mother is obviously not religious; in the remake Owen's mother (name change here) is clearly very religious for no apparent reason.
  The original film has a particularly Swedish approach to storytelling which is one of things that makes it such an interesting film for film fans who like to understand a director's style.
  Much has been made about the use of CGI in this film. The remake has too obviously inserted CGI in 2 critical scenes. They are fake looking, obviously CGI,  and are out of place in a film that was produced to have a realistic film approach.
The remake IS a good film and a welcomed relief for what passes as a horror film nowadays, and normally would deserve a higher rating then 3 stars. But since I rate the original a 4-star film, and the remake is not quite the film that the original is, this version need a lesser rating.  The director also makes, in my opinion, a mistake in his commentary in not acknowledging that his film is a direct remake of the original. He takes credit for the look of film which is clearly not his; lighting, cinematography, and acting style is a copy of the work of Tomas Alfredson. Watch both and see for yourself.",1308441600,,1931,4.579710144927536
4319619,4,B004BLJQOK,"I had heard that this was a rare case of the American version being better than the European one.  It was definitely a bit gorier, and much more clear.  There were parts of the Euro version that I just did not understand and it wasn't because of the language barrier, but the subtlety of the filmmaking.  It followed the plotline very closely.  I thought the European actress was a bit more effective at looking spooky and starving and pathetic all at the same time.  Chloe Grace Moretz is a wonderful actress and has that wise/old look in her eyes, but her face is still a little bit cherubic to pull this off.  I love Richard Jenkins and felt like his character was fleshed out (pardon the pun) a bit more in the American version.

Definitely a well-made film, very moody and dark.",1308182400,4,783,4.471830985915493

Many reviewers claim its inferiority to the original (too violent, etc.) but I found it to be a brillant roller coaster of a ride... You move along the plot line slowly then BAM, you're jumping!!!

4319621,4,B004BLJQOK,"First, the elephant in the room ... the original film, Let The Right One In, is easily one of the best horror movies of the past decade. For this reason, an American remake was almost entirely unnecessary. That said, everyone involved did a pretty great job with the material. The direction is dazzling, throwing back to 80's America instead of the cold backdrop of Sweden. The brilliant casting of Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee marks a rare intelligent decision by Hollywood. The tension is thick. It doesn't quite reach the highs that the original does, but if you've never seen it, or are really not into foreign films with subtitles, consider this one of the best horror films of 2010. The Blu Ray transfer is impressive, both the video and audio are flawless. Even if you've seen the original a million times, check this one out, you'll enjoy it.",1308096000,2,855,4.74496644295302

Because of pathetic little boy and his miserable life. Anyway I skipped a little in the movie. Until the girl came into the picture. Then it just caught me. I was watching it with questions on my mind, I was hooked by how good the movie actually was. It was thrilling and entertaining and bit of drama as well. I was  upset when it actually ended.

4319625,4,B004BLJQOK,"With the various depictions of vampires in contemporary American culture, LET ME IN, a remake of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, relies less on flash and style than on emotional investment and neediness. Not having seen the original Swedish film, my review comes only from my impressions of this version. On the whole, I found the story troubling in a number of ways. Placing the film almost entirely from the boy's perspective suggests the various vulnerabilities he faces, victimized by school bullies, abandoned by his separated parents (the father having moved out, the mother resorting to alcohol and sleeping pills), and finding consolation only in candy and voyeurism, the boy seems a product of any number of cliches. Frankly, the film telegraphs its patterns early on, and there can be little question after the first half hour how it will end. The film works for me, though, in how we reach this ending. There are some stylistic turns, such as camera placement in vehicles, that can be absolutely disorienting. There are subtle indictments of institutions--the most blatant being the overcrowded school system, where even the most dedicated teacher cannot possibly keep an eye on all students--that suggest that children face any number of difficulties aside from the ""monsters"" of fantasy. There is also the restrained employment of conventional horror elements--shocking when they occur, not used so much to dull the senses. This film offers a talented rendering of familiar patterns and deflates the high romanticism of its contemporary vampire stories.",1306108800,4,1556,5.228

Nevertheless, Moretz shines in this film and with her roles lately (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG983M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-a-Wimpy-Kid/dp/B002ZG97F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/500-Days-of-Summer/dp/B001UV4XUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(500) Days of Summer</a>), she's proving to be quite the young actress! This film proves that she can do drama with the best of 'em! Reeves does great with the directing but the screenwriting adaptation is something to be desired.

4319629,5,B004BLJQOK,"I've seen the U.S. and Swedish versions of this film a total of 5 times in a very short time.  I've NEVER given any film that much attention.  I usually consider watching films multiple times to be a waste of precious hours of my life.  Saw it, cataloged it, move on.  But John Lindqvist's novel affected me like nothing I've read in a very long time.  And in my opinion both films are shining tributes to that book.  I've been trying to decide which film is superior and upon viewing Matt Reeve's classic for the 3rd time it hit me.  Who cares?!  I'll build a shrine to both of them.  There are film snobs who will be unable to make one positive comment about the American version.  U.S. films never measure up, right?  Let them rant.
I'm not saying I think Let Me In is perfect.  Johan Soderqvist's score to the Swedish version captures the beauty and heartbreak of this love story in a way that Giacchino's does not.  In places the U.S. film's score becomes an unnecessary distraction.  I'm not a big fan of the use of CGI in the U.S. version either.  Matt Reeves in some places makes use of plot devices and in others omits elements that alter the story and deny us some of it's full impact.  He sacrificed a bit more of what could have been our complete understanding of Abby's history and who she really is (Read the book, people!). To be fair, neither film has the time to fully introduce Eli/Abby to us, but perhaps this adds to her mystique, at least where the movies are concerned.  I consider mine to be minor critcisms.  Mr. Reeves didn't set out to make a carbon-copy of Alfredson's classic.
To those who claim this is a scene-for-scene duplicate I say you know that's ridiculous.  Reeves tells the story from a slightly different point of view and gives prominence to different characters than Alfredson did.  Different character emphasis, alternate narrative, different scenes.  if he hadn't maintianed the important (and therefore similar) elements, his film's connection to the book would be weak.  Was this remake necessary?  Go ahead and argue it if you like.  Is it a worthy and worthwhile contribution to American cinema?  I say absolutely!  In the long history of the ""horror"" genre there are very, very few films that can really be considered classics and far fewer still that transcend the genre in a way that allows them to be taken seriously.  Let Me In can take it's place among those rate creations.  And given the unfortunate aversion of many Americans to dubbed or sub-titled foreign movies, Let Me In delivers the story in a more palatable format.  This film is a must-see however, if for no other reason than to catch a glimpse of two phenomenal young actors in action.  Chloe and Kodi, I'll happily declare myself your No. 1 fan (not counting parents and other immediate family members of course).  Their performances are (sorry) Kick-A**!
One last thought.  For those who found this film ""boring"", I'll give you my definition.  Boring is watching the same splatter film you've seen fifty times, only with a different title and different actors, hoping maybe you'll be treated to some as yet unthought of approach to dismemberment, not a ghost of a chance the movie will give you as much to think about as Let Me In does.  Take if from someone who has been watching horror films for a very long time and felt I should have given up years ago.  That is until Alfredson and Reeves rescued horror from Halloween (Zombie) oblivion.  Thank you gentlemen.",1304812800,4,3482,4.650819672131147
4319630,5,B004BLJQOK,"When I saw the previews for Let Me In, I figured it was a cheesy vampire story where instead of love-crushed teens, we'd have a slightly younger generation, probably going on Freddy-like killing sprees.  Needless to say, I wasn't interested.  But when it was the only new movie on the shelf I hadn't seen, I figured it was worth a shot.

It might be one of my favorite movies of all time.

Let Me In is a horror movie for people who don't really like horror movies.  Sure, there's vampires, serial killers, downright evil bullies, and a hefty body count, but the movie isn't really about that.  It's about a relationship forged between a skinny little boy who's constantly tormented, and a young girl who is cast out from the world and unable to interact with it due to her vampirism.  The majority of the violence is not typically shown on screen, but the bloody clothes and walls probably make this too intense for some, but those people are truly missing out.

The acting is phenomenal, and the director does a marvelous job of integrating all the many fantastic elements of the story to create an atmosphere that is dark and brooding, but still the perfect place for two children to form a bond of friendship.  You couldn't ask for a better vampire movie, or for a better movie in general.",1304640000,3,1293,4.562770562770563

4319632,5,B004BLJQOK,"Okay; I didn't realize this was a remake when I saw it and I haven't seen the original yet.

That said: Let Me In is an excellent, thought-provoking film about good, evil, and the technicalities that bind the two in the world of an adolecent.  The vampire twist is simply a side-note in a story about when is it right to do the wrong thing.

The biggest plus in this film for me was McPhee and Moretz.  These kids both demonstrate acting talent well beyond their years and I look forward to seeing them in more roles. Their chemistry in this film was perfect and both their characters and their relationship is very believable.

Kudos to Reeves for not doing what could have been done to ruin this film: over-doing the gore.  The blood and body-parts in this are kept to a smart minimum.  The fire-scene in the hospital room had to have cost a pretty penny and was a well chosen use of the films SFX budget.

4319634,4,B004BLJQOK,"I'll admit that I went into this film expecting just another stupid vampire film.  Like zombies in video games, every big film these days just has to have vampires and it's all thanks to Twilight and Friends.  It has become the comedy staple of many satires (including the horribly made Vampires Suck) and online parodies that makes any member of the general audience just roll their eyes when they hear about a film coming out about vampires.  Because of this established norm, my friends and I scheduled a movie night hoping to heckle or ""riff"" the hell out of Let Me In just like we had done with Sharktopus the week prior.

When the credits rolled and we all looked at each other, we made the startling observation that we had not really done any riffing at all.  We got a few jabs in early on during the opening scene in the hospital (they were Dirty Harry references BTW), but they quickly began to trail off as the film went on.  We began to get drawn into the film and soon the entire audience, myself included, just watched the film intently.  We enjoyed it, thoroughly and couldn't believe what had just transpired.

The film has a very basic premise, forbidden love between a bullied preteen kid and a girl vampire (this ISN'T a spoiler as it's written in the description and on the back of the box).  It kinda reminds me of any Disney film pertaining to forbidden love but much, much, MUCH more graphic.  Definitely not for kids (the falling body parts in the pool at the end of the film put this one over the top for an ""R"" rating).  The love part isn't overdone like it is in Twilight and the characters are real people, not hairless musclebound teenagers that use any excuse to take their shirts off.  It's a cute little love story.

Now, normally I am very black and white on villains, killers, moral vagrants, etc. in that I believe one must atone for their mistakes in one way or another.  However, despite the vampire character randomly attacking and killing innocent people, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her since it's in her nature.  She is no more guilty than an alligator taking a victim that got too close to the water in a swamp.  It also adds to the character development of both the boy (I never could remember names) and the vampire as they struggle with this horrific truth and try to go on with their lives.  It kept us reeled in.

Now, I did not see the original so I cannot comment on whether it is better, worse, or about the same.  While I never pass up a good foreign film such as Das Boot, My Sassy Girl (the Korean version), or any good anime, this one slipped under my radar.  Sorry.

All in all, I was very impressed with this one.  I might actually show my girlfriend this one and that's a big deal since I've only shown her my favorites.  Well worthy of viewing for anyone... except children.",1303344000,9,2839,4.427745664739884

There was so little purpose in this film - as was apparently evidenced by its low box office take - as to warrant it completely unnecessary. Sure, it's beautifully shot (except for some laughable 'vampire attacking' effects). Sure, it's got moody production design and satisfying gore. But guess what? So had the original, 'Let The Right One In.' Guess what else the original had? Storytelling. Horror. Tension. Pacing. Mystery. And questions unanswered, the best part of any filmic story whose roots are hidden in the shadows of culture.

I didn't bother with the features on the DVD because I frankly didn't care. Why couldn't this have been an original vampire story, told with the same amount of care and skill by such extraordinarily talented actors as Richard Jenkins, Chloe Moretz and the spellbinding Kodi Smit-McPhee (I can't believe he's Australian!)?

4319639,2,B004BLJQOK,"I rented this after reading a review of it that said it was as good, and in some ways better, than the original film. It's not in the same league at all, for the following reasons. The soundtrack is heavy handed and corny. The heavily saturated look of the film is unoriginal and has been done much better elsewhere (the first Red Riding film, anything by David Fincher). The creepy androgyny of the vampire in the Swedish version has been lost--she really seems like a different species of creature in the original. The bullies are also much more menacing in the first movie. At the end of that film, you really believe that they're these weird hick psychos willing to kill the little boy; here they seem more annoying than frightening. They give the main character a wedgie at the beginning of the US film; the boy screams and whines, and actually wets himself. I thought he overreacted: it was only a wedgie, after all. In the original, one gets the sense that they boy's life is unbelievably bleak, and made even more miserable by the sadistic attentions of these three bullies. It makes sense, therefore, that he would bond with the vampire girl from next door. The ugly 80s socialist environment of the original heightens one's sense of the boy's predicament. Here, the 80s environment seems like a mere schtick (fun 80s soundtrack, anyone? Yawn.). Finally, I'd heard that this movie made some key changes to the original film. Not so--many of the key scenes are almost identical. The original is ultimately a beautiful, bleak, deeply weird love story; this one's a slightly boring rehash.",1302393600,7,1595,4.782608695652174

4319642,5,B004BLJQOK,"Many movies are slow in getting developed. ""Let Me In"" is no exception. However, that is what is so good about it! Never have I been glued to a screen when not much is happening as I was here.

The direction and cinematrography were exceptional. The snowy backdrop to the fiery story was a constrast for the induction of perfection. And in that snowy world we find a pre-teen love story between a boy and a girl vampire made all the more passionate by the seclusion and implied desolation of those surroundings. It was clear that Writer/Directior Matt Reeves' (Cloverfield) heart was in it from the word 'Go'.

Casting and acting couldn't have been better either. The two pre-teen leads, Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) of ""The Road"" and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) of ""Kick-Ass"" were outstanding. Love between children of 12 years of age usually seems out of place and awkward, not so here. You could feel the passion they had for one another, and you could fully understand the disappointment Abby felt in her inability to be a girl with a boyfriend leading the normal life of a child.

The entirety of ""Let Me In"" was shrouded in sadness, but that was okay. It was tolerable and needed. There were references to Romeo & Juliet, and that, I'm sure was to imbue the understanding of the sadness in that story in parallel to this one. And there WERE parallels, yes, but nothing that would make it a vampiric remake of R & J in the least.

Overall, I was thoroughly surprised and enlightened by ""Let Me In."" Most definitely re-watchable! Five Stars *****",1302134400,4,1543,4.641025641025641
4319643,5,B004BLJQOK,"I have to say that Let Me In worked on several different levels for me. It is mainly touted as a horror film about vampires but despite all of the necessary blood and gore it comes through as a very touching love story. It also well-captures the pains of growing up, facing bullying at school, loneliness, isolation and first love. The two young leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen and Chlo Grace Moretz as Abby are equally magnificent. It was interesting to note that Owen's mother was never actually shown except in very brief glimpses, ala the way the Peanuts cartoons used to depict adults. With the exceptions of a few other adults the children seemed to mostly carry the film. Let Me In is such a unique addition to the horror and vampire genres. It holds its own exceptionally well against the original Swedish version, Let the Right One In. The Americanization of the story only adds another dimension. The New Mexico filming locations also added much to the feel and the atmosphere of the story, making it feel cold, isolated and uninviting. Stephen King called it ""the best American horror film for the last 20 years"". It may not be the best but it certainly is one of them. I found myself pulling for Owen and Abby to be together and I loved the ending, although I would have liked for the story to go on longer. Some have said that maybe the whole story was just a dream or a daydream of Owen's to help him cope with his unhappy life. Interesting theory, but I would like to think that wasn't the case. Anyway, the film ends without any such idea being revealed and thankfully does not take the time and effort to explain anything further.

4319644,5,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In is the American independent film remake of the highly regarded Swedish film of 2008,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-The-Right-One-In/dp/B001MYIXAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let The Right One In</a>.  After having watched both films, they tackle the same basic plot and subject matter from slightly different angles, but are both worthy of admiration.

In my mind the overall feeling of Let the Right One In is one of isolation of the main characters, Oskar and Eli.  The stark winter landscapes, washed out colors, and lack of emotion shown my almost all of the protagonists add to this feeling of isolation, dreariness, and despair.  While Let Me In certainly spends a portion of it's time on the isolation of Owen, who has no connection to anyone else until Abby moves into his life, it also shows the terror that Owen lives in.  I think that Let Me In does a better job of detailing the fear and desperation that Owen feels -  fear and desperation that allows him to justify his increasing violent actions (or acceptance of such actions) in the film.  Until the penultimate scene of Let the Right One In, I never really felt that Oskar was that oppressed by the school bullies, and I didn't understand where all of the hatred and thirst for revenge against them was coming from.

The other thing I noticed when comparing the two films was that Let Me In did a finer jobs of detailing the budding relationship between Owen and Abby better than Let the Right One In did with Oskar and Eli.  I was never fully convinced at the end of Let the Right One In why Oskar and Eli ended up together, while I understood perfectly why Owen chose to stay with Abby even though he understood the implications for his future.  Perhaps this was due to the outstanding performances by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chlo Grace Moretz in the lead roles; perhaps this was just due to a bit being lost in translation from the Swedish language film.  I just felt the connection between Owen and Abby a bit more than that between Oskar and Eli.

Now this is not meant to denigrate Let the Right One In; I think that the original can be a bit lethargic at times but is nevertheless a fine movie and deserving of its accolades.  But I would reiterate that Let Me In is an outstanding film in its own right.",1302048000,5,2333,4.759305210918114

Those who have read the novel first will be disappointed that a lot of the back story so important to the novel is not covered in the film. That's to be expected to some extent for a film trying to remain under 2 hours in duration, but viewers who have not read the book will be left with a lot of questions and few answers. They'll feel like large parts of the story are missing and they'll question the motivations of characters because the movie doesn't offer them.

It's a moody piece: Young Owen is a lonely, bullied boy who meets Abby, his new next-door neighbor who has moved in one evening with her adult companion - who is not her father, it turns out, and does her bidding by helping find her victims. The two young actors who play them are excellent: Kodi-Smit McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz already have some serious film cred, having appeared in ""The Road"" and ""Kick-Ass"", respectively.  Richard Jenkins, who was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Visitor"", seems to be making a career of playing world-weary characters, and he is excellent too, as always.

Why the hell did they remake it!? What a waste! I wonder if the Americans will do the same thing with Dragon Tattoo. How Pointless!!! What a waste of money and time and UGGH!!!!

They took out the scene where the woman gets attacked by cats...which was kinda cool. Also, the acid melted face was more realistic in the original movie. Oh and the CGI of her hunting in the American version kinda reminded me of the pitiful scenes in the new Star Wars movies where Yoda was doing his ninja tricks. And to top it all off...the movie still looked foreign even though it was filmed in America. Most of the actors looked pretty similar. Abby still looked like a boy. Her care taker looked the same.

4319659,5,B004BLJQOK,"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

Let Me In is the American adaptation of the 2008 Swedish vampire film, Let The Right One In (which I haven't seen for any basis of comparison, although I have heard awesome things about it). Rated at 89% on the Rotten Tomatoes tomatometer, Let Me In did not disappoint on either the horror front or the romance front. It's not your typical vampire film, nor is it your typical boy meets girl love story. Instead, it is an amazing combination of the two, producing a compelling movie experience that is dark and terrible as it is sweet.

Owen (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee from The Road) is a young boy who gets bullied at school and spends his time entertaining himself alone in the courtyard of his apartment building. One evening, two mysterious people show up in at night and move into the building - a young girl and her father. But Abby (played by Chloe Grace Moretz from KickAss) is no ordinary twelve-year-old girl, she is a centuries year old vampire. Despite her warning to Owen that they can't be friends, they are drawn together by a shared loneliness and a relationship starts to form. The core of this film really centers around these two young people - their dialogue, their shared silent glances, their emotions, and their budding feelings for each other. Their relationship is dark and sweet because you can't help becoming invested in them and what will essentially be a doomed romance, because Abby is what she is. On that note, I thought it was incredibly poignant when we learn exactly who Abby's father is, and know that that will also be Owen's fate, should he choose to stay with Abby.

Sweetness aside, this film also has enough horror and shocking moments to have had me covering my eyes. Abby is terrifying as a quick-moving, evil-eyed vampire with her snarling blood-drenched mouth, leaving you in no doubt of the creature that she is. She rips into flesh like nobody's business, snapping necks and tearing bloody chunks out with her teeth. Even Abby's father who garbs himself from head to toe in a black garbage bag is creepy and frightening when he goes hunting for Abby. The scarier parts of this movie only add dimension to the sweeter parts, like Abby and Owen's interaction, and it just makes you feel for them more because there's no ""happy ever after"" for them. He'll kill for her, protect her, feed her, and she'll leave him behind when he gets too old ... just like the boy-turned-old-man before him. It's so tragic.

I thought Abby was a complex and fascinating character. She drew me in because she's doomed to be a child forever trapped in the life of this monstrous vampire, and a lot of how she is comes across as very childlike. For me, she was as good as Kirsten Dunst in Interview With A Vampire. Like Kirsten, she played the vampire versus the child amazingly well - the violent growling at her father for not getting any blood versus the sweetness of her normal girl voice is incredible. Her ability to be both monster and innocent was phenomenal. I don't think she's manipulative and scheming as suggested by other reviewers in terms of looking for someone else to take care of her. She tried to leave Owen for his own good, and ends up coming back to save his life. So that for me, erased the whole thought that her actions were contrived to make Owen fall in love with her. I think she also fell in love with him, and she knows that he protected her, too.

Owen was also a complex character, although in a different way, almost an opposite way to Abby. He's a powerless bullied kid who wants to awaken the monster inside of him - he wants to punish his tormenters. This is evident when he's stabbing the tree with a penknife, hissing ""you scared, little girl?"" It's interesting because he's afraid of a few kids, but yet he's able to face and even love the utter terror of a creature like a vampire.

I especially loved the juxtaposition of Let Me In with Romeo and Juliet, which Owen was reading in school, in terms of highlighting the beauty and tragedy of their relationship. Let Me In is a beautiful and terrifying film. I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours after I'd seen it, especially about Owen's eventual choice and the cost of such a choice. It was both bittersweet and chilling.

Superbly acted and one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen, I would rate Let Me In 5 out of 5 stars.",1300579200,6,4383,4.575796178343949
4319660,3,B004BLJQOK,"I remember I was very excited to see that there was an American version of ""Let The Right One In"" being made and thought that the casting of Chloe Grace Moretz in the role of the young vampire was perfect. But having seen the original and liked it very much, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed with the remake. Specifically, I was unable to connect with the character of Owen, the young boy, as I did with Oskar in the original. I think this is because a better job was done in the original on establishing Oskar's lonliness and insecurity. So in turn we're more able to relate to his connection with the child-vampire. Also, I think the New Mexico setting did not lend to the feeling of desolation that adds so much to the ""feel"" of the original (set in rural Sweden).

Admittedly, I'm comparing this with the original and that may not be fair. So I'll say, as a stand alone vampire flick, ""Let Me In"" is a slick production that is well-paced and entertaining. Chloe Grace Moretz indeed does an excellent job as the young vampire but there's no real connection with the other characters or their situations for me and as a result I think this is a decent remake but does not come up to the level of film-making of the original.",1300579200,10,1238,4.406113537117904
4319661,5,B004BLJQOK,"Alright kiddies, time to grow up. Take your Twilight DVDs and throw them into the garbage where they belong. Time to graduate from grade school and move right in with the upper class. Let Me In is the vampire movie that real vampire movie fans have been wanting for years. (Before I continue I just want to apologize to the fans of Twilight. I mean no offense. I'm only saying, in a humorous way, that Let Me In is in no way Twilight.)

Some of you may already know this but Let Me In is a remake of a Swedish film ""Let the Right One In."" For those of you who may have seen this I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Let Me In. With the exception of a few scenes, Let Me In stays true to the original. The few scenes that were changed were mostly do to cultural difference or confusing segments. Let Me In is neither better nor worse, it's just an Americanized version of a very good movie.

For those who didn't know of or see the original, you're in for a treat. I wouldn't call this a horror film, but more of a dramatic thriller. It follows a young boy named Owen, a skinny, shy, socially awkward twelve year old. His young life is in shambles: his parents are divorcing, he doesn't have any friends, and he's being bullied in school. The only thing in his life that makes him happy are Now & Laters. But then Abby moves in next door, a mysterious young girl who finds Owen just as curious as he finds her. They slowly strike up a friendship, and through her Owen starts to take a little bit of control in his life. Yet something doesn't seem right about Abby, and Owen must decide if he wants to let that get in the way of his friendship with the young girl Abby.

Let Me In doesn't pull many punches in terms of content. It is brutal and bloody. It has quite a few mature situations. And it carries with every scene a brooding and dark atmosphere. I guess that's to be expected though when it comes to real vampire films.

I can highly recommend this movie to any fan of quality horror or thriller films. It's a solid addition to a very small line of movies (that being good, mature vampire films). And, if you're sick of those sparkling-chested, sun-walking, baseball-playing, emo-vampires from ""other"" movies then you'll love Let Me In....

4319662,5,B004BLJQOK,"""Let Me In"".

The title sends a shudder up your spine.

Based on the novel by Swedish author John Lindquist ""Let The Right One In"", this may be the best vampire genre movie I've watched since Stephen King's vampire masterpiece ""Salem's Lot"".

An independent film with a powerful cast including ""Kick Ass"" star Chloe Grace Moretz, it's based in 1983 and tells the story of 12 year old Owen who's brutally bullied at school, has divorced parents, an alcoholic mother he lives with, and is desperately seeking an identity. He is soon befriended by new 12 year old neighbor 'Abby' (Moretz), a girl with a dark secret.

""Let Me In"" is a love story, a redemption story, a tragedy, and vampire movie all rolled into one. Of course, it is the polar opposite of the usual Hollywood flash and glamour portrayal of vampires and delves into what a dark curse vampirism really can be, so all you ""Twilight"" and ""Vampire Diaries"" fans beware. This movie shows you why you DON'T want to become one of the ""undead"".

These independent films don't have the flashy multi-million dollar special effects budgets that the big Hollywood mega-films do, and neither does this one, and that's a blessing, because it's what makes this film deliver so well. It's the ACTING and the story being told that carries this film. The cast is a superb chorus of talent, intelligence, and experience. Moretz (Abby), Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen), and Richard Jenkins absolutely shine in this film.

This may be one of the best films I've watched in over 10 years, and if you enjoy the vampire/horror genre, watch it. Even Stephen King said ""'Let Me In' is the best horror film in the last twenty years"".

My only beef is one of the deleted scenes included in the Special features called ""Be Me"". If you've ever watched ""Let the Right One In"", this was a scene in the movie that actually came from the book when Eli showed Oskar the brutal way she/he became a vampire. For some reason, this extremely important scene was deleted from ""Let Me In"", because it showed how Abby, like her counterpart Eli in ""Let The Right One In"", used a form of telepathy to rely to Owen how she was turned.

Watch this scene after the movie, or include it in where you'll realize it should be during the movie.

Also suggested is the original Swedish film ""Let The Right One In"", which is every bit as good as ""Let Me In"", maybe even better because it delves more into the original book's story. I've bought this one from Amazon too and enjoyed it thoroughly as well.

The book is also an incredible read, and it very hard to put down.

4319663,5,B004BLJQOK,"""Let Me In"" is the Hollywood remake of ""Let the Right One In"", a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but both the original film and remake managed to handle these multiple themes in a credible manner.

The remake is not exactly faithful to the original, and viewers who have watched both will notice the differences such as the opening scene, the changes in characterization for some of the minor characters, etc. For the most part though, the remake focuses on the essential parts of the story just as in the original and makes for riveting viewing. This is not the movie to watch if you're looking for pretty vampires smooching around, or a splatterfest with non-stop action. There's hints of a romance, slowly simmering, a mixture of Gothic and sweet teenage love, and there's also lots of blood, but by no means does this movie careen along - it takes its time developing the characters, drawing viewers into this strange, dark world where nothing is at it appears, and focuses viewers' attention on the two main characters.

The story is of teenager Owen [Kodi Smit-McPhee] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Owen doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Owen meets a strange girl named Abby [Chloe Moretz] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Abby has just moved into the apartment next door to Owen's with a man Owen thinks is her dad. Despite Abby's words, the pair are drawn to each other, and form a real friendship. For a while at least, Owen remains blissfully unaware of the dark secret hidden by Abby and her `dad'.

""Let Me In"" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Owen and Abby manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role. The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire. Abby is a young-looking  yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.

""Let Me In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see. The film is rated R, with Spanish subtitles, and English subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired. The film is in color, and the running time is 115 minutes. Special features include an audio commentary with director Matt Reeves; a feature titled From the Inside: A Look At The Making of Let Me In; The Art of Special Effects; Car Crash Sequence Step-By-Step; Deleted Scenes; Trailer Gallery; and, a Poster Gallery.",1300320000,6,3485,4.792013311148087
4319664,4,B004BLJQOK,"The story is wisely spun based on the original novel ""Let the Right one In"". The acting is fine, but the horror elements are likely to turn those off who do not like to be grossed out. Slasher film enthusiasts will be disappointed to find it isn't a slasher. For the rest of us willing to let the movie stand on its own merits, we won't be disappointed. It is a vampire's movie from a vampire's point of view. Abby isn't a serial killer, really, she just needs to drink blood to live. Alright, despite the totally bizarre nature of the vampire right there (really, think about it), she must be a kind and gentle soul, well except for the fact that she is codependent on another person for her feeding frenzy, and ultimately destroys that person for whatever limited safety and relationship she can provide them from the outside world (and really - high school bullies who would actually drown a kid they don't like?

4319665,4,B004BLJQOK,"Twelve-year-old Owen is mercilessly abused by his schoolmates.  He is befriended by a strange neighbor, Abby, who doesn't wear shoes in the snow; Abby has been twelve years old for a very long time and keeps insisting she's not a girl.  Abby is a vampire who feeds on her neighbors.  Victims of child abuse, Owen and Abby form a romantic bond that will eventually have tragic consequences.

  ""Let Me In"" is a horror film that I would've enjoyed more if I hadn't already seen the original Swedish version ""Let the Right One In.""  ""Let the Right One In"" is a superb psychological horror film centered around lonely, troubled adolescents who can empathize with one another; based on the best-selling novel of the same title, it has developed a worldwide cult following.

  The acting in ""Let Me In"" is superb.  Child stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz give excellent performances.  However, the real surprise came from Richard Jenkins who gave an award-winning performance as the mild mannered music professor in ""The Visitor.""  Coincidentally, in ""The Visitor,"" Jenkins befriends and aids two illegal immigrants.  In ""Let Me In,"" he befriends and protects the vampire Abby and is even forced to kill for her.  These scenes were quite shocking.  From the commentary, we learn Jenkins performed all his own stunts.

  The plot for ""Let Me In"" is very similar to the one for ""Let the Right One In.""  Much of the dialogue, especially from Owen and Abby, was verbatim.  The major difference was the introduction of the policeman who replaces the role of the nosy, vindictive neighbor in ""Let the Right One In.""  The policeman made ""Let Me In"" more realistic; however, viewers developed a liking for the policeman's character.  The outcome of his investigation draws sympathy away from the children who are made to look more like evil villains rather than the ill-fated victims of the novel's intent.

  Despite the fact that ""Let Me In"" is a low-budget Hammer production (famous for their classic horror films of the late fifties to early seventies), the special effects are quite awesome.  The extra features on the DVD are required viewing.  They display the computer graphics used when Abby viciously attacks her victims and climbs trees, fences and hospital walls.  The elaborate car crash sequence was filmed outdoors using a cameraman mounted on the vehicle who was actually driving it; the scene was also filmed on stage in front of a blue screen and the vehicle was attached to a giant chicken rotisserie that spun it around and around.

  The commentary from Matt Reeves (visionary director of the innovative, groundbreaking ""Cloverfield"" - a gloomy, claustrophobic monster film as seen from the lens of a home video camera) is interesting and informative.  I was never bored.  It was unbelievable to learn what was actually filmed at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and what was created by computer graphics.  For example, remember when Jenkins attacks the boy at the railroad tracks?  The train never existed.  Also, from listening to Reeves, one learns more about Abby's background and why she keeps telling Owen that she is not a girl when he wants to date her.  One must watch the deleted scene titled ""Be Me.""  Actually, the entire film is about Owen empathizing with Abby's plight.  She kills in order to survive; however, Owen can't judge her because he fantasizes about killing Kenny and the other bullies.

  The viewer learns there are numerous instances of child abuse in ""Let Me In.""  Owen seems to suffer the most in the film.  He is psychologically harmed by his parents' divorce and is bullied at school by Kenny.  Kenny is bullied by his older brother; therefore, he relieves his pent-up anger and stress by abusing Owen.  Many years ago, Abby was forever physically traumatized by an elderly nun.  Now she is forced to feed on the blood of others.  ""Romeo and Juliet"" is a novel read by Owen and his classmates which is apropos to the film.  A tragedy, ""Romeo and Juliet"" mirrors the doomed romance of Owen and Abby; eventually, it will lead to tragedy.  The commentary suggests that Jenkins' character was once a twelve-year-old boy who developed a friendship with Abby.

  With the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, I read the full color miniature comic book, ""Let Me In: Crossroads,"" that was included with my copy of the DVD.  It has good illustrations.  The first of four in a new series, this comic is a prelude to the film.  Taking place in the farming community of Wellsville, Indiana, it gives Abby's guardian/protector a name, Thomas, and depicts more of Abby's vicious quest for blood.  Fans of the film may want to read this comic book series from Dark Horse Comics and Hammer.

  I would've enjoyed ""Let Me In"" more if Matt Reeves had made it more different from the Swedish film ""Let the Right One In.""  My dad said the same thing.  While watching the opening scenes of ""Let Me In,"" he asked, ""Didn't I see that boy and girl in another film?""  I told him we had watched ""Let the Right One In,"" which has the same plot.  Reeves should have taken into consideration the fans who had already seen ""Let the Right One In.""  Also, the gory finale of ""Let Me In"" would've been more enjoyable if the bullies hadn't turned the lights off in the pool house.  If it hadn't been for the commentary, I wouldn't have known exactly what had happened.  ""Let Me In"" is gorier and has superior special effects than ""Let the Right One In.""  However, the latter came first and has the element of surprise.

  I have no regrets watching ""Let Me In.""  I feel that I learned a lot more about the relationship between the vampire and the boy.  In order to learn the complete story, I feel compelled to read the novel ""Let the Right One In"" by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  According to Matt Reeves, the film would have to be a miniseries in order to give justice to the highly involved novel.  I have read Lindqvist's novel ""Handling the Undead,"" which is an expertly written psychological horror novel focusing on people's reactions upon learning their loved ones have returned from the grave.  ""Let Me In"" is required viewing if you want to delve deeper into the mystique of the Swedish horror sensation ""Let the Right One In.""

4319666,5,B004BLJQOK,"Abby is, to all appearances, a young girl of about 12 or so.  She arrives in a small New Mexico town in the early '80s and takes up residence in the apartment next to that of Owen, a lonely, bullied young boy whose isolation and anger are just beginning to twist him in ways that Abby may find useful.  See, the man who appears to be Abby's father isn't: he's more like her Renfield.  And as much as he loves Abby, he's beginning to grow old, and the cost of keeping her fed is taking a heavy toll on him.

Abby is a vampire trapped in the body of a child, and she has a problem: soon, she'll need a new caregiver.  And Owen is looking like a good prospect.

LET ME IN is a quietly effective horror film done the way horror used to be done, with great subtlety and quiet seduction.  It draws its audience to it the way that Abby draws Owen to her, a little bit at a time, letting the tension build and then revealing itself in slow stages.

This was an excellent movie.  Do not miss it.",1300233600,4,986,4.067357512953368

When I first heard they were gong to remake Let the Right One IN i figured it would be really bad but this is one of the very rare cases where I think the remake is as good, or in this case, even better, than the original. If I decide to watch the story again, which I will eventually, its more likely I'll watch Let Me In than Let the Right One IN.",1300147200,3,456,3.7604166666666665
4319668,3,B004BLJQOK,"I wasn't too sure what to expect from this movie. I've watched other 'vampire' movies but this was different. Not better, not worse, just different from the usual commercial vampire storyline.

I didn't see the original and I didn't read the original book so my expectations were open. The movie is pretty dark and gloomy most of the time (which makes sense because of the main character's 'condition'. I was enjoying it to some extent until the first attack scene where the special effects went very 70's. Unrealistic, odd, stilted movement quickly dissolved any suspension of reality while watching.

It has such a dark and depressing theme throughout, the scenery, characters, and events were all big downers while watching.

What I did like is the fact that it was not the usual box office American movie. It was unique enough to keep me watching but too depressing to watch again.",1300147200,,885,4.886666666666667
4319669,4,B004BLJQOK,"First off let me say I never saw the original Let The Right One In so this review is just based on this movie. I thought this movie was well thought out. It's not your typical vampire movie which I liked. Granted it did involve killing but it had a great storyline which just added to the movie. This movie was more creepy and eerie than it was scary so be forewarned. I loved how they took a vampire movie and incorporated a love story. You do not see this very often which makes this movie a true gem. The two main characters (Abby and Owen) showed great chemistry together and they portrayed a great love story.

If you are looking for a fresh new vampire movie with a love story then look no further than Let Me In. You also get a little comic book as an added bonus!!",1300060800,3,772,4.1466666666666665
4319670,4,B004BLJQOK,"I watched the original, then this version, then I read the book.  I found that the two movie versions were very similar and I enjoyed both versions.  The acting was not ""Oscar"" winning performances, but the young actors in both versions were great and made the characters believable.  I also found the ""controlled"" vampire refreshing.  Not seeing a vampire losing control at the mere sight of a neck to bite on gave the store a real chance.

The one thing that I noticed was that I was asking a lot of questions about the characters and their thoughts and reasoning.  This is where the book came in.  It really dealt deeper into the story under the story and answered some character questions.  It tied all the loose ends for me.

I enjoyed all three and would recommend each.",1300060800,2,776,4.565217391304348

I liked the original a lot, but I liked this one much more, and I wasn't ready to.  I thought it would be a cheap recreation of an awesome foreign movie, but that's not the case.  The acting is better, the story is tighter, and the vampire is scarier.  The little boy in the movie is a really great actor.  I bet we will see a lot more of him.  The little girl was good too.  I love scary movies, and I've seen most of them, but this is definitely one of the best I've seen in a really long time.",1300060800,4,599,3.9008264462809916

We then understand the meaning of the words ""I've been twelve for a very long time"". At this point, Owen had to make the choice of his life: to choose the companionship, safety, and understanding he receives from a very dangerous source, knowing well that it may have to be a lifelong commitment to Abby, or continue with his life of loneliness. Kids are very impressible at this young age - and Owen, whose parents are divorcing, and is bullied at school, is no exception. He is the nice kid who gets involved with the ""wrong crowd"" - because no other crowd was truly interested in him.",1300060800,,796,4.348993288590604

4319676,4,B004BLJQOK,"I originally thought ""A child vampire? Done before, wasn't great."" This was actually better than I had expected which is always nice. It's a twist on the humanity of vampires (well what's left) and how finding that one person who understands and accepts you can be terrifying and beautiful, obviously for the plot line also a little gory lol. It also has a Romeo and Juliet kind of feel, kinda of. Not so much ""horror"" or ""thriller"" as it's a more of a ""suspense"" that sucks you in just enough to wanting to know what's next.

The most unique piece for me was the take on what happens to a vampire when they are not invited in but come in anyway. Most writers just have vampires begging to come in and when the answer is a ""No"" it's like an invisible wall has stopped them so they just can't pass but this was good. Unique take and I really loved it. You'll see what I mean ;)",1299974400,,876,4.245508982035928
4319677,5,B004BLJQOK,"Nowadays, it seems that just about any film that has blood, gore, a bit of the supernatural, and cheap, predictable thrills is labeled as a horror film. I've been disenchanted by the Horror film genre for many, many years because the label is so often slapped on drivel that I find more stupid than scary, and with no real horror to it - just stupid people running around doing stupid things, and having predictable resulting events because of those actions.

""Let Me In"" is what a true, quality horror film SHOULD be. It has reminded me that a horror film doesn't have to have cheap thrills and predictable loud sounds or shocking scenes preceded by predictably suspenseful music to count as a horror film. This film just rises far, far above what typical ""Horror"" films have become over the years, which, in a word, has been disappointing. This is an excellent film, and one that I'm glad to have in my collection. It's superbly acted all around, with the villains quickly earning your loathing, and the lead characters giving nuanced performances that never go over the top, but subtly and quickly pull you in.

I'm going to try not to give any spoilers here, because I'm sure that it's easy enough to find those already most everywhere you look for reviews of this film, but suffice it to say that this will undoubtedly fulfill all that you've been hoping to find in a good horror film. ""Let Me In"" goes far beyond just a standard horror. In fact, I feel that, if the supernatural elements were taken away from it, this would simply have been seen as an excellent dark drama. But the supernatural elements just help to give it an extra boost that takes it above so much of the junk that's being released in American cinema lately.

Chloe Grace Moretz is wonderful and delicate in her portrayal of angel-faced Abby, and Kodi-Smit McPhee is heartbreakingly sweet and gentle in his portrayal of a willowy, neglected lonely boy taken to the breaking point by the bullying that has become woefully prevalent in today's schools. The young actors playing the bullies quickly had me rooting for the @$$-whupping that the head thug so richly deserved (regardless of it being outlined later that he was only doling out what he himself had obviously endured for so long).

I've already given away more than I wanted to, so I won't go into any more true detail about what exactly happens here, but I must say that I was very interested in seeing this when it hit the theatres, but never made it in time. ""Let Me In"" has, however, totally been worth the wait. It's set in the 80s, and filmed in a darker color scheme, which only contributes to the feel of being transported to a totally different time and place than what you may be used to. The clues to exactly what is happening, and how the events portrayed in the film have come about, are subtly laid out for you, which I appreciate. Having everything explained to me (as if I'm incapable of figuring it out on my own) in a film is often a let-down to me, so I appreciate that the director and screenwriter have enough trust in their audiences' intelligence to let us figure it out for ourselves.

Long story short, ""Let Me In"" is easily one of the best horrors that I've seen in DECADES. It's subtle, eerie, and dark, with great acting, just the right amount of blood and gore (with none of it misplaced), minimal and convincing CGI, and a story engaging enough that I look forward to watching it again soon.",1299801600,5,3455,4.575121163166397
4319678,4,B004BLJQOK,"It's rare when a Hollywood remake of a widely acclaimed foreign film is as good as the original.  (Just look at what happened to THE VANISHING!)  Matt Reeves, whose previous film CLOVERFIELD was a hit, adapted the Danish coming of age vampire thriller LET THE RIGHT ONE IN and made a nearly perfect Americanized film that has a heart of pure horror.  I usually hate vampire films for a lot of reasons but I love this moody, atmospheric dream that treats desire and alienation with a delicacy that makes real the sacrifices we choose to make for even fleeting intimacy.  Set in Los Alamos, Colorado -- a community with the highest IQ per capita -- the story has a bullied, frail 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) befriending his strange next-door neighbor, Abby (a terrific Chloe Moretz from KICK ASS).  Their outcast bond fortifies Owen to stand up to the bullies.  But when Owen confirms his suspicions that Chloe has a big secret, it's too late; his fate is sealed.  This beautifully acted, visually rich, stunning and tragic love story is perfect in almost every way.  Sadly, it was little seen in theaters and deserves to be rediscovered for home video.

In many ways it was a more scary experience than the orginal, and I think that was a good thing.
Kodi Smit-Mcphee was the right choice for the part. I think his face had more feeling for the story than Kre Hedebrant in the
Swedish version. - Chloe Grace Moretz was as good as Lina Leandersson.
This version gives a harder look at the mobbing problem for a child in school. You could understand the hell Owen was going through
very clearly.
John Ajvide Lindqvist is famous for this story, but this is not the only book by him worth reading.

I'm disappointed with the casing, in general.  It's the cheap recycled Blu-ray case that is flimsy because of the holes in the box to save the company money.  Also, I've seen the Blu-ray elsewhere, which had a nice plastic sleeve that when taken off you could see the girl.  This doesn't have that for some reason.  Maybe they already jumped to cheaper casing in a matter of two months since the release date.  It's strictly the cover printed out and put in the case.

The traditional vampire is a bloodsucking demon who is living out his eternal death through murder. If you like the newer, prettier version of vampirism, you may be disappointed by Abby. She is feral and freaky, compelling and repellent at the same time. Her foulness makes the question of who she ensnares that much more fascinating; who can find beauty in something so horrific?

For answers, watch Owen, the spindly little boy at the heart of this dark and hopeless love story. He is lost, afraid and isolated, and at heart he is absolutely furious. Other reviewers have pointed out that the movies are more about alienation and desperation than anything else, and they are right. Both movies have their strengths, and their areas in which they are truer to the orginal book. You don't have to choose. Watch them both.",1299628800,3,1095,4.819148936170213

Without getting long-winded, I walked away with this as my overall feeling: the director (Matt Reeves) did nothing on his own to make this film work. He re-created a lot of the same scenes and shots, and stylistically made the film look similar to the original, but in a way that felt forced, and knock-off, ham-handed and amateur. The care didn't seem to be there for each shot, the painstaking craftsmanship was gone, and what was left was a shell of a film, with it's only legs being the memory of its predecessor. I can't recommend the film to anyone, and would implore you to watch the original (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) to see what a beautiful, and unique movie experience is supposed to feel like.

Still, both movies are very diferent takes on the story, So don't think just because you saw the first one that ""Let Me In"" isn't worth watching.

In its own right, I would recommend seeing ""Let Me In"". The special effects were not quite as improved as I thought they may have been, especially in comparison with the Two Face effects in The Dark Knight Returns, but they hold up well.

I found the scenes concerned with bullying more convincing in ""Let Me In"" than they were in ""Let the Right One In"", so that's something in the remake's favour.

Overall, if you haven't seen it before and haven't seen the swedish original, I recommend ""Let Me In"". There haven't been any other vampire movies released lately, and those two certainly stand out within the genre and beyond it.",1299283200,2,983,4.611428571428571

This film explores the dark and dreary side of being a vampire and what you would do to get your precious life-sustaining blood. This is an accurate portrayal of such an existence if it were ""real"".

The two lead characters carried most of this film, and they were fantastic. The girl whom plays the vampire did a terrific job. Her character is desperate to survive. She is intelligent and street-wise. Her bloodlust is uncanny. The smell of a drop of blood turns her into a raging beast. There is no corniness or cheese-factor in her character. Remember, this is not about the fun of living forever. The relationship she develops with a weary, quiet youth has plenty of twists and turns.. and thrills.

Also, I absolutely loved the fact that this takes place in the 80's. I remember when I first attempted to de-scramble a Rubic's cube (I later discovered you could take it apart). I remember eagerly spending every last quarter in my pocket at the local arcade. Pac-Man was everywhere... from 7-11 to the bowling alley. The spinning of the Greg Kinn record on the turntable brought back memories!

My only complaint is that many scenes were very dark, as far as lighting is concerned. I understand that this was necessary as far as the story goes, but there were points where I could not see anything on the screen for minutes at a time... then all of a sudden...

Oh, and I have yet to see ""Let The Right Ones' In"", so I am not comparing the two.. and I have nothing to compare it too.. I will check the other one out for sure since everyone that bashes this one says the Swedish original is better and this is just a fake copy.

If you love horror movies this is not your typical horror film. There is a love story mixed in with the gory scenes. Also you are actually sympathetic to the killer who happens to be the young girl. This is what makes this story so unique. Not only are you hoping for the killer to get away you are also feeling sympathy for her. Abby is vulnerable even though she has super human strength. Chloe Grace Moertz rocked in ""Kick Ass"" she also did a terrific job here, as a vampire trapped in a 12 year old body. Chloe Grace Moertz has made very wise decisions in choosing her films. Just like Natalie Portman stayed away from kid movies, so far Chloe has done the same. I believe this gives her an advantage over other child actors. Some child actors are stuck with the perception they can only do kiddie movies. Chloe has already jumped into adult movies and is doing better than some adult actors.

My intentions where to write something in the style of my all time favorite film commentary track, which exists in The Criterion addition of The Sam Pekinpah film Straw Dogs 1971. A scholar named Stephen Prince who specializes in violence in film gives what is in essence a master class on the subject while pointing out thousands of little subtleties playing beneath the narrative, the effect is simply brilliant. I feel that my film watching strengths also lie in observing such subtleties, and Let Me In is chock-full of them. The reason is that director Matt Reeves does not insult the intelligence of the viewer by trying to explain every little thing to them. At the same time he uses visual and character behavior to tell the story. This makes Let Me In a joy for the sophisticated movie watcher. For those of you who feel that my essay is self indulgent, I must remind you that self indulgence is simply self expression, and all I am really doing is working on sharpening my writing skills. I had submitted this review about three weeks ago without this introduction, but I noticed that some people didn't really understand what I was actually intending. I also removed two paragraphs that in hind sight where kind of like boulders in the flow of the stream. One was about the camera work in the scenes of violence, the other was about what a great expressive face Kodi Smit-McPhee has. Hopefully people will find this version of the film essay to be a bit easier to read. Regardless of how this is accepted, at least I will always know that I am proud of it. In the end that is what really matters, but I still secretly hope some of you enjoy this film essay anyway. Thank you.

Virginal Footprints in the snow,
Left there by a mysterious vision.
Came out of that black shape,
Like a black cape,
In answer to my invitation...

He might as well be on the moon.

The main character in Let Me In is a 12 year old by named Owen who lives alone with his mother in a low rent apartment complex. Since Owen is only a child, he lacks the developed ability to express the many levels of suffering and confusion he is currently feeling. Like Owen, the film hides most of its meaning beneath its narrative, suggesting many dark ideas without ever explaining any of them to the audience. Owen is a frail middle school student without a single friend in the world. He is a timid boy that is being systematically bullied by the toughest guys in his grade. Owen is often shown wearing this puffy metallic silver jacket that gives him the look of an astonaut, while in his bedroom, an entire wall is given over to a giant mural of the lunar surface. The implication is obvious, Owen might as well be on the moon himself. Even God and country have turned their backs on Owen. There is a rather subversive use of a Ronald Reagan speech in the opening section of the film in which the president is glorifying the supposed righteousness of all Americans simply for being born an American. This fallacy is echoed a few scenes later when Owen is shown reciting The Pledge of Allegiance in class. While the entire class is saying 'One nation under God' in unison, Owen is struck on the right arm by a giant spit ball right on th word 'God'. In a later scene, Owen tells his mother that he cut his face during a fall in the school playground, when in reality the alpha male bully Ken had whipped Owen across the cheek with a broken off radio antenna. Rather then do the parental work necessary to fully uncover the reality of her sons painful situation, his mother just tells Owen to be more careful next time and then immediately launches into the dinner prayer. In Owen's bleak world, God and country have become perverted insults that only further alienate him. Even when we do see his mother up close her face is all out of focus, the rest of the time she is always shown from a distance. This visual depiction matches her near nonexistent parenting. Even Owen's father is nothing more then a voice on the other end of the phone that fails miserably to listen to what Owen is so desperately trying to tell him. Though none of these institutional and parental failing are ever being discussed anywhere in the dialogue itself, the audience still picks up on them through these various clues. The sad truth that is being revealed to us shows that like every other institution in Owen's life, his parents have done nothing for him at all, except to continually let him down.

Owen with Abby colored eyes.

Despite his ineffectuality, Owen has still managed to get himself into some disturbingly unsavory activities. In an act of transference Owen is shown bullying his own reflection at knife point in his bedroom mirror while wearing a clear plastic old man mask. It is a wonderfully ambiguous visual choice that suggest a number of intriguing possibilities. By wearing this mask over his face, is Owen being something that he is not, or is he being something that he might become in the future? This moment is immediately fallowed by the creepy business of spying on his various neighbors with his bedroom telescope. Since Owen is both interested and overwhelmed by the mysteries of sex, he quickly focuses his spying upon his sultry neighbor Virginia who is in the very beginning of make up sex with her boyfriend. Virginia is a strikingly beautiful woman in her mid 20's and is clearly the object of most of Owen's sexual fantasies. These various elements are laid bare without any narrative explanation, but beyond this, an even more curios visual effect takes place. The light shining back into Owen's eyes through the elongated telescope almost matches Abby's ghastly white vampire irises when she is in the throws of a feeding frenzy. This is a most ingenious visual cue, because it is at this point that Abby makes her first appearance in the film. From his bedroom window, Owen watches Abby get out of the passanger side of a moving van, at first she appears to be nothing more then a black silhouette. Then from out of this darkness emerges this cloaked angelic figure who proceeds to lead the way through the snow in her bare feet, looking for all the world like a homeless squatter. She is being fallowed by a 60 year old man who is struggling mightily with an oversized trunk held awkwardly in both arms. Through Owen's eyes we see much that is not revealed within the narrative itself, the most striking of which is that this barefooted child vagabond appears to be in charge of the old man.

Abby, the enternal adolescent.

It becomes clear when you watch the interaction between Abby and the 60 year old man, that the old man is still very much in love with her. He hates to disappoint Abby and is clearly jealous of her seeing 'that boy'. Abby and this old man have been a couple for a very long time, and their scenes together eerily answer the eternal quesion of how long Abby remains passionate with her human provider. Though their current situation seems to be that of a passive aggressive marriage rather then a fervid love affair, one gets the feeling that they have remained actively affectionate with one another a lot longer then one would care to think. What is clear is that Abby no longer seems physically attracted to her current boyfriend.
Just how long Abby has been a vampire is never really answered in the film, but we do know that she has been with the old man since he was a preteen himself, which is close to 50 years. Yet despite being possibly houndreds of years old, Abby still acts like a 12 year old kid, for one thing, she seems either unable or unwilling to provide for herself independently. This would all be fine if it wasn't for the fact that people keep dying around Abby at such an alarming rate. From the clues I gathered from watching both versions of this story, I have come to the conclusion that on average 10 people have to die each month for Abby to live. It is also clear that it is her human provider who has to do all of the dirty work for her. This means that in all the years he has been with Abby, the old man has had to either kill or dispose of the bodies of roughly 6000 people.
Richard Jenkins who plays the old man in Let Me In is the person who came up with the idea of wearing a dark colored plastic trash bag over his head with cut out eye slits when he captures his victims. The visual effect is as horrifying as it is wickedly subversive. Whether aware of it or not, Richard Jenkins had made this character look exactly like a KKK member, only with an opposing color for the hood. The subversion digs even deeper in that Richard Jenkins is only shown killing white people in this film. Even his method of killing matches a KKK lynching exactly, except that much like the opposing color of his hood, his victims are strung up to a tree upside down by their ankles rather then right side up by their necks. From here he sets a large plastic jug with a funnel in its top underneath his strung up victim and then cuts their jugular to drain their life blood into this crude take home receptacle.
Seeing a Rubix Cube become the catalyst of Abby and Owen's courtship was a deeply satisfying moment for me, because I am someone who is able to solve the cube in under three mintues. It is in this scene that Abby decides to pursue Owen, yet even this apparent innocent budding romance can be looked at in a more sinister level. Abby just had a nasty fight with the old man who had returned home with an appetizer rather then a meal. During the arguement, the old man tells Abby that he has grown tired of killing and might be getting sloppy on purpose in order to get caught. This leaves the door wide open for debate as to whether Abby has really fallen in love with Owen, or whether this is just a set of calculated moves to manipulate Owen into thaking the old mans place on 'the day shift'.

Leopards can not change their spots.

If Owen's beautiful neighbor Virginia is his sex siren, then Abby is Owen's otherworldly virginal Goddess. Abby represents everything that is meaningful, eternal, nurturing, and magical in Owen's deficient existence. The contrast between these two feminine influences in Owen's life is greater emphasized by constantly showing Virginia in an ornamental subservient roll to her rugged boyfriend Larry. Not for one second do we ever see Abby in a subservient roll to anyone in this film. There is something ultimately twisted about Abby's attack on Virginia. Virginia is after all the object of Owen's lust. It is not just that The Madonna is killing The Whore in this scene, it is that Owen's Madonna is killing Owen's Whore. It only took being in close proximity of a few drops of Owen's blood for Abby to attack Virginia in such a state of uncontrollable animalistic bloodlust, that it makes her vampirism seem like some kind of unstoppable hormonal reaction to puberty. Like everything else in this film, the visceral nature of Virginia's attack also effects the viewer on a subconscious level due to its underlying symbolism. Abby leaps on Virginia from the top of a tree, and then bites into her throat immediately. This is the exact same method that a leopard utilizes when attacking an antelope in the wild. Virginia is also wearing a fur coat at the time of the attack which further depicts her as being a jungle cats prey. These visual choices makes the attack look just like something one would see on Wild Kingdom.
When Abby talks to Owen, her words carry the same kind of symbolic connotations. Everything Abby says can be taken as literal prophetic truth. When they first meet, Owen points at his bedroom window and nervously tells Abby where he lives. You can clearly see all the flustered emotion on his face. Owen is so instantaneously attracted to this mysterious cloaked little girl that he nearly falls apart in her presence. Instead of reciprocating his longing, Abby tells Owen that she can not be his friend. This is actually a much truer statement then we could have ever realized. When she tells Owen that if it comes down to it she will help him fight the bullies, she backs this statement up with all the force of an army. What this implies about her constant insistence to Owen that 'she is not a girl' and is in fact 'nothing', staggers the imagination. Was she making these statements simply because she is a vampire, or is she in fact implying that she has no sexual organs at all? If there is one thing we do know for sure about Abby, when she says something she generally more then means it.

Home is where you're currently living at the time.

There is a curios line of dialogue that forced me to examine whether it was a cinematic flaw that went unnoticed by the director. After Abby scales the outside of the hospital building, she taps on the window and asks her human provider if she can enter his hospital room. The old man is unable to speak due to the self inflicted acid burns on his face, so Abby has to remain outside in the cold. There is a scene a little later in this movie in which Abby proves her devotion to Owen by showing him what will happen to her if she enters his home uninvited. The scene sets a clear timeline for how long it takes for Abby to reveal her vampire nature involuntarily to an outsider. Within just 15 seconds, Abby begins to shake uncontrollably, then by half a minute blood starts to gush from all parts of her body at once. Owen ultimately proves his love for Abby by frantically granting her permission to be in his house. Owen then runs over and cradles Abby in his arms and asks if she would of died had he not of said anything. She replies.
""I knew you wouldn't let me.""
Though this scene is remarkable for managing to be both moving and alarming at the same time, the problem with it is, is that we see Abby enter four other buildings uninvited. One location was the front reception desk of the hospital, another was a convenience store, then there was the apartment complex recreation room, and finally the indoor pool at the middle school in which she entered through the skylight to save Owen during the films climax. This paradox is one I am willing to concede with the simple excuse of 'home is where you are currently living at the time'. By being hospitalized in intensive care, that hospital room had become the surrogate home for the old man. Abby was now unable to enter this 'living space' without his permission.
Another potential problem was Owen's discovery of the photo booth pictures that showed Abby and the old man when he was a 12 year old boy himself. Since the events depicted in this film are shown to be taking place in 1983, this would mean that those photo booth pictures where taken some time in the mid 1930's. The question is, did photo booths even exist in 1935? What I found was that the photo booth was invented in 1889 by a man named Matthew Stiffens, and where later mass produced throughout America on March 27th 1927 by The Photomation Company. The discovery of the photo booth pictures not only checks out, but is astoundingly accurate. Due to the relative freshness of this national phenomena, taking a phto booth picture would have been a very popular thing to do in 1935.
If there is one clear error in the film that I am not willing to concede for any reason, it's the lack of proper police procedure demonstrated by the police sergeant. He had been finding bloodless bodies for several weeks, and had even witnessed Virginia burst into flames in her hospital bed when she was hit by the morning sunlight. Even his one and only suspect had fallen ten floors to his death after mysteriously being drained of blood himself. About the only clue he had left to go on was that a 12 year old girl was somehow tied to all this murder and death. The problem occurs when he hears the floorboards creak from inside of Abby's apartment. He quickly draws his fire arm, yells police, kicks down the door, stalks through the house for a good three minutes finding evidence of the murder victims, before eventually finding Abby sleeping in the bottom of the bath tub. Yet in all this time, he never does the one thing that any real cop would have done first thing before doing anything else...Call for back up. I really wish that the film would of shown the sergeant lose or break his police radio during the raid to fix this one trouble spot in the film, because the rest of the movie is damn near perfect.

Evil needs love too.

Once Abby decides to pursue Owen you will notice that she never takes her eyes off of him, unless it's to coyly look down in alluring shyness when the conversation borders on what makes her tick. In their very first scene together the audience becomes fully invested in seeing them end up as a couple. Yet as captivatingly beautiful as their romance is, Owen is eventually going to have to provide blood for Abby, and we already know what that entails. It is equally disturbing that she enters Owen's bedroom window like a succubus mere moments after she drained the blood out of her last long term partner. How subversive is it that thier bedroom conversation seems so tender and innocent when considering all the other implications? Out of the two movies, I definitely prefer how this moment was covered in Let The Right One In. I really miss the 'Bulleri bulleri bock' Swedish children's guessing game thing in which Eli has Oskar guess how many fingers she is tapping him with. I also wish that Abby would of caressed Owen's shoulder and arm the way that Eli caressed Oskar's in Let The Right One In. I find it weak that Owen was wearing a shirt in this scene, unlike Oskar who was shirtless and quit possibly naked. There is something ultimately dementedly satisfying about watching Eli indulge herself on touching the silky skin of her prey. The consolation for me is that there are two fantastic versions of the same tale, and I just happen to be wise enough to love both of them equally for the different strengths that they bring to the table.
Even though the viewer can interpret the subtleties in this film many different ways, I still believe that Abby has ultimately fallen in love with Owen. Why else would she have offered to eat his human candy when she knew it would make her choke? There is a real attraction that Abby feels for Owen that goes far beyond necessity. However, it is still so disastrously sad that Abby isn't going to turn Owen into a vampire and stay with him forever. The real tragedy of this story is that Owen  is going to grow old on Abby and eventually outlive his usefulness. Maybe that is how her evil really works. For unlike Owen's parents, school, God, or country, Abby is never going to let Owen down. This is the whole essence of the story. For once in his miserable little life, someone is actaully willing to do what ever it takes to make him feel like he actually matters. Unfortunately for Owen, that someone just happens to be a living dead monster. But in the end, who could really blame Owen for loving Abby? When you really consider the amazing way in which she rescues him at the end of the film, there really is no Earthly reason for him to look back at all. As for Abby, who could blame her for loving Owen?...After all, romance is for the young, and evil needs love too.",1298937600,2,19463,4.522430437251562
4319697,5,B004BLJQOK,"1983 in Los Alamos New Mexico at Winter time, 12 year old boy Owen (Kodi-Smith Mcphee) has been bullied many times for one night, a mysterious girl named Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) with her weird father (Richard Jenkens) move next door.

A surprisingly excellent yet un-needed remake of the 2008 Swedish masterpiece ""Let The Right One In"" when it's a re-adaptation of the Swedish novel from Joe Ajicde Linqvist for American audiences. In fact the author approved of this movie as a respectful re-adaption of the novel, this is Hammer's first movie in many years since the 70's as they are back in business. The film's acting is truly terrific even by Elias Koteas who plays the police officer in this movie and there's some good gore effects that are well done, it's also a kind of retro movie that takes you back to the 80's as there is even some pop songs from that time like David Bowie's Let's Dance and it's a very respectable remake that does things as both the same (But not all the way like that horrible Psycho remake) and new in some parts. It's by far one of the best horror remakes of all time as it earned it's critical acclaim, watch both films of Let The Right One In and this one at the same time to see how good both are. I applaud writer-director Matt Reeves of ""Cloverfield"" fame of doing a terrific American rendering similar to how ""Magificent Seven"" was a great American remake of ""Seven Samurai"" or ""Fistful of Dollars"" was a terrific American/Italian/Spanish remake of ""Yojimbo"".

This Blu-Ray gives off quality flawless picture and sound like you would see in a theater with good extras like audio commentary, featurettes, car crash sequence step-by-step, poster gallery and trailers.",1298851200,3,1908,4.658753709198813
4319698,5,B004BLJQOK,"This remake of the spectacular Swedish film ""Let The Right One In"" is worth watching.  Featuring a child vampire trapped forever at the physical and mental maturity of a 12 year old, it provides a nice twist on the vampire mythos and plenty of good bloody violence.  You will also get to enjoy the disturbing feeling that you have been somehow compromised by this film, probably because it gets you to cheer for a devil, just because she is cute and fun to watch.",1298764800,2,463,4.5
4319699,3,B004BLJQOK,"Honestly,, I liked the original better. The remake isn't any better than the original. It's acutally a duplicate copy much like Psycho remake. If u don't like subtitles than stick to the remake. the remake is kinda filmed dark meaning u couldn't hardly see the gore nor the background. The original was filmed bright and it captured the gore. The remake was actually a little less gorier than the original.",1298592000,,406,4.814285714285714
4319700,4,B004BLJQOK,"First, ""Let The Right One In"" was clearly superior to ""Let Me In"" even though the screenplays are virtually identical.  If you want to see one of the greatest Dark Urban Fantasy/Horror films ever made, rent the original and watch it with subtitles -- outstanding film.  ""Let Me In"" was a very good attempt at a remake, but the wooden acting of two unlikeable characters -- the ""father"" and the ""detective"" -- detracted from the film quite a bit.  Also gotta mention a glaring technical error regarding the detective character: after he kicks in an apartment door without a warrant he proceeds to clear the rooms with his pistol, a Colt 1911A1.  The 1911 is one of the most popular pistol platforms in the United States, and it is a single action automatic which requires the external hammer to be cocked before it will be capable of firing, and they are typically carried ""cocked and locked"" as they have both a thumb safety and a grip safety, allowing it to be carried safely let enabling it to be drawn and fired very quickly and accurately.  This is practically common knowledge amongst anyone with a basic level of experience with firearms.  You would think that at least one technical advisor would've noted the fact that the detective's 1911 was not cocked and thereby incapable of being fired as he cleared the apartment.  Not deducting a point for that, even though it irritated me.

This remake was surprisingly good considering all the negative reviews.  Sure, not as great as the original, but face reality folks -- the average American doesn't like foreign films and especially doesn't like reading subtitles, so if it wasn't for this retelling many folks would miss out on this great movie and it might fade to obscurity.  Those who like it might be compelled to seek out the original, and I encourage them to do so.  Like I said before, screenplays are virtually identical and the differences are few.  Acting was not as bad as some reviewers would have you believe.  I thought it was worthwhile.  4 Stars.",1298592000,2,2020,4.734285714285714
4319701,5,B004BLJQOK,"This movie has good atmosphere, interesting characters, good dialog, good writing, and cool FX. What more could you ask for? The friendship that develops between the two main characters is an intriguing mix of creepy and touching. There are also a few surprises in the plot that made an old story feel new again. This movie is not shy about showing gore, but doesn't revel in it either, knowing exactly what to show and what to leave to the imagination.

Even though this is almost a shot for shot remake,it lacks the quaint charm of the original. The two children are both outcasts and there is a sweetness about their relationship that is not present in the remake. The original did not have the Satanic overtones as this film does. Why the filmmaker thought he needed to set this film in the 1980s, I'll never know. It is just distracting. Just because there is a Rubik's cube doesn't mean you need to set your film in the 1980s.

The pacing of the original is slow but that is how their narrative unwinds and it could be a European non-Hollywood thing. And perhaps the slow pace of the original is meant to be a character itself the isolation of cold dark Scandinavian winters. This remake is slow because the filmmaker cannot tell his own story and is literally using the same shots to make this film without good character development or plot development.
I would not classify the original as a Horror film in the American sense of slasher/satanic films as this one is.

Many films using CG fall into this trap. On one level, it's interesting that she can move like a quick spider, but it just looks like so many other CG effects. Of course that's a tiny part of the film, but it sticks in my mind as a weak point. In the original she just drops from a tree or something, and it flowed better (for me). That touch of obvious digital articulation in the re-make took me out of the movie for a second.

4319704,4,B004BLJQOK,"This is an enjoyable film, set in 1982 - a somewhat worthwhile remake of the original Swedish Let the Right One In (Lt den Rtte Komma In, 2008). The films are based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, written in 2004. Anyway, you can see the indecent haste with which the American production followed the Swedish - but this time the remake does have its charms - particularly in the young cast chosen. Chloe Moretz (Abby) and Cody Smit-McPhee (Owen) work  very well together - and casting generally is excellent - so the band of bullies who make Owen's life miserable are completely convincing. So is their demise, I guess!
What an interesting actor Cody Smit-Mcphee is!  He reminds me a little of a young Nicholas Hoult - so delicate and innocent - so it is a surprise to learn that his father has been a wrestler in his time, and is currently playing a leader of a bikie gang in a popular American series (who name I forget as it has yet to screen here in Australia.)
Finally, it should be noted that John Ajvide Lindqvist has described Let Me In as ""a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel, for which I am grateful.""  Who could argue with the author?",1298332800,2,1182,4.43778801843318

4319706,4,B004BLJQOK,"Many remakes, to which we have all been witness to in the last decade, have always been criticized even before it hit theaters; the main reason for that: If it's good then there's no reason to make another one, especially for classic movies or favorites by fans.

`Let Me In' is the American version of `Let The Right One In' which is the Swedish version and obviously the original as well. The mood is identical to both movies, something in which director Matt Reeves does a great job keeping up with the same pace as the original film, and the acting was very well pulled off even though there was no need for overacting. If I was to be asked who could play the part of Oskar (Kre Hedebrant, the boy from the original version) I would of named the kid from `The Road', Kodi Smit-McPhee, who does a perfect portrayal of the youngster who gets bullied pitiless and befriends with the vampire girl.

One thing one can expect from this movie, being a remake of a foreign flick, is that the special effects will be better and gorier, in which both categories exceeded.

4319707,4,B004BLJQOK,"The vampire mythology is as old as the hills. Hollywood has spent nearly a century cataloguing all of the different facets of the crypt-sleeping, fanged beasts of the night. From Nosferatu to John Carpenter's Vampires to Twilight, the gamut has been run...and run...and run. In fact, this film is just a remake of a foreign success. So does it stand on its own two feet? Yes. Thanks to its deft production and characters. LET ME IN is a dazzling, morbid little picture with two stellar young leads at its center and while it does occasionally wallow in bucket-loads of gore, it has something of a real heart as well.
That's not to say that it isn't dark as dark can be. It is. The visuals are stark and haunting. From the opening frame of a cavalcade of police cars and an ambulance jouncing through snowy hills at night, to the violent finale, this is a film that positively immersed viewers in its grim world. This is not a film for children. It contains overwhelmingly graphic blood-letting sequences and one very nasty facial burn. There is also a cycle-of-abuse subplot that doesn't end in what one might call a ""healthy"" fashion. Overall, there is a lot of tension to be had in the film. Several scenes are stand-alone and amazing, begging for repeat viewing. One encounter at a gas station is rewind-right-away and re-watch good.
The lead characters are amazing. Chloe (Hit-Girl) Mortiz knocks this one out of the park. She is believable, graceful, and just plain captivating. The boy keeps up. The old detective and the father are also very convincing. Their shopworn character-action vibes suited the tone of the film. Though their relationship is the definition of unnatural, the two young kids will have most audience members feeling for their plight by the time the credits roll. It is amazing that they are as young as they are and able to convey such adult emotion.
This is a very dreary but paradoxically energetic film with a lot of surprises and an excellent score. The production values rock. The story is rather fresh and engaging. If you have the stomach for some very mean-spirited and occasionally view-through-your-fingers gore, you'll experience the most unconventional ""love""/coming of age story of the past decade, even if it is a remake.",1298160000,4,2264,4.852713178294573
4319708,3,B004BLJQOK,"What? You can't watch a foreign film with subtitles? You're too dumb that you won't get it? You're a ""movie illeterate""? You absolutly need to have every foreign film remade in its american version in order to appreciate it?

Of course, ""Let Me In"", the U.S. version, has more of everything (more gore, more special effects, more explanations, more music) and less subtleties. Of course, like all american remake, it suffers from a sad case of hypocritical puritanism (those who saw the sweedish version know what i'm refering to).

Instead of wasting his precious talent in remaking a foreign cult film (a nevertheless great remake that is uncalled for), the american director should have done an original story. Of course, he changed the structure a bit so that he can say that his version is different (the arguable and overlong mystery surrounding a secondary character as the movie begins). And also, he took away a little detail that was so eerie and cool in the european version: Eli, the sweedish girl vampire, flys in an fast, subtle and elegant way as she goes from a module to her new friend (the american Abby simply jumps out of focus). Why take away such a spooky detail?

And as good as Chloe Moretz is as Abby, the american girl vampire, and she is sublime, i feel that Lina Leandersson is way more ""peculiar"" in her ways and her looks in the european version. Those who've seen ""Let The Right One In"" have to give me that one. The sweedish boy was also more ""natural"", i feel. Is look was ""picturesque"" if i may say so but it belonged in the story. The american boy, Kodi Smith-McPhee, is good and i believed him, but it feels like he was cast more because he looked like his european counterpart, Kare Hedebrant.

No really, the sweedish version has absolutly NOTHING to be ashamed of. Nothing. It is as good as it can be. The special effects, the acting, the structure and the cinematography are superb. And it is only two or three years old. It certainly didn't need a remake. The U.S. version, as good as it may be (and it is good), almost feels like an insult to the intelligence of the american viewers.

You don't believe me? Try and find a way to see the sweedish version. Have an open mind about subtitles and about actors and actresses you don't know. I swear, you'll be the winner.

There are other ways to make movies, you know. A film doesn't have to be ""american made"" in order to be good.

4319710,5,B004BLJQOK,"Having not seen the original Swedish ""Let The Right One In"", which I understand to be a classic itself, I went into this film expecting a decent two hours of entertainment. Once the end titles began, I was convinced that this is the BEST vampire tale ever put on screen since ""Interview With The Vampire"" some 16 years ago. This is how vampires should be portrayed...tragic and lonely figures cursed by their affliction and immortality. Sure..we've seen the current trends of highly stylized and hip vampires that ""glitter in the sun"" or look like they came off the cover of Teen People magazine. They're over-romanticized and make you want to be one of them, as opposed to fearing and, more importantly, pitying them.

I have a hard time classifying this as a ""horror"" film. It's got a fair share of frights, but the real story here is one of innocence lost and the naivite of young love. The relationship between Owen and Abby is one that is severely lacking in todays society where we tend to oversexualize our pre-teens to the point of nausea. Theirs is a sweet and self-sacrificing kind of love that is genuinely the heart of this film. It's a beautiful love story between two kids that is wrapped up in ""horror film"" packaging.

Chloe Moretz is going to be HUGE one day. Her performance as Abby is incredible and earnest. She plays the part of a person of considerable years, yet trapped in the body of a child, perfectly. You see it in her eyes and in every inflection of her tone when she speaks. She IS Abby in this film.

Kodi Smit-McPhee, for an Australian actor, really does his part well for his age. It's his story that actually provide the hardest parts to watch with regards to his torment at the hands of some school punks. He's odd looking, off puting, and a bit dark..but you immediately sympathize with him and his circumstances.

The adult cast, while solid and well established actors, really take a back seat to these two fine young actors.

I've no doubt the original Swedish film is just as wonderful and I look forward to seeing it, but when the author himself states that this version is another superbly executed telling of his original novel and screenplay, then I'll take his word for it.

If nothing else....it's great to finally know what happens to a vampire that enters a home uninvited. I've always wanted an answer to that ""what if"" scenario since I was a kid, yet never had a clue where to turn.

The direction is highly stylized and brooding, but not sacrificing any of the performances or pacing. You are SO into the story, you don't even notice how quickly two hours goes. It's enchanting, enthralling, and poetic...yet disturbing at times. It really is hard to use a single word to describe this film other than ""wonderful"".",1297900800,4,2765,4.642126789366054

4319714,5,B004BLJQOK,"After all the romantic fluff and angst of the ""Twilight"" movies, ""Let Me In,"" a remake of the Swedish film ""Let the Right One In,"" puts the vampire back into its traditional cinematic conventions even though director Matt Reeves transplants the location to New Mexico in 1983.  The title relates to one of the ground rules of vampirism:  vampires must be invited in before they can pounce.

Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz, ""Kick-Ass"") meets Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, ""The Road""), the product of a broken home and the victim of brutal bullying at school, in the courtyard of their apartment complex.  They both appear to be twelve-year-olds, but Abby says they can never be friends.  Her behavior is odd.  She walks in the snow barefoot and never goes to school.  Still, the two form a bond against the background of a series of gruesome murders.

Horror movies seldom achieve the level of ""Let Me In.""  It all comes down to a solid script with believable performances.  I have no problem with screenwriters and directors tweaking the vampire legend to give their movies an interesting spin.  What bothers me is a vampire that is more yuppie sauntering around in daylight than nocturnal bloodsucker.  In this film, Abby follows in the grand tradition of vampires.  Her evident victim, Owen, actually encourages her friendship and she soon becomes his protector.  But what will eventually happen to Owen?

Ms. Moretz is very good as Abby -- charming, creepy, scary, sympathetic, savage as the plot dictates.  She sells her character.  Director Reeves wisely duplicates the frigid atmosphere of the Swedish original.  The graphic scenes are shot with a minimum of light to keep them both frightening and mysterious.  Often, American remakes of foreign films fall short, but ""Let Me In"" retains the bleak, haunting mood of the original while pepping up the pace and incorporating more action.  It is a well-made movie worth your attention.

Bonus features on both the R-rated Blu-ray and DVD editions include audio commentary with writer/director Matt Reeves, making-of and art of special effects featurettes, unrated deleted scenes, and a step-by-step look at the creation of one of the movie's action sequences.",1297814400,2,2201,5.075208913649025

4319720,5,B004BLJQOK,"Let's get one thing clear immediately; Let Me In is a superb film that is beautifully shot and the actors, specifically the two very young leads, are perfection. Kodi Smit-McPhee, who plays Owen, the physically weak young boy who is under constant attack from three older boys, is so real and so believable that you can't help but feel for him and you, as the viewer, either fall into one of two categories; you are either reminded of him because you were like him... or because you once, long ago, tormented some kid in the way that he is tormented.

Chloe Grace Moretz, the beautiful and amazingly talented young girl who is both Abby and Vampire, is so captivating and stunning in this role that it will certainly be a daunting task for her to ever out-do herself here. However... I have a feeling that we have only been witness to the beginning of her skills as an actress.

By now you should know the history of this movie and what it is based on... w/ out regurgitating all of that yet again, let me just say that this movie will pull you into its story and you won't even realize it while it's happening. The pacing in this film is perfect. Subtle things happen that are so wonderful that you really need to view this movie multiple times to take them all in.

Without giving away any spoilers for those who have not seen this yet I will just say that one of my favorite parts is when Abby is talking to Owen about the bullies at school. She tells him he has to hit back. Hard. Owen keeps making excuses and asking 'What if it doesn't work?' Abby then tells him, 'I'll help you.' He says, ""But you're a girl.'

She then gently reaches out her hand and touches him and says, 'I'm a lot stronger than you think.' The look on her face in that moment is priceless and difficult to properly convey in words, but it is film making at its finest.

Over time Owen begins to unravel the mysteries of young Abby and though he is scared... even calling his soon-to-be-divorced father and asking him if evil is real... he also realizes that he loves Abby. After yet another attack by his tormentors at the school swimming pool, Owen is saved by Abby and Owen realizes he has only one choice... to spend his life with her.

It's difficult for me to characterize this as a *Horror* movie, because it is also a love story and a coming-of-age movie. Don't let that deter you though... this is one of those rare times when a movie crosses genres and succeeds on all levels. I rented this and watched it 3 times, returned it and bought the DVD.

4319722,4,B004BLJQOK,"It's rare that a remake equals the original but whether or not you're more of a fan of the original movie ""Let The Right One In"" or the remake, both films offer a unique creepy film about Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee from ""The Road"")who finds himself bullied, alienated from his peers and his own family as he is caught in the crossfire of divorce. He befriends a new girl named Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz in a marvelous performance)who is a vampire and while Owen suspects something is off with the girl he bonds with her immediately inspite of the hositility of her ""father"" (Richard Jenkins of ""The Visitor"" and ""Six Feet Under"" fame). There's not a huge deviation in the basic plot but the interpretation and portrayal of the characters brings a different element to the story.

Perfectly cast, ""Let Me In"" captures the odd vibe of the original film while adding its own textures. Director Matt Reeves in adapting the novel and original screenplay turns the story some what on its head by telling it in flashback form. Set during the certainty of the Reagan presidency in the 1980's, ""Let Me In"" also nicely captures the atmosphere of innocence and cynicism that existed pre-9/11.

""Let Me In"" is a nice return to form of former horror stalwart Hammer Films. For those folks NOT familiar with Hammer, the original studio produced a series of horror classics but then drifted into cheap, unimaginative sequels that sullied their name.

""Let Me In"" receives a marvelously creepy looking home video transfer. Where the image is soft it was an intentional choice and, for the most part, the images are crystal clear and sharp as a vampire's tooth.

There are also some really cool extras for fans who like those sort of things including a commentary by director Reeves who doesn't shy away from discussing the marvelous original film. Reeves discusses differences between the two films including scenes he included from the original novel that didn't appear in the original Swedish filmLet the Right One In [Blu-ray].

We get a number of very good featurettes including a making-of, visual effects and car crash sequence featurette that give us plenty of behind-the-scenes info. We also get a picture-in-picture ""dissection"" of the movie including footage exclusive to this feature as well as some recycled footage from other featurettes. We also get deleted scenes including the scene that played on the internet and was in some trailers of Abby being turned into a vampire. This last deleted scene is presented in HD but most are in SD.

The Swedish original is a marvelously creepy mixture of character study and horror film. Although the remake is less subtle in some ways than the original film, director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"") expands on the characters in some unique and subtle ways missing from the original film as well.

Owen a lonely 12 year old whose parents are divorcing, lives with his drunkard of a mother. He is also a magnet for every bully in his school who torment him mercilessly. Abby is the newly moved in 12 year old girl next door and sensing a kindred spirit in each other they develop a special bond. The twist is, Abby has been 12 for a very long time and is a cold blooded monster who needs human blood to survive.

i will not detail any more of the ins and out of this movie's story and although there is blood and violence, it is mostly kept in check and even though the film retains the curious ending of the original film, it leaves you to wonder-what does the future hold for Owen and Abby.

i was also pleasantly surprised that the movie was directed by Matt Reeves of ""Cloverfield"" infamy. The movie that was filmed by someone doing the jitterbug while riding a skateboard.

If you loved the original, (which I did) then this remake is a worthy bookend to the first. I highly recommend this film to fans of supernatural horror with a humanist sensibility.

4319738,5,B004BLJQOK,"I checked this out because I'm a fan of Chloe Moretz. and as usual, she steals the movie. She is such a fantastic actress, and has a bright career a head of her.

The story is of a boy, Owen, who pretty much lives a sheltered life. His mom is a religious person, who has a drinking problem, and thinks she controls Owen's life, but pretty much ignores him.  At school, he's a target of bullies and doesn't really have any friends. The one day, a mysterious girl, Abby, moves in the same apartment complex (right next door) as him and Owen just sees her at night.  Abby has secrets that she wanted to keep to herself. As the story unfolds, Abby tells Owen her secrets and pretty much Owen finds out that Abby is a vampire.  The two are friends, and Abby tells Owen that he has to stand up to the bullies. Abby and Owen have a wonderful friendship.  That's all I really want to say about the plot. I've left some things out, but I want the viewer to discover the secrets for themselves.

The boy who plays Owen does a nice job. We can't help but to feel sorry for him when the bullies torment him. I do have to say that when the bullies were tormenting Owen, that was kind of hard to watch.  Owen is a bit creepy at times, but that just adds to his character.

Chole Moretz plays Abby, and as usual, she steals whatever movie she is in. Moretz plays Abby perfectly.  Abby is dark and gritty, and keeps her secrets. As the story unfolds, we can't help but to feel all of the emotions that Abby is feeling. I can't say enough good things about Moretz acting skills. She's a natural talent who has a fantastic and bright acting career in front of her.

It's been said that this is a horror movie.....yes and no. It's violent, really violent at times, but I'm not really willing to call it a horror movie. Let's call it a very, very violent drama movie.  It's a story of friendship. The writing, acting, and camera angles as perfect.  This was such a great movie to see, I do plan on getting it.

At its heart, the movie is about a relationship between a lonely young boy from a troubled home and a sad, lonely monster in the shape of a beautiful young girl.

4319741,3,B004BLJQOK,"After having watched Let The Right One In I was excited to see this film.  I read that the director/writer had made his own version of the book(not the original movie) so I expected a bit of difference between films.  What he really did was copy the exact same script as Let The Right One In, change one scene, add another and slap his name on it.  Throughout the film the dialogue exchanges are literally the exact same as Let The Right One In.  Unfortunately, the translation does not work very well in English and the dialogue can sometimes sound unbelievable. Shame on Reeves for not just writing his own version of the story.
I give this three stars only because if Let The Right One In didn't exist, this would be a good film.  Of course, if that film did not exist, this one wouldn't either.",1296864000,3,798,4.401360544217687
4319742,3,B004BLJQOK,"Right off the bat, I will say if you like this you should check out the original.  While they are very similar (obviously), I just feel the original put the story together so much better.  The relationship between the two central characters seemed much more natural and realistic in the original.  I think that the actress playing ""Abby"" in this version is trying to be creepy.  Also, the CGI when she attacks someone is really not very good.  The movements are disjointed and not fluid.  Being that the shots were usually from a distance, why not just get a gymnast to hop around and do the stunts?  For example, when she climbed the tree it looked awful.

One thing I did prefer in this version over the original is that the kid playing the main bully was actually better.  Also, Owen/Oscar in this version, while not ""better"" than the original was pretty good and convincing.

Abby vs. Eli is no contest as I mentioned earlier.  Eli in the original is MUCH better!  Also, the cinematography of the original and the snowy landscapes were fantastic.  This version has that slightly washed out ""scary"" look that actually takes you out of the movie more than putting you in the movie.

I'm not a huge fan of remakes, but I'm not a guy that decides I won't like something just because it is a remake.  I loved the remakes of Invasion of the Body Snatchers ('78), The Thing ('82), The Fly ('86), The Blob ('88) and more recently I really enjoyed Dawn of the Dead ('04).  In this case, the remake was just not able to reach the level of excellence that the original did.  Original 5 stars!

Extremely well done relationships between the boy and ""girl"" - perhaps even better then the original.  The old photobooth picture was a great addition in hinting to the background.  This version really focuses on the courting process the vampire was engaged in with the boy. Moving emotional story that is well acted.",1296777600,3,460,5.0131578947368425
4319744,5,B004BLJQOK,"My review is going to be rather disorganized only because this movie is so different from most movies I've seen. ""Let Me In"" left me speechless. After seeing the trailer and hearing so much negative buzz about how it was just a simple American remake of a breathtaking foreign film, I wasn't too excited to see this one. In fact, it was only by chance that I ended up with a Blu-Ray copy in my hands. I'd originally tried to watch the original several times, and have only made it all the way through once... I wasn't impressed. I didn't see the hype. I might not have had the patience, or something, but I typically have quite good taste in movies and watch hundreds of good movies, foreign and Hollywood, every year.

Let me just sum up Let Me In using a few choice, but exquisitely fitting words:
Atmospheric... dark... intense... ambient... even nostalgic at times... Endearing... Entrancing... boundary-free.

The soundtrack was perfect. Extremely intense and sad, but soft enough to accentuate the movie itself.

The cinematography was also indescribably good. Greig Fraser's skill was impressive. It could not have been shot any better, and the actual diversity of the camera shots should be appreciated as much as the seamlessness with which they're used. This movie is also much darker than the original. MUCH darker. Everything about it emphasizes this difference, from the facial expressions to the events with ""The Father"".

Many criticize Let Me In's similarity to the Swedish original, but I can't help but disagree. While some scenes are very similar, they remain completely different. Let Me In actually stays more faithful to the book than the Swedish version, and even when the scenes are, dialogue-wise, identical, the acting and the all-around ambiance are incomparable.

I can't put into words how much this movie pulled at my heartstrings and touched me. I'm 16 years old now. Even though I've never thought much of McPhee as an actor, the quality he brought to his role as Owen was unbeatable. He reminded me of... me. I'm sure there's some part of every guy that can relate to Owen, and part of every female viewer that relates to someone like him... I was a shrimp when I was 12; I was treated like an insect. I would have given anything to simply be protected, and to have someone like Abby in my life; god knows I didn't have the confidence to make friends with much of anyone when I was Owen's age. I'm a 6'5"" rugby player now, but I still feel like that little kid sometimes.

In a nutshell, this movie sends me back to the emotions and the intensity of loneliness and life when I was Owen's age.
The movie, all in all, has a very sad story. The ending brings good closure to it, but when you start to think deeper into how it ended, you can only think of how truly cold and lonely it would be to be Owen. I can't comment anymore on those implications so as to not give it away.",1296777600,5,2907,4.613152804642167

I recently had the living hell scared out of me after watching Case 39. I was thinking this movie might rival that one, but boy was I wrong. I'm not even sure when I was supposed to be scared during this movie. Very, very weak. More of a love story than a horror movie.

I don't even like scary movies, so I know a scary movie when I see one. I really wish this had been the 99 cent movie, because we definitely just threw away $3.99!!!",1296777600,6,511,4.0495049504950495
4319746,5,B004BLJQOK,"First off, if you're comparing this film to the original, that's a mistake. I like the original because I was surprised at the simplicity of it. It was simple, straight forward film making and it was able to convey what all fine films convey, an emotional experience.
  Let me in is its own film and if compared to the original I would say that this version also created an emotional experience, but a much deeper and richer one. Neither version of the novel stick to it loyally. In the novel, the character of the old man who goes out in hunt for blood for Eli or Abby or whoever is a pedophile, doscovered by Eli when he was an older man, not when he was a child. Neither movie makes that clear. There is a separate plot line in the novel about an older friend of Oskars whose mother is having a relationship with the officer in charge of capturing the old man(Elis renfield) that is not touched on in either film. Also, in the novel the old man returns as a vampire monster because Eli/Abby does not break his neck after drinking his blood at the hospital window.
  I think the the remake captured the tone of the loneliness that both Owen and Abby feel as a result of her vampire existence and his lack of friends. Abby gives Owen the ability to care about himself and Owen gives Abby the ability to let herself care about somebody else. Most excellent. Simple,yet very affective.",1296777600,2,1384,4.415686274509804

Now, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of very good and inspiring movies out there. In the end though, it's all about personal preference. That said, LET ME IN is truly a movie that will tug on your heart. How can you not feel for Abby and all she has to go though and deal with, even though she's a vampire!!!! I haven't watched many movies that are able to take me though the full range of my emotions. A movie that can make you sad, cry, laugh, cheer, love, (sometimes jump and shout), but most of all make you think, is truly an AWESOME movie!!!!! That's the main reason I rarely write a review for a movie I've seen, because few movies can do all of that for me. I do however, recommend lots of movies I've seen to other people in person. I don't think many peole will not like LET ME IN. It is truly a Beautiful movie in every aspect, as far as movies are concerned. I watch ninty-five percent of my movies in blu-ray. And, this blu-ray is superb in picture quality and sound. I try to get people who really enjoy movies to invest in a decent set-up. I know times are hard but I still recommend this anyway.

4319748,4,B004BLJQOK,"Why oh why would they remake this movie again? I was expecting it to be better than the first (Let the right one in) which I must say was a great film, even with the voice dubbing.
I do admit that the special effects were a bit better although limited as they were, I would have loved to have seen much more. Example; Dropping or flying from a ten story window. Why would they cut such a cool scene?  Also; we had a chance to see a flash back to Abby's beginnings, but it was deleted and very short. This film could have been so much better and with a little effort would have left us setting in our sets saying WOW.
If you haven't seen the original (Let the right one in) then I suggest that you get this film and enjoy. But I would also suggest that you find and rent the original and compare. Much like watching the original (Hills have eyes) compared to the newer version, it's basically the same film with a few added effects and some dropped scenes.",1296777600,2,955,4.190217391304348

4319750,5,B004BLJQOK,"Owen is a boy that doesn't seem to have that much in life. He is bullied and not really seen by his parents, leading him to dream of other things. Amongst those dreams is something dark and hard, allowing him to see himself sticking a knife into those who pick on him. He also looks out his window and sees other people and there he envisions himself with another role. This play and this want leads him to see a 12 year old girl named Abby, whom he seems to like right away. Never mind the fact that she smeels different and never mind the fact that she doesn't wear shoes in the winter or know what a rubix cube is. she is something that he desires and that sees him as someone. She smiles after a time and she gives him advice, telling him to hit those who hit him harder than he dares. Still, she also says she cannot be his friend because she is not a she at all.
what does all this mean? Is Owen finding love or another dark hole? The questions and the answers are what makes Let Me In so good and then some.

When it comes to Let Me In, the book and the foreign release are already in the books. They are good, too, adn they have a lot to bank on. Still, this release adds more, and makes its own remarks. Whether it is on the man that Abby lives with or the way things transpire with the acid and the man, it all takes its own shape. Even if you have seen it you will see more, and the more is great. The hospital, for example, shows you more of Abby and the first attack shows you more as well. you also have a new way of ""collecting,"" and a new presentation.
It all changes.

I personally thought this was good and that it was its own thing. It had its own comments and its own style, making it make its own way forward. From the special effects window to the way the people are seen, there are changes and there are staples that are either needed and stay or that are played with and go. The people that live across from here are changed and yet they are still there, and these things are good and they leave other ways to see. I also like the way everything rounds to a close, with it changing and yet keeping things open, allowing it to be more. I like this as well, and I like the way that it is all seen. It makes a great dynamic and a horror movie, playing to all those invovled. It really deseves a watch.

I admit I was afraid of this at first. I learned quickly, however, and this was good. It said that I would want to see and I did, and that left things in a nice place. It also left me with a 4.5 - 5 star movie, and a shocked look on my face. I expected good but not this. I am pleased and then some.

I watch many movies, searching for the ones that I can recommend to my friends and co-workers without hesitation; this one is on that short list. To classify it as ""yet another vampire movie"" is incorrect; it is a dark, romantic story that happens to have a vampire in it. The acting is superb. The story is very much in line with the original. If you prefer movies that utilize plot, pacing, and story to achieve success, then watch this. If you prefer movies that are as shallow as a reality television celebrity, see something else. My apologies to the people who made ""Snakes on a Plane."" I enjoyed it even though I was ridiculed by my wife and daughter for purchasing it; it didn't require much thought, but was entertaining.

4319754,2,B004BLJQOK,"Hackneyed vampire story with a script and directing that was predictable, disjointed and lacking in creative storytelling that, sadly,  was potentially possible in this unique juxtaposition of two misunderstood needy lovers. Opportunity missed! Instead we just get shallow personifications of characters such as parents, guardians, caretakers, professionals and teachers that are presented as incompetent expendable meals that have no more depth than a shadow. These people were given such small stereotypic roles that we seem to care little whether they die or do nothing all film long. Just not real! The rest of the unreality of this film was the heavy reliance upon ripping people apart which, again, did nothing to advance our understanding of our misunderstood protagonists.

Two stars for the cinematography and Chlo's presence. Although, wasted in a movie where her talents were diminished by very fakey blood; CGI teeth; bare feet endlessly filmed (another reason why Americans need to wear sandals more often) and posing for the camera with ""the look"" punctuated by limited scripted lines that seemed almost tritely comical. She needs a new agent.

You would think that a nearly 1000 year old 12 year old vampire would have experienced love at least once in that long life span. Also, you would think that raiding blood banks and hospital blood freezers would be a whole lot quicker and safer source of hemoglobin (you know - AIDS; other viruses and pathogens would be screened out). Also, what does a Rubik's cube have to do with innately primitive blood hunting savagery - there's  just not a whole lot of abstract creative intelligence transfer between the two activities.

The scene where Owen is on the phone with his dad is so beautifully written, directed and especially acted by Kodi Smit Mcphee, that you might find yourself wiping tears from your eyes. This movie is very slow moving, but this is deliberate as it builds this overwhelming feeling of dread that becomes almost unbearable.  Part of it is because you care so much about these characters but part of it is because there is a realism about the whole thing that makes the movie that much more powerful.  No sparkly vampires here!

4319764,4,B004BLJQOK,"The cover of the DVD quotes Stephen King as saying this is ""the best American horror film in the last 20 years.""  Too bad it's really an American remake of the Swedish film Let The Right One In.  If you haven't seen the original and don't like movies with subtitles, don't worry.  The American remake will suffice for you.  It's the eerily slow tempo and oddities of both films that really make you shiver.  It's the story of a lonely young boy, the victim of bullies at his school, who befriends a young female vampire who moves in next door in his apartment complex.  They both give each other a bit of confidence, despite the consequences a friendship between them could cause.

The differences between the two films are probably numerous to some who have obsessed over them, but as far as the storyline goes, they are pretty much the same.  Obviously, there's a bit of emotion lost from having to read the subtitles which non-Swedish speaking Americans will get to enjoy in this film.  But it's not all about the dialogue.  There are long bouts of scary silence in both films where you don't always want to know what's happening (but you do), and you don't need someone talking to tell you. The two lonely friends sitting outside in the snow on a jungle gym beneath the yellow security light plays on our emotions just as much as seeing Owen, the young boy, get picked on by his bullies.

Since I've seen both films, I'm going to tell you what I liked better about the Americanized version.  First, I didn't mind the lack of Owen's father in the movie.  His scenes are brief in the original, but not really needed for anything other than to establish is parents are separated but Owen still has a relationship with both.  The lack of a father figure in his life is not really the reason Owen is such a weak character that always gets picked on at school.  Again, dialogue quickly establishes that his parents are getting divorced.  There's only a phone call to his father in the remake, where he reaches out to him to ask if there is such a thing as evil.

I also thought Abby's caregiver played much more of a part in this film and we really got to see his conflict play out.  There are differences in his ""killing"" scenes in both films, but the reason behind them is the same.  In the remake, however, we see that the victims live in the same apartment complex and Owen knows who they are by watching them through a telescope in his bedroom window.

All in all, it's not a bad remake.  Like I said, if you haven't seen the Swedish version, you won't be missing anything.  The dynamic and sadness of both films is definitely there, even the bizarre ending which you'd never expect.  The one thing that I didn't like about the remake though was Owen asking Abby if she was a vampire.  I also didn't like the scenes where we got to see her face after she had fed and her appearance and eyes had become more monster-like.  NOT seeing this sort of teases your mind and increases the intensity, and while Abby doesn't answer Owen's question, there was no need to establish what she was.  What's more important is that Owen doesn't care about that.  He only cares about her friendship.

Definitely worth a watch if you have not (or even have) seen the original, or if you enjoy a ""good"" vampire flick.  I agree with King that it's one of the best horror films lately.  Too bad it's not really ours.",1296518400,4,3397,4.449838187702265
4319765,5,B004BLJQOK,"I adore the Swedish film Let the Right One In and I was highly skeptical about the idea of an Americanized remake. The original was such a poetic, touching film I wondered how anyone could hope to improve on it. When it was announced that the director of Cloverfield was behind it and the title had been dumbed-down for American audiences (I realize that translations being what they are, the title may be appropriate, but you can't deny it sounds like a dumbed-down version of the original), I lost all faith in it until director Matt Reeves cast two of the most talented child actors working today. Whenever a film is remade, I watch it and judge it on its own merit. When reviewing a remake I don't like to compare it with the original, but I found it impossible to not break my own rule several times here.

The setting is Los Alamos, New Mexico, 1983. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a 12-year-old boy, seemingly with no friends, frequently bullied at school, and with no supporting parent figure to come home to. One night, outside his apartment building, Owen meets a young girl named Abby (Chlo Moretz), who has just moved in next door with a mysterious man that Owen assumes is her father (Richard Jenkins). It's no spoiler to tell you that Abby is a vampire.

Character actor Elias Koteas plays a policeman, who is basically a composite character of several minor characters from the Swedish version. While it's not a shot-for-shot remake, Reeves sticks very close to the Swedish film. Since I've never read the book, I can't be sure that additional elements in this film are Reeves' own ideas or simply ideas taken from the book so I ask you to forgive me if I credit him with something that should be credited to the novelist John Ajvide Lindqvist.

So, what has changed? Obviously the setting has moved from Sweden to New Mexico. Some of have commented that since Reeves didn't differentiate from the look of the Swedish version this change was pointless. I'm not offended by it as it doesn't change the story at all. The characters names have changed from Oskar and Eli to Owen and Abby. Once again, I find no quarrel here as their names aren't intact but their character is. Owen and Abby don't differ very much in character from their foreign counterparts and I like that Reeves didn't attempt to tweak with the characterization. Structurally, it's been altered too; the opening scene is changed, which seems to just be a way to capture the attention of an American audience quicker. Let Me In begins with a bang, while Let the Right One In draws you in as it progresses. The bullies portrayed here are much more loathsome, as they appeared more childlike is the Swedish version. Rather than show Owen's father as an alcoholic (do we need another alcoholic father in American movies?), Reeves largely removes his involvement and in a brilliant creative flourish chooses to illustrate Owen's disconnected relationship with his mother by obscuring her face whenever she's onscreen. The look of this film is a bit more monotonous, while scenes with the father (called Hkan in the original, but anonymous here) are played out with more suspense. There's an impressively shot car crash that, in context, I thought worked much better than the ""entering the bathroom in defeat"" scene from the original. In one moment where Owen simply finds a picture, Reeves adds a much deeper level to the relationship between the father and Abby.

Reeves does use a bit more CGI, but he doesn't overuse it. I think Reeves knew he couldn't make the scene where Abby meets a victim under a bridge any more poetic, so he attempted to make it, at least more, creepier. I did not approve of the decision to give Abby such a vampiric look when she feeds. The look was much more subtle and effective previously. Also, the pool scene was executed (no pun intended) much better in the original as it was simultaneously horrifying and darkly humorous. Here, it's just a dark scene (but not in the sense that it's not well-lit). Despite these changes (and despite your feelings on these changes), Reeves doesn't keep the beauty and poetry of the original intact but brings his own poetic beauty to it, really proving his merit as a capable director.

Now let's talk about the acting, beginning with Richard Jenkins. This is a highly underrated character actor who has appeared in a lot of movies (including such cinematic fecal matter as Step Brothers, among other things), but he's rarely given a role that allows him to really shine. With hardly any additional screen-time than his foreign counterpart (actor Per Ragnar), Jenkins gives a much creepier, more effective, and ultimately more sympathetic performance. He brings new life to this character that simply wasn't present before. Beyond those two performances, I will not compare any others. McPhee does a convincing, identifiable interpretation of his character and gives a performance that is more emotionally mature than you'd expect from someone who is fourteen (at the time of this writing). Moretz is a revelation in what is arguably her most mature role yet. At thirteen (as of this writing), Moretz has racked up an impressive filmography and, as Abby, she demonstrates that she's an immensely talented actress, capable of conveying emotions way beyond her years. If acting is her passion and she sticks to it, I can see her making real waves in the film industry and being the recipient of many film awards as she gets older. I don't recall seeing a performance by a child actor that impressed me this much. While many will compare her performance with Lina Leandersson's, I encourage those people to look at Moretz at face-value. This is an actress of infinite talent.

Let Me In was released to theatres in October of 2010, only four months after the third film in the Twilight Saga became a box office phenomenon. Unlike that film, Let Me In underperformed at the box office. It's a tragedy that such emotionally retarded films like Twilight do phenomenal business at the box office but something this poignant makes no impact. I mention this because fans seem to flock to human-vampire romances, yet the lesser one makes 10x the money. Let Me In is a love story, but not in any traditional, straight-forward sort of way. This adolescent love story has no kissing, no physical intimacy, and no dreary, contrived romanticizing yet is more poignant, romantic, and sweeter than Twilight while simultaneously achieving more emotional resonance than that saga could ever hope for. The fact that Moretz and McPhee, at 13 and 14, bring more pathos to their ""romance"" than the entire adult cast of Twilight says a lot about the childish idiots that populate that movie.

It's a remake, yes but it's one of the best horror films and one of the best vampire films to come out of Hollywood in a while. Let Me In is an admirable film that would be much more respected if it wasn't a remake. Few remakes live up to the original film while almost rivaling it as successfully as Let Me In does. Those not familiar with the original Swedish film should seek it out, but whether you're a big fan of the original or were completely unaware of it's existence I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this film.

I'm not going to attempt to go into detail since it's been so long, I probably wouldn't be able to do it justice anyway. There are many reviews here who explain it more than well enough.

I haven't see the original or read the book, but I was definitely blown away by this movie. It was beautiful, intriguing, and just as much disturbing. I was totally taken aback by this after I had to get up and leave the theater - I pretty much didn't know what to do with myself.

It is so raw and simple and touching, especially with the theme of good and evil, love, innocence, the basic and painful need for companionship, and the lengths someone will go to in order to support the person they care most about.

My husband is what I have come to call ""emotionally retarded (although he has gotten better over the years),"" and I am ready for him to see this movie. I am really excited to be able to own it on DVD. In fact, I don't believe I have ever really been this ready to own a movie before.

My only qualm is when the vampire action comes around it ended up being too ""animated,"" and ended up being cheesy and hokey to me. That really kind of offput me but I still give this movie 5 stars.",1296518400,4,1330,4.0456273764258555

As far as I can tell it's a movie about a shy boy making friends with a vampire and trying to co-exist.  This is one of those movies that is OK while watching it but almost instantly forgotten when it's over.  Don't go in expecting the ""Twilight"" vampires.

4319769,4,B004BLJQOK,"The past few years the vampire film has changed from what began as a horrifying creature to a seductive animal, followed by more creatures and finally with the TWILIGHT films a vampire more interested in seduction than say draining blood. All that changed with a well received Swedish film called LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.

As with most movies that have success that come from foreign markets, Hollywood made the decision to remake it as an English language film in the hopes of attracting a wider audience. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. For me, this one works and works well. And for viewers who would rather not follow subtitles this movie should do the trick.

Directed by CLOVERFIELD director Matt Reeves it's not so much a remake of the movie as it in an interpretation of the book. Reeves has gone on to say that he spoke with the author and found that his take on the book was what the author was attempting to discuss which was going through the awkward teen years set in a vampire story. It clicks here and Reeves does a great job.

Set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, we find ourselves in the midst of winter. Young Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a small boy prone to being bullied while at school. Living with his mother (a woman trapped in her own problems with a failed marriage, devout religious follower and alcoholic in training) Owen leads a lonely life. There are no other kids in their apartment complex and he spends most of his time sitting on the frozen playground outside in the snow. Until a new neighbor shows up.

Rarely seen this new neighbor moves into the apartment next door and at times Owen can hear conversations through the walls. The only person he sees is an older man (Richard Jenkins) who goes in and out of the apartment. Then one night Owen meets Abby (Chloe Moretz) who lets him know up front that they can't be friends. But friends they do become.

Owen confides in her about the bullying at school. She advises him to just take the bully on up front, that he'll back down once Owen lets himself stop being pushed around. She also lets him know that if need be she'll be there to back him up.

What Owen doesn't know is that Abby is a vampire. The man she lives with isn't really her father but the man who takes care of her, supplying her with fresh blood that he extracts from victims he kills and then drains. When a draining goes wrong, Owen can hear two voices arguing, neither of which sounds like a child. Due to this accident, Abby is forced to go out and feed on her own.

Owen and Abby become close friends. Both lead lonely lives but find comfort in one another's company. Each is the companion the other thought they'd never have. But would this be the case if Owen truly knew what Abby was?

While this story unfolds the police are searching for the savage killer on the streets. The bullies continue to give Owen a hard time as we wait to see if he calls their bluff. And the time draws near where we discover if Abby will reveal herself to Owen or not. And if she does, what will be his response?

The surface of this movie is a horror film with a few gory moments tossed in for those fans but a more horrifying tale that smolders beneath. It's less about the attacks and bloodshed of the vampire and more about what it takes to survive, especially while being 12 years old for so long. Gone is the romantic adolescent version of vampirism and in its place a deeper story of what it's like to be lonely in the middle of a world full of people.

Each actor does a fantastic job, most importantly the two young leads. For either of them to carry the weight and depth of their characters is something worth watching, for both of them to do so is amazing. Jenkins does a good job but is relegated to little in this film. And Elias Koteas as the detective searching for a killer does a tremendous job.

It seems that many horror fans have taken a liking to blood drenched horror that offers multiple mutilations these days. For those that like something to think about, that plays as much with your mind as it does your stomach, this is a movie that will whet your appetite. The pacing may be slow, but there's a reason for that. This is a story that unfolds rather than slaps you in the face. And a good story at that.",1296432000,3,4270,4.378787878787879

Forget about fairy vampires who glitter in the sunlight and move in slow motion. This movie explores the nature of the vampire in a way few movies ever have, probably since Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire. The balance between the vampiric nature of the main character and his perhaps unexplored human persona, is brilliantly maintained during the course of the movie and the result is simply astounding.

Yes, there are many people who love pretending to be snub movie critics who trash this version just for the sake of being a remake and can't wait to tell everybody they DID  watch the original Swedish version. But for those who are willing to put all bias aside and watch the movie without preconceptions, I think they will find a masterly adapted work of art here.

Let Me In is as good as the reviewers say. How could it not be though, right?!

Let Me In is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) who puts his spin on this classic vampire tale. He shows the utmost care and respect to the original source material while still being able to give us something that's totally new, Now that's talent. I eagerly await his upcoming projects as he is a director I have come to trust when it comes to giving 100% of his being into one of his movies. He gave us a masterpiece in the form of Let Me In and for that I will always be grateful.

If you had a cast that included just Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas you would have an excellent film. But that's not all Let Me In had. This movie was blessed to have two of the greatest young actors we have seen in sometime in Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road). The two are magical on screen together and they absolutely steal the show. To be so talented at such a young age is amazing to me. They prove without a shadow of a doubt that they will be forces in the movie business for a long time. I would say that we are truly lucky to live in a time where we can see them grow as actors. They are that good!

As I said earlier, this movie moved me like no other. It's very hard to explain what single emotion you feel afterward because you feel so many different things. Normally you would watch a movie and forget it within a day or two but not Let Me In. It sticks with you for some time; it's almost haunting in a way. You'll dream about it and think about it for weeks, well months in my case.

I know I didn't go into much detail about what the movie is about, but most of you know already. This review is just to let you ""Be Me A Little"" and let you know how moved I was and continue to be over this movie. It is my hope that you'll take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and experience this film. Don't just watch it, live it and breath is as well. If you feel the way I did after seeing it, and I am pretty sure you will, then you know what you have just witnessed is something special. It is not often that a movie comes along that can make you feel this way. So enjoy it and cherish it because it's a gift that is once in a lifetime. I was ""Let In"" and I am so glad that I was.

4319779,5,B004BLJQOK,"Back in 1992, I believe it was, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis was released to a blockbuster reception by the public. It was exciting, well acted and beautiful. However, it was not a trans-literation (word for word) of the source novel by James Fenimore Cooper - far from it. Like many films that have novels as their story origin, you must endeavor to take the film on its own merits and not bemoan that what you loved in the book was not on the screen as you hoped. You can love both, one, or neither, but don't hate the one for being unlike the other.

This is the problem many early critical reviewers of ""Let Me In"" seemed to fall into. They had loved the original Swedish book and film (""Let the Right One In""), but didn't like this American version because the tone and focus is slightly different. (An example would be Reeves' decision to make nearly all characters in the film outside the primaries into archetypes, not only simplifying the narrative, but also reenforcing Owen's isolation - a brilliant choice.) Many critics said things like it's ""a needless remake"" or ""not as faithful as the original"" or some such. The damaging thing is that Matt Reeves' beautiful film was not taken on its own terms and therefore was not given a chance by some of the very audience it was made for.

""Let Me In"" is beautiful, haunting, disturbing, painfully human and engrossing. The pace is deliberate, but spot-on. This was not made for the slasher film crowd. This is a movie that dares you to think what would life be like for a vampire and those around them. It works as a morality tale about, effectively, a serial killer. It also is the story about adolescence and the horrible pain of that age and the joy of finding a kindred spirit.

What is disturbing is the questions that arise from the relationships in the film. Who needs who, for what reasons, and where does the line between 'love' and 'need' end and the other begin?

The two leads in this film are stunning. No other word will suffice for their performances. They are brilliant and carry the film with their facial expressions. Moretz and Smit-McPhee deserve high praise for their work. Utterly amazing. (Compliments to the secondary players, Jenkins and Koteas, for excellent work as well.)

One final thought, a great film is enhanced by a great musical score. Like ""Mohicans"", the music in ""Let Me In"" soars and makes this film an indispensible one.

See ""Let Me In"" for all the right reasons. If you are a lover of film, this is a can't miss.",1295827200,120,2535,4.597345132743363

4319781,5,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In is truly one of the most beautifully filmed movies of 2010. The vampire story is older than movies, but John Ajvide Lindqvist's story is told from a unique perspective that is original for this genre. ""Let Me In"" is the English language version of the story. In the ""Twilight"" era this may be difficult to understand -- ""Let Me In"" brings the horror story to life while combining it with a sweet, but twisted love story. As many people have pointed out -- this vampire doesn't 'sparkle'.

The choreography is impeccable. One car crash scene has received a lot of deserved praise, but every camera shot and lighting highlights the lonely isolation of the main characters. To enhance the isolation, there are only four main actors within the movie, two of them children. These four actors are simply amazing in the way they bring this story to life.

The movie is a remake of the Swedish ""Let the Right One In"". Both are excellent movies in their own right. ""Let the Right One In"" emphasizes the innocent love story between the two children. ""Let Me In"" uses the story to highlight grand themes. For example, one theme in ""Let Me In "" is the difference between 'good' and 'evil'. We always speak of these as two abstract opposites, but in this movie 'good' and 'evil' coexist in the gray area in between. The two movies complement each other well. Some people have loved the Swedish movie so much that they have difficulty enjoying another version. That's unfortunate -- this version is just as good and very different.",1295740800,13,1527,4.651851851851852
4319782,5,B004BLJQOK,"It was with some amount of trepidation that I first heard about the impending release of Let Me In. Like many others, I was quite taken by the original Swedish film, Let the Right One In, which easily secured a spot on my Top 10 of that year. I feared that a remake would only excise the poetic nature of the story in favor of a by-the-numbers vampire film. The attachment of Matt Reeves as writer and director didn't do much to assuage my fears. Cloverfield was entertaining enough for what it was, but its gimmicky shaky-cam aesthetic wasn't very indicative of his directorial abilities. Once the good reviews of the film started pouring in, I figured I'd see it just to say that I did and then forget about its existence shortly thereafter.

Could I possibly have been more wrong? I ultimately saw the film five times during its brief theatrical run. It's been three months since then, and I still can't stop thinking about it. Never before has my reaction to a film been so contrary to my preconceived notions. Not only do I prefer the remake, it has fast become one of my all-time favorite films, and Matt Reeves has shot to the top of my ""directors to watch"" list. While there is much that can be said for how Let Me In compares to its Swedish counterpart, I'm going to try and keep comparisons to a minimum, because Let Me In stands firmly on its own two feet as a film. The wonderful thing is that one film doesn't have to supplant the other; Let the Right One In is a beautiful film in its own right, and Let Me In is another faithful and unique cinematic take on the same story.

The story in question originally comes from the mind of Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist, who wrote the original film as well as the novel that inspired it. The plot revolves around a lonely 12-year-old boy who is bullied mercilessly at school and finds solace in his budding relationship with the girl who lives next door. Unbeknownst to him, the girl also happens to be a blood-thirsty vampire who has been 12-years-old for a very long time. Reeves' adaptation of the material is respectful, thoughtful, and personal. In rendering his version of the story, he draws on the overall structure of the original film, various details from the original novel, as well as some of his own ideas and experiences growing up. Reeves clearly has a firm grasp on the complexities of the material, and he crafts Let Me In as a poignant coming-of-age story, tender love story, and chilling horror story all at once. By thoughtfully transplanting the proceedings to 1980s Regan America, Reeves uses the sociopolitical context of that era as a backdrop for Owen's tortured adolescence, resulting in a subtle exploration of moral ambiguity and duality. Despite its fantastical elements, at its core, Let Me In tackles fundamental human needs - the need to connect, the need to survive, and the need to make sense of a sometimes cold and frightening world. Whereas most modern horror films rely on excessive gore as a substitute for intelligence, Let Me In is one of the select few that brilliantly utilizes its horror premise as a multi-layered metaphor to explore a variety of thought-provoking ideas.

While Reeves' screenplay adaptation is impressive in its own right, his directorial style is just as powerful and artistic. Simply put, Let Me In is one of the most elegantly directed horror films I've had the pleasure of watching in a really long time. Reeves' controlled and careful direction is a revelation in today's frenetic cinematic world. Let Me In is one of those rare films where virtually every shot helps reveal character and drive the narrative forward. Reeves is clearly an ardent admirer of Alfred Hitchcock, and his point-of-view driven visual storytelling does an admirable job of cementing the audience in the perspective of the central characters. Furthermore, he injects his film with a sense of dread and tension that would have made the Master of Suspense proud.  Between Reeves' crafted cinematic approach and his cinematographer's haunting gothic visual palette, Let Me In is a breathtaking and beautiful film to behold.

Finally, a discussion of Let Me In's strong suits isn't complete without addressing the power of its two lead performances. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz may have only been 12-years-old at the time of filming, but their performances exude a sense of depth and maturity far beyond their years. Let Me In may revolve around two children, but it is a dark and complex film for adults, and the fact that McPhee and Moretz are able to shoulder the weight of the film with such a sense of grace speaks volumes for their talent as actors. Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas turn in excellent supporting performances, but the central story of Let Me In lives or dies by the success of its two leads, and McPhee and Moretz play a huge part in making Let Me In the emotionally charged film that it is.

Although it didn't do nearly as well as it should have at the box office, Let Me In deserves to find a larger audience on DVD and Blu-ray. It's a rare and precious gem that got unfairly swept aside in the chaotic rush of awards season, despite its strong critical reception. In a cinematic climate where countless films are created solely to cash in and make money, it comes as a startling surprise that such a moving, layered, and crafted piece of cinema would come in the form of a remake. And yet, Let Me In is all of these things and more. Anyone who likes their films to have equal doses of artistry, emotion, and intelligence owes it to themselves to pick up a copy of Let Me In. Don't let the genre deter you; it's not just an amazing horror film, it's not just an amazing remake, it's an amazing film, period.",1295740800,83,5747,4.673913043478261

The original Swedish film is so beautiful in it's cinematography, it's simple cats with short dialogues and the quiet harsh Swedish winter as a main character, that the idea of remaking it sounded wrong. And wrong it was! There's nothing that the American version does to improve the original, it's just a bad remake for people who don;t feel like reading subtitles. All the mystery feeling is gone. The casting is not as good as in the original, the Swedish kids are amazing and the girl's eyes are such an important element that's lost in the remake.

After seeing so many horrible/poorly acted movies, I thought this was going to be another one when the first ten or so minutes began...slowly. Then, it began to pick up and kept me engrossed.

4319786,5,B004BLJQOK,"Horror fans around the world cried foul when the phenomenal Swedish vampire tale LET THE RIGHT ONE IN was scheduled for an American remake within one year of its DVD release. Thankfully, writer/director Matt Reeves manages to pull together an equally beautiful film that retains the heart and soul of the original in its overall mood and aesthetic. LET ME IN follows Owen, a shy boy who is constantly tormented by his peers. When a strange young girl moves in next door, the two bond out of their shared loneliness to form a close friendship. What Owen doesn't know is that his new playmate is an ageless vampire, and that she is sustaining herself on the blood of their neighbors. Reeves uses the same drained color palette and restrained shooting style that can be found in Alfredson's film, filling each scene with cold blues and muted browns in order to give LET ME IN a bleak but timeless look and feel. Its story and characters share the same level of warmth and depth from before, brought over from the portion of John Ajvide Lindqvist's original screenplay that was left intact. This would have meant nothing without the stellar leads played by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz, who bring the characters to life with a pair of incredible performances from such young actors. With few exceptions, LET ME IN also remains as subtle and effective as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, however there are a few moments that have been cheapened through the unnecessary use of computerization. These minor trespasses are easier to overlook when Reeves has gone to such great lengths to honor and respect the film's source material. In the end, LET ME IN proves to be one of the most confident and skillful remakes to come out in recent years, yet it still begs the question ""Why?"" when so little has been changed. Still, it more than serves its purpose in retelling the same exact story for lazy American audiences that can't be bothered with subtitles.

4319787,5,B004BLJQOK,"I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but this one really had me.  It's the most engrossing horror film I've seen in years.

 Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a lonely kid, mercilessly bullied at school, whose parents are divorcing.  One winter night, he meets Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), a girl who has just moved into the apartment complex and never wears shoes.

 Abby is a vampire, trapped in a child's body, and her ""father"" (Richard Jenkins) is actually her protector.  Not only does he go out and kill people so that Abby can have blood, but when she does the dastardly deed herself, he disposes of the body.

 Both friendless, Owen and Abby bond and it is a relationship that endures even after the young man learns the truth about the strange girl.

 Adapted by director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD) from a Swedish novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, LET ME IN is both a horror film and a heart-wrenching tale about the pain of adolescence.  Abby may kill people in order to survive, but she is also a victim.  She didn't ask to become a vampire.

 The picture is dark and violent, though much of the blood-letting (wisely) happens off-screen.  It is also a love story that will haunt you long after the movie ends.

4319788,5,B004BLJQOK,"The failure of Let Me In at the box office just goes to show how this generation will waste money on silly Twilight movies and not see true vampire classics.  The story is one of romance, but a dark romance at that.  Gone are all the pretty immortals and the annoying defenseless human of Twilight, (btw I read all the books and saw the movies).  Back are the actual vampire rules (no daylight, no coming in uninvited, and only human blood). :-)

This movie doesn't have love at first sight either.  The story follows a young boy, Owen, who has been picked on, ignored, and become an emotional hermit. He feels truly alone in the world. When he first meets Abby, the vampire girl, there is no moment of love, only cold emotions. But as the pair continues to slowly interact, Owen realizes that Abby is as lonesome as he is and the fact that the only friends they have is each other makes them each stronger.  This friendship/childhood love makes the movie perfect. In the dark, gritty setting of the movie, there is not lust, but a pure childhood love.

All the while, Abby's ""father"" shows his affection for her by stalking and killing townspeople and draining their blood.  These acts lead to one of the most suspenseful scenes I have ever seen in a movie.  His character is one whom, even though you and I don't like murderer's, you sympathize with because of his love of Abby.

All in all, this movie took me by surprise.  Once the characters were introduced and the bone chilling suspense started, my heart was pounding during the last hour of the movie.  I'm an action/horror junkie by nature and this film has the best of both worlds.  I loved this movie and so will anyone who is okay with a little gore in their movies (this movie isn't the next SAW) .

4319789,4,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In (Matt Reeves, 2010)

While Let Me In didn't garner anywhere near the critical or popular success I thought it would when it came out late last year, the months between its release and the end of 2010 seem to have allowed it to simmer beneath a lot of surfaces, and over the past few weeks I've started hearing Oscar buzz about it, along with the refrain ""better than the original."" I certainly wouldn't go that far--the original, Let the Right One In, was hands-down the best film of 2008, whereas Let Me In has a great deal of competition for that spot. And yet there is a great deal to like here, and while I did find myself picking it apart in a number of places, I can't deny it's one of the best horror films to come out of the Hollywood machine in the past decade, a feat which is even more impressive given how horribly Hollywood tends to treat its remakes.

Plot, in case you missed the original (go see it now, I'll wait) and didn't read the book (which you should also do at your earliest convenience): Owen (The Road's Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a bullied twelve-year-old with delusions of grandeur, parents going through a divorce, and very little hope of anything interesting happening in his life. Until, that is, Abby ((500) Days of Summer's Chloe Moretz) moves in next door with her odd guardian (The Visitor's Richard Jenkins). The two of them begin a hesitant relationship, though Abby warns Owen away repeatedly; still, she seems desperate for human contact, and Owen's passivity draws her; she offers him advice on how to deal with the school's idiot bullies. Meanwhile, a serial killer gears up in the area. You don't have to be a genius to know what's coming, especially since everyone and their mothers has already spoiled it for you, including the film's tagline: Abby is a vampire, and everyone knows it except Owen.

High point: Reeves (Cloverfield), working with John Ajvide Lindqvist on this adaptation, stuck a lot closer to the book than did Let the Right One In (which, interestingly, Lindqvist also wrote the adaptation for); within the first five minutes, you understand Owen is a pretty deeply disturbed individual, whereas in the original film he's pretty much the quintessential nice guy who's guaranteed to finish last. Low point: there's still a lot of deviation from the source material, and some of it comes off quite odd. It's obvious they were planning on including a lot more of the book, but veered off at the last minute. (Why is Owen's father even in this movie? And while it's obvious on one level what Abby means when she says ""I'm not a girl"", there's a scene about two-thirds of the way through the film with a photograph that tells me that Reeves and Lindqvist were salivating to include the book's huge, huge plot twist in that regard... which then disappears, never to be seen again.)

High point: Smit-McPhee and Moretz are very good actors, probably as good as Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leanderson (Oskar and Eli in the original). Low point: everyone else in the movie either comes off as cardboard (Cara Buono, playing Owen's mother, is a prime example, or the bullies) or doesn't get nearly enough screen time to really let their talents come forth (Jenkins, or Elias Koteas as the investigating officer).

High point: whereas the original film focused almost solely on the romance angle (it would be really, really tough to even call Let the Right One In a horror film were it not for the ""what happens if I don't invite you in?"" scene... oh, more on that next paragraph), Let Me In definitely wants to play in horror movie territory, and it does it passably well--though this is a horror film in the vein of such recent faves of mine as Shallow Ground and Deadbirds, where if you come expecting ultragore, you're bound to be disappointed. Low point: a lot of what's missing from the book is the themes and scenes that really drive the horror angle home. Most notably absent is Abby's/Eli's sociopathy; it's never less than obvious in the book that all she really needs Owen/Oskar for is as a replacement handler. She wants to break through that wall inside her that keeps her from having friends (and lovers, one assumes; the pedophilia aspect of the book is touched on here, but only barely, in one brief scene, and you probably wouldn't even notice it had you not read the book), but she's incapable of doing so. Here, Abby seems... well, a more normal, well-adjusted kid than Owen, which is odd when you consider the fact that Abby is a couple of centuries older than you are. Also missing are the neighbor who owns the basement room (and whose mother, in the novel, is having a burgeoning relationship with the Elias Koteas character), the barflies who provide a major subplot (though the main pair are kind of remade here as a yuppie couple), and, as noted above, Owen's dad, who is mentioned once briefly, then appears in a phone conversation, and... that's it. And I'm just scratching the surface.

High point: what gore there is in this movie is really nicely done. (The goriest scene in the film is, ironically, also its funniest; Richard Jenkins knows comic timing.) Low point: if you're going to blow one of the gore scenes, the one to blow is not the iconic ""what happens if I don't invite you in?"" scene. Oh, god, what a letdown. If you have seen this, see the original if only for that scene, if you haven't, to show how effective a minimal special effects budget can still be.

So yeah, not as good as the original film, which was as good as (though a different beast than) the novel on which both are based. But still, in most cases the good outweighs the bad here, and if you compare it to the other horror movies that came out in 2010--at least those I've seen--it stands head and shoulders above the crowd. Worth your time. *** ",1294963200,4,5808,4.626576139670223
4319790,5,B004BLJQOK,"First of all, let me get one thing out of the way: As a huge admirer and fan of the original ""Let the Right One In,"" Matt Reeves's ""Let Me In"" delivers a wonderfully told and executed story supported by an exceptionally talented cast.  ""Let Me In"" is absolutely one of the best remakes I've seen to date and is on an entirely new level when compared to modern horror flicks.

If you loved the original, I guarantee that you will fall in love with this movie or at least come to admire the large amount of quality work that has gone into making this film in terms of directing sequences or the cast's believable performances, which are just as great as those of the original.

The story here follows the same path as Tomas Alfredson's original, which was based on a novel by author John Ajvide Lindqvist.  The author has publicly stated he is pleased with the new retelling of his novel.
The author states:

""I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. Let The Right One In is a great Swedish movie. Let Me In is a great American movie. There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present. But Let Me In puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. Let Me In is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful. Again.""

--Pretty awesome review there by the author himself, eh?!

Anyways, let's get back to MY review of the movie.  What else can I say?  The story here is once again true, real, believable (despite built of vampire lore), gritty, heart-breaking, sad, uplifting, emotional, thought-provoking, etc....Oh, I could go on and on about how great this movie is.  The story, characters, setting, and script are all brought alive by a truly wonderfully excellent cast, all equally talented and exceptional in conveying the emotional grief and feelings felt by the characters.  Thought Richard Jenkins may not say much, his face reveals all there is to know about his character, which is no easy task.

The ending, once again, is thought-provoking and open-ended.  It hasn't changed much, but I suppose it's Matt Reeves's way of showing his unwavering respect for the original film.  Really, I fail to have any idea as to how any other ending could have surpassed the original ending.  Both endings carry so much weight and meaning to them as the ending itself has carried this and the original film to new heights in the horror/vampire lore genre.

Now, I hope that the DVD version of ""Let Me In"" contains the same amount of features and extras as the blu-ray version.  I'm really starting to grow tired of all of these blu-ray exclusive extras and digital copies found only in blu-ray.  The majority of the population out there still have DVD players and will continue to purchase DVDs for a very long time and I just wish studios out there recognize that fact and support the DVD just as much as they support the blu-ray versions.

Here's my final verdict:

Consider this:  You're a fan of the novel, you're a fan of the original movie, you love vampire movies, you love horror movies, you love movies that carry a deep meaning and weight, you love movies with an exceptional cast, you love movies and you want to have a great time watching one.

If any of those categories above fit you, you NEED to see ""Let Me In.""

4319796,4,B004BLJQOK,"I recently wrote a review on this very site for the original Swedish version; ""Let the Right One in"" or ""Lat Den Ratte Komma In"", I also mention in the review that I initially saw the American version; ""Let Me In"" first, so it's only fitting that I do a review of this adaptation as well.
  Both films are masterfully done by their respective directors and cinematographers, both films have a well written script and a fine talented cast. Main difference in my opinion and this is where I favor the original over the American version is that ""Let the Right One In"" was scripted by the original author John Ajvide Lindqvist so it more closely follows the novel. The child actors in this version as with the original turn in great inspiring performances considering the source material; Kodi Smit Phee(the Road) and especially Chloe Grace Moretz(Kick Ass)turn in very effective and emotionally packed portrayals of the main characters Owen/Oskar and Abby/Eli.
  If you're looking for the traditional Vampire tale then you will be dissapointed, no senseless gore or violence, no hapless dimwitted victims running about...just good intelligent storytelling and fine acting. Some folks have compared this to a younger version of ""Twilight"" which in my opinion insults this film as it does the original version-this is far better, both in story and performance. The film has of course been ""Americanized"", instead of taking place in Stockholm in the early 1980s it takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico at the same time period. Director Matt Reeves(Cloverfield) captures the era accurately with some very minor goofs and captures the mood admirably, the only thing is he folowed the original film ""too"" closely at times, you'd almost swear it was done ""shot for shot"" in certain scenes. But where I damn him for that I must also commend him on the adaptation in general, he switched out a few scenarios and changed some supporting characters which help make this version all the more enjoyable. Veteran character actor Richard Jenkins turns in a fine performance as the care giver to Abby despite the fact that he has so few lines-same goes for actor Elias Koteas who plays the investigating detective(a character not in the original-this part was originally a nosy neighbor in the Swedish film and novelization).The character of Abby has been more softened in this adaptation, more caring or manipulative if you prefer than as is translated from the original Eli in ""Let The Right One In"".
  Owens parents are practically non-existent in this version which also is a key difference from the original so you do not feel too badly with Owen's decision to leave with Abby at the end. I prefer the original film but I do like how they adapted this version...The main reason to check this version out is of course the story and for its fine performances, especially the kids Kodi Smitt Phee and Chloe Grace Moretz.

4319797,5,B004BLJQOK,"This is the best horror film I have seen since ""The Shining.""  The relationship between Owen and Abby was beautiful and complex, and was masterfully done by the two young actors.  So masterful for their age I was immersed  immediately!  The story was superb and their chemistry was perfection.  The acting  by Richard Jenkins and  Elias Koteas was spot on and authentic, as could be expected and cannot be overlooked.

 The cinematography and musical soundtrack were a perfect combination to create atmosphere and feeling.  The orchestral  music furthered the intensity and seriousness of  Abby's need to feed, and protect,  but the classic rock tunes from the era echoed the universal teenage experience of social  rebellion and  awkward sexual curiosity.  I was  personally  further drawn in because of being bullied at that same age, with no real friends to rely on.  The solitude and emotional pain are immense.  I could only dream then of having an mature minded  and loyal friend like Abby to help me through that tough time..

 The strength that Abby provides, and ultimately uses to rid this problem for Owen is enormous and addictive. (much like this film!)  Thus it is easy to see why he would leave with her immediately at the end and forgo the average life.  I am addicted to this beautiful work.  Very few things inspire or move me anymore.  But this film captures a powerful moment in the human condition even with it's fictional elements.  Though a realist,  I am currently  in fantasia.  Though cynical,  I am currently inspired by greatness.

I must say that the endless remarks about this film not coming up to the quality of the Swedish version are enough to make me grab a barf bag: the author of the novel upon which both films are based considers himself incredibly lucky to have two ""excellent"" interpretations of his one story in these two films: you'd think sometimes that in some peoples' minds the Swedish film came before the Swedish novel.

4319800,5,B004BLJQOK,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie, but some of the strongest reasons for watching the movie have not been fully extolled, so please read this review.  It may be of help to you.

The other people who earlier wrote reviews of Let Me In have more than sufficiently explained the story of the movie, as well as eloquently explained its excellences, so I won't bother repeating what has already been so well provided (and I don't consider any of the following to be true spoilers, as most of the movie is fairly predictible, and that is not a fault in this case).  However, if you are one of the readers who have read those reviews and despite learning of the brilliances of the casting, the cast in general (Kodi is GREAT), the cinematography and the superlative direction, and yet you still did not see the movie (which has left the theaters at the time of this writing), then there are yet other reasons to consider getting the DVD/Blu-Ray, and they are among the most powerful.  The vampire herself, and the actress who plays her, and how they create such incredibly contrasting and opposing emotions in the viewer.  THIS is really what makes this film so fresh, and why it MUST be viewed...repeatedly.

As you may have already absorbed, Abby is a petite, 12 year old vampire girl.  Of course (as Abby herself explains), she has been 12 for a very---long---time.  The thing is....not only is she physically stuck at 12, but she is also mentally and emotionally stuck at 12.  So despite how long she has inhabited the Earth, and despite all the experiences she has lived through, she still has the attitudes, likes, and responses of a 12 year old girl.  And this makes her different from any vampire that has preceded her (and arguably more interesting).  This difference begins in the music that introduces her (kudos to Michael Giacchino).  Whenever the magnificent Christopher Lee has played Dracula (a truly foul, soulless monster who honestly enjoys his killing), Dracula's presence is accompanied by extremely ominous and evil music.  There's no doubt what kind of ""person"" he is.  But the first time that a viewer sees Abby, she is accompanied by the blissfully pure sound of boy sopranos......it is the kind of gorgeous sound that we normally associate with angels, and Our Father in Heaven.  And yet, THIS is the kind of music that accompanies....the vampire.  Right away, something is different.  Right away, the entire rest of the movie has been cannily set up.  And the viewer wonders, ""How can such a creature be accompanied by music that is so............sweet?"".  They don't know the half of it, but ""sweet"" IS the right word.

Abby has no wish to take someone else's life.  But as she also simply explains, ""I need blood.......to live"".  Like all living creatures, she wants to survive, she doesn't want to die.  Unfortunately (and according to the book), she can't follow the lead of the Cullens, or Stefan Salvatore.  She MUST have blood that has just come out of a living human being.  If the blood comes from any other source (no bunnies for her) or is not fresh (no hospital blood for her), it will not nourish her, it will actually be harmful to her.  Therefore, innocent people must be brutally murdered in order for her to continue living.  Either Abby herself must attack such innocent people (and her attacks are VIOLENT in both sight and sound)......or someone must do the killing for her.

A man (somewhat middle-aged......sorry, Mr. Jenkins) lives with Abby.  For years (and once every few days), he goes out into the night and attacks a person and drains their blood while they are unconscious but still alive.  He then takes the blood to Abby for her to consume....and this has been going on for a long time.  After a movie viewer sees such an attack, they can't help but wonder, ""How can he do something so horrible, so cruel, so deliberate and of his own volition.....for a vampire?"".  No, he is not compelled....at least, not the way the Salvatores do it.  But in a way, he feels compelled to perform these ghastly acts nonetheless.  This will be explained.

When Abby attacks and drinks blood, not only is it violent, but she actually looks.....well.......""like a vampire"".  But at almost all other times, she is the most...........adorable, loveliest, sweetest (and yes, she deserves the boy soprano music) 12 year old girl you could ever imagine.  Well, not at first because: 1) someone in her ""occupation"" needs to be wary, and 2) most people are grouchy when they are hungry, and Abby suffers hunger very painfully.  Other than these exceptions, she is indeed absolutely angelic.  If you don't have a daughter, she will make you wish you had one, even if you never have before.  She is SO adorable that you can't help but fall in love with the young lady.  Even though you know what she is.  Even though you know what she does.  Even though you've seen her brutally murder innocent people right in front you.  You will still come to care for her.  There is a scene (later in the film) where a bit of sunlight strikes her leg, and she naturally starts to fry immediately.  I heard people in the theater GASP!  They were worried for her, they were concerned for her, they wanted to protect her, they had come to care for her.  Even though they knew what she is.  Even though they knew what she does.  Even though they had seen her brutally murder innocent people right in front of them.  They couldn't help caring for her because even though she performs the acts of an inhuman monster, Abby is THAT adorable.  And what makes her that adorable....is the performance of the wonderful and magical Chloe Grace Moretz.  Yes, I imagine the insightful direction of Matt Reeves had a lot to do with that, but it is still the angelic (yes, that's the word) face, personality and performance of Chloe Grace that makes viewers fall in love with a creature that performs utterly reprehensible and terrible acts.  The viewers just can't help themselves (and this reaction is magnified upon repeated viewings).  And once this happens, only THEN can it be understood how a man could spend his life with her.....killing innocent people.  He had fallen irrevocably in love with her when he was young.  And by the end of the movie, it seems likely that there have been others that have done so in the past...and there will be others afterward.  Yes, I imagine it still seems impossible to you, the reader.  After all, Abby's last visible act of the movie is tremendously horrible.  And yet, it is also ultimately and characteristically good-hearted.....at the same time.  Once you have experienced the utter magic that Chloe Grace puts into Abby, you may understand.  Either Chloe Grace is a truly wonderful young lady, or she is a mind-bogglingly talented actress.  Her other movies and her vlogs and interviews suggest.....it's a little of both.

It is regrettable that the natural end of life is death.  And it is regrettable that the wonderful actors and actresses with whom we've grown up and with whom we've spent our lives are passing away, one by one.  Each time this happens (especially to the truly greatest ones), it leaves a gaping hole in our hearts because we've lost an old friend and a great entertainer, but it also makes us wonder if such a loss will detrimentally affect the acting industry.  Well, after seeing Let Me In numerous times, I no longer have any worries.  The performance of Chloe Grace makes it abundantly and wonderfully clear that the future of the acting industry is as bright as a supernova.  Indeed, it is as bright.....as this young supernova.

SO.......when they come out, it is suggested that you buy the DVD or Blu-Ray, and play it on the best audio/video system you can find.  Be prepared to fall in love with a vampire AND the magical actress who has cinematically given both Abby and herself............immortality.",1290297600,9,7882,4.756816507000737
4319801,5,B004BLJQOK,"What an exceptional film. This is a movie experience that lingers with you long after the credits roll. A beautifully shot cinematic experience. This remake of the Swedish ""Let The Right One In"" is on par with the original, which was an amazing film itself. This is the story of a bullied boy, with no friends and his daily routine into the horrors of school bullying. Who befriends a mysterious new neighbor that just moved in. Through their interactions, you see a blossoming youthful love story, while strangely horrific in a sense. Let Me In is a must see.

Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) did a wonderful job of taking the good elements from the original movie and keeping them similar, while also removing some elements that were ""filler"" or things that took away from the main focus of the movie. Kudos to Mr. Reeves and taking on this daunting project, and proving to skeptics that this is one of the great remakes in recent history along with The Departed.

The actors Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby) give Oscar worthy performances. They draw the audience in, and make you feel an incredible sense of sympathy for both Owen and Abby. Chloe Grace Moretz seems to be the ""IT"" girl right now, and although this movie wasn't a box office hit, the movie and her performance has been raved about. A stark difference to her character Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl from the movie ""Kick-Ass"". She has a bright future ahead of her, no doubt.

I recommend renting this movie, and if you love it (which is the case with most of the people I know), then definitely purchase this dvd/Blu-ray. I just hope the Special Features are loaded.",1290211200,6,1651,4.7456445993031355
4319802,4,B004BLJQOK,"The last thing I wanted to see was a vampire movie with kids; I was a huge vampire fan in the '70's but I'm 50 now and after ""Buffy"" I realized there was nowhere to go with monster/horror except space, the final frontier. Of all the movies playing at our 13-plex one got a good review- ""Let Me In"". I wasn't aware of any other version, as I stopped following film business in the '90's, and found myself very satisfied with the relationship of a bullied 12 or 13 year old boy and a girl in the snow with no shoes or jacket. (In fact I can't recall ever seeing barefoot vampire girls in the snow. Lugosi's girls may have been barefoot, but they were always in the cellar of the castle wandering around the coffins.) The relationship between the girl and her caretaker ( way to go, Mr. Jenkins!) was interesting and I'm sure started out similar to the two teen leads. We seldom go to films but this was one very satisfying especially since the story of a teen vamp and company can be appealing to my demographic. Did I want to BE a vampire when I was 13? Was I ever bullied or intimidated? Do we all make certain ""sacrifices"" for our ""master""? You figure out the ending before the end then come back to reality; you've made it to 50 and are glad you are NOT a vampire/caretaker!",1289952000,6,1276,4.276859504132231
4319803,4,B004BLJQOK,"When I first heard that there was going to be an American remake of ""Let The Right One In"" I was skeptical. There had only been maybe a year or two since the original came out and Hollywood often ruins many of the remakes of foreign films they do (most of the asian horror ones except for maybe ""The Ring""). What at first looked like a cheap attempt to cash-in from the success of the original actually turns out to be a good and faithful adaption of the Swedish film and the novel of the same name. The lead actors Kodi Smit-McPhee(The Road)and Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass) both give good well-acted performances as the characters of the boy Owen and the vampire girl Abby. The film is essentially the same storyline as the original and comes close to a shot by shot remake however making it work (Unlike the remake of ""Psycho""). This film offers superb cinematography as well as a well thought out script and music score. The only real weakness Let Me In has is the use of cgi during scenes where Abby is attacking her victims. These scenes come across as fake and laughable and were done better in the original film. Overall this is a faithful remake that lives up to the original and is one of the best theatrical horror films to come out this year.",1289865600,5,1247,4.449781659388647
4319804,5,B004BLJQOK,"I would have to agree with a lot of the other viewers. I went to see this not knowing anything about this film, or the original for that matter, and was completely riveted to my seat. I couldn't believe how well these two young actors were able to translate emotion through very little action, whether it was Chloe Moretz's  very slight facial expressions (like when she says ""I'm a lot stronger than you think."" to Owen, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee), or the all too familiar (for me, anyway) bullying that poor Owen had to go through daily. I've seen many vampire and monster films in general, but I don't think I've ever felt sorry for the vampire. The pain and sadness emanating from both characters resonates pretty strongly throughout as you begin to learn a little more about them. The lack of a large cast, and more so, aside from Abby's ""guardian"", there is a distinct feeling that these two are completely alienated by those closest to them.
I'd be surprised if there wasn't at least a couple nominations for awards from this film. There are some very sincere and soft elements to this film, but it is also quite disturbing at the same time. This is an amazing film, and I'd suggest any fan of the monster-movie genre to see this, just try not to let the negative reviews from some critics preform an opinion for you. I went back to the theater a couple more times, thankfully, as it was only up for a few weeks around my area.",1288915200,9,1435,4.498084291187739
4319805,5,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In is a movie with heart.  You care for and about the characters.  That doesn't sound unusual for a film, but this is a pre-teen vampire movie (rated R).  You would assume that this movie would have characters out of comic books.  Not so.  The main characters played exceptionally by Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee will tug at your heart strings even though they are far from flawless 12 year olds.  But they were both drew bad hands and they are trying to deal with their situations the best they can. What would you do?",1288483200,8,531,4.422680412371134
4319806,5,B004BLJQOK,"Comparisons to the Swedish version of this film, ""Let the Right One In"", are inevitable; as much as we try to avoid them, it's next to impossible.  That being said, my rating of 5 stars is not, in any way, a reflection of how well the American remake (this IS a remake, afterall) tracks to the original.  Rather, it's based on how it stands on its own.

By now, you get the picture.  Owen, a disenfranchised youth in a somewhat hopeless existence is picked on mercilessly by local bullies.  Abby, a girl who only comes out at night and walks in the snow with bare feet, moves in next door with what appears to be her father.  People start dying while Owen, a 12 year old boy, develops a crush on his new neighbor.  Abby's ""father"" warns her to stay away, but she gives in to her new friend, seemingly longing for attention, for companionship.  With Abby's encouragement, Owen learns to fight back and stand on his own 2 feet.

The cinematography of this film is a refreshing departure from the somewhat ADHD-ish American films of late; fast moving, mockumentary camera work is seemingly the norm these days.  I don't necessarily mind it if the film warrants that method (The Hurt Locker), but it has become pass&eacute; and overdone.  ""Let Me In"" is refreshing in that the camera languishes on characters and lets you really ""see"" them, rather than ripping away too fast or bouncing around.  You get enough time to take it all in and process what you're seeing.  This type of camera work was also necessary to accurately track with the pacing of the film.

Everyday life is not a sequence of car crashes, explosions, and super human fight scenes, especially when you're talking about the everyday lives of those who have given up hope.  The apartment complex Owen and his mother live in is such a place - a prison-like dwelling of people who have given in to hopelessness, to a meaningless existence.  The best way to portray this is exactly what this film does: to pace it slowly, as if it's simply plodding along without joy and hope.  Using that method sets the mood for the audience and punctuates the scenes of absolute horror even more.  The everyday dullness and drudgery of the character's lives was depicted masterfully by this pacing.  The only complaint I have (and this is where a comparison of the is inevitable) is that the Swedish version did a slightly better job of it.

One of the most refreshing discoveries of this film was how closely it tracks to our understanding of vampires: they need blood, they can't eat regular food, they can't enter a dwelling without being invited, they explode into flames in sunlight, and they are incredibly strong.  There's neither twinkling in the sun nor surprise appearances in the human love interest's bedroom.  In fact, when Abby walks into Owen's apartment uninvited, the result is incredibly powerful.

** SPOILER ALERT! **

In the original Swedish version, Eli is shown changing after a shower to wash off the blood caused by entering Oskar's apartment uninvited.  Eli is shot naked from the back before she puts on a dress.  In the American remake, Abby walks into a room and Owen ""spies"" on her through the open door.  His reaction is enough to indicate a young boy's pubescent interest in the other sex.  Some have complained that Americans are prudes and this change undermines the remake, but I believe that criticism to be misguided and a bit sophomoric.  The director understands a naked 12 year old girl is taboo camera material to an American audience, reeking a little of child porn.  The Swedish sensibilities are very different, it seems.  Director Matt Reeves deftly gets the point across without alienating the audience.

** END OF SPOILER ALERT! **

The reason why this movie will appeal to the more intelligent film viewer is this: it doesn't insult us.  There's plenty of gore, mind you, but there's also plenty that's portrayed off camera or in the shadows, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.  You're left to fill in the blanks and not be spoon fed by the director's vision of what he thinks it should look like.  As an example, a sequence shot to perfection is the pool scene; there's an enormous amount of gore, but it's portrayed via Owen's underwater viewpoint.  We clearly get the picture, but the visual is left for the viewer to fill in, a refreshing change.  A long, languishing, distant pull back of the scene is perfect to help anchor our understanding of what just happened.

This film stands on its own as one of my top 5 films and one of the best films of the year.  While I tried hard not to compare it to the original, I will say that the Swedish version was marginally better, but not by much.  The bleak portrayal of the apartment complex in the original edged out this remake ever so slightly.  You really need to see both.  They are that good.",1288396800,7,4848,4.660777385159011
4319807,4,B004BLJQOK,"""Let Me In"" is every bit as unnerving, absorbing, tragic, touching, and compelling as ""Let the Right One In,"" the 2008 Swedish horror film on which it's based. This is remarkable given all the ways it could have gone wrong, which is really an underhanded way of saying all the ways it could have been Americanized. The original film, and the novel on which it was based, was a vampire story in the strictest sense, but is wasn't a two-hour ordeal of tired vampire clich&eacute;s like crucifixes and garlic; rather, it was a reserved, disturbing peek into the lives of two lonely kids, one of whom just happens to be a vampire. The remake, despite the conversion from Swedish to English, gives us the exact same peek, which was a wise move on writer/director Matt Reeves' part since it allows the audience to connect to the story on a more emotional level.

Indeed, the story is one of deep, primal emotions - isolation, neglect, fear, uncertainty, and, in its own disturbing way, love. This isn't to suggest that the film romanticizes the leads. That would not only be inappropriate given their ages, it would also ruin the suspense the story builds, for it's a convention used in far too many vampire movies. When I say love, I'm referring to the deep seeded need these kids share for some kind of attachment, some sense that someone out there actually cares for them. Despite vast differences in age and category of species, the two are very much alike. The boy, twelve-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), has no friends, is mercilessly bullied in school, and lives in a broken him, his parents divorced and his father no longer in the picture. The vampire, Abby (Chlo Grace Moretz), who has been twelve for a very long time, is forced to move from place to place and cannot get close with anyone. Her only companion is an older man (Richard Jenkins) who roams the city streets in search of unwilling blood donors.

The film, which takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico during the winter of 1983, shows Owen and Abby finding solace in each other's company. Owen doesn't initially know what Abby is. Why does she smell funny? Why does she walk barefoot through the snow? Why is she only seen at night? Why does she have to be invited into someone's home? And what could she possibly means by asking him, ""Would you like me even if I wasn't a girl?"" When he finally learns the truth, he hardly seems bothered or even surprised by it; perhaps his unfortunate family and academic circumstances have permanently numbed him. When Abby learns of the abuse he endures at school, she encourages him to hit back, and if the bullies persist, then he must simply hit harder. Indeed, the bullies are just this side of sadistic, subjecting him to the kind of psychical and psychological torment exhibited by sociopaths. When Owen whacks one of the boys across the head with a stick during a field trip, severely gashing his ear, it's only natural that we should feel immensely satisfied.

One of the more interesting symbolic approaches to Owen's emotional neglect was keeping his mother's face hidden throughout the entire film. Whenever she's in a scene, the camera is angled so that only her body is revealed; if we do see her head, it's either hidden in shadow, shot at a distance, obstructed by an object, or filmed from the back. Even her driver's license photo is obscured by an official seal stamped into the plastic. Perhaps the divorce was too much for her to handle. Or perhaps she's too devoutly religious. In any case, if there is any love between mother and son, it has clearly been stripped to the barest of expressions. We're not meant to see this woman as a mother. We're barely meant to see her as a person.

I suppose I should address the film's violence. Strangely enough, this leads me to this year's comic book adaptation ""Kick-Ass,"" in which Chlo Grace Moretz played a young vigilante superhero groomed by her father to be an unstoppable killing machine. I found the film reprehensible, in large part because a murderous eleven-year-old girl was depicted as something to be laughed at. A commenter on my review named Jason Bean posed an interesting question: How is it that ""Let the Right One In"" can be considered a work of art and ""Kick-Ass"" can be considered deplorable, especially when both feature children murdering people? The answer is simple: ""Let the Right One In,"" and likewise this American remake, doesn't treat violence as dismissible, emotionless camp; instead, it's treated as shocking, horrific acts of brutality. ""Let Me In"" is not the kind of film that gives you permission to laugh. Laughter would be a sign that you were never meant to see it.

There have been countless American remakes of foreign horror films. ""Let Me In"" is one of the few that deserves recognition. It stays true to its source without merely spitting it back at us with English-speaking actors; Reeves adds his own unique touches to the story, allowing it to stand apart from the original Swedish film. The greatest achievement of both versions of the film was the willingness to sidestep many of the overused vampire clich&eacute;s most have grown weary of; it's not a supernatural thriller so much as an unsettling examination of two lonely souls. This glimpse into the dark side of friendship makes it even more frightening, I believe, than most of what passes as a horror movie these days. Why waste your time on an empty teen slasher film when you have movies like this at your disposal?",1287619200,8,5493,4.74163179916318
4319808,5,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In is one of the most beautiful films of the year, and probably the best remake that I have ever seen. It is based on the Swedish film, Let The Right One In, which was released two years ago to monumental acclaim from both critics and art-house audiences alike. This touching story, concerning a young man's crush on a 12 year old vampire named Eli, captured the hearts and minds of everyone who was lucky enough to see it. If Ingmar Bergman were to direct a vampire-themed film, it would look a lot like this. However, one should not think of the film as yet another entry into the recent ""vampire"" craze. It is much more than that. This is the film that Twilight only wishes that it could be.

The remake deviates structurally from the original, only in that the opening is a bit different, and a few minor characters have been altered or dropped altogether. The integrity of the storytelling remains intact, and as a result, much of the remake resembles the original in all of its snow-drenched glory.

Kodi Smit-McPhee plays Owen, a lonely young man who is constantly bullied at school in the most brutal fashion. He spends his evenings at home playing with knives, and spying on the attractive neighbor next door. In addition to these disturbing quirks, he has an almost addictive fondness for Now and Laters, and constantly eats the candy throughout the film. Chloe Moretz plays Abby, a young girl who moves in next door with a man that we initially assume is her father. The two meet on the playground one night, and bond over the intricacies of a Rubick's Cube. Soon, Owen develops a crush on his new friend, oblivious that Abby is really a vampire, and that her ""dad"" is in fact a serial killer, who creeps out into the night, stalking and killing random victims in order to bring buckets of blood back to Abby, in order that she will survive.

Meanwhile, an older cop tries to figure out who the mysterious killer is, as the bodies continue to surface. As far as Owen is concerned, the bullying still continues at school, but with a little advice from Abby, and a little bit of weight training, Owen realizes that he can stand up for himself in one of the film's most shocking - and darkly comic - sequences. It doesn't take long for Owen to realize who and what Abby really is. In all of his fright and confusion, he decides to stay by her side, and as a result, Abby vows to protect Owen in the only way that she knows how.

As I said, this is one of the best films of the year. Both of the leads deserve Oscar nominations for their layered performances. The cinematography is breathtaking. The score is beautiful, although there are moments in the film that could do without a background score. This is my only criticism of this otherwise perfect film. Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) has crafted a worthy tribute with Let Me In.

It is worth mentioning that this film is rated R, and while the film centers on two adolescents, it is not a film for the 12 and under crowd. It is much too disturbing at times, and the language is pretty rough. I would also encourage Twilighters to see the film, so that they may have a clear example of a film (Let Me In) and a product (Twilight).",1287532800,230,3194,4.462328767123288
4319809,4,B004BLJQOK,"It must be an interesting experience: You have top billing in a Hollywood movie but you are too young to see it.  This film is rated R for good reasons.  The lead characters are very well-cast.

Stories about vampire children may be few.  We have Anne Rice's Claudia and S.P. Somtow's Timmy Valentine.  Eli (or Abby) is welcome.

For those who have read the book and know the vampire's secret, the Swedish film hints at it but the Hollywood remake does not go near it.  Fans of the original can be reassured.  This remake carves its own path, yet the reason it succeeds is that the story it tells, so close the novel, is still a good story.

In an interview, it was revealed that they filmed Abby's back-story, and it might be on the DVD.  It's not nearly as horrific as the novel.

It is true that Hollywood remakes of successful foreign films have a poor record.  It is not generally known but the John Houston film ""The Maltese Falcon"" was a remake of a version of the story of only a few years earlier.  I saw it on PBS once.  But we remember only the Houston version.  I do not know if ""Let Me In"" will surpass the original in time, perhaps not, but it stands on its own success.

I almost prefer this version.  I have to think about it, but I think the acting is better and cinematography was more powerful.  I like the subtle changes to the characterizations.  The boy may be in love with the girl, but he has not yet faced her wrath if she does not have her proper diet.  This vampire breaks the recent trend in beautiful, sexy, angst-driven creatures.  I like Michael Giacchino's musical score and have purchased several tracks.  The composer mixes the right amounts of sweetness and dread that make the thematic motif haunting and compelling.  The non-sequitur denouement at the pool is striking.  The resolution on the train is just as ambiguous as the original but more bittersweet.

Could it have been ""stronger"" in some parts if I imagine myself as the filmmaker?  Yes.  But some scene compositions take your breath away.

See this film, buy the soundtrack, and buy the DVD.  And, read the novel, also.",1287273600,6,2116,4.494736842105263
4319810,5,B004BLJQOK,"I have been and always will be a child of the 80s. So when I learned that not only was this movie taking place in that magical decade but also Chloe ""Hit Girl"" Moretz was playing the role of the vampire? I was more than a bit curious.

And I was pleasantly surprised!

A small, lonely boy in the midst of his parents messy divorce makes a new and unusual friend. His curiosity is first aroused by the girls preference of walking around at night with bare feet in the middle of winter. Also odd, his neighbors begin to disappear and the girl apparently has a taste for blood...even going so far as to lick it off the floor.

Chloe Moretz turns in yet another excellent performance as the troubled and lonely Vampire. But what thrilled me the most was how different it was from the current crop of bloodsucker movies. No bare chests, young men running around in short pants and other trappings of that Teeny Bopper garbage. What we have here is an deep and moving story with real feeling and actual emotion. The production values and art direction is excellent too.

4319811,1,B004BLJQOK,"I really can not come up with a proper way to outline this review, so I'm going to take my ""dartboard approach"" and just let the comments fly.

The acting was stiff. Everyone was SO slow it was difficult to tolerate. Saying your lines slow and in a low voice the whole movie doesn't build tension, doesn't add ambience, it doesn't do anything. Everyone's character seemed forced and it makes me sad to say that.

Okay, for anyone saying this was the American Director's take on the book, you're right. However, NEARLY EVERYTHING seemed like a shot for shot copy of the swedish film. Fair enough, they left out a few bits, but not much. If you say it isn't very similar-you either have not seen both movies or you're in denial.

WHAT HAPPENED TO OWEN? Part of the relationship between the two leads involve his slight ""violent urges"" and assorted hobbies which there was almost none of in this film. Wow...I saw him stab a tree. There was only really one other part where I felt they had ""Owen's"" character slightly accurate.

Did you know that in vampire movies people can still have energy? There was NONE in this film. Seriously, the pacing was terrible.

I know some of you may cry foul because I was hoping for a lot here. Yes, I own the swedish film and the book. The book is fantastic. The swedish film is okay. I would not call it god's gift to vampire movies- but it still beats this movie because the actors had energy. They didn't think being a vampire meant keeping your eyes on the ground the whole time.
And, I am not looking for a ""direct representation"" of the book either! I understand with film, directors like to take certain liberties etc... but (setting aside my personal feelings towards other media of the same story), this movie was JUST SO SLOW! And while I am saying I prefer the swedish film-I will provide this too- in the swedish film, i felt i was watching a friendship develop. It grew from nothing. In this version-it was cold and empty. Meaningless to all parties involved.

Overall, I know some will disagree, but really-with poor pacing, poor acting, and nothing really that new to watch, you may as well rent the original film, which certainly gets dry in parts but overall has more energy than this. Ignoring what they did with the story, you can't ignore the acting and pacing. And most of that responsibility lies on the director.

*I really really wanted to like this. I waited a whole year to see it, but after the movie was done, I shook my head and just left. I was not skeptic going in, but after that-I forever will be critical of any film or book I enjoyed being translated or put to different media. Again, forgetting the terrible atrocities to the story, it is just bad acting lacking chemistry, the pacing is terrible, the scenes felt choppy...it's a bad film.

Suggested INSTEAD: Let The Right One In (Swedish with English Theatrical subtitles) OR watching paint dry, grass grow, milk curdle, flys get zapped by the bug zapper ya bought at menards last year, perhaps an old Bing Crosby movie, a book, a bike ride, finally cleaning out that garage, or maybe even just staring at a stucco (or tile) wall thinking about last thanksgiving...you KNOW why. -Cheers",1286928000,20,3207,4.5846422338568935

Of course, that could simply be a matter of perspective:  If I had seen the Swedish version first, I might feel differently.  That being said, I loved this film (Let Me In).  Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Moretz) were outstanding.  An instant vampire classic -- as entertaining as Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire and Bram Stoker's Dracula.

4319813,4,B004BLJQOK,"The Swedish film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (based on the Swedish novel of the same name) was on my top ten list last year.  It was creepy, heartbreaking, violent, original, stylish & very well acted.  It tells the story of a deeply lonely young boy, bullied at school and torn between his divorced parents.  At 12, he's right on the cusp of young manhood...but still he is lagging slightly behind his classmates and thus is a friendless target for some pretty significant abuse.  A new tenant moves into the apartment next to his...and older, weary looking man and a girl about his age.

The two strike up a friendship when meeting to chat every night at the monkey bars by his apartment building.  The boy, while sweet and quiet, also is barely masking an urge to inflict violence on his tormentors.  The girl, while sad and mysterious, is drawn to her new neighbor.

We come to discover that the girl is a vampire and that the old man has been her companion for many years, and is her procurer of blood.  When he is nearly discovered in action one night...a chain of events is set off that puts everyone in serious peril.

The story invites us to sympathize and root for an extremely wicked creature...and we do.  The relationship that develops between the two youngsters (although we know the girl is hardly as young as she appears) is one of the most delicate and touching ""young romances"" we've ever seen...and we give ourselves over completely to their plight.

Why have I spent so much time describing a film that I'm not reviewing?  Because the American remake, called LET ME IN, tells the exact same story and has much the same effect.  Yet in the end, it is inferior to the original.

Both movies are roughly the same length.  Yet the European original manages to have more plot points.  For example, the boy (named Owen in America, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) travels to visit his father in the Swedish film, but never gets that far in the American.  These scenes were critical to showing just how disconnected the boy feels.  Also, the Swedish film introduces us to a whole network of unemployed friends, who hang out at local bars and take care of each other.  It is one of their own who falls victim to the vampire, and one of this group that investigates the incident.  The American film provides us with a fairly generic cop (Elias Koteas).

The Swedish film rarely relied on any special effects, but the American one uses CGI whenever we see the vampire attacking an adult victim.  Sadly, it is very badly accomplished CGI...and makes what should have been some pretty disturbing scenes almost laughable.

But the American film does give us Chloe Moretz (KICK ASS) as Abby, the young vampire.  She's an impressive young actor, and manages a very nice performance (as does Smit-McPhee).  She carries a sadness, because she knows just how different and how WRONG she is.  We can see these two, not as kindred spirits perhaps, but as two halves of a whole.

The American film takes place in 1983, in winter, in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  It was filmed on location...BUT the location holds no resonance.  It is just a generic, snowy, dreary small town.  I'm glad they filmed the movie in my home state...but they could have filmed it anywhere with snow.

It sounds like I'm hugely criticizing the film...but in reality, if you've not seen the original, LET ME IN should be a pretty terrific movie-going experience.  It takes the vampire genre and breathes new and very original life into it.  It is well acted and emotionally satisfying.  I wish the pace had sometimes been just a little bit faster...but overall, it is worthwhile.  It is most assuredly not for children...because the children in this film are not exactly models of virtue.  If I set the original production out of my mind, LET ME IN is a quiet but almost haunting little horror-romance that is unlike anything out of Hollywood in the last few years.",1286668800,26,3923,4.657933042212518
4319814,5,B004BLJQOK,"Let Me In Is Probably one of the Bigger surprises I've had this year. I', a HUGE Movie buff anymore and I got and see constant movies all year long. If it crosses my mind to see it sometime chances are I will. Let Me In was one of the movie I had no one to go with me so I just went myself. I went and saw the movie expecting good things because Let The Right One In Was in essence a good film. But Let Me Tell You. I was literally blown away, by the feel of this film. Crawling back to the theatre a couple times to see it again. (Yeah it's that good) THe Two Lead Roles (Owen And Abby) are delivered by Chloe And Schmitt is such a flawless way that you would expect them to have been acting for longer than a decade. The feel of the movie leaves you hopeful and touched. Even a heart of stone would soften a little for this film. The Chemistry between Abby and Owen grows at a slow, but much needed rate during the film. And Even the silent parts in the film hit home. Watching their relationship blossom, ad watching the bloody exchanges as previewed only dd more much needed tension to the film, while avoiding certain elements that would mae the movie seem otherwise inaccessable to the mainstream Audience. Let Me In delievers powerful preformances and a Wonderous Storyline to be experienced again and again. Thewait for it to be a Jewel in my collection will be a long wait indeed.",1286582400,13,1389,4.225563909774436
4319815,3,B004BLJQOK,"Another money-grabbing remake from Hollywood.  Oh well, at least it is a rehashing of one of the best horror films of the new millenium.  And I will admit, Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) does a very solid job.  I was kind of hoping for an exact shot for shot remake like Funny Games, even though that would be completely pointless.  Let Me In does make enough minor changes to give the story a bit of a new feel, although much is lost in comparison.  Even though it infuses more violence and graphic images, it somehow loses nearly all of the visceral impact the original conveyed.

Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) does a tremendous job as Abby, the mysterious new girl in town that only comes out at night.  I also enjoyed watching Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) as Owen, the lonely boy that gets bullied at school.  The two make a strange connection and rely on each other for support.

All the great scenes from the original are duplicated here--the murder in the woods, the feeding in the tunnel, the swimming pool slaughter.  The differences are pretty drastic though, regardless of the extra blood or more frantic feel.  They all fall well short of the intensity and suspense from The Right One.  There are some additional moments that include flesh burning and frozen corpses that are worth mentioning.

It's always good to see a quality horror film be embraced and supported on the big screen.  Hopefully Let Me In will encourage others to checkout the original

Bottom line--entertaining, but inferior.",1286496000,6,1510,4.821011673151751
4319816,4,B004BLJQOK,"The cynic in me hates the reasons for recreating one of 2008's greatest films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-The-Right-One-In/dp/B001MYIXAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let The Right One In</a>&nbsp;or Lt den rtte komma in, an absolutely perfect romantic horror film that didn't need to be remade at all, much less only two years later.  The reasons are simple; the American audience that fills up theaters is much less likely to show up to a film that is in Swedish and lacks the special effects hooks and quasi-starpower of this remake.  Regardless if it is a remake or not, Let the Right One In is a superior film and I preface this review of its Americanized remake with the highest recommendation I can possibly give to the original.  However, do not let this play down entirely the fact that Let Me In is overall a terrifically disturbing and enjoyable horror film in its own right.

The film takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico and follows a sad twelve year old outcast named Owen (called Oskar in the 2008 movie).  Owen is neglected by his selfish parents and abused, sometimes brutally, by his peers at school.  He's easy to like but has some quirks that really put his relationship with the audience under scrutiny.  Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who won't get the credit his co-star Chloe Moretz will get in many circles but deserves it just the same.  Owen gets a new neighbor in Abby (played by Moretz, who was great earlier this year as Hit Girl in the super hero action comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG983M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>), a strange girl who doesn't wear shoes in the snow and seems altogether careless about her appearance.  Owen and Abby grow to have a wonderful relationship and although the film's sense of romance didn't hook me in as deeply as the original film did, it still works.  The major obstacle to Owen and Abby's budding friendship is simple; she is a vampire.  The supporting cast is great here and the although Elias Koteas's character was not present in the 2008 film, he is a welcome addition if only for the fact that this guy is a such a fantastic actor.  Richard Jenkins, an actor who dominated every frame of another great 2008 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Visitor/dp/B0015OKWKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Visitor</a>, plays the role of Abby's ""father"" and protector.  He is, as always, amazing.

I have to give director Matt Reeves (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>) credit for giving this story the respect it deserves.  He is a very good filmmaker and knows how to make an audience uncomfortable while also connecting to the characters.  He loses some points for taking on a project that either he or the producers merely intended to cash in on, and despite having some meticulous aesthetic strengths he only imitates the over powering atmosphere of the original film.  I don't like some of the special effects used for Abby, in particular the obvious use of CGI, but others will.  I didn't like that the film pulled some punches in areas that might make a more broad audience uncomfortable.  On the other hand I thought that one scene in particular was actually an improvement from the original.  Still, the original can't be touched and shame on them for trying.  But in the end this is a very good horror film by any standard and you should see it before Halloween, because it will be much better than the other garbage you'll be asked to see through endless obnoxious advertisements in the coming weeks.",1286496000,5,3761,5.427835051546392
4319817,5,B004BLJQOK,"""Let Me In"" seems to take some of the 'glamour' out of vampirism when compared to the stylistic bloodsucking movies of late, i.e. the ""Twighlight"" series.  I won't go into a lot of detail so I don't act as spoiler, but I'll just say that if vampires walked the earth, I think they would live a life more similar to the fanged-teeth characters in this movie.

I haven't seen the original movie this film is based upon, so I can't make a comparison between the two; I just know I thought this film was very good overall.  Recent newcomers Chlo Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee did a nice job in the two lead roles, while Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas added credibility to the casting in strong supporting nods.

The plot in this movie involves Smit-McPhee's character, Owen, being targeted by school bullies and subsequently befriending his new neighbor, Moretz's character, Abby.  Abby helps Owen see that he can't let himself be bullied to no end, but rather needs to stand up for himself if he wants to get enjoyment out of life.  As Abby and Owen's friendship grows, Owen does begin to defend himself against his thug peers, and Abby provides extra support when needed.  Their friendship also spawns unique situations that also lie at the heart of the movie's theme.

Bottom line: ""Let Me In"" combines an interesting story with high-level acting to create a unique movie within the vampire realm.",1286236800,9,1396,4.739669421487603
4319818,5,B004BLJQOK,"Like many who were fortunate enough to see the the fantastic Swedish film, 'Let the Right One In' I was a little more than annoyed at Hollywood for allowing only a scant two years to pass before attempting to remake this film. If they were going to remake this film, they should have let at little more time pass by, especially since they were going to remake a film that was considered by fans and critics to be a masterpiece, and possibly one of the greatest horror films that has ever been made. Couldn't they have waited  another 5, maybe 10 years so that the original could actually settle in and take its place in the pantheon of horror movie classics. No. Hollywood, in its incessant drive to horde as much money as possible, decided to commit sacrilege and go ahead with its' remake anyway.

However as the premiere for the movie approached, and the glowing reviews began to stream in, I was intrigued.  Was it possible for 'Let Me In' to be in the same class as 'Let the Right One In?'  Is the child actress from 'Kick Ass' really that great, and is the kid from 'The Road' really that affecting as Owen, the boy who is brutally bullied without impunity by his three tormentors.  After seeing the film, I grudgingly have to say yes.

'Let Me In' is just as good a movie as 'Let the Right One In'. 'Let Me In' is very faithful to the original in many ways, but the new director, Matt Reeves, does inject some of his own vision into his adaptation of the brilliant book that this movie is based on. First, the violence and emotion in 'Let Me In' is a lot more visceral and aggressive than it was in the original film. Matt Reeves films most of his movie through closeups, and when a violent act is committed or a person is suffering emotionally, the film goer is impacted more forcefully. Chloe Moretz's(Hitgirl from Kickass) character in the film embodies this films aggression. She is the vampire who charms people with her 12 year old facade, but when she is hungry for blood, she morphs into a crazed killing machine. Abby kills without reservation because it is in her nature to do so. And when she kills in this film she freaking kills.  She rips skin, she breaks bones, and emits a banshee like wail while doing the deed. There are more scenes in this film that illustrate this movie's more aggressive take on the source material than the original film, and this may offend some people. But the aggressive nature of this film appealed to a different side of my sensibility.

The great thing about both of these movies is the focus on the relationship that develops between two very lonely people. Abby, the vampire, is a 250 year old being who is trapped inside the body of a 12 year old girl.  Owen, as I've stated above, is a 12 year boy who is mercilessly bullied at school, ignored by his mother, and is emotionally disconnected from his father. Abby and Owen suffer through an oppressive loneliness because of their respective situations.  When they find each other on a cold night in a desolate town in New Mexico, a relationship between the two principles ensues.  However, at the beginning, Abby enters into the relationship with caution, while Owen, who is so desperate for companionship, is frustrated by Abby's reluctance. Abby even warns Owen that they can't be friends at their relationship's inception. But after a while, Abby becomes intrigued by and then eventually begins to care for Owen and Owen for Abby. Abby and Owen develop an unbreakable bond, much to the dismay of Abby's ""father"" and they are soon bound to protect each other from harm. They provide a much needed companionship for each other, and they will protect their relationship at any cost, even if the continuation of their relationship calls for the sacrifice of the people who are in their lives. But when you're dealing with two lonely and suffering twelve year old kids, could you expect anything different?

The acting is great from all of the principle actors. Richard Jenkins and Elias Coteas each shine in their roles as the ""father"" and the cop who investigate the ""ritual"" murders taking place in the small town.  But it is the two kids who create an indelible impact in the viewers mind. Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smith McPhee are both twelve years old, but their acting is so beyond their respective ages. Kodi Smith McPhee is amazing as Owen.  His performance invites sympathy for his plight, but he also provides us with a glimpse of his character's potential as a future sociopath when he indulges in his fantasies of killing people, and creepily spies on the neighbors in his apartment complex.  Chloe Moretz is equally effective as Abby, projecting sadness, innocence, world weariness, and craftiness through her characterization of Abby. Even the bullies who torment Owen are great, especially the leader who injects his character with a muscular brutality that his counterpart in the original film did not have. In the book, the main bully is written as someone who is quite capable of murder, and the boy who plays him in this film really gives you that impression.

So give this movie a chance.  I promise that you won't regret it. It is so much better than the horror movies that the American public has to sit through now a days. This movie doesn't focus on devising creative ways for one person to inflict violence on another person(Saw and Hostel) as a means to create horror. ""Let Me In"" performs a study of horror based upon dysfunctional relationships, and the psychological damage that these relationships can inflict.  The violence that takes place in the film is a necessary counterpart to the story, and a necessity for the main character, not a means for amusement. So when Abby does kill, you're not tempted to roll your eyes and groan because of absurdity. And it is not just Abby, every character in this film does what they do out of necessity, not gratuity.

Oh, and read the book that both films are based on.  You will be thoroughly affected by the book.  I guarantee it.",1286236800,15,6005,4.651558073654391
4319819,5,B004BLJQOK,"Wow....this film had a whole new take on the vampire premise. The cinematography was so well executed throughout, you were dying to see what the characters saw, what a mysterious beginning they choose to start with, so much tension builds up during the obvious bloody violence in the camera's peripheral vision with each vicious death enacted by 'Abby'. Which brings me to mention that LET ME IN is truly a career highlight for the young but so talented Chlo Grace Moretz. She plays her role with such aberrance & grimness. Despite being a remake, this flick has enough blood on it's teeth to stand alone, definitely have to buy this when it's released to dvd.

4319820,5,B004BLJQOK,"The Review:

Spoiler Alert- I've intentionally been vague in my description of events in the film and have endeavored not to discuss anything you couldn't glean from the theatrical preview.  But nonetheless there's bound to be a spoiler or two in the following review.

Let Me In is the American remake of the Swedish Film, Let The Right One In, based on the bestselling novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  With incredibly strong performances by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Clo Moretz, who played Hitgirl in the excellent Kick Ass, Let Me In earns a special place in the increasingly crowded vampire urban fantasy subgenre.  I've rarely seen such young actors carry a film on their shoulders the way these two have.

Set in New Mexico in the winter of 1983, Let Me In tells the story of Owen, a lonely 12 year old, bullied mercilessly at school.  His parents are in the midst of an acrimonious divorce and he spends his nights by himself in the courtyard of his apartment building playing and devouring candy.  There aren't any other kids in his apartment building until one night when Abby and her dad move into the apartment next door.  Owen quickly realizes that Abby isn't like other girls.  She walks barefoot in the snow, smells a little funny and seems way out of touch.  Owen also hears strange noises coming through his bedroom wall from Abby's apartment.  The audience learns in short order that Abby is in fact no ordinary little girl and that the relationship between her and her father is unnatural to say the least.

Let Me In is quite a subversive bit of storytelling.  It turns many clich&eacute;s on their heads.  The kids in the film are not innocent little angels.  Owen, who is constantly preyed upon by bullies, steals from his mother's purse, acts out violent power fantasies, and shows a few of the warning signs of becoming a future serial murderer.  Abby, while she has the face of an angel, is anything but.  By the time you reach the film's end and reflect on her relationships with her father and Owen, you may be surprised to find that she is actually quite a manipulative and a hugely destructive force.  Her guile is never overt, and remarkably I found myself feeling a lot of sympathy for her despite her showing herself to be capable of some truly brutal behavior.

Let Me In also succeeds in its use of subtlety.  The most effective scenes in the film, including its climax are more effective for what isn't shown.  Appearances are deceiving, and the film challenges the audience to fill in some of the blanks and ponder why Abby and her father are the way they are and what the future holds for Abby and Owen.  It's dark and disturbing.  Although its leads aren't old enough to drive, Let Me In is very much a film for adults.  While it has some intense gore and violence, it's not gratuitous.  It's a smart film that blurs the line between good and evil and it's ending should leave you feeling very conflicted about who the good guys and bad guys are, or whether the distinction has any meaning in the context of the film.  If you want to experience a unique, tightly written, character driven vampire film, then do yourself a favor, and go see Let Me In.

4319821,5,B004BLJQOK,"""Let Me In"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Twelve-year old Owen is viciously bullied by his classmates and neglected by his divorcing parents. Achingly lonely, Owen spends his days plotting revenge on his middle school tormentors and his evenings spying on the other inhabitants of his apartment complex. His only friend is his new neighbor Abby, an eerily self-possessed young girl who lives next door with her silent father. A frail, troubled child about Owen's age, Abby emerges from her heavily curtained apartment only at night and always barefoot, seemingly immune to the bitter winter elements. Recognizing a fellow outcast, Owen opens up to her and before long, the two have formed a unique bond. When a string of grisly murders puts the town on high alert, Abby's father disappears, and the terrified girl is left to fend for herself. Still, she repeatedly rebuffs Owen's efforts to help her and her increasingly bizarre behavior leads the imaginative Owen to suspect she's hiding an unthinkable secret.

The cast led by Kodi Smit-Mcphee (as Owen) & Chloe Grace Moretz (as Abby), who, both give, excellent performances, is excellent! The directing & screenplay (by the novel & screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist) by Matt Reeves (who also directed ""Cloverfield"" (2008) is excellent!

The production design by Ford Wheeler (who also did the production design to ""We Own The Night"" (2007), ""Rachel Getting Married"" (2008) & ""Greenberg"" (2010) is excellent! The art direction by Guy Barnes (who also did the art direction to ""The Missing"" (2003), ""Suspect Zero"" (2004), ""Seraphim Falls"" (2006), ""Brothers"" (2009) & the upcoming ""The Resident"" (2010 or 2011) is excellent! The set decoration by Wendy Ozols-Barnes (who also did the set decoration to ""The Missing"", ""Suspect Zero"", ""Seraphim Falls"", ""Brothers"" & the upcoming ""The Resident"") is excellent! The costume design by Melissa Bruning is excellent!

This is an excellent and well-made movie that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time, as well as heart racing. This is one of the best horror films of the year, if not, the best. It is also one of the best films of the year, so far.
