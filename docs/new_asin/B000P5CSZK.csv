8188974,5,B000P5CSZK,"This DVD by Miss Kozacek is much more demanding then her first one. Harder exercises, I can not finish it. But for younger persons it would be perfect.",1513468800,,151,4.428571428571429
8188975,5,B000P5CSZK,"As an active senior who wants to stay fit without injury, this is an excellent workout. Including the instructor, there are two additional exercisers: one shows the routine sitting down in a chair; the other shows the routine with added moves for a more intense workout. No matter which person one models after, you will still work up a sweat, which is important for burning calories and overall fitness. The approximate 40-min workout includes warm up, exercises with hand-held weights, exercises with resistance bands, exercises for promoting good balance, and a cool down. This workout shows one doesn't have to hop around or do big moves across the floor to be effective. I especially like the use of resistance bands to help build up muscle strength after recent surgeries. I discovered the DVD at my local library and liked it so much I decided to order it.",1504051200,,863,4.877551020408164

8188981,3,B000P5CSZK,Ms. Kozacek presents a series of well-cued practical exercises. It's just that the workout is too long for my needs (48 minutes).  I thought I would be able to select upper or lower body workshouts for alternate days. You are not able to self-select your workouts.  Other than that one gets a good workout if you have the time.,1358726400,,327,4.52542372881356
