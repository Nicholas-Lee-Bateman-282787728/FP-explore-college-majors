2712191,3,B000LPS3AS,"A Bloody Reunion (Dae-wung Lim, 2006)

A Bloody Reunion, first and foremost, is nothing new. It's your basic slasher movie, equal parts Humongous and Slaughter High. But for a slasher movie, especially one made well after the golden age of the slasher film was long gone (and even the brief nineties revival had disappeared into well-deserved obscurity), it's not a bad little film, a refreshing bit of nostalgia for slasher-movie fans who've gotten sick of their collection of holiday-themed eighties flicks.

The story begins a number of years (fifteen? If it's stated I didn't catch it) after its six main characters have graduated from high school. They are summoned to the oceanside cottage of Mrs. Park, one of their teachers, for a reunion. (While this seems obvious from the American title, note that the film's original name was To Sir, with Love.) Everything seems to be going along swimmingly, but when the crew convene for a big dinner, cracks start showing in the facade, and we eventually realize that Mrs. Park was a mean old harridan in the classroom, possibly because of her deformed son (made to live in the basement, naturally), and that she was especially hard on this particular group of kids because they made fun of her son through the basement window. Or something. In any case, someone starts chopping the kids up, and all the evidence points to said deformed kid, but is it him? Is he even still alive? After all, Mrs. Park does have another child, a daughter, and none of the graduates attending the reunion is exactly stable...

It's fun, if predictable. When it comes to slasher movies, all the tension comes not from wondering if someone will die, but in what order people will die. (After all, what was the last slasher movie you saw where it wasn't obvious who the final girl was by the time you'd finished with the opening credits?) The actual death scenes are somewhat surprising in their violence, even for a slasher film, though as far as these things go the gore is kept to a tasteful minimum. (Note that I say both of those things in relative terms, as I'm trying to convince a general audience to watch this, rather than the hardcore slasher fans who will probably have already seen it.) It's a fun little movie, high quality for the genre and not overly silly, and you'll get a kick out of it. Just don't expect anything earth-shaking. ** ",1263600000,,2379,4.739130434782608

Pretty straightforward; more a horror movie than a suspense movie.",1217030400,,108,6.266666666666667
2712193,4,B000LPS3AS,"bloodier than most korean horror thati have seen.
has less of a depth of plot as well.
and some parts are disjointed in certain ways.
yet the bit of misdirection was pretty interesting.
I figured it out about halfway through...
still its a nice film to watch on a humdrum day.",1208563200,,276,4.431372549019608
2712194,2,B000LPS3AS,Like other reviewers. You're probably tired of the Asian ghost story. You seen one you seen them all. This was a breath of fresh air. I could tell that did put alot of American slasher films thought. The bunny mask reminds me of the New Halloween with little Michael. Toward the end of the film finding out the killer we thought as kinda predictable because I wonder why I hadn't seen character roaming around anywhere. But the end was a good twist. If your tired of watching ghost girls popping out of everything even you popcorn this film is for you.,1196985600,,552,4.475247524752476
2712195,4,B000LPS3AS,"Bloody Reunion is not your typical Asian horror film. There are no ghosts or spirits...no dark-haired girls crawling out of wells, no creepy little kids staring ominously...no, at it's core Bloody Reunion is a good ol', American influenced slasher film. The plot is standard 1980's slasher fare as the former students of an elementary school gather at her home for a reunion with their ailing teacher. An opening prologue shows police discovering several mutilated bodies at the home with only two survivors: the teacher, Mrs. Park and one of the female former students, Nam Mi-Ja. Mi-Ja relates the whole tale to a police detective while in the hospital.

She had come to Mrs. Park's home to take care of the sickly teacher and thought it would be nice to throw a reunion with some of her former students. The include Se-Ho and Eun-Young who are now married, the athletic Dal-bong, tough guy Myung-ho, the ""shy guy"" Jung-won, and pretty Sun Hee. The reunion is pleasant at first as old friends become reacquainted and they gather for a BBQ outside Mrs. Park's seaside home. As the alcohol flows, pent-up resentments bubble to the surface. It seems Mrs. Park mistreated all of her students in some way, leading to them becoming losers in life. She made fun of Sun-hee for being overweight leading to an addiction to cosmetic surgery; she hurt Dal-bong's led, preventing him from becoming an athlete; she ridiculed Eun-young for being poor, etc...

As the group splinters into factions, some blaming Mrs. Park while others support her, a killer is stalking about. There are some rather creative and gory kills in Bloody Reunion that certainly make the film live up to its name...One victim is bound with his mouth wide open as the killer pours broken pieces of utility blades down his throat and washes it down with a nice drink of water...that was fairly inventive. We're led to believe the killer is Mrs. Park's deformed son who was kept in the basement and would wear a bunny mask to cover his disfigured face. The killer wears the same mask.

A staple of Asian horror films is the twist ending and Bloody Reunion is no different. Unfortunately the twist ending here in the last 15 minutes undermines the rest of the film, and completely changes everything you just saw. I had to watch the last 15 minutes a couple of times to figure out what had just happened. It was a bit of confusing curveball that wasn't needed. I guess the director, Dae-wung Lim, wanted a twist that set his film apart from his American counterparts but part of the fun of those films was that we knew who the killer was in the first reel and we watched for the mayhem. The trickery here only served to derail what had been a pretty good slasher film.

One other issue I have with Bloody Reunion is the camera work. There are a few times in the film where the camera zooms in and out constantly within a matter of seconds, leaving the viewer disoriented. It was like a bad effect from a 1950's 3D movie. Very weird.

I will grade Bloody Reunion up a bit as it does come with a host of special features including commentary, interviews with cast members, special effects featurette, photo galleries, and trailers.

2712196,3,B000LPS3AS,"To sum it up, not too bad for what it is.  The film has no pretensions; there are no veneers or splashes of high art to be found. Basically an amalgamation of 80's slashers, expect everything but the kitchen sink, gaping plot holes, and plenty of blood.  The story itself is borderline ridiculous and entirely unbelievable while the characters are one dimensional and generally uninteresting.  Having said this, the execution is well done, some of the scenes quite startling, and there is sufficient bloodshed to meet's one's deranged expectations.  The acting, though hystrionic at times, is uniformly impressive. The film doesn't tread any new territory, but sometimes, while sitting with the lights dimmed low and curled up on the couch, it's reassuring to know what's coming around the corner.",1173484800,11,797,5.155038759689923
8163321,5,B000LPS3AS,I bought this for my spouse.  It is one of her favorite movies.  She loves it.,1464134400,,78,3.8125
8163322,3,B000LPS3AS,"I personally adore this movie. S. Korea doesn't let down with their horror films. They always keep the viewer at the edge of their seats. This films does an excellent job of doing that. What starts as a school reunion among classmates and their old school teacher turns into something else plus a plot twist! If you enjoy Korean movie plot twists, I'd highly recommend this movie.",1385942400,,380,4.686567164179104
8163323,2,B000LPS3AS,"I ended up watching this last night and I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed. Not because of the twist at the end as much as there just wasn't a huge amount of movement in this film. I was prompted to buy this at my local video store after seeing the positive reviews on Amazon and while I can see where this film would appeal to some viewers, none of my group really overly cared for this flick.

One of the things that's good about the film is that like others have said, Bloody Reunion doesn't try to hide what it is. This is essentially a semi-gory slasher film created on a budget. Once the murders start happening, the film isn't overly bad. They're decently gory, although if you're looking for something more extreme then you'll probably be slightly disappointed. Despite shots on the back of the DVD box of bloody eyeballs and mouths held open by contraptions, the scenes here are fairly short and to the point when it comes to that sort of thing. Gore hounds will be mildly interested but know that they've seen better. The acting is probably one of the better things about the film. The cast does their best to hold Bloody Reunion above water, but they're hampered by a script that seems to bland itself out at times more than entrap and entice.

I guess what kind of killed this film for me was that it felt far longer than it's 96 minute length. My friends and I had a good time poking fun at the film while viewing it, but I can't say that any of us were particularly entertained by the movie itself. Every once in a while you'd have a good scene come up, but ultimately this film was a little boring. I like that the filmmaker tried to avoid it being nothing but jump scares and cliches, but this just needed a little something more. By the time it starts getting interesting towards the end, you're fairly numbed up by the slowness of the preceding events.

This seems to be a film that's rather decisive: you're either going to adore it or you're going to hate it. My recommendation would be to rent it via Netflix or another avenue rather than purchasing it.",1364256000,,2086,4.398963730569948
8163324,4,B000LPS3AS,"Bloody Reunion is a great horror film from South Korea. It's a lot better than many modern slashers, although it shares many similarities. The story is about a class reunion where most of the students blame their teacher for their miserable lives. Soon, the students begin experiencing terrible deaths. The story is great and emotional, mainly because of the great acting. It may sound generic, but wait until you get to the shocking ending. The movie is very bloody, and has some unique and brutal death scenes. *minor spoiler* There is a scene where the killer cuts a box cutter into smaller pieces and drops them into a victim's mouth- followed by boiling water! I also liked the creepy imagery spread throughout the film. It kept my attention all the way through. The storytelling was a little confusing at times, though.

Overall, Bloody Reunion is a great horror film. It has breaks away from the generic slasher genre, and still manages to scare and shock- and, more importantly, manages to entertain. I highly recommend Bloody Reunion, as of 8/19/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

This film has strong violence and gore, no sex or nudity.",1345334400,,1162,4.893401015228426
8163325,5,B000LPS3AS,"Bloody Reunion is another Asian film that really kept my attention and made me say REALLY? at the end.
A retired teacher lives by the sea with an ex student taking care of her as she isn't able to care for herself.
The student arranges for a class reunion knowing the teacher is very ill and would like to see them again.
What ensues is a bloodbath and many twists and turns.
at the Reunion resentment begins to build from each student because the teacher has in some way ruined their life by her tough say before you think style of teaching and abuse in one form or another inflicted upon each one.
The teacher had a deformed baby that she and her husband kept locked in the basement who at the time she was teaching was the same age as the students.
There was a window in the basement and the children would go and play with her son while he was wearing a mask but when his horrific distorted face was revealed all of them stayed away except one, who then made him a rabbit mask and was kind to him.
This is a very gory slasher with creative kills and kills that depict severe hatred from whomever is killing them one by one.
So,who is that killer,they all have motive.it will keep you guessing until the very last second",1319932800,4,1223,4.275862068965517
8163326,5,B000LPS3AS,"OK, I'm going to say it: this is a classic. Very few horror films really deliver, but this one does in spades! I rank this with Psycho, The Exorcist, The Others, The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, Rear Window, etc.  An engrossing film that focuses on a horror that is never addressed: the horror of neglect. True neglect. This is more than a slasher film, more than a mystery, more than a thriller. I can only say that if you watch only one ""horror"" movie this year, watch this one. A remarkable ensemble cast of young people (as well as the woman who plays the teacher). All of them deserve to have brilliant careers in the future.  As far as the DVD itself, there are great extras included.",1294531200,,694,4.4140625
8163327,4,B000LPS3AS,"Director Dae-wung Lim brings a touch of classic American Horror to Korean cinema in this dark and ultra-violent Slasher film! BLOODY REUNION follows a group of old classmates that return to the home of their sickly grade-school teacher for one final visit with her before she dies. Their trip sparks bitter memories and past rivalries, but are these hurtful childhood experiences enough to drive one of them to kill? Each of the standard conventions of the Slasher sub-genre have been adapted into this unique hybrid, including a number of blood-splattered deaths and a creepy killer in a blank bunny mask. BLOODY REUNION also draws influence from other Korean revenge thrillers like OLDBOY, where the victims are brutally punished for innocent and seemingly insignificant indiscretions that they committed when they were younger. The characters and mood of the picture travel on a slow downward spiral as a series of flashbacks reveal that their ""beloved"" Miss Park was actually quite cruel to each of her students, giving each of them a motive to kill while driving the tension and suspense. With an ample amount of gore, solid performances, and a surprising twist ending, BLOODY REUNION is a smart and engaging Slasher that lives up to its title!

8163328,4,B000LPS3AS,"A horror film buff, I can't believe I had never heard of this movie until I came across it On Demand. Not a fan of gore, though it comes with the territory, I'm intrigued with Asian horror. The genre breaks out of the box with twists and a super high ""creepiness"" factor. Bloody Reunion (To Sir With Love) is no exception. This flick is a labyrinth of mind games and creepy moments that transition into true horror. In a short time frame, Bloody Reunion weaves a puzzling, frightening, psychological and surprising blanket of terror. It jumps into your conciousness and leaves you unnerved. There are no boring spots and unneccesary explanations. There is definitely gore, but it's not the kind usually stirred up by the typical knife-wielding villain. NOT for kids.",1282953600,,766,4.854961832061068

8163330,4,B000LPS3AS,"Finally, an Asian horror film that does not feature a pasty-faced, black-ring-eyed child lurking at the bottom of a well or slinking through a crawlspace. Six of Mrs Parks ex-students are invited by her caregiver to Mrs Parks secluded home to cheer up the sickly wheelchair bound woman. Turns out Mrs Parks is not a candidate for a ""Golden Apple"" award and she has in one way or another ruined the lives of the 6 students. And Mrs Parks is not a candidate for mother of the year either.  She gave birth to a facially deformed son whom she keeps locked in the cellar wearing a crude, paper bunny mask. When Mr Parks went to see the child in the hospital he just goes home and hangs himself.

The backyard party soon goes awry with truths revealed, resentments toward Mrs Parks and among the guests is a former student a very shy young man the others ridiculed but seemed to be teachers pet.  But this is a horror movie and soon the group separates and one by one they are murdered by someone wearing a crudely painted bunny mask.

The only survivors of the bloodbath is the caregiver and Mrs Parks, in fact the entire movie is told to the police by the caregiver.  LIAR! LIAR! PANTS ON FIRE. (Any more detail than that would be a spoiler)

The movie has its share of gore and gross like eyelids stapled OPEN.Ants fed into someones ear, and a mouthful of razor blades chased down by some tea.  It seems the South Koreans are like the Brits--they'll swallow anything with tea. LOL

The movie is pretty good as long as you don't mind squinting, reading the sub-titles and being duped into accepting a character who doesn't exist.  LIAR! LIAR! PANTS ON FIRE.",1271548800,2,1653,4.483333333333333
