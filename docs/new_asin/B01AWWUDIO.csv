7613736,5,B01AWWUDIO,"I remember old school Saturday Matinee at the local movie theatre, when it was independently owned. And you had Cartoons before the movie. And movies like The Sinbad Movies. With the film breaking part way thru.  ",1507334400,,213,4.888888888888889

7613738,5,B01AWWUDIO,Love these cartoons and had been wanting this for awhile! It reminds me of my '70s childhood of getting up on Saturday mornings when cartoons really meant something. Amazing that John Byner voiced both characters here and that the ant was supposed to be Dean Martin and the aardvark is supposed to be comedian Jackie Mason! The Instant Hole episode is probably my favorite but all of them are great! Funny stuff and glad I purchased it!,1504483200,,436,4.675324675324675

7613741,5,B01AWWUDIO,"As with the Original Pink Panther and The Inspector the Ant and Aardvark is just a classic! They don't make cartoons like this for kids
anymore! I use to watch all 3 of these as a kid and when they finally came out on DVD I had to have them. They are so funny and witty
and even with the harmless violence! unlike the garbage today and especially with the leftist brainwashing propaganda in cartoons and
kids shows! Buy these for any family members especially the young kids! Love John Byner's voice! wow was he good! again a classic!",1500854400,,534,4.404040404040404

7613757,5,B01AWWUDIO,"I may be old but I still love this cartoon. It is one of the better ones from my younger days. I have watched this many times and still laugh.

This is something that you can watch over and over. It is very safe to watch with anyone. I can not say one negative thing on this.

If you like cartoons give this one some serious thought. The ant is very clever and gets the aardvark every time. My favorite episode is instant hole. I can watch this every day and not get sick of it.

If anything happens to this, I am going to purchase this again.",1476576000,,543,4.0092592592592595

7613761,5,B01AWWUDIO,"Originally produced in 1969-1971, ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" cartoons were instant classics. I never saw them in the theater (cartoons used to precede features quite frequently), but did see them on television as part of the Pink Panther series (which I also love). This DVD contains all 17 episodes as well as a couple of notable commentary tracks and two documentaries, both of which were fascinating and presented a lot of information I didn't previously know.

I always loved the garish colors and stylized backgrounds in these shorts, and after watching all these in a marathon I think the series holds up amazingly well, and I am particularly fond of ""Technology, Phooey"" and ""Scratch a Tiger"". Of course John Byner, who voiced the characters, deserves a lot of credit for the success of this series as his vocalizations of the two main characters and their interactions gave their individual personalities a loveable patina that was vital to the success of the show. This is a great package that looks and sounds great and has wonderful bonuses, and it helped me remember why ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" was always a favorite of mine. Highly recommended for all ages.",1473379200,4,1173,4.894472361809045

7613763,5,B01AWWUDIO,"Another of the Pink Panther's affiliates, the Ant and the Aardvark, is now on DVD & Blu-ray; all 17 shorts of them in their original Fullscreen format! With the popularity of the Ant and the Aardvark, it's amazing they never went past 17 shorts during those early years. You'll get a lot of bang for your bucks with this wacky collection of predator vs. prey by DePatie-Freleng, and the prey wins, like the Road Runner against Wile E. Coyote! There's a few bonuses; 2 documentaries also used in The Inspector and CrazyLegs Crane's sets, and several commentaries by several renowned toon historians! I did notice a small boo-boo with the short ""Technology, Phooey""; the picture and sound were off-kilter by a second or 2! Jon Byner played both characters in the styles of Jackie Mason and Dean Martin, causing the former actor to realize he was outdone by an imitating actor for the Aardvark, causing DePatie-Freleng to pay Mason a small royalty fee! Add the Ant and the Aardvark to your collection of the Pink Panther's affiliates on DVD or Blu-ray today!",1471478400,2,1055,4.802197802197802

7613771,5,B01AWWUDIO,"I haven't watched these cartoons in years.  Amazon is the best place to find anything, old or new.  Interesting story about how Friz Freleng started his own studio after leaving Warner Brothers, that gave us The Pink Panther, The Ant and The Aardvark, and so many more.  The Aardvark reminds me of Wile E. Coyote.  Good, Classic, Fun, from an old, classic cartoon team!",1467072000,,369,4.71875

I remember these airing on Sunday mornings with Pink Panther, The Inspector, and Tijuana (aka Texas) Toads. The picture quality is outstanding--they did a great job restoring these. Menus are widescreen but the shorts themselves are presented in original aspect ratio (1.33:1), matted left and right, just as they should be.",1465948800,11,403,5.2153846153846155
