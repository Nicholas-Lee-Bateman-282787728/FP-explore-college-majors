7753840,4,B01G3MKOXQ,"If you like Sophia Loren, or Cary Grant, or Frank Sinatra and you are willing to suspend any semblance of logic descending into the delusional this is your movie.  The actual star is a darn BIG cannon.  It is this cannon that a group of Spanish partisans cart around the countryside on the way to using it to liberate a city by knocking down it stall walls.  Her you run into the suspension of belief problem in that you are expected to accept Frank Sinatra as a simple Spanish shoemaker albeit leader of the partisans added to it with a VERY bad accent.  Then there is Ms. Loren with her obvious Italian heritage passing as a Spanish woman torn between her acceptance of the goal of their journey while being nuts about both Frank and Cary.  finally their is Cary Grant as an English artillery officer along to both help them fire the cannon as well as to take possession of it for England after the mission.  Still with all this I liked it as good escapist fictional movie watching.",1480636800,2,984,4.438888888888889
7753841,4,B01G3MKOXQ,"The plot is as heavy as the cannon that they pull across the Spanish countryside, but the three major stars literally carry this film. Cary Grant and Sophia Loren are at the height of their film presence. Frank Sinatra does his best to play a peasant who loves his country and yearns for freedom from the French Occupiers. The movie fails as an epic but succeeds as cinematic entertainment.",1476662400,2,390,4.666666666666667

7753843,4,B01G3MKOXQ,A Napoleonic adventure which takes place in Spain following the annexation of that country by the French causing ancient enemies to come together as the Spanish are in revolt  and seek British aid. A naval officer is sent to assist by taking charge of a giant cannon. However the guerrillas have set the sights on using the cannon to free a city after which the British may have it. This results in moving the cannon to the place whilst eluding the French in order to carry out their initiative.,1475107200,,495,4.561797752808989
7753844,4,B01G3MKOXQ,A much underated film and long awaited by some of rate it higher than some reviewers. The Blu-ray edition is superior in definition and colour to the older DVD release but for some reason is shorn of som eof the original VistaVision picture information at the top and bottom of the frame. In addition to thsi it is slightly out of focus of the left and right of frame - neither of these points may bother most viewers but those that highly praise VistaVision may be a bit disappointed. These points appart it is better quality than the existing DVD and well worth having and it should be worth noting that I always expect perfection and dpeneding on the master supplied this is not always possible. Four out of five for ths one. KW,1474588800,6,731,4.462686567164179

7753846,3,B01G3MKOXQ,"The Pride and the Passion,"" directed by Stanley Kramer, combines the talents of three stars   Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, and Sophia Loren  in an epic melodrama that takes place in Spain in 1810 during the Peninsular War, a military conflict between Napoleons empire and the allied powers of Britain, Spain, and Portugal. A giant cannon is abandoned by the retreating Spanish army and British naval officer and artillery expert Captain Anthony Trumbell (Grant) is ordered to retrieve it. He enlists the aid of guerrilla leader Miguel (Sinatra) and the cannon is raised from the bottom of a gorge and repaired. Miguel insists the cannon be used to bombard the French occupying the fortress at Avila. Trumbull reluctantly agrees to accompany Miguel and his peasant followers and fire the cannon once it reaches its destination.

During the long journey, Trumbull is attracted to Juana (Loren), Miguels girl, and a romantic triangle develops as the rebels lug the multi-ton cannon across rough terrain.

Sinatras Spanish accent is terrible and Loren speaks with a thick Italian accent. Grant, looking great in his military uniform, rises above the material and plays it perfectly straight. This is a good example of monumental miscasting. None of the leads comfortably or believably convince in their roles and were obviously hired for their name value at the box office. Despite their cumulative star power, the real star of the picture is that enormous cannon being dragged across the landscape.

There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release.",1473120000,,1546,5.164

8762239,5,B01G3MKOXQ,"What can be said, probably Cary Grant's finest performance and helped by two other greats, S. Loren and F. Sinatra. This was movie making at it's best.",1516665600,,151,4.62962962962963
8762240,3,B01G3MKOXQ,"Maybe this reminds me of El Cid because they are similar stories with Sophia Loren in both.

Based on a novel by C.S. Forester, a shoemaker (Frank Sinatra) and a misaligned woman who has a tendency to sleep with anyone (Sophia Loren) get their hands on a big gun. They are loaned a Captain from the English military (Cary Grant) to help point and shoot the gun at the bad guys. In this case the bad buys are French that occupy Spain. Through the movie the woman bounces back and forth between these two gentlemen each with his strengths and weakness.

C.S. Forester must have never been in the military as both sides in the conflict make the most stupid blunders. Come to think about it C.S. Forester must never have been in love and this mnage a trios make the most stupid blunders. Actually Forester did write a few good books as ""The African Queen,"" Not as good as the movie.

Mean time back at the ranch the bad guys (French occupiers) run around like a chicken with its head rung off. The good guys (Spanish) with the help of local peasants intend to blow up a fort held by the French.

Will they succeed or be cut off at the pass?

Can anyone help Frank Sinatra get over that horrible accent?",1499904000,,1198,4.354260089686099

8762242,4,B01G3MKOXQ,"Spectacular, but hilarious rendering of CS Forester's 'The Gun'. On the good side is a couple of well conceived battle sequences involving a Spanish attack on a French encampment, & a booby trapped bridge.
On the down side, Frank Sinatra is totally miscast, & so is Cary Grant. What Forester would have thought of this piece of Hollywood history, would probably be unprintable.
Sophia Loren is worth the ticket price alone. The Bluray transfer is excellent. All in all, an entertaining movie of biblical proportion nonsense.",1492992000,,524,5.104651162790698
