4667203,5,B005ESRNGC,"I have been watching this for months now, and I still haven't gotten to every disc in the set. There is so much great playing and subtlety that you can easily watch each show 7-8 times without even beginning to get bored.

This is mostly 1980s Miles, so it is a great combination of funk, jazz and pop. Not as innovative as the 1960s and 1970s Miles, perhaps, but the improvisation and chops are there. And Miles is still a one-of-a-kind band leader who can get the best performances out of his sidemen. I particularly recommend the Scofield/Berg/Jones era of Discs 2-5.

I'm sure I'll still be watching these regularly in a year and maybe even five years.",1332201600,8,656,4.5508474576271185
4667204,5,B005ESRNGC,"I am honored to be the first reviewer of this fine collection.

This 10 DVD set covers musical appearances that Miles Davis made at the Montreux Jazz Festival from 1973 until 1991.

When I saw that this became available, I begged my wife to get it for me for Christmas.  It's Christmas Day, and I'm watching.  I've been listening to some of these tracks since the ""Live Around the World"" CD came out in 1996.  The rest of the tracks were released on the limited edition ""The Complete Miles Davis At Montreux: 1973-1991"" boxed set in 2002.  It's now out of print and sells here on Amazon for $390.  If you're a fan of Miles' work from 1973 - 1991 you must add this to your collection.  There is something magical about being able to see Kenny Garrett, Bob Berg, Kei Akagi, Darryl Jones, Ricky Wellman, Robert Irving III, John Scofield, Foley McReary and other incredible musicians interacting, learning and growing with Miles.

Having heard all of these tracks before, I'll comment specifically about the quality of the package and the audio and video.

First of all, the audio is crystal clear in 2 track stereo.  DTS and 5.1 mixes are also available.  Unfortunately, I don't own a 5.1 or DTS rig so I can only guess that the audio quality is equally as good.  I have purchased several Eagle Vision jazz music videos in the past and I can attest to their meticulous attention to detail on all of their fine products.

Video Continuity/Synchronization is great. I'm guessing that this is probably why there has been a 5 year lag between the release date of the CD box set and the video collection.  Eagle Vision and Claude Nobs have taken their time making sure that the video matches the audio perfectly.

The liner notes are everything you'd expect in a $100+ package.  The notes are detailed and come packaged in a nice, glossy booklet.

For additional reviews of the audio, hop over to the reviews found on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Miles-Davis-At-Montreux-1973-1991/dp/B00006FDSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Miles Davis At Montreux: 1973-1991</a>&nbsp;product.  There are some differences between this package and the Miles at Montreux CD box set.  The following tracks are found on the Complete Miles at Montreux set but are not on this set.  I'm not sure if this is because the video was damaged/incomplete or if the video was not licensed for some reason:

Except for the missing '73 tracks, Katia, Amandla and Springsville there are alternate takes of the remaining missing tracks.  Disc 20 was recorded at a festival in Nice on Jul 19, 1991 and is not in this set.

This box set adds interviews with Herbie, Carlos Santana, Betty Carter, Monty Alexander and many more.

All in all, an extremely nice package for around $100 bucks.  10 DVDs, 10 separate concerts.  Countless hours of live performance.  Considering that the CD audio only will now set you back close to $400 now, the chance to get 3 different audio formats and video together makes this an incredible buy.  (Search the 'net, you can find the $100 deal pretty easily)

10+ stars.",1324771200,25,4814,4.903584672435105

8468996,5,B005ESRNGC,"I've been listening to Miles since 1964 when I first joined the CBS Australian Record Club, so I have grown up with Miles's many band incarnations and movements in music - the New Directions in Jazz, as some might recall. In later years I was able to see Miles live, in the 70s and the 80s (1988 being the last time).
Apart from the first disc on this magnificent set which captures one track from 1973, this documents several versions of Miles's bans at Montreux through the mid-80s to the l991 concert.
This means there is a degree of repetition in the pieces played, but  every version is different enough top warrant inclusion. Different sounds, different solos, different dynamics within the bands. These are extremely well-shot concerts, superbly edited and sounding just wonderful. Apart from the work with Gil Evans (and let's not forget the superb Aura) Miles big band dates were pretty scarce. But some of these groups from the 1980s, particularly those with Robbin Ford on guitar, create a big band wall of sound as the various players weave in and out the massive electronic keyboard arrangements. If you like Miles, then this is well worth a look and listen. If you love Miles, then it's a must-have. As another reviewer said, there's far too much to take in in just one viewing. It's music for the ages - raw and powerful, sweet and gentle by turns.",1370217600,3,1363,4.702928870292887
8468997,5,B005ESRNGC,"I bought the original audio CD set back when it was released but ending up selling it (but not before ripping it to my collection) and i am a little sorry I did. However, it is time for redemption. This is box set is the same collection but gives you the concert video. This bring everything so much more to life. Just listening is one thing and it is wonderful but to see how Miles played and how cool he really was on stage is a major treat. You can't go wrong in buying this set since as of this writing Amazon has reduced it to $99.99. Now this is a steal.
I have not seen all the discs yet but I know what to expect and that is top notch performing by Mile s and his band. The only thing this does not include is disc 20 from the audio CD release which is the July 17th concert with keyboardist Deron Johnson. No matter though this is worth more than what you will pay to see a master  musician play live.",1351900800,2,910,4.0
8468998,5,B005ESRNGC,"It's pricey,but worth it if you're a Miles fan. A lot of overlap of songs but that's to be expected. Wish there was more concerts with Robben Ford. Some really intense funky grooves going on here. Sound is quite good.",1338854400,2,217,4.45
