4326065,5,B004CCNB58,"I fell in love with the original Evangelion series and as a result i was skeptical of the rebuild movies, and i was right to be. For after viewing this amazing retake on the series I wanted nothing more than to drop my current life, learn japanese and go to Japan for the release of the next movie due to impatience. I found the movie to be just as gripping as it's predecessor and the animation to be even more so. A movie that I believe even non-fans will enjoy.",1295222400,13,464,4.166666666666667
4326066,5,B004CCNB58,"I'm writing this as the credits roll on the Blu-Ray, and I'm going to have to say, originally I kind of felt there wasn't a need for another version of the series, as the original was more or less THE definitive epic mecha anime, but where 1.11 You Are [Not] Alone kind of seemed like an HD rehashing of the original story (not that there's anything wrong with that), 2.22 You Can [Not] Advance knocks it out of the park...No spoilers, but I will say, fans and newbies alike will definitely be in for a treat watching the new theatrical versions in sequence, as my eyes and brain haven't felt that kind of punch from an anime since GITS 2.

BUY IT. Your brain will thank you. 'Nuff said.",1294704000,19,687,4.325581395348837
4326067,5,B004CCNB58,"This is an amazing film, hands down. Now about the Blu-Ray, Just a word to the wise Gainax released this all over Asia already, and there are two versions that exist, Japan's & Asia's. The Japan only version of the Blu-ray is a dual-layer Blu-Ray (50 gigs) all other versions thus far as I understand it are single layer (25 gig) OFFICIAL Blu-Rays. I wonder if America is gonna be ""Special"" and get the dual layer version or not. If your like me you will wait and find out before buying... but I already bought the Japanese Release.",1294617600,7,532,4.438775510204081
4326068,5,B004CCNB58,"Definitely not the official release for American audiences, but really really well done. It would not work in my DVD player, but my Apple PowerBook played it just fine; I have a large screen so it was not a big deal. English translation is a bit funny, but expected with this type of version. Just happy to not have to wait until the official version is released. If this version is available for the 3rd movie before American companies get their act together I will buy from them again!",1289174400,,487,4.48314606741573

4326070,5,B004CCNB58,"I think these movies are an improvement and refinement of the original series. The first movie, You Are (Not) Alone, really just mirrors the beginning of the series with much better graphics. The second movie, You Can (Not) Advance, is obviously adding to the story in significant ways.

I happen to love these movies and are superior to the series, which was not very well planned, but a great series despite it's lack of thoughtful execution. The brilliance of Evangelion is in its characters and in the psychological exploration of Shinji. In fact, I think Evangelion can be viewed as an archetypal dream and the dreamer is Shinji.

Much better than the series so far. I highly recommend it.

And, oh yea, this bootleg is of great quality.",1287705600,,742,4.78125
4326071,4,B004CCNB58,"The Film: Instead of taking the ""let's adapt the show to a two hour film"" approach of the first flick, the second film strays wildly from the show, improving and expanding upon an already legendary series.  There are moments in it when your jaw will drop, the animation, direction, and writing is so good.  Clearly they had more budget for this film and it's fantastic.  Each angel battle really feels like the end of the world, with an intensity and drama the best ones from the series contained.  This film is amazing!

The DVD: The picture is fine as is the sound; the subtitles aren't always perfect and are a bit small, but that's a minor complaint.  Until this is released in the US, it's surely worth the money.  (It gets 4 stars instead of five due to the subtitling.)",1283904000,6,776,4.5
4326072,3,B004CCNB58,"This doesn't appear to be an official release, and has all the hallmarks of a Chinese bootleg: Chinese (Mandarin) subs, grammatical errors in the English, cheap packaging.

As others have said, it may do until the real thing appears (and beats watching some fansub made with a camera in the 3rd row of a movie theater), but don't be fooled into thinking you're getting an official quality DVD.",1283558400,14,393,4.779411764705882
4326073,4,B004CCNB58,"Main reason I bought this DVD was the price (along with not feeling like waiting half a year for the Blu-Ray release...) It's an excellent value for the price. The subtitles are not perfect, as previously mentioned it is mainly just obvious tense issues, and there were a few line that seemed awkward, but it didn't really subtract much at all from the experience. The Visual and Audio quality is EXCELLENT on this release, better than Funimation's Evangelion 1.01 DVD release. It is actually very close in quality to Funimation's Evangelion 1.11 Blu-Ray release. I've added 15 pictures which cover the packaging, the menu system, and a few movie screens. If you liked Funimation's Evangelion 1.11 Blu-Ray Release, you will enjoy this Evangelion 2.22 DVD release. Very much worth the extremely low price, and will work very well until the Blu-Ray is finally released.

EDIT: I'll be knocking down the score one star being it's a bootleg. I ended up getting the official Region 3 DVD release for ~$19 and this reviewed release looks to be a direct copy of it. I'd recommend spending a little extra and going with the Region 3 version, or wait for the Blu-Ray. Or you can buy the Region A Blu-Ray with English Dub/Sub for $37... I can wait for Funimation's Blu-Ray release.",1283558400,2,1271,4.80365296803653
4326074,5,B004CCNB58,"Best deal for Evangelion 2.22 until FUNimation finishes an English dubbed version (they JUST got the rights to 2.22 a few weeks ago, I believe. Probably shouldn't expect it until next year).

On my order: The package came the earliest predicted date of arrival.

The fact that it comes in the Eco packaging makes it even better, as the cost for the product and shipping are minimal.

DVD quality is perfect, and the special features are something that's been keeping me busy for the past few days: deleted scenes and the ""2.02"" making-of montage, showing how almost every scene was animated from the storyboard and beyond.

Of course, the official English subtitles are a blessing (no more fan subs). A few grammatical errors are present, but they only involve tenses, are are very easy to ignore if you're used to reading subtitles quickly. Listening to the Cantonese dubbing is also fun, just because I don't hear Chinese dubs of things all that often.

Overall, I give my prayers and good wishes to those who published and sold this copy of Evangelion 2.22. I don't think I could go another WEEK without seeing this film in its entirety ^_^",1282867200,,1143,4.752525252525253

4326107,3,B004CCNB58,"So I'm a reasonably big fan of the original series after seeing it for the first time three years ago. And I'll preface this all by saying I'm generally no big fan of anime, so I've been unsure of what to expect from these ""reboot""/""reinterpretation"" Evangelion films. But so far I've tried to keep an open mind through my viewings of the first two they've released.

When I heard that NGE was in the midst of this lengthy re-do, I figured that this could be a great opportunity to polish the show's message which is very murky unless you devote yourself to attempting to understanding the film's symbolism--something which could take a great deal of time beyond the show's running time. And I would come to slightly resent that as I have several friends who aren't averse to, but generally do not like, anime that I knew would be turned off by the convoluted and confusing nature of NGE. Maybe a concise reboot was exactly what we need to show the genius of NGE to a broader audience!

Unfortunately, a great deal of these rebuild movies takes the show in the exact opposite direction.

It seems to me that, while the visuals are mostly great and the world feels more fleshed out (again on a mostly visual level), all they've really done is remove tons of necessary character development, toned the characters' personalities way down, and there seems to be way less explanation of what's going on. The creators here seem to expect every viewer to have a functioning memory of those details from the original series as the films often feel like a remastered Fast Forward through the major plot points of the series. I certainly won't be showing my anime-phobic friends these NGE rebuild movies any time soon. They seem to work better as a playful take on nostalgia or even as a kind of very professional fan-fiction. In any case, the removal of some very necessary parts of the show's narrative (i.e. no shocking reveal about the EVAs being living creatures, instead relying on imagery alone to imply this), and the preservation and addition of eye-rolling fan service shots? Did we really need to see that many shots of Asuka naked? ..Or even the new character Mari? So far, I can only imagine she exists for fan service purposes. I suppose I wouldn't care as much as the movies, much like the series, have a very dark tone which requires some levity. But why does that come in form of lingering, creepy direction of some of the characters? These parts don't even help with character development, and the time could certainly be better spent giving us some more of the series' narrative substance.

Anyhow, I can't say I hated it but these films are never going to replace the series any time soon. I will probably continue on to the third installment as it'll at least be 100% new territory for the franchise, but I won't hold my breath for a masterpiece that in any way compares to the relative coherence of the series.

Better luck on the next reboot, Anno. At least your Godzilla movie was damn-near perfect!",1481328000,,3013,4.656015037593985

4326127,5,B004CCNB58,"Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance may just be one of my favorite films of all time. After watching It I felt like I needed a nap, the Intensity of everything from beginning to end was just an experience I wasn't ready for! Everything the first film did was outdone by the 2nd, drama, action, animation.. It was all there In a near 2 hour package of pure bliss. The stakes were higher, the action was high octane resulting In third degree burns from fight one to the last, very rarely am I ever so In tune with characters In an animated film, but Evangelion broke that barrier with It's middle and ending acts.

First off, Animation : The animation was simply a thing of beauty, the attention to new details In this film was so spot on that I felt like I was there! Seeing the workings of Tokyo III was engaging and awe-inspiring! The Eva x Angel fights In this film was like clock-work.. textbook perfection!

Sound : The film seemed to opt for some Godzilla sound-bites
with the first angel's screams being reminiscent of Megaguirus and Misato Katsuragi's ringtone was King Ghidorah's roar, seems Hideaki Anno had an eye for Gojira long before the plans of Shin-Gojira. Again the sounds of Evas and Angels were fantastic and let off a more animalistic side of the Evas while the Angels were kept at a rather unsettling edge.

Story : The story was heartbreaking, there was loss, blooming love, betrayal & then some. It was hard to watch a few scenes In both the action segments and non action segments, they hit really close to heart and.. honestly It was beautiful.

Characters : I fell In love Rei and Shinji In this film. They both seemed to crack a bit out of their shells and what lead to the ending of the film had me In tears and yelling at the screen ""GO GET 'EM SHINJI"" I was completely Into the scenes with the two and It left quite the Impression. Of corse we were Introduced to a few new characters as well, such as Asuka Langley Shikinami the hot headed captain Eva pilot which the movie opens up with, she kicks some.. well ALL THE ASS and set the opening of the movie up PERFECTLY. Like to a damn T PERFECTLY. While her character did get under my skin a few times, seeing her evolve under the short amount of time was enjoyable! More so with her than your average ""tough as nails"" characters & the mysterious Mari Illustrious Makinami who came In out of nowhere! This character, she's Interesting to say the least! And what she was able to do with her Eva (at least before Shinji's final act) was baffling and left me speechless, Mari has guts and the potential to really carry a series all her own.

Over-all : I'm keeping these reviews spoiler free, but leaving enough In them to get those who've yet to watch these films to make the attempt with them! I've honestly found a top 10 favorite movie by my sheer curiosity and holy hell do I mean that.. holy hell does It mean something. It takes a lot for me to like a movie, but to LOVE a movie.. this film managed to get me to that point at the 40 minute mark, both through characters and the action Implemented. Plus It helps that Utada came back yet again to give us the Acoustic Mix of Beautiful World which only added to the tears after the film's end. Evangelion 2.0 Is currently my favorite anime film of all time, yes before AKIRA & ALL of Ghibli's films.. this one just took the cake and ate It too. I can't help but sing It's praises.

Rating : 5/5
Recommendation : Highest I could ever possibly stress. Watch these movies. You will NOT regret It.",1466035200,2,3527,4.385321100917431

I love that this film went into more detail about what happened during the test activation of unit 3. This can be almost directly transferred to the original series as the original went into very little detail.  Mari definitely made way for several plot departures from the original story. I only dock one star because I felt the immediate aftermath of the Partial 3rd Impact was whole sale ignored between 2.22 and 3.33. 14 years pass between films and there is little to no mention of what the cast experiences between films save for some hints given in 3.33's intro. Like for instance how Misato's new counter-NERV group came about and how they took control of unit 01. How did the WUNDER get built? What was it's original purpose? I'd love to eventually see a Rebuild 2.5 film to fill in this rather sizeable gap and answer those questions.",1458518400,,1077,4.638743455497382

4326160,5,B004CCNB58,"This movie has easily been added to my favorite movies list. Dont be thrown off by the anime look; this is japanese film at its finest.

I rented the 1.11 from my local library ( shout out to the  maplewood public library in rochester)  and fell in love with the series. 2.22 carries over all of the elements from the first movie that made it so good. The artwork and design is beautiful and the voice acting is amazing. The action scenes put you on the edge of your seat with intense fights. Evangelion 2.22 is another example of why i love Japanese films. The subtle storytelling doesnt just throw everything at you like most american films today. Some thought is required but you won't get any feelings of being completely left in the dark. The mix of drama and action is perfectly spaced.

The last 30 minutes or so of the movie is extremely intense and ends with a cliff hanger that will make you crave the 3rd installment. This is the only downfall because 3.33 appears to have fallen off the edge of the earth. I have spent much time trying to find out when it will be coming out but have found nothing solid; even the funimation website is scarce on details.

Buy this as well as 1.11 and join the many other fans who are praying for the release of 3.33",1435968000,3,1261,4.348936170212766

When I bought this movie, I was expecting something like 1.11 (which I thought was good), and to my surprise, it took everything from the previous one and made it better, it's faster paced than 1.11 (not saying 1.11 was slow). The action is just way to epic to put into words, the cinematography was great and the music added to the fight, it fit perfectly. The animation also improves from the previous title. The movie,  is about 10 to 12 minutes longer than 1.11 with about 40 minutes of extra features. The extra features include U.S cast commentary Japanese original trailer, train channel spot, dvd and Blu-Ray Spots, omitted scenes, remixed scene and some trailers. Overall, I really recommend it to people who like anime and specially to those that enjoyed 1.11.

4326248,4,B004CCNB58,"Very good movie for old time Evangelion fans who are looking for a well done remake of the original Neon Genesis: Evangelion. Although not touching upon many of the parts from the old series, (Which is quite disheartening) and switching up some of the Angels and their names, the movie does do very well in developing the characters themselves. Rather then seeing Shinji Ikari as some whinny brat like in the first movie, he becomes more stable and confident in what he does, which really shows how as the movie series goes on he is steadily maturing. Along with the character development revamp in the movies, the creators have managed to replicate most of the original anime scenes into three dimensional renditions. This in itself proves greatly appealing for those Eva fans who've always wanted to see the Evas and Angels really stand out as prominent figures in the show. Now to continue with the new effects and animating, Evangelion 2.22 does not disappoint in comparison to other mecha movies and anime of this time. Matching their quality and flow for the most part and sometimes even surpassing others. This is not to say that the movie is not without faults though for even with the amazing graphics and scenes, some of the scenes where characters are communicating are a bit choppy. Also, on another note, this movie far from a children's movie. While not standing up next to Berserk or anything, the movie does have some images that may not be appropriate for younger viewers. I'd recommend keeping this movie to older teens at the very least since besides the imagery, the overall plot and storyline of the movie is hard to grasp for younger people.

Overall I'd give this movie a 4 out of 5 for it being a very well done remake.",1393804800,,1743,4.714754098360656
4326249,5,B004CCNB58,"I won't say much about the plot of the movie because it has been detailed here in the two hundred plus reviews, but as they have stated, it is intense, fantastic and you should pick this movie up and the first one, even if you don't like anime or animation, or just want to see what the medium is capable of. There is some nudity, but I assume you people are mature and won't have an aneurism over it. Besides, there isn't much.

On the art and animation front; the scenes and characters are well drawn and consistent, with the animation and movement of the characters and sets being fluid and smooth. I didn't find any one part of the film that seemed lower quality than another. The designs for the Evangellion (the giant robots) are by my standards, cool and interesting to look at.

I am going to preface the part about the voice acting by saying I am one of those people who generally prefer subs to dubs, and this movie is no exception. By no means is the dub for this movie ""bad"" by any stretch of the imagination (it' won't make your ears bleed), I just think that the original voice cast with subtitles is the superior version.

Honestly if you like a good story, don't mind some minor nudity, and are willing to give something that is animated rather than live action a chance, Evangellion is the movie for you. Take the plunge, you won't regret it.

The DVD also comes with a pamphlet that details key terms (such as what an AT field is and what the Second Impact was) as well as slight character background. included also is the design process behind the characters, Evangellions, and angels. All in all, it's a cool little extra that will help you get a basic understanding if you are new to the franchise.

(Please note that this is the second movie in the Evangelion series and preceded by ""Evangellion 1.11: You Are (Not) Alone), but if you read a synopsis of the first one it will make sense. Well, as much sense as ""Evangellion"" can be said to make)

4326257,5,B004CCNB58,"Wow...it's been ages since I last wrote a review.

Upon hearing that there was gonna be a new Evangelion movie series, I thought it was pointless for Gainax to do something like that, as the story has already been told, and if I ever wanted to see Evangelion again, I'd refer back to my old Platinum DVD Collection I bought years ago. And at that point, I was already over Evangelion, as I have moved on to better anime, and started watching the classics that I see myself watching over and over again. Boy was I wrong, or what? Turns out these movies are an alternate retelling of the Evangelion story, and I have to say, I'm very impressed. The 2nd movie in the series, ""You Can (Not) Advance"" became my personal favorite in the series. It's not just a good movie in the series, it's a good sci-fi anime film period, well...at least in my opinion anyway.

I won't give many spoilers away. But all I can say is that some of the characters were a lot better than they were in the series. More notably, Shinji Ikari whom I consider to be one of the worst characters in the Evangelion story. But in this movie, he surprised and impressed the heck out of me. There is also a new character named Mari Makinami Ilustrious, who is known as the Fourth Child. Personally, I think she's one of the coolest characters in the movie, and her presence, though somewhat limited, livens this already great movie. The story overall is accessible even to non fans of the series, meaning the characters and plot are rather easy to follow this time around, and it's very entertaining. The fates of the original characters have been altered for better or worse, so it's definitely not the same as the original series' continuity. The visuals are also very superb and vibrant. From the lighting, CG Eva units, character animations, special effects, just to name a few, it's a treat for the eyes! The soundtrack used for the movie is amazing too! The music used for this movie really matched the overall mood and atmosphere. The ending theme ""Please Give Me Wings"" by Megumi Hayashibara really stood out for me, as it was an emotionally moving song.

When I reviewed the Evangelion Platinum Collection DVD set, I have to admit that I sounded like a total elitist jerk when bashing on the English dub. I feel somewhat the same about the dub. But it's not really as bad as I originally thought. The English dub has its moments of sounding good in the original series. But still, Japanese language with subs are preferred on that one. And what of the English dub of You Can (Not) Advance? I really enjoyed the dub as much as I do the original Japanese version! Three of the original American voice cast make a return, such as Spike Spencer as Shinji Ikari, Alison Keith as Misato Katsuragi and Tiffany Grant as Asuka Langley Shikinami (originally ""Soryu"" in the TV series). Sadly those are the only ones that returned to reprise their roles. However, the new voices for the rest of the characters like Greg Ayres as Kensuke Aida, Justin Cook as Toji Suzuhara, Brina Palencia as Rei Ayanami, J. Michael Tatum as Ryoji Kaji, Colleen Clinkenbeard as Ritsuko Akagi, again to name a few, sound just as good if not better than the original actors that played as them. As for the original Japanese cast, it's also great to hear them reprise their roles once more.

Overall, I cannot recommend this movie enough. Whether or not you're an Evangelion fan, or are just getting into the series, these Rebuild movies are a good start. The stories are accessible and the characters have a little more depth than they did in the original series. You Can (Not) Advance is definitely a movie you can't ignore. Definitely a worthy addition to any anime fan's Blu-Ray and DVD collection. Though I recommend the Blu-Ray!",1391731200,,3775,4.613095238095238

But there are many changes here and the story takes a different direction at some point; the main plot points of the series are well respected here but hardcore fans of the original NGE might not be as happy as me with the new pace.

To those that don't know Evangelion: this is not for those with strict religious beliefs and are easily offended, this is not for children, this is violent and has a lot of adult content.

Also a warning to the fans, I hated the third movie and think this reboot is only good until Evangelion 2.22 (although I haven't watched the 4th movie yet so this might change if I think it is worth watching until the end).",1390348800,,899,4.345238095238095

 - Amazing animation
 - Brilliant art direction
 - Great voice acting
 - Beautiful soundtrack

Cons:
 - Story isn't as well thought out as 1.0
 - Story kinda snubs Asuka (my favorite character from the original series)
 - What is up with the see through plug suits?

When I saw 1.0, I was stunned. It was brilliant, amazing, emotional, and best of all: you could 'get it' without being a philosophy major. The in depth symbolism was still there layered over a story that would still make sense to normal people. 1.0 primarily focused on building the relationship between Shinji and Rei and it was wonderful, it made their peril and willingness to sacrifice all for each other all the more emotional at the end (I actually thought it did a better job building the relationship than the series did).

I expected that 2.0 would give Asuka the same treatment, but then there's this... other woman... on the cover. The end result is that there was no real development of the characters. Shinji never really builds a relationship with Asuka or ""what's her name that's on the cover"". And to make it worse, if you have never seen the original show, the existence of Asuka's character in this movie really has no purpose and adds nothing to the story at all. Yet still, rather than delaying Asuka's introduction until the next movie (which would have made sense), they force her to compete for screen time with the new girl, ""what's her name that's on the cover, I can't be bothered to look it up"", and neither gets any sort of real character development. So by the end of the movie, Shinji still has no real attachments to any of the other characters except Rei and Misato. But they try to force it and pretend that the ending is emotional, when I really didn't feel anything because there was no emotional bond developed. The only way you can reasonably feel for Asuka's plight in this movie, is if you already know the character from the series.",1389312000,2,1945,4.611594202898551

The story started off with an epic fight scene between a giant Angel (monster) and an Evangelion piloted by a new character.  After the scene, the film basically picks up the main series Evangelion after where Asuka was introduced.  One difference though: this was incredibly dark, and was an absolute feast for the eyes.

My only complaint comes with the disc itself.  I only cared about disc one, a.k.a the one with the movie on it, which had a giant line going down it.  It caused massive glitches, and I could barely watch my favorite scenes from Toonami's airing of it.  However, this is expected, since the discs were apparently made in Mexico, and distributed from Kansas City. (The past sentence was intended for purpose of comedy, not to offend anybody.)

The blu ray was not wrapped, It was opened, the bottom of the case was broken, the booklet had finger creases, the disc had dust on the back. And the case itself was scratched and foggy like used items. Im very dissapointed with the delivery of this item and the fact I got a used copy for the full price of a promised new copy.

4326324,5,B004CCNB58,"Sorry if this review seems thin, trying my best to avoid spoilers!

After Eva 1.11 you were probably expecting that 2.22 and 3.33 would be fairly in line with the original series. They aren't. The plot starts to diverge from the Evangelion universe we knew and loved and starts to become something different, kinda like a relative or friend we knew years ago who has grown up and is now a different person. That being said, some of the scenes sent shivers down my spine, so many of the possibilities for the original series that never became due to time or money are now portrayed in full form. This was not a low budget thrown together project.

If you never saw the original series, expect for all of the characters to have their own agendas, often conflicting. Never believe anything you are told, because everyone is lying to everyone else, and sometimes themselves. Just buckle up and enjoy the wonderful ride!

If you saw the original series, expect to have a slight leg up when watching 2.22. You already know some of the secrets, and you already know that everyone is lying! Just try to treat it as a separate work or you will end up with a book vs movie kind of internal conflict.

Oh and 3.33 gets even better!",1371513600,,1220,4.506787330316742

What I most like it about is the main concept of the series.

I didn't even know that Hideaki Anno had remade the story until recently. Seeing any production the way the creator truly envisions it is always a plus, and 1.11 and 2.22 do not disappoint. 2.22 Picks up fast where 1.11 left off and I like the new character (Mari) and can't wait to see where the story goes in 3.33. Just wish we didn't have to wait for the next two...I still love the original series and End of Evangelion, but I am enjoying the new and different twists just as much.

I'm still a newbie to the series, and I thought that the earlier 1.11 version was kinda dragging in the story development. The infusion of CGI and traditional mecha-anime animation look awesome in both versions.

4326365,3,B004CCNB58,"While Evagelion 1.11 was a good condensation of the traditional story arc,  Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance is caught in a problem with too many characters and too much plot being covered in too little time.

Character development suffered as a result and, since this is at the core of the appeal of this story for me it left me feeling let down. Auska suffered worst as she was barely introduced before she was being pushed out. It's not just her though. Mari, a new character who barely appeared in 1.11 is not filled in and is still an enigma as the story starts it's terminal phase. Ryoji Kaji, Auska and Misato Katsuragi's love interest is reduced to just another bit character.

I can't cover it all because it's too much but so many characters were introduced and than 'fast forwarded' over that my only reaction could best be described in anime style as ........ or maybe ""Huh?!"", are they serious?

As positive as I was on 1.11, 2.22 left me thinking that this release of Evangelion was badly botched. I'm wondering if they can recover in 3.33 and if I even want to bother finding out.",1357776000,3,1101,4.545454545454546

There are more evident and profound changes in this second part than there were in the first one in relation to the classic, which might make some hardcore fans uncomfortable, but now you can start to glimpse where the story is heading too, differently from the original, which had a strange ending (although the series was still superb).

From a technical perspective, this movies continues the video and audio wonder of 1.11. The recreated angels are awesome and the whole film is crystal clear and jaw dropping. The addition of CGI to the traditional animation does no detract from the film and makes it more beautiful, in contrast to the blu-ray edition of Ghost in the Shell, which had the first opening sequence remade in CGI in a way that did not blend in very well to the original animation.

This is the Star Wars of Japan, and truly deserves an equal footing of international recognition. If you haven't watched Eva yet, it's time to start. While watching the TV series (and 1990s movies) is strongly recommended, it's far from essential.

Well 5 years later, they make Evangelion 1.0 (or 1.11 for those who watch blu-ray).  I was kind of skeptical of it at first, but being the fan I am, watched it.  I ended up loving 1.11 and buying it to put in my special collection.  Of course I couldn't wait to see 2.22.  Well, I can say I was not disappointed at all.

Evangelion 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance is a masterpiece.  Easily the best movie I have seen all year, even better than The Dark Knight Rises.  I'm just ashamed it took me this long to watch it.  If you enjoyed 1.11, then you will absolutely adore this one.  This movie introduces some new characters, and starts molding the story away from the original anime, and does an amazing job at doing it.  I thought the first one had some sweet scenes, this movie has straight up epic scenes.  The animation is does extremely nicely, the story is paced perfectly, and the action scenes have you on the edge of your seat through out the entire movie.

A lot more action a lot cooler battle. 2.22 is much better then 1.11 because its action nature. 1.11 setup the story up for 2.22. The only down side I can think of is that some angel battle are on the short side, but never the less it is still very cool.

4326386,5,B004CCNB58,"Neon Genesis Evangelion was originally a 26 episode anime series.  The story is now being retold in four ""Rebuild"" movies, of which this is the second.  The third should be releaed in Japan later in 2012.  The quality of animation improved incredibly from the TV series to 1.11, and has improved even more in this film.  Other differences: on the one hand, there's more humor and light-heartedness in some scenes, but on the other hand there are a couple of pretty brutal fight scenes between Evas and Angels.  In the first of these, the background music is this gentle song, sung by a child, which creates an extremely creepy effect.

The battle between humans and the Angels continues.  Two new Eva pilots are introduced: Asuka, familiar to viewers of the TV series, and Mari, a completely new character.  Askua fans may be upset with Mari stealing her screen time, and we don't have much of an idea of who Mari is and what she's up to, but I say give her a chance.

You definitely need to see Evangelion 1.11 before seeing this movie, but you don't really need to be familiar with the original TV series to understand this one.  The first film stuck fairly close to episodes 1-6 of the series.  In a way, this new movie takes us up to episode 19 of the original series.  In another way, it jumps up and down on episode 19 until there's nothing left but teeny tiny pieces.  And this is a good thing.  This movie completely changes the relationship between Rei and Shinji, and thus the next two movies might be completely unrecognizable from what has gone before.  Could we even be heading towards...a happy ending?

Bluray features

4326387,5,B004CCNB58,"Evangelion 1.11 followed the original TV series ep1-6 with hardly any changes, 2.22 roughly follows ep8-19, but there are so many changes that it would be difficult to list them all! Here are just a few of those changes: Shinji has way less self-hatred, Asuka is more introverted instead of being that loud-mouthed b****(that I loved...), and Rei actually seems human and is more than able to start a conversation! There's also a new sexy female pilot who at the moment seems to serve no purpose except to increase the sale of Eva merchandise...

That said, the best thing about 2.22 is the awe-inspiring visuals and the incredible new soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu, the combination make up for some of the most incredible battle scenes in any movie ever, you have to see and hear it to believe it.

The film ends in such a way that your guess is as good as mine as to what's going to happen in the next installment, actually there's a teaser trailer showing Asuka in space... Evangelion 3.33 is scheduled for release in Japan this fall, which means it will be a lonnnnnggggg wait before we can purchase the DVD in the states.

Here's a list of everything you get with this DVD purchase:

-A 16 page booklet which includes official artwork, character profiles, etc.
-US cast commentary, quite entertaining for those who enjoyed the dub (me)
-A short making of feature ""Rebuild of Evangelion 2.02"" which shows a bit of the animation process, there is no dialogue.
-Previews, TV spots, and trailers
-4 Omitted scenes in storyboard format
-remixed scene, ""Tsubasa wo Kudasai""
-English and Japanese audio and subs

4326389,5,B004CCNB58,"Neon Genesis Evangelion, although a flawed series originally, is considered one of the best animes ever made. Known for it's set of psychologically scarred characters, horror scenes, it's countless amount of religious symbolism, and one of the most disturbing and mind flexing endings ever, revolutionized the world of anime. The rebuild movies have completely rebooted the Evangelion trilogy, fixing countless flaws, making them some of the bets looking pieces of animation ever produced. The rebuild movies manage surpass the original flawed series in every way imaginable. They added so much to the original series, that makes the movies superior to the classic series. An example is the amount of depth added to the characters, especially Shinji, who is known as the biggest whiner in anime history. Surprisingly enough at the climax he actually gets some guts and actually fights for something HE wants, something that he never did in the original.  They even added a new mysterious character that's actually ""normally"" crazy, compared to the classic characters in the show who are traumatically scarred crazy. The visuals, oh boy, this movie is by far is the BEST looking anime feature film to EVER be produced. So many scenes stand out with crisp visual effects, from the evas running against time to defeat an angel, to the dramatic fights, everything looks spectacular in the remakes. This is Anno's original vision of Evangelion, this is what he wanted it to be from the start, but could not accomplish back then due to a low budget and the poor technology at the time. This is the TRUE Evangelion and I cannot wait to see where the ending will lead us.",1326412800,,1663,5.003610108303249

I have seen this over and over again I was attempting to figure out what the hype was all about and Well in my Opnion (IMO) They should not have ""Remade"" This series.  The orginal you have to take alot in it had some great action and awesome grapgics for its time, The orginal story jumped around alot and it seemed that the ending was done to quickly, the orginal did not take ""IMO"" enough time to explain the main Charaters and made them either realy Winny, Exstreamly tempermental or Emotionaly blank...The orginal I would of given 3 perhaps 4 stars b/c even with some of the flaws you still had a awesome Scf-fi anime but in all that was the Orginal series.

However this is a remake of the orginal series and I do see that they cut alot out to add some eye candy to this generation of Anime viewers. Personaly I think they did a poor job of it and should not of messed with something that had flaws to begin with.

But on a side note it's still a Sci-fi anime with loads of action but b/c of the cuts and the trimming they made I do think they made it much much worse."" Is what I posted on 1.11 and found it also relevent here.

4326396,5,B004CCNB58,"As a consumer recently rediscovering a love for anime - I recently picked up Evangelion 1.11 and 2.22 as well as the Platinum series collection. I can't stand most of the mainstream popular 'toons, they seem shallow and headache inducing.

This is the sequel to Evangelion: 1.11, which follows the plot of the original series quite closely.

2.22 is second installment in the new series. It is the ""break"" of the Japanese ""prelude/break/quick"" dramatic style the creators are utilizing to refresh the classic cartoon. Whereas Evangelion: 1.11 was the ""prelude"" and followed the first third of the TV series almost exactly, the ""break"" is where the adventure takes on a life of its own, derailing from the original story. All of this is explained in greater detail in the cool packet included with the DVD.

And believe you me, it does justice to the depth and entertainment factor of the original series. The animation is leaps and bounds beyond what Hideaki Anno & co. could have hoped to achieve in 1995. On Blu-Ray, it is stunning. The angel design and Eva animation are beyond cool.

If what 2.22 accomplishes on behalf of 1.11 is any indication of what the 3rd and 4th installments will deliver, fans should brace themselves.

Kudos to Anno and his new team for this gem!",1320796800,,1276,4.808219178082192

The retelling of this amazing story truly accelerates from where Evangelion: 1.11 left off",1320364800,,343,5.107142857142857

4326399,4,B004CCNB58,"Whenever I see a movie get too much praise, I have a tendency to hate it just because of such--not true for Evangelion 2.22. While the series has been synonymous with the terms ""overrated"" and ""pretentious"" at times, that's not to say that such things are completely true. Partially, maybe, but not completely.

I first watched the movie subbed (and in not the best of quality), having to sort through all the technobabble I was reading from the subtitles and piece together a story, resulting in not the best of experiences for me. That said, watching it dubbed made things significantly easier to follow on my part. Though, at the end of the day, both versions are essentially the same, the dub keeping as close to the original Japanese script as possible, while taking some liberties here and there for the sake of better expressing the characters for English-speaking audiences (ie: expressing Mari's character through stronger swears).

As for the story itself, I am glad that things are finally stemming away from the original 26-episode series. The problem I had with the first ""Rebuild"" movie was how close it stuck to the scenes in the original anime, while keeping the pacing rather slow, especially during the sluggish buildup to the climax. This time around, we get a good mix of old material and new material, keeping oldentime fans as well as newbies on their toes as to just exactly what will happen next.

And if the movie itself wasn't enough, the special features will definitely warrant the buy. Not only is there an audio commentary for the movie, but original Japanese trailers for the movie and DVD release, deleted scenes, and additional behind the scenes work, showing scenes as the make it from the drawing board to animated form. One minor complaint would be the inclusion of a ""play all"" option for the trailers, but not for other features, such as the deleted scenes. Being sent back to the main menu after 2 or so minutes only to select another 2 minute clip can be a pain after a while.

The picture quality is also excellent--one of the few animated movies that deserves to be seen in high definition, what with its mix of 3D-style animation alongside detailed 2D backgrounds. Definitely worth the purchase!",1316217600,,2238,4.8203125
4326400,5,B004CCNB58,"I am a long time Evangelion fan and this movie just blew my mind away.  The anime was brought up to date with new awasome 3D animations and the 2d animations were refined so that it almost brings the characters to life.  There were some changes to the original plot but in a very cool way it was given a fresh perspective without loosing much of the original content.  Definitely a must see to all Eva and anime fans in general.  Can't wait to the realese of the ramaining films, too bad we're goning to have to wati a couple of years",1315699200,,534,4.205882352941177
4326401,5,B004CCNB58,"2.22 is part 2 of the ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" and it is where there are some notable differences in the story compared to the original series. Notably adding the well-received character of Mari, and changing the pilot of unit 3.

As far as Blu-ray vs. DVD, I haven' seen 2.22 on dvd, but the Blu-ray compared to the series (watched Platinum Perfect collection) the visuals on 2.22 are far improved.

The only con to the product is that it will be a while before the last part is released in English (it hasn't had a theatrical debut in Japan as a Sept. 5 2011, and it will take time to translate and voice act.

So far I like this version better than the original. It's not as depressing, and it's a lot more exciting. Shinji has really manned-up. Rei has other emotions besides ""robot."" Gendo isn't a complete sociopath. I feel I can actually follow the storyline. I just love this remake! I like the changes to the story. I like the characters better.

4326412,5,B004CCNB58,"Most times, movie studios choose to make sequels because they either want to make a quick cash-in based on the popularity of a film franchise or continue the story the first installment established. Evangelion 2.22 is both yet it does not feel like a cheap quick-buck film nor does it feel rushed in regards to the pacing in its' story. The sequel expands on what the first film covered and continues to do so. To keep this review spoiler-free, I'll just explain what's already been known. We are introduced to new characters, specifically Mari Makinami, who you see at the very beginning of the film taking on one of the Angels, term given to alien beings that descend from space, in one of the most exciting and well-executed battles in the film. The second ""new"" character is Asuka Shikinami, who we see battle an angel around the first 15 minutes of the film. Like in the original series, Asuka sees herself as superior to Shinji and Rei concerning piloting an Eva and things don't start too well when they are first introduced. Meanwhile, Gendo Ikari, Shinji's father, is still just as secretive as he was in the series and in the last film but as we progress into the film, more details surface concerning what he has planned for Nerv headquarters and to the world population. The film loosely covers episodes 8-19 of the original series. Old fans will notice several references and changes to the story around the first hour but the film then takes a very wild and unique direction near the final 15 minutes. Believe me when I say this, you'll be eager to know what happens next and wonder how the director and producers will be able to top this. Take note that the film does not have an MPAA rating like the first film did. Evangelion 1.11 was released with a PG-13 rating; this was released unrated so I'll list what you need to watch for if kids younger than 15 are watching. Concerning content, this film is very violent and the battles between the Evas and the Angels can get quite bloody especially the fight between Eva unit-01 and Eva unit-03. There is some profanity, some of it is audible and some is covered with sound effects. There is [only] one audible F word at the very beginning of the film, before the movie title shows up. There is no sex whatsoever in the film but there are a few scenes with little nudity but it is not presented in a sexual manner. There are thematic elements throughout the film, focused mostly on Shinji's distant relationship with his father, Asuka's social detachment from people, and Rei's attempts to reach Shinji in a emotional method. Overall, this was an excellent film that will attract even non-fans of the series and individuals who are even remotely interested in anime. And blu-ray is the way to go! Highly recommended!",1314144000,4,2779,4.650406504065041
4326413,3,B004CCNB58,"I began watching the Rebuild of Evangelion films right after watching the anime and End of Evangelion, so I can spot a lot of the differences made much easier than most.  The first film was great, and easily compacted a lot of the beginning episodes into one neat feature film.  The second film, however, takes a huge departure from the canon; but rather than omitting the plot line altogether, it ""rebuilds"" it and keeps the general ideas, but changes a lot of the tinier details.

*SPOILERS*
For instance, we have the new character Mari ""Illustrious.""  She's no where to be found in the anime, and replaces some of Asuka's role.  Asuka, in turn, replaces Toji's greatest role.
The end of the film takes the End of Evangelion and incorporates it with the middle of the anime, so now audiences are wondering where the last two Rebuild films will take us.  We have Kaworu piloting his own Eva, and since 2.22 rushed through to the End of Evangelion, the last two films have to be a major retelling, or either completely new.
*SPOILERS END*

It's an interesting take, but I was left sort of disappointed that they rushed a lot of the show.  Then again, I don't know what the last two films will bring, so all we can do at this point is sit and wait.",1313712000,3,1247,4.486725663716814

4326416,4,B004CCNB58,"Well that was a surprise, after the first movie, no one knew what to expect from Rebuild of Evangelion 2.22 You can(not)Advance , Also known Evangelion New Theatrical Edition Break, With the first movie being a shot for shot remake of episodes 1-6 of the TV series, people were disappointing that Hideaki Anno gave us the finger, again, and suckered our money, again. So colored me shocked that this new movie blew almost everyone away, if at least for the fact that the last one was so disappointing.
  Eva 1.11 was a straight up remake of the beginning of the TV show, but Eva 2.22 is a spiritual remake of episodes 7-24 and the movie, End of Evangelion, it breaks off from the TV series in a multitude of ways, characters personalities are slightly adjusted, the angels aren't named anymore, and there are new characters and themes. For good or bad or cynic, Eva 2.22 manages to step out of its legacy by whatever means possible(I mean, whoever makes a Quadrilogy?) For instance the new character, Mari. Mari is the Pooche to Ichi & Scratchy, she is cool, she is focus tested, and she takes things TO THE EXTREME  but, like Poochie, she is VERY SHALLOW; Mari has 3 scenes in the movie, and she has very little importance in each of them, you could literally edit her out of the movie and have it still be a cohesive movie; it was a bad marketing move on the PR team to bold, underline, and highlight her presence in the movie but maybe considering what happens at the end of the movie, Mari will have more time to shine in the next movie, but until then, she is just another cynical attempt to milk this franchise.
  But even with all this, Eva 2.22 is breathtaking, every battle is a duel to the death, the animation is amazing, and the choice of music is haunting. The symbolism has also been improved, they are leaning much less on the shallow Christianity and Jewish Kabbalah symbolism and more on characters and politics, and, this will be a decisive point between critics, the TV series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, many parts of this movie call back to certain scenes in the TV show and in some cases build on them, leading to wild speculation by fans, some might say that this defeats the point of this Quadrilogy's agenda to introduce new fans to Eva, but in my mind it doesn't. While your enjoyment of this movie will increase or decrease greatly if you seen the original TV series, it still all fits within the context of these movies.
  While the past 2 movies lie in the originals shadow, if they creators of this movie can keep this up, this series will end up as the stronger work, But since they re-imagined the whole TV show, they have to make up whole new stuff from this point on, and that will be the true test; but Rebuild of Evangelion 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance earns its name in every respect of the word.

The Japanese dub comes ONLY FROM THE LEFT SPEAKER, while

It really feels sick that you hear all the conversations only from one of your sides....

Otherwise, probably thanks to the original Japanese blu-ray production, the sound effect, music and all other sound components are just perfect.
I imagine that Funimation is responsible for this most horrible possibly imaginable decision of monaural dubbing.

However, if I had not already watched the original series, I think that I would find the story to be a bit lacking.  There is not much character development, and much of the content which made the original so interesting, is missing.  I assume that the constraints of getting the series out in only four parts is the reason, but this lack of content it is unfortunate.

As an aside, both this disc and the 1.1.1 disc have difficulties being recognized by my PS3.  I sometimes have to eject and put them back in 3-4 times before the PS3 reads them.  I have no issues like this with any other Blu-Ray discs that I own.",1308700800,2,789,4.29054054054054
4326430,4,B004CCNB58,"I bought this and felt I needed to give my Amazon rant about it to provide some thoughts to the public - particularly those who know the original (or who are deciding between buying this or the original!).

After being an Eva fan since the release of the original series, I used to watch (and re-watch) every episode intently, fascinated by the multilayered plot, themes and amazing sound and visuals. What we have here with Rebuild 1.11 and 2.22 are a highly desireable and well received remake of the original series that, instead of simply retouching the original, attempts to 'retell' the story in a manner more suitable for a modern audience. There are new scenes, touch ups to original scenes, a new character, a fleshed out story with some slight alterations and 'new' angels. Anno and the Eva team have done this all to create a movie length feature which can summarise 8 or 9-odd episodes worth of material from the original series. While rebuild 1.11 stays quite true to the original, 2.22 beats its own drum. The story here was designed not only to give a greater background to the bigger picture but also sets up the story toward what will be a more generic type of ending we can expect from 3.33 (ie. no unanswered questions). There is less mystery and intrigue, character commentary provides more understanding to what is going on, and much of the soul searching, depth of emotion of the original has, obviously been sacrificed to cater for a much shorter feature time. I was surprised however to see completed redesigns of certain angels, which was fresh.

I have given it 4 stars because of its freshness, storytelling and attention to detail overall. Eva has never lost its appeal after all these years and brings an original and powerful story to the anime public. The amazing mecha designs, battle scenes and plot keep you interested. Where I do feel this remake loses out in comparison to the original is in the soundtrack. I noted numerous changes to the soundtrack and the power of the original score doesn't appear to be here. While new viewers won't take notice of this, I felt a noticeable lack, particularly where the decisive battle and angel attack scores were missing - they added so much to the original but instead we are left with a silent tension in parts of the story were they would have worked to great affect. This unfortunately appears to affect both 1.11 and 2.22 and seems, to me at least, to be a strange direction choice. Happily though, unlike the DVD version of the 1.01 rebuild, the voices of Ikari and Misato (in English) have been faithfully reused and the English voices sound as they originally did.

Another change is character development, new characters and new angels. This is, of course, quite major. I have an opposing view on this. On the one hand, it certainly adds to the story, and fleshes it out more. Particular characters become more transparent, they can be better understood. On the other hand,certain other characters, such as the new Mari, parlay between an important set piece yet having no true impact to the story whatsoever. She is very much a 2D character that seems to have been thrown in to counter the undecisive, fragile persona of Shinji. While it's exciting to have a new character, I couldn't help but feeling Mari's addition was incohesive and slightly odd. She is a lively character, yet lifeless, without purpose and her movements appear to go unnoticed by NERV or SEELE. However, I can fully appreciate her addition, soley because she provides a counterpoint by which we can better weigh the character degredation of Asuka, perhaps in 3.33.

Lastly, I must say that the mystery and intrigue of the original series has been slightly compromised in the rebuilds. This may of course be to accommodate the feature length, but part of what made the original so great was the fact you could not understand many things until it was all over - rather than being able to understand it while it happens in the rebuilds. This just comes down to individual taste. While the original stays elusive, complex and dark - a mirror image of Shinji - the rebuilds are instead, straightforward, progressive, and bold.

Overall, I cannot do without the rebuilds in my collection - they are another great success for Anno. 2.22 had me glued to the tv, amazed at the changes and listening closely to pick up things I now understand better than what I did when watching the original. I love the crystal quality of the animation and the consistent pace of the story, as well as the fresh wonderful character development. But, I can't sell my old collection, ever. It has the blunt and raw power in its thematics, depth, and musical score, not to mention an intrigue the rebuilds will never match. I do think it is worth spending money to buy the rebuilds even if you own the original, just to enjoy Evangelion all over again - just be aware it lacks some of the haunting intrigue and darkness of the original.",1308700800,29,4966,4.72318339100346
4326431,5,B004CCNB58,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Evangelion 2.22 You Can Not Advance.  First off the visuals are simply stunning to behold on a television capable of displaying 1080P.  From the detail lavished upon the armaments buildings of Tokyo 3, to the new Angel designs, to the animated Evangelions, to the on screen information graphics etc. the tv show looks dull and boring in comparison.  The sound track once again is offered with an English 6.1 dub that sounds like a summer action movie block buster.  Also a Japan 6.1 dub is included which emphasizes the dialog over all other sounds.  This movie also includes a running commentary from the English voice over cast talking about their impressions of doing the voice dubbing work for the first two Rebuild of Evangelion films.  The extras on this movie includes some deleted scenes as well as a remixed scene.  However the extras are still kind of lite considering the storage capacity of a Blu-Ray disc.

Plot wise this movie makes it very clear this is an alternate universe Evangelion loosely based upon the tv show.  Whereas the first movie, 1.11, had subtle hints this movie is like a lead pipe in comparison.  While the first movie deviated from the tv show here or there, this movie diverges from the tv show plot dramatically from the very first scene.  In my opinion I rather like the new direction the francise is going.  I was sort of disappointed with the first movie as it appeared to be the first six tv episodes with better graphics.  This movie is like twelve tv episodes condensed into a nearly two hour action packed movie spectacular as it tears down what the tv show established story wise.  In the end I am left wanting parts three and four as I really want to know how this version of the story plays out.

Some have mentioned the cheaper style packaging used for 2.22 as opposed to the 1.11 glossy package.  I too am disappointed but Evangelion 2.22 is not the only one guilty of this.  The sad fact of the matter is Blu-Ray as a format came out too late in the game compared to DVD and Laser Disc before it.  Unlike DVD and LD, Blu-Ray has to compete against high speed broad band to the home which makes it easier for viewers to either stream or steal HD content with the press of a button.  As Blu-Ray sales erode to HD streaming and stealing, Blu-Ray content publishers are going to cut costs to keep their profits up however they can.  Cheaping out the packaging is one easy way to accomplish this.

On the upside at least 2.22 is the only version available for this movie.  There is no 2.02 version unlike the 1.01 debacle with the first movie.  For anyone who doesn't already know, don't bother getting the 1.01 version of the first movie.  Only get the 1.11 version of the first movie.",1308009600,,2772,4.542338709677419

4326434,4,B004CCNB58,"I first saw this in the subbed version, and eagerly awaited the dubbed version.

Sadly, only about half the voice actors came back to do this release, and its not being produced by the same people who did the original dubbing for the series and all interations of it. It does take away from what I knew Eva to be... With Rei and Fuyutski and Gendo all being voiced by someone else... it threw me off. Even some parts from the series got reworded... One of the prime examples is the graveyard scene, where Gendo says ""Burying memories is man's way of survival, but there are some things man should never forget."" It got reworded to something completely not as powerful or as structured, and Gendo comes off less powerful and more like an average person.

Since they've recreated the series and added a new character and tossed the story around a bit, there seems to be a total lack of character development, and the majority of the new voice actors don't have the same tone that made the dubbed version so good. The story, however, is amazing, and the effects are great. The direction Anno took with this is for sure different, and I cannot wait for the last two movies.

If you liked the old series, this is definately a rebuild. The first movie didn't show much of a change, but this movie does. If you want to get someone into Eva, this is not the way to do it.

The story still follows a little toward the anime still, but you'll be able to tell that the next movie will be totally new. Again, I'll have to praise the visuals. They turn up the figurative heat on the action, and it is just fun to watch. The way the Evas move, and fight is just so much fun to watch. Also, added perk: The japanese track is on here. I recommend watching it subbed, and dubbed. Both are equally good.

Pros: So much action in this one, you'll be on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding through your ribcage.
  Visuals and action together. Great in HD.
  Japanese and English tracks.
  Tons of extra stuff after the feature.

Cons: The story doesn't move as fast, but as I've said on my review for 1.11; if you didn't watch the anime series or 1.11... you might be a little lost.
  3.33 won't be out until 2012... late 2012... possibly early 2013 for us if Gainax flips a gasket again.",1306713600,,1195,4.247787610619469

I have never seen the TV series. The movie was in English and I thought the actors did a very good job reading the lines. There are many questions yet to be answered about what is really going on behind the plot in the movie.

4326440,3,B004CCNB58,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS!!!!

I was a HUGE fan of the original evangelion series.  It's still up there as one of my top ten even after all this time.  So I was very excited when 1.11 came out, and it did not disappoint.  It was essentially an upgraded version of the first 6 episodes.  Thats what I was hoping for with 2.22, but thats not what we got.

The rebuild was desperately trying to fill in some of the glaring omissions and confusing sections of the original evangelion... which I fell it did.  Alot of the ""conceptual"" plot elements are alot more clear to me now.  BUT they fixed these issues by totally gutting all the character developments and dialogue interactions that made the original series so great.  The worst example of this is in Shinji and Asuka's relationship.  That is to say, there virtually is none now.

SPOILERS!!!!!

In the original series there was a rich dynamic between Shinji, Asuka, and ""wonder-girl"" Ayanami.  But that just doesnt exist here.  What they spend hours developing in the original series, they condensed to about 10 minutes in this version.  And when they killed (or maimed, they were unclear...) Asuka in this version, I initially thought, BRILLIANT move!  Its so much more moving and emotional... until I realized that it wasnt.  I didn't care about Asuka at all in this version.  All the complexity and likability had been robbed from the character, and she's now just a caricature of her former self.

All of my favorite Asuka moments were gone.  Her introduction where unit 002 is leapfrogging from aircraft carrier to aircraft carrier hunting an angel is gone.  The magma diving is gone.  The episode where she and shinji have to learn to operate in synchronous by doing everything simultaneously (one of my favorite episodes) gone.  So when Asuka dies... I just didn't care.  Why whould I, in this version Asuka is almost a bit character who does nothing but whine, trashtalk, and make dumb decisions.

But despite all this, the remake is still pretty cool.  The action is flawless and exciting, the new versions of the Angels are breathtaking, and alot of questions I had from the original had been answered, but I was very disappointed by the things that were lost in pursuit of the glitzy new vision of Eva.",1306454400,8,2267,4.763496143958869

4326442,5,B004CCNB58,"I truthfully could not stand the original series. It was hard to follow and irritating to watch. I basically wanted to kill all the characters, especially Shinji. The anime is truly horrid and really doesn't deserve the praise it got.

Eva 2.22 is different. All the characters are LIKEABLE. You can actually somewhat relate, and not have to deal with a certain completely psychotic flat character. The new character, angels, as well as the re-imagined angels just enjoyable and make it a great series.

I personally can't wait for Eva 3.33 due to how the story is setup and told. Eva 1.11 and 2.22 are so well done that they are truly memorable for their store, rather then the original anime which was memorable for it being incredibly stupid and confusing.",1306368000,,759,4.786259541984733
4326443,5,B004CCNB58,"[Minor spoilers below]

Proceed to the bottom of this review for a short checklist/summary of why I bought it and why you may want to as well.

First of all, to acknowledge other reviews I've read I'll say this. Yes, the fanservice is a bit over the top and wasn't really needed, yes the new character Mari does seem unneeded, yes the cookoff between Rei and Asuka is a tad bit sexist if you look at everything in a jaded, cynical point of view. But just accept Evangelion with all it's flaws and obscurities, if you can't do that then I have no idea why you'd want to buy this movie. My enjoyment of the movie wasn't affected by any of the things I mentioned above, and if you liked the original series as much as I did then they shouldn't affect you either.
-I didn't care about the fanservice, it doesn't make me any more or less inclined to watch this movie.

-I thought adding a new pilot(Mari) was interesting. I assume they added her in 2.22 to avoid having her look like a last minute add on in 3 or 4. I look forward to seeing her role develop.

-Another reviewer said Rei and Asuka's cookoff was sexist. I admit it can be misinterpreted to be such if you only look at the cooking part, but consider this. Shinji saved Rei in 1.11, and then cooked for her and the others in 2.22. Rei, wanting to return this kindness, wanted to cook for Shinji and the Nerv crew and bring Shinji and his father closer. Asuka, being jealous as usual, must outdo Rei in everything, including cooking. It's not so much that it's sexist, it's just one more thing Asuka must one-up Rei in.

As I said before I'm a big fan of the original series, which I own in addition to 1.11, 2.22, and Death & Rebirth/End of Evangelion.

What I had to do to better understand the Rebuilds was have the prior knowledge of the original series. If you add your knowledge of the characters from the Tv series to the new plot in the Rebuild series then you should see why everything comes out as it has. I was surprised that people were complaining about some scenes being true to the source material. Usually in anime I see people complain about filler and deviation from the original manga/anime. My point being this. Asuka and Rei were both attracted to Shinji in the original series, but neither were able to express it very well. This would obviously not change in the rebuilds as it's one of the most important conflicts between the two. Obviously in a barely 2 hour movie you don't have time to build up a gigantic getting to know you/love you subplot between characters, so the romantic aspect seems rushed, but if you watched the Tv series then you can better understand it.

Also about the Unit 3 test disaster, it differs from the Tv series in that Asuka pilots it instead of Toji. A previous reviewer mentioned this, saying it destroyed a major plot point of the Tv series in that only select individuals can pilot select Eva's. Well I'll be blunt by saying that you're wrong in that regard. Technically speaking, anyone can pilot any Eva as long as the Eva accepts that particular pilot. This is stated in the first episode and others when it's mentioned that Rei can pilot both unit 0 and unit 1 because of her connection to Shinji's mother Yui(which I won't go into because of spoilers). Also, the only reason Toji was Unit 3's pilot in the Tv series was to create the conflict between Shinji and his father, I.E. ""I hate you dad you made me almost kill my best friend."" Where was Toji's special connection to unit 3 hmmm? There wasn't one. If I had to guess the only thing that makes him qualified is his hatred of Eva's and Angels for injuring his sister, and that anger could be useful in a battle where strong willpower is required. Also, Shinji and Asuka are able to jointly pilot Unit 2 when they first meet, further showing other individuals that do not have a special attachment to an Eva can pilot one. In theory, anyone can pilot any Eva, but the Eva's can choose who they accept and who they do not.

~EDIT~
A previous reviewer mentioned that Shinji's apprehension to kill Asuka while she was trapped in Unit 3 was a dumb plot point because he barely knows her. So your saying that a fourteen year old child not wanting to end another child's life is dumb? He's a scared kid who usually has trouble justifying killing the ANGELS, let alone another human being.

THE SHORT OF IT.
-Yes, a lot of fanservice, if your into that.
-Yes, stunning visuals/sound, good action.
-Yes, a new character with a very, very minor role.
-Yes, a bit of a cookoff between Asuka and Rei that seems rushed but necessarily so.
-Yes, Shinji continues to whine even though he's got every fourteen year old boy's dream. A giant robot and more girls then he knows what to do with.
-Yes it does seem like a lot of plot crammed into 2 hours, but the original series was a mishmash, often in-cohesive, flawed masterpiece as well.

My advice, watch the original series and End of Evangelion before buying the rebuilds, you'll understand them and appreciate them much more then a newcomer to the series would.",1306195200,5,5073,4.456896551724138

4326446,4,B004CCNB58,"Eva 2.22 took forever to get to America but was well worth the wait. Rather than discuss the movie I'd rather just review the packaging and Blu-ray quality.

Packaging: Funimation dropped the ball on this one. It looks nothing like the exquisite packaging from 1.11 and does not follow the same motif at all. The Orange slip-cover may look nice in pictures but soon after arrival it will begin to fall apart, as the paint will chip at the slightest of touch. The included booklet of pictures and terms is a nice addition and was well thought-out and executed.

Quality: By far this is the best looking anime out on the market today. Visually the animation is stunning and within 2.22 the creative staff did an excellent job of blending 3D and 2D animation seamlessly. Funimation's transfer is crystal clear and has no major artifacting. The included extras are held to the same standard coming in bright, clean, and in HD. The HD audio mix for both English and Japanese is very well done and there is even an included extra to tell you about the audio mixing difference between the English and Japanese tracks. Audio commentary is included, but rather than discuss the film itself the English director chooses to discuss random topics with the cast. This was interesting but I would have much rather had a commentary about the film.

Overall, I enjoyed the film, Blu-Ray quality, and extras. One star knock off for Funimation dropping the ball on the slip-cover and the inconsistency with 1.11's packaging.",1305504000,,1506,4.806949806949807

While I do agree that the original series ended on a rather less than uplifting note (once I factored in End Of Evangelion), I still thought it was a fascinating series to watch. Imagine my surprise when Gainax announced a series of Rebuild films, made to represent Anno's original vision for the show. I was excited. The first film was more of a retelling of the first 6 episodes of the series, and while it was great to see brand new animation to some of my favorite moments, I felt that it had a been there done that film. The second film, is just absolutely amazing. Dazzling animation, great character moments and humor, and probably one of the more emotional climaxes I've seen in an anime.

Amazing chapter in the evangelion rebuild, a must see and must own for any Eva fan.

It would have been nice to have vignettes with the cast and crew about the behind the scenes making of the film... the commentary was mildly amusing at least.

Those of us in the USA have been waiting patiently for two years, since it's Japanese release, for it to be doubed in English and released in the states.  It was well worth the wait! Doubed using most of the original US cast, and the imagery shown utilizing the latest in technology, breaths new life into the story.  It it truly spectacular! As for the storyline, it continues to parallel the original story up to a point then you realize the Angels are more spectacular and more powerful.  This adds more action to the full feature movie, not to mention the music.  Yes, I must comment about the music.  Even though I am a member of an orchestra, I feel everyone who sees the movie would agree that the powerful music written and conducted by Shiro Sagisu, is not over the top but adds to he drama and the spectacle of 60 foot tall giant bio-robots.  Also, the storyline has been expanded and we get a better understanding of the characters...call it character development...  Finally, for all the fans that waited for this release, there is an alternate audio track of commentary by the US cast and a second disk in the case that has 40 minutes of extras showing things like the technology behind the movie.  Also there is a 20 page guidebook.  The book is full of information to help those new to Evangelion to quickly catch up and understand this movie better (this anime is known for it's complex storyline combined with sporadic religious imagery).

4326475,3,B004CCNB58,"I'm a huge fan of the original series, which was an uncompromising personal artistic statement by its director, Hideaki Anno.  Despite its enduring popularity, it was not a series that pandered to a mass audience.  Those who say it fell apart at the end are sort of right, but the later release of the two movies ""Death and Rebirth"" and ""The End of Evangelion"" - which Anno has said restored his original vision for the series ending - redeemed that ending and properly completed an artistic masterpiece.

The two ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" films released so far are kind of an unnecessary update to the original series, condensed to the point of losing much of what made the original story so special and with alterations that in most cases seem gratuitous or even random.  This is even more true of Evangelion 2.22 than it was of 1.11.

For example, in the original series, the Eva pilots were all matched to a particular Eva unit, and there was a good reason for that (without getting into spoilers).  Eva pilots were physically and mentally incapable of piloting any Eva unit other than their own.  However, in Evangelion 2.22, pilots and Evas are mixed and matched seemingly at will, and new pilots and Evas are introduced that didn't exist in the original series, which are then mixed and matched too.  Unless both the reason and means for this are explained in later films, this seemingly destroys one of the central plot points of the entire series (the nature of the Evangelions).  There are many such examples of changes to the plot that some may not even notice at first, but which drastically alter what the series is all about.

Speaking of the characters, they've also been updated.  The main characters in the original series were all very different but all very rigid in their philosophies, and this lack of self awareness is part of what helped drive the plot forward and also one of the themes of the series.  In Evangelion 2.22, the characters universally mellow to the point that there's not much difference between them.  It's like the end of the Wizard of Oz; Shinji finds his strength, Asuka finds her heart, Rei finds her humanity.  That's nice, and probably something a certain segment of fans wanted to see, but it's going to make the later films (there are 2 more scheduled) a lot less interesting.  Also, there's a new character and Eva pilot named Mari, who at least in this film is completely disposable.  Meanwhile, Shinji's classmates, who played a major role in the series, play no role at all in the plot of this film and simply take up screen time that could have been used to better develop the plot, or Mari's character.

The film is beautiful to look at - like Evangelion 1.11, it maintains the visual style of the original series while updating almost every shot to CGI.  It may not be obvious in every shot, but many shots were created in CG and then processed to look like film, with a judder effect.  On the other hand, there are a *lot* of ""fan service"" shots in this film, which may be good or bad depending on your point of view.

I won't give away any spoilers but the ending of the film also leaves me wondering where they go from here, and how they're going to manage to fill out two more complete films.  They're basically already halfway through ""The End of Evangelion"".  I think they simply tried to do too much in 2 hours of screen time.

Overall, as a big fan of the series, it's nice to see these characters again and it's nice to have something new going on, but if you felt the original series was flawed, the current film series is even more flawed.  And while the original series was more or less one man's artistic vision, the current films feel more like filmmaking by committee with maximum box office receipts in mind.",1302998400,34,3777,4.594634873323398
4326476,5,B004CCNB58,This is nothing like Rebuild 1.11 thats just a repolished  version of the first episodes. This goes in an all new direction & shows the characters in an all new light. Most of the film is all new work and any fan of the series should watch. REPEAT: this is not a rehash of old footage digitized this is a new retelling of an old story in a different (BETTER) way.,1302998400,2,363,4.112676056338028
4326477,5,B004CCNB58,"This movie, totally just blew my mind. It was fawking great! I recommend anyone to really watch the original series first before watching the new Rebuild films. Ive been an Evangelion fan for sometime now. Started watching it at age 16 and I was really confused at the time since this story's themes contain psychological and philosophical material in it. But I loved watching it for the art, robots, characters and eventually the story. After watching this, it became instantly the greatest movie I have ever seen. It used to be Citizen Kane and the Dark Knight. But screw that, since this one just had more to offer and the plot is just incredible.
With all that being said, I wonder. When will good anime films (such as Evangelion)hit the big screens? I mean sure it has. like...ugh, Pokemon? And that was it. Japan gets the theatrical release, and some places around the world (even the U.S) it also gets shown but in limited locations. I wish one day I could see a great anime that will be as popular as inception or the social network, and have a powerful story, setting, animation, directing,and visuals as good as Evangelion. . .

Uhh, other than that, the movie was great. :D",1302998400,3,1184,4.6380952380952385
4326478,2,B004CCNB58,"This won't be a popular post with the sheeple, but it is my opinion. I am a fan of the original series which was flawed but mostly a masterpiece and the first movie was very good. I had high hopes about this one's new direction.  That being said this movie is close to being awful. I would rate it a very low C-. I will watch the next two movies only for Kaworu's part, but won't make the same mistake of buying them. I should have known there was a reason 2.22 was so cheap, save your money, if you need to see it.. rent this or watch it . I am trading my copy back in to Amazon. Hideaki Anno should be ashamed that the Gainex cash cow has fallen to this level. First we are introduced to the new experimental Eva pilot Mari. She should be named ""Mari Sue"" because she seems like a made up character from  really bad fan fiction written by 15 year olds. It is obvious by her boob size she is the new it girl for the figuring market for desperate guys who crave the always promised ""fan service"", but this time from a girl in glasses. (megane ko) She is given some of the more important parts. She is supposedly a secret badass who can almost single handedly endures pain to kill angels and help Shinji overcome his doubt at piloting his Eva. An example of stupid plot holes is we are told that Asuka was in graduate school and is a captain, to illustrate her awesomeness at her young age ... so then why does she go to school with Shinji? I admit the graphics are amazing, the colors really pop since they are almost neon in some scenes. My advice is rent, don't buy!",1302998400,19,1568,4.154605263157895
4326479,5,B004CCNB58,"The first time I saw Neon Genesis Evangelion was in about 2002 on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. It has become one of my favourite shows and I'm not overly into anime. The ending/endings of the show were truly love them or hate them and while I enjoyed them I can see why people don't. When I found out that they were remaking the series into movies I was interested but never knew that this would turn out the way it did. The movie is less about reinacting moments from the series like in the first movie but actually recreating them with some spectactular fight scenes with stunning animation and some great sound as I found the english and japanese languages to be very good in terms of quality. The story is amazingly told and the characters development is good. End of Evangelion had some very disturbing moments in it I found some scenes in this film to very disturbing to that same level (I won't spoil them here) and the ending is brilliant. I look forward to when 3.0/3.33 comes out (which is probably going to take a while) and would definately order it off Amazon again and just saying, I ordered it in New Zealand and it arrived in 16 days.

4326481,5,B004CCNB58,"Evangelion 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" is fantastic!  I was awestruck from beginning to end and I have no doubt in my mind that this title will rank high in my top 5 anime on Blu-ray releases for 2011.  This anime film is AWESOME!  I absolutely loved every minute of it!  Highly recommended!

In 2006, Japanese fans and anime fans of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" received exciting news that in the Summer of 2007, the first of four Evangelion films based on the anime television series would be released in theaters. According to news reports, Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno watched the series from beginning to end and wanted to fix up a lot of questions and debates that fans had over the television series and most importantly, incorporate today's new CG technology for the film versions. Even furthering the excitement is that the original crew and cast have signed on to work on the new film.

The first film did tremendously well and what made things much more exciting for the promotion of the second film is the introduction of a new Evangelion pilot named Mari Illustrious Makinami, the confident pilot of the Provisional Evangelion Unit-05 and also a teaser for Unit-06.  The full trailer was released on April 2, 2009 and fans of the series and films had a chance to see a dark Eva, Mari, a new Eva-02 design, new designs of Angels and more.

So, with mass promotion in Japan, ""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" was released in Japan on June 27, 2009 and similar to the first film, was #1 in the box office earning over $40 million (US) in Japan and also received a US theatrical release in January 2011.

With many Americans waiting for ""Evangelion 1.11' Blu-ray release, suffice to say, the film was released with a very short run at limited theaters and made over $100,000 and was screened at the anime convention Anime Expo in 2009 with great fanfare.

""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" opens with the new Evangelion pilot, Mari Illustrious Makinami who pilots the Provisional Unit-05 and is trying to destroy the skeleton of the Third Angel which is attacking NERV's arctic Bethany Base and manages to do so by self-destructing her own unit and barely escaping.

As Shinji and his father Gendo visit their dead mother, Yui's grave, the new Unit-02 has arrived to the base and we are introduced to its abrasive, confident pilot, Asuka Langley Shikinami.  Meanwhile, Chief Inspector Ryoji Kaji delivers an object in a suitcase to Gendo known as the ""Key of Nebuchadnezzar"".

As for Shinji and Asuka, their first meeting doesn't go quite well as Asuka kicks Shinji and looks at him as a weakling who only got his position because he's the son of Gendo.  Asuka ends up moving in with Misato Katsuragi and Shiji Ikari (along with Pen Pen the Penguin) and takes up Shinji's room.  While Shinji tries to be much more open to Asuka, she can't stand being near him.

Meanwhile, Shinji, Rei, Asuka and Shinji's two high school friends try to socialize and have fun.  Together they visit a research aquarium which tries to maintain and resuscitate ocean ecosystems lost in the Second Impact.  But as everyone tries to become used to their social life at school and with each other, all three Evangelions are called into battle to engage on the Eight Angel and a test for Shinji, Asuka and Rei to work as a team and they suffer major damages.  Unfortunatel, SEELE has declared that the Unit-00 has served its purpose and no longer needs to be repaired.

As for Gendo, he and Fuyutsuki visit the Tabgha Base to view SEELE's progress on the creation of Evangelion Mark. 06 and they see the mysterious Kawaoru Nagisa sitting on its finger.

As things seem to be quiet and no new attacks are happening, Rei really wants to bring Shinji and his father together.  At first Gendo tells Rei that he is too busy but he see's Yui telling him to be there for his son and he agrees.  So, Rei with the help of Misato begin to invite people to the dinner party.

On the day of the dinner party, it is learned that Evangelion Unit-04 and NERV's U.S. branch are destroyed while testing an experimental engine, meanwhile the U.S. government has completed Unit-03 has has sent it to Tokyo.  Because of the ""Vatican Treaty"" which allows countries to possess only three functioning Evangelions at at a time, the Unit-02 is sealed away.  Rei is chosen to pilot the new Eva but Asuka offers to do it as Rei can host the dinner party.

As Asuka pilots the Unit-03, upon activation, something goes wrong and it is revealed that the Unit has been possessed by the Ninth Angel and unfortunately, with Asuka inside, Shinji must pilot his EVA and destroy it.  But Shinji is unwilling to have Asuka's blood in his hands and his father gives him a direct order which Shinji is unwilling to do.  So, Gendo gives the order to activate the dummy system and Shinji would no longer have access to control the EVA.  We then see the EVA fighting on its own as it destroys the Ninth Angel and Shinji cries and screams of how his father can use him in such a way.  Shinji's EVA ends up crushing Asuka's entry plug and we see Shinji, disgusted by his father and NERV's actions, quitting NERV.

While Asuka survives but is deeply wounded and fears that she may have been contaminated by an Angel and with Shinji gone, the Tenth Angel comes to attack.  But unfortunately, without Shinji, the Unit-01 refuses to activate the dummy system and thus, the new pilot Mari ends up hijacking Unit-02 to fight the Tenth Angel on her own.

Who will live?  Who will die? Will Shinji be the same after what happened?

VIDEO:

""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" is featured in 1080p High Definition. I had the opportunity to compare the Blu-ray to the 2.22 DVD release from FUNimation Entertainment from last fall and I can tell you right now that this Blu-ray looks fantastic. Detail is much more apparent and the vibrancy of the colors of the film literally pop onscreen. The CG animation is top notch and overall, Gainax definitely went all out in creating a fantastic anime full of detail, vibrant colors and staying faithful to the anime series but making sure everything is updated and looks amazing.

But I will say that while the majority of the film featured animation perfection, right when the film begins as we are introduced to Maki, that scene displays some banding.  And while the scene is not long at all, that was the only scene where I found anything that can be deemed as negative by videophiles.  I saw no artifacts, black levels were great and colors were vibrant.  But the animation and just the newer footage just looks incredible.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 6.1 English and Japanese lossless soundtrack and there is good use of all channels. From hearing the music and main character vocal coming from the center and front channels, you will then hear the loudspeakers through the surround channels and then the rear surround channels carry audio that is different. For example, in one scene in which Shinji screaming out of his Eva, you hear the main characters and vocals through the center and front channels, loud speakers and musical instruments on the surround and on the rear surround channel, you hear Shinji screaming in agony behind you.

There is so much action and destruction featured in this second film that there is good use of LFE.  Personally, the lossless audio is just phenomenal, how it is so immersive and envelops the soundscape from all directions was fantastic. And I am so happy to find out that the Japanese audio track is lossless as well. Something that fans have wanted from anime on Blu-ray!

As for the dubbing, both soundtracks are well-done and it's great that FUNimation used the majority of the original cast for the film.  While I do feel that the Japanese soundtrack is able to capture the more desperate emotions quite well, the English voice actors did a wonderful job in this release as well.  Personally, it all comes to preference and whichever lossless soundtrack that you choose, they are both excellent.

As for subtitles, the subtitles on the Blu-ray are in English only.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" contains the following special features:

  * US Cast Commentary - I found this audio commentary to be fantastic.  Similar to what ADR Director Mike McFarland did with the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" film and giving 10-15 minutes for each voice actor, he does the same with this audio commentary as we hear voice talent (even some we haven't heard from for awhile) to talk about the characters, the changes and difference from the original TV series from the films.  Very insightful and fun to listen to (AFTER) you watched the movie as there are some spoilers.
  * Rebuild of Evangelion 2.02 - (22:22) A montage of pre-production sketches, renders and final renders.
  * ""I Would Give You Anything Scene (Noguchi ver.) - (4:58) This segment features a different singer it appears for the song ""Tsubasa wo Kudasai"".  It's actually much better but I think the director wanted a voice that was not so polished and capturing more of a raw singing vocal for that scene.
  * Omitted Scenes - A total of four omitted scenes.
  * Original Trailer - (1:22) The original theatrical trailer for ""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"".
  * Train Channel Spot - (:14) Another teaser trailer for ""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"".
  * Japanese TV Spots - (1:38) TV spots for ""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"".
  * Blu-ray and DVD - TV Spot Type A (:17), TV Spot Type B (:17), Promotion Reel (1:57)
  * FUNimation Entertainment Trailers

EXTRAS:

""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" comes with a special, embossed slip over case cover (with open flap).

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first heard that the rebuild of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" would take place and that these new films would be based on the television series, I wasn't so surprised because the series is so popular that it would definitely generate an extreme amount of money for GAINAX. But one thing that I was not looking forward and what drove me crazy about the TV series was the character of Shinji Ikari. Back in the mid-90's, I can easily remember how his whining really tested my patience and looking back, he was such an anti-hero, mainly because he was ""emo"" most of the time. Always negative, always in a bit of depression and funk as he always felt people didn't care about him (and yes, I know that Hideaki Anno was clinically depressed when he was creating this film and parts of show was based on his depression) but it did get on my nerves at the time.

But here we are 15 years later and here I am watching ""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" and loving every minute of it.

Yes, Shinji still whines but its more tolerable in the film version.  Changes were made to make him slightly less whiny and more courageous.  The film is structured a bit differently from the anime TV series and somehow, the pacing is much easier to take for the viewer with the film version and felt that the screenplay for the first film, the quality of the animation and artistic backgrounds and the music all worked together fantastically.  I found myself happy and content with this sequel and even enjoyed it much more than the first film (which was awesome) and  I look forward to seeing how Anno and the GAINAX crew tweaks the next film.

I was quite amazed to see the number of changes that were implemented in the second film.  To see the new character Maki, to see the new designs for the EVA units and Angels and to see changes in the storyline (including Asuka's last name), not to say that the storyline was completely redone but there were significant changes and I will say how much I loved the storyline for this second film and the changes that were done over the TV series.  I'm sure purists will have problems with the changes but seriously, I love where the film is going and how things are structured.  Also, the animation and voice acting is absolutely wonderful!

As for the Blu-ray release, this release was just fantastic. Not entirely perfect as there is slight banding but for the majority of the film, picture quality was awesome and I love the 6.1 lossless soundtrack.  The soundtrack was much better this time around for both vocal tracks and I loved how the channels, including the surround, rear surround and LFE were used for this film.  As for special features, they are short but the biggest addition was the commentary track and it was good thinking by ADR director Mike McFarland to interview as many voice talent as possible.  I really enjoyed the commentary track.

Fifteen years later, it was definitely great to see Evangelion sporting newer animation, CG, artwork and a solid screenplay and soundtrack. But most importantly, done in the way that the director Hideaki Anno had wanted and so far, the majority of fans have been supportive of the storyline thus far. And after I watched this second film, I can tell you that I loved every minute of it! The action, the drama is still intact. Things may be a little different but still, fans of the original series will definitely enjoy this film release.

""Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance"" will surprise you.  It will excite you.  And I have no doubt that the majority of EVA fans will find this second film intriguing and awesome!

This is a must-buy EVA release!  Highly recommended!",1302652800,6,13497,4.6856173101400085

4326483,5,B004CCNB58,"This movie is Amazing 10 out of 10. If you liked the original you'll love this and those of you new to the Eva or Anime scene will be hooked.  Restarting the Eva series not an easy task.  2.22 is took 1.11 to the next level. Sure some changes where made and a new character was added but it doesn't mean the original wasn't great or that it's creator meant it should be this way from the start/original, it`s a new rendition of a classic. I'll be honest some minor parts/scenes aren't as powerful as the original but others take it to a hole new level of awesome.  It's like building a house the way you wanted it.  It's perfect but then 10 years later he thinks: I kind of wish I did this part a bit differently or I wonder how it would work if this was rearranged a bit.

4326484,5,B004CCNB58,"I'm not going to give anything away. The new character, Maki, adds an extra layer of excitement and mystery to a story already full of these elements. Old characters get personality makeovers, and the whole story just fits together in a tighter way.

Other reviews have explained the Rebuild project, so I'll skip that. As a fan of the original TV anime and the movies, I went into this second installment thinking that despite the changes, I knew what was coming. WRONG. The visuals are improved in every possible way. The Eva battles are more...more fluid in animation, more colorful, more exciting, just all around improved. New characters, and new takes on old characters give the old story the perfect facelift. As fan of Gainax and Evangelion, the attention to detail and the music in this movie makes me feel like the movie truly was designed with fans in mind.

It does help to see the first movie, but its not entirely necessary, the plot and characters are pretty self-evident.

I recommend this movie to fans of the old series and anyone who's just looking for an experience in mind-bending science fiction. The quality of the animation is top-notch, the English voice acting is good, the soundtrack fits perfectly, it's just an excellent movie all around. 5 stars!",1302307200,,1276,4.844036697247707
4326485,1,B004CCNB58,"For a long-time fan of the original TV series, watching Eva 2.0 is like meeting up with an old friend--only to find out that he peaked in high school and is now a prematurely balding alcoholic with a dead-end job at the DMV.  I really can't imagine who this movie is aimed at.  If this movie is aimed at newcomers to the franchise, they will likely be totally confused; Eva 2.0 has the feel of a clipshow, with too much plot and too many characters in too small a time frame.  If if it's aimed at fans of the original, well, they're pretty much guaranteed to hate it, at least if they liked it the first time around.

Now, don't get me wrong---the original NGE was not a great TV series and, if we're honest, probably not even a very good one.  Nevertheless, if you watched it at the right time in life, i.e. circa fourteen or so, it was like discovering Catcher in the Rye and Star Wars at the same time.  Even though the show was wildly uneven, there was an emotional rawness that made the absurd story of emotionally damaged kids and giant space monsters peculiarly compelling.  Not so the remake.  Even though it's less blatantly lazy than 1.0, which was literally an HD repackaging of the TV show, Eva 2.0 reeks of George Lucas-esque cynicism.  While the animation is faultless and the space monsters are still cool, the script is the most amateurish piece of hackery imaginable, so incoherent that you'll wonder if there's a reel or two missing.  Furthermore, while the TV series was hardly a masterpiece of feminism, Eva 2.0 is so rancidly misogynistic that it makes Lars von Trier's Antichrist look like a Gloria Steinem tract.  In the bizarre moral universe of this movie, opening up to other people means getting back in the kitchen, at least if you're a woman, and failing to win the protagonist's affections is a surefire ticket to ostracism and mutilation.  I really wish I were exaggerating, but that's pretty much literally what happens.  Spoilers follow, if you care.

The most noticeable difference between Eva 2.0 and the original series is the new focus on the relationship between Shinji and Rei.  This would be fine if said relationship were particularly convincing or if Rei hadn't been lobotomized somewhere between the original show and the remake, but alas, it isn't and she has.  Rei didn't have phenomenal depth in the original series, but here she's completely lost her introspective dimension and otherworldly unwholesomeness, becoming merely a fetishy anime stereotype who does little but make adoring faces at our intrepid hero.  I'm serious.  She has a look of wide-eyed awe when he so much as gives her a cup of soup.  (Ritualistic food exchanges, which become a recurring ""motif"" in this turkey of a film, are here used to hide the fact that Khara's staff can't write convincing human interaction.)

Asuka fares even worse, if that's possible.  The writers and/or director clearly have no idea what to do with Asuka now that Rei's the heroince, but insist on cramming her into the movie anyway, knowing, I guess, that you can't have a piece of Evangelion merchandise without her.  There is a very odd and perfunctory attempt to give her a relationship to Shinji--she has about two scenes with him, suddenly decides that she wants his schlang, has a shojo-esque cook-off with Rei to win his affections (again, I wish I were joking), before just as arbitrarily deciding that she's fine being alone forever.  What our intrepid hero thinks of any of this is entirely unclear; Asuka spends an uncomfortable amount of time sitting by herself in a corner while every other character has happy fun time around her.  None of this would matter much if the writers hadn't made the absolutely bone-headed decision to make Asuka the pilot of the infected Eva unit instead of Toji.  We're suddenly supposed to feel bad for Shinji when he has to kill a girl whom he's treated like gum stuck to his shoe for the majority of the movie; the entire subplot is painfully tone-deaf.

The worst part is that Shinji's battle with the infected Eva unit was one of the most powerful scenes of the original series, and Eva 2.0 repeats it almost shot-for-shot as if bound and determined to remind us how much better the TV series was. Eva 2.0 doesn't let you forget for a second that you're watching a remake of a 90s TV show; it relies on the source materiel the way Family Guy relies on dated pop culture references.  Taken on its own, Eva 2.0 is baffling and emotionally hollow, but we as viewers are expected to clap like trained seals when we see a scene we recognize.  As with the Star Wars prequels, the only real selling point is the production values and the ""Look! It's Yoda!"" moments.

Oh yeah, and there's a new character.  If I haven't mentioned her before, it's because she has no discernible role in this story.  You could literally edit her out of the movie without changing a thing; it's painfully obvious that she was created for merchandising purposes, not because anyone at Khara had a genuinely new story to tell.  Really, there is so much wrong with this movie that I'd need twenty thousand words or more to cover all the ways in which it's crassly insulting.  Imagine Tron: Legacy having a baby with The Phantom Menace and an embarrassingly sexist Folger's commercial from the 1950s and you will perhaps begin to understand how painful this was to watch.",1302220800,30,5384,4.699680511182109
4326486,5,B004CCNB58,"I'll start with the objective criticisms first.

Packaging
Evangelion:222 YOU CAN (NOT) ADVANCE arrives in a striking bright orange slipcase.  The cardboard on the slipcase has a slightly textured feel to it and the minimalist front cover design is very attractive.  The slip case is purely cosmetic though as, in a departure from the previous rebuild release, it merely serves as a cover for a standard plastic blu-ray shell case ... with much more mundane box art.  I actually preferred the all cardboard packaging of the first entry in the series because it just looks so good, but I'll hang on to the orange slipcover as well I guess.  Inside you'll find a handy booklet that details some of the creative goals driving the Rebuild project and specifically the second installment.  Also included are brief character bios, information on the art/design aspects of the show (Angels, pilots, new plugsuits etc.), as well as a little glossary and some behind the scenes looks at the animation development.  Overall the booklet is a really cool little perk that comes with this disc, definitely worth the time to thumb through it and read the tiny text.

Video Quality
In a word: excellent.  The second release in the Rebuild series looks fantastic.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are appropriately inky, and fine detail is abundant.  This encode does suffer from color banding in many scenes, something that appears common in most HD anime discs I've seen, but honestly this is a pretty small nit to pick.  F.Y.I.  the color banding I'm talking about is most prevalent in scenes in which characters/objects appear against a mostly monochromatic background.  This most frequently happens when you see an Eva set against the sky, as a light blue transitions into a darker blue the gradations become visible.  This is also present in scenes that feature transitions from lighter to darker areas, and vice versa.  Again this is a minor complaint, and this is honestly the only obvious flaw in this release.  There is no mosquito noise visible even in distant cityscapes, and the CG elements blend well with the digitally ""hand-painted"" animation.  Superb.

Audio Quality
Both the Japanese and English tracks are presented in Dolby TrueHD encodes ... and I'll have to take the manufacturers word on that.  I'm running a soundbar solution which recognizes the 6.1 channels present on disc, but of course any surround effect is only simulated.  That said, the Japanese track does a fine job rendering both the subtle quieter moments and the more chaotic action sequences.  Bass is nice and rumbly during battle scenes but retains definition.  I would love to watch this in a surround set up to see how active the various channels are, but that will have to wait.  One minor annoyance, and this may be remedied when listening in surround for all I know, is that this show tends to stack several layers of dialogue one atop the other.  Often when battle scenes cut to Nerv control you'll have dialogue from three sources, the Eva pilot, the comm officers, and a broadcast style emergency announcer.  These threads, likely intentionally, become difficult to follow, especially when the score becomes active in these scenes.  Again, I'll have to hear the 6.1 encode before I pass final judgement, but overall the audio acquits itself well enough for this transfer.

Extras
There are some extras on this disc, but they lie mostly in the way of promotional material.  There are some cut scenes and a remixed scene, but it's really all just fluff.  There is a commentary track recorded by the English language cast, but since I've never listened to the English dub this feature holds little interest for me.

Subjective Thoughts - possibly some spoilers
Evangelion:222 is actually pretty good.  I don't have too many complaints to make regarding any of the character changes or pacing/plot changes etc.  I know a lot of the reviewers are talking about the changes made to Asuka, but to me Kaji has become a much more interesting character.  His positions in Nerv, Selee, and the level of his involvement in the Human Instrumentality project are still sort of hazy, but I love the fact that Kaji tries to instill in the children a love for the Earth.  There are plenty of battle scenes and even a few good heartfelt moments between a handful of characters, but for me Kaji's scenes really shine.  Watching him teach Shinji how to plant and care for watermelons, or explaining that the sea was blue prior to the ""impact"" really sells it for me.  A big part of Evangelion has always revolved around why each child chooses to pilot the Eva.  Everyone has different reasons, but here we see Kaji trying to make the children understand that there are other, and perhaps far more important, reasons to be the worlds saviors.  Very good stuff.  Anyhow, enough praise for now, as you can tell I'm a big fan of this rebuild so far, but it does have it's flaws as well.

This volume has a lot of action sequences, too many in my opinion.  There is an Angel showing up every 15 minutes or so it seems.  As beautifully animated and choreographed as these set pieces are, for me they quickly became tiring.  You can only watch so much giant robot on giant robot action before fatigue sets in.  Very little in the way of Nerv, Selee, or Human Instrumentality is explored here.  There are some tantalizing tidbits, and of course I don't expect the creators to blow their narrative loads all at once, but I feel that the balance between action and narrative exposition is somewhat out of sync here.  To make matters worse, the climax of this release is nonsensical if you haven't already watched the original series.  I'm assuming this will be addressed in the next release but ... who knows; Evangelion has long been one of the more challenging series out there.  I've always been a big fan of Evangelion's score, but on this release it ranges from good to terrible.  There is a lot of muzak style elevator music going on in this release.  Suffice to say I won't be listening to the soundtrack on my ipod any time soon.

All in all this is a great second installment in the rebuild series, one that shouldn't be missed.  I was hoping for a little more in the way of exposition on this one, but hopefully the frenetic pace will slow down a bit in the next release so we can all get brought up to speed.  If you like Anime, classic Evangelion, giant robots, Christian symbolism, or angsty teenage protagonists, this is the show for you.",1302220800,4,6500,4.76654740608229
4326487,1,B004CCNB58,"Surprised no one pointed this out : Hideaki Anno is a plagiarist. Evangelion is a blatant, and I mean BLATANT, rip-off of ""Mobile Suit Gundam"", the original Gundam series. Rip-off.

Shinji (original name) is a lame attempt at recreating Amuro Ray. A young boy being forced into the military to fight off bad people? Yeah, rip-off. The robots are the poorman's Mobile Suit. Pathetic.

The storyline? What storyline? The series simply doesn't make sense -- and don't tell me that I don't ""understand"" it. It makes no sense.

Gainax has single-handedly ruined Anime and they continue to do so. We went from the great Speed Racer to this garbage, this uninspired garbage. From Gurren Lagann to FLCL. (Speaking of those two, Gainax's consistency of putting underaged characters in ""sexual situations"" is questionable.) It all sucks.",1302220800,7,827,5.111111111111111
4326488,5,B004CCNB58,"I loved this installment of the remake of Evangelion, the reason why I loved this on so much was through out the old series (I absoultly loved it) one thing always jerked at the back of my head why didn't they develop the relationship between Shinji and Rei? it was Obvious after the misshap in Rei's apartment they started to feel somthing for on another, your first comfermation of this was in the episode with the Diamond like angel (sorry I don't remeber the episodes by name) the Angel that they had to use Rei as the human sheild and Shinji as the sniper, when Shinji basically repeats the actions of his father by burning his hands while desperatly trying to pry open Rei's entry plug you get a good idea how Shinji feel about Rei then what hits it home was when Shinji's asked her to smile and she did ( some might say it was just Rei doing what Shinji suggested but I'm sure they was more to it then that). The last confermation of there feelings for one another was with the ring angel the one that tryed to corrupt unit 0 by trying to fuse with it, Rei said before she sacrificed herself for Shinji was "" I want to be come one with Ikari!?"" Rei bascially admmited her feelings straight out, Now the reason why this bugged me so much is the artist never went far with their relationship and in just my opinion it might have made the show a bit better if they did maybe Shinji could have kissed Rei once or somthing just cement what we all were suspecting. BUT IN 2.22 THEY HIT THAT ONE HOME IN THE FIGHT BETWEEN SHINJI and the Angel with the Ribbon like arms that completely OWNS Unit 2, But in it Shinji straight out fights for Rei he admits he cares for her and uses unit 1 to get her I was so very very pleased to watch that seen I practically cheered. I really hope the relationship between Rei and Shinji stay through out the last two installments I don't want to blow this installment up just to find out they crush the relationship in the next one  please I beg please leave it be.

but if your a fan of Evangelion I recomment both 1.11 and 2.22 both are breath takeing they did an amazing job on these and the story they are cranking out for em is so very satisfying.",1302220800,,2185,4.22488038277512

4326491,5,B004CCNB58,"Only recently have I gotten back into watching anime, but among the sea of ordinary, cliche', and moe' there have been a few stand out series and movies.  Setting aside Summer Wars (which you should be watching if you haven't already...go on, I'll wait...) the rebuild of the Evangelion franchise is the crown jewel of what's going on in anime right now.

The first movie ""You Are (Not) Alone"" was excellent in of itself, functioning as a safe, yet gorgeous retelling of the first six episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion.  This follow up movie, ""You Can (Not) Advance"" is where the series takes a hard divergent turn from the original series.  In other media, this is often a recipe for disaster, but 2.22 makes the Eva franchise dance and tug on (if not pull out entirely) your heart strings for these characters.

For the first time since perhaps when I first watched Akira so long ago, I sat up on the edge of my seat as this film came to its finale'.  The best thing I can say about the rebuild series is that if you have no experience with Eva up until now, you're in for a very cool viewing experience.  If you're an old school fan of the series, the pay off for you may be even better.

(if you ARE one of those old school fans, look up some of the discussion that theorizes that the Rebuild series may in fact be a sequel, see how people rejected that theory and then came back around to it with the release of this film, fun stuff there)",1302134400,,1446,4.349442379182156
4326492,4,B004CCNB58,"Continuing the Rebuild Of Evangelion movie franchise, Evangelion 2.0(or Evangelion 2.22 as shown on the video release)is the second of a 4-part series that remakes the original Neon Genesis Evangelion anime, but adds alot of new twists and elements to make this a totally seperate entity from the TV show.

The sequal starts out with us being introduced to the brand new character of Mari Makinami, who is the pilot of Eva Unit-05, plus the resident meganekko. She tangles with the zombified remains of the 3rd Angel(the first Angel in movie #1)comes back to life, which results in the total destruction of Unit-05 and one of the numerous NERV bases. Cut to Japan where the 7th Angel is attacking Tokyo-3, but is defeated by the timely arrival of Capt. Asuka and Unit-02. Asuka ends up moving in with Shinji in Misato's apartment, where we're treated to a very fanservish-retake of Shinji's discovery of Pen Pen. Shinji is introduced to Misato's ex-boyfriend Kaji, who in secret delivers a mysterious package to Gendo. The 8th Angel then attacks from orbit, and all three Eva units work together to stop it from bellyflopping on NERV headquarters. Asuka actually takes a turn for the different at this point in the story as she starts to opening up to Shinji, and even Rei, more proven with the poignant elevator scene where they both realize they have alot more in common than before. Rei tries to arrange a dinner meeting between Shinji and his father, and invites most of the NERV regulars. Asuka politely declines to be the test pilot for Unit-03, although it gets possessed by the 9th Angel. With Asuka trapped inside, Unit-03 stomps its way to NERV. Unlike in the TV series where Shinji wouldn't attack the evil Eva because he can't bring himself to kill another person(even though at the time he didn't know it was his friend Toji), he realizes that Asuka is in it, and refuses to stop Unit-03. Gendo pulls a supreme act of dickery by switching Unit-01 to automatic mode with a dummy system, and it tears the crap out of Unit-03, even more than it really needed to. I mean, did it really need to chomp the entry plug with Asuka in it? The Angel was already dead by then! Anyway, Shinji quits just as the 10th Angel appears, and Mari counterattacks inside Unit-02 as Asuka is still in recovery. Even going into ""beast mode"", Mari can't stop it. Rei appears in the still-damaged Unit-00 and tries to shove a nuke down the Angel's throat, but the Angel devours Rei in Unit-00, and then mutates into being part giant naked Rei(shades of End Of Evangelion?). Mari happens to find Shinji, and carries him in Unit-02 to Unit-01. After being bruised, Unit-01 ascends into a higher lifeform, and plows through the metaphysical mush of the Angel to bring Rei out. Now, at this point, the movie looks like its going to end with Unit-01 bringing about a premature 3rd Impact, but if you stay to the end of the closing credits, Kaworu comes down from the moon in Unit-06 and spears Unit-01 with what is supposed to be several Lance of Longinus, which puts the brakes on 3rd Impact, as least for now.

There's alot more progress made in this film in the story and characters than in the original TV series. Asuka seems to have a less traumatic past, and opens up alot more. In other words, Asuka is less of a b-i-t-c-h! Shinji has gained more confidence than in the first movie, but withouth getting all cocky as he seemed to in the series. Rei is less introverted, and shows more than just her ""motherly"" concerns toward Shinji. The addition of Mari was mostly unnecessary, as the character didn't add too much more to the movie that couldn't have been filled in by any of the rest of the cast, but it is possible that it was done to set her up for a more important role in the next two movies. The animation in this is of course far better than the original anime, especially in the Eva fights. Asuka's ""Rider Kick"" entrance is pure gold! The dub is still pretty good too, with Tiffany Grant returning as Asuka, and the same from the first movie's English cast. Unlike the initial release of Evangelion 1.0, Funimation went ahead in did the Evangelion 2.22 release with the bonus features included, instead of just the regular 2.0. If you can stand to wait the extra 3-4 years it'll take to catch the rest of the new Eva movies, then you'll want to grab Part Two.",1302048000,,4358,4.60025706940874

The new Eva pilot Mari was a nice infusion of energy to the story. The slight change in Rei was refreshing(not a robot). Shinji finally becomes a man. I was literally in tears at the end.

4326495,5,B004CCNB58,"I have been waiting for this movie forever, and it did not disappoint in the least. I was most eager to hear Tiffany Grant reprise her role as Asuka as I am a big fan, and that alone was worth it. But the movie as a whole was so far beyond what I expected (and I expected a lot, I mean c'mon, its EVANGELION!). The visual effects are excellent, and the story line was brilliant.
Though a little hesitant at first, I quickly warmed up to the new character, Mari, played very well in English by Trina Nishimura (I have yet to watch the Japanese sub). Sorry Trina, you did very well, but Asuka is still my fav ^_^. The character developments were very fresh as well. I was very happy that Shinji manned up in this one. His actions were justified and I actually wanted to root for him. Asuka was Asuka just as I'd hoped, yet she seems slightly more emotional than the original series, which gave her a slightly more ambiguous and somewhat new persona. And lastly, Rei acutally smiles more than once! I know, I cant believe it myself.
All in all, one of the greatest movies, not just animes, Ive ever seen. It jerked every nerve. I laughed, I cried, I was left speechless. The last time that happened was during The End Of Evangelion.
An instant classic, worth watching. Bring on number 3!!!",1301788800,,1286,4.384937238493724

4326497,5,B004CCNB58,"I was anticipating this ever since I saw Evangelion 1.01. And when I finally got the chance to watch it, I was blown away. The action hits hard and fast right from the beginning with the epic battle between Mari and the skeletal Third Angel. The rest of the movie bears almost no resemblance to the original series, other than the characters themselves. Mr. Anno has taken his already landmark series and turned it into a true masterwork. I normally watch a movie once, gush over it for a few days to a week and then put it on the shelf. Not only do I still need to get through all of the extras, but I am going to watch it again as soon as I get the chance! The voice acting, while not top-notch was still very well-done, and the animation was beautiful. The climactic battle between Unit-01 and the Tenth Angel had me glued to my seat... it was so spectacular that it demanded all of my attention, so huge and epic that it allowed room for nothing else. There is only one gripe that I have, and it is this: now that I have seen something so good, I have to wait on pins and needles for 3.33.",1301788800,,1093,4.184834123222749
4326498,5,B004CCNB58,"Let me start out by saying that this film is just incredible. Dare I say...perfect? Yes I'd go as far as to call it the quintessence of perfection. I was absolutely blown away watching this. When a film can leave you feeling the same emotions of excitement and thrill that riding a roller coaster gives you, you know you're either crazy or it's just that GOOD. Hopefully it's the latter rather than the former. But being completely serious...this film is just ASTOUNDING in it's own right.

The film starts off right where the last one (Evangelion 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone) ends, but in truth it skips episode 07 of the televised series so episode 08 and continues from there to episode 19. Now since this film was released I've picked up the first film mentioned above and loved it, it was enough for me to pre-order Evangelion 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance and also purchase the complete original series. What this film brings to the table is a mix of some new and refreshing plot with a mix of the classic Neon Genesis Evangelion storyline which isn't a bad thing. The film weaves the new story it's trying to tell with the old and does so in a way that makes it feel familiar while still being new and just as exciting.

There's several additions to the Evangelion universe that they add in the film. One such addition is the new Eva pilot Mari who makes a great addition at that. The best way to describe her is well...crazy, but a good crazy she's just a blast to watch piloting and the scenes that do include her feel upbeat and fun. Let's just say she enters the story with a bit of a bang. Also the film changes some aspects that were pivotal in the series. For instance several new Eva's enter in the film while still being true to the series. The film also introduces Asuka Langley Shikinami, her surname changed from Soryu for some reason, but it's never clear why. Other than that not much changes between the main pilots from the original series which are: Shinji, Asuka, and Rei. The only exception is Toji is no longer selected as a pilot, which you'll later see why. Asuka is still the same old self-centered person who can't be honest with herself and her feelings, Shinji still needs a reason(s) to pilot the Eva and deal with his father complex, and Rei is still a mystery in her own right who needs help feeling emotions in my opinion. Between those 3 just like in the original show you have the tsundere (love hate) relationship between Asuka towards Shinji and the underlying relationship between Shinji and Rei the latter of which is more emphasized in this film rather than in the series where you have a lot of attention being focused on Asuka and Shinji.

There's some minor changes to the film as well with the enemies or Angels that they face off against. For instance in the series the episode 09 ""Both of You, Dance Like You Want to Win!"", where you have Asuka and Shinji working together to take out an angel that has the ability to separate it's core into two. Instead you have a somewhat similar ending to the fight in the way that the Eva attacks the lone Angel which does not split it's core and looks completely different from what the series depicted. But you also have some similar Angels such as an Angel attempting to crush Nerv HQ by dropping itself from orbit which would vaporize Tokyo-III. Other than that there isn't much change to the Angels they face except for the last one before the film ends. There's a lot that feels new to this film that makes it stand out while still retaining the original NGE story feel.

Another great aspect of the film is the voice acting, now I've watched the original series in the English dub and really liked the voices. A few have changed and some aren't for the better such as Kaji's voice which in my opinion doesn't suit him at all. But those that are present a lot in the film such as the pilots, their voice acting is spot on. The actors really came through with delivering each line making the full emotion they're trying to portray evident in the way they inflict each line. This ties into what I said about it being a roller coaster thrill ride to watch because the actors carry you through the film with such emotion that it gets you excited, or makes you feel whatever each particular scene is trying to convey.

Now the film itself is also in my opinion just completely beautiful. The colors, the artwork, the environments, heck even watching an Evangelion run through the city is just amazing to watch. And I mean that last part, watching the simple animation of an Evangelion running was just spectacular. And it should be the development for these films is top notch and a great and honest homage to the series that it rebuilds.

So from here my suggestion to you would be check it out or do a little digging and see for yourself. FUNimation has a channel on YouTube where they've posted about 8 clips of Evangelion 2.22 in HD of certain scenes in the movie. I've watched all of them and they range from anywhere to 2 minutes to 9 minutes. Even still you won't be spoiling much watching those, they really give you a sense of what the film has to offer without spoiling the plot. I still was surprised as to what happens even after watching Clip 6 *hint* *hint* it almost made me cry...really. Heck you can even purchase the first film Evangelion 1.11 in Blu-ray for around $10. If you do and you like that one then you'll absolutely love this. Period.

Final words...this film is worth it to any long time standing Neon Genesis Evangelion fan for what it offers and what it does for the series. I personally feel as though I'm watching the televised series for the first time all over again as a kid (or really the full series about a month ago). The film has some minor changes but just enough to make it feel original but yet familiar at the same time. It really invokes a senses of nostalgia. The artwork, animation, voice acting, plot, everything about this film is just spectacular. I would recommend it to anyone even if you're not a fan, I think it'd be enough to turn you into one. So that's my say on the film.",1301788800,,6113,4.462432915921288
4326499,5,B004CCNB58,"Before I go further let me answer the question, ""Is this really worth buying if I own/love the original series?"" The answer is YES! Absolutely yes.

I'm old enough to have seen the original series via bootleg VHS fansub (the good ole days) and while it had it's issues (depressing last quarter of the series, Shinji's bipolar personality etc) I can say this takes everything that was great (major plot points, characters, battles) and compresses the info, re-imagines it and tosses out the fluff and filler. Shinji is less annoying and more headstrong, the angles are more deadly and the action is animated so well it will make you wish all anime was up to this new level of quality.

The only thing that I didn't really like, and I never did, is the 'fan service' or ""showing partially nude teenage kids to appease the teen boy fans"" always has and will creep me out a little. Thankfully there is very little of it.

SPOILER: There are many plot changes, character arc differences and elimination of certain people and even events. That said the HD soundtrack and picture quality plus story make this a must have for fans of Eva or anime in general.

Now Evangelion 1.11 was a pretty good remake, you know better looking and such, the only major difference was the last Angel in that one which was awesome. But when watching Evangelion 2.22 I went crazy for this anime all over again! My jaw was dropped for so much of it. This is definitely not the same as the original version, only a little bit of the storyline goes the same way.  I watched a lot of youtube videos of some clips of the movie but seeing them in the movie and with the storyline made them so much better. This is by far my favorite anime movie so far. The only thing that I would complain about the movie though would be how much they show off the girls and such. I mean it wasn't showing as much nudity and such as the original version, but still. It feels really uncomfortable when they're showing off stuff on a 14 year old girls body. I'm 18 and that just creeps me out. But atleast it isn't as bad as the Original as I said. As a side note my dvd case was in it's wrapping and such, but the sleeve for the dvd case had some worn edges on it which was kinda weird too me since it was new.

4326504,5,B004CCNB58,"Finally, after two years of waiting, ""Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance"" finally comes to the states! And I have to say: IT WAS GLORIOUS!!! Once again, Hideaki Anno creates a visual feast of filmaking in the world of anime. For those of you who don't know about it, I'll give you the skinny. Anno created ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" in 1995 and it ended with the film ""The End of Evangelion"" in 1997. Once the series and films came to the states, it became a worldwide sensation sparking international debate and making significant changes to how anime producers develop anime. ""Rebiuld of Evangelion"", the grab-all term for the new four film series, is an attempt to enchance and reimagine the original work with what Anno calls ""an eye towards the future"".

STORY: The story of ""2.22"" is one that will leave you wanting more. I know it did for me. The characters are all fighting against the Angels in an attempt to protect their world from the Third Impact. If you've watched ""1.11"", you'll be at an advantage and will understand the story. For those of you who haven't, you're gonna end up lost without watching it.

PRESENTATION: Once again, studio Khara has done a phenomenal job of upgrading EVA to the next generation. The animation is beautifully detailed and fluid, and the environment look alive and fresh. Every nook and cranky is filled to the brim with detail. Even the CGI animation blends into the handrawn aspects. The harmony of 2D and 3D is so amazing that it almost rivals Stuido Ghibli.

DUB: Now this is were most of you fans are the most anxious. ""How does the dub sound?"" Well, Funimation does not dissapoint with their dub. The voices all match perfectly and the dialogue feels fresh and natural. Some may be put off by the swearing in the film, I'm looking at you Mari, but it's really a minor thing.

FINAL VERDICT: All in all, ""Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance"" is a beautiful film that does not dissapoint it's audience. Both old and new fans will enjoy it and I highly recommend it to any anime fan.",1301529600,,2038,4.637119113573407

The graphics are fantastic and the music is great.  Just wish it wasn't two years in between each installment :(",1301443200,,637,3.9296875

The colors, the audio, the revamp of the story! And the Battles!!!! Totally worth the money to watch, Order NOW!",1301356800,,288,4.5576923076923075
4326507,4,B004CCNB58,"Incredible movie. I've viewed it a couple times subbed previously, but with Evangelion I much prefer the dub... viewing 2.22 this time around felt like an entirely new experience!

The only fault I can find with this release is the packaging. I much prefered the packaging of the US release of 1.11, wish they would've kept with that style. That said, the new style isn't bad, but the actual quality of the packaging is a little on the cheap side.",1301356800,,447,4.5875
4326508,5,B004CCNB58,"Two years since the U.S. release of Evangelion 1.11 and now we finally have the release of Evangelion 2.22. For those who don't know yet, this movie is the 2nd of 4 movies making the Tetralogy of ""Rebuild of Evangelion"". This movie is a basically a retelling of episodes 7-19 from the original series but instead of minor changes like in the first movie, this movie is a COMPLETE retelling of the series episodes ultimately heading towards a brand new direction in the story. All the scenes in this movie are not replicated from the original series but rather inspired from the TV show. Major changes in the story include a new pilot named Mari from the Euro branch of nerv. While some Angels return, most are completely disbanded and replaced with a few new ones. This movie runs for about 2 hours and I have to say that this is one of the most beautiful Anime's I have ever seen, I cannot imagine what the last 2 movies will be like.

Like I have mentioned before, this movie is a retelling of the series. Familiar scenes from the original series are present and fans of the Eva series will notice them right away, however severely changed in both tone and outcome of each situation. For example the scene where Asuka and Shinji are in bed together was originally Asuka sleep walking and accidently ends up in his bed, but in this movie Asuka voluntarily goes to Shinji and has a little pep talk with him, those little differences can drastically change the meaning and perception of the scene. The Major thing I noticed in this movie that differs from the series is the interactions between characters; in my opinion all the characters in the movie get along rather well, especially the relationship between Asuka and Shinji. All characters seem less insane and more focused, I actually prefer this change of pace and I'm actually loving the chracters more now. However, all characters still act basically the same, Shinji is still the shy one, Rei is still the secrative one, Asuka is still the same outgoing showoff (but actually less bitchy). Misato is actually the one that has changed the most, she is a much stronger character in the movie adaption and less confused probably because she no longer has a love interest in Kaji. The movie's progression is a bit fast pace but doesn't feel rushed at all, and that is a very good thing because while only a 2 hour movie, they have managed to cram everything perfectly. I am not going to spoil anything about the plot of the movie but I will say that I cannot wait till te next movie. Although this movie still has its dark and emotional side that made this series infamous, there is a great deal of comic releif that I absolutely love.

NOW for the DVD itself. The important aspect of this release for me was the English Dub and how they have executed it. The one thing that dissapointed me with the release of Evangelion 1.11 was the English dub; I was pretty satisfied with it actually, however I could not overlook the laziness of some of the voice actors most specifically the actors for Shinji (Spike Spencer) and Misato (Allison Keith). These are the veteran actors from the original dub released by ADV films and while as a fan I am greatful that these 2 reprised their roles however in the last movie they seemed a bit uninspired, but I can't blame them since its been a while since these guys voiced these characters. BUT I am glad to say that in this movie Allison Keith and Spike Spencer have finally found their way back to the hearts of the characters and it feels at home again. Tiffany Grant has also reprised her role as Asuka and I'm finding the same problems with her as well but she is still as fiesty as ever and its just nice to hear her voice again, I can't imagine anybody else doing Asuka. This DVD has a more extras than the last release and that is a MAJOR improvement because Evangelion 1.11 had no extras whatsoever and I am a little confused on why they released it as a 2 disc in the first place. The packaging of this DVD is a bit different than the last relase as well, this DVD comes with a Slip through cover and the texture of the orange cover is pretty cool. The DVD comes with a 20 page booklet (similar to the last DVD) and if you ask me, thats where the real extras lie. The purchase of the DVD is well worth the 20 page booklet that comes with it. I am also glad that there is audio commentary available as well, the director interviews the major cast of the film and their perspectives of the new movies and the creative process behind the dubbing. The only complaint I have is that the 2nd disc (ONCE AGAIN) lacks any real extras that provide true insight behind the movie, but at least the commentary is a bit more informative but I just wished they talked more about he film itself and less about themselves .Evangelion 2.22 is well worth the purchase, it is one of the most technically outstanding animes I have ever witnessed so far and everybody should see it.",1301356800,3,4962,4.469680264608599
4326509,3,B004CCNB58,"I decided to write a review to describe how disappointed I was with the packaging of this Blue-ray. (-1 star) 1.11 came with a beautiful box, vs. this tacky orange slip cover. As a collector, the packaging really ruined this purchase for me. In a way it is a bit ironic, considering 1.11 was a disappointment for me, due to it's repetitiousness reanimation of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion series. Hidaeki Anno actually took a little directorial liberty and added to the plot in this 2.22 remake. The irony is in the cheap packaging of the better product. From a business stand point FUNimation made the call to cut some corners and save a little money on packaging, which probably helped lower the retail price, but from a collectors standpoint, putting these products side by side seems a little pointless. I'm sure years from now after the next movie is released, a collectors edition will be released and solve this gripe, but for now it makes me wonder why I needed to buy this product. How about buying this product to keep FUNimation in Business? Well it's argument enough for me to buy the next movie too, but still I can't help but laugh when I put the two products side by side.

I'll also comment on the English Voice acting in this series. (-1 star) I constantly had to keep switching back to the Japanese to see how much liberty they were taking and it was considerable. Plus, as usual the English voice acting was just bland and lacked the well executed mannerisms that the Japanese voice actors always seem to do so much better. Other than that the animation, music, new Angels, addition plot and characters all make this title worth purchasing. As for the die hard NGE fans, you will probably see this remake as being for simple minded Hollywood action oriented viewers. In it's defense the explosions are spectacular!

4326510,5,B004CCNB58,"If you're an Eva fan, you don't want to miss this one. Check out a different review for a plot synopsis.

The packaging is really nice, the orange slipcover opens up to reveal Unit 02 and it has a very nice texture. However, the slipcover edges are prone to chipping, so handle with care.

As for the film itself, the Blu-ray picture and audio quality is on par with 1.11, so it's a real treat for the eyes and ears.

It's up to personal taste, but if you like English dubs, chances are you won't be disappointed by this one. There are a few creative liberties taken, but they help to enhance the dub experience. The actors are in top form, especially the main returning cast, which says a lot because I never liked the dub of the original show.

The majority of the extras in this set are nice, but the 2.22 trailers and TV spots really aren't all that interesting and seem like they were added for the extra bulk. The 2.02 featurette is pretty neat and the for deleted scenes are definitely worth a look. The commentary track bored me to death, but I'm really not a fan of commentaries to begin with, so if you are, you might find something there.

All in all, this is a near-perfect release of a really awesome movie, so do yourself a favor and buy it.",1300579200,6,1255,4.3008474576271185

4326512,5,B004CCNB58,"To understand truly how great this film is you should watch the original TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion which this Tetralogy is based on. The differences and improvements to the characters may seem subtle, but in a 2 hour film those differences are magnified compared to a 26 episode series which had a lot of time to develop characters.

That being said the animation, CG, lighting, etc are incredible and I can't remember seeing anime action look so incredible in a long time. I watched the English subtitled version of this film and voice acting and subtitles where fine, don't know about the English dub but the voice actors are supposed to be the same from the TV series so they probably did a fine job.

Also in case you don't know this is the 2nd out of 4 films, so if you haven't seen the 1st film you will be lost and be prepared to want more once the film is over. This film I will recommend to anyone regardless of a preference to anime or not, this is a great sci-fi, action, and drama mixed together. I will make my friend who was angry by the ending that the TV series left us with watch this because it improves and clarifies the story the second time around.

The TV series in the end failed to tie everything together, still the TV series ranks in my Top 5 TV series ever. I can only hope the films complete the story. But judging by the first 2 films I would have to say they are right on track.",1300233600,38,1416,4.276119402985074

UPDATE: I had only seen the movie when I wrote the above. I now own the DVD and can say it is pretty great. The packaging, while not as elaborate as 1.11, is very nice. The extras are not amazing, but there is some cool stuff in there. Still a 5 star product.",1299628800,2,556,3.793103448275862

4326516,5,B004CCNB58,"For those who don't know, the Rebuild of Evangelion series is a four-part theatrical remake of the infamous anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. Evangelion was a deconstruction of the Giant Robot genre. The original series was very much love it or hate it. The polarizing issues ranged from the characters' notorious pyscholgical problems, to the confusing final two episodes, to the show's use of rather horrific imagery, peppered with pieces of Christian and Kabbalistic symbolism, resulting in one of the most brutal, influential, and controversial examples of Anime. I liked the original series, but I was fully aware of its flaws, and I considered it to be a flawed masterpiece.

Now onto Rebuild of Evangelion. Evangelion 1.0 sums up the first 6 episodes, with the continuity changed slightly, and the Angel fights given a massive makeover. I enjoyed it very much, and while it is very similar to the original, it sets the stage for Evangelion 2.0.

Now as for Eva 2.0...
IT. IS. AMAZING! This film seriously ranks among my all time favorite movies. It fully brings the Rebuild series into its own. It composes of roughly episodes 7-19. This results in many of the Angel fights being cut, but a couple new Angels are added as well, but the timing feels well-paced. It also addresses the show's polarizing aspects. The infamously broken characters are given some well placed adjustments. For example, Asuka in the original was known for being a rather narcissitic bitch with a very traumatic childhood. But in Eva 2.0, some of her more redeeming qualities are shown. The second half the the movie drastically alters the continuity with the original show, revealing that Rebuild will truly shine as its own work, instead of just remaking the original. I don't want to spoil anything, but after seeing this you will have a newfound respect for our hero, everyone's favorite whiner, Shinji Ikari. The ending is one of those rare combinations of heartwarming and terrifying, with a helping of badass. Compare that to the original ending, which was notoriously confusing, or the concluding movie End of Evangelion, which was just plain terrifying.

I recommend this to all Anime fans, but especially to those who've seen the original, whether they liked it or not. An absoloutly mind-blowing experience.",1296172800,298,2297,5.055408970976253

Conversely you can not advance stays true yet departs from the original series in a way that is incredibly appealing, fresh, and innovative. I watched 5 times in a three day period.

While I was initially suspicious of the new Rebuilds, I have been pleasantly surprised. I was given the opportunity to see Eva 2.0 on the big screen last night, and I was beyond impressed. However, the quality of that screening was quite poor (it was almost like a fansub), and I'm eager for this blu-ray version.

I have one small quibble with this chapter of the Rebuild, and for people completely unfamiliar with the series, this will be a  VERY SMALL SPOILER, so you've been warned.

My beef is with the new pilot exclusive to the Rebuild: Mari Illustrious Makinami. While very cool, she feels completely tacked on, and not integrated well into the plot at all. She comes in, says some funny things, fights, and then...nothing. She's just a distraction. A mildly entertaining distraction, but an awkward one as well. If she was excised from the movie, it would not affect the story in any way, shape or form. I'm sure she'll become more important in 3.0, but for now...thumbs down.

The Eva Rebuild movies (the series this is a part of) is a completly different experience to the original TV series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and it will make a lot less sense if you don't watch it first.

With that out of the way, Evangelion 2.22 is an excellent film. It does a great job of adapting the original anime seriesband setting up for the next movie, Evangelion 3.0. It says fresh with some controversial new additions while still largely staying true to the original, as opposed to 1.11 which felt like a rehash of the anime without adding anything worthwhile.

Evangelion 2.22 is quite possibly my favorite piece of Eva media so far, and is definitely worth a watch. Just make sure you watch NGE and 1.11 first",1519257600,,1001,4.780346820809249
