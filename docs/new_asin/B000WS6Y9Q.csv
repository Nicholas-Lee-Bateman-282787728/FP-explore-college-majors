2990495,5,B000WS6Y9Q,"In 2005 Evo Morales made history by becoming Bolivia's first ever indigenous president nearly 500 years after the Spanish Conquest. ""Cocalero"" chronicles Morales' campaign to become president and it is a great story of a man facing impossible odds, fierce social obstacles and a nation at the breaking point after years of upheaval. Director Alvaro Garcia Lineras takes us deep into Morales' campaign, making this a fascinating, informative film to watch during this intense election season, here we see that American politics even at the worst look tame and cordial compared to what candidates face in Latin America. Morales was not just running for President, he was defying an old order that ran the country with a system that can only be deemed apartheid, as the nation's indigenous majority suffered hundreds of years of abuse by a white minority. We see Morales giving stump speeches, attending rallies, and facing racist attacks when entering an airport. There are great scenes where see Aymara indians training themselves to vote and finding ways to get around a lack of education and illiteracy to make their voice heard. The film's title is taken from the coca farmers, who grow the leaf from where the drug cocaine is produced, but here we learn about how this leaf has been traditionally grown for multiple uses, even toothpaste and is chewed by the indians in the same way you would drink coffee to wake up for the day. Lineras magnificently captures these and other indigenous traditions, educating the viewer on a world most Americans have no idea exists. The story of Morales also gives us a glimpse of the social conditions and discrimination that have led the masses to choose the Left in the region, we see Evo at a rally with Hugo Chavez where they send free trade agreements to hell and hear frightening stories, including one where Evo recalls watching an indian being tortured and burned alive as a small boy. ""Cocalero"" is a great political story and human drama, it has an exciting narrative and a heartfelt message about equality that few American political specials ever capture. As we debate here which candidates are more likeable and which candidate you can see yourself having a beer with, here is Evo Morales fighting tooth and nail with his indigenous people to take the power back after centuries of neglect. ""Cocalero"" tells a great story with universal appeal.",1201824000,,2396,4.962686567164179

""Cocaleros"" has some shots of Bolivia that are just beautiful, and the soundtrack of original music is sensational; and I thoroughly enjoyed the ways it represents indigenous people who were largely exterminated here in the US, and face vicious discrimination in South America.  There are moments in the film where Morales is called a ""f-ing Indian.""
So, it was wonderful to see Morales win, and this film does a great job of honoring that historic achievement.

Many films are being produced that will help US citizens overcome their insularity and sense of superiority.  It's a shame this sort of enlightening and humane movie isn't aired on stations like NBC, but Link TV and Sundance do air perception-expanding films like ""Cocaleros.""
I would also recommend the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Corporation/dp/B0007DBJM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Corporation</a>&nbsp;which features a segment on Bolivia's struggle to control their water resources, and also outlines the problems the entire world faces from massive corporate power.
Wikipedia also has an interesting write-up on Morales, who said, ""The worst enemy of humanity is U.S. capitalism.  That is what provokes uprisings like our own, a rebellion against a system, against a neoliberal model, which is the representation of a savage capitalism.  If the entire world doesn't acknowledge this reality, that the national states are not providing even minimally for health, education and nourishment, then each day the most fundamental human rights are being violated.""",1201392000,8,3601,6.50836820083682

The filmmaker's access to Evo Morales and some of his supporters and allies provides a window into a political process that is both organic and extremely organized and hierchal. The power of community organization seems to outshine education, money, even ideology. The film also shows us the lives of women and men who live off of coca production, whose business has become more profitable as a result of the US crackdown on cocaine production. This relative profitability is also a powerful political tool to rally farmers behind this canditate.

8225373,5,B000WS6Y9Q,We needed this for a Spanish class and found it very informative.  I came away with a feeling like I was really there. The producer really knows what he is doing. I give it a thumbs up.,1362355200,,185,4.0
8225374,3,B000WS6Y9Q,"This is an important documentary and historical document, since it has extraordinary footage of Evo Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia.  The film follows Evo during the presidential campaign and seems to truly have unlimited access to him and his followers.  However, the film is hampered by unnecessarily ""artistic"" camerawork and lack of narration.

I watched this documentary without much background information on Morales and was mainly interested in learning more.  Although I learned some, I feel that if there had been more background given, I would have learned a lot more than I did.

I especially felt that the lack of context and narration was simply wrong-headed when they showed footage of what seems to be a massacre of coca workers.  Why not explain what was happening?  I think that people that already know a great deal about Morales and Bolivia will find this documentary fascinating, but that those who are just looking to learn more are likely to be a bit frustrated, as I was.",1308787200,2,1013,4.994047619047619

Instead, I got a neutral (about as neutral as a filmmamker covering a campaign could get) look at the rise of leftist leader in one of the poorest countries in South America.

This film is a starting point to stimulate the interest of anyone who scratches their head and wonders what the shift to the left in Latin America is partly about, and why it happens.",1244073600,9,481,4.5813953488372094

8225378,4,B000WS6Y9Q,"This is a documentary recorded with a hand held camcorder and the takes are necessarily shaky, I advise the viewer to take some Dramamine 20-30 minutes before viewing. But it is a deeply authentic and intimate depiction of Mr. Evo Morales' personality, his values, ambitions, and of his constituency. Ethnic backgrounds aside, as americans, from the Patagonia to Alaska, we should all celebrate the election of an american indian to the presidency of Bolivia and embrace him. All indians in the Americas have been excluded for far too long from participating in..., well, everything. History demonstrates we have been very bigoted and very unfair to american indians since the arrival of the espa&ntilde;oles. This a humble means to bring a big message to everyone.

8225379,4,B000WS6Y9Q,"Move over War Room, James Carville and Bill Clinton, and make way for Cocalero, a new political documentary featuring highlights of the triumphant Presidential campaign of Evo Morales, a Bolivian Indian and leader of Andean coca growers' union.

The film sets out to do two things: first, to highlight Morale's campaign and portray him in the most charming way possible, and, secondly, to show the plight and dignity of the Andean Indians whose crusade against coca eradication has made them a cause clbre among anti-American activists throughout the world- including the U.S. It succeeds on both levels even as it avoids an enlightening, non-partisan look at the consequences and rationales behind the anti-coca campaign.

The makers of Cocalero were given terrific access to Morales and you can't help but come away liking him. You see Morales campaigning down bustling city streets, stumping for votes in dirt-poor native farming communities, gamely spinning gotcha journos on television, and waxing eloquently from the podium before throngs of supporters. All the while, you're struck by his low-keyed personality. This is not the kind of populist leader we've come to expect. Morales is certainly charming and possesses a great sense of humor, but his manner is quite often underscored, and, at times reserved. He bears almost no resemblance to his bombastic, ideological partners Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro.

In addition to Morales, the filmmakers spend quite a bit of time with Leonilda Zurita, a rural candidate for Senate living in a thatched roofed shelter with no walls and no running water. At one point, Zurita leads fellow members of the women's coca union in chants: ""Viva Comrade Evo, Viva the coca leaf, death to the Yankees."" Typically I would have a bit of discomfort when hearing folks shout ""death to the Yanks"", but one look at the frailty of the assembled crowd and the jocular manner in which they hurl their chants make them seem more farcical than a threat.

The Zurita parts are fascinating. Here's a lady campaigning for Senate, one of Morales key politicos, and at one point in the film we see her apologize, as she offers a bowl of eggs to the camerman, that she ""wasn't able to catch the chicken."" At another, we watch Zurita as she helps bring in the harvest of the coca leaf.

Another interesting vignette shows off the PR skills of Adriana Gil, an attractive woman with traditional European looks who during the campaign worked as the spokesperson for Morale's political party, MAS. Gil is clearly a pleasant face and a strong spinmeister who was brought in to assuage the city people of St. Cruz who were mostly supporting the other candidate amid cries by Morales that he would try to expropriate land from those in cities who ""had too much,"" and give it to the farmers.

If you want to view firsthand a fascinating foreign political process at work amid some gorgeous and fascinating scenery, this documentary will be well worth your time. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a dispassionate conversation about American and Bolivian coca policy and the good and bad of American foreign policy, this one won't satisfy you.

Here's the trailer: [...]",1201910400,14,3193,4.9793621013133205
