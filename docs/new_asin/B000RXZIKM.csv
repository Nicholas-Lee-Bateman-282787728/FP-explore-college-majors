2876084,4,B000RXZIKM,"So far this has been the best DVD on Freemasonry that I've found.  As a Mason of course I wanted more and if they had more, I would still want more.  I have it as part of my library and would suggest it for any other Mason.",1222214400,5,223,3.723404255319149
2876085,5,B000RXZIKM,"Freemasonry Revealed is a three-part series presented on two DVDs.  The three parts in this series are:

The Leaders

The Legends

and, The Conspiracy.

Also, included on these DVDs is a bonus program ""Inside Freemasonry"".

The DVDs present the history of Freemasonry, introduce some of the most famous and well respected Freemasons throughout history, and discusses some of the conspiracy theories that claim Freemasons are secretly ruling the world.  Both prominent Freemasons, as well as non-Masons present their views throughout these DVDS, with both sides being given the opportunity to have their say, but in the end most of the conspiracies about Freemasonry are debunked.

If you are a Freemason, these DVDs offer a unique insight and introduction into many aspects of the Craft.  If you are not a Freemason, but have an interest in what goes on in the Lodge you will certainly gain some insight from these DVDs.

Well produced and presented, with a running time of 188 minutes.  A good addition to your Masonic library.",1191283200,31,1028,5.059523809523809

8202940,2,B000RXZIKM,"This is your avereage run of the mill dvd on all the conspiracy angled European Freemasonic lore. Nothing new here. I found it funny and odd that they would have A Prince Hall Mason say he was (so) but never had a word of dialogue about the Prince Hall Masons. Their mention of ancient Egypt was almost apologetic but in no way in depth. I would give it a 1 star but they did have a couple of woman Masons that had some what of an opinion.

They mentioned Napoleon was a Mason but didn't give any background on him, I was waiting thoughout for that. They seemed to concentrate on a side lodge p2 & it's conspiracy linked to the Pope's death in Italy. People are so hungry these days for Masonic info I guess this will do well in units sold.",1295049600,,740,4.174825174825175

8202942,3,B000RXZIKM,"If you are a Mason or a well versed, intelligent individual who has studied the craft, you will not learn much here.  Most of the people being interviewed are partially to extremely biased, being either Masons or non-Masons. True Historical research is missing here.

Don't get me wrong though, it is amusing and the production team did do a great job of walking the tight rope between conspiracy and history, mystery and fact but the truth is, their isn't much information one couldn't just conclude going on here.

If you need Masonry 101, read a book by Manly P. Hall or contact your local Lodge. They will be more than happy to speak with you. That is, in real terms, with real people and not in front of a movie camera!~",1227052800,8,725,4.519083969465649
