8200942,4,B000RIW2B0,"Many anime movies based on a TV series are basically like extremely long episodes, though often with with better animation and music.

And such is the case with the first movie based on the hit anime series, ""Bleach: Memories of Nobody."" It's not a perfect movie adaptation -- several regulars are reduced to brief cameos -- but it is graced with some extremely solid action sequences, lovely animation, a solid mix of comedy and tragedy, and a nice little storyline for the perpetually stressed-out Ichigo.

After disposing of a Hollow, Ichigo and Rukia encounter puffy creatures with pointed red heads. When the things start getting pushy, a strange Shinigami girl named Senna appears and wipes many of them out.

Turns out these things are Blank (amnesiac) souls from the Valley of Screams in the Severed World, and the only way to get rid of 'em is to find the Memory Rosary, a being that contains all their memories. As Ichigo struggles to keep an eye on the flighty Senna, he is charged with finding the Memory Rosary and protecting it from the mysterious man who is leading the Blanks.

Guess who the Memory Rosary is. I'll give you a hint: it's someone not in the regular cast.

Anyway, a bunch of Soul Reapers are dispatched to bring the Memory Rosary back with them, only to have her snatched away by a strange man named Ganryu, who has a grudge against the Soul Reapers. Ichigo and Rukia discover the portal into the Severed World -- but there's only an hour before the worlds of the living and the dead collide, with devastating results. And even with the help of all his Soul Reaper friends, Ichigo may not be able to prevail...

Anyone not familiar with Tite Kubo's ""Bleach"" series will probably be utterly lost during ""Memories of Nobody,"" especially given the vast cast of Good Guys who show up without introduction. The entire movie plays out like a very long anime filler episode, but with a lot more new characters, villains, and introducing an entire dimension between the Soul Society and the living world. And an accidental Ichigo-Kon kiss.

Fortunately ""Memories of Nobody"" does a good job preserving the flavor of the ""Bleach"" anime series. It starts off rather lightweight and a bit talk-heavy until Ganryu decides to show himself, leading into a clash between the Soul Reapers and his nasty little minions. Those rapid-fire battles are astounding -- quick, lethal and full of special powers (including Ichigo riding on Renji's zanpakuto). And the climax is simply spectacular -- a bloody savage duel between Ganryu and Ichigo on a vast leafless tree, even as the Severed World starts falling apart.

And the writers strike a good balance in ""Memories of Nobody"" -- we have acrobatic battles, flashy powers, a bit of Hollow-slaying, and some poignant moments for Ichigo and Senna. Fortunately amid all this serious stuff, there's some humor as well -- including a running gag about ambulance crews trying to resuscitate Ichigo's soulless body, which he has a bad habit of simply dropping any old place. I've always wanted to see that happen.

Even the animation has been souped-up here. It's a little more detailed and defined than animation for a weekly TV show, and there are some lovely visuals -- sprays of maple leaves, the nighttime lights of Karakura, and the explosive battles between Soul Reapers. And the soundtrack -- particularly the violin solo -- is simply lovely.

The characterization is one weak spot, though. Most of the main cast -- including Uryu, Chad, Orihime and all of Urahara's little gang -- are reduced to standing on a bridge waiting for Ichigo to come back. And somehow Ganryu is never quite compelling -- we never find out why he was exiled, or what motivations he has beyond wanting revenge on the Soul Society.

But this is a well-written story for Ichigo Kurosaki, -- his gruff, slightly awkward personality is captured beautifully, as well as his iron-clad determination to protect anybody he's become fond of. Senna is a character so completely flaky that she makes Orihime look like Eeyore, but she does manage to be likable and good-hearted despite that.

""Bleach: Memories of Nobody"" is not quite as good as it could have been, but it's a solid adventure for Ichigo and his assorted Soul Reaper friends. An entertaining, fast-paced little ride.",1220745600,,4307,4.868852459016393
8200943,3,B000RIW2B0,"Great movie for Bleach fans, with all the action and heart you'd expect.  Reading the other reviews, though, it makes sense that this could be a bootleg, given how lousy the subtitles are.  I kept thinking to myself as I was watching this that I could have done a heck of a lot better job, and I don't speak Japanese!

So, if this really is a bootleg copy of the movie, why is Amazon selling it or permitting it to be sold on its website? Isn't there a copyright issue here??  If I'd have known, I would have waited to buy the ""official"" version, with, I'm assuming, good subtitles.  I'd rather give my money to support Noriyuki Abe and the folks at Shonen Jump.

I'm disappointed!",1218153600,,681,4.365079365079365

8200945,3,B000RIW2B0,"Memories of Nobody (Noriyuki Abe, 2006)

The first thing to say about Memories of Nobody is that if you're not already a fan of the anime (or manga) Bleach, you're going to be lost almost immediately, and things will only get worse. If you're a fan and debating whether to see it, it shouldn't even be a question (though you should probably wait until you've finished the Soul Society story arc to check it out).

The downside: it's a ninety-minute episode of the show. This is the main reason non-fans will get lost; it assumes you've been following along and you know who all these folks are. It also takes kind of a ""family-reunion"" approach, in that everyone shows up a little, even the characters who aren't germane to the story, just so they could get some face time for the fans of the particular characters. It's a bare-faced attempt at making sure everyone who watches the series or reads the books will go to see the movie, and it's kind of annoying. (On the other hand, my favorite character is Chad, who wasn't germane to the story, and so only got the face time... you see my problem.)

The upside: it's a ninety-minute episode of the show, which means a lot of action, a lot of witty dialogue (though one wonders when they're going to get a translator who doesn't lapse into Engrish every two or three minutes, and why the English cast hasn't yet complained about it), and a lot of fun, and all of it more than what you can do on regular television. Some characters you probably thought you'd never see again after the conclusion of the Soul Society arc pop back in, which was fun. (And I'm still half-convinced Ron Perlman does the English voice for Kenpachi-- even more so now than I was when watching the series.) It also introduces a host of new characters and concepts, though since the movie is self-contained, you know what's coming from the first few moments, given that the anime has passed this point long before the movie was made. Can't change canon, etc.

I'd offer a plot synopsis, but it'll lose non-fans of the show as fast as the movie will. And if you're a fan, the new concepts would take more explaining than I have room for in a review (but are wonderfully explained by Urahara's trademark drawings). Suffice to say there was a great deal of laughter in the theater much of the time. I'd call it a success, with some reservations. It wasn't what it could have been, but what it actually was was very good. ***",1216339200,,2444,4.510158013544018
8200946,5,B000RIW2B0,"This was great, although it is in Japanese there are english subtitles.  The action and art work is awsome.  If you are a Bleach fan you need this!  I am not sure if they will be releasing in the US so you better grab it.  The movie takes place after the entry saga.  The soul society and ictigo are working together on this one!",1206403200,4,329,4.078125
