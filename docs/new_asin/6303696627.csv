7852822,5,6303696627,if your interested in the civil war these tapes should be in your collection!!!! I highly recommend them!!!,1424822400,,107,5.0
7852823,5,6303696627,"I don't believe they have made this series on dvd, I've looked every where. I think it's because of the Nathan Bedford Forrest episode on tape 6. I'm going to take it to the drug store and have it transferred to dvd, great for civil war buffs.",1374796800,,243,4.191489361702128
7852824,5,6303696627,"This is a fantastic series that ran for 52 episodes of which I recorded every one of. I cannot understand why the complete series has not been released in a DVD set. ""Civil War Journal"" ranks right up there with the Ken Burns Civil War series. Rather than being a chronological review of the war, each episode of ""Civil War Journal"" focuses on one particular event, personality, or topic. Hopefully the History Channel will some day release this series in its entirety",1285718400,2,468,4.719512195121951
7852825,4,6303696627,"This series has great content covering a wide range of different subjects, battles and individuals not always included in CW documentaries.  I recommend it for the video library of all Civil War buffs.
Even though I have watched all the shows I pull these off the shelf and watch them when I can't find anything else on TV.
At 45 minutes or so each show, you get a very detailed exploration into the episode's subject matter instead of the general overview you might find in other documentaries.
My only gripe and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the tapes.  I can't understand why a set costing what this one does would be taped at (EP) mode.  What a disappointment, content this good deserved better, and so do we when paying this much for a set like this.
Despite the quality issue, it is worth having because of the great narration, stories, photos, re-enacments etc.  Enjoy.",1039910400,5,900,4.571428571428571
7852826,5,6303696627,"The second Civil War Journal boxset picks up where the first ended, continuing with the same gripping narratives, excellent production values and attention to detail that lift this entire series head and shoulders above most documentaries.
Series two concentrates a bit more on personalities than battles, although not exclusively.  Featured in these 13 episodes are Robert E. Lee, William Tecumseh Sherman, Joshua L. Chamberlain, Frederick Douglas and Nathan Bedford Forest, alongwith the Battles of Fredericksburg and Chattanooga.  Once again, Danny Glover's understated narration adds the final polish to the production.
The most telling aspect of Box Set 2 is that there is no drop-off in quality from its predecessor.  Any American History or Civil War enthusiast will be delighted with this collection.
Very highly recommended.",998524800,9,833,5.648
