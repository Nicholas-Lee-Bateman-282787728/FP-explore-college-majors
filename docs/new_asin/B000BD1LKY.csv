2414012,5,B000BD1LKY,Brings back memories of when I was a kid watching the filming in my neighborhood.,1144454400,4,81,4.466666666666667
2414013,5,B000BD1LKY,"I used to think that ""Naked City"" was an antecedent of shows like ""NYPD Blue,"" but nothing could be further from the truth. What each show is is a reflection of the times in which they were made. Det. Flint is always probing the psychological motives of the suspects and people involved in a case, much to the exasperation of Lt. Parker. Det. Sipowicz usually assumed the guilt of someone they've brought in for questioning, and wasn't above roughing someone up or telling them something deceitful to get a confession, methods that would horrify Adam Flint.

Many ""Naked City"" episodes spend much of their time on the inner torment of the criminal, in keeping with the Kennedy-optimistic ""forward"" thinking of the time. Thus the guest stars are guys who were good at portraying twisted minds, like Robert Duvall and William Shatner. ""NYPD Blue"" is very victim-focused, with two-dimensional creeps and weirdos for bad guys, with punishment extracted seen as justice done.

""Naked City"" can come off as too earnest and idealistic, especially through Flint's character, but at least the motives are noble, and it's actually refreshing now to see such integrity.

The cast is terrific with Nancy Malone very attractive in a pert early-'60s way, very independent in her Broadway career and on a par with Flint as his gal, and often feeding him smart advice. It's a very believable relationship for the brief periods we see it. (The best is going to either of their apartments: It's a veritable catalog of mid-century modern design tips.)

From a pure viewing perspective, the NYC location shooting and overall cinematography is phenomenal, and on progressive-scan TV is so amazing you feel sad that such work could not be fully appreciated in its original airing, having been seem mostly on piss-poor B&W televisions averaging 19"" diagonal.

Music -- what can you say about the intersection of the Sinatra world here with themes and incidental music from Billy May and Nelson Riddle?

Stories, acting, cinematography, music -- each episode plays out like a short noir. Being in the early '60s, though, gives it that added ""anything seems possible"" earnestness and optimism even amid the grimness of the stories.

I've been getting every DVD as they came out (and even wrote to Image after the first release to encourage more), and I love the new bigger sets with the original commercials and station-ID interstitials.

To see the attempts of ad agencies to manipulate viewers 45 years ago is to see crude early stages of techniques that seem laughable now in their transparency. However, you can see the basis for manipulations done in more sophisticated ways today. Aside from that, they're just a riot!",1140307200,28,2699,5.008928571428571
2414014,5,B000BD1LKY,"OK, lest I sound with my raves like a paid PR man for the Naked City series, I am not.

For anyone interested in film noir, New York of the late 50's and 60's, and the early careers of some of our top actors today, this set of three DVDs is a must-have.

For those who don't know about Naked City, all the outdoor scenes were filmed on the streets of New York. It's a very different place than today with the series offering a realistic portrait of the sometimes raw, sometimes glorious city some 50 years ago.  (When I watched it when it was first shown on TV, I knew I had to move to New York as soon as I could...and I did.)

This DVD offers stunning performances by a host of actors, many of whom would later become stars including Jean Stapelton, Barbara Harris, Dan Duryea, Maureen Stapleton, and Barbara Barrie.  One of my favorites, Idylls of a Running Back, features ever wonderful Sandy Dennis and Aldo Ray. It's about a sensitive and pathetic young woman who goes too far with a football player she adores. He doesn't even know she exists.

Beyond the performances of these actors, you can't beat the ""regulars,"" Paul Burke and Nancy Malone. They are totally real, touching and ""New York.""

While you are on the time machine and transported back to New York, you will laugh and cry.  Don't miss it!",1137542400,23,1309,4.425
2414015,5,B000BD1LKY,"Item is as described. For those who are a fan of old, black & white ""film noir"" - type detective shows (without station/advertising breaks), this will fit your needs, at an affordable price.

I recommend this product!",1417910400,,217,4.864864864864865
2414016,5,B000BD1LKY,"I love this series, sad that it went only four seasons, but the big city life filmed right there in New York was great wish they do more of that, they sure do it here in Los Angeles.",1417305600,3,182,3.8157894736842106

2414018,5,B000BD1LKY,"Early TV did not offer as many shows as today.  The realism of the series at locations that we could identify made the series a must see.  Mom, Dad, and I  cuddled up on the couch to watch.  As a young actor, Naked City was my first TV gig as an extra.  Aldo Rae and Sandy Dennis were terrific live, and made a strong impression on me.  It was a great acting lesson for me.  It is hard work!",1398384000,,391,3.8734177215189876
2414019,4,B000BD1LKY,"Naked City was a police drama which foreshadowed the many law enforcement TV shows of the late '60s, 70s, & 80s.  Well scripted human life scenarios set in the Big Apple played to a nationwide audience with great success.",1389225600,2,221,4.666666666666667

2414021,4,B000BD1LKY,Stories quite good - brought me back into the early l960's which is a nice trip to nostalgia land for me.  I liked seeing back drops of New York City,1375315200,,149,3.966666666666667
2414022,5,B000BD1LKY,"When growing up in Brooklyn I watched Naked City. I missed a bunch if episodes when the Navy intervened, but still saw quite a few. It was the only show on TV that was filmed on location, and had a gritty real feeling. Nearly every crime show that followed in future years used Naked City as its model. It still holds up as a snapshot of New York in the 50s and early 60s. The movie which preceded it was almost like a pilot. It had most of the same cast too. I particularly remember a show that featured two unknown new actors. About a psychopathic Charles Starkweather type kid and his young girlfriend as they visited New York with devastating effect. Rip Torn and Tuesday Weld were the stars. The show had great acting in every episode and introduced many rising stars and famous actors. Worth watching today, and worth doing an updated version, but there are so many crime shows on TV it would probably not appeal, and they would probably screw it up. Seems like AMC is the only channel with some intelligent Crime series' (and I don't mean Zombie crime).",1340841600,,1060,4.469072164948454
2414023,5,B000BD1LKY,"This one-of-a-kind series from the 60s would not enthrall viewers who thrive on wild car chases and other such action. ""Naked City"" is a crime drama that focuses not so much on crime, but on the minds and backgrounds of the criminals and of those cops just trying to do their jobs. This simple premise sounds pretty dull when compared to today's crime dramas that hold nothing back and uses techniques that are far more sophisticated than of yore. I happen to be a fan of classic television ""noir"" and what makes ""Naked City"" a particular favorite of mine is its gritty realism addressing the issues of people trying to survive in the urban jungle of New York City. Like ""East Side West Side"" starring George C. Scott, another intelligent and innovative drama series of that era, ""Naked City"" is filmed in the shadowy glow of black and white and right on location. There are few glamorous Park Avenue backdrops here; instead, there are slum neighborhoods and public housing projects, airshafts and flowing garbage cans and back streets, testimony to what it's really like to live un-rich in New York City, as true then as it is today. Most important, the series boasts of an excellent cast of regulars and an array of costars that breathe life into the characters they portray; anyone interested or involved in drama/theater will get a real acting lesson here. Furthermore, if you watch this series and find it's not your cup of tea, the blood-bubbling jazz score that is ""Naked City's"" theme will have you coming back for more!

I was especially fascinated witnessing early ""just starting out"" performances of some of today's most respected stars. Allegedly, many of these actors were at that time were making names for themselves on the Broadway stage. An episode entitled ""And By the Sweat of Thy Brow"" features one such actor, a very young Richard Jordan (Woody Allen's ""Interiors"" and ""The Life of Molly Dodd"" fame). Jordan portrays a lonely, homeless young man so ashamed of his badly-scarred face that he refuses to be seen in daylight until he forms a relationship with a woman who has a few issues of her own(the role played by the magnificent Barbara Barrie). In the episode ""Daughter Am I In My Father's House,"" comedic actor Barbara Harris (""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" ""A Thousand Clowns"") gives a remarkably poignant performance as a timid teenage girl overwhelmed and exploited by her fanatical, power-obsessed father. Special kudos also go to actor John Larch (""Dirty Harry"") starring in the episode ""Today the Man Who Kills the Ants Is Coming"" as a police officer in the throes of burnout that make him a danger to himself as well as others.

This Set 2 of ""Naked City"" offers a fun feature on the drop-down menu: Complete run-throughs of the commericals that aired during episode broadcasts. Remember the Pepsi Generation? Raleigh Cigarettes? How about double your pleasure with Doublemint Gum? And we can't forget Dial Soap that leaves no icky film on the skin!

My only complaint - no fault of the DVDs - is that ""Naked City's"" addictive jazz score disappeared as the series progress further into 1962 and was replaced with another theme score that has no where near the exciting punch of Nelson Riddle's original. Still, regardless of this deep disappointment, the excellent performances and production helped me to get over this glitch - somewhat.

If you like TV film noir as much as I do, then do yourself a favor: Purchase this terrific Set 2 of ""Naked City"". Better yet, purchase the whole series! You'll have yourself a real treasure.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-City-Set-2/dp/B000BD1LKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked City - Set 2</a>",1335052800,,3709,5.045676998368679
2414024,3,B000BD1LKY,"I had not seen Naked City (1958-63) before, and was expecting a gritty cops and robbers type drama, but that is not what this series is about.  The program is hard to classify, as sometimes the focus is on the episode's guest star(s), with the regular cast of police detectives barely involved.  Each episode starts with a fresh canvas, but it is nearly impossible to predict what kind of picture will be painted.

Box Set 2 contains 12 episodes from the fourth and final season of the series (1962-63).  Set in New York City, these stories vary widely in subject matter, quality and style.  Seldom straightforward criminal investigations, instead these tales often meander down some obscure paths.  The result is a very mixed bag.  The episodes run from very compelling and thought provoking, to the offbeat, to a few that are over the top, to some that are tedious and not very interesting.

Because the regular cast is not always prominently featured, it takes a while to develop some sense of the relationship between Detectives Adam Flint (Paul Burke), and Frank Arcaro (Harry Bellaver), and Lt. Mike Parker (Horace McMahon).  Unfortunately Flint's fianc Libby Kingston (Nancy Malone), has very little screentime.  Which stories may be of interest is probably a very individual matter.  These are the episodes that I found noteworthy.

The Multiplicity of Herbert Konish:  David Wayne is a classy and talented actor, and this intriguing story about exploring freedom, where he plays a character leading three different lives, is a nice showcase for his talents.

Idylls of a Running Back:  Features Oscar winner Sandy Dennis (Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf) in an interesting role, as a delusional and homicidal woman.  Aldo Ray is a football player, who becomes the victim of a fantasy.  The story is rather unusual for this collection, as it features a rare premeditated act of violence.

And By The Sweat of thy Brow:  A very sensitive story, with a strong performance by the underrated actress Barbara Barrie (Suddenly Susan), and a close to the edge performance by Richard Jordan (Logan's Run, The Yakuza), as a man who hides his deformity in the darkness of the night.

Daughter Am I in My Father's House:  A story with a real edge to it, as a father (Dan Duryea) uses his daughter (Barbara Harris), as bait to vent his inner rage.  This kind of twisted behavior was not yet an overused clich, and although the story may not be that believable, and the ending is tepid, it is still interesting to see how the concept of vigilantism was handled.

The Rydecker Case:  Detective Flint stops a car that is moving erratically, drugs are found on the scene, and the young woman (Kathryn Hayes, As The World Turns) driving is arrested.  When the case comes to trial, Flint's motives come into question, as his past behavior in a similar case is revealed in court.  This episode is notable as a rare occasion where Flint is the main focus.

Lawrence Dobkin the narrator for the series, closes each episode with the line, `There are eight million stories in the Naked City, this is has been one of them'.  Naked City is definitely about telling stories, most which are unconventional for a standard police drama.  Superwriter Sterling Silliphant, was the executive story consultant for the series, and some of the episodes have similarities to the kind of exploratory adventures Silliphant was also producing on Route 66.  Nelson Riddle provides the music for the series.

Naked City has a bold approach, but it is not always successful, and the focus wanders far and wide.  With crime and the police often on the periphery, the regular cast is pushed far into the background, making it hard to consistently identify with them.  Paul Burke is a fine actor, but his talents are underused here.  While some of the episodes are interesting, the overall quality of the series is too uneven to justify a general recommendation of this collection.  If you are curious, you may just have to see for yourself.  Something which is an now a very expensive proposition, as the price of the set has gone sky high, since going out of production.

The image quality of the episodes is excellent, but subtitles are not available.  Original commercials from the era are also included as extras, but unfortunately there are no features specific to the series.  With the passing of Paul Burke in September of 2009, Nancy Malone is at this time, the only surviving cast member.",1266451200,6,4459,4.855629139072848
2414025,5,B000BD1LKY,"The fact that the entire series is not available on DVD is a crime of the first order. In viewing these episodes on DVD (for the first time, since childhood in the early '60's) I found them to be in pristine condition.  The care and intelligence in which these episodes were written, photographed and acted makes me mourn for the state of series TV today. Unlike most TV of the day, this series was filmed on location in the streets of New York; authenticity rings through in every aspect of it's production.  I plead with Image Entertainment or Columbia pictures to put out the entire series on DVD. Watching these episodes again makes me remember what we've lost in terms of quality viewing.",1248134400,,693,4.626016260162602
2414026,5,B000BD1LKY,Hard to believe that this series truly has stood the test of time. memories of me forty nine years ago watching these episodes our revelations of my child hood. To interpid these shows at fifty nine rather than nine amazes me. The episodes are even better now that i have become older. The shows were so well acted and produced it is truly amazing. And being a native New Yorker from Manhattan i have acutly stood in front of some of the brownstones they filmed in front of! I could not say enough great things about this wonderfull series! thanx for providing the chance to get them and go back in time to great tv shot in a then great city!,1221696000,,642,4.31404958677686
2414027,4,B000BD1LKY,"I remembered watching ""Naked City"" reruns late at night on a local NYC station when I was younger so when I saw that some episodes were released on dvd in a ""best of"" format, I thought I'd buy a set and refresh my memory. I've been hooked ever since. This is a great show, and a great showcase of '60s New York. A scene in one episode, not necessarily on this set, was filmed in the original Penn Station. I was born after it was razed and, while I've seen photos of it in books, nothing compares to actual footage. It's a shame that Sony/Columbia has not released full season sets of this show, and that Image Entertainment only released ""best of"" sets. Hopefully someday all 4 seasons of this show will see the light of day on dvd.",1213920000,,733,4.280575539568345
2414028,5,B000BD1LKY,"This television show is one of the great TV shows.  This set is even better than set 1 even though set 1 is great too.  The episodes are full of very realistic people and incidents and a humanity to all the characters.  There are no absolute bad guys or good guys.  The good guys can be hot tempered and moody and the bad guys are sometimes very difficult to see through their goodness.  The stories are 3 dimensional and and exciting.  The direction and scripts are wonderful.  The show won several Emmys for its editing.  The love of actors and acting is something that stands out in the show.  There is actually one episode where a young man who is a homicidal tries to get away with it by scaring people to death with fake props such as a knife and a gun.  Nancy Marchand, Aldo Ray, Sandy Dennis etc. star in episode and create memorable characters.  This show must have been an actor's dream and because it was the first TV show actually filmed on NYC streets the show could probably draw in the greatest actors and actresses from the stage.  It has a very different feel to it than Hollywood cops shows and a grittier and more complex image.  It's sad that this show has been lost in the memory of so many people.",1211068800,,1219,4.34070796460177

2414030,5,B000BD1LKY,"The 138 episodes (all in B&W) of the police drama ""Naked City"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1958-1963.  The series started in a 30-minute format (39 episodes), took a year long break and return in a 60-minute format.  The series was filmed in the old Biograph Studios in the Bronx, famous as the studio where D.W. Griffith got his start.

Image Entertainment's 3 DVD release ""Naked City - Set 2"" contains an assortment of  twelve of the hour-long episodes from seasons 3 and 4.  The titles, episode numbers, and original air-dates are detailed below.

Although the title makes it sound like a racy exploitation series it is actually the total opposite.  Many consider this gritty crime drama the best ever of its genre and the title reflects a focus on stripping away the glamour off NYC and exposing its ugly inside; at least to the extent that they could get away with on broadcast television during those years.

""Naked City"" is a follow-up to the 1948 film noir feature of the same name.  Both movie and television series utilized extensive location shooting and they definitely have a different feel than the Hollywood product of that era.  Also unusual was featuring jazz music by Billy May and Nelson Riddle.

The show never stopped changing its cast and was a bit like ""Police Story"" in this regard,  as it was designed to showcase its many great guest stars (it drew a lot of big names from Broadway); this variety was the show's greatest asset.

FIVE STARS!",1203033600,,843,4.24223602484472
2414032,3,B000BD1LKY,"I love collecting and studying TV's Golden Age, but I find this series very frustrating. I prefer a basically straightforward story---something that really pulls you in and, despite its twists and turns and oddities in style, still lets you follow it through from beginning to end.  And when the end comes, I prefer a feeling of finality, of inevitability, a resolution that seems fitting and conclusive.  Just old fashioned, I guess.

Naked City's story-telling is frequently too abstruse for my taste, but there's a good reason why.  The series is, after all, a chronicle of the time and place in which it was made. For me, it stands as a documentation of:

1.) New York, the city itself in all of its grit and glory.  It's fun to watch these shows, reproduced in crystal-clear transfers, and just feast your eyes on the REAL streets of New York, c. 1960-63.  Practically worth the price of these discs alone.

2.) The ""Greenwich Village"" style of theatre of the early 60's, with its avant garde overtones and sometimes ""freaky"" characters, situations, and visual storytelling (and episode titles!) Anchoring the stories are 3 standard-type cops, featuring straight-as-an-arrow acting (very convincing) by Paul Burke combined with the far more stagey, almost caricature style of Horace MacMahon and Harry Bellaver, thrust into some of the wackiest situations ever to come from the Off-Broadway experimental theatre scene.  What usually results is a mish-mash of style and content, which rarely comes together convincingly in the end (the sadistic, unhinged acrobatic dwarf-landlord who attacks Martin Sheen and Peter Fonda with a bull-whip for no apparent reason in an earlier release [""The Night the Saints Lost Their Halos""]is a REAL tip-off that we're in for some rough going in the series...)

In Set 2, watch our for

""Memory of a Red Trolley Car"", with its incredibly chintzey opening flashback scene, lots of ""far-out"" visualtouches and deliberately ""outre"" psychological jibber-jabber, complete with a scenery-chewing performance by Barry Morse (a fine actor who needed strong direction to curb his bad habits).

""And By the Sweat of Thy Brow""  has a very promising premise and some fabulous direction and camera work--for the opening 10 minutes or so. But the allure and mystery of the central relationship is blown once we see Jonah's disfigured face---the story then settles down into a fairly routine concerned-cop-tries-to-help-troubled-teen yarn.  A great opportunity lost (along with some more obscure pseudo-psychology between Barbare Barrie and Paul Burke).

""Dust Devil on a Quiet Street"" features another over-the-top scenery-chomping performance, this time by Richard Basehart. Similarly, ""And If Any Are Frozen""...is done in by Nehemiah Persoff's broad caricature of a nutty Rumanian.

On the other hand, John Larch is gut-wrenchingly intense in ""Today the Man Who Kills the Ants.."" David Wayne is remarkably restrained and deft

in the charming and touching ""Multiplicity of Herbert Konish"", and ""The Rydecker Case"" gives us a powerful and sobering look at the corrupt politics which undermine the efforts of honest agents of the law. And Dan Duryea and Barbara Harris are terrific in ""Daughter I Am.."", which only occasionally veers into the too-theatrical realm.

3.) Perhaps most importantly, the series often served as a showcase for iconic stage performers who left very little of their work on film.

a.) The young Barbara Harris (""Daughter I am...') was a very cultish actress on Broadway, for whom the musicals ""On a Clear Day.."" and ""The Apple Tree"" were written.

b.) George Rose (""Go Fight City Hall"") was a MAJOR character actor, starring as Captain Hook opposite Sandy Duncan's Peter Pan and The Modern Major-General in the Kevin Kline/Linda Ronstadt ""Pirates of Penzance"", to name but a few (impressive Shakesperean credits as well).

c.) Joseph Buloff, who joins George Rose in the nutty and totally off-beat Act 4 of ""Go Fight City Hall"", was, among other things, the original Ali Hakim in ""Oklahoma"".  Check out the moment when Rose and Buloff, drunk out of their minds on the New York Harbor ferry, actually

LOOK INTO THE CAMERA and WAVE TO US (!!!!), totally breaking the dramatic illusion. What a showcase for these two grand, old-style comedians!

d.) Let's not forget Harry Bellaver himself, an old Broadway character player--he created many roles, including Sitting Bull in the original ""Annie Get Your Gun"".

So ""Naked City"", whatever its artsy-ness and pretensions, still represents an amazing visual chronicle of an exciting, important period of American theatricality. It's great to have it preserved.",1177027200,9,4653,5.255405405405406

 These shows,taken from the 1962 season,feature Jean Stapleton(Edith Bunker),Nancy Marchand(later Lidia Soprano),Richard Basehart, Sandy Dennis, Aldo Ray,among the strs featured in this set of stories.

2414034,5,B000BD1LKY,"As previous reviewers have noted, this is a remarkable drama series from an earlier, more idealistic time. It's a pity we don't have a bit more of such earnestness & idealism today, because I'm not sure that the edgy, dark ""realism"" of some contemporary entertainment will age as well as this show has, for all that it's clearly rooted in its time. But what a time! TV was still open to literate, questioning, even experimental drama; and even with the network restrictions then, it pushed for truly adult entertainment. Indeed, it's quite possible that those network restrictions made the writers more creative & inventive.

Each episode is almost a small movie, with a distinctive look & vivid characters. Strict realism is often eschewed for intense characterization, sometimes a little larger than life, in order to illuminate one facet of the human soul. We get symbolic drama, absurdist farce, whimsy, elegy, regret ... all depending on the story being told.

Just to pick a few of the episodes:

""Today the Man Who Kills the Ants is Coming"" shows us a decent, hardworking man, driven by gnawing demons both within & without, crumbling before our eyes. It's an early depiction of the toll exacted by life, when even doing your best isn't enough. John Larch gives a performance that's almost too painful to watch in its naked honesty.

""The Multiplicity of Herbert Konish"" is more in the whimsical vein, although with a serious point. Here we have a man living several lives at once, because he sees no reason why he shouldn't try & experience life on as many levels as possible. A paean to non-conformity, Herbert Konish puzzles & bemuses the police attempting to track him down, because he isn't actually committing any crimes. He isn't in it for the money or any scams, he simply wants to sample as many possibilities as he can.

""Idylls of a Running Back"" is probably one of the earliest depictions of the deluded celebrity stalker, with Sandy Dennis chilling as a young woman living in her own fantasy world. It's telling that even when the truth is revealed, the life of the innocent football star she claimed as her lover is still tainted, and it's clear that things will never be the same for him again. Aldo Ray is excellent as the man who's physically capable of overcoming any obstacle, but helpless in the face of this very different threat.

""Daughter Am I in My Father's House"" is a truly fascinating, sexually twisted tale of an overprotective father, whose attempts to maintain his daughter's honor are gradually revealed as his own warped drive for control, for sexual release through violence, and an almost incestuous compulsion.

""And by the Sweat of Thy Brow"" is practically a fairytale with a twist. Richard Jordan portrays a scarred young man who lives by night, almost in another world. Barbara Barrie is the somewhat too prim & self-denying young woman whose life he saves. It's rather like Beauty & the Beast, except that the story goes even deeper, revealing Barbara Barrie's own inner scars, even as Richard Jordan is eased into the daylight by a sympathetic but firm Detective Flint.

And let me comment here on the overall fine performances of the cast regulars, who serve as our guides into this complex & compelling New York. Even when they seem to take a back seat to the week's guest stars, they all have revealing lines & quirks which flesh them out fully over the course of the series' run. And the commercials are an extra treat, a real time capsule!

All in all, an exemplar of superior television, most highly recommended!",1147824000,37,3566,4.813725490196078

8085290,5,B000BD1LKY,"What a GREAT TV series. I bought year (2) to determine the viewing quality.  Thus far the Video quality is very good to excellent even though I doubt that this is re-mastered material. It's nice to be able to watch a TV series with realism and good story lines... minus the PC bull that infects today's programs. If you like film NOIR...this is as close as TV ever got to it and Yes, it is in Black/White...no color.",1453075200,,416,4.333333333333333

8085293,5,B000BD1LKY,"Naked City is a perfect name for a perfect show.  It is written in a style that many others tried to mimic...even to this day.  This show is an elegant portrayal of traditional life for some ordinary people in the city of New York.  Instead of focusing on the operations of the police and how the police are crime solving, this show offers the viewers close up and personal insights into the lives of the citizens, the characters, and those people who are struggling with one devil or the other.  Exceptional writing complimented by extraordinary acting.  I will watch these videos for years.  Priceless.",1422316800,2,604,4.759615384615385
