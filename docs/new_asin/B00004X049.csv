1366568,2,B00004X049,"It's difficult to review this DVD negatively because Morgan Ki'ilehua is obviously sincere and truly trying to be helpful. I do suppose her program could help someone who has absolutely NO familiarity with the tarot whatsoever; but it's so painfully dull I have to wonder how many absolute beginners would find the patience to sit through the whole thing. I found her teaching not merely elementary but impossibly dumbed-down, and what's more, despite the title, really rather formulaic. She does appear to extemporize here & there and it's a marked improvement over her robotic recitation of prepared text (which unfortunately makes up the bulk of the material). I can't recommend it to anyone but the staunchest audio-visual learner.",1183852800,4,735,5.237288135593221
1366569,5,B00004X049,"I suppose some people found this DVD unhelpful. But, to those of you who are picking up the Tarot for the first time these two DVD's are extremely beneficial. She does not talk to fast. If she talked any faster I would have had to rewind. The key point that is so helpful, is that why she is talking she has a card up in the upper left hand corner of her screen - and as she talks she highlights certain parts of the card and explains to you the meaning of why the image is there. She lays out spreads and shows you how to do a mechanical reading and then using the same cards shows you how it would look intuitively - which I found very helpful. I believe her method of teaching was refreshing and will help others too, in further understanding their own spreads. I suppose it's mainly meant for beginners, though I don't feel I'm a beginner and I felt I received wonderful information that was very enlightening. It also gave me insights into certain cards that I had not thought of myself. Out of all the Tarot books I've read to-date I would highly recommend: Joan Bunning's - Learning the Tarot - as she not only gives lessons and exercises in her book to practice, along with a page devoted to each card - her book (in full) is online as well, so you can print out the exercises which is very beneficial. Also, if you check with Barnes and Nobles they offer a FREE online course that uses this same book and further helps you in your studies, with support and students too boot, all for free. However, with all of these tools, the Tarot is still a very difficult study for so many, which is the reason so many give up. These two DVD's offer insights that the free B&N course and books don't give you. And to boot they give you a feeling of sitting with a professional reader that you won't get from any book. I believe these two DVD's complimented the Joan Bunning approach and taught me new ways of viewing the Tarot. I highly recommend both DVD's. Most Tarot courses tell you not to stop your studies with their book, so to me I found these three courses most helpful as the free online course (which I think comes out each spring), but you have to check B&N for the dates, gives you support from other beginning students the book is online and follows the course and these two DVD's give you new and exciting insights - personally after all my studies these are the three things I would recommend for beginners as they all compliment each other, and all offer something different. Good luck and may the Spirit of the Tarot guide you to the books and programs that will best help you become the best Tarot Reader you can be...",1171670400,23,2634,4.334008097165992

1366572,5,B00004X049,"This Dvd clearly illustrates the intuitive and mechanical approach to the tarot.

She educates you and guides you on focusing on the divinity of the spirit,applying the psychic sense that connects to the archetypes that make up the tarot. She facinates us with several types of readings,showing that the reader can do the cards using their instinct.",1146614400,11,349,5.12280701754386
1366573,5,B00004X049,"Both Tarot DVD program are great! They are just what I wanted and they both had exactly the content in them that was stated on Amazon's product page. I did not want to read or buy a book on the Tarot, so programs fit the bill. Both DVDs had graphics just like a book and explained the symbolism of the cards (1st DVD) or how to read the Tarot intuitively (2nd DVD) and both had sample spreads.

Really, the woman who teaches on camera speaks fine, if she spoke any faster, it would be like a used car salesman.

I have found that most how to DVDs are like books and that's the way they should be. They are for people that do not want to read or have the time to read, but want the information explained to them or maybe they are even dyslexic.

I can say if you are an advance card reader both DVD's content probably not for you.

1366574,5,B00004X049,"Morgan 's video is by far the best  on the market.  She demystifies the tarot by clearly and effectively consolidating all the information  on tarot in a sensible format that is easy to apply.  Her intuitive approach is genuine and fosters a non-mechanical approach to understanding and reading the tarot. Morgan is an effective communicator who is truly able to express and organize the esoteric knowledge in a clear , concise and creatiive manner.

Morgan guides you through each step, covering everything from how to care for your cards, to card positions and a variety of spreads. It's like having a private teacher right by your side!

1366591,5,B00004X049,What a wonderful woman and awesome CD. I love the fact that she uses her own intuition to read.

1366593,4,B00004X049,"this dvd is great for a beginner. i did learn new spreads and i liked that aspect. i guess i was just hoping for more about how to open up more to my intuition and i guess i am looking for information that cant really be taught. she went through all the cards and gave interpretations of each but it still seemed pretty mechanical. i guess i just wanted something more about how to determine what each card means depending on your particular reading. each card can mean different things and i find it hard to know which interpretation to go with during a reading.  i wanted to know more about how to put the situation or story together to give a good reading.  like i said, maybe im looking for something that is too profound to be taught to me, that i must find from within myself with practice.
if you're a beginner and want good mechanical interpretations of each card and want to learn spreads, this is a great dvd.",1257033600,,919,4.337209302325581
1366594,5,B00004X049,"The main thing that this DVD is trying to teach you is the difference between mechanical reading of tarot cards and an intuitive reading.  If you are an experienced tarot card reader, you would have already developed intuitive feel for the cards through practice; if you are new to reading tarot cards, the ultimate way for developing the intuitive feel for tarot cards is through practice.

What you may get from this DVD are some pointers related to the care for the cards, how you may read 4 different spreads, and you may get the idea of several different ways in which each card of tarot deck may be interpreted. The possibilities for card interpretation would depend on what is it that you are reading for, what are the other cards involved, where are they positioned, as well as on your intuitive feeling for the cards and the situation.

At the end of the video is an overview of 14 different card spreads for example, how to get yes and now answer, how to do a relationship spread, Celtic cross spread, how to attain your desires in life, how to do weekly spread, how to do monthly spread, how to do reading for your love life, how to do reading related to your children, even how to do reading for your pet, and few other spreads.",1255478400,8,1240,4.477876106194691
1366595,4,B00004X049,I am a beginner.  This video was very helpful.  It not only gave me the meaning of each card but emphasized how the meaning can be affected by the cards next to it and/or if it is reversed.,1235260800,2,189,3.9473684210526314
1366596,3,B00004X049,"I have always been interested in Tarot but understand that it is not quite my vocation holistically.  Nonetheless it is definitely entertaining to me to learn more about it whenever the opportunity presents itself.

I felt this video was informative but I had a hard time with the format. I felt the narrator could have been more descriptive in the layouts and probably should have explained the cards first before doing mock intuitive readings right off the bat.

I am an intuitive Healer by trade and felt that the way she presented the ""How Tos"" of developing your intuition were limited at best.  She probably is the real deal, however she came off a bit on the con artist side to me during those mock readings. Some of things that she spoke about contradicted her own words at times.  I'm sure many newbies might be turned off by the presentation of this video.

Having said that, I still give it 3 stars based on the content alone.  I am a big fan of watching a video over reading to learn new information, so I did like how she went through each card in the entire deck and explained it.
