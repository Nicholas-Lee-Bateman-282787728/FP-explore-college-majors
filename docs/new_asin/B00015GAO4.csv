1971448,5,B00015GAO4,"This set of TaeBo tapes is intended for people who are already familiar with TaeBo!  If you are new to TaeBo I definitely recommend you start with one of the other sets that includes a workout entitled ""Instructional"" or ""Foundation,""  the type of video on which Billy instructs you how to perform each punch, kick, combination, etc.  He does an outstanding job teaching you how to perform the exercises...provided you choose the proper video.  This is not it!

That said, this set is intended for people who already KNOW how to do TaeBo, who have been doing it for a while, who are already in pretty good shape, and want to get into even better shape.  If that's what you're looking for this is outstanding!  The Flex tape focuses more on toning (I'm sure my fellow TaeBo heros know what I mean - he tells you to ""hold it"" a LOT!  Haha!) and the cardio...well, that's obvious.  You just double time everything until you can't double time anymore.  And again, if you do not know what I mean by phrases like ""TaeBo heros"" and ""double time"" this tape is not for you!  This is a set that has to be worked up to.  Oh, but once you get there it is really worth it.

I have been doing TaeBo for four years and for me, it is absolutely the best thing I have ever done as far as my physical fitness is concerned.  It has really slimmed down my waist, toned my arms and legs, as well as improved my balance and posture.  Energy, endurance...everything!  It also helped me lose 60 pounds!  It's an awesome workout.  I just can't praise it enough.",1111190400,92,1536,4.386524822695035
1971449,5,B00015GAO4,"This is a great place to start a TaeBo workout. There are two Regular DVDs and one Express DVD.
Cardio: Used to get your heart moving it's a good and fast workout.
Flex: Emphasizes holding a certain position to maximize a particular muscle group.
Flex Express: A short workout if you don't have alot of time. It's short, so don't expect a fat-burner or a heart mover. It's good for that one day that you can't do a whole DVD workout.
All-in-all an excellent value. If you know how to do the moves properly(he does give some explanation in the set)get this set next! If not, you might want to get the basic and then these. But if you know how to do a few kicks and punches properly, get it!",1081123200,47,689,4.267175572519084

1971457,3,B00015GAO4,"After using each of the DVDs, I totally understand some of the previous comments about the 'inaccurateness' of Billy talking throughout the workout and the inconsistent 'sets' of repetitions.  It is a bit annoying and frustrating compared to the 'original VHS Tape' of the original Taebo workout.  I really wish they would have reproduced the original one on DVD - that was a great workout.
As far as a workout though, the DVDs do give a good workout.
I would try a different DVD next time, I'm not sure that I like the new 'flex' that he builds into the workout.  Personally, the set is 'ok' but I don't think I would recommend this set to a friend.",1434067200,4,650,4.491525423728813

1971462,5,B00015GAO4,I loved the original Taebo Vhs's and this DVD did NOT disappoint!  The cardio dvd is similar to the basic vhs! Im glad I ordered it bc i was skeptical from the reviews!  I wanted one that was like his basic vhs. Happy girl here!,1428364800,16,228,4.044444444444444
1971463,5,B00015GAO4,"I am almost 70yrs old and this is by far the best work out I do.  I have his VHS tapes and made good use of them but the DVD is the new version and I am into the second DVD. I would recommend this work out for all ages, not only is it a work out you can also learn some self defence form them. The time goes fast and you feel great when its done.",1427932800,6,346,3.4935064935064934
1971464,4,B00015GAO4,This set is real good.  Tae Bo gets me jazzed to exercise!  There is nothing I can't do on this DVD.  There are some exercise videos that are too hard on my knees.  This set doesn't bother my knees at all.,1427760000,2,205,3.926829268292683

1971466,3,B00015GAO4,Would be good if you're a beginner. I'm just getting back into working out after my third baby but I've been doing taebo on and off for 10+ years. I still found myself often double timing most exercises to make it truly cardio for me. I prefer the old taebo advanced videos (which are free on YouTube) or taebo boot camp if you're going to purchase something- those are much better.,1425340800,,382,4.394366197183099

1971475,5,B00015GAO4,Mr. Blanks has assisted me for the last nine years with keeping the 60lbs that I had completely off. His exercise DVD's always make me sweat and keep me revved up.

1971479,4,B00015GAO4,I did Tae Bo years ago and was in the best shape of my life. So I decided to order this to get me started again. It is definitely not for advanced people looking for a challenge but it gives you a good solid workout.

1971482,5,B00015GAO4,"I love Billy Blanks and was thrilled to buy this product! I love these workouts, they are hard, but you can adjust as you need, building up your endurance!

1971483,2,B00015GAO4,I did not buy my dvds from amazon. I purchased them separately. One from Walmart and another from a garage sale. I have been doing tae bo since it first came out. These dvds are a disappointment. They are not in the least bit challangeing. I barely broke a sweat. I now only do these dvds when Ihave had a bad night and don't have the energy for a more intense workout come morning. Something is better than nothing.,1307491200,2,416,4.2784810126582276
1971484,3,B00015GAO4,"All i ever really do it cardio taebo dvds because i feel the best with doing cardio. So, i just got this because cardio was written on the actual dvd!
well, haha is what i say to that! This is cardio taking 2 steps down. It's not faced pace at all unless you're a beginner! I sped it up for myself to get a complete workout.

Be prepared for a 6 min warm up and 6 min cool down. So long!",1300233600,2,387,3.7777777777777777
1971485,4,B00015GAO4,"I have been using Billy Blanks' workout videos for about 3 years for several reasons 1) the ability to build muscle and burn fat in a short amount of time 2) everyone seems to be having fun even with the hardest workout 3) I can actually tell that the people in the video are struggling through the workout (amount of sweat, grunts, facial expressions, etc.) That is especially important to me because I can relate to them and see that even though the people in the video appear to be fit, that this workout is hard for them as well.

These workouts are pretty solid. It's not the most difficult workout from Billy Blanks (Bootcamp is brutal). I was able to work up a sweat fairly quickly and keep it going throughout the workout. This not for beginners, more for someone who has fitness experience or prior experience with Tae-Bo. If you purchase this and watch the videos before you perform the workout you might think that ""this is easy and a waste of money"" but I feel that these flex workouts are really a ""mind over matter thing"". You are being asked to concentrate on a muscle group for a period of time (also known as static  or isometric exercise I believe) and that takes a lot of concentration. I found myself mentally coaching myself to isolate my quad or my triceps  because if I wasn't actively thinking of that muscle, I wasn't getting the workout I needed to be.

**A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: With these ""flex"" workouts (which use isometric exercise) you must breathe while you are flexing. The reason he is shotting for you to count while you are holding is because when you isolate a muscle like you are being asked, not breathing will elevate your blood pressure in a short amount of time, which is dangerous. So make sure you use counting as a way to breathe through the exercises.

Hope this helps.",1279756800,23,1815,4.521341463414634
1971486,5,B00015GAO4,"I have always loved Billy Banks' Taebo routines, but this 3 disk set is great.  It's fun, energetic, and it keeps me moving.  This series is so much better than his ""Transformation"" disks.  I am enjoying the workouts!",1272672000,,217,4.657894736842105
1971487,3,B00015GAO4,"I had been looking for a good cardio dvd to get me pumped up at home.  I am ""mid-level"" in terms of fitness, not a beginner, but definitely not an athlete by a long shot! I do 30-45 minutes of cardio on a regular basis (i.e. a treadclimber workout, step aerobics class, kick-boxing class, ect.)

I chose Billy Blank because he always has great routines that are really challenging. Usually, I can't make it through and entire tae-bo work-out without stopping once or twice, so I was expecting an intense program. When I popped in the cardio dvd, I was sooo disappointed! The work out is so incredibly easy! I barely broke a sweat, which says a lot because I'm not in the best shape.

I would recommend this dvd to someone who is at a beginners fitness level, but for anyone above that, its not worth it. I was so dissapointed with how easy the routine was that I haven't even put in the other dvds yet because I don't want to waste my time. Maybe the ""flex"" routine is better, I may never know because I was so upset! Billy Blank usually brings in the heat with his routines, but this time he barely sparked a flame!",1231632000,17,1116,4.330143540669856
1971488,5,B00015GAO4,"I disagree with some of the reviews about learning taebo.  I love taebo & have been doing it for a few years now.  I think it's ALOT easier to learn than aerobics.  I could never get all the aerobic moves.  Too confusing.  To me, taebo is very easy to learn. I bought this video when it came out in the stores & love it.  I especially love the 25 min flex workout because I have a newborn & not much time on my hands.  Before I would do this workout if I didn't have alot of time & wanted to get in some exercise.  Now it's perfect for when my daughter is taking a nap & I just want to exercise VERY fast.  Hopefully I will be able to get back to the other two 40min dvds that come with this set.  They are also excellent.  I find much more relaxed, rejuvenated, and my posture is soooo much better after doing these workouts.  I've always had posture difficulties, especially after having a baby.  Taebo is great & alot of fun...and Billy Blanks is inspirational.",1185408000,4,964,4.173913043478261
