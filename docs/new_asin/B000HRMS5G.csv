8273962,1,B000HRMS5G,"Why only sold by ""used"" markets? Maybe because it's not an official release!!!

Where is the song ""Money?"". It's on the LD and CD.

When this DVD has an authorized release there will be much fanfare about it. Why buy over-priced unofficial releases and the band see none of the profits.

Wait for the official release which should be soon now that PULSE is out of the way.

Shame, shame, shame for trying to sell these unofficial releases. Wait for David Gilmour's stamp of approval.",1169337600,7,483,4.647058823529412
