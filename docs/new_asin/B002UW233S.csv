8381572,4,B002UW233S,"This is a great DVD set for someone new to exercise. It's not challenging enough for someone who has been working out for a long time, but it's perfect for beginners. Harley is a great instructor who teaches form perfectly.",1403222400,,223,4.6

8381575,5,B002UW233S,I love the fact that you can do these 5 day exercises with just a mat and hand weights.  I am already feeling more toned in my arms and legs.  I love it!,1356307200,,153,3.606060606060606
8381576,5,B002UW233S,"I really appreciate how time effective this workout is.  5 phases, 25 minutes, im done...and sore.  I don't have a home gym, so the fact that i don't need anything other than a pair of hand weights makes it perfect! GREAT WORKOUT DVD!!!",1351900800,4,236,4.465116279069767
8381577,4,B002UW233S,"I like that the workouts are only 25 minutes. The workouts get your heart pumping but the cardio could be more intense. Great to do on cold winter days!
I would recomend this to a friend. I like to mix my workouts up. This is a great one to do when you are short on time!",1323993600,4,271,3.857142857142857
8381578,5,B002UW233S,"Hi,
I ordered this product because I had heard about it in an article.  I was looking for something that didn't take a lot of time.
I did the first two workouts and they were very simplistic but that is a good thing.
I have been sore all day yesterday so that is also a good sign.
As for the diet.  I have been doing it for one week so far.  Food recipes are good.  It takes me about an 1hr to 1hr and a half to get my
food ready for the next day.  I'm trying to figure out a better way to get through the process.
I feel results.  Haven't weighed myself.  But I feel I can make it through the 5 weeks.
Glad I ordered it!",1309564800,5,621,3.7674418604651163
