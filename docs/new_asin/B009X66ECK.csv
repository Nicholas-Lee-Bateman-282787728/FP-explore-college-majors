5370762,2,B009X66ECK,"I was hoping this program could work for me at age 70.  I just couldn't keep up, even though Joel Harper's mother is shown doing the lower level conditioning. I noticed that she is unable to keep up sometimes, too.  The best programs I've found for older folks is Ann Pringle's Stronger Seniors workouts.  These are sold on Amazon.",1369267200,27,331,4.576271186440678

5370766,2,B009X66ECK,This was boring and difficult.  I didn't feel he was motivational at all.  The Absolute Beginners - Cardio and Strength Training for Seniors DVD  is way superior to this one.  A waste of money as it has already gone to the exercise DVD graveyard.,1408752000,2,246,4.5227272727272725

5370770,5,B009X66ECK,"I've bought w/o videos and always quit using them.  This was different. Any age would benefit. I'm 53 and could not keep up my first day, but the exercise moves were so easy, that i knew if i wasn't able to do them, I was not healthy or reasonably limber.  Not boring, and I didn't feel the need to keep up on my first day.  Simple techniques that I never thought of on my own. Explanations of the exercise while your doing the exercise is a mental plus. Three different age individuals are shown exercising at the same time to show reasonable expectations for your age. I'm looking forward to getting in shape.",1397779200,14,611,4.389380530973451
