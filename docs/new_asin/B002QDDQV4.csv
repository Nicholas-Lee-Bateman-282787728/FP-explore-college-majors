8377686,4,B002QDDQV4,"This is an entertaining film shot on location in Argentina. It tells the story of a gaucho (Rory Calhoun) who is unwilling to accept the changes that are occurring in his country. Those changes, in the name of ""progress"", include a railroad and a fenced-off Pampas. As a result, the way of the gaucho is soon to be extinct.

Jacques Tourneur stepped in for Henry King, who was unable to direct at the last minute. The lighting, shadows, and compositions are painterly and beautiful as one would expect in a Tourneur movie. Gene Tierney plays the love interest and is not terribly interesting, but she does an adequate job. Towards the end, I had no idea which way the story would go and whether the main characters would make it.",1485820800,,729,4.607692307692307

8377688,4,B002QDDQV4,"Originally Fox unimaginatively planned this project as a sequel to CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE, with Henry King again directing Tyrone Power and Jean Peters. Thankfully this was not to be. This uniquely southern, antipodean, Western was adapted by Philip Dunne from Herbert Childs' 1948 novel WAY OF A GAUCHO. Dunne's script is by turns didactic, preachy and calculatingly inoffensive to the Peron regime. Watch the film once for a sense of the plotline, then revisit the film with muted sound to enjoy the consistently painterly location-shoot visuals and the scrupulous artistry of Jacques Tourneur's masterful visual sense for composition and color.

Dunne's pricey screenplay aside, what actually hits the screen is one of Tourneur's most neglected and most beautiful outdoor films, larger and more spectacular than his fine Oregon Western CANYON PASSAGE and a companion to his townie Westerns with Joel McCrea. The saturated Technicolor photography is by Harry Jackson, and Tourneur has exotic Argentine locations--pampas and Andes--more authentic than those used by Hugo Fregonese in SAVAGE PAMPAS (filmed largely in Spain).

Calhoun's Martin/Valverde character alternates by necessity between cowboy, soldier and bandit roleplaying, and this makes the actor livelier and less taciturn than usual. The bandit persona is roguish and most engaging, with Calhoun in beard and gaucho drag resembling Ty Power at his most dashing. Gene Tierney in 1875 period costumes looks fabulous throughout, even pregnant and in pigtails, and has horseback sequences that will remind you of her melodramatic sunrise ride in LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN. The cast is rounded out by the familiar Hugh Marlowe, Everett Sloane and a surprisingly restrained Richard Boone, who like the Calhoun gaucho changes job descriptions and gains some humane sensitivity over the course of the film.

The film starts slowly, pontifically and militaristically, with Tierney appearing only 20 minutes into the story, but the imagery is consistently beautiful from the outset, and the film finally delivers a cumulative visual and emotional wallop in under 90 minutes that Henry King's Mexican epic didn't achieve in its overblown 150. Tourneur's films have never disappointed me, and this one looks better each time I replay it. With the Dunne verbiage filtered out or ignored, there's a spirited original score by Sol Kaplan to accompany the singular visuals.",1471564800,4,2414,5.466487935656836

8377690,3,B002QDDQV4,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere.",1360454400,2,949,5.051282051282051
8377691,4,B002QDDQV4,"If ever there has been great views, this film has them. Practically everything has been filmed in wonderful nature and old authentic buildings. The story is not as good. It is a bit hard to pinpoint what is the problem. Perhaps the story is a bit too melodramatic. Rory Calhoun is a great looking guy, but not a gaucho. He is a cowboy. Boone is always good and looks like an Argentinian. This is film worth watching, because it is so unique. This film must have been really great on a big canvas of a real movie theater.",1304985600,3,520,4.316326530612245
8377692,5,B002QDDQV4,The DVD arrived earlier than expected and in very good conditions. So much better than what I thought. The movie is great!,1303084800,3,122,4.590909090909091
8377693,3,B002QDDQV4,"Set in 1870's Argentina, a gaucho (an Argentinean cowboy) played by Rory Calhoun is sentenced to army service after killing a man in a fair fight. There, he clashes with the strong willed Major (Richard Boone) determined to break him. When he escapes to the mountains where he becomes a bandit hero to the Argentinean peasants, the single minded Major continues his relentless pursuit. Directed by Jacques Tourneur (CAT PEOPLE), the film benefits enormously from being filmed in the actual Argentina locations which gives the film a validity that sets it apart from a typical Hollywood western. Filmed in the Pampas and mountains, it looks genuine in a way that no soundstage or North American location could replicate. Unfortunately, some of the casting is problematic. Calhoun seems to be right out of Dodge City rather than Buenos Aires and that bland specimen of the American male, Hugh Marlowe (ALL ABOUT EVE) is a fish out of water. Fortunately, Boone seems believable and Gene Tierney has the grace and elegance of an Argentinean aristocrat. The film is notable for its era in its frank relationship between Calhoun and Tierney who are obviously loving and living without benefits of marriage and the film's ambiguous ending that leaves the fate of its major characters in doubt. With Everett Sloane.

The Fox DVD via Spain is in its proper full frame 1.33 aspect ratio (it's pre-wide screen) but it looks a bit smudgy at times but other than that a more than acceptable transfer.",1296086400,8,1487,4.948
