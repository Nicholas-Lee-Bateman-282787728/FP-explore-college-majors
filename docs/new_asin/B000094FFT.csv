7989074,4,B000094FFT,"A bit restrained for an Italian Horror film,,,,,, but this is really more mystery than Horror.... stylish but needed more of the red stuff.",1520380800,,139,4.833333333333333

7989077,2,B000094FFT,"The two stars are rather a rating of the DVD than the film itself. I bought this DVD because ""Italian audio"" and ""New and improved English subtitles"" are mentioned as DVD features on the backcover. But the DVD does not contain any subtitles at all and there's only the English audio. Apart from that, the DVD is OK, but I really prefer Italian audio with subtitles, so I feel rather annoyed about this.",1373414400,5,402,4.52054794520548
7989078,4,B000094FFT,"The really good news about this dvd is that it is in reality widescreen.
For some reason the box says it's the dreaded full screen or pan and scan format in which one third of the movie is chopped off to fit your old tube screen size.  This is widescreen though and so you get the whole picture as it was shot in 1991. The film itself is a pretty good thriller with a interesting twist at the end.  Unlike many giallos you actually see the killers face as he kills his victims and not just a pair of gloved hands. Still that doesn't mean you know the final twist.  The acting in this movie is very good and done with established and accomplished actors and Lamberto Bava delivers another solid
directing job.  The print looks great and is mastered very well.  This is a solid thriller/ mystery movie that fans of the genre will surely enjoy.",1228780800,7,841,4.3312101910828025
