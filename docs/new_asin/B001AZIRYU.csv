3476136,3,B001AZIRYU,"Say what you will about Uwe Boll, but the much maligned director knows how to garner one reaction or another from people.  Seed, a film that actually isn't based on a video game (although the PC game Advent Rising is included with the DVD here, no idea why) tells the story of mass murderer Max Seed (frequent Boll star Will Sanderson), who was electrocuted twice in the chair, and lived.  After being buried alive, Seed is out for bloody revenge against those who put him in the ground, most notably being the detective (Michael Pare) that busted him.  What sets Seed apart from the typical serial killer flick, and typical Boll flick, is that you really don't know what to expect to happen next.  When a movie starts out with a warning from PETA and shows actual footage of animal torture, you know you're in for something different.  Whether Seed is worth watching depends on how much you can stomach (the opening scenes are incredibly hard to watch), but Boll's film arguably says more about man's inhumanity to life than all the Saw's and Hostel's put together.  Definitely not for everyone, Seed is surprisingly daring, and the denouement will actually stay with you after the credits are done rolling.",1222214400,16,1208,4.755980861244019
3476137,1,B001AZIRYU,"I watched this last night around 4:00 a.m. in the morning. Some parts were really creepy and gory. I hated the beginning when they show dogs being tortured. The middle was pretty cool. The Seed character reminded me of Rob Zombie's Michael Myers. I didn't like the baby being tortured. I love horror movies, but I draw the line with animals and babies. Another thing I didn't like was the extremely depressing ending I would compare it to The Mist's ending. I couldn't believe it! If you love horror, don't watch SEED!!!",1221868800,7,520,4.663043478260869
3476138,1,B001AZIRYU,"Uwe Boll - Why is this guy allowed near a camera? How many bad films can one human make? If I didn't know better, I would suspect the OoooEee is trying to go for that record.

I rented this masterpiece yesterday, not knowing that it was another OooEee production. I knew I was in trouble when the PETA warning flashed on the screen at the beginning, followed by nightmare inducing scenes of animals being tortured. I kid you not...

This DVD is not a total tribute to nausea, there is short film on the disc called ""Criticism"", that is actually a decent horror film - too bad I didn't watch it first. And poor Michael Pare, reduced to starring in a bloody mess like this. My advice - just watch the short film and skip Seed altogether. You will thank me later.",1221868800,,760,4.345070422535211
3476139,5,B001AZIRYU,"we all know about uwe boll,or so we thought. what we see here is a first class horror movie with a 1-2 punch.the special fx were above average.gorehounds will not be disappointed, especially what ill just call the head banging scene. you will not be let down. and you won't believe your watching a boll movie. beware this film contains graphic scenes!!!! you have been warned.",1221264000,10,376,4.712121212121212
3476140,4,B001AZIRYU,I have always enjoyed horror movies. They are usually far fetched and kind of fun. SEED however is not fun. This has to be the most shocking and disturbing movie I have ever seen....It displays the most cruel and violent things that you could imagine.,1221177600,5,251,4.6
3476141,4,B001AZIRYU,"Uwe Boll's ""Seed"" is a bit different than his other works. ""Seed"" basically starts off with a brutal killer condemned to death. There is a law that states after three attempts to kill a prisoner with a certain amount of time and voltage, if the prisoner survives they have to be set free... Well, with a faulty electric chair and not enough funding to get a new one the warden and the rest of the gang bury ""Seed"" alive where he comes back on a viscious rampage.
""Seed"" doesn't have the HUGE production that's put into so many movies but the thing about Uwe Boll, is that he knows how to make it work and still look good.  ""Seed"" is brutal and violent with plenty of blood and gore to go around.  It's worth a watch.
  Finally, say what you will about Uwe Boll, he is getting better.  he knows how to direct a movie and Postal and Seed are good examples.  So don't dismiss it because you have heard he makes terrible movies, or you watched Alone in the Dark and said ""this guy sucks..."" it's just not true.. Watch it and ignore all the negativity around this guy.",1221091200,8,1063,4.29

3476154,4,B001AZIRYU,Loved this movie . I originally saw it on Netflix but they pulled it . Maybe it was too gory I don't know . Very very graphic violent scenes especially the animal cruelty scenes. Not for the squeamish . Liked it so much I ordered it . Plot is average but all together a entertaining movie for watching at home hugged up with your mate .,1419465600,,336,4.106060606060606
3476155,3,B001AZIRYU,"First of all, this contains some extremely disturbing real animal cruelty that apparently takes place on a fur farm. Boll is apparently against animal cruelty and just wanted people to be aware of this stuff. If you're like me and like animals, then you may just want to skip these parts. As for the film, it has its moments; however, for an unrated slasher from a known exploitation director, it was somewhat disappointing. After those disturbing sequences during the opening credits, we are off to a fast-paced start. We see a guy getting fried in the electric chair that's soon followed by a dream sequence of Seed picking up a baby on a bus and throwing it against a pole. We then are shown some videotaped sequences of Seed leaving a dog and people, one of which is again a baby, to die and decompose in his dungeon; I suppose he just leaves them there to starve to death. This may sound like it's going to be a really good and shocking slasher, but I just didn't think it was really involving because of some of the following: the prolonged sequence when the cops are killed in the dark house is poorly lit; the entire film contains no nudity, which is disappointing because nudity is usually expected for an unrated slasher; it contains no atmosphere or interesting scenery; none of the characters are interesting; I've seen films that Uwe Boll has made that are better directed than this; the soundtracks aren't as good as some of his other films; and I thought it needed a little more gore overall for an unrated slasher. The best gore scene is a prolonged sequence that seems to be shot in one take with a woman's head being hammered to a pulp. it looks like it was a mixture of CGI and practical effects. The film has pretty good amount of gore with that hammering scene being really gory, but I wouldn't say the overall film is an over-the-top bloodbath; I was expecting more gore from an unrated slasher from Uwe Boll. He has made films that I thought are a lot more fun, but I guess some may think it's one of his best films. Personally, I just found it to be kind of dull in between the violence.

The deleted scenes shows some more of that dungeon stuff with people and animals dying, and there's Seed exercising and some other stuff. There's also a behind the scenes extra and a short 18 minute short flick that has a little bit of torture and no nudity. I thought the quality on the DVD was disappointing for a fairly recently made movie. The contrast needs improvement, and the colors look somewhat faded. The brightness and sharpness are good, but I expected better color and contrast for a film that was made and released not too long ago. Some of the gore would've been easier to see if they improved the contrast and color.",1405641600,,2746,4.5030060120240485
3476156,5,B001AZIRYU,"One of the greatest movies ever made. And unfortunately, one of the most mentally disturbing movies ever made.
WATCHING THE FIRST SET OF THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED WITHOUT FULL KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT YOU WILL BE VIEWING. You have a choice to hit <next track> on your remote control to go to the next set. It is very disturbing and personally, I would rate it PG35. Because I think you have to at least be that age to be able to (somewhat) shake it off or rationalize things to be able to cope with what you saw. It sticks for a long time. Trust me. Google Seed and read up about it (even though they word it mildly)  but I will avoid that one and get back to the subject.  It's a great film, well written, well directed, excellent concept too. Just not scary enough for me. Good enough to watch sometimes though so I bought it. :)",1404518400,,827,4.227848101265823

A seething hatework for sure! The worst part of the movie is the soundtrack...although in the key scene, where Uwe vents it all, the music is used to great effect, I'll admit. And some real humanity between Michael Par&eacute; and Jodelle Ferland, who should win some kind of award. Not so bad Uwe, not so bad.

3476159,4,B001AZIRYU,"Great movie. The 'lady on the chair' scene is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. My only gripe was I did not like the main actor. He was like a cheesy detective out of a 70s sitcom. That aside, it was a good watch.",1393545600,,224,3.891304347826087

3476161,2,B001AZIRYU,"From what I understand Uwe Boll for some reason is one of the most despised directors on the planet. I have heard he makes nothing but very bad movies. Well the first film of his I saw was ""Rampage"". It was pretty disturbing, but it had decent acting, great production values, and so fourth. It wasn't bad at all, just nothing special. The next one I saw was ""Stoic"", which was actually a very good movie. It also was pretty disturbing, dark and ugly to watch, but it was well directed, very well acted, and I think it's a solid film. Then I saw ""Attack on Darfur"", which was a very noble attempt and showed that Boll indeed does have some humanity. Even though it's only in directl;y a true story, it is at times a very touching film. So now finally I have seen something Boll has done I didn't realy like very much. And that brings me to this film. People the opening as mentioned is very discusting. If seeing actual footage of a dog screaming in pain after it is being skinned alive interests you then fine, otherwise be warned. The opening sequence is very sick and several animals are brutally killed or tortured. It's just plain sick. After that the filmis pretty much a totally stupid slasher flick that is pretty twisted, but ultimately is just plain dumb. Much of it makes no sense, and it over all a pretty shabby film. It's not terrible at all, but it's not very good either.",1367625600,,1387,4.400778210116732

3476179,1,B001AZIRYU,"My name is Raul Valdez and im using my moms account. You can say all you want about me, and call me a hypocrite for loving movies like Apocalypse now, The Thing, Exorcist, Exorcist 3, which are movies that have violence, and even animal cruelty. I couldn't care less. This movie is pure garbage. I wouldnt give this to someone I disliked. Its not only overly gorey, but unrealistic. Oh yeah an unarmed man takes out a bunch of cops, waltches into prison, and servives his brains being boiled. So is this supernatural or based in reality? Sure Apocalyse Now had some animal cruelty but i don't remmeber it having sick crap every other second. This movie goes in the trash heap just like my copy went.",1357430400,2,699,4.511811023622047
3476180,1,B001AZIRYU,"Uwe Boll is as many people know is one of the worst directors of all time. He made House Of The Dead which after I watched, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone would give him money to make another movie. I enjoy disturbing movies I own a Serbian Film which is by far the most disturbing movie I have seen. Seed on the other hand is just trying to be shocking so without any real point so people will some how care that Uwe Boll still exists. He stated that if 1 million people sign a petition for him to stop making movies he will abide. I signed it but to my dismay only 350,000 people have signed it. I guess this has to do with the fact that nobody actually wasted their time on researching him or his awful movies.",1339545600,,731,4.048275862068966
3476181,5,B001AZIRYU,"This is one dark movie. I loved it. I don't want to spoil this cool movie. Just take more word for it, Seed is more like the Rob Zombie style Michael Myers. I am hoping their is a follow up DVD to see what Seed does next. I think they should have the little girl survive , grow up and go after Seed as a detective.",1327622400,,314,3.772727272727273
3476182,4,B001AZIRYU,"I hate writing reviews on sub-par movies, but in this case I had to! I gave it 4 stars because it had some real good cringe factor scenes, plus several other scenes that were much better than one would expect. However, Michael Pare pretty much sucked in this movie. I like him, he is a good actor if the writers and director let him ""do his thing"". They didn't in this flick. Pare could have brought this movie way up, if they would have let him be the same type character he was in ""Streets Of Fire"". But no, instead he is a whiner, and pussy through out. He is portrayed as a sensitive liberal ( I don't want to hurt anybody} police detective. This attitude manages to get everybody he loves or even likes killed . I just feel it all could have been better if Pare was more of a kick ass cop. The ending was different, not sure how I feel about it, except Pare pretty much got what he deserved. This movie is worth a watch, some good stuff in it, could have been alot better.",1324080000,,977,4.147368421052631
3476183,3,B001AZIRYU,"First off, I want to say that I'm not a fan nor hater of Uwe Boll. I've heard of some of his work, but never really watched any of it. In fact, when I stumbled upon this film on Netflix, I had to look his name up just to see who he was and some of his other work. Apparently there is a lot of people who dislike him and his films, and that's perfectly fine. But after seeing some of these low ratings and bad reviews about this film, I'm beginning to wonder if some of that natural dislike for Uwe Boll has clouded their judgment on this movie.  Don't get wrong, this isn't a horror masterpiece by any means. This film does have its problems. But being a bona fide horror fan, I've seen my fair share of flat out horrible films, and this one doesn't reach that level at all. And frankly, anyone that says otherwise obviously hasn't went too deep into the genre.
  The basic story is about a sadistic serial killer named Maxwell Seed, who finally gets apprehended by a detective Bishop. He's sentenced to the electric chair, except the only problem is after 2 jolts of current, he's still not dead. Rather than risk trying and third time and failing (since ""state law"" only allows three attempts and after that, the guy is supposed to be set free...wtf?) they just bury him alive. Of course, Seed digs out of his grave, kills all that wronged him, saving the detective and his family for last. Like I said, the film has its problems, and yes the script definitely has its weak moments. I really won't bother going into all the minor flaws, but when the main story involves a guy that won't die in the electric chair and digs his way out of his own grave, then you kinda have to take the film for what it is. Again, it sort of gets more far-fetched as it goes along. But again, I've seen far worse.
 Now another reason that people seem to be giving this movie a lot of bad reviews involves the first couple of minutes of the film alone. Yes, there is some real footage of animal cruelty shown. And no, its not the most pleasant thing to see, but I wasn't so repulsed or offended by it that I was going to denounce the whole film. Was there a real purpose to show it? Perhaps from the director's viewpoint, maybe. I personally think the film didn't really need it. The film would have just been as effective to me without it. And though I didn't enjoy it necessarily, I can take it for what its worth and still watch the film without completely dismissing it. What drives me nuts is people getting so offended and upset over films like this, yet they call themselves big horror fans. Its absolutely ridiculous. What do these people expect? Why are they watching it in the first place? If this sort of stuff bothers you or upsets you, then stay away! Plain and simple. Otherwise, stick to your PG-13 films that stay in your ""safe zone"". As for me, I want to see something that pushes boundaries.
 Besides some weaker plot points, the best thing about this film was its gore and violence, and that it didn't pull many punches. Not only did it contain the animal footage at the very beginning, it showed implied violence to babies and young children as well. Any film that's not afraid to push the envelope like that, I have to salute for it. Though for me, the best scene was the extended violent torture scene involving a hammer. Though the special effects are a bit suspect, the overall effect of the scene was really good. It's one of the better sequences I've seen a horror film, and for that scene alone, it should be given at least one star. And for a lower budget film, I was impressed with the special effects for the most part.
 Overall, I recommend this film for true horror fans. Yes, its got its problems, but with a decent atmosphere, violence, and special effects, its definitely worth a viewing.",1320019200,2,3805,4.390070921985815
3476184,3,B001AZIRYU,"This is a very ghoulish move and the director broke taboo after taboo after taboo but could not produce any theartrical value. So we got to see real footage of animals being brutishly tortured, so what the director got to depict the murder and violence against babies and childrem; so what we now know what it is like to really witness a hammer attack against a tied up women beginning to end....was that all that Bol wanted? Was this just taboo breaking oppurtunism without giving us plot twists, and exciting characters, interesting settings, complicated symbols. The director just wanted to excercise foul hood and the value was very thin. Watching a documentary about serial killers gives more value. There just wasn`t enough cinematic matter here to justify the crimes against humanity depicted here. 3 stars for stepping out of the normal taboos but that is all it was really good for.",1315094400,,891,4.9072847682119205

3476196,3,B001AZIRYU,"I was skeptical about this film for two reasons: 1- It's an Uwe Boll movie. 2- All three of the raves on the DVD box are from the same source. Well, I watched it and, um..., didn't absolutely hate it! It does lose a star for the (very real and extremely graphic) animal torture / killing footage at the beginning. I suppose its inclusion had something to do w/ SEED's internal darkness, but it could have been better used in a movie about animal abuse! Anyway, as horror movies go, SEED is only so-so. As a Uwe Boll movie, it's magnificent! Yes, it does tend to drag on in places, and there's that eternal, CGI-heavy, head-pulverizing sequence, but otherwise, SEED is actually OK. I was surprised at just how much I didn't despise SEED! It's even moved me to watch Boll's RAMPAGE! A miracle!...",1304726400,,794,4.520833333333333

I know Uwo Boll is a crappy at making films but this one was ok. I can't bost about it but i thought there were good moments. I liked the ending and the plot was good.

3476200,2,B001AZIRYU,"Let me get this out in the open before I go any further...I am an animal lover, and will generally place the value of an animals life in higher regard than most of the humans on this planet. I have truly seen what humans are capable of doing to one another, and for the most part, it disgusts me. With that out of the way, we get to this little gem. Seed begins with a completely useless and grossly unnecessary scene of raw animal abuse. These scenes were apparently supplied by PETA, so the authenticity of these should not be in doubt. The biggest crime here, is that we are given no warning of these to allow us to either skip to the next scene, or avoid it altogether. This negation of any kind of warning is inexcusable, as we are forced to become unwilling witnesses to this barbaric cruelty against our will. The only preface we get is a small notice that some scenes have been retained to protect continuity of the film. I am here to tell you that the animal abuse scenes serve absolutely no purpose to keep any kind of continuity whatsoever. Eschewing any decency for his audience, Uwe Boll rips the rug out from the get go, and leaves us paying mental money on a debt we didn't know we would owe. I found it extremely hard to focus on the film in any way after the first five minutes due to the degree of savagery I had just witnessed. Bottom line..Anyone who isn't bothered by the first five minutes is not someone I want to know. What follows the animal abuse is a very interesting, albeit faltered film involving Max Seed. A convicted killer who is about to be executed in a decrepit, and malfunctioning electric chair. A silly factoid we are shown at the beginning of the film instructs us that the state only gets three shots at electrocuting a convict, and after that, he is free. We go back and forth between past and present, and it is often hard to discern which period the film is currently in. This becomes bothersome and annoying, and takes away any shred of continuity that it may have ever had. I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that it took multiple viewings (obviously minus the first five minutes) to really get a feel for where the film was trying to go. In my opinion, the distribution company should have taken a page from Grindhouse releasings menu options for Cannibal Holocaust, which is another exercise in animal cruelty. The distributors gave the viewer the option of a ""cruelty free version"" in which they removed all animal cruelty from the movie, which allows you to view it in sequence, without having to grip the remote in your hand the entire time. I think Uwe Boll should re-examine what he considers necessary to add or include for continuity, because I think he has truly missed the boat here. If you choose to view this film, do yourself a favor, and skip the first chapter. You will thank me for it later..",1278633600,,2868,4.4543726235741445
3476201,1,B001AZIRYU,"PLEASE READ THIS! I collect horror movies. It is my hobby. I have seen 279 horror films in the last  years. I have seen everything and can sit through anything. I am never phased by anything. As a hard-core horror fan I write the following review. The movie Seed left me shocked, disturbed, nauseous, terrified, screaming and crying hysterically, in a state of pain and panic beyond anything I have ever experienced before. THIS FILM IS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING!!! The first 5 minutes of the film show REAL FOOTAGE OF ANIMAL TORTURE that was provided for the film by PETA. A man violently bashes a live raccoon on the ground and throws the limp, shivering body on the floor and violently kicks it over to a few other raccoons that have had the same fate. There is long graphic footage of a dog that has been completely skinned. The dog is bloody and gory in in horrible, visible pain. The dog is crying as his captors kick and hit his exposed body while he simply and visibly struggles to breath. There is a shot of a live mink having it's fur removed. After the fur has been ripped off it's body it's head is smashed on the ground. ALL THIS FOOTAGE IS REAL AND DISTURBING!!! That is just the first 5 minutes of the film. The film has many gory, graphic deaths including the murders of two babies. One baby is taken away from it's mother on a bus and its skull is bashed in against a pole. The other is shown starving to death. A reel time film shows the baby, locked in a basement, as it slowly starves to death with no food or water, and is crying painfully the entire time. Later in the film a woman is tied to a chair and her head is smashed in with a hammer. This sequence shows everything and lasts over 8 minutes. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AN DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! IT IS SICK AND DEMENTED AND IS NOT ENTERTAINING IN ANY WAY. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO UNWATCH THIS MOVIE SO AS TO REMOVE ALL THESE HORRIBLE IMAGES FROM MY MIND.

3476204,3,B001AZIRYU,"Let me start be saying that I am neither a fan or hator of Uwe Boll's work, I take each film as it comes and judge it on its own merits.  First off, the film is wonderful to watch and looks like it has a much higher budget than it does.  If there is anything postive to consistently say about Uwe Boll, he knows how to get a good shot.  That being said, the narrative out and out sucks.  While Seed is a contender to be one of the most viscious serial killers ever committed to film, his ability to be able to get to places without being seen or heard is completely ridiculous, which is especially apparent during the prison massacre.  Also, Michael Pare's character is particularly stupid.  Why go to a remote part of the woods in the middles of the night where there is no electricity or light to catch a brutal killer.  And then, to return there later, by YOURSELF, when there is much more at stake, is even more laughable.  Only Mr. Boll to blame here for this horrible script.  This could have been a really great film had it made more sense.  It is worth a watch for the graphic gore and high procuction values, but if a story that is completely coherent is your cup of tea, you might want to stay away from this one.  I honestly hope this film gets remade 20 years down the line with an awesome rewrite, until then, Mr. Boll, please take some creative writing classes as you can't do much worse.",1242950400,5,1402,4.252830188679245
3476205,4,B001AZIRYU,"A maniacal monster of a killer named Seed (Will Sanderson) who has conducted brutal murders and sick torture to innocent people and animals alike over the last 6 years with the most incredible record of mass murders ever is set to be executed. But after his execution and was buried, he is still alive as a supernatural maniac that still kills and even tortures his victims for Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Pare) is on the verge of destroying this sick and twisted killing machine.

A Nihlistic and gruesome horror thriller from the much hated director Uwe Boll is probably his best effort around. It's not based on a game much like his terrible ""House of the Dead"" or ""Alone in The Dark"" but he wrote produced and directed an original film of his own with inspiration of the recent glut of Torture Porn movies from ""Hostel"" and even some 70's grindhouse cinema movies. The opening sequence is very disgusting with footage of live animals being slaughtered for it's PETA footage that Boll borrowed as he wanted to make this a movie that plays as a statement on humanity and cruelty. There is horrific sequences of cruelty and torture such as a suffering baby being decompossed and a woman being tortured with an axe, it's definitely not for the faint hearted but a nice yet better film from Uwe Boll as he made one hell of a cruel movie.

This DVD has the unrated director's cut and of course some fair extras like audio commentary, a funny yet grueling short film about a filmmaker who tortures his critics, featurette, trailer and deleted scenes.

3476217,1,B001AZIRYU,"I can't believe this movie is actually legal.  There are REAL, I REPEAT REAL, scenes of animal torture, abuse, and death.  I personally did not make it past the first 2 minutes of this movie, but I read other reviews after my experience that said there are also scenes of a baby being abused and dying (FOR REAL).  Even though this is obviously very old footage, I am very surprised that the authorities have not ordered it destroyed so no one can actually use it.

Now, I do believe in the freedom of speech, so yes the footage is there and apparently it is legal to use it.  However, what I am most disappointed and frustrated about is there was ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING--not on the box, not on any websites selling the movie, or on any rental websites, and not even at the beginning of the movie itself (There is a warning that says something along the lines of disturbing content, but what movie these days doesn't have that warning.  They need to warn you that it is absolutely REAL!!!!)

It took me quite a while to get that 2 minutes of footage out of my head and this movie taught me to look at other reviews if I thought a movie might be similar to this, which I did for Cannibal Holocaust and was very thankful I did!",1235347200,6,1224,4.318777292576419
3476218,1,B001AZIRYU,"Seed (Uwe Boll, 2007)

I tend to be naturally attracted to rare things, so when word started circulating about the rarest of all things--an Uwe Boll movie that doesn't suck--I had to seek it out. Of course, the second I saw Michael Pare in a lead role, I had my suspicions that perhaps the ""good"" factor of Seed had been a little overplayed. Yet still I figured I'd check it out and see if there were any shred of truth whatsoever to the hypothesis, absurd on its surface, that Uwe Boll is, in fact, capable of directing a movie that might actually be watchable.

More fool me.

Seed was Boll's first non-videogame-based flick since he hit it ""big"" (relatively) with House of the Dead, which may account for some of the excitement. But, balancing that out, there's Michael Pare, who had a brief flirtation with success back in the mid-eighties after Eddie and the Cruisers, and has been trying to catch it again ever since. Unfortunately, Pare teamed up with Boll in 2005 (since then, Pare has appeared in four Boll joints), effectively sealing his doom. Here, he plays a Saw-like police detective who's obsessed with the case of Max Seed (Will Sanderson, in his fifth and, to date, last collaboration with Boll), a serial killer who reminds me of nothing so much as the main character in Rex Miller's novel Slob, except that Miller's novel has a plot and a timeline that actually makes sense, unlike Seed. As far as I could piece together, Pare's character (whose name is Matt Bishop, so I can stop saying ""Pare's character"") has been tracking Seed for a very long time, with all the friction with higher-ups and family problems and stuff you've seen in a million movies of this sort. Except that, wait, didn't Seed start this movie already in jail? How much of this is flashback? You'll never know, as the timeline in this movie jumps back and forth with no indication of transition whatsoever. In any case, whil I'd consider this a major spoiler, it's on the back cover; Seed goes to the electric chair, and (this part is not a spoiler, as the opening epigram sets it up) is jolted three times without dying. According to the law, he must be set free (there's some skullduggery afoot to stop this happening, but, you know). And Max Seed is not a forgiving man. No indeed.

It's actually a pretty slick plot and would have made a nifty little flick in the right hands, a sort of twisted combination of Shocker, the late-eighties Mitch Pileggi movie, and Robert Devereaux' wonderful novel Deadweight, but Uwe Boll doesn't have nearly the directorial chops to pull this off (despite coming off, relatively, his greatest triumph in In the Name of the King right before filming this). He also doesn't have a cast capable of pulling it off. Seed, who remains silent throughout the film save some grunts and growls, conveys far more emotion than most of these characters do with a full vocabulary. The lighting is uniformly dark and dreary, the sound is a but muffled, etc. All the tricks you're used to and pretty much expect from this kind of film, none of them delivered with any sort of originality or new twist.

So much possibility, so little realization. Avoid unless you're a serial killer completist. *",1233964800,4,3207,4.679078014184397
3476219,4,B001AZIRYU,"This film begins with disturbing scenes of actual animal torture, so all that follows has a little more gravitas than your average Slasher film. As I was watching this, I was trying to figure out who exactly Uwe Boll is angry at: capital punishment, corrupt cops, institutions in general? He has an axe to grind and he pulls out all the stops. If you watch the short film by another director, Uwe spells it out for us. The object of his anger is anyone who doesn't like his films, and, by extension, the person watching this film. He seems to be saying, you want a well-made film, you got it. But he wants to punish you along the way. Micheal Pare is pretty good in the lead and there is an especially mean-spirited killing scene. The music is basically 3 notes played over and over THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM, which is monotonous, but achieves the strange effect of making everything appear simultaneously, as though this is one long nightmare. If Jess Franco directed SAW, it would look a lot like this. Though well-made, this is pretty nasty entertainment. I don't think I'll ever watch it again, but I will watch the sequel.

3476223,5,B001AZIRYU,"Don't watch it...unless you're a veteran horror film connoisseur.  ""Seed"" exceeds any horror fanatic's expectations.  It goes beyond the limits of true horror and may set a precedent for a new genre' of film...one that only few will dabble in.  HORRIFIC!  EXPLICIT!  DISTURBING!  UNSETTLING!  STOMACH-TURNING!  So much terror that it brought tears to my eyes.  Honest!  I kept telling myself as the scenes unfolded...""no way...he's not going to do that...he's not going to do that!""  But he did...he did...again and again.

This is no joke.  ""SEED"" is the ultimate terror...horror...graphic...sick commentary on how insane criminals can have no remorse...no limit on pain and suffering...for life and limb...humans, animals...AUGHHH!  This film will make your skin crawl and you may never have another ""good night's sleep"".  Keep it away from the kids...the grandkids...people you love...even people you hate.

And to add insult to insanity, the DVD features a short film entitled ""Criticized""...about a horror movie reviewer (duh).  This 15-minute ditty was a perfect follow-up to the full-length feature.  It has changed my perspective on being critical of one's achievements...life or death.

One last warning.  No matter how much of a horror fanatic you may believe you are, be prepared for the next level if you venture into the ""Seed"".  I cried during a horror film?  They were tears of sheer terror.  But I give it a solid ""5"" because it achieves everything that horror stands for...",1227830400,8,1490,5.273504273504273

the story is about Max Seed A very sick killer was due to die on the electric chair but somehow did not die after 3 pulls of the switch so they buried his unconsious a** 6 feet under but he comes back looking for payback.

This has some turly nasty scenes if you don't like dogs and a baby being killed stay away form this film but for horror movie fans you will not be let down with what you see in this for me this is has become my suprise favorite horror film of 2008

The Good Things
*Includes the PC game ""Advent Rising."" Don't really know why, but it is a nice bonus (and it is a game I always wanted to check out).
*Video/sound quality are great.
*Includes a few special features; deleted scenes, some making-of footage, and trailers.
*The movie is downright disturbing, both graphically and brutally.  Expect lots of blood, gore, and torment.
*Production design is not bad.  Includes some interesting costumes, make-up effects, and some really wicked footage of living things decaying really fast.
*Cameramanship is interesting.  It is a little shaky and jittery, but also very fluid at other parts.
*Acting is not bad.  Writing is not bad, and utilizes one or two interesting ideas.  Has a few good lines.
*Music is not bad, as I recall.

The Bad Things
*Definately not for the squeamish, especially since the brutality is so strong.

The Questionable Things
*The storyline is rather thin, offering very little development in the events or the characters.  But, it is simple, straightforward, and moves along at an immersive rate.
*Includes some segments at the very beginning that appears to be actual PETA footage of animals being tortured.  It is very sick and disturbing.  But, it is very successful at invoking an emotional response.
*Very abrupt ending that leaves everything wide open (and may also leave you wondering what will happen next).
*The cover is kind of misleading, because the character you see there doesn't really appear anywhere in the film.  This, combined with the free PC game, makes the whole thing feel a little gimmicky.

It's an Uwe Boll film, so get ready for some screaming.  Fortunately, it won't be screams of anguish over the quality of the film; it will be genuine terror, because this film is extremely wicked, brutal, and somewhat invoking.  Granted, it still has a very weak story with a cast of weak characters.  But in the same league as ""Saw"" or one of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films, this film is simple, straightforward, and incredibly disturbing.  If you can stomach it, it is worthwhile seeing at least once.  At the very least, it will make you feel bitter and violated (which is good, because it invokes an emotional response, and brings up some good questions about humanity.  This is more than what can be said about most movies).",1224633600,15,2343,4.9311224489795915

This movie leaves nothing to the imagination and I am surprised it is not BANNED IN some countries but then again not. Because social media is available for free nowadays of some sick reality and this is just cgi fiction. The story line doesn't make much sense except what I got from it is- if you're a cop and see the destruction the man you finally have in custody/handcuffs, there's no point in going by the book and protocol you'll be making a mistake - shoot the beast in the head right then and there and make sure he is dead. That's the mistake the cop made in this movie. The movie was also about counter torture with the electric chair is it humane? Execute is a form of torture torturing the torturer but it's JUSTIFIED no doubt. The ending has to do with how our laws are set up for a death row inmate that's why lethal injection is much more accurate and unflawed. SEED is the killers name. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you are a seasoned horror flik buff and possibly even someone who has watched and sat through a real documentary on human beings  being TORTURED. unfortunately I have.

8280571,3,B001AZIRYU,"Seed is filmed in heavy atmospheric surrealism, blended with moments of splatter gore. Set in the 70s, the backdrop is as macabre and depressing as the notion of witnessing the life leave someone you love. The killer, Seed, is a large, terrifying force of cruelty and death, shown completely and utterly without remorse or compassion. The acting is pretty good in Seed. Most of the film is build on tense emotional interactions with limited dialog. The cinematography reminded me of Hellraiser: Inferno, with heavy noir elements. For me personally there is more that works here than goes wrong.

The special effects and soundtrack combine to give Seed that total horror feel. The slasher side of Bolls vision is strong in the kill/death sequences. Most are practical effects that really push the comfortability level-moving into heavy splatter / gore territory. The downside is that, in a couple of the scenes, CGI spoils the overall effect of realism that is created by most of the other deaths. Uwe Boll has a habit of taking the effects one step to far into the tacky where the CGI becomes too obvious to let the scene have a strong impact. Plus some of the sound effects, although very creepy and effect, seem like rip-offs of films that have come before Seed.",1431475200,,1264,4.851851851851852
