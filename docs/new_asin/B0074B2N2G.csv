5053905,5,B0074B2N2G,"Teen Spirit is about what truly does happen while you're in High School Hell.  It's starts with not remembering a student's name that has been in the same classes with you for 12 years.  It's all about who is going to be Prom Queen or the Queen's sidekick, or Ms. Most Popular.  Almost everyone out there has went through high school and its many tests about being a person, not just taking them to get a grade.  To pass you must acquire the skills to know how to win underhanded, where to hit them were it hurts, lie like hell, wear the right clothes, makeup, and hair while smiling through your whiten teeth.  Why does one have to go through such hell for four years and then leave and forget why you went through it all?  It does not make sense unless it was an agenda set up centuries ago to prepare you for the real world.  Teen Spirit has a great ending and it works.  It is worth the purchased to see teens who finally understand true spirit during those formative high school years.",1354320000,,990,4.313513513513514
