6890180,5,B00QXXKW6K,"I've seen Aviation Cocktail numerous times. Each time the film gets better! The writing, cast and film work is second to none. I recommend this movie to everyone!!",1422403200,6,163,4.857142857142857
6890181,5,B00QXXKW6K,"From 1950's Nebraska. This Thriller is beautiful.  David Higgins direction and the cast and look of the film is great.  It was WINNER! Best Feature Narrative, Trail Dance Film Festival, 2013.

6890183,5,B00QXXKW6K,"This is not a formulaic Hollywood story, and that is a good thing! The Aviation Cocktail explores the dark side of not addressing PTSD and the dangers of self medicating (with alcohol in this case) for a tight knit group of WWII veterans. It tackles a specific American region realistically, in this case the Nebraska Sandhills, without glossing over how events affect the wives and families of our heroes. Great music, acting and cinematography make this indie sleeper a must see for audiences interested in thought provoking cinema and not just another CG transforming robot.",1418774400,2,577,5.08421052631579

6890185,3,B00QXXKW6K,"The film starts out really exciting, but the action dies down after about only ten minutes and the rest of the film is rather dreary.  Many, MANY sound faults, and poor mix cuts, but overall the story was solid.  Making a feature length indie film is really really hard.  I do give props to the creator of the film, but it was dragged out way too long.  This plot would have worked better for a 30 to 40 minute film, rather than an hour and a half long film.",1484697600,,458,4.112359550561798
6890186,4,B00QXXKW6K,Most excellent indie film. Period piece set in the 50's with superb costuming and set decoration depicting the time. Small down rural America is depicted very well and the problems with PTSD seem very real and authentic. I though I was watching a big budget Hollywood film honestly with the variety and filming style. Kudos to all cast and crew for a job well done.,1471478400,4,365,4.630769230769231

6890217,5,B00QXXKW6K,"Every once in a while, an indie film really hits it out of the park. It's hard enough to do a period piece with a big budget, let alone an indie budget! Set against the backdrop of post-WWII Nebraska, three vets search out a serial killer. Such a good balancing act between the human interest in the characters, the intrigue and suspense. The filmmakers took some steps to add a feeling of darkness to the idyllic post-war days of America that really sets the mood. If you're a fan of period pieces or suspense, you won't want to miss this. And I think it's also a good bet for general audiences. I enjoyed this from start to finish, and highly recommend it.",1445817600,2,658,4.401639344262295

6890226,2,B00QXXKW6K,It had good props for a period movie and a few decent actors but it was mostly amateur hour.

6890228,2,B00QXXKW6K,"I tried to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, seeing that it is clearly an amateur film made with a very low budget and  but just couldn't get past the terrible acting and even worse dialogue. Every scene seemed so fake and forced. The sets didn't seem natural or realistic Though I do give them credit for trying. It can't be that easy finding 50's era stoves, cars. telephones, etc. Also, another reviewer mentioned that it seemed that everyone was smiling all the time and that the movie seemed to be a commercial for a dentist. I didn't notice the constant smiles but it did seem that all of the actors had unusually, extremely whitened teeth. What's up with that?",1441497600,,675,4.532786885245901

6890231,2,B00QXXKW6K,"High concept, great vintage cars, superb poster, too...but these top-level visual production values do not add up to a watchable film. Too bad, the story --at least as sketched in the description-- did seem really interesting to me. I lived in a small farming town just a few years after this era, and while I do appreciate what the production designer and set designer accomplished here [BIG APPLAUSE TO THEM] I couldn't stand the acting after 2 attempts to watch the first half hour, several days apart. This wasn't *personal taste*, the movie was really quite bad. Directing and of course, the writing, were seriously wanting. I kept seeing situations with no real core or no effect on me because so much of the acting was wooden. At first I thought it was misrepresented as parody, since the language in the first 1/2 hour, both times I tried to watch this film, was often weirdly off kilter, yet definitely not *of the period*. I'm a noir and indie fan, I enjoy giving even first-time directors and actors praise, in appreciation for novelty, quirkiness, or understated style. But this simply didn't merit it. Clearly, some relatives of the huge cast wrote in to bump up the ratings, because aside from great visuals, this movie was almost impossible to watch. Two stars instead of one because of the heroic work of the production designers.",1440547200,,1346,4.806034482758621

6890241,3,B00QXXKW6K,"The title is catchy, the scenery is pure Great Plains, and the vintage cars and planes are great.  However, it's best viewed as a journeyman effort, a step above a student effort but not a completely polished film.  As with any effort from early filmmakers, there are a couple of actors who stand apart from the rest, and of course, one or two that overact and a director not quite strong enough to rein them in.  I enjoyed it as a Prime member mainly because I'm familiar with that part of the country. People on either coast will likely not experience the mesmerizing attraction of the Plains, or the Sandhills area in particular, so for that reason and for the uneven pacing/acting, I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4, though I did like the film overall.

The summary of the film isn't particularly accurate.  There is very little evidence of PTSD here; rather, the characters show the usual difficulty fitting back into a peacetime society after they have been at war.  The ""serial killer"" aspect is incidental, and while there is some violence in the film, it's mainly implied, so viewers should not worry about potential PTSD triggers when viewing the film.",1437523200,3,1163,4.704433497536946

The only good thing is the vintage airplane which I suspect was the excuse for making the film. The producer wanted the plane and used the films budget to buy it.

6890259,3,B00QXXKW6K,"This is an original, thought-provoking, low budget film that shows the tragedy and despair of small town life in Nebraska in the 1950's. I thought the performances where good and the cast was attractive and compelling. Two characters in particular are driven over the edge by the somberness and lack of stimulation that small town country life has imposed on them. This film has a sort of ""Last Picture Show"" (Bogdanovich) feeling of dissatisfaction and despair, and also sort of an existential ""life is just made out of dirt"" message, to quote Lou Reed. This film is definitely not for the kiddies. Much effort went into the production and speaking of kiddies, the children's performances for example are very believable. The director is capable and always in control and it shows with good pacing and a consistent ""feel"". I thought the lighting was too harsh, but this is common in many films, low budget or not. I don't know if this is controlled by technique or equipment, but you get the spotlight effect on actor's faces sometimes. This is a mere technical note and nothing terrible but somewhat distracting. Because the actors are so young it has a community theatre look to it, but this is refreshing because we are all tired of seeing the same actors recycled over and over in Hollywood productions. Ive been viewing many documentaries lately just to get away from the same old stereotypical Hollywood talking heads. The DVD box implies an action or revenge flick but this is more of a thoughtful, if not sometimes violent character study with lots of interesting situations and generally well done. This won a film festival award, and rightly so.",1430438400,3,1656,4.875886524822695

The plot weaves around police brutality and the effect of alcoholism, loneliness and boredom in the townspeople.  The film used time appropriate sets, props ( especially the 50's cars) and had good camera work as well as a nice sound track. Having grown up in the 50's, there is a touch of reality to this portrayal of a time when all appeared to be innocent and in order on the surface but on closer examination was fulminating with conflict.
