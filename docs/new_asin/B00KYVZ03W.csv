6454130,2,B00KYVZ03W,I am so happy for Amazon Prime. This movie was so slow. I am happy I go it for free because I fast forwarded through most of the movie. It has a cute simple plot but was very hard for me to watch. I did like the idea of the movie,1502236800,,229,3.5098039215686274

6454135,5,B00KYVZ03W,This is feel good girly movie. It has simple romantic charm. Story isn't too complicated but this is what I needed. A simple story about love.

6454137,1,B00KYVZ03W,"The most awkward movie I have ever seen. The mother and that guy was like okay, but all the teenagers were acting weird and weren't really good  actors. If you're looking for something realistic, this is not for you. Most of this stuff is blown way out of proportion.",1496880000,,267,4.448979591836735
6454138,1,B00KYVZ03W,"The story is typical Hallmark Channel fluff which is ok if its Christmas time and those types of shows have some kind of silly Christmas charm. But this doesn't. The writing is awful. The acting is stiff but that might be due to the awful acting so I don't place all the blame for that on the cast. And the sound effects and music transitions and general feel of the film place it in the category of badly made indie film. I can do cheesy romance films, especially at Christmas time and on the Lifetime or Hallmark channels but this falls short of being charming.",1496102400,2,563,4.371428571428571

Teenager Hedley plays matchmaker for her widowed mother while dealing with her own love triangle and coping with the death of her father from a few years ago.",1481328000,2,261,4.326530612244898

6454163,4,B00KYVZ03W,This movie was entertaining. I love Lea Thompson!,1478995200,,49,5.25
6454164,4,B00KYVZ03W,"An enjoyable, feel good movie.  A teenage girl, Headly, who is still waiting for her first love, decides it is time her widowed mother find her own next love.  Mom and daughter are as close as sisters, but it takes a teen to see that her mom deserves more.  Enter the stealth matchmaking plan.  Headly and her best friend, space nerd Willis, make a fake video interview with Mom and send it to three men Headly has already checked out, based on the fact that two of them had dogs and the third had a little boy.

Headly meanwhile likes the cutest jock in school, who is also very attracted to her.  Willis sadly watches them flirting and circling, hating that he has no hope of turning his best friend into his girlfriend.  Mom actually does like one of the three men the kids selected for her and they begin dating.  You can probably guess the ultimate ending, but it was worth watching for some older actors I particularly like:  Leah Thompson (Carolyn in the City) and Sebastian Spence (First Wave).  Spence is attractive in a Brad Pitt kind of way, only with more character and, well, sentient...  Leah Thompson looks great and does her usual stellar acting job.  The kids, Matreya Fedor and Gig Morton do well with their fairly stereotypical roles.  Didn't knock my socks off, but I liked seeing the adult version of teen angst getting as much play as the actual teen version.

Fun movie.

P.S.  Spellcheck didn't like Headly and suggested a correction of Headless.  ;)  Gotta love spellcheckers.",1478908800,,1501,4.621212121212121

6454554,5,B00KYVZ03W,"This is really a TV movie chick flick, but for me it worked. The story line is predictable and there were a few quirky scenes. I liked the pace of this film. Both the ladies that starred in this have that girl next door quality and they certainly light up a room. Not overly religious but with family values. I thought that it was a well balanced feel good TV movie.",1440633600,,366,4.169014084507042

6454559,2,B00KYVZ03W,"Why would you say this was a good movie?

Ok, it's clean and there are good lessons, but it's so poorly acted and written.  Nothing and nobody is believable and you have to believe in order for it to be a good movie.

Just having good values or whatever is not enough to make a good movie!",1439856000,5,289,4.035087719298246

We predicted every single plot twist, but I was hoping the mom would end up with the black guy. There were also a lot of dogs in this film, and I liked that a lot. This Bogie guy is not a convincing love interest and we knew she would end up with Wollis (the guy who wore nothing but the universe). This 'Heather' chick was really annoying, but at least her mom was nice, though I think she pushed her dad in front of that bus...God bless this film.
