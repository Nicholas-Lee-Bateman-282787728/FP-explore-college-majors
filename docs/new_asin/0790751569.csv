115864,5,0790751569,"I had never seen this movie before, but when I did, I knew that I had to buy it.  Clint Eastwood stars as a wild west show performer with a checkered past.  You even get to hear Clint sing with Merl Haggard on  Barroom Buddies!  A great movie for all.",960854400,,251,3.96

115871,2,0790751569,"Pulp Fiction is 5 out of 5 stars in my book.  On Amazon, it receives 4.6/5 stars.  The idea that Bronco Billy (4.4/5 stars on Amazon) is anywhere near as good a movie as Pulp Fiction is ridiculous...it doesn't even crack Eastwood's own top 10 movies!  Bronco Billy has little redeeming value even from a pure entertainment perspective which is difficult to say about almost every other Clint Eastwood film.  The only Eastwood movies I can think of which might be worse are those country and western orangutan movies he did in the late 70's.",1485734400,,540,4.652631578947369

115974,4,0790751569,"Clint Eastwood demonstrates his diversity as an actor in Bronco Billy.  Viewers expecting to see him in one of his bad boy roles will be disappointed, but the movie is certainly not disappointing (other than Sondra Locke's presence).",1398470400,,233,5.131578947368421

115976,5,0790751569,This is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies. He is a cowboy that entertains with a Wild West Show with a cast of misfit characters that he believes in.,1395705600,,151,4.241379310344827

115981,5,0790751569,This is a tribute to Carnivals and Cowboys a day when the USA society was much more serene than now. We could get back if WE REALLY WANTED a BETTER AMERICA where we didn't need 'Dirty Harry' or see Guns in schools. I believe Mr. Eastwood is sending a message for us to see in his films.........Whatta Think Huh??,1381104000,,312,4.305084745762712

115983,4,0790751569,"First off, I feel horribly guilty about giving Clint anything but a 5 star rating, but...

This movie just didn't really do that much for me at all.  He is a traveling circus owner and that is about it.  No really, thats about it.  The movie has a really good moral and all that.  I would compare it to the serious movie Will Ferrel did where you just kept expecting him to break out into his usual character but never did.",1376352000,,423,4.172839506172839

116006,4,0790751569,"What I expected to be an average movie experience at best turned out to be a truly entertaining film. Bronco Billy really delivered a memorable story. Though it's truly offbeat for Eastwood, he fits into the character of Billy perfectly and delivers a perfect performance. Clint is just great in the role. In fact the entire cast does a great job and the characters they play slowly become those that you actually care about and enjoy watching. This is not Oscar stuff here, but this film will surprise you because you might not expect much at all considering the subject matter revolving around a bunch of ""down and out"" circus performers trying to make a living. Sondra Locke delivers what I believe to be her best performance, and gives life to what could have easily been a really forgettable character. She can play a b**ch great, but also delivers a convincing portrait of transformation to a more likable person. Also (as usual) Scatman Crothers does a very good job. I really admire many of his performances and fans of Mr. Crothers will like him in this film a great deal even though his part is less majestic than others he has played. All in all this movie is worth watching. I felt it was really a really fun and entertaining film that I will likely remember over numerous other Eastwood movies. It was a real treat seeing Clint play this role to perfection.",1368144000,4,1370,4.6419753086419755

116008,5,0790751569,"While Clint Eastwood is noted for his grit your teeth westerns, this one is just a little bit different. It still has the fast shooting and horse riding as other westerns but with a twist. He's not from the west! Always enjoyed this movie.",1365724800,,239,4.454545454545454

116013,3,0790751569,I love everything Clint Eastwood.  And I like Westerns/cowboys etc.  The story was simple.  Not one of Clint's best.  But I had to have it.  No regrets.  I collect his movies.,1361491200,,175,4.483870967741935
116036,5,0790751569,Enjoyed this very much. Different from his usual films of the time. Apparently Clint was a fan Of the serial Another World; the villainess Iris was played by the talented Beverlee McKinsey. Well she was cast in this as the villainess Irene. She did a fine job too.,1360972800,,264,4.520833333333333
116037,4,0790751569,Bronco Billy is that different movie of Clint Eastwood's that you have been looking for. It's definitely different but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good for all ages.,1353888000,,162,5.037037037037037

116039,1,0790751569,Bronco Billy is bland and corny.  It is not funny.  I only laughed once.  It is boring. It is not believable.  It is similar to a bad situation comedy.,1340928000,,151,4.103448275862069

116041,4,0790751569,"Clint Eastwood began to experiment with his acting range in the '70s. After being a cowboy for pretty much his first 13 years, he then gravitated into action/crime. Then along came some comedy...and finally another (almost)cowboy with tenderness attached. A fine cast rounds out a very enjoyable movie for all ages.",1306800000,,315,5.196078431372549

116043,5,0790751569,"I saw this movie many years ago and it lived up to my memory in every way. It is funny, warm and absolutely sincere, not a send up of the high moral standards Billy lives by. When Clint Eastwood won an academy award a few years ago he mentioned in his acceptance speech that he knew people would eventually come around to his way of thinking, so imagine my delight when he said the exact same words as Bronco Billy in this charming movie.",1296691200,,438,4.226190476190476

116045,5,0790751569,"I love this movie. It's about Bronco Billy (as portrayed by Eastwood), being the boss, or ""ramrod"", in a modern day, ""Wild West Show"". Bronco Billy has a team of performers, that are in his traveling show. Billy has a hidden past, but he really loves this traveling ""Wild West Show"" stuff. The performers in Billy's show, trust him and are loyal to him. He loves being a role model to kids, in these traveling shows. Somehow, Bronco Billy crosses paths with a rich, New York, Socialite, heiress to a rich inheritance. She is caught up in a conspirosy, of her own. Anyway, she joins the show, and that really shakes things up, but everything ends  with a happy ending. This is a great movie that will give you, that ""good feeling"", at the end. Clint Eastwood, himself, has stated, that this is one of his all time favorite movies. Buy it, watch it, you'll love it!!! Thanks!!!",1284163200,,875,4.537974683544304

This is a funny movie with a hokey style, a lot of charm, and a heart of gold - like Bronco Billy!  The chemistry between him and Miss Lily is pretty good.  Miss Lily's first husband kind of cracked me up too - I haven't seen that guy in ages. It's not a laugh a minute, though there are more than a few, esp in terms of acting and situation, plus it just carries steam and plugs along throwing out nuggets of wisdom here and there that just kind of make you feel like they might know what they're talking about!  Clint is in great form here and I think it's so cool that the baddest-@ssed cowboy this side of Hollywood and the River Pecos could set aside time for a no-nonsense charmer like this one.  Livin' the dream!  I like most Clint Eastwood movies though outside ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" and ""Dirty Harry"", I like his more obscure stuff too, like ""Paint Your Wagon"", ""Two Mules for Sister Sarah"", and ""The Beguiled"".  Bronco Billy is kind of a return to the time when Clint smiled on screen.  A very original 70s gem (actually 1980), well worth catching.  Don't go in expecting too much and you'll probably come out pleased and feeling a little brighter.",1269302400,4,1208,4.357142857142857

All the actors did a fine job and it was beautifully photographed.  I would recommend this film for those who enjoy a humorous, mildly campy look at a life full of possibilities.

The plot reminds me of one of those romantic Westerns. (I'd like to say something more about the plot though--it got a little silly at times and somethings didn't make much sense, such as when/how did he fall in-love with Sondra Locke's character?)

But I felt the character of Sondra Locke was too annoying--mean spirited and annoying. I couldn't like her character even when she changed.

In general my favourite Eastwood's films are the ones with his smart female partner Sondra Locke: Bronco Billy, Every which way but loose and Sudden Impact.",1251072000,,482,4.950617283950617

This isn't just my favorite Eastwood film. It's one of my all-time favorite - period! That's probably because it has tremendous charm, with a good mixture of comedy and drama with characters you care about. It's definitely different from most of Clint's movies.

The famous Eastwood glare when he's mad is still there, and he still shows his violent side. However, it's not a violent story, just a tale of a modern-day man and his little troupe who want to play cowboys and Indians, and go on tour with their little Wild West show.

The film has nice, colorful photography and looks great on DVD. However, the story, not the visuals, is the main attraction. It's refreshing to see Eastwood play a role like this where he's a Mr. Rogers-type western hero for little kids, urging children to stay on the straight and narrow, mind their parents and say their prayers before going to bed at night.

Sondra Locke also is effective as the cold newcomer who reluctantly joins the group and slowly changes from a mean-spirited, sarcastic woman to a caring person. She shows a good comedic touch and is excellent in this film, perhaps her best effort since ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter.""

The rest of the cast is fun to watch, too, and the always-fascinating face and voice of ""Scatman"" Crothers.

I've said this for 20 years, but I still think it's Eastwood's most underrated movie.",1233187200,,1575,4.688405797101449
116097,4,0790751569,"Bronco Billy is a character in the tradition of classic westerns of the 20th century.  Billy is fair and honest, and he watches out for children.  Except for some of the things he does, Bronco Billy bears some resemblance to Roy Rogers.  However, when Billy does not get his way, which seems to happen a lot, he can be manipulative.

One of Bronco Billy's biggest problems is getting a young woman to be an assistant.  Being an assistant for Billy involves being a target for knives, holding up plates so Billy can shoot them, and jumping on the back of a horse ridden by Billy.  Billy's latest assistant just quit at the same time that obnoxious Antoinette Lilly's husband abandons her in the same town Bronco Billy's wild west show is playing.  Antoinette needs help, since all her husband left her was a nightgown, and
Billy needs an assistant.

Antoinette turns out to be a huge pain in the behind.  She is smart-mouthed, cynical, obnoxious and arrogant (I may have missed a few adjectives, but you can fill those in yourself).  On the other hand, Antoinette can shoot and other than being a snob, she can handle the assistant part.

Even though I am not a big fan of Sondra Locke, part of what makes this movie work is how Antoinette's observations of Billy slowly change her attitude toward the world.  She sees that Billy is honest and caring.  She also sees how selfless Billy and his team are.  Between the jokes, the changes in Antoinette as the movie progresses are important to the end of the movie.

Whenever I look at my DVD collection for a movie to watch, I somehow seem to always pass over this movie.  Yet, when I finely get around to watching it, I am always glad I did.  I am unable to explain exactly why that is the case.  Regardless, this movie is a charmer and one of my favorite Clint Eastwood comedies.  If you have enjoyed Clint Eastwood's other comedies, I believe you will like this one.

116098,4,0790751569,"Despite its mixed reception and disappointing box-office, Eastwood's Bronco Billy may not be the blockbuster the studio pitched it as (it was released on the largest number of screens ever at the time) but it's certainly not the disaster it's sometimes painted. A Thirties-style screwball comedy about an ex-shoe salesman and his band of misfits and dreamers whose travelling show becomes the hideout for a runaway heiress (a miscast and very unsympathetic Sondra Locke, whose conversion to proletarian good naturedness is the film's most unconvincing note). With a strong supporting cast including a scene-stealing Geoffrey Lewis as Locke's money-grabbing husband and a genuine warm-hearted affection for its characters that's only enhanced by its awareness of their failings, it remains one of his most winning and certainly his most underrated films.",1203120000,,853,5.569230769230769
116099,4,0790751569,"I've always liked this film a great deal and I can't honestly say why.  It's hardly a memorable achievement in terms of filmmaking.  However, there is something so true and honest about Clint's Bronco Billy that has never failed to grab me.  He plays the everyday man dragging along his childhood dream and wanting to be, at the very least, someone with something to offer, regardless of how silly it may be.  There's this open sincerity in both his performance and direction, that though the latter sometimes slips into corny territory, manages to elevate the film into more than respectable territory; the cheesy elements never overwhelm the film as much as they punctuate it.  Frankly, I like Sondra Locke and don't really understand what all the negative comments are about.  She plays the ultimate New York socialite snob to perfection:  Bored, bitter, with the uncanny ability to dismiss anyone and everyone with equal indifference.  The rest of the rag-tag crew is uniformly adept at communicating their disparate, yet somehow common, pasts.",1187136000,2,1048,5.087719298245614
116100,4,0790751569,"This film is quite corny at times, but it's sincere, and that makes up for a lot of the corn.  Clint (who also directs) plays a cowboy in charge of an old fashioned, travelling rodeo show.  He has a bunch of rag tag people in his company, but they have a deep sense of community, and they do care for each other.  Billy ends up in many jams in this film, but his ""family"" stick it out, with a little help from the people around the country that Bronco Billy has performed for before.  They even take in a rich ""b**tch"" character (played by Sondra Locke, then Clint's girlfriend), and she's a bit much at times, but she isn't nearly as bad as others have said she is.  The film is shot on location in the upper Northeast (specifically Idaho), and it really enhances the film.  There isn't a trace of ""irony"" or any smugness here, which really helps the film in the long run.  Clint has said in many interviews that he really liked this film, and that it is one of his personal favorites.  He thought it could combat the prevailing cynicism of the day.  The song over the end credits is really cheesy, but the film itself is nicely done.

A funny note.  Scatman Crothers did this film shortly after completing his work on Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.  For those who don't know, Scatman played the chef who has the power of shine like Danny.  Kubrick was notorious for doing many takes in all his films, but on The Shining the take ratio was astronomical.  In reading about the filming, take totals went as high as 148 on some of Scatman's shots.  I read that on the first day of shooting on Bronco Billy, Scatman got his scene on the first take, and Clint said ""let's move on"", and Scatman almost broke down in tears because he was so happy and relieved.  I like that story, and this film.",1182556800,5,1789,4.343373493975903

BRONCO BILLY, shot in 1980, is a good surprise for the Eastwood fan. Starring Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis Scatman Crothers, Sam Bottoms and Clint, the movie has all the ingredients of a good comedy. Witty and heartful. The show presented by Clint and his friends is hilarious and the relations between Bronco and the children very well developed.
