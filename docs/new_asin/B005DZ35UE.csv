4663288,1,B005DZ35UE,"This years Thomas Christmas special is nothing special at all!!!
It is no different than last years ""Merry Christmas Wish"".
Sir Topham Hatt still dresses up as santa and wishes everyone a ""Merry Winter Holiday""!!!
SERIOUSLY????!!!!! The kids looked at me and asked ""when is winter holiday mom??""""
Whats up w a beautiful series that was created by a REVERAND now being PC'd out to death!!!!
Bring back the old Thomas please, Im just not buyin anymore.",1320796800,4,450,4.857142857142857
4663289,4,B005DZ35UE,"In our house its not Christmas, without trains and what better way to start off the holiday season than with a Christmas Thomas & Friends DVD!  I have a feeling too that we will be watching this DVD long past Christmas too.  It is a cute DVD with just enough episodes to keep my boys attention and all the episodes feature wholesome lessons of course!  The episodes feature snow, a snowman, Christmas trees, presents, lights and basically got my boys very excited about Christmas!",1320710400,7,480,4.690476190476191
4663290,1,B005DZ35UE,"This ""Merry Christmas, Thomas!"" DVD IS DIFFERENT than last year's ""Merry Winter Wish"" DVD.  There are different episodes.

This DVD ""Merry Christmas, Thomas"" contains the following episodes:
* ""Let It Snow""
* ""Surprise, Surprise""
* ""Percy and the Snowman""
* ""Tree Trouble""

While the ""Merry Winter Wish"" contains the following episodes:
1. Merry Winter Wish
2. Thomas and the Snowman Party
3. Henry's Magic Box
4. Merry Misty Island

HOWEVER...

IT'S STILL THE SAME HORRIBLE ""MERRY WINTER HOLIDAYS"" COMING FROM SIR TOPHAM HATT!!  PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE DO NOT BUY.  LET'S BOYCOTT THIS HORRIBLE POLITICALLY CORRECT NONSENSE!!!!",1320105600,22,633,5.670212765957447
4663291,2,B005DZ35UE,"How is this dvd different from last year's ""Merry Winter Wish""?? I haven't actually seen this one, but it seems like its the exact same episodes, including the one where  Sir Topham Hatt dresses as Santa and exclaims ""Happy winter holiday!"" instead of saying ""Merry Christmas!""",1319846400,6,277,5.021739130434782
4663292,1,B005DZ35UE,"If I could, I would return for a refund.  At first, I was annoyed by the fact that you can't skip the ads, only fast foward through them, so the kids still see the products.  Then I realized that even though the packaging says Merry Christmas and calls it a ""magical Christmas collection,"" the episode on the DVD are about ""winter holidays,"" NOT Christmas.  Even Sir Topham Hat dresses as Santa and wishes the children of Sodor Island ""Happy Winter Holidays!""",1319760000,30,459,4.6419753086419755

I love when they come out with new Thomas movies and my son gets so excited!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merry-Christmas-Thomas/dp/B005DZ35UE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merry Christmas Thomas</a>",1318809600,3,287,8.6
4663304,3,B005DZ35UE,"I was disappointed in this DVD.  My son loves the train episodes in it, but in between each episode is part of a random skit with an actual human actor (rather than animation).  He is supposed to be Thomas's conductor and he can't figure out how to get coal for the furnace inside the train station rest area.  My son hated these segments and just kept asking for ""more choo-choos"".  Since the product description focused on the train episodes and not this random aside, I wasn't expecting it and taken off guard.  Had I known, I would have purchased a different Thomas Christmas DVD that focused more on Thomas and his train friends.",1482278400,,634,4.575221238938053

4663324,1,B005DZ35UE,"NOTHING BUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS ""WINTER HOLIDAY"" - NO MENTION OF ""CHRISTMAS"" ANYWHERE!!! When a DVD says ""Christmas"" on the case and ""Winter Holiday"" 100 times over on the DVD, you know you're a victim of bait and switch. How sad the entire DVD has nothing but ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"", ""Winter Holiday"" - I finally had enough and threw it in the garbage!!! HOW SAD they feel the need to shove this PC crap down the throats of little children!

UPDATE 11/17/2014: Hallelujah!!! If you want a Thomas Christmas DVD that hasn't replaced the word ""Christmas"" with ""winter holiday"" (even though Christmas is the only holiday that includes Santa and his reindeer and sleigh and a tree with Christmas lights) order the DVD ""THOMAS & FRIENDS ULTIMATE CHRISTMAS"" (Search ASIN: B001O2UTOK)where you will find ""Christmas"" thankfully has not been replaced by the idiotic winter holiday (probably because the episodes are from the early 80s and 90s before the big push ""CHRIST"" became so offensive.",1415318400,3,1177,5.396739130434782

4663329,5,B005DZ35UE,My son is really into Thomas the Train and loves watching the movies/shows. This one was perfect for the holiday season.,1390089600,,120,4.761904761904762
4663330,5,B005DZ35UE,"There was nothing I disliked about Merry Christmas, Thomas.  Britt Allcroft and those that bring Thomas to life on the screen deserve all the praise there is.  There is nothing silly or animated about the Thomas stories, only excellent life lessions for children of all ages to learn.  I even enjoy watching the Thomas films with my grandson, they are so well-done and have great story lines.  This only adds to the happiness and warmth of a family Christmas.",1389139200,3,459,4.772151898734177

4663336,1,B005DZ35UE,"You know how this is: your kids bug you to put in a DVD for them. You put in the DVD and wait until the copyright warning is over, and the various logos of producers and distributors finished, before you can finally hit Play. Most Thomas DVDs add more annoying ""buy more Thomas DVD"" trailers.

Ok - I can just about bear this, but this DVD just puts it over the top. The DVD starts with a barrage of commercials for various pink plastic toys - which never wants to end. Why am I exactly paying for this DVD? To have the pleasure to watch commercials?

And not just that: after you started the DVD for the kids, you usually go about your thing and come back when your kids report the DVD over. At the end of the Thomas video part, this DVD keeps on repeating commercials - in an endless loop.

If you like watching commercials, and you are willing to pay for this privilege, this is the right product for you. If you think that the young minds of your kids are too precious to be insulted by cheap commercials sneaked into a children's DVD, a privilege you are paying for, better skip Merry Christmas Thomas.",1367020800,17,1107,4.287081339712919

4663339,1,B005DZ35UE,"With five young kids, I've seen my share of corny, cheesy, and dumb kiddie videos.  This one could be the worst.  The ""plots"" are stupid, and the characters talk in bad rhymes and annoying voices.  I think my kids IQs dropped 10 points after watching this. We were watching it free with Amazon Prime, turned it off halfway, and willingly dealt with the two year old's protests at the video being turned off, because enduring a toddler tantrum is MUCH preferable to watching this video.",1356134400,,485,4.682352941176471
