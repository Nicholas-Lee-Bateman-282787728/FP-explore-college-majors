8280121,3,B001AXTUQQ,"This is a decent story about a guy who was engaged to get married, but the bribe-to-be ran away right before the wedding.  The guy was deeply in love with his potential wife according to him and was willing to kill himself for losing her.  So, he tells his best friend who is a gangster guy who killed a few people in his life to kill him in the next few days without offering any notice.  His friend eventually takes him up on the offer, but he also made his friend make a promise that no matter what happens even if he changes his mind to not die, his friend must kill him anyway.  They spend a weekend up at his family's mountain home.  While there, he meets various characters while waiting for his own death that will be planned out at the discretion of his best friend.  The questions will be: is he going to still want to die or will he change his mind, and will his friend kill him no matter what or will his friend not carry out his promise?  That remains to be seen at the end of the story.

Overall, the acting was okay as they all seem like first time actors.  For a low budget film, this was a decent story and the actors played their part. This is not Asian Stories as it is just one story.  I thought there would be many mini stories in this film, but it's just one long story.  Though this is an Asian film because all the main actors are Asian-American, the movie is completely in English and takes place in the United States.  This did not have to be an Asian story as it was not cultural, it could have been anyone's story.  The title is a bit misleading.",1486080000,,1574,4.1381578947368425
8280122,2,B001AXTUQQ,"I wanted to like this movie but was disappointed. The characters are superficial. In particular, the store clerk and the pizza delivery guy tried to hard to act eccentric but ended up looking fake. The plot is shallow and boring. This movie never went beyond the level of an amateur college film project.
*** spoiler alert ***
One atrocious plot hole near the end is that the main character expected someone to come to his house to kill him that night. He decides, of all the places to be, to stay in his house -- albeit staying awake and holding a frying pan.",1471219200,,560,4.446601941747573

8280125,5,B001AXTUQQ,"I was expecting less - way less, but it was actually DAMN GOOD!

I never heard of this movie before and it wasn't promoted at all or barely promoted. I only came across it because I wanted to see all or almost all Asian American films. This film somehow managed to show up on my Netflix recommendation and I'm glad it did. I rented it and I loved it! I watched it more than a few times, and I usually do that for movies.

This is a way low-budget film and it managed to be better than the some high budget films I seen. There's no special effects or 3d graphics in this movie - all there is an awesome story line, acting skills, and great directing. The actors really made me believe their character. Also, a well written script goes a long way. There were a bunch of humor in it. It's like everything a person would want in a good high budget movie, but  they used ""less money"" to make it.

I say everyone that like these little independent Asian American films should BUY or RENT this one! This one actually worth it.",1335657600,2,1019,4.21025641025641
8280126,4,B001AXTUQQ,"James Kyson Lee proves he can carry a film as a leading man.  Fortunately, he's also in good company with fellow actors to share the screen with, an amusing script that allows for physical comedy (mostly physical reactions) and a director who knows how to move the story along.

Jim Lee (JKL) was due to be married to the woman he loved, only she's run off with the Filipino DJ who was going to be performing at their reception.  If you're not familiar with Chinese culture, it's like pouring salt onto an open wound.  A friend takes him on trip to get away from it all and it's there he meets a wouldbe girlfriend.  Unfortunately, Jim has also asked his friend (who happens to be an assassin) to murder him before Valentine's Day.  With the date looming just ahead and the potential for love on the horizon, anything could happen.

The only complaint I had was the dramatic and somewhat violent final act that felt as if it came out of nowhere before settling back down.  Fortunately, it doesn't last as long as it could have and doesn't take away from the film much.

All in all, very enjoyable, especially with Composer George Shaw's score complimenting it.",1221955200,,1160,4.565217391304348
8280127,4,B001AXTUQQ,"Rare Asian American Comedy.  Very funny, great script writting and love the way it captures the stereotypes.  A little exaggerated perhaps but that's what makes this film funny.",1218931200,,177,5.285714285714286
