276266,2,6300248690,"Don johnson, like many major stars, begins stepping over the line of good judgement or good taste by taking this peculiar stroll out of the safe confines of acting.
  Like a long list of others before him (Eddie Murphy, William Shatner, Jim Carrey )Don Johnson seems to have come down with a show business virus known as the 'singing bug'. Mercifully, this is usually short lived, and the actor recovers somewhat wiser.
  Johnson, to his credit does at least possess something his peers usually don't, and that is his mediocre singing voice, which is at least somewhat forgivable.
  The other thing he posesses is acting ability, and he puts it to great use in this video as he tries somewhat dramatically to act like a pop/rock singer.
  Obviously Miami Vice inspired. The song itself inspires sleep.",1001894400,,801,4.838235294117647

7807284,4,6300248690,"actually this was a very good copy. I had lost mine during a move decades ago and having recently acquire a small VHS player I used for VHS player for many of my VHS tapes I had not found a DVD replacement for. This is a story of great importance since it tapped deeply into many of the cultures I had grown up in. It touched on the barrios my friends came from and the losses showing the deep friendships, dark fights for territory, those trying not to participate. Then the way war affected not just soldiers but journalists, civilian support and some of the ways it affected marriages, the need to be working long hours simply to keep away the memories, no matter how many years since they came home. Then their were memories of imperfect childhoods, as well as how the elderly rotate through their memories keeping those that still made them smile and who and why they may st8ll be their heroes. Throughout this musical movie Don Johnson showed superb acting and musical ability. The list of performers are amazing. Those already famous, easily recognizable while decades later they have reached a new level of fame where it is movies, TV or music. My best memory had been of Willie Nelson and Don Johnson  doing a duet. Each segment was deeply rooted in in an experience that even decades later I could still drop into full memory. He alluded to and yet full emotion was in every scene. Still I wish the DVD was available at a reasonable price simply because DVD remakes are always an improvement over the older VHS. This  movie also shows Don Johnson as an accomplished actor, singer and can drop into an emotional state that few can even to this day. He really is accomplished with great friends that are in this movie.",1488931200,,1726,4.546623794212219
7807285,4,6300248690,"I could be mean and say that Don Johnson had probably watched Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz"" a few too many times, but I've done that myself, so why should I complain about that? Variously put down in these reviews as ""cheesy"" or ""self-indulgent,"" this work is actually well-conceived and well-executed. I take away a single star only because I'm not entirely into all of the musical forms (e.g., semi-rap ""Streetwise""); the story and film, however, is really very good. Johnson's voice is nothing to sneeze at either; the reviewer to compared him to Shatner (primarily in terms of ""catching the singing bug"") is dead wrong. Johnson has a good range, good delivery, and although perhaps not quite as polished as some who are primarily singers, he (so to speak) delivers good bang for the buck. The ""long-form rock video"" accomplishes a fair amount of subtlety overall, letting the songs and visuals tell the tale rather than bogging it down with excess dialog. I'd very much like to see CBS Video pick this up even if only as a streaming or a press-on-demand DVD; I'd buy it. As it is, have a copy on Beta (yeah, so sue me) taken from HBO, and my Beta player hasn't survived the years all that well. It's a worthy part of the DJ canon and shouldn't be overlooked or dismissed.",1481673600,,1273,4.612334801762114
7807286,3,6300248690,"The 2-star review here is pretty evenhanded evaluation of this vanity project (and that's clearly what this is), but I'm giving this video an extra star for my gooey nostalgia for all things 'Miami Vice' (yes, I once owned an electric blue blazer with shoulder pads).

Technically, this nearly-feature length music video is well-directed, although it feels VERY much of its time. (Anyone trying to ape an '80s rock video style need look no further.) But then there's the conscious decision to have no dialogue (ooooo!), the au courant ""political"" angle (someone had clearly just seen Oliver Stone's ""Salvador""), the whole afterlife sequence (everyone's in white!), the egregious (and ultra-cheesy) climactic sex scene with Lori Singer (I think that's her naked boob in there), Giancarlo Esposito as a racially ambiguous street tough/bad-a**...oh, it just goes on and on.

Mmmm...delicious cheese...",1403568000,,898,5.4071428571428575
7807287,5,6300248690,"I just purchased this recently.  It is a great display of the versatile talent of Don Johnson.  If you haven't seen it you really need to.  Since it is VHS it is old (from 1987) but it plays wonderfully, no deterioration.  I'm lucky to have a VHS to DVD recorder so I was able to  transfer it to DVD.  I want to make sure it lasts forever.  I really can't say enough about this.  I can honestly say that I will never hear ""Voice on the Hotline"" the same again.",1383609600,2,460,4.033333333333333
7807288,5,6300248690,"Shortly after Don Johnson made a big splash in the Miami Vice TV series, he made this hour long music video, and damn it I've always liked it.  I liked it in 1987 and still do in 2007 & 2012.  This tells a story of a photographer who is injured while covering a rebellion in some presumably South American country.  The girls are all hot and the cast features many who were well known then (Sandahl Bergman, David Carradine) and some who went on to more fame later (Giancarlo Esposito, Lori Singer) and even Paul Shaffer from The Late Show.

While Don Johnson does not have a classically great voice, it's just fine for pop and rock 'n roll.  Give the guy a break.  Johnson is one of those actors who appeals to both men and women.  Watch for some very steamy sex scenes.  Some good tunes too, with backups by Willie Nelson and the Zappa siblings. I actually have this on a rare laserdisc.",1350259200,,889,4.345454545454546
7807289,5,6300248690,"Been looking for this for sometime.  Apparently could only find it in VHS.  Yes it is dated material but back in its day it was really relevant.  By the way, seller had a good VHS version of this",1339113600,,195,4.078947368421052
7807290,5,6300248690,"hi

thank you seller.",1337644800,,339,3.9558823529411766
7807291,5,6300248690,I loved this when I saw it on TV the first time and had to have I am not disappointed.,1241654400,,86,3.35
7807292,5,6300248690,"Of all the 80's actors etc, don johnson would have to be one of the best, he has a great voice, he's has a better voice than david hasselhoff, and it makes me wonder why he's making it and don isn't, don johnson should've stuck to music, as his voice is like golden.
I remember watching ""Heartbeat"" years ago, it was great, it was a different way of doing it, but overall it's great. janet jackson did something like this to ""Rhythm Nation"".My Favourite song would have to be ""Can't Take Your Memory"" that song hangs with me and would have to be don's finest work overall.",1207267200,,572,4.355140186915888
7807293,5,6300248690,"A great long form video that first premiered on HBO.  No dialog...just a visual story set to the lyrics of the very underrated album of the same name.  Look for Lori Singer, Paul Shaffer, Luis Guzman, Angela Alverado, David Carradine and many others.  ""Streetwise"" is featured, a song that appeared in a Miami Vice episode but not on the Heartbeat album.  This needs to be out on DVD!",1151366400,3,384,4.602941176470588
