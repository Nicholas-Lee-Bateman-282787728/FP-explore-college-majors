5315348,3,B009CCL7S6,"This is another poor quality Fox Archive release. the picture is very soft and dark. In some of the dark scenes,
you cannot even see the actors. If Fox cannot be bothered to produce a decent copy, why do they bother at all.
They introduced Cinemascope to the world, in all its widescreen splendour, but insist on producing
pan and scan versions for Archive release!
Warner Archive and Sony/Columdia produce first rate copies of their MOD releases, so why can't Fox?
They probably do not even read all the negative reviews posted on Amazon.",1353888000,22,539,4.74468085106383
5315349,3,B009CCL7S6,"The color print on this for ""Fox Classic"" is awfully dark.  Some one should have checked the negative and done something about it.  I've read other people's comments about some of the other fox reissues and that shouldn't be tolerated.  The plot is pretty humdrum and hackneyed.  Ameche plays Foster.  He writes songs  Al Jolson playing E.P. Christy sings them well, but if you have trouble with minstrel shows with people in black face and find it a dreadful stereotype, you might be offended even though it is historically accurate.  Foster drinks himself to an early grave.  Jolson saves the movie and only wears blackface when he is performing, not in the dramatic scenes",1385164800,,675,4.859649122807017
5315350,1,B009CCL7S6,"This is a terrible DVD-R. Much too dark! Hard to see, especially night scenes. Disappointed! I have read where other have the same complaint. What is wrong with Fox?",1377388800,4,165,4.724137931034483
5315351,5,B009CCL7S6,"Fans of Stephen Foster know there were three bio-pics made of his life. Released in 1939, ""Swanee River"" was the first. I like Don Ameche as an actor, however, there's not much opportunity in the film for Ameche to portray the drama and deep moods that Foster experienced. For example, there's not much drama when Foster's wife and child leave him, nor does the film effectively show his slide into drinking. This could be more a product of the times; not everything was as graphic and explicit as in today's movies. In addition, most of the support roles are somewhat forgetable. The noted exception was Al Jolson. It's fun to see him have so much screen time, doing what he did best. His recreation of a mintrel show was entertaining and informative. At the time of the movie's release, minstrel shows may not have been the most popular form of entertainment, but they would have still been familiar to many people.

Several reviews mention bad transfers, including scenes being too dark, or too light. My copy played fine.

The movie doesn't have the realism that contemporary audiences are use to, but Foster fans will appreciate how the songs are highlighted. In fact, sometimes it seemed like the makers of the film tried to write scenes as an excuse to include certain songs. Also, the film ""tweaks"" the facts a little, but then the film is far from a documentary and meant as way to feature Foster's many well known songs. The movie may not be entertaining to everyone, and I gave it a 5 more out of repect for Foster's legacy.",1375315200,,1535,4.660516605166052
5315352,4,B009CCL7S6,"Swanee River - the story of Stephen Foster is sad, but it is truthful of what happened to the young composer.

The music was very nice, and I enjoyed it, it was just that it was sad how he was treated.",1373846400,4,201,3.902439024390244
5315353,5,B009CCL7S6,"I was not distracted by the irregularities in the movie reproduction, after all it is from 1939! My copy played very well on my computer.  The production of this movie reminded me of ""Gone with the Wind"" which came out the same year, along with the Wizard of Oz, both of which overshadowed this movie.

The depiction of Foster's life was well done, even though there were some scenes, admittedly, that seemed contrived. Unfortunately, we don't know all the historical facts about his life, and, so, this creates some room for ""artistic license"". In one scene, Foster, played by Don Ameche, sings ""My Old Kentucky Home"" to Cristy's audience, with a beautiful, resonant baritone voice, even although there is no historic evidence that Foster ever performed his own songs publically. Toward the end of Foster's life when his career was in decline due to alcoholism and a change in public mood regarding his music, Cristy seeks him out in the slums of New York City offering his help, but there is no historic record of this meeting, to my knowledge. Nevertheless, the depiction of the E.P. Cristy Minstrel show, with Al Jolsen, was fantastic.  Al Jolsen has a great voice and replicated the Cristy Minstrel show beautifully. This may be as close to how these songs were heard originally back in the 1850s. Don Ameche does a great job in the title role as do the other supporting actors.  The music in this DVD is great.  This movie was much better than the 1959 remake, ""Jennie with the Light Brown Hair"", both of which are ""a must"" for Stephen Foster fans.",1371859200,5,1554,4.719557195571956
5315354,5,B009CCL7S6,As the keeper of the vaults for 20th Century Fox for 30 years I was not sure what this transfer was made from. The original negs were Technicolor three strip and a neg that old sometimes has reg. problems! But this transfer was great! No problems. No I'll buy the Black Rose and see how it faired!,1371081600,,297,4.228070175438597
5315355,3,B009CCL7S6,"I had been looking for this film for years and was delighted to see that 20th Century Fox had finally realeased it.  Plus, as I had only ever seen it on a black & white television, it was a pleasant surprise to see that it was in technicolor.  Unfortunately, my delight was severely muted by the poor transfer.  As other reviewers have remarked, the picture is dark, and, on my copy, the sound in several places has undertones that I can only describe as large marbles running along wooden planks.

A great movie like this deserves better treatment.",1357603200,16,549,4.571428571428571
5315356,5,B009CCL7S6,"This film contains some wonderful performances by the legendary Al Jolson but the film is let down by a poor transfer. The colours should be crisp, clean and vibrant but on this DVD the transfer is not great. The film is dark in places and the colours soft and muted.

Get the film to see Jolson perform, he is superb, but be prepared to have to put up with a transfer that is too dark in places.",1357257600,9,396,4.142857142857143
5315357,5,B009CCL7S6,"The movie, ""Swanee River"" is a little dark in spots, but the overall picture quality and the soundtrack are positively brilliant!",1357171200,10,129,5.190476190476191
5315358,2,B009CCL7S6,"The color of this print is fairly acceptable for the
most part, until the last 20 minutes or so where the scenes
become very dark and the colors are flat and washed out.
By comparison, Do You Love Me, Nob Hill and
Sweet Rosie O'Grady look great.

Regarding 20th Century Fox Cinema Archives dvds:

I urge everyone to contact 20th Century Fox
to tell them that pan and scan releases
of widescreen films is not acceptable...
Also, you might want to urge them to improve the
picture quality of their Cinema Archive releases,
especially the color films...

8539532,5,B009CCL7S6,"There are a lot of negative reviews for this movie, mostly due to scenes that are dark.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I first saw this movie on television decades ago and wanted to see if it was available on DVD but didn't remember what the movie's title was.  I knew Al Jolson was in it so I looked under The Jolson Story and eventually came across what I hoped was the movie I had been searching for for so long.  I watched it and was well pleased to find the movie I had been searching for..

The movie may not be completely historically accurate but it includes several of Stephen Foster's songs that Al Jolson sings.  The movie ends with what is assumed to be Foster's last song, ""Swanee River.""  However, I have always been led to believe the last song he wrote was ""Beautiful Dreamer.""

Despite the misgivings of various reviewers here if you enjoy Stephen Foster's songs I think you will enjoy this movie.  I enjoy his songs and I didn't let the listed defects in the movie ruin it for me.  In addition I have always enjoyed Al Jolson.",1391212800,6,1065,4.387755102040816
