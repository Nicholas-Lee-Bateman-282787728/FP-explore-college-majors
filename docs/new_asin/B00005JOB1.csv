7941155,5,B00005JOB1,"This is a lovely film. It is a ""road movie"" (mostly afoot) about a twenty-something Arab couple seeking their roots in their parents' Algeria, where they were born but barely can recall from childhood memories, very idealised ones, of that nation. On the way there is an interesting traipse through Morocco, and, before that, some sensuous and picturesque adventures and scenery crossing Spain.

Romain Duris outdoes himself in every way. His acting as the intensely fervent, possessive lover is all that one can desire. His body is, all of it, just what many viewers may desire, too. In fact, the film starts showing him at a window in Paris, sweltering in heat and humidity, as the camera shows first a sweaty patch of his skin, then gradually pulls back to reveal more and more of the full dorsal nakedness, then, when Duris turns to face the viewer, the utterly full frontal nudity of his splendidly fit (muscularly sinewy rather than bulky), nicely hirsute body. The camera truly makes love to Duris! The viewer, female or gay male, may wish to do the same. This is one of the most celebrated of Roman Duris' many nude scenes in his movies, films as sensuous as they are artistic, which, on both counts, certainly is the case for ""Exils"".",1387929600,,1243,4.75462962962963
7941156,5,B00005JOB1,"Evocative road film of the spanish, moroccan and algerian countryside and algiers, of immigrants trying to sneak by border personnel, their makeshift camps, warm family ties in north africa -- Dir Tony Gatlif excels at introducing such themes, just as in his film Latcho Drom about the gypsy migration from northwestern india to spain. This film takes that journey on to algeria. Some of the highlights include the flamenco and algerian 'dervish' trance performances. The music is also a nice blenc of cutting edge electronica with traditional. Great acting too. The only negative was that the film dragged a little at first, appearing to focus too much time on frivolous escapades of Naima.",1229040000,,691,5.123893805309734
