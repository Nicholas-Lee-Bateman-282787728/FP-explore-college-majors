8523880,4,B0081AWVC6,"Very likable anime.  Packaging looked cheaply done though.  The ""cover art"" on the dvds was simply the typed title.  But honestly, for the price, you get to watch the anime and it comes in a sturdy enough case.  So no true complaints.  ;)",1423094400,,238,4.441860465116279

8523882,1,B0081AWVC6,"I liked the series more as I went along, but JUST as someone found out the secret that was so important, guess what? The disk screwed up to the point that the main menu wouldn't even work! And now I've waited too late to return it...

Also, the disks are white with black letters. Kind feels like a bootleg. No music in the main menu either, and hard to navigate.

As for the series. It has some panties here and there. Can't remember if there was nudity, though.

Also, this series tried to be Strawberry Panic and failed. And seriously, I wish he'd had more time to become the Elder... he became the Elder right away within 3 episodes!! That's kinda lousy...

Although, as the series went on and on, I found myself liking it enough to give it five stars. The 1 star is because the disks were so awful that I couldn't even finish it, which saddens me like you don't even know.",1398988800,,877,4.296969696969697
8523883,4,B0081AWVC6,"I love Otoboku, it's a really sweet and adorable anime. I don't really watch that much of them anymore, but this was one I watched when I was younger and the price was right. Aside from the absurd plot device that kickstarts the story (the will) and the ghost character, everyone is reasonably believable and appears genuine. This is interesting considering the anime was initially a hentai game aimed at men. Instead it's pretty much a normal girl's anime with the tiniest of would-be lesbian romances towards only the tail end of it, and even that ends with almost zero fan service. As such, it's become a bit of a favorite of mine.

The only real negative I have to say is that the packaging is atrocious. The DVD case is durable and the cover is nice, but inside the discs are horrible. They almost look like blank DVD-Rs with ""OTOBOKU CLASSIC COLLECTION DISC X"" written on them. The content on the DVDs themselves is perfectly fine but the DVDs make the set almost look like it's a bootleg. If it wasn't sold directly from Amazon themselves, I might have even sent it back. I don't get why Media Works got lazy with this especially since the disc labels were already available and they still print them on some of their other DVD sets (I also bought their series Strawberry Panic with this one, for example, and it had normal labels on each disc).

So I'd give the anime itself a 4.5-5 stars but the packaging deserves probably a 2 at best.",1390348800,,1445,4.511450381679389
8523884,5,B0081AWVC6,"This is one of the few animes series without the bad guys continually getting off of torturing their victims. The humor is light, but picks up a lot in the last chapter, a fairy tales parody. The central character, Mizuho, has very high standards and develops high confidence without becoming arrogant or aggressive, the ideal of the Eastern ideals and values, so soothing...which are not quite commercial.
No wonder why this series didn't make here in the West. Even in the East plenty of the public enjoys quite the opposite characters. At least it fared better in Japan where they recently released the second season with new characters.",1374019200,,640,4.935185185185185
8523885,4,B0081AWVC6,"I really enjoyed this series. One of the best romantic comedies/harem animes I have seen in a long time. If you don't mind a bit of trap/cross-dressing/gender-bending I highly recommend this series.

The down side is though that the subtitles have to be turned on manually on each disc and on disc 3 the everything in the trailers menu doesnt highlight properly so you can't tell which trailer you are selecting.

But as long as you have a subtitle button on your DVD remote and you don't care for trailers too much you should be just fine",1372204800,2,539,4.546391752577319
8523886,2,B0081AWVC6,"Overall a good anime, but i'm not so pleased about this set.... first is that the inside of the case where the discs are housed is extremely thin & they can barely be held in place. Second are the discs themselves & probably why this set only cost me $9, they are so CHEAP! All they did was just slap a plain white sticker with some black text over it, that's it. It's quite sad because i've seen bootleg's  that look more convincing and this isn't a bootleg release.

Good anime for a good price, but not so good packaging.",1370476800,3,524,4.23
8523887,5,B0081AWVC6,"I bout this in Japans but I loved it, it makes you lafe and in some parts I felt sorry for Otoboku.",1366588800,,99,3.5454545454545454
8523888,3,B0081AWVC6,"Otoboku is about Mizuho, a polite and proper young man who wants to fulfill his grandfathers final wish; to attend the school his mother attended.

Slight problem. It's a Catholic all-girls school. Since this is anime, the only thing to do is cross-dress as a girl and go do it. With the aid of friends and teachers, Mizuho not only attends this school, but excels so much that he is elected elder, sort of a model schoolgirl that exemplifies the school's values and is a prime example of young womanhood.

Unfortunately, this anime tends to disappoint everyone. It's not as bawdy as others of its type, and is actually quite chaste; Mizuho acts as a perfect lady-er gentleman- and there's a bland, if sweet harem story here. Yet there's enough fan service at times to jar against that; you'll have a sweet little story about a ribbon, and then suddenly panty flashes, only to be forgotten again. It plays with yuri tropes, but never really embraces them. Most of the harem actually like Mizuho as a friend or ideal, and the love triangle is about two people who know he is a boy. It's hard to see who the audience is for it.

There's some decent extras, and the price is very low. It's sub only, and the DVDs look really cheap, with just big block text and no silkscreen at all. Other than that, it's all right for the price, and if you can get over the odd schizophrenic nature of the series, and the weird leaps in plot (why would any teacher be okay with a guy in a school, knowing he will undress with women? Why did young Mizuho in a beach picture wear a one piece girls swimsuit?) it's a decent watch.",1362873600,,1608,4.425675675675675
