The story boy loves girl boy can't have girl boy gets girl or some thing like that,you need to watch the movie. I have had this movie in my library for over thirty years and found I could buy the dvd from Amazons UK.Its a good movie for a cold rainy weekend when you just want to snuggle up with a bottle of wine a ragging fire and enjoy an old movie. PS.This movie is in black and white and looks great. ENJOY.",1356739200,,579,4.043478260869565
