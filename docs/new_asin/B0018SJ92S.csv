8270941,4,B0018SJ92S,"Although production values are very basic, this video presents valuable, immediately useful instruction.  Besides Master Lam Kam Chuen's Way of Energy, this may be the best video introduction to zhan zhuang standing meditation available.  It would be even better with an English audio track (hence the subtraction of one star in the rating), but the subtitles are serviceable.  I recommend Lam Kam Chuen's book/videos for absolute beginners.  Once you're familiar with that material, though, this would make a great next step.  The methods taught in this video can greatly and quickly enhance any mind/body practice, whether martial or yogic.",1426464000,5,642,5.444444444444445

8270943,5,B0018SJ92S,Chinese language with english dubbing. It serves it's purpose of teaching the Yi Quan Standing Stance Meditation. Worth more than the purchase price. This is what I call a quality made product best bang for the buck!,1396483200,10,216,4.864864864864865
8270944,5,B0018SJ92S,"This is probably the best introduction to Yi Quan stance training available, even though Bo Jiacong's contains more variations. The presentation is well organised and Zhang Shifu's instructions are clear and well translated for the most part. He leads you through a session of standing in Zhan Zhuang and mentally going through each body part and organ to relax. He describes variations and their usefulness in health maintaining as well as variations for people with disabilities or bedridden. He then proceeds to combat stances and presents each one and its purpose. Keep your eye on the student in red, he is the most advanced. Up to 3 students participate onscreen so watching this DVD feels like attending a class. You'll watch it over and over and hopefully focus on stance training for at least 6 months before moving on to Try Force (traditionally you do stance work for 2 years first - keep practicing and you'll discover why). Also the music is gorgeous. Always a good thing.",1378080000,14,985,4.904191616766467
