8113711,5,B000ERVKM6,Coscarelli is the one... And it rocked!  So far my favorite of the series.  Next to that is Fair Haired Child.,1179100800,,110,4.190476190476191
8113712,2,B000ERVKM6,"Well, I would like to give this duet of horror stories two-and-a-half stars - almost three. It's not bad. But it just didn't make much of an impression on me.

The first story, ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" is like a video-game version of the excellent horror film ""Wolf Creek."" In fact, it seems to land the heroine in a torture shed setting almost identical to the one used in Wolf Creek.

However unlike Wolf Creek, which has a sort of terrifying inevitability to it, this story has - I wouldn't say a twist ending - but a turn-the-tables sort of ending. But that's not enough to bring it up to the level of a really good horror movie. The villain here is an unrealistic, cartoonish figure. And the action devolves into pure gore fest.

""Chocolate,"" the second story on this DVD, is a little more imaginative and intriguing. But again, another movie does it better. In this case, Chocolate's theme is trumped by the 1970's movie, ""The Eyes of Laura Mars.""

So there are worthwhile things about this diptych of thrillers. But if you feel the press of limited time and limited life, better to just watch ""Wolf Creek"" and ""The Eyes of Laura Mars,"" which come off as classics in comparison.",1158019200,,1197,4.553488372093023
8113713,5,B000ERVKM6,"Volumes 3 and 4 in the Masters of Horror Series

return with Garris(Creater of the Stand)

and Coscarelli(Phantasm).

Garris's story is called ""Chocolate"":

It centers around a man who begins to

link telepathicly to a woman he has never

met. A very chilling tale with lots of twists.

3 out of 5 stars.

------------------------------------------------------

Coscarelli's story Is called

""Incident on and off a Mountain Road""

and is a survival horror masterpiece.

It follows a not-so-innocent heroine who

gets attacked only to return the attack 10-fold.

5 out of 5 stars!

Overall the series is fantastic and I cant wait for more!",1148601600,3,638,5.178217821782178
