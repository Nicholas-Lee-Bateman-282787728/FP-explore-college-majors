8091697,3,B000BS3G8E,I thought there would be more episodes of this wonderful show on the DVD so I was greatly disappointed to find only three episodes!!! Personally I would not have bothered to buy this if I'd know that beforehand.....,1343174400,,215,4.684210526315789

8091699,3,B000BS3G8E,"David Rocco, a Canadian Italian, returned to his native Italy, and brought us a glimpse of Italian culture, history and of course, doable simple Italian cuisine wherever you are.  The original series has some 12-14 episodes featuring all major points of interests in Italy.  This compilation unfortunately only covers 3 of the episodes.  It's a matter of judgement whether it is valued for your money.",1219622400,3,401,5.138461538461539
8091700,5,B000BS3G8E,"Anyone who enjoys the beautiful landscapes, historic treasures and live culture of Italy, AND would like to learn extremely simple recipes for delicious native Italian dishes, can do no better than to see ""Avventura""!  This is an absolutely delightful series in which the charming David Rocco takes us, not only sightseeing, but also into restaurants, workshops and homes to meet and see real Italians cooking, making artwares and, in general, celebrating their culture. Unfortunately, only 3 episodes of the total 26 are available on the only DVD I've been able to find so far(Lago di Garda, Lago Maggiore and Val D'Aosta). Hopefully the remaining 23 episodes will become available soon! They are ALL wonderful!",1154476800,8,712,5.245614035087719
