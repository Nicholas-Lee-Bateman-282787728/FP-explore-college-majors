He told his manager, in a moment of relaxation, that in one round he would make Ali pay for his big mouth, or in his own eloquent words: ""dust his dome off"".  One of the lessons Ali taught us is that we can never know what's coming, no matter how certain things seem.

Watch this fight (or slaughter, depending on your perspective) and ask yourself if you have ever seen a human being move as a fast as the young Cassius Clay does in this fight as he shreds the fearsome Liston.  I haven't.  Each movement of his body happens precisely as he wants it to, and as fast as he wants them to.  And all those cute ""this was a fix"" theories just don't fit with Liston's enraged attempts to.  As Ali put it later, ""If he wasn't trying to win, he's a better actor than I was.""

This is one of the greatest fights in boxing history.  We get to see the most formidable boxer in history take down a guy who liked to think he was intimidating and invincible.  Liston gets so desperate at one point that he puts ""blinding ointment"" on his gloves.  It only increases Ali's determination.

A must see.",1150156800,,1105,4.259615384615385

EVERYONE THOUGHT SONNY WAS UNBEATABLE(JUST LIKE FOREMAN 10  YEARS LATER)AND CLAY PROVES THEM WRONG. NOT WITHOUT A ROUGH SPOT THOUGH.  WATCH THE 2 ROUNDS WHERE CLAY CAN'T SEE BECAUSE OF THE INFAMOUS FOREIGN  SUBSTANCE IN HIS EYES. WATCH THE BODY SHOTS HE GETS HIT BY BECAUSE OF IT.  OUCH!  BUT CLAY STANDS TALL AND TAKES IT UNTIL HIS VISION CLEARS AND HE  CAN ONCE AGAIN ""FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY AND STING LIKE A BEE""",946771200,18,566,4.554455445544554
