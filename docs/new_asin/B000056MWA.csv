7932401,3,B000056MWA,"This work is VERY graphic, and very adult.

There are a few scenes where this is 100% hentai.

This was a very rough work. From what I read this the ""prototype"" for Mezzo:Forte which later gets commercialized into Mezzo:DSA.

DSA is the one I owned originally and picked up Forte and this because it completes the collection.

All and all... it's ok. It is so violent that it is far from a turn-on. It is more like a really edgy drama.

This and Forte are ok... just like DSA.

Not horrible purchases... just not really moving.

ON the flip side there is a lot of action in this.

There is also a rather sad story of a young girl being abuse and getting revenge.",1207612800,2,662,4.282258064516129

7932404,1,B000056MWA,"Now believe me, I'm a big fan of movies. I'm a big fan of anime. I'm a big fan of blood, guts, sex, and action. I'm a big fan of Luc Besson's assassin movies (""The Professional"" and ""La Femme Nikita""). I am a fan of stylish, sexy, implausible, and ultraviolent adventure yarn. I even like porn.
However, I am not a fan of ""Kite: Director's Cut"" (It was the DVD I had squandered my money on). I had first viewed the american release of this movie a few months ago at an anime club marathon. I was fascinated. I thought the animation was superb, the violence brutal and over the top, and the story intriguing. However, I noticed the film seemed unusually short, choppy, and lacking in areas of character and story depth. Then I was told that the director's cut had recently been released, and that it included 15 minutes that could not be shown in the regular version for whatever reason. Being the curious anti-censorship, pro-art guy that I am, I decided to buy this DVD and see for myself.
Boy, was I heartbroken. I wanted more depth, more story, more action, and I knew the scenes would be nasty. The new director's cut casts this film in an ugly light now and makes the watered down version seem more sly, subtle, and sophistocated. This is probably the first director's cut I've seen that I've hated, the first I've seen where I liked the watered-down version more.
Where to begin? Well, first off I'd like to say that this Director's cut adds absolutely nothing to the story. Oh, some scenes are added and others are longer, but that does not make it a better experience. There's nothing I hate more than rape scenes directed as if they are hardcore pornography. These scenes are sadistic in the tradition of most hentai (it seems the makers of hentai film are obsessed with young obsequeous girls in high skirts), appealing to fetishes that the makers obviously expect us to share.
Now, I'm not against rape scenes in movies, and I'm not going to give a lecture on whether or not they are ""gratuitous"" (it's a meaningless argument anyway--everything in a movie is gratutious, meaning that none of it is necessary), but what I am appalled by here is the careless way in which the film handles these scenes. We get to watch Sawa (and a new recruit) be molested and raped again and again, and in hardcore detail, I might add. Ah, you might say, this movie is SUPPOSED to be sexually explicit and shocking--this is vital to the plot. Well, to that I would say that the best criticism is a better alternative, and I would provide ""Ninja Scroll"" as an example. That anime film also contained a character who, as a result of her position and role, was also subject to much sexual abuse, much like Sawa. Yet ""Ninja Scroll"" was a movie that actually dealt with this issue instead of merely exploiting it. Kagero was a character with real emotions, real needs and a sense of longing. This was a film which did not dwell on it's rape or molestation nearly as much as Kite does, yet we feel her emotional pain. There is a real sense of poignancy when we realise Kagero had never truly lived, and when Jubei gives her the love she deserves on her deathbed, there is powerful emotion.
""Kite"" doesn't care much for dealing with the real consequences of rape--like all hentai, it thinks rape is erotic. It's only a brief moment of sexual pain (or pleasure) for Sawa, and then, in the severly limited role she is allowed to play aside from this, forgotten. Yet this film is classified as an ""action/drama"" and expects itself to be taken seriously.
But, of course, you can argue that the film needs these monstrous scenes because the villian must be established. He needs to be totally evil (as all anime villians) so that Sawa can be justified in killing him (to make sure she's completely justified, the film makers had him kill off her parents from the start too). What is this movie trying to communicate to it's audience? That rapists are evil bastards who deserve to die? If so, then why are the rape scenes presented as pornography and constructed to make us vicariously enjoy them as the director and animators obviously did? Is it just a sexy action thriller? No, the sex and rape scenes are too long and pointless for this categorization. Is it a love story between two agents? No, the movie cares more about it's action and it's smut. It barely gives Sawa and her newfound friend enough screen time to make us care about their relationship. This movie is about nothing, for no one. I enjoyed the watered-down version but felt it was unsatisfying as a whole, but this director's cut blatantly reveals the makers' hypocrisy.
After viewing the director's cut version of ""Kite"" I felt very, very dirty. And remember: I'm a guy who liked ""Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend"".",1060819200,6,4772,4.602112676056338
