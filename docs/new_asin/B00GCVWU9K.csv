8622187,4,B00GCVWU9K,"Wagners mammoth opera tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen is impossible to stage perfectly. No one production has all the answers to the multiple problems set by the composer and this Guy Cassiers version for La Scala Milan recorded between 2010 and 2013 is as imperfect as any in the catalogue. However, it does successfully carry out the primary golden rule of any worthy Ring production which is to accentuate the mythology so cutting to the very essence of the piece. On this count alone the production is well worth seeing.

Too many productions attempt to set the Ring in a precise time and place in order to impose some kind of directorial thesis on what the work means to us today. Some of these attempts are trite and laughable while others are stimulating and thought-provoking, but when all is said and done the Ring shouldnt be narrowed down. It is not just a pseudo-GBS parable on 19th century industrialization (Patrice Chreau, Bayreuth 1976). Neither is it just an expos of late 20th century consumerism (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, Munich 1987) or a history of 20th century feminism (Casper Ben Holten, Copenhagen 2006). And it certainly isn't simply a sterile traditional museum piece incarceration of some idealized fake mythic past (Otto Schenk, New York Met 1989). Wagner set his work in timeless mythology because he wanted to accentuate themes and central truths about human nature which stay eternally relevant in any time and in any place. Any production attempting to get to the heart of the piece must ensure that the sets, costumes and props chosen underline this core requirement.

Cassiers stays faithful to the spirit of Wagner with his idea of a wall of myth in which human bodies are entwined together in the manner of an enormous fresco as might have been created by Peter Paul Rubens. These bodies sometimes move and are often static as they make for a perpetually changing fantastic tableau that is revealed in various cunning ways gradually as the Ring plays out. It becomes clear that the characters on stage gradually take their place in this tableau as their lives run their course. Things become crystal-clear at the end of Siegfried which concludes with Brnnhilde and Siegfried singing their hearts out in gray clothing atop a gray Valkyrie rock in front of the (for now) gray wall of myth, their place in mythology miraculously petrified before our very eyes.

Gtterdmmerung charts how devious mankind perverts this mythology for its own selfish ends. In the Norns scene the rock is stripped of mystery as the rope snaps and the wall of myth becomes a hideous showcase of gruesome hacked-up body parts which represents the treacherous world of the Gibichungs. The process by which characters die and take their place in the tableau is shown with amazing clarity in the filmic images projected onto the wall of myth during Siegfrieds funeral march, and indeed this production is full of ever-changing very colorful lighting and projected filmic images which accompany the stage action from beginning to end.

Sometimes things get too complicated and distracting as what we see works against what we hear. Despite all the high-tech Cassiers still cant manage a scary dragon in either Das Rheingold or Siegfried. Even the frog is botched, though Grane makes a rare and very beautiful appearance at the end of Gtterdmmerung. Das Rheingold is the most problematic of the four stagings with only the appearance of Erda rising high above a moon-lit vista of mountains striking the appropriate note of mythic awe. I cant agree at all with the Rheingold ending as staged here with music conveying the irony of the Gods marching into Valhalla while we listen to the Rhinemaidens lament set to a jet-black stage with the Gods and Valhalla complete hidden with only Loge visable at the stage front playing the now customary (clichd?) role of stage manager. The irony of the music should be matched with the irony of the stage picture, not just a cop out in the dark which seems to be an economic measure to sidestep the problem of creating a rainbow bridge. From Die Walkre onwards though, Cassiers chosen stage imagery on the whole cunningly matches the narrative as it proceeds. Wisely things are always hinted at rather than directly hit over the head and we really do sense the physical geography of Wagners creation which so many other productions simply ignore  the bed and banks of the Rhine, the mountain tops, the forests, the Valkyrie rock, the magic fire and all the other natural elements as well. Costumes and props are carefully chosen to avoid any hint of historical time as we are encouraged to interact with the text with the sense of also being a part of this mythology in the making. This is perhaps the key point  that myth isn't just something created long ago in the dim and distant past. It is something that is forever in the process of being created. Present events cumulatively add up to the myths of the future. This comes over extraordinarily well in Cassiers final image as we are placed squarely in the La Scala audience as the lights go up to contemplate the wall of myth stretching across the stage front in the full glare of the light of our own reality.

Imposing a sense of myth by crafting a production around one central visual idea is hardly original. Gtz Friedrichs time tunnel (Berlin, 1980) and Harry Kupfers worlds highway (Bayreuth, 1988) both stated the Rings mythic timeless dimension very effectively, but they both imposed a dark monotony on proceedings which audiences found hard to take. Cassiers wall of myth is far less immobile and dreary as it is moved up and down, side to side, split into pieces and transformed into multiple guises. There is darkness when required just as there is extraordinary brightness which makes this Ring the most colorful in my experience this side of Keith Warners Tokyo production (2001-2004).

Where Cassiers production falls seriously short is in the lack of stage direction given to the singers. Too often singers simply stand still and sing their lines in the manner of an oratorio given in front of all the high-tech images with characters barely relating to each other at all. On this point Kupfers Bayreuth production wins hands down and remains for me the finest Ring on DVD. Kupfer captures the timeless mythology of the piece albeit starkly with very little on stage by way of props and scenery, and he moves his singers supremely well forcing the weight of the drama and all its themes through the acting and the singing to make for a Ring that above everything else is deeply human. The comparative stasis and dramatic inertia of Cassiers production is shown up especially in scenes 2 and 4 of Das Rheingold where characters stand on a crowded stage declaiming their lines directly to the audience as if their colleagues don't exist, even when the text demands they address each other. On Loge singing Deiner hand, Donner, entsinkt ja der Hammer! [From your hand, Donner, you're dropping the hammer!], he walks past Donner without even looking at him. Donner doesnt react at all and isn't even holding a hammer. This makes absolute nonsense of the text. Alas, it is commonplace in Wagner production these days and Cassiers makes a habit of flagrantly disregarding text throughout his Ring, another screaming example being the setting of the ride of the Valkyries. If theres one thing the scene needs its movement or at least the suggestion of movement. Cassiers Valkyries are statues in a ride of the Valkyries that doesnt even attempt to ride.

The lack of stage direction for the singers brings out the difference between the experienced ones who have learned their trade from people like Kupfer and Chreau and who instinctively know how to react, and the relatively inexperienced ones who haven't learned their trade from such masters. In the first camp there are John Tomlinson (Hagen), Waltraud Meier (Sieglinde, the Gtterdmmerung Waltraute and 2nd Norn), Nina Stemme (the Walkre and Siegfried Brnnhilde), Anna Larsson (Erda), Simon ONeill (Siegmund), Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke (the Rheingold Mime), Gerd Grochowski (Gunther) and Mikhail Petrenko (Hagen). All of them have a sure instinct for what their roles require and act with a conviction not apparent in the rest of the cast. Wotan suffers most seriously of all with all three singers hardly hinting at the depths of emotion crucial for the role. Vitalij Kowaljow (in Die Walkre) especially is in dire need of being told what to do on stage with important passages like the act 2 monolog and the act 3 farewell to Brnnhilde passing for nothing despite being well sung. Also stiff and noticeably plank-like are Johannes Martin Krnzle (Alberich), Stephan Rgamer (Loge) and especially Lance Ryan (Siegfried). All three should dominate the stage but never do.

Much criticism has been leveled at the dancing Cassiers chooses to inflict on us, and I cant stand it either. Im certain Wagner would have cringed, especially during Das Rheingold where we are forced to ponder all the vague gesturing while we should be paying attention to the text and listening closely to the music. Its all very distracting, but at least the dancing does originate from an interesting idea. The figures seem to come straight out of the wall of myth as representatives of change. Presenting the Tarnhelm as a group of dancers makes this obvious and leads eventually to a wonderful coup dthatre at the end of Gtterdmmerung act 1 when Siegfried changed to the form of Gunther steals the ring from Brnnhildes finger, done here by Siegfried standing aside watching the dancers (the Tarnhelm) smother the victim with a black cloak. Theres something wonderfully sinister here which is most impressive especially as most other productions tend to botch the scene. In Das Rheingold though sadly the dancing gets out of hand and threatens to smother the whole show. We don't need it for the three changes of scene (especially with very audible splashing of water) and we certainly don't need an already cluttered stage cluttered even more with unnecessary bodies doing unnecessary things. Alberichs transformations into a dragon and then a frog done by dancers surrounding him is both unconvincing and laughable. Nikolaus Lehnhoff in San Francisco (1990) and Keith Warner in Tokyo both show how terrifyingly well it can be done. The dancers hardly appear from Die Walkre onwards and it would benefit the whole tetralogy if they were cut completely from Das Rheingold as well.

Musically this Ring is frankly uneven and people shouldnt expect too much. Since the 1950s the quality of Wagner singing generally has been on a downward slide and today true heldentenors and dramatic sopranos are as elusive as the Holy Grail. The La Scala orchestra and chorus conducted by Daniel Barenboim are beyond reproach and produce a fabulous rich sonority though personally I'd prefer faster tempi with more fire in the belly. The singing predictably ranges from the excellent to the excruciating. Generally those mentioned above for their acting also produce the goods vocally. Tomlinsons malevolent Hunding is gloriously venal while Waltraud Meier delivers a stunningly feminine Sieglinde. Her act 3 O hehrstes wunder! is delivered with enormous maternal compassion as she cradles the splintered Nothung as if the sword is the baby Siegfried himself. As Waltraute in Gtterdmmerung she sings her Brnnhilde off the stage underlining the parallels with the closing immolation scene in an incredibly moving way. Nina Stemme makes a bright-voiced and steady Brnnhilde in the middle operas which eclipses for me her Glyndebourne Isolde. Shes in a class of her own today as a dramatic soprano. The best singing in Das Rheingold comes from Ablinger-Sperrhacke as Mime. A beautifully characterized vignette, he should really have been singing Loge instead and even the Siegfried Mime, though Peter Bronder there makes a good fist of the role. Overall Die Walkre is the best sung of the four operas, wobbly Valkyries aside. Despite the wooden acting (probably not his fault) Kowaljow sings accurately and firmly as Wotan as does Terje Stensfold as the Wanderer. Wotan is voiced best of all in Das Rheingold by Ren Pape who shows off an extremely beautiful noble tone. He seems rather stiff to me though. Perhaps like many of the others hes suffering from not knowing what to do on stage. A lot of the singing is on the safe side with notes hit accurately and lots of glances at Barenboim as he slows down even more to let his singers negotiate the more difficult passages. This is especially true of Lance Ryan who would have done better to relax and play the lout more. He certainly looks the part and is probably the best Siegfried weve had since Siegfried Jerusalem, but he is no natural heldentenor and the search is still on for a modern day Wolfgang Windgassen. Rgamers Loge and Krnzles Alberich are both sung well without hitting the heights or being very characterful. Watch the Kupfer Bayreuth production and you realize they don't really stand comparison with Graham Clark and Gnther von Kannen. Indeed, role for role and even note for note coming from the orchestra pit, the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring is still the one to go for. Nevertheless, if you fancy a Ring in state of the art modern sound in a production that gets most of the essentials right the Cassiers version is a fair recommendation. Just beware the pitfalls. Its very sad and bitterly ironic that as the quality of stage technology and recorded sound goes from strength to strength, so top quality true Wagner singing becomes an increasingly distant thing of the past.

8622188,5,B00GCVWU9K,"Firstly, I must qualify my review by stating  that this is only my second experience viewing this music drama and my first experience viewing the entire ""Ring"" so my opinion is very much to be taken with a grain of salt. I am vey familiar with most all of the operas by Verdi and Puccini and some of Richard Strauss. My only other experience with ""Siegfried"" was the ""Weimar Siegfried"""" which was so horrible and amateurish that it almost turned me away from ""The Ring"". Were it not for a chastisement from one reader of my review of that production and an encouragement by another reader to try another production, probably, much to my regret, I would not have ever explored the rest of the cycle.

This production is a huge improvement on the aforementioned ""Weimar"" production. This use of projections and lighting is used to great effect, especially in the awakening of ""Brunhilde"" in the final scene. Contrary to some, I thought the acting of all the principals were fine for opera singers...especially so for Peter Brodner's  ""Mime""; Lance Ryan looked the epitome of what ""Siegfried"" was supposed to be...an arrogant, rather stupid, young man ""who knows no fear"". The singing sounded fine to me, but then, I have never really listened to the great Wagner singers such as Flagstad, Melchior, Lorentz Etc., so my opinion in that regard, should  not to be taken too seriously.

The dts hd audio was quite good, but with little surround effect, the video very clear and sharp, the orchestral playing and Barenboim's conducting very fine, but then, I am not familiar with the recordings of the great Wagner conductors such as Furtwangler, Keilberth, Knappersbush  and Boehm.

A couple of funny notes: I thought the costumes which were a strange combination of different modern costumes, (""Siegfried"" looked like a biker and the women seemed to be dressed in evening gowns, and with Wotan's  and Mime's bizarre costumes they worked better than you might expect. I guess you might say the whole was better than the sum of its individual parts. Also I thought the extended smile line on the Nib lungs made them look like the ""Joker"" in The ""Bat Man"" movies.

All told a very fine emotional experience that I am glad I pursued....

8622190,4,B00GCVWU9K,"The performance of Richard Wagner's ( 1813-83) Siegfried at La Scala ,Milan fares much better than the two previous operas "" Das Rheingold"" and "" Die Walkure"" , thanks particularly to the final scene , the
 famous love  duet recorded by many famous singers from the past and available for comparison in many recordings.
The view of the magnificent rock with the sleeping Brunhilde on top of it and serounded by fire looks awesome. Nina
Stemme as Brunhilde is a possessor of voluminous voice , but her singing to my ears is not smooth enough and her phrasings are often broken particularly on sustained notes, but she looks and acts her part wery well. THe Canadian
Heldentenor Lance Ryan , looks and acts his part very well , but his singing. Is often course and he experience obvious shortage of breath ,which results in broken phrasing and legato almost non existing, especially when compared to the great heldentenors from the past , like Lauritz Melchior, Max Lorenz , Set Swanholm and Jon Vickers. The supporting roles are all taken by professional artists ,who sings and acts their parts very well. Daniel
Barenboim is unquestionably a great conductor and the star of this performance , but he is unable to achieve the same results as Wilhelm Furtwangler was able to make the same orchestra sound with more presence particularly in the climaxes.  In sum with plenty of reservation this performance of Siegfried is much better than the previous two operas. The video and sound is excellent and therefore it deserves four stars. Highly recommended.",1412208000,4,1552,4.893536121673004
8622191,4,B00GCVWU9K,"Siegfried, the second day opera in La Scala's new Ring Cycle doesn't reveal any new angle on what has come before or expand on any identifiable concept, but even with variations in casting it remains consistent in look and feel and has the appropriate sense of the epic scale that is required for this part of Wagner's masterwork. It benefits however from another robust performance from the orchestra under the direction of Daniel Barenboim, from some good singing performances and even one or two exceptional ones. When it comes to a work as challenging as Siegfried, you can't really ask for much more than that.

Guy Cassiers' direction and stage design is however also a crucial supporting element that brings a sense of wholeness and consistency to this Ring cycle. The production design remains fairly abstract, with little sense that there's any deeper meaning behind the concept, but it has a fine dark and otherworldly mythological quality that suits the presentation. It may not be naturalistic, relying more on lighting effects, projections, and dancers, but it creates an impressive spectacle.  At the same time however, it's a fairly basic and static staging that gives Siegfried and Brnnhilde very little to work with. This is a failing throughout Cassiers' Ring cycle, with very little attention paid to the acting and stage direction and only Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui's dancers providing any sense of flow and movement.

Lance Ryan's Siegfried is far from perfect, but he at least remains undaunted by the challenge and comes through the experience here relatively well.  He's often imprecise and strained in pitch, but he has stamina and enough character to fill the role in the absence of any real acting direction. On occasion, such as his fine soliloquy outside Fafner's cave, he's often good or at least good enough, which in itself is no small matter. Peter Bronder is a superb Mime; singing well and full of character he pretty much carries Act I. The third Wotan/Wanderer in this Ring Cycle, Terje Stensvold is also good, but it's a static performance that shows little personality or emotional engagement. Johannes Martin Krnzle reprises his excellent Alberich from Das Rheingold, injecting the Dwarf with the necessary darker edge here.

What really raises this Siegfried however and is worth waiting for is Nina Stemme's Brnnhilde. In Cassiers' vacant but spectacular production, Lance Ryan alone could never carry the weight of the third Act, but with Barenboim directing the musical force and Nina Stemme's beautiful rich tone giving it real emotional meaning, it gets there in some style.  The specifications of the Arthaus Blu-ray remain very fine for this series of Ring operas. Despite the darkness of the stage and the complex nature of the lighting and projections, the image is clear and stable. The audio tracks too present the singing and orchestral performance well in the PCM stereo and the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 surround. Other than trailers for other works, there are no extra features on the disc. Subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean. The disc is region-free.",1393286400,9,3135,5.101364522417154
