1865150,5,B00008WJBD,"First of all, I don't know what took them so long to start putting this show on DVD. I have been looking and waiting for months now. Well, it's about time because this is one of those shows that you need to get and keep. It's a good thing they put this show on HBO because it would have never worked on network or cable TV.
Arliss is one of the funniest shows I have seen. Not sitcom family funny, but adult only almost X-rated funny at times. Believe me, this show is not for the kids, it is adult humor all the way. Arliss Michaels is a sports super agent and the show basically deals with his everyday life and the headaches and problems he has to go throw. Everything from making deals between players and teams to finding the next big plan to make more money! Arliss is an original show that is very smart and funny. There are a ton of cameos from actors and sports stars that are fun to watch! If the sports world or sports agents interest you at all then you will like this show. It's a good time, pick it up!",1067558400,27,1016,4.110552763819095
1865151,4,B00008WJBD,"I find it ridiculously dense of people who think Arli$$ is nothing more than a show trying to ride the cotails of the success of Tom Cruise's hit. Further, I think it's pretty idiotic to pigeon-hole anything involving sports agents into Jerry Maguire. The world of athlete representation is a vast one, more entertaining and intriguing than 95% of careers in this world. What Robert Wuhl has done has taken this profession, satirized it, and made it an enjoyable show for people who are sports fans and fans of comedy. Does he have some similarities to Cruise's character? Sure. But most good agents will anyway. MaGuire is a character in a profession, just as Arliss Michaels is. You'll find Arli$$ is a better representation of Drew Rosenhaus than anything, but that would require research and knowledge of the industry....something some editorials have proven otherwise. All in all, it's a great show if taken at face value. Highly reccommend to anyone.",1059004800,7,956,4.98125
1865152,5,B00008WJBD,"I'm waiting for more episodes from this smart and witty comedy series which is easily the best show from HBO in a while. Whilst The Sopranos and Sex In the City get all the critical attention and Today show fawning Arliss is the show that deserves all the accolades. It is all due to Robert Wuhl, the goofy reporter from Batman, who would have guessed? But the guy is a comic genius and this show is great. Every episode leaves you with a smile, even when they are serious, which some of them are. The sense of life in this series is very benevolent, which is what makes it so much better than the other two HBO series. The DVD is of great quality, only adding to the enjoyment.",1056240000,9,678,4.263565891472868
1865153,2,B00008WJBD,"The title of this Arli$$ release seems to indicate that it is the first of a series of ""best of"" DVDs.  The surprising thing, however, is that I was unaware there was enough ""best of"" material to even fill a single DVD, let alone a set of them!
The longevity of Arli$$ is inexplicable, just as it was unbelievable that Suddenly Susan ran for so long in NBC's coveted Thursday night lineup.  Everything here is stale, from the hackneyed storylines, to the obvious Jerry Maguire overtones that may have been relevant in 1996, but have long since overstayed their welcome.
Save your $$.  This show ain't worth it.",1055808000,4,610,4.62962962962963
1865154,5,B00008WJBD,"Yes, I know...many snobby critics and magazines, along with SNL trashed this show over the years, but it was laugh-out-loud funny more often than not.  Robert Wuhl created a memorable character, with great support from Sandra Oh and Jim Turner.  The athletes (in their cameos) proved without a doubt they are not actors, but that was half the fun....watching them struggle!
A few of these episodes deserved to be award winners, and guests like Ed Asner and Ken Howard are at their best.
Thanks HBO for seven great seasons....longer than many critics' careers!",1055548800,6,559,5.0
1865155,5,B00008WJBD,"ARLI$$ was promoted in its first season as a sports-world LARRY SANDERS SHOW, and ever since, this fine series (which lasted an impressive seven seasons) has been kicked around and wrongly criticized.  SANDERS is rightfully respected for its acid show biz comedy, but ARLI$$ takes a different approach, with a solid regular cast of selfish but not mean-spirited characters.  Creator Robert Wuhl as sports agent Arliss Michaels is a standout -- a cynic with a heart of marshmellow.  The tone swings wildly but from slapstick humor to genuine pathos, and yet consistently scores, as Wuhl and company explore serious topics unflinchingly in this satiric context.  (As in the Wuhl-starring film COBB, a frequent topic is heroes with feet of clay.)  This is a fine selection of first-rate episodes, but it's a pity this Hall of Fame-worthy comedy has been such a whipping boy so as to convince HBO only a ""best of"" is deserved, and not full season collections.  I'm not a diehard sports fan, but the insider show biz stories, the quirky but appealing regulars and surprisingly sensitive treatment of contemporary problems has turned me into a stone ARLI$$ fan.  You wuz robbed, Mr. Wuhl.",1055376000,7,1182,5.0

1865162,5,B00008WJBD,This is a very nice representation of Robert Wuhl's delightful comedy. The supporting cast contributed to making this one of if not THE funniest sports related comedy ever produced.

1865164,5,B00008WJBD,This is one of the funniest shows ive ever seen. Excellent cast and characters. Robert Wuhl is fantastic as the super agent and will go to such hysterical lengths to get his clients what they want. What is the matter with the folks at HBO ? They need to release this show in its entirity. For the price you cant go wrong buying this but im pre-warning you...the show is so good you will be thinking the same as i do.

1865168,5,B00008WJBD,Arliss is funny. I love these characters that will do anything to make money. A lot of my friends don't like the show. I think it's because it was 7 years on cable and the DVD set only 12 episodes.,1384041600,,197,3.95

This TV series was brilliant, funny, & extraordinaire. It is the only show which I watch regularly on DVD because it makes me laugh.",1360195200,,273,4.269230769230769
1865172,5,B00008WJBD,Unfortunately I became aware of Arliss maybe the second to last year of its run. Really enjoy this collection of some episodes that I saw and many that I hadn't.,1306713600,,161,4.4
1865173,5,B00008WJBD,"This is a new program over on the HBO.  Do you enjoy the HBO, Paul?

DO you enjoy Robert Wuhl's work, Paul?  Yeah, well he's got a show over there called Arliss, and he plays...

He plays Arliss.

Do you enjoy the Arliss Show, Paul?

Yeah, well, he's, uh... he's Arliss.

1865174,5,B00008WJBD,"HBO is really making me angry by not releasing all of the Arliss seasons on DVD, this is by far the best show they have ever done. There are so many great episodes that I love that are not on this DVD collection, and watching the reruns on on regular TV at 3am does not do the show justice at all. C'mon HBO, you shouldn't be letting the fans suffer because you don't like Robert Wuhl. bring out all the seasons on DVD soon, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1216166400,7,449,4.294117647058823
1865175,1,B00008WJBD,if this is the best of Arliss volune 1 pray they don't make a volume 2. This was a great show when it was on and it was on for I think 7 seasons...out of those seven seasons it seems to me that they picked the most lackluster shows that they made. Very disapointing.,1207440000,3,266,3.9444444444444446
1865176,4,B00008WJBD,"This is only given 4 stars because it is a compilation instead
of full individual seasons. Arliss is by far the best series produced
by HBO and the repeats on regular cable omit a good bit of the
language that was present for an adult comedy. A great addition to any DVD collection.",1205193600,2,282,4.339622641509434
1865177,5,B00008WJBD,"I loved this show when it was on HBO. Robert Wuhl is vastly underrated, and the series seems to have gotten lost over time.  These episodes are a good selection, and Wuhl and the team are capable of comedy and seriousness without being preachy.  You'll enjoy it.  Now, if they'd only bring out the entire series....",1178928000,2,315,4.589285714285714
1865178,1,B00008WJBD,"If a full season is ever offered I am in.  I loved this show growing up, probably because of the adult content and the sports stars, but it is simply not worth it to have 13 episodes not in any order.  Full seasons would sell much better than these best of sets that are just trying to guage interest.  I bet if you look at how well the Best of Friends DVDs do it is no where near the compelte season sales.  Give us what we want.",1174953600,4,430,3.9080459770114944

We cheer them, we live through them, athletes are our last warriors.  My job is to make their dreams come true.  My name is Arliss Michaels, I represent athletes, these are my stories.""  This show is as good as anything that has ever crossed the TV screen. Arliss, Kirby, Rita, Stanley .. every bit as good as Seinfeld.  I hope Mr. Wuhl will come up with another long running sports oriented series.  He's a natural.",1138665600,4,537,4.363636363636363
1865180,4,B00008WJBD,"This is a great TV show. Sandra Oh is the stand out. Funny, sexy and a very good actress; she will get a lot of movie roles real soon.

1865181,4,B00008WJBD,"These 13 episodes from the long-running HBO series have plenty of the bells and whistles that make Arli$$ so much fun to watch: celebrity cameos, topical satire, swatches of deep poignancy, and pure silliness.  My big problem with the DVD is that it was an odd assortment of shows, from 7 different seasons, I really liked the shows but would have preferred them in a season format.",1130284800,15,382,4.701492537313433
1865182,1,B00008WJBD,"This was one of the first original shows that hbo came out with and their biggest mistake.  Its only put out as a best of on 2 discs.  Thats horrible.  Its not funny, bad acting, the only thing that makes this show even watchable is the sports stars.  If you get a chance watch mad tv they made fun of this dvd set on a sketch, now thats hillarious.  If you are still interested in buying this set i believe it is sold at finer car washes near you, usually free with a $10 wash",1107043200,4,477,3.9789473684210526
1865183,4,B00008WJBD,"Who can forget the side-splitting, sometimes raunchy (but hysterical) humor or Arli$$?  Answer:  The producers of The Best of Arli$$, Vol. 1.  The episodes that appear on this DVD are fine, but they are far from the ""Best"" that Arli$$ has to offer.

How can the producers of this DVD leave off the episode where Rita feeds romantic lines to Arli$$'s football player client to deliver to his er, girlfriend?  How about the episode where Stanley has to deliver a special gift to the IRS agent to keep Kirby out of trouble?  This is Arli$$ at it's funniest!

Let's hope that Best of Arli$$ Vol. 2 more accurately reflects the comedy that made this show so special.",1094774400,23,661,4.598290598290598
