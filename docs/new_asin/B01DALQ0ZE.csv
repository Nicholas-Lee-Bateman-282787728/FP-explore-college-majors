8755338,5,B01DALQ0ZE,"after watching all the content and enjoying the show once again i am here to tell you guys what i think. the steal case is beautiful didn't come in damaged or anything like that. the disks seem to work every time i put them in but they are blu-ray so they do not get damaged easy. my only twocomplaints about the item are that when i hit stop and shut down my bluray player in the middle of the show it does not pick back up where i left off. it does it on all three disks. i don't know if its just my blu-ray player or the disks but its just a small pet peeve i have about it. and second is the lay out in the case. disk 1 (season 11 is by itself, but disk 2 and 3 (season 12 and 13) are staked on top of each other. i know they had to do it that way but just don't like it that much. not enough to bash it a star or anything. also the dusk cover looks great on the steel case and feels like good quality plastic. the disks do have all the bonus content that i can tell rooster teeth release with it and they are great. over all i cant say one thing bad about the product other than the lay out of the disks. but again just a peeve so cant knock it a star.

for the show if you aren't familiar with red vs blue be prepared for an amazing time its hilarious and deep. one of my fav shows and these 3 seasons are amazing. it really shows how people can grow in talent and RT did a great job producing this trilogy.  hope my review helps you out in deciding to watch or pick up this set becuase it is a great addition to any RT or red vs blue collection.",1484179200,,1552,3.801857585139319

8755341,5,B01DALQ0ZE,"The perfect collector's case for fans of the Chorus Trilogy. Though now that I know these are options for the future, I'll definitely be holding off on getting the solo DVDs",1480377600,,173,4.612903225806452
8755342,5,B01DALQ0ZE,"I've been watching Red vs. Blue for a long time now, and the series has gotten more amazing with every season.  I gladly purchased this steelbook Blu-Ray collection and I really like it.  We get high-resolution episodes of Seasons 11, 12, & 13 (about 8 hours' worth) and then bonuses like commentary, outtakes, deleted scenes & PSAs.

If you're not familiar with the concept, it's fairly simple to understand:  the guys at Rooster Teeth were gamers who realized that Halo could be used to film a comedy:  launching the game and ""filming"" scenes meant they had a virtual environment with ready-made sets, costumes, and effects.  From there, they built a series of shorts into a longer set of story arcs, with recurring characters, and the rest has been a pretty amazing success story to see:  Red vs. Blue is still going strong while at the same time they were able to form the Rooster Teeth company into a powerhouse of a wide variety of animated and live-action content (such as the RWBY series that's growing in popularity right now).  The premise in Red vs. Blue is that there are two sides at war with each other--the Red Army and the Blue Army.  By this point, both sides have realized that they are part of an even bigger story, and their comedic mishaps tread into deeper, more dramatic waters, particularly with seasons 5-10.

We still love the original episodes and recently bought the massive 10-season set to re-watch them, but these stories are an impressive maturity for the team:  in the last several years Rooster Teeth have built a professional animation studio and gone into more depth with their writing and their characters.  There's still plenty of in-game machinima taking place here, but what I see especially in this story arc is that the look of the custom animations is more seamlessly matched with the in-game work.

Overall, highly recommended watching.  Language is ""R""-rated coarse, and of course there is a ""T""-level of videogame violence at times...but it's not just for Halo fans--the story stands well on its own.",1470614400,,2046,4.841954022988506
8755343,4,B01DALQ0ZE,"Not as good as seasons 1-5, but I do not think they will ever top those. Season 12 was the best of the three and had the most laughs. All three seasons felt overly long in my opinion and sometimes dragged a bit. Caboose is still the best.",1470009600,,238,3.9791666666666665
8755344,5,B01DALQ0ZE,"I already had purchased these seasons individually and never thought that I would purchase them again...That was until I saw this steel book! The art work is so simple and yet outstanding, and this is just the outside. Inside are 3 disks that contain the some of the finest moments had by the Reds and Blues and they are jam packed full of addition contents and outtakes that busted my gut and had me rolling around on the ground laughing for hours.",1467763200,,449,4.487804878048781
