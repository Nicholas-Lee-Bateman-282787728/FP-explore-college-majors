3737912,5,B001P4Q7RU,"This Bob the Builder On Site DVD shows how skyscrapers are built.  My 4 year old grandson likes it very much.  It combines animation with real life scenes.  It is educational, interesting, and entertaining.",1242950400,,206,5.0
3737913,5,B001P4Q7RU,"Fascinating to a 3-year old boy.  To be non-sexist,girls should also be given a copy.",1240963200,,85,4.666666666666667
3737914,5,B001P4Q7RU,"The On Site series is my absolute favorite type of Bob the Builder episode. Viewers are made to feel like they are part of an actual construction crew - watching workers build and getting a sneak peek inside the job site. Interspersed with the usual animation, this is a great video for kids of all ages. The dual imagery makes these videos equally educational and fascinating.

We learn about the construction process on two types of buildings: a skyscraper and a parking garage. Bob starts right at the beginning by drafting the blueprints and laying the foundation, then onto finishing the top-most floor and installing the elevator system. We see the contractor's view on each step of the huge process that becomes a skyscraper.

As an added bonus, there is footage of children building their own construction projects from cardboard boxes and craft supplies. What a great (not to mention cheap) project to try with your own children after the video! They can combine their imaginations with what they learned from Bob and his crew and to create their own unique buildings.

Skyscrapers breaks down the building process into engaging, easy-to-follow stages, incorporating Bob the Builder's delightful animation and charming characters, along with live action construction site footage. The sky has no limit in this latest title from everyone's favorite builder!",1238284800,6,1365,5.167420814479638

that sort of thing....perfect.",1380067200,,346,4.596774193548387

3738058,1,B001P4Q7RU,"This video is not classic ""Bob"". It is primarily comprised of video footage from building sites, run in fast play. Extremely overstimulating and headache invoking for not only the child, but the parents as well. This video was like Bob on hyperactivity mode, with little or no ""Bob"" at all.

If you are looking to create ADHD in your child, then this is the video for you.

For the first time ever, our daughter, on her own volition, took the disc and threw it in the trash can with disgust. So, in that aspect it provided a teaching tool in ""choosing what is beneficial"" for one's mind and sensory development.
Save your money, and return to classic ""Bob"". Hopefully he, too, has not gone entirely the way of the Sensory Driven Culture.
If so...pick Kipper.",1364947200,,758,4.607407407407408

3738061,5,B001P4Q7RU,"My 3 1/2 year old son loves the ""on site"" Bob videos. This one is great too. I like the combination of animation and real life videos, which are actually pretty informative.  It gets his imagination going and he loves to ""build"" things with his toy trucks just like Bob and the real construction guys do.  Its a good length too.  Not too long like many full length animation movies these days.",1360540800,,393,4.430555555555555

3738063,4,B001P4Q7RU,"Like all the Bob the Builder videos, this one entranced my son. He especially enjoys the ""On Site"" videos and the real footage of machines and construction workers. My only complaint about this video is technical. When we watched online using Instant Video, the last part of the film was cut off mid-sentence.",1358208000,,309,4.849056603773585
3738064,5,B001P4Q7RU,"My three-year-old grandson loves to see heavy equipment. He has tractors on his pajamas and on his sheets. He recognizes augers, excavators, rollers, and back-hoes from trucks and tractors. Bob the Builder seemed a natural ""vehicle"" for him to see what those machines do. ""On Site: Skyscrapers"" shows real construction of a skyscraper from drafting plans to assembling beams to pouring and finishing concrete. It shows the use of equipment, elevators, cranes. At a level children can understand, this episode teaches the value of planning, following a plan, and cooperating to work (or play) together. My grandson watched it to completion and we talked about it as we watched it. It might have helped that I bought him a  Deluxe Child Construction Costume Hard Hat Toy Helmet from Block Buster Costumes through Amazon. It has an adjustable inner lining.",1353542400,,853,5.136690647482014
3738075,4,B001P4Q7RU,I purchased this for my son who loves construction trucks and building sites.  It a great DVD showing preschoolers about how construction workers build skyscrapers and parking garages.

3738078,2,B001P4Q7RU,"This video was ok only. It was not a story like the regular Bob the Builders, it was sorta documentary like.  My son still enjoyed it, but I was disapointed enough to not buy any other ""on site"" videos.",1302220800,,202,4.17948717948718
3738079,5,B001P4Q7RU,It arrived right on time just as the others did.  Again the only problem I had was that the DVD was loose inside the packaging.  My son says his birthday was the best because he got what he wanted most.  He has watched it over and over again already!,1302048000,,250,4.061224489795919
3738080,4,B001P4Q7RU,"Well my son is going crazy over Bob the Builder - I think he likes the theme tune more than the show itself though.

I got the sky scrapers one because I saw the trailer and thought it looked cool.

It is very different from the other DVDs. Not sure if this is an official UK production either. There is no real story and is more like a documentary about how sky scrapers are built.

It uses a mixture of clay modeling, Paper animation, real life and CGI (Computer-generated imagery). The real life parts are real construction sites and children messing about with boxes.
I think it works ok and there is enough change to keep my son's attention for a while.

I don't regret buying it - but my son may appreciate it more when he is older. At the moment he is two and three months.
I played it for him and his cousins and they lost interest pretty quick. I think the short episodes keep the attention up. The 'Built to be Wild' one seems to keep the attention pretty good. It is filled with songs and story.
I still think the episodes are the right length for him right now though - so I will avoid any future 'on-sites' until he is ready...",1291852800,,1140,4.23963133640553

3738083,5,B001P4Q7RU,"I bought this DVD for my grandchildren, ages 3 and 4.  I never thought I would be writing a review of a child's product like this...but this one (and others, like Skyscrapers) rates high on my list.  The character Bob does his animated thing, then the same is produced in real life, then the activity is shown by real children.  The material presented in three ways is meaningful for my kids.  I would recommend this to all.",1263686400,3,424,4.467532467532467
