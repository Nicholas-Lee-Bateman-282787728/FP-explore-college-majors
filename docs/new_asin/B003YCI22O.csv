8408952,1,B003YCI22O,"-  This collection comprises of 4 color movies and 5 black-and-white ones.

- There's no video re-mastering. Consequently, all the color films are grainy, and so blurry that it's very hard for me to stay focused.

- The black-and-white ones are sharper but they are not interesting.  ""Go For Broke"" has some funny dialogues but the fighting scenes are bad jokes. Altogether, they consists of about six or seven soldiers on both sides. They clearly show the limited budget.

In short, these DVDs are a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and WASTE of MONEY.",1333843200,2,540,4.8901098901098905
