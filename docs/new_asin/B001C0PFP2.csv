8285638,4,B001C0PFP2,Very good background video to have on while you are doing other things. The women are pretty for certain. but why would you sit and watch it?,1387929600,,141,4.2592592592592595
8285639,4,B001C0PFP2,"I have seen a metric ton of Peach DVDs, some good, some average, some great. The explicitness of these titles tends to fall anywhere between Playboy lite to Penthouse medium. This one goes further than any other Peach DVD that I've ever seen, and ends with a stylistic departure for Peach: a stripped-naked monologue that will melt your TV screen with how filthy it gets.

Explicitness of course is good in these kinds of releases, so automatically that rates it high. The women are good, though not great, although all-natural Lisa Neils is among the best-looking women ever to appear in a Peach production. The quibbles that I have with this--and they really are just quibbles--are that there are only four women here (other Peach DVDs typically feature between six and 10) and because of that the vignettes seem to be a little too long and rambling. Production values here aren't as good as some Peach DVDs (great lighting, great camera work, good editing, but the equipment used makes it look a little low-rent), but I could live with that.

Overall, a great release and certainly worth a purchase. I don't quite understand the point of the title, but who cares?",1358208000,4,1166,4.796019900497512
8285640,4,B001C0PFP2,"Nice enhanced bodies. Good vignettes with each girl. Somewhat tame video,but worth the eye candy--good with clothes on or off.",1355961600,,126,5.35
8285641,4,B001C0PFP2,"It wasn't bad. You get what you pay for, which isn't all that much, but it was a good purchase. If you like the models (and have a strange obsession with food) you might as well pick it up for a low price",1354752000,2,204,3.7674418604651163
8285642,5,B001C0PFP2,"Another great dvd by peach super sexy scenes. My favorite was Erin Avery. Starts with in a ice cream shop with heather spreading ice cream and sweets all over her nice round tits. One scene has Erin with film strip. Also great solo scenes by Lisa Neils, and Miss Laura Lee. At the end Erin Avery gives you a special surprise that is super sexy. Great picture looks so clean. Only 1 softcore lesbian scene still hot. Includes photo gallery and 4 trailers. A must have for peach fans.",1354665600,6,482,4.426966292134831
8285643,4,B001C0PFP2,"BOMBS AWAY is another very worthwhile Peach DVD. All four girls (unusually few for a Peach DVD) are looking great, and the DVD is in the typical Peach format, with each of the girls - usually one at a time, although one segment has two girls - stripping completely nude and not hiding anything. It all stays within the limits of R-rated, though. According to the cover, the title BOMBS AWAY refers to all the Peach girls having large breasts, and in my estimation all of them DO live up to the billing - just look at the front cover to see what I mean!! However, none of the ladies is freakishly super-stacked like a 60 GG cup, if that's your thing. The image is good and clear, and in widescreen throughout. It has a mellow rock soundtrack that's decent. The whole thing runs 56 minutes, with bonuses of a good 3.5-minute photo gallery and trailers of 4 other Peach DVDs.

The models are in various indoor locations, with Heather Vandeven in a diner spreading ice cream on herself, Erin Avery in a movie studio getting tangled up in reels of film, Lisa Neils rolling around on a bed, Heather Vandeven on another bed, Erin Avery in an office, Lisa Neils with ""Miss""(?) Laura Lee caressing on each other in a classroom (fairly tame), ""Miss"" Laura Lee doing a solo striptease in front of a lounge and white curtain, and the DVD ends with Erin Avery in the same office but this time talking her way through a hot, romantic encounter with you, the viewer.  Erin does a great job with that last segment, which to me is the most stimulating part of the DVD. All in all, I'd say BOMBS AWAY is a winner.",1339977600,10,1595,4.403389830508474
8285644,4,B001C0PFP2,"This is one of the shorter Peach DVDs with only 4 girls. The only scene I watch is the one with Heather Vandeven who has some creative ways with ice cream. She usually has sexy scenes, and this one does not disappoint me. It is repeated in another DVD titled ""Bra Busters"" that also has Lela Star in a rather sexy scene, so I watch it more than this one. Why is it MISS Laura Lee but not MISS Heather Vandeven? Laura is in two of my Peach DVDs, and she does not thrill me. I usually prefer brunettes, but this time, Brunette Laura loses badly to Blonde Heather at left on the Box. Lisa Neils and Erin Avery in this one are not memorable to me.",1328486400,3,643,4.070866141732283
