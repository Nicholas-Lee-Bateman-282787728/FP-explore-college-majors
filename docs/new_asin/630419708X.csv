7864376,5,630419708X,"This is one of my favorite shows. I love Sally, she's a delight in ""The Flying Nun"", and ""Gidget"". This is the episode that flew her into our homes. I remember running down the stairs screaming for my sister to come and watch. This is the pilot show which aired on Thursday the 7th, 1967 at 7:30 to 8:30, {an hour long}on ABC. You don't see this show in it's full length on TV for after it was aired the first time it was cut down to a half-hour for sendication. This is a must for anybody who likes old TV pilot shows.",1042416000,4,519,4.048543689320389
