6531813,5,B00M0JTYF6,"I've been hoping to find this show on DVD for a while now, so I was glad when I found out about this. It's way cheaper than the other ones they have floating around here on Amazon (Or it was when I bought it, anyway) and it has every single episode of the series, but to be honest if you don't mind having a small risk of them disappearing on you, you can watch the exact same episodes on YouTube for free. There are absolutely no changes from the YT videos and what you'll find on these disks.

Personally, I prefer having a physical copy on the off chance YouTube does decide to take the videos down, but it's all a matter of personal preference. That aside, the package arrived in a good span of time, everything was in good condition and the disks play as they should, so I'm also super happy with all that.",1420934400,7,811,4.198717948717949
6531814,5,B00M0JTYF6,"It's just as the title for my review says. It's silly, corny, and ludicrous, but that's to be expected with a lot of shows that are based on video games. I saw this back when it played on TV in 1994 and was glad to get a chance to see it again after so long. I recommend this to anybody who likes battling robots, goofy sci-fi, and the Megaman franchise.",1419897600,5,354,4.071428571428571
6531815,5,B00M0JTYF6,"I remember getting up on Saturday mornings to watch Japanese anime cartoons they had on for kids and this was always the first one that preceded ""Flint The Time Detective"", ""Digimon"", ""Medabots"", and ""Monster Rancher"". Now, I can relive those episodes I watched as a kid and remember the exciting battles of the Blue Bomber who always beat the crazy Dr. Wiley in his outlandish schemes with his dog Rush and sister Roll. A must have for any fan!",1416960000,3,445,4.6455696202531644

6531817,5,B00M0JTYF6,"Came very quickly in the mail! Was exactly as described and was definitely a great gift for my husband, who is a huge fan of this series!",1414627200,2,137,4.111111111111111
6531818,5,B00M0JTYF6,This show is one of the better based on a video game in my opinion. It may be a little cheesy but the action is great and the show has a sense of heart that makes the characters likable. Only sonic Satam can top this show.,1412553600,12,222,3.847826086956522
6531819,1,B00M0JTYF6,"Unfortunately, there's not much to like about this series or this release.

First, let's start with the content itself: the series.  The Mega Man animated series was not very good.  Only a handful of episodes were any good.  The Beginning starts off the series decently enough but it's one of just a few watchable episodes, like Mega X.  The series art style was originally to be in the style of the games, as seen in the original series trailer as well as the Upon The Star DVD release.  Then there's the changes made to the series conventions.  Roll is now Mega Man's sister.  Proto Man is a villain working for Dr. Wily!

Most of the episodes are just downright painful to watch.  Curse Of The Lion Men, Campus Commandos, Night Of The Living Monster Bots.  Season 2's production values also went way down.  The animation is terrible in it and mistakes abound.  So, the content on this DVD set cannot be recommended, especially if you're a fan of the games.

This DVD set itself, however, doesn't get much love from me because of what the set could have been.  Even though the series itself was bad, there were plans to include some good extras on this set.  I was working on providing some of these extras when Capcom decided it basically didn't want to track down and secure any necessary rights to include extras.  Even though Capcom should, in theory, already own all of those rights!  I had made scans of the VHS box art for the first 3 Sony Wonder video tapes as well as the CD insert art for the so called soundtrack to the animated series.  I was also working on providing the original series promo animation trailer as seen on MMHP.net.  Other people I know involved with this project were hoping to provide commentary on some episodes.

So, while the episodes weren't necessarily of the best quality, there were plans to make this DVD set worth purchasing.  If you already own the ADV DVD releases, there's really no need to get this release.  This release just has the episodes, new box art, and new DVD menus.  If you don't own the ADV releases, unfortunately there's really no need to get this release unless you just happen to be a big fan of the series and didn't get the ADV releases when they were available the two times they were over the past 10 years.  The only way this release might top the ADV releases is in how the episodes play.  The ADV releases, when you selected an episode, just played each episode one after the other; after the last episode on the disc, the DVD play just unceremoniously stopped.  Not even the kindness to reload the main menu at the end.  Just an abrupt end of job!  Not cool, ADV.

EDIT: I've had a chance to start examining this release more thoroughly.  The episodes take up about 1.2 GB of MPG video.  So, the video quality does appear to be better than ADV's.  DiscoTek's release takes up about 8 GB a disc.  ADV's were about 6 or 7.  However, video quality doesn't mean a thing when you factor in the next attribute.

I've only begun watching the first episode, The Beginning, but the quality control on this DVD release seems to be very poor.  The audio is out of synch with the video!  I don't know if the other episodes are like this, but this doesn't paint a bright outlook for the rest of this release.  The Beginning was one of only a few good episodes of the series.  So, it doesn't do any good to offer it with such a sloppy presentation.

I finished what they called Disk 1.  The Beginning was the only episode on that disc that I could see any synchronization errors between the audio and the video.  So, there may be other errors on other discs.  Or this may be the only one.  However, such an error should not have occurred to begin with.

2nd EDIT: I found my copies of ADV's Season 1 DVD release.  So, I can give you a review of the difference in video quality between the episodes.  ADV split the first 13 episodes across 3 discs.  So, the prevailing theory should be that ADV's episodes are slightly better in video quality.  The only real measurement I have for that beyond an aesthetic value is to compare the file sizes of the MPEG video streams of each episode on each disc.  To get this value, I used DVDRemake.

ADV's Disc 1

Episode 1: 1328.71 MB
 2: 1286.34 MB
 3: 1278.25 MB
 4: 1279.64 MB
 5: 1307.12 MB

DiscoTek's Disc 1

Episode 1: 1238.71 MB
 2: 1286.33 MB
 3: 1031.30 MB
 4: 1033.31 MB
 5: 1047.98 MB

The tale of the tape says that Episode 1 is of higher video quality on DiscoTek's release.  Episode 2 is relatively the same size on both discs!  Episodes 3, 4, and 5 were larger on ADV's than on DiscoTek's.  Presumably, this should mean that ADV's versions of these episodes are of better video quality than on DiscoTek's.

Of course, this size difference could be all relative.  Such a difference in file size might not actually translate into a discernible difference.  However, both releases being standard DVD Video compliant discs, they should both use the same standard MPEG 2 video codecs.",1412294400,7,4989,4.472747497219133
6531820,5,B00M0JTYF6,"Before he was an NT Warrior, there was ""Mega Man, The Animated Series"" by way of 1994-95.

From the moment that the load screen for each disc begins, you hear the slamming synthesizer riffs from the show's opening theme. What you SEE is the 8-Bit image from the start screen of the iconic Mega Man Nintendo games from Capcom! Going into the episode menu and selecting an episode causes the disc to play through any episodes following the episode of choice rather than going right back to the Episode menu

THE SHOW

I assume that if you're reading this that you're familiar with the show itself. However, if you've forgotten, this was action Saturday Morning Fare. To lighten things up, Rush was given many of the same characteristics of Scooby-Doo down to nearly the same voice. On the opposing side, Guts Man and Cut Man acted more like the two stooges, appearing in EVERY SINGLE episode (Proto Man's inclusion in every episode at least made some sense; the brotherly rivalry between him and Mega Man was an epic one). However, Pharaoh Man and Top Man were epic enough enemies to have certainly appeared more than once a piece in the series. Also, look out for the few appearances of Quick Man, Shadow Man, Snake Man, Bright Man, Elec Man, Ice Man, Ring Man, Bomb Man, and others from the original five games (Strangely, Mega Man 6 was out by now but none of the robot masters appeared). Any continuity errors made in the episodes themselves are still on the discs as these are from the master negatives (In the opening episode, Cut Man acts like he can only throw his head-mounted scissors weapon, only to later be shooting multiple projectiles from an arm mounted blaster. Also, in ""The Day The Moon Fell,"" Proto Man is clearly seen behind Guts Man and Dark Man in a scene just before he's supposed to show up; then he shows up on cue and the episode continues from there. Minor goofs like that). For those whose memory of this is a little fuzzy as this was aired twenty years ago, some of these episodes can be downright goofy (""Curse of the Lion Men,"" ""Campus Commandoes,"" ""Electric Nightmare,"" ""Mega-Pinocchio,"" etc.) I don't mean to dismiss these episodes as such; they were actually entertaining in their goofiness.
P.S.: As you watch these, you'll discover that THE COMMERCIAL BUMPERS ARE INTACT! (Save for the commercials, of course). Therefore, the action is interrupted just long enough to hear (for my favorite classic example) ""RUFF, RUFF. REGA, REGA! RIGHT RACK! RESSAGES. ROO-ROO!""; followed by the return bumper.
Anyway, there you have it.",1412121600,31,3464,4.695222405271829
6531821,5,B00M0JTYF6,"This contains all of the TV shows from Seasons 1 & 2 in chronological order. Additionally, Discotek created a great retro box art as you can see and 8bit NES style DVD menu.

There's no extras or anything new but Discotek media has always done some high quality releases. The shows are still NTSC interlaced (480i) presumably taken right from the broadcast masters like with the previous DVD releases so don't expect any quality improvement.

If you have the old ADV sets you aren't missing anything except for the 8bit NES menu and cool box art, and getting the shows in the proper order (at least according to Wikipedia and the Australian Pal release).",1411430400,16,654,4.728070175438597

I was a bit confused when I received the sealed dvd case and it looked worn and used, but then I realized that's the point. They intentionally made the case look like an old vhs and the description and pictures featured on the back are hilarious. The whole thing totally feels like it popped out of the 90's.

6531959,5,B00M0JTYF6,"It's pretty much the same transfer as the older sets. I couldn't tell much if any difference between the two after close frame by frame examination.

If you bought them already, then no need to get this. If you didn't but them already or they are overpriced to you, then is a fair deal that's for sure.

Don't expect a video quality upgrade though, it didn't look any different to me and they crammed more episodes into each disc so they might be a lower bitrate or compressed more.

This show certainly isn't as appealing as when you were a child because you've grown up and it seems corny, but if you grew up with it, you will probably still enjoy it like I do.",1439856000,2,663,4.288

6531996,5,B00M0JTYF6,"Got my 7 year old son to start playing old NES games, and he gravitated towards the Mega Man series as being his favorite.

So I picked up the series to show him and feed the obsession. He really enjoyed it, and we burned them all off in just a few weeks. He thought it was great fun identifying the various robots that made appearance in the cartoon.

It's not the best cartoon around, but it's solidly pretty good. And the packaging was made up to look like an old Nintendo box, with the discs printed like cartridges. The menus were the top of the skyscraper from Mega Man II. Props to the packaging department.",1425945600,,614,4.3304347826086955
6531997,4,B00M0JTYF6,"I recieve this DVD in the mail in due time. I was very happy came a day earlier then they stated however was kinda devastated when I hear a sound in the package! One the disc came lose (1st disc) and was shifted around. (Around the corner of the DVD plastic coever was broken as well!) I was worried would not play for originally intend to buy for my 10 year old niece who was rediscovering video game iconic characters like Pac-man and Mega Man for was curious about them in her Super Smash Bro.s for the Nintendo 3DS game.

Thankfully the disc play despite some scratches. I would give this 5/5 stars but the mail shipping kinda ruin the moment.
(My niece joke they should put stickers on packages saying ""Handle with Care"" or something.)

All in all, was a nice nostalgia trip down memory lane and my niece loves this series to bits.",1425513600,,836,4.387096774193548
