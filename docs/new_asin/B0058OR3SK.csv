8462098,1,B0058OR3SK,"1 star is too much. First there's a story that doesn't have a story line, just a bunch of made up stuff, people acting weird. Creepy photographer with a hair fixation (He keeps brushing hair from his face and adjusting his glasses.) has a creepier girlfriend who sits on a table and watches him ""work."" They end up outside and another character ends up unconscious on a beach. And then, well, this just makes  no sense. There's a lot of ""arty"" photo angles that do nothing to let us see into the mind of this, so called, psycho. And to top things off, the whole last third of the film is interviews and outtakes. Like we care about these no-name, so-called artists. Stop me if you've heard this - Yeesh!",1395532800,,703,4.407692307692308
8462099,5,B0058OR3SK,"Hot chicks & a scary psycho with a camera.  I loved it.  A little disturbing at times because the whole ""model gets duped by sicko"" thing has happened, so it seemed kinda real. But very well put together",1384128000,,203,4.315789473684211
8462100,4,B0058OR3SK,"Really well executed. Hot girls get tortured by a creepy photographer. I wasn't sure if that would be enough to keep an entire movie going--but it SO was! Twists & turns keep the movie interesting, and there are enough sexy & disturbing scenes peppered throughout to satisfy anyone who is into such things. I loved it.",1374969600,2,318,4.696428571428571
8462101,4,B0058OR3SK,The Photographer was based on actual events which makes it even more disturbing. Really held my attention. I'd recommend it.,1374710400,,124,5.25
8462102,4,B0058OR3SK,I didn't realize until after I had watched this that it was based on true events. Freaky stuff. This is a real glimpse into some twisted s@#$. Not for the faint of heart.,1362355200,,170,4.181818181818182
