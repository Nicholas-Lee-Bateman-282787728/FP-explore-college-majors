7888050,4,6305371547,"Retitled BASTARD KUNG FU MASTER as part of Xenon's low-cost ""Wu Tang Forbidden Treasures"" line, the actual title of this film is RING OF DEATH (1980), directed by Taiwan-based kung fu filmmaker Ng See Yuen (SECRET RIVALS, INVINCIBLE ARMOR). It's a consistently exciting kung fu film that offers an endearing central character, some clever training scenes and lots of superbly staged bouts, including an intense finale between star Cliff Lok and guest villain, high-kicker Hwang Jang Lee.
Lok plays an underdog hero, disowned by his wealthy father and picked on by his three half-brothers, who has to turn outside the family for the kung fu training he craves. He gets it from an unlikely couple: a middle-aged drunk (Shih Kien) and his super-competitive wife (Lynda Lin) who take turns teaching him their different styles without the other knowing it. In the course of this grueling instruction the husband and wife uncover a secret about their two styles that greatly benefits young Lok.
Lok returns to his family just in time for the big tournament, staged at an outdoor stadium before an audience which includes the Emperor and visiting dignitaries. Russia's champ, played by long-limbed Hwang Jang Lee, defeats all other contenders until Lok, dressed up as the Japanese champ, climbs up to the massive wooden platform built for the tournament and takes on Hwang in a sprawling final bout that requires all of his newly acquired expertise. Lok is at his best here and his performance will certainly delight fans of his other works, which include KUNG FU GENIUS and OL' DIRTY KUNG FU. Frequent villain Hwang Jang Lee is, of course, well known to serious kung fu buffs for such films as HITMAN IN THE HAND OF BUDDHA and HELL'S WINDSTAFF, among many others. As of this writing, RING OF DEATH is only available in this low-cost but above-par Xenon VHS edition.",1051488000,3,1859,4.942492012779553
