8273425,5,B0019CW0HY,This is a most incredible movie.  It is a real pity that it is not compatible with U.S. DVD players.  A touching story about a WWI soldier attempting to reconcile his conscience after killing a German soldier face-to-face.  Has a very satisfactory ending and really makes you think.  Hopefully will be able to find it U.S. compatible at some point.,1292716800,2,348,4.75
